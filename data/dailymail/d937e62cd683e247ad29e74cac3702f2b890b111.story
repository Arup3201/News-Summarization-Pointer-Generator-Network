Paralysed: Little Thusha Kamaleswaran will never walk again after she was shot through the chest while playing in her uncle's shop in Stockwell Road, south London

A girl of five ‘died’ twice after being shot by three masked suspected gang members trying to gun down a rival, a court was told yesterday.

Thusha Kamaleswaran took a bullet in the chest as she played beside her parents in the aisle of her uncle’s grocery shop.

She was hit by one of two shots fired through the open door by young men circling outside on bicycles after their intended victim fled into the shop.

Her life was saved by paramedics who operated on her in the street after the bullet passed through her body.

And surgeons brought her back to life again as she suffered a heart attack during emergency surgery in hospital.

But Thusha was left permanently paralysed from the waist down and will never walk again after the shooting in Stockwell, South London.

Her parents were at the Old Bailey yesterday as three young men went on trial accused of offences including attempted murder.

They are suspected of being gang members who wanted to kill a rival in the latest episode of a violent feud.

Prosecutor Edward Brown QC said that instead they hit two innocent bystanders who were both ‘remarkably lucky’ to survive.

‘One was a five-year-old girl. You will see the moment she was shot. It was captured on CCTV. The other was a 35-year-old man.

‘All he was doing was getting provisions from his local shop. He suffered a bullet wound to his face. You will see that moment also.’

Thusha was gunned down as she played in the aisle of Stockwell Food and Wine on the evening of March 29 last year. Her older brother and younger sister narrowly escaped injury.

The prosecution said Thusha ‘must have been in sight of the gunman’ and possibly his accomplices as they stopped outside on bicycles.

The bullet came out of her back and she underwent ‘invasive surgery’ in the street as paramedics battled to keep her alive.

She was taken to King’s College Hospital in an ambulance under police escort where surgeons performed another emergency operation.

Mr Brown said the masked gunmen were on a ‘determined mission’ to kill a rival, Roshaun Bryan.

‘Three young men on bicycles, with their faces partially concealed by masks, pursued their intended victim forcing him to take refuge in a shop.

‘One of the young men was armed with a handgun.  The evidence demonstrates that they were likely to have been looking for members of a rival gang. They thought they had succeeded.

‘They circled together outside the shop on their bicycles. One shot was fired. The gunman pulled up again immediately outside the shop, held up the handgun again and fired a second shot through the open door.

‘It may be that there were attempts to fire the gun more than twice. The shots missed their target and struck  two completely innocent bystanders.’

Mr Brown added: ‘The reality of this shooting may be that while there was an intention to kill the suspected rival gang member, the gunman and his accomplices could not have cared less if someone else was shot too.’

The second victim, Roshan Selvakumar, 35, who was chatting to the owner before returning home to his  flat above the shop, was hit in  the face but miraculously survived.

The court heard that if the shot had been a tiny distance to the left or right he would ‘surely’ have been killed and the bullet fragments remained in his head because it was too dangerous to remove them.

Nathaniel Grant, 21, and Anthony McCalla and Kazeem Kolawole, both 19, are accused over the shooting. Grant is accused of pulling the trigger.

Mr Brown said all were alleged members of a gang involved in rivalry with another. ‘The immediate legacy of that gang violence lies in Thusha’s permanent disability and the bullet that remains in Mr Selvakumar.’

‘There can be little doubt that not only was Roshaun Bryan in the line of sight of the gunman but also that Thusha, there in the shop, was in the line of sight.’

The three defendants, all from South London, deny attempting to murder Mr Bryan, causing grievous bodily harm and firearms offences.

The trial continues.
