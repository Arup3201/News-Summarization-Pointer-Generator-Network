Steven Gerrard will meet his new LA Galaxy boss for the first time this week.

The outgoing Liverpool skipper has arranged a face-to-face get together with Bruce Arena ahead of his July move to America.

Gerrard spoke of the MLS club's 'aggressive pursuit' of his signature before announcing his 18-month megabucks deal last month. But club commitments means Gerrard has yet to meet his new management team.

Ex-USA coach Arena plans to head to Merseyside from the Galaxy's pre-season training camp in Ireland. He is also set to take in the Europa League first-leg tie with Besiktas at Anfield with Thursday.

Arena said: 'I'm looking forward to shaking Steven's hand and welcoming him personally.

'We will have a chance to talk about our club and expectations. Without a doubt he is going to be a great addition.'
