Thanks to Tinder, it's never been so quick and easy to shop for a man, and now with fashion app Grabble you can shop for a new wardrobe with equal ease.

The newly launched app works just like Tinder but rather potential dates popping up on  screens, users are tempted with lust-worthy fashion.

Style hunters swipe right to 'grab' a potential fashion match and swipe left to reject items that don't tickle their fancy.

New fashion app Grabble is to fashion what Tinder is to dating - a quick and easy way to find a match

No wonder Grabble has been the featured in the 'best new app' section in app stores in 34 countries, and over Black Friday was the most searched for app in the UK.

It's been a hit with celebrity users too. Stephanie Pratt, Andy Jordan, Caggie Dunlop, Frankie Cocozza are all Grabble users, as is Ferne McCann, who appeared at the apps official launch last week.

But be warned - it might not be quite so easy to swipe away potential fashion matches as it is to reject the frogs on Tinder.

Once users grab an item it stays in the 'grabs on the go' folder until they decide to buy or discard it.

For a more curated experience, users can also shop in the 'featured collections' section, as shown above

The best part? The clever little app will send alerts whenever  a grabbed item comes on sale.

So how does the art of fashion match-making work? Users set preferences according to price range, brand and category of clothing.

The app features products from 1,500 brands from ASOS, Topshop, Uniqlo and Zara to the likes of Net A Porter, Matches and Selfridges. 

Shoppers can also set the app to recognise their taste by choosing as many of the 23 styles that best describes their fashion groove.

So whether users see themselves as 'Made In Shoreditch', 'Chelsea Girl' or 'Boho Babe' - they can tailor  potential fashion matches to suit.

For a more curated experience, there's the 'featured collections' section, which is added to daily. Example collections include items from recent magazine issues, best bargains or picks for upcoming events.

Just like Tinder, men are welcome too: David Beckham modelling (left) and a selection of male grabs (right)

Founders Daniel Murray, 28, and Joel Freeman, 29, first launched Grabble as a desktop site but after seeing all their users trying to access it on their mobiles decided to abandon their website for an app in the mould of Tinder.

'We realised by displaying fashion products in this way, users could discover fashion on the go,' says Joel, himself a self-confessed Tinder fan. 'But instead of swiping right for awkward conversations, you can swipe right to shop.'

Daniel adds: 'Because the app has that addictive nature we find our users 'snacking' on the app regularly for short bursts of inspiration.

'Users tend to save the products they like, only to check out later in the month in one big spree or when they get a sale alert.' 

With new products added to Grabble every hour, there's endless potential to fall in fashion love.
