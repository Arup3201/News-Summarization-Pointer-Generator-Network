Circus staff have been warned by police after taking a  2.5 tonne rhinoceros for a walk in Germany without any restraints.

Panicked locals in the town of Luckenwalde called authorities after spotting the rhino, nicknamed Hulk, walking along the road without any lead or restraints.

But by the time police got to the scene the animal was back at the Circus Voyage site along with its keeper.  

Police stood down, but hours later they received another call claiming a rhino had escaped.

This time they caught the animal's keeper and circus director walking the rhino to the local park.   

Police spokesman Marcus Braun said: 'The circus staff were given a stiff talking to by the officers, and warned that it was not allowed to take rhinos onto the streets.'

The circus said they did not understand the fuss over the 34-year-old rhino being allowed to get some fresh air, and added that Hulk was completely tame and unlikely to harm anyone. 

The animal's keepers rejected the idea of putting the rhino on a lead when they walked him.

The same rhinoceros sparked a similar alert three years ago after he escaped from the circus while it was performing in the town of Goslar in Lower Saxony.
