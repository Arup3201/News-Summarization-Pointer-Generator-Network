The Olympic torch returned to Earth safely today when the Russian Soyuz space capsule landed in Kazakhstan after its first ever walk through space.

The capsule arrived with clear weather at 8:49 a.m. local time Monday (9:49 p.m. ET Sunday) in Central Khazakstan with three members on board.

Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin, NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg and Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano proudly returned the torch after having spent five and a half months in space.

Bye, station," Yurchikhin said as they left for Earth.

'Bye-bye,' Nyberg commented.

'See you, soon,' Parmitano said as he prepared to return.

Yurchikhin said he and his crew will return the torch to the Olympic Committee after landing.

NBC reports the trio originally flew out to space in May as part of the six Expedition 37, a six person crew.

They had an event filled mission and welcomed a visiting cargo ship from Japan, the first-ever robotic Cygnus spacecraft, a commercial cargo ship built by the U.S. company Orbital Sciences.

The Expedition's former head, Yurchikhin passed down the chain of command to Oleg Kotov who now leads a crew named, Expedition 38.

In February, the torch will be displayed during the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

Karen Nyberg spoke about being the only woman aboard the mission and speaks of her close relationship with her fellow crew members.

'These guys are like a group of brothers for me.These guys are all great, so it's been fantastic.'

Nyberg, a fan of social media, was the first ever astronaut to post on Pinterest from space and often updated her Twitter.

Parmitano broke records by becoming the first Italian astronaut to have two orbital outings. One of those outing was a near death experience in which there was a scary water leak in his space helmet.

'What I am going to miss above everything is the idea of being here, living weightless in this extraordinarily environment,'Parmitano said Friday.

Expedition 38 Includes crew Kotov, Tyurin, Mastracchio Wakata, and  NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins and cosmonaut Sergey Ryazanskiy.

Below are photographs of the spectacular moment two Russian cosmonauts took the OIympic torch on its first historic spacewalk ahead of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi during Expedition 37. 

Historic: Oleg Kotov proudly waves an unlit version of the Olympic torch outside the International Space Station

Stunning: He holds the feather-shaped symbol in his gloved hand while floating 260 miles above Earth

Mission: Sergei Ryazansky gives Mr Kolov instructions outside the space station. Their spacewalk was beamed live across Russia by state television

A 'beautiful' moment: The pair took turns to hold the red-and-grey torch, which was tethered tightly to their bulky spacesuits

Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky 
carried an unlit version of the feather-shaped symbol through the hatch 
of the International Space Station.

Live footage captured Mr Kotov proudly waving the torch in his gloved hand - while floating 260 miles above the Earth.

The moment, captured on high-tech video and photo equipment, was beamed live across Russia by state television.

Mr Kotov and Mr Ryazansky can be seen taking turns to hold the red-and-grey torch, which was tethered tightly to their bulky spacesuits.

Their conversation mainly consists of complicated space jargon - with Mr Kotov
having previously warned that he did not intend to make a 'grand pronouncement' similar to the one Neil Armstrong delivered when 
he took his first step on the Moon in 1969. 

Safety: The torch was required to remain unlit while inside the space station due to safety precautions. It was not able to emit flames in open space due to the lack of oxygen

However, Mr Sergei can be heard calling the historic moment 'beautiful'.

This was the first time the Olympic torch had been taken into open space - but it was not able to emit flames due to the lack of oxygen.

Space officials had also stressed that safety precautions meant it had to remain unlit while inside the space station. 

Despite this, Russia had previously 
contemplated sending the actual flame up to the station by encasing it 
in a special lantern.

However, senior 
officials eventually decided that lighting a fire aboard a Soyuz rocket 
filled with tonnes of explosive fuel was not a wise choice.

An
onboard camera showed Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata pumping the air 
with his fist as the Soyuz rocket lifted off from the Russian-rented 
Baikonur Cosmodrome.

After
a six-hour trip to the station, Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin 
crawled through a hatch and handed the unlit torch to his beaming 
countryman on board, Fyodor Yurchikhin.

Wakata, Tyurin and Mastracchio sat 
beneath a stuffed polar bear in a blue scarf, a mascot of the first 
Olympics Russia has hosted since the Soviet era.

The spacewalk is part of what will be the longest torch relay before a 
Winter Olympics that President Vladimir Putin hopes will improve burnish
international image.

The
Olympic torch has gone on voyages aboard spacecraft twice before, in 
1996 and 2000, but it has never been taken into open space.

'This is a way to show the 
world what Russia is made of,' Dmitry Kozak, the deputy prime minister 
Putin put in charge of planning the Olympics.

Inspired
by the Firebird of Russian folklore, the metre-long, red-and-silver 
torch weighs almost 2 kilograms on Earth but it floated in zero gravity.

As part of its 40,000-mile relay, the torch has travelled to the North Pole on an atomic-powered ice breaker. 

It
still has to go to the peak of Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus,
and the depths of Siberia's Lake Baikal before reaching Sochi on the 
Black Sea for the start of the Games on February 7.

The US government recently advised people going to the Games to leave 
their laptops and mobile phones at home over fears of spying, according 
to research by journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan.

The
SORM surveillance system will allow the body to listen in on all 
communications in and out of the Olympic venue at Sochi in February.

It will allow security services to 
bug the communications of anyone without having to show providers court 
orders allowing the eavesdropping, the analysts said.

Russia
has pulled out all the stops to get the subtropic region ready for the 
Games, spending more than $50 billion (37 billion euros) in state and 
corporate money on infrastructure improvements.

International Olympic Committee 
president Thomas Bach insists the Olympic Charter will be respected at 
the Sochi Winter Games despite Russia's new law on homosexuality.

Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a law in June making it illegal to give under 18s information about homosexuality.

The move has been widely condemned and has led to calls for a boycott of next year's event.

The issue caused controversy at August's athletics World Championships in Moscow.

Russian
athlete Yelena Isinbayeva labelled Swedish high-jumper Emma 
Green-Tregaro 'disrespectful to our country' for protesting against the 
law by painting her nails in rainbow colours while United States runner 
Nick Symmonds dedicated his world 800 metres silver medal to his gay and
lesbian friends.
