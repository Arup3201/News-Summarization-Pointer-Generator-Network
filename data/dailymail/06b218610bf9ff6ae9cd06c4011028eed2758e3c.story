It's a pivotal policy for the Federal Government but questions are being asked of the Prime Minister's understanding, or lack thereof, around metadata after his bizarre claim that he never worried about police looking into his, when he was a journalist.

The problem with his attempt to allay fears of the modern day media is that metadata was hardly a player when Tony Abbott was reporting in the 1980s and early 90s, before the advent of the Internet.

'In the days when I was a journalist there were no metadata protections for journalists,' he stated to a gathering of reporters on Wednesday. But if you do the math, his argument simply does not stack up.

I was perfectly comfortable as a journalist, I believe that Australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner,' the Prime Minister said. His writing career ended before the internet began

While metadata does include some traditional methods of investigation; including phone numbers and length and time of calls, the overhaul's main thrust is aimed at computer based functions, particularly the online and email world.

The Internet came to be, effectively, in 1992. Full text searches were not available for two years after that and email access came to being about the same time.

By then, Tony Abbott was well and truly ensconced as press secretary to Opposition Leader Dr John Hewson, his days as a writer for The Bulletin and The Australian all but over. 

'I was perfectly comfortable as a journalist, I believe that Australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner,' the Prime Minister said.

'A contested warrant is more like a court case and if you had to have a court case to access metadata, well, the whole process would absolutely gum up,' he said.

In trying to explain the planned two-year retention, Mr Abbott has previously stated that he believed metadata to be the 'sites you're visiting'.

'It's not what you are doing on the internet, it's the site's you are visiting, it's not the content it's just where you have been.

'It's the person you are sending it to, the person sending it, it's the date and the place it's posted from.'

Federal Labor had earlier agreed to support new metadata laws with amendments.

The government bill, which is expected to pass parliament by the end of next week, forces telecommunications companies to keep two years of customer data, such as the time and length of a phone call. The laws would allow for warrant-less access by government agencies.

The government has agreed to a number of Labor amendments, including better protections for journalists.

Australian Press Council chairman David Weisbrot, has expressed his concern the laws could crush investigative journalism and dissuade whistle-blowers from coming forward.

'A healthy democratic society requires robust free speech and a free and vigorous press to hold governments and other powerful interests to account,' he said.

'I was perfectly comfortable as a journalist, I believe that Australian police and security agencies operate in a fair and reasonable and responsible manner,' the Prime Minister told the Canberra media gallery

Metadata is the footprint left by electronic communications.

The worry for journalists is that sources might be hesitant to come forward knowing that metadata could lead investigators to their door.

'These are not hypothetical concerns,' Professor Weisbrot said.

He said governments were increasingly chasing down leaks and stripping away whistle-blower protections.

'These legitimate concerns cannot be addressed effectively short of exempting journalists and media organisations.'

Attorney-General George Brandis had previously said that in a 'newly dangerous age' it was vital that those protecting Australia were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed

A parliamentary committee recommended in February the laws be passed, but called for safeguards for journalists.

It recommended the issue of protecting journalists' sources be referred to a separate inquiry to report to parliament within three months.

Attorney-General George Brandis had previously said that in a 'newly dangerous age' it was vital that those protecting Australia were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed. 

The government wants the regime legislated this month.
