The BBC has come under fire again over its attitude to drugs after a radio presenter failed to challenge artist David Hockney about his cannabis habit.

The 77-year-old told Radio 4’s Today programme that while he rarely leaves his Los Angeles home because of his deafness, he does go out to visit ‘the doctors, the bookshop and the marijuana store’.

Last night his interviewer Jim Naughtie was criticised for allowing the remark to go unchallenged.

It comes a day after Today was accused of ‘celebrating drugs culture’ in a news piece about the launch of a Bob Marley cannabis company.

Mary Brett, of campaign group Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘The BBC always seem to let this kind of thing go. Jim Naughtie should have challenged him... I was amazed he just let the comment pass.’

Hockney, whose assistant died last year after a drugs binge, has long called for cannabis, which is legal in California, to be legalised in the UK. 

He says he takes the ‘harmless and pleasant’ drug for medical reasons.

In a separate interview with the Observer this week, Hockney hinted that his cannabis use is driven by pleasure as much as need.

Revealing he holds a ‘medical marijuana patient verification card’, he said: ‘To get this you have to say, “Well, bad back, anxiety or something” and you just get it.

‘And it’s very nice actually. I don’t smoke much, but sometimes of an evening, because I don’t have alcohol any more, a bit of marijuana’s nice.’

A lifelong smoker of the drug, Hockney has long called for it to be legalised in the UK and once described it as a ‘harmless and pleasant plant’.

He told Today that he had lived his whole life ‘in Bohemia’, adding: ‘It meant you weren’t suburban’. But he complained: ‘It is the suburbs that have taken over Bohemia now and look what they’ve done. No smoking, no this, no that. They are ruining it. Absolutely ruining it.’

Last year, the painter’s 23-year-old studio assistant Dominic Elliott died from swallowing toxic toilet cleaner after a 24-hour binge on alcohol, cocaine, Ecstasy and cannabis.

His former lover John Fitzherbert was arrested over the death, but was not charged.

Soon afterwards, Hockney moved from Bridlington, east Yorkshire, back to Los Angeles, where he has lived on and off since 1964.

The artist – who wears two hearing aids - said he now spends most of his time in his secluded villa as he can no longer hear people at parties or enjoy music.

He said: ‘I work even harder I think now actually. Because I just work all the time, I don’t go out from here. I’m too deaf. If there are three or four people in the room I can’t [hear them].

‘I don’t have much social life and I don’t really mind that much actually, because I’ve got something to do here. I’m discovering things all the time still. So I’m perfectly happy here. I never leave the house.

‘At a party I’d be there but I’d not be there. I couldn’t hear anybody talking and so I just really don’t feel like going. And I’m okay here, I have plenty to do.’

Explaining what first attracted him to Los Angeles, he added: ‘The light is ten times brighter here. I remember one or two people saying to me, “Why have you come here to this cultural backwater?”

‘Well I didn’t’ see it as a cultural backwater. I said “Some of the great works of art of the 20th century were made here. Modern Times, City lights, Some Like it Hot. What do you mean cultural backwater, it’s not."'
