Digital music streaming service Spotify has declared war on Apple's iTunes - and aims to become a 'YouTube' for music.

Songs from the streaming service can be embedded easily - for free - in any website, just like YouTube videos.

It's a highly aggressive move designed to take on Apple's paid-for 'music shop' with a cheaper alternative. Spotify songs are free to try, but then users pay a subscription.

Spotify recently hit 10 million users worldwide after a partnership with Facebook which allowed web users to access Spotify via their Facebook log-in

Spotify's songs are available as streams to all users of the service, whether free or paid, and can also be downloaded to apps on iPhone, Android and PC.

Spotify 
recently hit 10 million users worldwide after a partnership with 
Facebook which allowed web users to access Spotify via their Facebook 
log-in.

The site now has 3 
million paying subscribers, paying around £10 per month to access the 
streaming service via phones and desktops.

The digital music market is currently dominated by Apple'siTunes, which offers listeners the chance to buy and keep music track by track.    

But digital music streaming companies, of which Spotify is the most successful, have begun to challenge that model by offering large libraries of music to listen to and share for a flat fee.     

Spotify has more than 10 million active users and over 3 million paying subscribers for its on-demand service, which offers unlimited streaming for free to those prepared to tolerate ads, or a premium rate of $10 a month.   

The European start-up, which is backed by digital entrepreneur and Facebook founding president Sean Parker, has grown fast in recent months since launching in the United States and sealing a partnership with Facebook.    

Parker has invested $15 million of his estimated $2 billion in the music-streaming company, which is already the number two music service in Europe after iTunes.

'If
Spotify continues growing at its current rate in terms of subscribers 
and users, we will overtake iTunes in terms of the amount of revenue we 
contribute to the music labels in under two years,' says Parker.

‘It's a really smart tactic for Spotify to get new users. It's part of their strategy of becoming the de facto standard for music on the Web,’ music analyst Mark Mulligan said.   

Spotify announced partnerships on Wednesday with web publishers including The Guardian, Vogue and The Huffington Post, and with blogging platform Tumblr.    

Spotify now has 10 million signed-up users and 2.5 million paying subscribers. CEO Daniel Ek points out that subcribers pay £120 a year, whereas customers of iTunes store only pay £60 on average

Readers who are not registered Spotify users will have to sign up to an app that will run in the background, but will not have to leave the publisher's site.   

‘YouTube got to where it is today because people are able to embed YouTube videos easily in any website,’ Giles Cottle, principal analyst at research firm Informa Telecoms & Media, wrote in a note.   

‘Any web developer will tell you that, in an online world, you have to offer and bring content to people where they want to be, not make them come to where you are.’
