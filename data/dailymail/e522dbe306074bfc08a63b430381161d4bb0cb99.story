Kevin Liverpool is alleged to have wrote his thoughts about Joss Stone, pictured leaving Exeter Crown Court on Tuesday, in a diary

One of the men accused of plotting to decapitate Joss Stone kept a list of potential targets in a diary – including Beyoncé and Girls Aloud, a court heard yesterday.

Kevin Liverpool, 35, is said to have written down his alleged  violent plan in a notebook.

Other stars mentioned in the scrawled pages are rapper Dizzee Rascal, Eminem, Craig David, R Kelly and Chris Brown, the jury was told.

The court heard there were numerous urban slang words, such as ‘wet’ – meaning to stab someone until their clothes are soaked with blood – and ‘popo’ - short for police.

One entry was said to read: ‘God doesn’t give a f***. Protect yourself from this. Remember Jocelyn Stone.

'God let her take the p***.’ Other notes mentioned the need to buy a semi-automatic gun, a gun holder, a silencer and infra-red equipment, as well as a ‘ninja sword’, it was said.

Liverpool had also written a reminder to buy a hooded top, car insurance, a safe and open a bank account, the court was told.

Liverpool and co-accused Junior Bradshaw, 32, are charged with plotting to rob and kill Miss Stone before dumping her body in a river in June 2011.

The defendants, both of St Stephen’s Close, Manchester, deny charges of conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to cause GBH and conspiracy to rob.

The diary was seized by police when they raided Liverpool’s one-bedroom flat in Longsight, Manchester, after he had been arrested in Devon.

In the diary - a daily 2007 edition - each page was covered in handwritten scrawl, in either blue or black ink, with much of it crossed or scribbled out, the court was told.

Detective Constable Katherine Joyner took the jury of 10 men and two women through the diary.

In the diary other musical stars were 
listed, such as British rapper Dizzee Rascal, Eminem, Beyonce, Craig 
David, R Kelly, Chris Brown and Girls Aloud.

The
notes included details of Miss Stone’s date and place of birth and a 
biography of her musical career, including the albums she has released.

The court heard that when Liverpool was arrested a handwritten note was found by police which said: 'Find a river to dump her.'

The jury was told there were AA route finder directions from Manchester to Miss Stone's house in Devon.

Det
Con Joyner confirmed under cross-examination from Philip King QC, 
representing Liverpool, that following her detailed examination of all 
the documents seized by police she never found a picture of Miss Stone 
or a ransom note.

The trial continues.
