A West Texas man convicted of killing two people as a teenager in 1993 was released on bond Tuesday while he awaits a new trial ordered by the state.

After spending nearly 20 years in prison for the killings of two teenagers in a drive-by shooting, Daniel Villegas stood in the morning sun outside the El Paso County Jail.

'I never thought this day would come and now it's here. It feels like a dream, like I'm going to wake up,' the 37-year-old told a crowd of reporters and sympathizers.

Ready for new life: Daniel Villegas was 16 years old when he confessed to the 1993 drive-by shooting murders of two teens in El Paso. In 1995, he was sentenced to life in prison. Now, he's free

Overcome with emotion: Flanked by his legal team, Villegas had a bond hearing, at which he's was set free, since his case was vacated last month

Free at last: Bond for 37-year-old Daniel Villegas was set at $50,000 during a court hearing Tuesday. Here he is congratulated by his lawyer, Joseph Spencer

Villegas was flanked by his mother, Yolanda Villegas, and local businessman John Mimbela, who has supported his case. Villegas was released Tuesday after posting $1,000 of a $50,000 bond.

'This is too much for me. I get to hold him again. I've waited too long,' Yolanda Villegas said while tears rolled down her cheeks.

Daniel Villegas first trial for the deaths of teenagers Armando Lazo and Robert England ended in a hung jury. He was found guilty in 1995 and sentenced to life in prison.

But at hearings in 2011, Villegas' attorney, John Gates, said he hadn't had enough time to prepare for the second trial. The defense for the first trial had called 18 witnesses; Gates presented just one.

The Texas Court of Appeals in December granted Villegas a new trial due to ineffective counsel.

Villegas has claimed he confessed to the crime after an El Paso Police Department detective told him he would be raped in prison and face the death penalty.

A private investigator hired by his supporters, a team from Northwestern University Law School's Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth and a pair of men exonerated after serving time for murder have backed up his claims of innocence.

Twenty years lost: Villegas' conviction was based almost entirely on his one-page, dictated confession, which did not match the facts of the case in numerous ways

Happy days: Cheers erupted from the public gallery as Daniel received the news that he was to be set free

Bad reputation: Villegas was a 16-year-old high school dropout with ties to a gang when he signed a confession admitting to the murders

Most importantly, Jesse Hernandez, who survived the 1993 shooting, said that Villegas is not the killer.

‘I believe with all my heart he is innocent,’ Hernandez told FoxNews.com. ‘I always thought I knew who else might have done it from the beginning. I had never heard of Daniel before.’

'Why did it take so long to get a new 
trial? Money, I didn't have the money,' his mother said. She thanked 
Mimbela for footing the legal bills and 'for putting up with me, I can 
be annoying.'

The Villegas 
lost their house because of the debt they took during the first trial, 
she added. 'I earn minimum wage. I didn't have the $20,000 to begin (the
 process of getting a new trial), and even if I did, that was just to 
start,' Villegas' mother said.

The Texas Court of Appeals in December granted Villegas a new trial due to ineffective counsel.

State District Judge Sam Medrano Jr. set a hearing for next week so the attorneys can tell them what they plan to do next.

Villegas' attorney, Joe Spencer said he believes the prosecution 'has no evidence to go on with this case.'

The
 judge set bond at half of what Spencer had originally suggested. 
Prosecutors requested bond be set in the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars.

The district attorney's office declined to comment after the hearing.

Villegas left jail in a 1960s red convertible provided by Mimbela.

'We're going to go to church real quick, to pray,' Villegas said.

Then, 'it's steak, steak and lobster for my baby,' his mom said.

Grave allegations: Villegas has claimed that a detective obtained his confession by force after hitting and threatening him

For Villegas, the chain of events that landed him behind bars goes back to 1993 when four men, including Hernandez, Juan Carlos Medina and murder victims Armando ‘Mando’ Lazo, 18, and Robert England, 17, were walking along Electric Avenue in El Paso, Texas.

A car with three people inside pulled up, and one passenger demanded ‘Que Barrio?’ – a slang term which means ‘what gang are you with?’ In response, two of the men ran away, and two others were shot dead in a vacant lot.

England suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and died on scene. Lazo was shot once in the abdomen and once in the thigh. His body was found outside a nearby home where he had desperately tried to seek help.

Soon after, police investigating the murders focused on Villegas as a suspect. The 16-year-old boy was a high school dropout and a known gang member who had a reputation for telling tall tales in an effort to boost his street cred.

Crime scene: Villegas was arrested in 1993 after two men were gunned down in El Paso in what appears to be a gang-related shooting

The teen was arrested in connection with the deadly shootings, and just hours later police got a confession penned in a third-grade level of writing. In the document, Villegas noted that a detective offered him a Coke, and he apologized to the families of the victims.

According to Villegas’ team, then-detective Al Marquez used physical violence and threatened the frightened teen into signing the confession, which proved crucial during the trial since investigators had no evidence linking the 16-year-old to the scene of the crime.

'I'm not a saint, but even thought I'm not, you know, I'm not a killer either,' Villegas said in an interview with News Channel 9 in November 2011.

The story of a forced confession rang true for Hernandez, who was also questioned following the murders.

‘They tried to do that to me, but I kind of put things together,’ he told Fox News. ‘They pushed him. They had other leads but they just dropped the ball and wanted the easy way out.’

Team effort: Villegas' supporters claim that he had inadequate legal representation during his trial and is innocent

Villegas’ first trial ended in hung jury, but in a second trial that took place in 1995, the panel came back with a guilty verdict, and he was sentenced to life in prison.

Freddie Bonilla, the private detective who was hired by Villegas’ distant relative, has revealed that court-appointed attorney John Gates failed in his duties as a counselor, spending only 40 hours preparing for his client’s murder trial.

Gates even signed an affidavit admitting that he had not done his best to argue Villegas' case.

Family support: Villegas' parents have been fighting to get a retrial for their son where he would have a chance to prove his innocence

Joshua Tepfer, project director at the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth, told FoxNews.com evidence shows the murders were committed by brothers Rudy and Javier Flores, who allegedly told a witness Villegas was in jail for a crime they did.

Javier Flores has since died and his surviving sibling is currently serving jail time on drug-related charges.
