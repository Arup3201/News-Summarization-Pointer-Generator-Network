A salesman from the firm behind last year's devastating outbreak of meningitis has revealed how the lab made up prescriptions for fake customers in order to maximise its profits.

New England Compounding Center, where the fungal disease which has killed 48 originated, was only supposed to manufacture drugs for individuals as it was not regulated by federal officials.

To get round the ban on large-scale production, clinics requested prescriptions with invented names such as 'Bill Smith', 'Jane Doe' and even 'Homer Simpson'.

Another worker claims he warned his boss that 'something's going to happen' just a month before the first of the firm's patients died from meningitis, but was totally ignored.

NECC, based in the suburbs of Boston, provided a steroid which turned out to be contaminated to dozens of clinics around the U.S.

Nearly 50 people have died and more than 700 were hospitalised after they contracted fungal meningitis from being injected with the steroid, which was supposed to control back pain.

All those affected had been treated with drugs from NECC, which was not regulated by the FDA as it was only licenced to compound drugs for specific individuals on receipt of a prescription.

But a salesman for the firm told CBS's 60 Minutes that the company was in fact acting as a drug manufacturer, and claimed that it had as many as 3,000 clients despite presenting itself as a 'mom and pop specialty pharmacy'.

In order to circumvent the ban on large-scale manufacture, clinics would allegedly submit prescriptions under fake names and pretend these were their patients.

'Bart Simpson, Homer Simpson - those ones did raise red flags, and we would call our client back, and say, "Hey, give us different names,"' the unnamed salesman said. 'The follow-up names would be like a John Doe, Jane Doe, Bill Doe - you know, Jane Smith, Bill Smith.'

When NECC staff continued to object, he said, 'Sometimes [clients] would take a phone directory within their office, and scribble out their extensions, and fax it over to us.'

He added that the company employed 30 sales representatives, but claimed that when inspectors visited its headquarters the sales team was told to stay away so as not to raise suspicions.

Joe Connolly, a former technician at Clean Room One where much of the contaminated material was made up, said that a year before the meningitis outbreak the firm started to increase its output by up to 1,000 times.

'We became a manufacturer overnight,' he told 60 Minutes. 'So we were basically trying to have the best of both worlds. It was trying to manufacture without the oversight of a manufacturer.'

He said that technicians had found mould in the laboratory around a dozen times in the three years leading up to the start of the scandal.

According to Mr Connolly, late last summer he approached his supervisor and said: 'Something's going to happen. Something's going to get missed. And we're going to get shut down.'

He apparently expressed concerns the lab's products would 'hurt a patient' - but his worries were ignored by management.

In September, patients who had been treated with methylprednisolone acetate originating from NECC began to fall ill with meningitis.

The firm was rapidly shut down by the FCC, and has now gone out of business.

Owner Barry Cadden has refused to comment on the allegations made by 60 Minutes, and invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying to Congress.
