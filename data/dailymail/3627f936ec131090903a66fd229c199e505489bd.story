In a heartbreaking love letter written to mark their 13th wedding anniversary, the wife of real-life American Sniper Chris Kyle has described the moment her future husband gave her two dozen roses during one of their first dates.

Taya Kyle pledged to love her late husband 'all the days of my life' in the touching tribute posted on social media two days ago.

Kyle, who was the subject of last year's Clint Eastwood-directed movie American Sniper, was gunned down by fellow war veteran Eddie Ray Routh at a shooting range in Rough Creek, Texas, on February 2, 2013.

That day, Kyle had offered to help Routh deal with his post traumatic stress disorder but was instead shot dead along with his friend Chad Littlefield.

Now, in the wake of a turbulent year that involved her husband's killer's trial and an appearance at the Academy Awards for the film made in his name, Mrs Kyle has written of her enduring love for her husband.

Posted on Facebook, her letter said: 'I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life.

'Today, I am thinking of our new relationship, when you rented a boutique hotel room in San Diego and surprised me with two dozen long stem pink roses when we arrived. You got us tickets to a local improv type play. I knew then I was the luckiest girl in the world to be with tough, romantic, loving you.

'Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you. Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty.

'I am somewhere in between today. I loved you yesterday, I love you know, and I will love you all the days of my life.'

Kyle was considered the deadliest sniper in American history, with his kill count thought to number about 160 confirmed, with many more probable kills.

Routh was convicted on February 28 of double murder and as prosecutors decided not to pursue the death penalty, the only possible sentence was life in prison - with no chance of parole.

The verdict, which took little more than two hours for jurors to reach, came as interest in Kyle's career as the U.S. military's deadliest-ever sniper reached fever pitch.

Kyle's exploits in the Iraqi desert were showcased to tens of millions of Americans just days before, when American Sniper, the movie based on his bestselling autobiography, featured at the Oscars, where it was nominated for six awards.

'Hey babe,

'It's 13 years today. Our wedding anniversary. I miss you and I love you. I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life.

'Today, I am thinking of our new relationship, when you rented a boutique hotel room in San Diego and surprised me with 2 dozen long stem pink roses when we arrived. You got us tickets to a local improv type play. I knew then I was the luckiest girl in the world to be with tough, romantic, loving you.

'I am thinking of the way you loved to blow the budget on gifts for me with that huge smile on your face and eyes lit up... so much so that my heart would leap out of my chest as I was simultaneously shocked and delighted even when I had no idea how we would afford it. I'm sorry I sometimes voiced my concern about the price.

'I am also thinking of how grateful I finally learned how to not balk at the money spent on your generous gifts. I am thinking of November 2012 when you sent me a dozen long stem red roses with a card that said "just because" and how you had them delivered even though we were home together that day. You just wanted to surprise me. You did and it made my day like you made so many others.

'Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you. Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty. I am somewhere in between today.

'And if I didn't tell you enough in life, then let me tell you today... YOU Chris Kyle, are IT for me. YOU are the package deal who makes hanging on worth it.

'I loved you yesterday, I love you now, and I will love you all the days of my life.

'Thank you for marrying me, even if I'm the one who had to ask you.'
