The left wing mayor of New York City will be the star speaker at next week’s Labour Party conference in Manchester.

Bill de Blasio last year became the city’s first Democratic mayor since 1993 – winning on a radical campaign to tax the rich and introduce a mass house building programme.

He campaigned on the slogan ‘One New York, Rising Together’ – reminiscent of Ed Miliband’s ‘On Nation’ Labour.

Mr De Blasio has been held up by Labour insiders as proof that left-wing leaders can win without adopting Tony Blair-style centrist policies.

He will speak about the urgent need to tackle income inequality around the world – while also holding private talks with Mr Miliband.

Mr De Blasio isn't the first New York mayor to speak at a UK party conference.

In 2007, his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, addressed the Tories in Blackpool.

His role as ‘international speaker’ at the Labour conference will see him follow in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela and Bill Clinton.

Mr de Blasio has been been dubbed by his critics as ‘as red as Ken Livingstone’.

The Tories will highlight Mr De Blasio’s support for higher taxes and US claims that he is ‘anti-business’.

Ed Miliband said Mr De Blasio was helping 'everyday New Yorkers' share the success of the city 

In his inaugural speech, the Mayor said: ‘We are called to put an end to economic and social inequalities.’

Mr De Blasio won a landslide victory in 2013 to become the first Democratic mayor of New York for 20 years.

The Mayor said: ‘The fight against income inequality doesn’t stop at a city limit, a state line or an international border.

‘It’s an issue that confronts us all, in every corner of the world, and it demands a unified response.

‘To truly lift up more people, families and communities struggling to make it in tough economic conditions, we must truly have a shared vision, and a shared strategy.’

Mr Miliband said: ‘There have always been close links between the Labour Party and leading Democrats.

‘But I am particularly pleased that Bill de Blasio has agreed to speak at our pre-election conference this year. I followed his election campaign closely and I have been impressed by the work he has done since taking office in January for everyday New Yorkers so they can begin to share in, as well as create, a successful future for their great city.’

The Labour leader added: ‘We both recognise we face a generational challenge to ensure that hard work is properly rewarded, that young people get a fair shot in life, and that the cost-of-living crisis for working families is tackled.

‘It is an international challenge for progressive leaders in the United Kingdom, in the United States, and across the developed world.’
