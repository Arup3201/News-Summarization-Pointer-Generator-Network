Police have apologised to the 
family of a nurse who was murdered by her estranged husband weeks after 
she complained he was harassing her.

Kate Mott, 35, had obtained a court order against husband Brent, 32, a month before he strangled her in January 2010.

But 'errors' in the way Merseyside 
Police processed the paperwork led to one of her calls to police being 
handled wrongly, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said.

The watchdog launched an investigation into the matter shortly after Mott, also a nurse, was convicted of his wife’s murder in August 2010.

He was jailed for a minimum of 25 years after Liverpool Crown Court heard he strangled the mother of his two children at their home in Everard Road, Southport, then tried to make her death look like the result of a car crash.

He also raped her at or around the time of the killing, the court heard.

IPCC Commissioner Naseem Malik said: 'The murder of Kate Mott was a terrible tragedy.

'She was trying to escape an oppressive and abusive relationship.

'She had taken the appropriate legal steps to protect herself, but when she turned to Merseyside Police for assistance she clearly did not receive the level of service she was entitled to.'

Police call centre workers and officers failed to grasp the seriousness of the injunction - a non-molestation order - and Mrs Mott’s complaint was treated as a case of 'adults quarrelling over divorce proceedings', the watchdog said.

A police officer told Mrs Mott it would be difficult for the force to act and advised her to contact her solicitor rather than the police.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy 
Williams, of Merseyside Police, said: 'I would like to take this 
opportunity to express our sympathy to the family of Kate Mott for their
terrible loss. Our thoughts remain with them.

'Due to our concerns about the circumstances surrounding Kate's death we referred the matter to the IPCC. An immediate review of our 
management of non-molestation orders and domestic abuse policy training 
was conducted following the death of Mrs Mott in 2010.

'As a result of this review, 
Merseyside Police put in place a number of improvements to strengthen 
our management of these orders across the force and specifically within 
the force contact centre in which this issue arose.

'The IPCC report recognises that the 
force has acknowledged failings in this case and as a consequence has 
made a recommendation for the force to improve the reinforcement of 
domestic abuse policy and procedures with officers and staff.

'However, it is clear that, in this 
case, the processes and training we had in place at that time fell short
of the required standard. We are now confident that the changes we have
put in place has led to a greater understanding of non-molestation 
orders.

'We continually review our policies, 
processes and the training given to staff to ensure that they are able 
to correctly assess the risk posed by individuals. We work with partner 
agencies to put appropriate management plans in place for specific 
people, which allow us to effectively protect the public.'

He did not clarify the name of her husband or add his name to the incident log. He also failed to make any checks about Brent Mott on the Police National Computer.

Mrs Mott later said in a letter to her solicitor she 'was extremely disappointed and let down after this call', the IPCC said in its report.

'In our opinion there were failings at each stage of the contact and in particular the way the police officer handled the call with Mrs Mott raises significant concerns,' Ms Malik added.

'While his actions have not reached the level which amounts to misconduct, it is clear his performance fell substantially below what should have been expected.

'He was dealing with a concerned, vulnerable woman but he dismissed her concerns as a case of bickering adults and gave totally inappropriate advice.

'I believed that the failings were of such concern that it warranted an apology to the family of Kate Mott.

'I am pleased that Merseyside Police acknowledged the failing and a senior officer delivered an apology in a face-to-face meeting with Mrs Mott’s family.

'While this may only be a small piece of comfort for Mrs Mott's family, I believe it is an important step for police forces to acknowledge and apologise for errors.

'Although sorry is a small word, it can have a powerful impact.'

The IPCC probe was launched following a voluntary referral from Merseyside Police.

Ms Malik added: 'Merseyside Police have appropriate policies in place to deal with incidents such as this, and it is hoped the Kate Mott's experience is an isolated case.

'However it was of concern that the officer who mishandled Mrs Mott's call so badly had neither been trained in, nor acquainted himself with, these policies.

'Merseyside Police have put in place a comprehensive action plan for the officer to help him learn from his errors and we recommended the force reinforced its domestic abuse polices with all its officers and staff.'

In a statement, Merseyside Police confirmed that an 'extensive' review of the Force's domestic abuse policy and procedure was carried out after the death of Mrs Mott.

Following this, the force said, it has made a number of changes to strengthen the processing of non-molestation orders and reminded officers and staff of its domestic abuse policy
