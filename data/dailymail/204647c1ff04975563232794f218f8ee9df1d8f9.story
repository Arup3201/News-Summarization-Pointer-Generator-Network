Two men have been arrested after allegedly using an application on their phone to mimic a police car.

Michael Railly, 28, and Joshua Robert Sossamon were stopped in Oklahoma City by undercover officers on Wednesday.

The policemen say they watched as the pair used an app on their mobile to impersonate a police car and tried pull over a motorcyclist.

Railly, who was driving, was charged with impersonating a police vehicle, assault and battery of a police officer, driving under the influence of alcohol, speeding and having no state driver's license, according to reports on NewsOK.

Speaking to Koco News, Sergeant Gary Knight, of Oklahoma City Police Department, said: 'In this day and age there are so many ways people can skirt the law, and there are so many things that cellphones are capable of now, that it really doesn't suprise me to see it.'

While it is not illegal to own one of the many police siren apps, it is illegal to use them to impersonate a police car.

Police say an app like this one was used. Though illegal to download, it is illegal to use one to imitate police

Oklahoma state law prohibits the use of red and blue lights at the front of a vehicle by anything other than law enforcement or wrecker services.

However Sossamon, who was riding in the passenger seat, has defended their actions and accused the arresting officers of using excessive force.

He said: 'I remember there being a motorcycle that was turning left in front of us. Apparently, he supposedly had the app on at that time. We weren't trying to pull anyone over. That's absurd.'

'They very forcefully pulled him from the car. Keep in 
mind he is handcuffed. They threw him to the ground in front of me.

'They
hog-tied him, and then, because he was still being belligerent, they 
sprayed him in the face while he was hog-tied, because he was still 
speaking.

'They sprayed him in the face with Mace, and then threw him 
back in the car.'

The officers claim that Railly was thrashing about in the police car following his arrest when he kicked one of the policemen who asked him to calm down, before placing him in restraints.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
