A minute's applause will take place before the game between Scotland and England in memory of the supporter who died at Celtic Park after falling down a stairwell.

Scotland fan Nathan McSeveney was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary after he fell as he was leaving following Scotland's 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win over the Republic of Ireland on Friday.

The 20-year-old is thought to have plunged three floors down as he was leaving the home of reigning Scottish champions Celtic.

'The Scottish FA intends to pay its own respects and we believe it is fitting that Nathan's fellow Scotland supporters have an opportunity to pay tribute to one of their own at Celtic Park.'

Police confirmed there were 'no suspicious circumstances' into the death of Rangers fan Nathan, who was one of 55,000 supporters at Celtic Park on Friday night.
