Police searching for the killer of a frail pensioner battered to 
death in a hammer attack have mounted a nationwide hunt for a rapist 
with a history of violence.

Graeme Jarman, 47, disappeared from his home two days before 77-year-old Judith Richardson was found murdered in her hall.

Police believe he has changed his appearance by shaving off his hair, and warned members of the public not to approach him.

Jarman, a former civil servant, is a registered sex offender who was 
released early from two previous prison sentences — the first one for a 
rape attack.

Miss Richardson was bludgeoned to death on August 19 during a vicious
assault at her flat in the Northumberland market town of Hexham.

Police believe her attacker stole her handbag and dumped it 25 miles 
away in a bin outside a charity shop in Newcastle city centre.

It was 
handed in to police, and officers went to Miss Richardson’s home to 
return the lost property. There they found her body.

Last night, police confirmed that Jarman was a murder suspect  and appealed for him to hand himself in.

He is believed to have left his home in Consett, County Durham, on August 17.

Durham Constabulary, who were monitoring the sex offender, notified 
other forces that he was missing on August 23 after he failed to appear 
in court to answer a shoplifting charge.

His details have now been circulated throughout the UK.

Jarman is described as a heavily built man of average height, clean 
shaven with normally dark hair. He was last seen wearing blue jeans, a 
light blue polo shirt with dark  cuffs and collar and was carrying a 
dark jacket.

On the morning of her death Miss Richardson, who lived alone with her
West Highland terrier, Hamish, is thought to have driven the half-mile 
from her home in St Wilfrid’s Road to shop at Tesco and Aldi in Hexham.

She drove back and at some point during the day she was attacked and killed.

The hammer police say was used to kill her was found in an Aldi carrier bag during searches on St Wilfrid’s Road.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Young, who is leading the 
investigation, said: ‘We have information which suggests that Mr Jarman 
might be able to assist with this investigation and we would like to 
speak to him without delay.

‘We advise people not to approach him but anyone who sees him or believes they know where he is should contact us immediately.

‘There is no doubt this man is a serious, violent offender who remains a danger to the public as long as he is at large.

‘He may re-offend and that is why we are appealing to the public to inform us if they see him, and not to approach him.

‘We believe he is at large and is  a danger.’

Anyone with information should call Northumbria Police on 0191 375 2176 or 03456 043 043.
