Besotted: Sadie Johnson, 36, systematically plundered £45,600 from a charity he helped run, a court heard

A lovesick secretary who stole more than £45,000 from a charity to splash on a man she met online broke down and wept as she was jailed for 12 months.

Sadie Johnson, 36, was a personal assistant to orthopaedic consultant Peter Hallam at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

But the besotted crook systematically plundered £45,600 from a charity he helped run, a court heard.

Mr Hallam was also secretary of the East Anglian Orthopaedic Club, which is not connected with the NNUH but helps promote training and courses for doctors.

Johnson began siphoning off cash from it over a four-year period, Norwich Crown Court was told.

She was caught after she went off long-term sick and Mr Hallam got her replacement to check the account in January this year over an unpaid invoice.

The shocked expert found there was only £124 left and the charity was 'almost bust'.

Chris Youell, prosecuting, said: 'He was somewhat surprised and shocked as he expected it to have substantially more.'

Mr Youell said Johnson had written out cheques to herself and forged Mr Hallam's signature.

He said there were 93 transactions amounting to £45,600. Mr Youell said the PA admitted her crimes.

Johnson, who cried in the dock, accepted she had lived beyond her means and spent money on a man she met on the internet.

Mr Youell said: 'She said she had no idea how much she had taken.'

Johnson, of Bowthorpe, Norwich, admitted theft from her employer and was jailed for 12 months. Judge Anthony Bate told her she had breached the trust placed in her.

The judge said: 'People in your kind of job have to be trusted by doctors, patients and colleagues.'

He said that as a consultant surgeon Mr Hallam was busy looking after his patients.

'They don't have the time to devote to routine paperwork,' added Judge Bate. 'They trust their secretaries and personal assistants.'

The judge said she had started stealing after coming under the 'malign influence' of a man she met.

Judge Bate said that while it explained her actions, it did not excuse them.

'You brought this whole shame on yourself and you must now pay the penalty for it,' he told her.

Stephen Spence, defending, said: 'It was inevitably going to lead back to her. She had been living beyond her means and was spending some of the money on herself.'

But he said she was also 'na've' and after meeting a man online was manipulated by him into taking the money and she had been 'milked' of cash.

'She is a rather broken young woman but who has a lot of her life ahead of her,' said Mr Spence.
