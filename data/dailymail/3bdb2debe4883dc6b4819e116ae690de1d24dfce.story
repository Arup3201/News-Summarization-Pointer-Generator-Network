Ticket inspectors who spear tackled a 15-year-old girl after she tried to avoid paying her $2.50 train fare have been slammed for using 'excessive force'.

Victorian Ombudsman Deborah Glass wrote in her report of the July 2013 incident that the inspectors' actions breached Victoria's Charter of Human Rights.

CCTV footage of the Flinders Street Railway Station incident, which became public last year after Victorian Greens leader Greg Barber obtained it through a freedom of information request, shows the girl attempting to avoid the ticket machines by running through a side gate where she was intercepted by an inspector.

CCTV footage taken at Flinders Street Railway Station in July 2013 showed a Melbourne ticket inspector spear tackle a 15-year-old girl for evading her train fare

The teen appeared to hit the inspector in the face before she was lifted into the air and thrown down to the ground on her back.

She was then held down by three men for more than eight minutes until police arrived at the scene.

'(He) picked me up and he threw me on the ground and virtually nearly broke my back,' the girl said, according to the report.

'I couldn't breathe. I couldn't move. I was screaming.'

The incident left her with back problems and requiring ongoing counselling, according to the ABC.

Ms Glass' report found excessive force was used by one inspector, and the girl's human rights were 'degraded'.

It revealed ticket inspectors only received half a day of practical training in how to use force and recommended that Public Transport Victoria take over recruitment and training them, which the organisation subsequently agreed to do.

Two of the officers involved said they picked up restraint techniques on an ad hoc basis.

'It is disappointing that the use of force by authorised officers continues to be an issue despite two previous investigations and repeated recommendations,' the report said.

Her critical report came after two internal reviews of the incident, which didn't include interviews with the teenager involved nor any independent witnesses, found the inspectors had done nothing wrong.

The outcome was slammed by Victorian Transport Minister Jacinta Allan.

Greens leader Greg Barber said ticket inspectors should sell tickets or become regular station staff.

'They have already been given the equipment to take payments for fines on public transport, so should be able to help people buy tickets,' Mr Barber said.
