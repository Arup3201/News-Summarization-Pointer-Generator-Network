Former Business Secretary Lord Mandelson defended Tony Blair against criticism over Iraq, insisting it was a 'mistake honestly made'

The Iraq war was a ‘mistake honestly made’, Lord Mandelson claimed last night as he leapt to the defence of his old friend Tony Blair.

The former Labour Cabinet minister insisted Mr Blair had not ‘gone a bit nuts’ for calling for new military action and did not take the ‘country to war on a lie’.

Lord Mandelson said he was not going to ‘join Tony Blair's chorus of critics’, after the former Prime Minister came under fire in recent days for claiming the latest unrest in Iraq was unconnected to the 2003 invasion.

Mr Blair has come under fire from across the political spectrum for his call for new military intervention in Iraq.

His former deputy Lord Prescott accused him of behaving like the ‘crusades’ while London Mayor Boris Johnson said the former Premier ‘needs professional psychiatric help’.

Islamist jihadists are now in control of large areas of the Iraq, plunging the country into its bloodiest crisis since the withdrawal of US troops in 2011.

ISIS rebels, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are threatening to topple the government, with David Cameron warning the group would attempt terror strikes against Britain.

But Mr Blair this week claimed Iraq would have been 'engulfed by precisely the same convulsion' if Saddam Hussein had remained in power, as he called for new military intervention.

The remarks reignited the bitter row about the basis of his decision to follow George W Bush into the war.

Lord Mandelson, a former New Labour spin doctor, refused to criticise the decision to go to war.

He told BBC 2’s Newsnight: ‘I think that on reflection you could judge that it was a mistake, but this is the crucial point I would make to you: if it was a mistake, it was a mistake honestly made.

‘I do not believe that either Tony Blair or the government as a whole - as some people claim - took the country to war on a lie. I think that's unacceptable. I don't think it's true.’

He also denied Mr Blair had gone too far in defending the 2003 war, and the bloodshed which followed after Saddam Hussein was ousted.

Lord Mandelson added: ‘I do not think he's gone a bit nuts and I think he is fully entitled to defend his position.

‘I also happen to think he's right to say that whereas 25 years ago... we had the relative certainties of the Cold War to deal with, we now have the terrible uncertainties of jihadism, of radical Islam.

‘He is right to point out the dangers of that and he's right to galvinise people and mobilise people to take the action, to adopt the policies to deal with it.’

However, not all of Mr Blair's former Cabinet colleagues have been so supportive.

His former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw insisted the rise of jihadist extremism in Iraq is linked to the 2003 invasion.

He said it was 'impossible' to argue that the war ordered by Mr Blair 'played no part at all in today's events'.

It put him at odds with Mr Blair who claimed Iraq would have been 'engulfed by precisely the same convulsion' if Saddam Hussein had remained in power, as he called for new military intervention. 

Lord Prescott, who served as Deputy Prime Minister at the time of the war, accused Mr Blair of trying to take the West 'back to the crusades'.

'He says he's disappointed with what has happened in Iraq... but he wants to invade somewhere else now,' he told Sky News. 'Your great danger, when you want to go and do these regime changes, you're back to what Bush called a crusade... put on a white sheet and a red cross, and we're back to the crusades.'

Clare Short, who also served in Mr Blair's Cabinet during the war, said he had been 'absolutely, consistently wrong, wrong, wrong' on the issue, and branded him a 'complete American neocon'.

'More bombing will not solve it, it will just exacerbate it,' she said.
