Patients will be hit with a new $20 fee to see their doctor when changes to Medicare are implemented next week, with some doctors warning it could destroy free universal healthcare.

The changes, introduced by the Abbott government to cut costs, will see Medicare pay $20.10 less for consultations under 10 minutes from January 19, Fairfax Media reports.

These short visits lasting from six to 10 minutes are referred to as Level B consultations and can include patients after new prescriptions for regular medication.

Medicare has paid $37.05 towards these visits for years but will now pay $16.95.

The changes, introduced by the Abbott government to cut costs, will see Medicare pay $20.10 less for consultations under 10 minutes from January 19

The change may prompt doctors to stop bulk billing these shorter consultations and start charging patients to cover costs.

Medicare has paid a $37.05 rebate for a GP consultation under 10 minutes.

This will change to $16.95 from January 19.

Doctors will absorb the cost if they bulk-bill.

If they don't bulk-bill, patients will receive a $16.95 rebate. This will change the out of pocket amount depending on what doctors charge.

It comes alongside the $5 cut to Medicare rebates for non-concessional patients from July. People without a concession who see a doctor for under 10 minutes will receive an $11.95 rebate.

A further $5 cut to GP rebates comes in from July 1, on top of a near-six year freeze on Medicare rebate indexation. 

While the Abbott government scrapped its plan for a $7 Medicare co-payment before Christmas, Australian Medical Association's vice president, Dr Stephen Parnis, said new changes were 'wrecking balls' that would effect the way general practice and medicine is conducted in Australia.

'They dumped the $7 co-payment fee and introduced three big changes that were a bit different,' he told the Today show. 

'One was a cut in the nature of level A or level B payments, the $5 co-payment instead of $7 coming from July and a freeze on Medicare rebates until 2018.'

Dr Parnis said the shift in costs would have a profound impact on the way GPs do their work. 

'I think it's going to be devastating because it will discourage people from going to the doctor,' he said.

Dr Parnis said doctors were unlikely to absorb the change in cost and it's likely it will passed on to patients

'They'll present later with more serious problems - it also means they might go to other parts of the health system such as hospital emergency departments.'

Dr Parnis said doctors were unlikely to absorb the change in cost.

'Well if you're taking a cut of more than 55 percent with more to come in July, how can you possibly run a business? This is going to have a huge impact on access to care,' he said. 

'There is nothing good about this.'

The government says doctors who want to charge for a standard GP consultation will now need to spend at least 10 minutes with a patient to attract the standard Level B consultation rebate.

The Australian Medical Association fears this will blow out GP waiting times.

A spokesman for Health Minister Sussan Ley told Fairfax Media the changes to GP visits less than 10 minutes were designed to encourage longer consultations.

'Under the current rules, a GP can access Medicare rebates for up to 20 minutes, even if their patient is in and out the door in six minutes,' he said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the government would ditch plans for the controversial $7 Medicare co-payment in December.

Instead, an optional co-payment would be introduced at the same time the Medicare rebate to GPs is reduced by $5. It will be up to doctors to decide whether their patients make up the difference or bulk bill them. 

Incentives to bulk bill children under 16, concession card holders, pensioners and veterans will remain in place. The new measures will come into place from July.

The latest change in GP costs comes alongside the $5 cut to Medicare rebates for consultations for non-concessional patients from July. People without a concession who see a doctor for under 10 minutes will receive an $11.95 rebate.
