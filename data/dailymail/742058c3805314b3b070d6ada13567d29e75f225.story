Police are investigating the death of a man who died on a dive off the Suffolk Coast.

The alarm was raised yesterday afternoon by the crew of the dive boat in the North Sea, which was thought to have seven people on board.

Police met the boat, which had set out with seven people on board, at Hamilton Docks near Lowestoft.

'Recreational': Police were called to a dive boat on a trip off the Suffolk coast

One man was airlifted from the sea to the James Paget Hospital at Gorleston where he was declared dead.

A second diver was taken to hospital by ambulance, but police say he is likely to be discharged tonight.

Suffolk police say they are making inquiries into what happened as reports suggest the men may have become trapped underwater.

A police spokesman said: 'This was a recreational trip, rather than an industrial dive, that had set off from the town this morning.

'The diver that died is not thought to be local and, as is standard procedure, his death is currently being treated as unexplained.

'Police have been working with the coastguard and liaising with the Health & Safety Executive and an investigation is underway.'
