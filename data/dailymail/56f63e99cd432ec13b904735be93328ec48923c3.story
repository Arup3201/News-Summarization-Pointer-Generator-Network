She hasn’t been welcomed into the firm just yet. But if ever there was a sign that Cressida Bonas is inching ever closer to the royal seal of approval – and well and truly winning over Prince Harry – then this is it.

It has emerged Harry has invited his girlfriend of 18 months to shoot at the Queen’s Sandringham estate on several occasions.

Most recently he was given the run of his grandmother’s private home in Norfolk two weekends ago when he invited a group of friends, including Miss Bonas, 24.

Close: Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas on a date earlier this month, just before they spent a weekend together at Sandringham in Norfolk

Out on the town: Prince Harry was LouLou's Private Members Club in 
Mayfair watching a special performance by Buena Vista Social Club until 3am last night

The lively party enjoyed three days of countryside pursuits laid on by Harry and the Queen’s private gamekeepers and staff.

Neither the Queen nor the Duke of 
Edinburgh were present so it would be wide of the mark to say that Miss 
Bonas has received ‘the royal seal of approval’.

Indeed shooting parties are held 
frequently by Prince Charles and his sons when the Queen is not in 
residence, and the Daily Mail understands Miss Bonas has attended 
several such gatherings before.

But her presence at Sandringham earlier this month is a sign that the couple’s romance is going from strength to strength.

Sources say Harry, 29, is ‘incredibly
serious’ about her. In recent weeks the pair have been seen out on 
several dates, including to musical The Book Of Mormon, and a James 
Blunt gig, a favourite pop singer of the prince.

They also holidayed together in Botswana over the summer with a group of friends.

But the prince is also fiercely 
determined to protect Miss Bonas from the glare of publicity that being a
royal girlfriend brings. He is acutely aware that this pressure 
‘spooked’ his previous long-term love Chelsy Davy, whom he broke up with
after seven years shortly after his brother’s wedding in 2011.

A well-placed source said yesterday: 
‘Harry and his brother are given a weekend each at Sandringham when they
can ask some friends to join them.

'Nothing more to it. The two seem to 
get on well together but it is too early to say yet what the future 
holds.’

Going strong: It is now a year since the pair became boyfriend and girlfriend, having first been introduced by his cousin and her best friend, Princess Eugenie

Harry, who earlier this year returned
from a tour of duty in Afghanistan as an Apache attack helicopter 
pilot, and Miss Bonas were introduced more than a year ago by his cousin
and her best friend, Princess Eugenie.

Miss Bonas, described by friends as 
‘posh, bubbly and terribly, terribly sweet’, was photographed kissing 
Harry on the ski slopes of Verbier earlier this year.

Their continuing closeness has 
prompted rumours they are tipped to wed, although well-placed sources 
say this is ‘not on the cards – yet’.

‘Cressida is very discreet but she 
and Harry are very fond of each other and taking things one step at a 
time to see whether or not there might be something more permanent one 
day,’ one source told the Mail.

‘She is still very young, though, and has plans that I don’t believe include an engagement yet .’

In an interview with US television 
last year, Harry complained that girls appeared to be put off by his 
title. ‘I’m not so much searching for someone to fulfill the role, but 
obviously, you know, finding someone that would be willing to take it 
on,’ he said.
