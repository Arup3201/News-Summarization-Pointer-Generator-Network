A 21-year-old man was arrested today on suspicion of manslaughter after a pedestrian was killed by a lorry just moments after being involved in a dispute near a car wash.

The victim, aged 26, was struck yesterday by the HGV in Quarry Bank, West Midlands, just seconds after he was involved in an argument with a man at the Formula 1 Hand Car Wash, police said.

Eyewitnesses revealed that the man, who has not yet been named, had been fleeing an attacker wielding a hammer before being struck by the seven-ton vehicle at around 3.30pm.

Aftermath: The 26 year old was struck yesterday by the HGV in Quarry Bank, West Midlands, just seconds after he was involved in an argument with a man at the Formula 1 Hand Car Wash, police said

Paramedics were called to the scene but despite their best efforts the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

Det Sgt Jim Munro of West Midlands Police, said: ‘This collision happened at a busy time in the afternoon and I know there would have been a number of people in the area that witnessed it.

‘I’m also keen to hear from anyone who has any information about the dispute the man was involved in just before the collision.’

A neighbour who lives next door to the car wash said he saw a pick-up truck revving his engine before driving at the victim down an alleyway, which caused him to run out into the road.

The man, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I saw a man in a Ford Ranger pick-up truck chasing the man who died at about 3.20pm yesterday.

‘The Ranger chased him and I saw the man run - then I heard a loud thud. It then reversed away like a bat out of hell on the dual carriageway. He was angry, he wanted to get hold of that man.

‘As soon as I heard the thud I ran 
out, my partner ran over to the man to check his pulse but he was dead. It was a steel lorry - he had no chance, even though he was only going 
at about 30mph.’

Mother-of-two
 Samantha Bowskill, who lives nearby, said: ‘The first we knew about it 
was when we heard the sirens. We came out about 3.30pm when they were 
putting the police ribbons up.

‘I thought it wasn’t a normal accident because they were closing the whole road.’

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman added: ‘Crews arrived to find a pedestrian in a collision with a lorry.

‘Despite the efforts of ambulance staff at the scene, it quickly became apparent that nothing could be done to save the man and he was confirmed dead at the scene.’

The busy dual carriageway was closed for more than four hours in both directions while police carried out investigations.

Another local resident, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘Apparently there was one bloke running after another man with a hammer in his hand.

‘We don’t know what was said between the pair but it’s certainly ended in real tragedy.’
