Niki Lauda has questioned the wisdom of Flavio Briatore's return to Formula One as the potential head of a group designed to increase the sport's popularity.

Briatore is the former Renault team principal forced out of F1 for his involvement in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix 'crashgate' saga, resigning from his post the following September.

The Italian has rarely visited the paddock since, but was the name mentioned during a meeting between F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone and the team principals during the recent race weekend in Hungary as they sought ways to improve the show given the decline in audiences.

Three-time champion Lauda, who currently serves as Mercedes' non-executive chairman, has been left bemused by the links surrounding Briatore.

'Why do we need Flavio?' said Lauda.

'Bernie is the man in charge, and he should stay in charge. We should think together with Bernie as he is the master of what we can improve.'

It is understood Ecclestone was initially supportive of the idea, but has seemingly backtracked on the suggestion.

Speaking to German publication Auto Motor und Sport, Ecclestone said: 'We do not need Flavio. We can do it ourselves.'

Regardless of whether or not Briatore is involved, it is understood F1 is pushing ahead with a plan to set up the 'popularity working group'.

Despite sell-out crowds in Canada, Austria and at Silverstone, the empty grandstands at Hockenheim for the German Grand Prix sent alarm bells ringing.

Germany currently boasts a four-time champion in Sebastian Vettel and has Nico Rosberg in a Mercedes leading the world championship, yet just 52,000 showed on race day at a 95,000-capacity venue.

It is believed the popularity taskforce is to include Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo, Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner and Force India co-owner Vijay Mallya.

With a meeting also planned with the governing FIA, Ecclestone added: 'We simply want to see if there is the possibility to look at the rules because there has been so much negativity.

'We need to have a look at all of this and clear some things up.'
