At last night’s Democratic National Convention, there were many moments of cheering, chanting, and caterwauling. 

But one speech – made by former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm – seemed wholly bizarre, and was full of fist pumps, extreme facial expressions, and screaming.

In her fiery address, Mrs Granholm attacked Mitt Romney’s handling of the auto industry crisis while praising President Obama’s bailout, all while wildly gesturing.

Emotive: Former Governor of Michigan Jennifer Granholm did not hold back during her address last night

Rousing speech: Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm addressed the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte last night to an uproarious response from delegates

On the attack: In her speech, the charismatic Current TV host questioned Romney's response to the auto industry crisis

Yes we can: Gesturing heavily, she also praised Obama's rescue plan for American motors

Running the gamut: Her speech was filled with fist-pumping and clapping

Wearing a crisp electric blue blazer and white shirt, Mrs Granholm took the stage with visible energy, and began by telling the recent history of the auto industry in her state.

She spoke of the hundreds of devastated workers who were hit hard by Ford’s decision to close one of its largest plants in Wixom, Michigan, and how many workers came up to her asking why this happened, as they were all hard-working and loyal to the company.

The two-term governor said: ‘The entire auto industry, and the lives of over one million hard-working Americans, teetered on the edge of collapse; and with it, the whole manufacturing sector of this country. We looked everywhere for help.

‘Almost nobody had the guts to help us – not the banks, not the private investors and not Bain capital,’ she said, referring to Mr Romney’s op-ed appearing in the New York Times entitled ‘Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.’

The audience applauded, and the former governor continued, raising her voice and throwing her hands in the air, saying: ‘But, in 2009, the cavalry arrived: our new president, Barack Obama…he made the tough calls and he saved the American auto industry!’

The delegates in Charlotte, North 
Carolina began cheering uproariously, and maintained their energy 
throughout Mrs Granholm’s six-and-a-half minute speech.

Standing O: At many points in her six-and-a-half minute speech, she brought the delegates to their feet

High flying adored: With a vast array of gesturing, the Canadian-born American politician and TV host brought delegates in Charlotte to their feet cheering and clapping

Broadcast: She was projected out on the DNC monitors so every delegate could see her speech

But it wasn’t just Mr Romney’s stance on the auto industry she attacked. Mrs Granholm went on to question the Republican presidential candidate’s wealth. ‘How did he make that fortune?’ she asked, ‘and at whose expense?

'America, let's rev our engines! In your
 car and on your ballot, the "D" is for drive forward, and the "R" is 
for reverse – and in this election, we're driving forward, not back!'

‘You know, too often he made it at the expense of middle-class Americans. Year after year it was profits before people.’

Mr
 Obama, she said, saved more than one million American jobs with his 
bailout for the auto industry. But the most intense moment in her speech
 came when she again attacked Mr Romney, saying:

‘Sure, Mitt Romney loves our lakes and trees.

'He loves our cars so much, they have their own elevator. But the people who design, build, and sell those cars? Well, in Romney's world, the cars get the elevator; the workers get the shaft!’

At this point in the speech, she had to pause because she was drowned out by chants and cheers of ‘USA, USA.’

She concluded with several gestures: ‘America, let’s rev our engines! In your car and on your ballot, the “D” is for drive forward, and the “R” is for reverse – and in this election, we’re driving forward, not back! Let’s re-elect our great president, Barack Obama!’

Politico’s Dylan Byers said it was ‘by far the most energetic and well-received of any (speech) so far this evening while CNN wrote: ‘Her performance may be best summed up by a tweet: I’LL HAVE WHAT SHE’S HAVING!!!!’

Talking Points Memo critiqued: ‘Granholm’s wild gestures and energy level – which hovered between fired up and thermonuclear… - left the crowd delirious.’

However, not everyone was as wowed by the speech. Drudge Report, linking to a YouTube video of her speech, called it a ‘podium meltdown.’

The Canadian-born American politician serves as host for a prime time show on Current TV, the network created by former vice president and presidential candidate Al Gore, and is a columnist for Politico.
