An antique wedding car was among the five vehicles involved in the crash in Sydney's inner-west

Emergency services were called to Parramatta Road and paramedics treated a number of people at the scene.

Three people, including the driver of the white antique Jaguar, were later transported to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital with minor injuries.

Reports that wedding guests were among the injured were dismissed by police.

Parramatta Road was closed for a short period of time while emergency crews cleared the accident site.

NSW police are urging motorists to drive to the prevailing conditions as the wet weather continues across NSW.

Traffic and Highway Patrol Commander Assistant Commissioner, John Hartley said motorists and road users need to constantly evaluate the road and weather conditions.

'Due to the amount of wet weather we have received recently, it is important for motorists and other road users to be aware that road conditions may be constantly changing,' Assistant Commissioner Hartley said.

'Leave yourself plenty of time if you are planning a journey. We constantly remind drivers and riders to do this but it is imperative to avoid needlessly hurrying and taking unnecessary risks that affect you and other motorists.

'Slowing down in the wet conditions seems obvious but police officers are constantly detecting motorists who continue to drive at high speed risking their own and the safety of others.

'Ensuring that your vehicle is completely roadworthy with good tyres, brakes, windscreen wipers and fully functioning lights is required by law but is also vital.

It's unsure as to where the wedding party were heading at the time of the accident

'If you are not sure your lights are all operating as they should – check them, replace any broken globes and be prepared to use them if conditions deteriorate. Remember other drivers can see you far easier if your vehicle has the lights on!

'Many vehicles have brilliantly illuminated dash boards whenever they are being operated – however if you do not turn your headlights on at night, or have a vehicle with automatic light sensors your vehicle will not be visible to other road users.

'Sadly, officers across the state today, are investigating the cause of several fatal and serious injury crashes. In many cases driver error will be determined to be the cause,' Assistant Commissioner Hartley said.
