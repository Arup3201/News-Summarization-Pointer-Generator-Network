A collection of personal photos and handwritten notes from former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to the designers who made her clothes has sold for a staggering $28,400 at auction.

In the notes - among a few dozen pieces of private correspondence - stylish Onassis thanks her designers and even admits to tiring of the all-black attire long considered chic in New York City.

Writing to Bill Hamilton, then-design director at Carolina Herrera, she tells him: 'I just love this suit and will wear it everywhere as I am SO sick of everyone constantly in black.'

The letter, accompanied by Onassis's own sketch of a suit with single-breasted jacket, continues: 'Like Mediterranean villages where everyone is in mourning for 20 years.' 

The note was among numerous items of Onassis to have sold at Palm Beach Modern Auctions in Florida on Saturday. More than 1,100 people offered bids by phone, online and in person.

The lots also included private correspondence between Onassis and her interior designer Richard Keith Langham, as well as personal photos of her at Palm Beach, dressed in an array of outfits.

Auction house co-owner Wade Terwiller said Onassis wrote to both Mr Hamilton and Mr Langham about clothes and furnishings she was buying from the mid-1980s through her death in 1994.

He added that letters by the widow of President John Kennedy rarely appear at auction - and therefore, the collection fielded 'tremendous interest' in the around 20 lots available. 

'When we hold auctions of art and furniture, you don't see people engaging in dialogue at the preview. This was different,' he said.

'People wanted to comment on her clothes and recall where they were and what was going on when Jackie appeared in a particular outfit.' 

Potential bidders related to Onassis' thoughts on her personal style, including detailed instructions on how she wanted her jackets and pants to fit and pleas for more color, Mr Terwiller said.

He said the one woman read Onassis's note to Mr Hamilton in which she admitted she was 'sick' of the color black and found herself agreeing with the former  first lady.

'One of the women at the preview was reading that note and said, "I know what she meant about black. I'm sick of seeing black, too, and I'm from that generation",' he said.

'People really connected with Jackie,' he added.

Mr Hamilton recalled how Onassis would arrive for fittings with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich wrapped in aluminum foil in her handbag, ready to work through lunch to get the details right.

'To get the point across she would do drawings of ideas she wanted, from a canopy bed to a jacket,' he said. 'We spent a lot of time selecting fabrics. 

'She knew when she went out she had to look perfect.'

Co-owner Rico Baca said the notes about clothing and furniture purchases show the human side of the Onassis, who married tycoon Aristotle Onassis after her husband's assassination.

'In the notes, you get a sense of how someone famous can make the average person comfortable,' said Mr Baca, adding that he had expected bidding to start from $800 to $1,200 for each lot.

Impeccable: Fetching the highest bid was a book about Onassis's restoration of the White House, which she signed for Langham. It sold for a whopping $4,575.  Above, the former first lady is pictured wearing a yellow dress designed by Carolina Herrera in 1961 (left) and a ruffled black gown in 1979
