The husband of a woman caught having sex with a teenager is speaking out for the first time since the incident. 

Ryan Gibney of Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania says he's 'upset, hurt and just trying to keep his family together' after his wife Iris, a mother of four, was allegedly found naked and having sex with a 17-year-old in a parked truck.

Iris met the boy at a football game while volunteering as a cheer mom at her older daughter's school the unnamed teen told the arresting officer.

She has also been posting gifts her mom has been giving her, like matching Pandora bracelets, makeup and lingerie. 

According to NBC 10, Iris turned herself in Tuesday to be arraigned on charges including corruption of a minor, dissemination of explicit materials to a minor and trespass by auto.

The 42-year-old then posted the $50,000 bail and was back at her part-time job that same evening, working as an associate at Victoria's Secret in the King of Prussia Mall. 

Ryan also said he was 'up[set' and 'hurt' when he found out what happened

Iris and the teen had met at a football game, and been speaking through Twitter and a chatroom

Iris had also reportedly send the boy text messages with partially nude photos

After the arrest it was discovered that Iris and the teen had been communicating through a chatroom and Twitter, and that she had been sending partially nude photos to the boy from her phone.  

Oddlly enough, Iris told the officer who caught her and the teen, 'I’ve never been in trouble before. I can’t believe I did this. I have three children of my own — I am so, so sorry.'

This despite having four children. 

Oddly, Iris told the arresting officer she had three children, despite in fact having four according to Facebook

Iris also bought her oldest daughter makeup and matching Pandora bracelets after the incident

Iris now faces a preliminary hearing on December 30

The two were caught at around 10:30pm on November 15, which was a Saturday and not a school night, at Hollenbach Park, parked illegally at the park, which was closed.
