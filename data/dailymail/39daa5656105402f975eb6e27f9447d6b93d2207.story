A disgraced businessman who had affairs with women he met through dating websites and charmed them into handing over tens of thousands of pounds has been jailed.

Guy Brudenell, 44, who used the Sugar Daddy website to contact 'hundreds of women', told elaborate lies to cheat his victims out of a total of £66,000.

The conman spent the money on a luxury lifestyle, which included an exclusive apartment, massages, health and beauty treatments, topless dancers, a trip to the Monaco Grand Prix, a stay in a top London hotel and shopping sprees at upmarket department stores.

He lived in a £1.3million country mansion in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, with its own cricket pitch, tennis court, greenhouses, summerhouse, cottage and terrace on its 7.62 acres.

Nick Dry, prosecuting, told Teeside Crown Court that, to persuade his victims to hand over money, Brudenell told one woman who he had sex with that he had bowel cancer, and dropped another when he realised she did not have more money to give him.

One of the women Brudenell had an affair with and who tracked him down to his house and confronted him, told Judge Harold Crowson in a victim impact statement: 'I feel sexually violated by him.

'It frightens me there are such terribly dishonest people out there.'

Another said: 'Guy Brudenell has had a horrible detrimental effect on my life and still does to this day.'

One family was left so poor they had difficulty visiting their teenage daughter who was seriously ill in hospital.

In their victim impact statement, the family said: 'He knew our situation and continued to take our money. He even hassled me for money on the morning he was sentenced.'

Others had to spend tens of thousands of pounds and come close to bankruptcy to sort out the mess he left them in.

He contacted many of the women through the Sugar Daddy website, which aims to pair up women and wealthy men.

The court heard how he was a renowned Yorkshire businessman before the economic crash but was declared bankrupt in 2009 and jailed in 2013 for fraud.

Teeside Crown Court heard the former businessman also operated a building company illegally, defrauding people over house improvements, and arranged for the home of one of its clients to be turned into a brothel while its owners were on holiday.

Tracked down by North Yorkshire Police and brought to court to face justice for a £1.24 million series of frauds on business friends, he persuaded Judge Harold Crowson to grant him bail so he could 'put his affairs in order'.

But he continued to commit his crimes while on bail.

Sentencing him for the second time in just over a year, Judge Crowson told him: 'Your every act appears to have been calculated to fund the lifestyle you saw as your entitlement.

'I don't think any sentence I can impose will truly reflect the harm you have caused.'

Brudenell pleaded guilty to eight charges of fraud including one of defrauding the trustee overseeing his bankruptcy, one of creating a forged email which he used in one of the frauds, one of fraudulent trading and one of breaching bankruptcy restrictions by operating Hampton Rock building company. 

Many of the offences were committed while on bail.

Guy Brudenell jailed last June after pleading guilty to fraud and perjury at Teesside Crown Court.

The court heard that when he hit hard times Brudenell conned three acquaintances out of £1.24 million to service mounting debts and pay for a £15,000 Swiss skiing holiday and a trip to St Tropez, the court heard at the time.

He persuaded them to part with £600,000, £400,000 and £240,000 with the promise of quick profits on deals to buy repossessed houses.

As a respected figure in North Yorkshire high society, with interests in two leading hotels and a successful business past, no one doubted him until it was too late.

He lived in a country mansion with its own cricket pitch, travelled by private helicopter and enjoyed holidays in some of the world's most glamorous hotspots.

But behind the scenes he was using 'ever more desperate, and ultimately criminal, measures in his bid to stay afloat,' prosecutors said.

His empire eventually collapsed around him as he declared himself bankrupt with £21million debts in 2009.

Brudenell was forced to put his £1.3m home in Nawton, North Yorkshire, on the market. His 2005 marriage to wife Pennita - who arrived at their wedding in a Cinderella-style glass carriage - ended in divorce.

And soon police were probing his financial affairs. One of his victims went to police who uncovered a 'web of lies, deception and fraud.'

Altogether the frauds totalled £141,000, £66,000 of which he conned out of the women he befriended and others and £75,000 from the Hampton Rock fraud.

Judge Crowson added: 'All of it (was) going on a lavish lifestyle - something those victims can never have dreamt of.'

Brudenell was jailed for three years and eight months, to be served after the five years and four months Judge Crowson gave him in June 2013 for the £1.24 million frauds, giving a total of nine years.

He was given a ten-year financial reporting order under which he must tell police all about his financial and business affairs anywhere in the world and any changes in his name or permanent address every six months.

His barrister Alasdair Campbell said: 'There is little mitigation in respect of each offence which I can offer.'

He said of the 'hundreds of women' contacted by Brudenell through the Sugar Daddy website, four had said he had defrauded them.

Speaking after Brudenell was jailed on Friday, Detective Inspector Ian Wills who heads North Yorkshire Police's Financial Investigation Unit, said: 'Brudenell is a predatory fraudster who views every encounter and meeting as an opportunity to commit fraud. He has targeted people indiscriminately for many years.

'The evidence revealed that he regularly lied to family, friends and business associates about his need for funds and how they were to be applied.

'Between 2009-13 he was a prolific user of a dating website where he targeted women for sex and money.

'He was latterly offering bogus investment deals with the payments offsetting previous debt and funding his lifestyle. His offending continued up to the very morning he was imprisoned in June 2013.

'The tactics Brudenell used to delay repayment were callous, claiming to some that his girlfriend had cancer and latterly that he himself had bowel cancer.

'As in the previous case, he was also forging emails to encourage investment or delay repayment - all whilst on bail for similar matters.

'The sentence today should send a clear message to those who seek to deceive others.'
