New controversy: Jeremy Clarkson compares Kent residents with immigrants from the Sangatte refugee camp

He has mocked dead cockle pickers, India's poverty-stricken and striking public sector workers in recent weeks.

Now motormouth TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson has turned his acerbic humour to the people of Kent, suggesting the county is full of immigrants who escaped the  Sangatte refugee camp in France.

The Top Gear presenter made the comments in an article he wrote about Kent, in which he ranted about the difficulties of driving through the county and labelled it The Twilight Zone.

Clarkson
wrote in the latest issue of Top Gear: 'And what of the locals? Well, 
they tend to be the sort of people who arrived in the back of a 
refrigerated truck or clinging to the underside of a Eurostar train.

'And that reinforces my point rather well.

'Mboto has somehow evaded the gunmen and the army recruiters in his remote Nigerian village.

'He walked north, avoiding death and disease, and then somehow made it right across the Sahara desert to Algeria.

'Here, he managed to overwhelm the security men with their AK-47s and get on a boat to Italy, where he sneaked past the guards.'

He added in the Top Gear article: 'He 
made it all the way across Europe to Sangatte, from which he escaped one
night and swam to Kent.

'But that stumped him. Getting out of there was impossible, so he decided to make a new life in Maidstone.'

Alex King, Kent County Council’s Deputy, said: 'This is yet another example of Jeremy Clarkson ranting, which readers and viewers have become resigned to.

Garden of England... but Kent has come in for a Jeremy Clarkson lampooning

'Many people I know now ignore his personal views - but so far continue to enjoy his programme.

'Kent has a wonderful mix of people 
living here and is a county where Kent's people really make things 
happen despite the challenges of being a frontier county.'

Clarkson's article is just the latest in a series of controversial comments he has made in recent weeks.

Earlier this week he likened synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 Chinese cockle pickers in Morecombe.

In his column for The Sun, he said the sport amounted to
'Chinese women in hats, upside down, in a bit of water', adding: 'You can see that sort of thing on Morecambe Beach. For free.'

Twenty-three
Chinese migrant workers were drowned picking cockles in Morecambe Bay 
in 2004 after they were trapped by the rising tide.

Mocking: Jeremy Clarkson drove round Indian slums in this Jaguar fitted with a toilet, which he said was 'perfect for India'

Last month the outspoken presenter sparked outrage when he mocked Indian culture in the Top Gear Christmas Special.

Viewers were left furious after 
Clarkson staged a series of Carry On-style digs at the country's 
clothing, trains, toilets, food and history.

At one point, the controversial 
presenter ridiculed the unhygienic conditions and lack of sanitation 
among the poor by driving around the slums in a Jaguar fitted with a 
toilet.

Showing off the car's convenience, he boasted: 'This is perfect for India because everyone who comes here gets the trots.'

A
spokesman for the BBC confirmed the corporation had received 23 
complaints about content 'offensive to India' in the programme.

And
in November, Clarkson made controversial comments while being 
interviewed on The One Show about striking public sector workers, 
claiming they should be shot in front of their families.
