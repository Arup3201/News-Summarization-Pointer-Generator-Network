Whitehall officials are believed to have scrapped technology used in meetings amid fears they are being used by the Chinese government to eavesdrop.

The Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Crown Prosecution Service are all said to have stopped using equipment because of concerns they are being intercepted by the Communist state.

It is believed products manufactured by telecoms company, Huwaei, could be among the devices which pose a threat because of possible 'vulnerabilities'.

Allegations: The telecom giants are believed to be one of the companies whose products have vulnerbailities which could be exploited by the Chinese government

A Parliamentary security committee warned last year that the Chinese government might be able to ‘intercept covertly or disrupt traffic passing through Huawei-supplied networks’.

According to The Sunday Mirror, there are fears the equipment can be accessed remotely by the Chinese state and used to record top-level meetings and potentially extract highly-sensitive information.

The company is not said to be directly involved in the bugging of technology and have denied having close links with the Chinese state.

They have also refuted claims that they have been involved in any government contracts.

The Ministry of Justice is thought to have bought video-conferencing equipment in 2011 to set up conference calls with various meetings around the country.

Huwa technology has already been banned from contracts in the US and Australia over the perceived vulnerabilities in their system.

The former head of the Minister of Defence’s cyber security unit, Major General Jonathon Shaw claimed ministers were ‘compromising’ on security and ‘dealing with the devil’ in opening up to the firm.

George Osborne welcomed a £125million investment by the company last year.

During a trade visit, the Chancellor was seen laughing and joking with the founder Ren Zhengfei.

At the time, Mr Osborne said: ‘There are some Western governments that have blocked Huawei from making investments. Not Britain. Quite the opposite.’
