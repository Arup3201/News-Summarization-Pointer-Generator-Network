He's barely spoken more than a handful of words since he was two, but eight-year-old Jack Robbins has finally found his voice.

The little boy from Texas has severe nonverbal autism and can only utter single words about things he needs. 

But to his loving family's delight, Jack last week started singing the refrain from Katy Perry's hit song 'Roar': 'You can hear me roar!'

Gorgeous: Jack Robbins, eight, shocked his family by singing the popular refrain from Katy Perry's song 'Roar'

Jack's devoted mother Carla Robbins posted the heartwarming video to YouTube, where it has received nearly 300,000 likes.

'I 
was completely amazed and so excited,' Robbins, from Frisco, told NBC Today.

'For all these years, I’ve cooked for him, I put things on him, I dress 
him.

'I don’t know if he likes them or hates them. This is 
huge for me to finally know something that he likes.

'He works really hard and he takes what he gets. Sometimes I want him to say, 'I don’t like that'.

'He never does. Now I know something he likes and I’m so grateful for that.'

By the time Jack was diagnosed with autism at age two, he lost his ability to utter single words like 'mama' and 'dada'.

Intensive speech therapy helped him regain his severely limited vocabulary.

Robbins said her son often tried to sing along to tunes the family played, making irregular noises in a 'sing-songy' way.

So when the young boy began repeating a line with no background music playing, Robbins, her husband Brent Robbins and their son Joe, six, paid attention.

'That’s when we tried to decipher what he was saying,' Robbins said.

She said when the family worked out what he was singing, they filmed him.

'When I showed it to him, he loved it,' Robbins said. 'He seemed really excited that we knew what he was saying.'

She said Perry's song has become the family's 'anthem' after years trying to understand how to help and understand Jack.

'I hear it all the time and it makes me tear up every time I
hear it because I think of Jack,' she said.

For autistic children, music can play an important role.

'It serves to help calm and relax children with autism and it’s potentially a means for them to help develop language,' Dr. Ann Neumeyer, a pediatric neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said.

'If you can get them to use this 
alternative pathway through music to start speaking, then it helps 
grease the wheels for language.'

It's not the first time someone with autism has used music to express themselves.

Last year, 25-year-old Kyle Coleman recorded nine cover songs, stunning experts with his amazing singing voice. He can ordinarily only say a handful of words due to his autism.
