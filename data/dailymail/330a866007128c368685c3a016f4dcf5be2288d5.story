Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice opted for shades of pink today as they took to the river Thames for the Jubilee Pageant.

Accompanied by their 52-year-old father Prince Andrew the duo stood on board the Havengore taking the opportunity to wave to thousands of spectators lining the riverbanks.

Both sisters celebrated their grandmother's 60-year-reign with eye-catching Stephen Jones headgear, dashed with hues of fuchsia and coral.

Beatrice opted for a Suzannah silver and navy dress, silver tip pink Russell & Bromley heels accessorised with a pink bag from Le Meresca.

Meanwhile Eugenie opted for a figure-hugging coral Roland Mouret dress, LK Bennett shoes, covering up with a black knitted Moschino cardigan.

Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, who was not present voiced her family pride on Twitter, writing: 'Sooo proud of my girls smiling broadly, celebrating Granny with the Nation and Eugie with her flag and both happy smiles'. 

She also noted that her ex-husband Prince Andrew was looking 'very dashing in his naval uniform'.

London Mayor Boris Johnson took part with wife Marina Wheeler and stood waving from the deck of The Havengore, which was used to transport Sir Winston Churchill's body along the Thames on the day of his state funeral in 1965.

It has a plaque on board inscribed with Richard Dimbleby's words: And so the Havengore sails into history…not even the Golden Hind has borne so great a man.'

The Earl and Countess of Wessex, The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent were others to join the historic ship.

The £10.5million pageant has seen a 
flotilla of 1,000 boats and more than 20,000 participants take to the 
water in the largest celebration to be staged on the Thames for more 
than 300 years.

Stretching more than seven miles, the
cavalcade – which includes a remarkable floating belfry and several 
orchestras and choirs, is en route down the Thames from Battersea to 
Tower Bridge, with an estimated worldwide audience of a billion, despite the weather.

The police operation for the flotilla
was one of the biggest London has ever seen, with a total of 6,000 
officers on the ground for the event.

'Princess Eugenie' was a  worldwide trending topic on Twitter today as Diamond Jubilee celebrations kicked off.
