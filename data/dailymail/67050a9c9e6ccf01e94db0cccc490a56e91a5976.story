A valedictorian accused of bludgeoning and stabbing his mother to death at their home was filmed crying as police interrogated him over her death following his arrest, the footage reveals.

Jeffrey Pyne, 22, was taped wiping his eyes as he insisted he did nothing to hurt his mother, Ruth Pyne, who was found killed on May 27, 2011 in the family garage in Highland Township, Michigan.

The interrogation video was shown to jurors on Wednesday - the sixth day of Pyne's first-degree murder trial. The hours-long footage will continue in court on Thursday.

Prosecutors claim Jeffrey, a star 
student at the University of Michigan, was known to have a temperamental 
relationship with his mother, who suffered from 
several mental illnesses.

Struggle: Jeffrey Pyne, who is accused of killing his mother, cries during his interrogation by police

Insistence: In the video, which was shown to the jury in his murder trial, he denies killing his mother

She was bipolar and had spent two 
weeks in jail nine months before her death for attempting to strangle 
Jeffrey, according to reports.

But in the tapes, he denies hurting her and says he last saw her as he helped her unload groceries. He gave her and hug and then went to a woman's home a few miles away to carry out chores.

'Did you do anything at all to hurt your
mother?' an Oakland County Sheriff’s detective asks.

'No,' Pyne responds. 'I didn’t say anything hateful to her, I did nothing.'

He then puts his head in his hands and starts to cry, adding: 'I'm having a hard enough time.'

After going to the woman's house around 1pm to help with gardening and sweeping, he said he went to work for his 3pm shift.

His mother's body was found around 2.30pm by her 10-year-old daughter, Julia, and her husband, Bernard Pyne.

In the video, investigators ask about his relationship with his mother, the Detroit Free Press reported.

'I don't have a problem with my mom,' he says. 'The
only issue is, I wanted her to take medication. That was the
only problem I had with her.'

They also ask what he thinks happened to her.

'I don’t think she would hurt herself, she’s not that kind of person,' Pyne responded.

A detective says: 'Jeffrey, your mom was murdered. Somebody killed your mom.'

In court: Pyne is now on trial for first-degree murder but has the support of his family and community

Evidence? The jury was shown images of injuries on Pyne's hands, which he said he sustained at work

'I don’t know what to tell you,' the student responds, putting his hands to his face.

The murder trial began earlier this month with prosecutors playing the shocking 911 tapes that 
catch the horrific scene of the crime.

'She's laying in the garage,' her husband, Bernard Pyne, is heard saying. 'There's blood everywhere. I don't know what's going on.'

According to ABC, the accused Mr Pyne sat expressionless through the opening statements. He was arrested five months after the murder and held without bond for more than a year.

Prosecutors claim Jeffrey struck his mother, as he allegedly broke her arm and skull 
with a wooden board that his father noticed had been missing from the home, before stabbing her 16 times.

Detective Steve Zdravaovski also said 
that traces of Ruth's blood was found in the drain of the upstairs tub, 
implying that the murderer went to the first floor to clean after the 
afternoon murder.

Fall from grace: Pyne, a star student at the University of Michigan, was valedictorian at high school, right

Trial begins: Jeffrey Pyne, 21, faces life in prison if found guilty of the murder of his mother who was found bludgeoned to death in the family garage

Prosecutors claim he killed his mother after years of struggling with her deteriorating health, which often led to violent outbursts.

From 1998 onwards, she would threaten to kill herself and her son.
After this she was diagnosed with being both bipolar and a paranoid 
schizophrenic.

Over the coming years, psychiatrists 
would describe her as 'angry and violent', 'severely mentally ill', 'a 
danger to herself and others' and suffering from 'acute mania', court 
records show.

Prosecutors showed jurors photos of 
the blisters on Jeffrey's hands hours after the murder. He explained the
wounds to his boss as the results of throwing a shipping pallet.

'It did seem odd to me,' his boss, William Cartwright, said. 'I expected more of a splinter or scrape
than what looked like rope burns.'

Still, community members and Jeffrey's
father Bernard maintain that he is innocent. It took two days to find 
an impartial, 12-member jury.

Charmed life: The Pyne family owned a roomy tri-level home on a one-acre lot with a pool in Highland Township, a rural community in western Oakland County

'The people in the community are 
hugely supportive of this young man,' Detroit Free Press journalist Lori
Brasier told ABC News. 'Even people who believe he may have actually 
killed his mother still support him, and you don't usually find that in 
the community.'

The defense has suggested that the 
brutal murder could have been committed by an intruder although nothing 
was stolen from the home, according to the Detroit News.

'Somebody else committed the crime,' they said. 'We believe the evidence will show you that.'

If convicted, Jeffrey Pyne faces life in prison.
