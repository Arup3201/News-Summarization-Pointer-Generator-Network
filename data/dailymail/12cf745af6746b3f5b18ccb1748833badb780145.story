Superstar rapper Iggy Azalea may be regretting indulging in pizza this weekend after a Papa John's delivery guy dished out her phone number.

The singer, who attended the Grammys on Sunday in LA, tweeted shortly before the awards ceremony: '@PapaJohns was my favorite pizza but the drivers they use give out your personal phone number to their family members.' 

Papa John's swiftly responded to Iggy's complaint with the message: '@iggyazalea #We should have known better. Customer and employee privacy is important to us. Please don't #bounce us.'

Iggy then shared the text messages that she was receiving from strangers after a Papa John's delivery guy gave out her number

The singer then shared with her 4,2million Twitter followers a text message she had been sent from a random stranger.

'Hello is this iggy azalea my brother had delivered something from Papa John's to u and he gave me the number on Friday night i am ur number one fan  call me back please,' it read.

A follow-up message said: ''Is this u please answer u r my idol.' 

The singer refused to let go of the invasion of her privacy and tweeted: 'And the supervisors at @PapaJohns refuse to send pictures of their employess [sic] so you can identify who it is that steals your information.'

She added: 'You know, to protect their privacy... Too bad they don't value the privacy of their customers also. #DamnShame.' 

Rival pizza company DiGiorno's was quick to jump on the Papa John's PR disaster by tweeting at Iggy: '@IGGYAZALEA delivery. smh'

She replied: '@DiGiornoPizza I know right!' 

A Papa John’s spokesperson told Daily Mail Online: 'Privacy of our customers and employees is extremely important to us. Papa John's has taken appropriate disciplinary action with regard to the employee involved. We are reaching out directly to Ms. Azalea and hope to resolve this incident and make it right.' 

It was unclear whether the employee had been fired.  

Iggy, 24, attended the Grammys on Sunday night at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. 

The Fancy and Bounce hitmaker missed out on an award in the categories she was nominated in - Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Best Pop Duo/Group and Best Rap Album.

But she never got round to sharing her acceptance speech with the audience as she was snubbed for all four awards after losing to Eminem, Sam Smith - twice - and Christina Aguilera.
