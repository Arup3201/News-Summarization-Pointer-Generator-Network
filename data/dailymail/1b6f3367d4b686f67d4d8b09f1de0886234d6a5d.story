One million people are caught in the Boston city security lockdown as police hunt the surviving marathon bomb suspect.

Streets are deserted as authorities warned residents to lock their doors and remain inside as they continue the manhunt for the surviving suspect 
from the marathon bombing as the entire city of Boston is deserted.

The city is being controlled by SWAT teams and an army of police as they try to keep everyone indoors by shutting down the entire public transportation system, closing schools and ordering businesses to remain closed for the day.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority subway and commuter rail system is shut down until further notice as officials try to keep citizens off the streets following the fatal shoot out in Watertown early Friday morning that lead to the death of the first suspect.

Ghost town: Boston's normally busy streets were completely empty as the town was under strict lockdown orders

Front row seat: A woman in Watertown peaks out from behind her curtains as she tries to figure out what is going on in her neighborhood after police told everyone to remain indoors

Closed campus: All public schools and more than 16 colleges in the area were part of the lockdown

Nowhere to turn: Police have been going through the second suspect's reported neighborhood door-by-door, but the lockdown was extended to all of Boston (downtown pictured here)

Amtrak services in the area around 
Boston has been suspended indefinitely, keeping people- including 
19-year-old suspect Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev- from leaving the city.

'This is a serious situation, we're taking it seriously. We're asking the public to take it seriously as well,' Governor Deval Patrick said in a Friday morning briefing.

He said that the transport systems will remain shut down until further notice.

Megabus cancelled 18 buses and other bus companies including Bolt Bus, Greyhound, and Peter Pan-that were scheduled to travel between Boston and neighboring states, changing plans for more than 1,000 passengers.

Off the roads: The entire city was eerily quiet during the lockdown, that remained for most of Friday

Looming: Residents anxiously awaited a conclusion of the manhunt so they could go outside

Unusual sight: More than a million people were told to stay in their homes and not go to work

Helpful: The Governor said the 'shelter in place' order was used so police could quickly mobilize and track the suspect

Flights into Boston's Logan Airport are 
still being permitted to land, but the passengers will have a lot of 
trouble getting into the city given the lockdown.

All public schools and 16 of the city's colleges were closed for the day.

A
 late addition to the list of closed universities was UMass-Dartmouth, 
after school officials realized that he was enrolled at the college.

'UMass
 Dartmouth has learned that a person being sought in connection with the
 Boston Marathon bombing has been identified as a student registered at 
UMass Dartmouth. The campus is closed. Individuals on campus should 
shelter in place unless instructed otherwise,' a school spokesman said 
in a statement.

Officials
 have called for businesses to remain close and are asking for their 
cooperation in keeping their employees off the streets. Taxi services 
have been suspended as well.

In some areas, cars are banned from 
the roads as another tact for authorities to keep control of the area. 
It will also theoretically help them single out Tsarnaev if he is on the roads.

No hustle: As the manhunt continued into the afternoon, there was still no sign of life at Boston's Downtown Crossing

Lonely: The wallkway by Commonwealth Avenue was completely abandoned

Initially
 residents of Watertown, Waltham, Belmont, Newton, Cambridge, Alston and
 Brighton were specifically warned to stay inside, as they are the 
neighborhoods near the home of the suspects on Norfolk Street in 
Cambridge.

Between 250,000 and estimated 400,000 people live in those towns.

At the 8am press briefing, the shelter-in-place order was extended to include all of Boston.

Police conducted a door-to-door search
 in Watertown, warning that if anyone other than federal officials are 
seen in the area or ask to enter a home, the residents should call 911.

Suspect: Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, now 19-years-old, is seen in these two pictures that were released by authorities

Shelter in place: Earlier orders highlighted the towns surrounding Watertown, but it was expanded to include all of Boston

Opposite: Historic Faneuil Hall (on the left) is one of Boston's busiest hubs of activity in normal circumstances

Bizarre: The emptiness of the streets is unnerving for many Bostonians who have been keeping in touch using social media

Ghost town: Storrow Drive was almost entirely empty after the lockdown

Governor
 Patrick reiterated that order at the press briefing, warning Bostonians
 'not to open the door for anyone other than a properly identified 
officer'.

Officials are not 
taking the situation lightly, issuing a warning to residents that 'a 
terrorist that wants to kill people is in your area'.

'We're going to need the public to help us help them keep us safe,' Mr Patrick said.

'We have every asset that we could muster.'

Eerie: Suburbs around Boston were included in the forced lockdown

Lockdown: All Boston residents were told to stay inside as police- and the Special Operations officers seen here- take control of the city during the manhant for the second marathon bomber

Waiting for news: A man looks out of his window in Cambridge, one of the town over from the suspect's home

No change: The Mayor said that the lockdown will continue until further notice

Witnesses: Two residents look out at the action as police swarm Watertown looking for the second suspect

Door-to-door: Authorities are telling residents not to open the door to anyone that is not an officer as they search all of the neighboring homes in Watertown
