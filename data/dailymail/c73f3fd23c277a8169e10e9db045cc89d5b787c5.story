An estimated 200 African immigrants tried to climb over a razor wire fence and claim asylum a Spanish enclave of Melilla in northern Morocco. 

Spain claims sovereignty over two areas of Morocco which they treat as Spanish national territory. 

As a result, both areas are very popular with migrants looking to make their way to the European Union as they do not have to attempt a perilous sea crossing to the Spanish mainland.

Melilla is one of two enclaves in northern Morocco which Madrid regard as Spanish national territory 

Over the past 24 hours, more than 200 immigrants tried to climb across the razor wire fence protecting Melilla. Only ten managed to pass the formidable barrier and make it into Spanish territory. 

Spanish Civil Guard officers also try to prevent the migrants from reaching EU territory. 

The ten successful immigrants have been taken to a short-term holding centre where a decision will be made about their future. 

During the first half of 2014, 75,000 people have tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa trying to land in Italy, Greece, Spain and Malta. 

More than 1,000 people have drowned attempting to cross by sea - even though the sea is just nine miles wide at its narrowest point. 

In recent years, Spanish authorities have increased the security of Melilla and its second enclave of Ceuta.  

These men successfully made it across the border and are awaiting a decision on whether they can remain

The migrants attempt to cross the border without any personal belongings - many do not even have shoes
