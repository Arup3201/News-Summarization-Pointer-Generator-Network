The top Bolshoi dancer accused of masterminding the acid attack on artistic director Sergei Filin - and paying £1085 for it to be carried out - was today refused bail.

Pavel Dmitrichenko, 29,  was remanded in custody until at least 18 April as the probe goes on into the ballet scandal .

Dmitrichenko, admitted in court ordering attack on Filin, 42, but claimed he wanted 
an accomplice to 'beat him up' and did not sanction the use of sulphuric
acid, which left the ex-dancer partially blind and his face disfigured 
from severe burns.

An alleged accomplice, Yuri Zarutsky, is accused of accepting 50,000 roubles, around £1,080, from Dmitrichenko to attack Filin.

While accepting he wanted his boss beaten up, he insisted: 'It's not true that I ordered him to throw acid at Filin'.

'I told Yuri Zarutsky about the policies of the Bolshoi Theatre, about the bad things going on, the corruption,' he said.

'When he said: `OK, let me beat him up, hit him over the head,' I agreed, but that is all that I admit to doing.'

Defence lawyer Alexander Barkhanov 
said: 'My client never had any intention of causing such harm to health,
all the more in such a loathsome way like disfiguring the face or the 
loss of sight.'

Several Bolshoi dancers came to court
to support him, adding to other voices claiming there are still more 
surprises over this murky case.

Andrei Bolotin insisted Dmitrichenko 
was not guilty. 'We do not have anything to prove it but simply all of 
us are certain about it. We think it is a terrible mistake.'

'There have always been conflicts in Bolshoi but it does not mean that 
one of our colleagues can be made a criminal,' added Roman Denisov.

Zarutsky and alleged driver Andrei Lipatov were also remanded in custody.

The case has become more murky as 
Filin claimed from hospital in Germany that Russian police have failed 
to arrest all those responsible while a prominent ex-prima ballerina 
alleges a full scale cover-up is underway.

'It's not true that I ordered him to throw acid at Filin,' he said.

He was motivated by fury at Filin snubbing his partner 21-year-old Anzhelina Vorontsova, claim police.

'The
main reason he gave to the investigator is revenge,' a police source 
told Izvestia. 'Filin did not let her play leading dancing roles in the 
Bolshoi.

Dmitrichenko stressed that he did not ask for an acid attack and wanted the attackers only to beat Filin.'

Dmitrichenko
- who faces up to 12 years in jail if found guilty - claimed in court 
that he was horrified when he realised that acid was used in the 17 
January attack on Filin.

'When I heard what happened to Sergei, I was just in shock,' he said.

'I could not believe that the man who proposed beating him up went ahead and did this thing with acid.

'I did not order harm done to this man.'

However, Dmitrichenko and accomplices
evidently also hacked 16,000 emails of top Bolshoi figures as he sought
to prove that Filin demanded a percentage of fees obtained by troupe 
members in TV or sponsored dancing engagements outside the theatre.

'If
you want to take part in something like this, you must make an 
agreement with the boss and, as far as I know, share your profits,' he 
said.

Filin has not commented on this claim but speaking through his wife 
Maria Prorvich told how he  suspicions about Dmitrichenko - but believed
that a 'much wider' circle of people linked to the theatre were 
involved.

She claimed those guilty included 'not just the three who they arrested.
We hope the security forces unearth all those people who are connected 
to this crime.'

She also strongly disputed that Dmitrichenko's anger over Vorontova was the only reason behind the attack.

This theory was 'exceptional and wild', said said, adding: 'It is unlikely that it is all because of one ballerina. Sergei thinks that motives for this crime are a bit different. And this girl is just a cause but surely not the main reason for the crime.'

Her comments suggest that a plot to blind and disfigure Filin with acid may go much wider and perhaps higher at the Bolshoi.

Meanwhile, 37 year old Anastasia Volochkova - well known to London 
audiences and once controversially fired by the Bolshoi for being 
allegedly overweight - expressed doubt that Dmitrichenko was really the 
key player behind the attack.

'I have got my own idea. It seems to me that all this is a fake version and has nothing to do with the accident,' she said.

'The administration of the Bolshoi is trying to disclaim its guilt and to kill all suspicions.'

Alleging a cover-up, she said: 'All that is going on now is an attempt 
to take the suspicions away from the administration which may have been 
connected to this event.'

Another Bolshoi source added doubt to the police version that Dmitrichenko was the mastermind.  

'Filin certainly squeezed out Vorontsova, but that is not a reason to throw acid in someone's face.'
