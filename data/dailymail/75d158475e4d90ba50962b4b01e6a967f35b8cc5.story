Hugh Bonneville was forced to fill in a form and pay an administration fee – just for obtaining his own photograph

He is one of the most well-known faces of television.

But it seems even Hugh Bonneville cannot escape the endless bureaucracy of the BBC, as he discovered last week.

The actor, who stars as Ian Fletcher in the BBC series W1A, found himself forced to fill in a form and pay an administration fee – just for obtaining his own photograph.

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the show’s director John Morton told a chuckling audience that BBC staff refused to let the actor have his own photograph without following the time-consuming procedure.

Mr Morton said: ‘I got copied into an email in which Hugh Bonneville had been asked by a fan, could they have a signed photo of him as Ian Fletcher.

‘He didn’t have one so he emailed the BBC and said is there a photo of me as Ian Fletcher that I could acquire to sign and send to this fan.

‘The person replied and said you go to the BBC publicity site, you follow the link, you fill in the form and you pay £55.

‘He emailed back and said are you sure that a main character in one of your shows has to fill this in? And the person emailed back saying “yes this is the case”.

‘Hugh then copied all that into (Director General) Tony Hall.’

It comes after the BBC was criticised for ‘ridiculous box-ticking’ after it emerged applicants seeking freelance assignments with the BBC are being asked if they are gay and whether they received free school meals.

The new 31-page questionnaire has been ridiculed over the intrusive and apparently pointless questions, loaded with impenetrable jargon and acronyms.

But managers insisted the form-filling is designed to ensure the BBC is meeting its ‘diversity’ targets.
