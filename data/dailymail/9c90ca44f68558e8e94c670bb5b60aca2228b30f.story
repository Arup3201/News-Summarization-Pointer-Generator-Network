European Tour CEO George O'Grady has been forced to apologise for using the word in an 'inappropriate' way

The head of the European golf tour has apologised for using the term 'coloured' reopening a racism row involving players Sergio Garcia and Tiger Woods.Â 

European Tour CEO George O'Grady said that 'most of Sergio's friends are coloured athletes in the United States.'

But speaking after he made the offensive remarks, he said: I deeply regret using an inappropriate word in a live interview for Sky Sports for which I unreservedly apologise,' O'Grady, who is British, said in a statement released later Thursday.

Woods and Garcia been locked in a bitter exchange of words over the past two weeks dating to the third round of The Players Championship when Garcia implied that Woods purposely stirred up the gallery as the Spaniard was playing a shot.

But the situation turned nasty when Garcia and his Ryder Cup teammates were at a dinner. The emcee, Golf Channel's Steve Sands, jokingly asked Garcia if he would have Woods over for dinner during the U.S. Open.

'We'll have him round every night,' Garcia replied. 'We will serve fried chicken.'

The remark was reminiscent of Fuzzy Zoeller's similar comment about Woods during his record-setting victory in the 1997 Masters, when Woods became the first player of black heritage to win a major.

Garcia initially released an apologetic statement and followed it up Wednesday at a news conference from the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, site of the European Tour's flagship event.

'I feel sick about it and I feel truly, truly sorry,' he said.

Garcia said he meant to give a funny answer to a playful question, and it turned out to be 'totally stupid and out of place.'

In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Woods said: 'The comment that was made wasn't silly.

'It was wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate. I'm confident that there is real regret the remark was made.

'The Players ended nearly two weeks ago and it's long past time to move on and talk about golf.'
