As the 'fight of the century' continues to heat up, Floyd Mayweather was full of confidence during the press conference as he was joined on stage by Justin Bieber - who has accompanied the undefeated champion on multiple occasions. 

Bieber has proved himself to be quite the good luck charm and took part in the ring walk in the boxer's last fight against Marcos Maidana.

The 38-year-old champion couldn't help but bring his pop star friend on stage for a photo op after the press conference in Los Angeles for his superfight with Manny Pacquiao.

With a 47-0 record on the line, Mayweather knows this fight is without doubt the biggest of his career - and the most lucrative.

His 36-year-old opponent also seemed to be in his element during the media frenzy for a fight he's been gunning for over the past few years.

Bieber has attended most of the boxer's fights in recent years and even got to enter the ring as one of Floyd's entourage members in May 2012.

The match with Pacquiao has been years in the making as even on that night, he stated his desire to face the Filipino fighter.

Mayweather told a US broadcaster for HBO after the fight: 'This fight right here, I was looking to fight Manny Pacquiao.'
