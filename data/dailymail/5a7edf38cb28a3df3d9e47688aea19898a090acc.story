Wanted: The carjacker is wanted by police after stealing an Audi A4 and tossing out its pensioner passenger

A carjacker drove off with an 83-year-old woman in the passenger seat - then pushed her out of the moving vehicle, police have said.

The victim was sitting in the couple's Audi A4 outside a newsagent's while her 88-year-old husband was in the shop.

A man suddenly climbed into the driver's side and drove the car away.

The alarm was raised when a customer ran into the shop telling the victim's husband: 'Your wife's been kidnapped.'

The couple's son said his parents had been left 'mortified' by the incident on Coal Clough Lane in Burnley, Lancashire.

He said his mother was taken to hospital and treated for shock and minor injuries.

Police have released CCTV images of a man they want to trace.

The car, a Â£7,000 blue Audi A4, was stolen along with possessions the couple were carrying upon their return from a weekend away.

Their son, a retired police officer who asked to remain anonymous to protect the safety of his shaken parents, said: 'I am absolutely seething.

'They are an old couple and they are really shaken up by all this. Every time I talk to my mum she just starts crying.

'They are very upset and frightened, and my dad is very confused. He feels as if he is at fault and it has certainly knocked him back.

'They have lived in Burnley all their lives and they think the streets are paved with gold. They love Burnley, but this goes to show that there are some really evil people here.'

The incident took place at around 8.40am on Sunday, April 7 when the car was parked outside Coal Clough News.

Police have only just released the details.

The woman was sitting in the front passenger seat, with the key in the ignition, when a man climbed in.

Shocking: The incident, earlier this month, happened outside this Burnley newsagents

The carjacker then repeatedly ordered her to get out of the moving car, before slowing down, pushing her out of the door and driving off.

The victims' son, 53, said: 'Dad had just called in to get his Sunday newspapers when another customer ran back into the shop and told him: "Your wife's been kidnapped".

'He rushed outside and the car and mum were both gone. You can imagine how terrified he was.

'The car had gone so far down the road he couldn't see my mum. Luckily, her physical injuries aren't too bad but mentally it has scarred them.'

DC Russ Hilton, from Lancashire Police's Pennine Target Team, said: 'This is a shocking crime against an elderly, retired couple who have simply called into a local shop for a Sunday paper.

'The 83-year-old victim was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital and treated for shock. Fortunately she only suffered minor injuries.

'I'd ask people to take a close look at the CCTV images and if they recognise the man or have any information that could assist with our investigation to get in touch.

'The man in the CCTV has entered the newsagents prior to the offence stating he was going to get a train back to Manchester so it is likely he is not local. He is described as scruffy and gaunt in appearance with a very pronounced nose.

'The car's registration is P70 WCB so I would also be keen to hear from anybody that saw this vehicle on April 7, or knows of its current location, to call Lancashire Police on 101.'

People with information can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
