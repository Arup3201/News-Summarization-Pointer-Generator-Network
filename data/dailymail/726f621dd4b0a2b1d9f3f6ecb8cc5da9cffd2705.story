It’s the vegetable that kids the length and breadth of the country do their best to avoid on Christmas Day, so they’re bound to approve of sprouts being served up as an alternative power source for tree lights instead of being served up on their dinner plates.

One thousand of the raw vegetables have been used by scientists from The Big Bang UK Young Scientists and Engineers Fair to create the unusual battery for the decorations.

It is the world’s first Christmas tree to be powered by these vegetables and it’s been placed on London’s Southbank area – a sight that’ll give sprout-haters everywhere a warm glow.

Way to glow: The eight-foot Christmas tree is on display on the Southbank in London with the lights powered by 1,000 Brussels sprouts

The grand unveiling ceremony took place on Tuesday morning, with pupils from the City of London Academy flicking the switch.

The battery for the eight-foot tree was created using five power cells, each holding 200 sprouts, producing 63 volts from the 1,000 Brussels sprouts.

This comes into the 'extra-low voltage' category – like a telephone – and is safe to touch.

Green energy: The battery was created using five power cells, each holding 200 sprouts

Essentially the battery works like electrolysis.

Copper and Zinc electrodes are placed in each Brussels sprout to create a chemical reaction between the electrodes using the acid in the sprout - generating a current which can be stored and used to power the LEDs on the tree. 

The battery was created using five power cells, each holding 200 sprouts.

These in turn produce 63 volts from the 1,000 Brussels sprouts.

The power is stored in a capacitor and released through 100 high efficiency LEDs.

The Big Bang scientists are able to monitor the voltage on a separate display, which shows how much energy is being produced by the sprouts.

The battery will last for as long as the sprouts stay fresh.

Sean Miles, Director of Prototyping at Windsor-based Designworks, which made the installation, explained that how long the battery lasts depends on how long the sprouts stay fresh.

He said: 'They will keep generating a current for as long as the vegetables stay fresh, and not decomposed. As long as they're fresh they will keep providing the electrolytes for the chemical reaction that generates the current.'

The sprouts powering this tree should last a month, but more can always be added if it runs out of juice.

In theory, he explained, any fruit or vegetable could be used to power the lights, but sprouts are actually the least efficient.

He added: 'Sprouts are probably the worst vegetables to use, which makes the feat even more amazing. The more moist and fluid, the better they are at conducting electricity.'

Paul Jackson, the CEO of Engineering UK, which runs The Big Bang UK Young Scientists & Engineers Fair, said: ‘We want young people to think about STEM subjects in an interesting way and are always looking for different ways to do that.

'It being the festive time of year – and kids’ dislike of sprouts being well documented – using them to create a battery seemed like a unique way to achieve that aim.  

‘Every year thousands of pupils and teachers attend the Fair, which exists to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.

'We want to extend the buzz of the Fair further and wider, so that even those who can’t attend are encouraged to consider careers in science, technology, engineering and maths.’
