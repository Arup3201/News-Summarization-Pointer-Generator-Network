Cause of death: An autopsy has determined that a bullet fired by a police officer damaged a major vein in Tamir Rice's intestines resulting in his death

Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice died from a single shot to the abdomen fired by a rookie Cleveland police officer in what has now been ruled a homicide, according to an autopsy released today.

The bullet that ended the boy's life damaged a major vein and his intestines, the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's findings showed.

Tamir was shot outside a city recreation center on November 22 after officers responded to a 911 call about someone with a gun at a playground. 

Surveillance video released by police shows the boy being shot within 2 seconds of a patrol car stopping near him. He died the next day.

Police have said rookie officer Tim Loehmann, 26, believed the boy had a real firearm. They later discovered it was an airsoft gun, which shoots nonlethal plastic projectiles.

Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, said at a news conference earlier this week that she did not allow her son to play with toy guns, and that her son's friend gave him the pellet gun.

A grand jury will consider whether charges against Loehmann are merited.

The autopsy said Tamir was 5-foot-7 and weighed 195lbs. The report did not say how long it took officers to administer medical help after he collapsed to the ground mortally wounded.

A federal lawsuit filed by the boy's family against the City of Cleveland and the police department claimed that Loehmann and his partner, seven-year veteran Frank Garmback, waited four minutes before anyone provided first aid to Tamir.

The lawsuit also said the two officers acted recklessly when they confronted Tamir in a terrifying manner, driving within feet of him and firing within seconds. 

Samaria Rice said the officer who fired the fatal shot should be convicted of a crime.

The officer's father has said his son had no other choice because he thought the weapon Tamir was seen reaching for in his waistband was real, given that it lacked the orange tip indicating that it was a toy.

Several peaceful protests have taken place since the shooting, which has come at a time when police-involved deaths around the nation have drawn on spotlight on departments and their use of force.

Last week, the US Justice Department released the results of a nearly two-year investigation of Cleveland police that found its officers use excessive and unnecessary force far too often. 

The report was completed before Tamir's death.

Officer Loehmann joined Cleveland police in March after spending six months in 2012 with the police department in suburban Independence.

The Rice family's lawsuit filed laws week noted that personnel files showed that police supervisors in Independence decided Loehmann was 'weepy,' 'distracted' and lacked the maturity needed to work in their department. 

A letter in his file said there was a pattern of a lack of discretion and not following instructions.

'In law enforcement there are times when instructions need be followed to the letter, and I am under the impression Ptl. Loehmann, under certain circumstances, will not react in the way instructed,' the letter said.

Loehmann resigned from the Independence Police Department in December 2012 after meeting with his supervisors about their concerns.

Rice's attorney, Benjamin Crump, told reporters Monday that a grand jury was not necessary and that there was enough probable cause from the video to indict.

'The things that he did in that video, which I suggest is enough probable cause to indict the police officer now and have a trial jury where everybody can see it, where it can be transparent,' Crump said. 

Samaria Rice said her sixth grader was her 'baby' and was loved by everyone, adding that he helped at school and at the recreation center where he was killed.

'Tamir was a bright child, he had a promising future, and he was very talented in all sports - soccer, basketball, football - he played the drums, he drew, he played video games, he's a great swimmer,' Rice said.
