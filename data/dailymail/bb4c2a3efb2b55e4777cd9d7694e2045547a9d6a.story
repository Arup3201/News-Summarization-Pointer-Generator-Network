'Death preventable': Compulsive eater Mark Lawrence (pictured) choked to death on a chip after blundering care home staff housed him in a room next to an unmanned kitchen

A care home has been £150,000 after a compulsive eater choked to death on chips which he took from an unmanned kitchen, a court heard.

Blundering staff housed 55-year-old Mark Lawrence in a room adjacent to the cooking area despite being fully aware of his disorder.

When the kitchen was unmanned, he crept in and took a bowl of chips which were cooking in the oven.

He was later found dead on his bed after choking on the food which he had crammed into his mouth.

Today, a judge fined the owners of Mr Lawrence's care home £150,000 and ordered them to pay almost £50,000 in prosecution costs after hearing of the vulnerable man's death.

The court heard that Mr Lawrence had previously eaten a dishwasher tablet, cat food, raw joints of meat, including chicken, and had also tried to stomach a rubber glove.

He also ate half a bag of frozen Brussels sprouts and, just three weeks before his death, had to be treated by paramedics after choking on cheese.

The home's owner, Caretech Services Ltd, was fined after admitting breaching regulations at the home in Banbury, Oxfordshire.

Judge Patrick Eccles said: 'In my judgement, this is a death that was preventable and was foreseeable.'

The local authority prosecuted Caretech Services Ltd under Health and Safety legislation, arguing that Mr Lawrence was should not have been placed in such a position next to the kitchen.

Barry Berlin, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Lawrence had an obsessive-compulsive eating disorder, which had been recognised at least since 2003.

'It involved compulsive overfilling of his mouth. Mr Lawrence had been known to eat raw meat, raw chicken and even cat food. He would eat anything if it was in front of him. He didn’t chew his food and was known to be at risk of choking.'

Mr Lawrence, who was originally from Surrey, had a number of mental health problems and learning difficulties, but was said to be generally polite, well-mannered and well-liked.

He was on one-to-one supervision, particularly during meal times, when he was given liquidised food.

His compulsive eating was compounded by a fixation on opening cupboards and the oven, 'presumably looking for food', the judge was told. The fridge and cupboards were locked, but not the kitchen or oven.

Mr Berlin said at 5.45am on March 9, 2008, Mr Lawrence fell down the stairs at Greenacres, the small home in Banbury, where he had lived for 12 years.

Despite suffering a broken arm and screaming in pain, paramedics were not called by staff until 8am, when the home's manager Deborah Bleach arrived.

Mr Berlin said: 'He was thereafter put, as a temporary measure, from his upstairs bedroom to a room downstairs, which was previously the dining room and was of course very close to the kitchen.

'It was 140cm from the oven to his bedroom. It was an inappropriate place to put him.'

He said that while a risk assessment was carried out in relation to Mr Lawrence’s mobility, none was carried out concerning his eating compulsion and the location of his new room.

Although the move was meant to be temporary, it remained in that room until his death in May 2009.

At 5pm on March 28, 2009, support worker Bonny Mukababege was baking some chips in the oven.

She was called to deal with another resident and when she returned minutes later she found the oven empty, and chips on the kitchen floor.

'She went to Mark’s room and saw him slumped on his bed. There were chips in his mouth,' said Mr Berlin.

Ms Mukababege tried to remove the chips, but she and her colleague were unable to revive Mr Lawrence. Paramedics were called but he was pronounced dead.

Investigators from Cherwell District Council found Caretech staff had not reported Mr Lawrence’s fall down the stairs breaching official regulations.

Keith Morton QC, representing Caretech, extended the sincere condolences of the directors of the company towards Mr Lawrence’s family and friends.

He said the firm had cared for around 5,000 vulnerable adults and children since it was founded in 1993 and that it took its responsibilities to those in its care very seriously.

'The circumstances surrounding the death of Mark Lawrence reveal shortcomings which should not have occurred and for which the company wishes to apologise,' he said.

'The company has admitted that the shortcomings were a cause of Mr Lawrence’s death.

'There was a failure to review the risk assessment with regard to his propensity to eat food. There was a failure to enforce the control measures that had been identified.'

He stressed that Mr Lawrence had been happy at Greenacres and after his fall his family had not wanted him moved to another establishment.

He also said that since the incident Caretech, which runs more than 150 homes, had imposed new structures within the company and invested heavily to ensure there would not be a repeat incident.

Judge Eccles added: 'Those failures led to his untimely and shocking death. There were failures to respond appropriately to what are described as "near misses".'

Yet he acknowledged the company’s previous record, its response to the incident and its guilty plea.

For breaching Health and Safety regulations he fined Caretech £140,000. For the breach of the reporting of injury regulations, he fined them an additional £10,000.

Caretech must also pay court costs of £48,540 pounds and a £15 pounds victim surcharge. Greenacres is now empty and no longer belongs to Caretech.

A spokesman for Cherwell District Council said: 'We trust that the outcome will serve to underline the inadequate care and attention paid to those disabled people who have the misfortune to experience life in sub-standard care homes in this country. We also hope it will obviate any further tragedy such as we have endured.'
