The Swedish government has said it will be calling for new elections next year, just two months into office.

Prime Minister Stefan Lofven made the announcement after parliament rejected the left-wing minority government's budget proposal in a vote today.

The Social Democrat-Green Party coalition's budget was voted down after right-wing anti-immigration party Sweden Democrats decided to back the centre-right opposition.

Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, second from right, surrounded by, from left, Minister of Education Gustav Fridolin and Deputy Prime Minister Asa Romson of the Green Party and Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson of the Social Democrats, announced that new elections will be held next year

The government will not officially announce the re-election until December 29, as the Swedish Constitution states that a government has to have been in power for at least three months before doing so.

Speaking at an emergency press conference this afternoon, Lofven said he will call for new elections to be held on March 22 next year.

'I have taken responsibility, I will be taking the responsibility today,' Lofven said, adding that he blames his predecessors in government, the centre-right Alliance coalition led by Moderate Party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt, for the re-elections.

'They [The Alliance parties] are allowing the Sweden Democrats to dictate the terms of Swedish politics.

'These are irresponsible actions by five political parties that are unprecedented in Swedish history.' 

Attacked: The centre-right opposition, seen here (L-R) is Anna Kinberg Batra, who is a hot candidate to take over leadership of the Moderate Party,  Goran Hagglund (hidden), Christian Democrats; Annie Loof, Center Party and Jan Bjorklund, Liberals, were accused of letting the far-right 'dictate the terms of Swedish politics'

182 lawmakers voted against the budget in Parliament Wednesday, while only 153 voted in favor. 

The far-right Sweden Democrats emerged as power-brokers after the September election, after being voted the country's third biggest party with 13 per cent.  

Lofven became prime minister in October as head of a coalition with the Greens, promising to reverse many reforms by the previous center-right government.

He accused the anti-immigrant party of wanting 'to knock out any government that doesn't dance to their tune.'

From the start, Lofven's minority government — which has 138 seats in parliament — was expected to struggle to push its agenda through. With the support of the former Communist Left Party, which stands outside the Cabinet, it controls 159 seats.

The center-right opposition, made up of four parties, has 141 seats, but the 49 extra votes expected from the Sweden Democrats would be enough to topple the ruling coalition.
