A Texas animal shelter may face legal action after putting a dog down last week for ‘unknown demons.’

The New Braunfels Humane Society’s euthanization of a puppy brought to the shelter after being found abandoned has been called unlawful by Elaine Buchhorn – and she is considering suing over the dog’s death.

The animal’s execution was announced last week on the suburban San Antonio pet rescue center’s Facebook page despite Ms Buchhorn calling every day to check on the animal’s status, she told the Houston Chronicle.

Haunted by demons: The humane society claimed it 'set free' the puppy by putting it down

The post read ‘the pup is now free, free from whatever unknown demons were causing the aggression,’ said the Chronicle. The posting is no longer visible on the shelter’s page.

Found in July by Ms Buchhorn’s son, she told the paper, the Dachsun-Chihuahua mix was only 11-weeks-old when brought to the Humane Society earlier this month.

‘Baby George’ was brought to the humane society with two objectives in mind, to make sure he was safe around Ms Buchhorn’s two-year-old granddaughter and to help find him a new home, she told the paper.

‘He was very socialized,’ the woman told the Chronicle.

Ms Buchhorn told the Chronicle she also said to notify her if finding the dog a home was a problem.

‘I said, 'Before you try to euthanize this dog, I will appreciate a call because I'll take the puppy back and try to find it a home on my own.’

Only three days later, the dog was put down for aggression – leaving the animal lover shocked.‘They never admitted the puppy was aggressive to me over the phone.’

Ms Buchhorn told the paper she may sure the shelter for violating laws requiring they provide the dog with food, water, care, or shelter for an animal. Another local resident already filed a complaint with local police.

A shelter official who spoke to MailOnline disputes Ms Buchhorn’s claims, saying she released all legal rights to the dog when she handed it over to the human society.

‘She signed a release form over to us releasing the animal and the rights to the animal over to us ,’ executive director Billie Zercher said. ‘Our policy is anything that shows aggression towards a person we cannot place up for adoption.’

‘Baby George’ tried to bite two employees on two separate occasions, Ms Zercher explained, leading to the decision to euthanize him.

When pressed over claims Ms Buchholz had asked to be notified in advance if the dog was to be put down, Ms Zercher replied ‘I’m not arguing what she’s telling local media.’

‘We receive in numerous animals every single day,’ Ms Zercher further explained, ‘we cannot call every single person that releases an animal over to us.’

Of the 4,000 animals taken in by the shelter this year, 500 have been put down, according to Ms Zercher. She declined to break down the reasons for the animal deaths.

This is an unfortunate circumstance,’ Ms Zercher said. ‘[but] we have to be careful what we adopt out.’

Ms Buchhorn told the Chronicle she has yet to receive an apology, and regrets bringing the dog in.‘It still haunts me, I'm living with the regret of taking him there.’
