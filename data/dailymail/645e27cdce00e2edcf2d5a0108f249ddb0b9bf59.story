Matthew Upson is set to play in Leicester's Under 21s match against Benfica on Monday as he steps up his recovery from a serious ankle injury.

The former England centre-back has been out since undergoing surgery in August but he has returned to training and is in line to make his return to action in the Premier League international Cup.

Upson, 35, has yet to feature for Leicester in the Premier League following his free transfer from Brighton and his return to the field is a huge boost to Nigel Pearson following a run of four successive defeats.

Pearson said: 'Matthew has been training very well and he will play some part in a game next week.’

Fellow defender Liam Moore, who missed both England Under-21 matches during the international break, is fit to face Sunderland on Saturday.

He was struck down by illness but has recovered after taking a course of medication.

‘It was an infection which, without going into details, needed medication,’ said Pearson. ‘He trained intermittently and is much better now.’
