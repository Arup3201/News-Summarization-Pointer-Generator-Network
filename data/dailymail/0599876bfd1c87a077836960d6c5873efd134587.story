An Italian prison is caught up in an extraordinary row after prison officers allegedly organized regular 'happy hours' for inmates' where they drank alcohol and got visits from 'external guests'.

The female prisoners at San Vittore jail in Milan, Italy, were given the unusual treat at least twice a week where they got to let their hair down, according to reports in Italian newspaper Ansa.

Italy’s prison service said that 
organizing events was not unusual, when everything happens ‘in broad 
daylight, as in this case, we believe’.

Good times: Prisoners were even provided with a catering service at the events

However, Italian prison guards' union Osapp have blasted the revelations.

It lodged a complaint to both the Ministry of Justice and the Senate president over the allegations.

According to Osapp, prison staff agreed to organize the happy hours which ran until ‘late at night’ with ‘external guests’.

Prisoners were even provided with a catering service and offered alcohol, say reports.

The union has called into question both the costs and profits of the venture, asking for ‘urgent clarification’ from the Italian authorities.

Luigi Pagano, deputy director of Italy’s prison service said he had not been contacted by Osapp and had requested more information on the entire situation.
