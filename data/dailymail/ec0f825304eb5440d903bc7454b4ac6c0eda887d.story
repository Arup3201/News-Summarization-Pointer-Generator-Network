A thug who shut his terrified cat 
in a tumble dryer and put it through three spin cycles is being hunted by the RSPCA after users of a web forum reported him when he posted footage of the abuse online.

Officers are trying to identify the cat owner who posted the sickening film under the alias Nitroazza on a site for radio controlled car enthusiasts.

The man, who listed his location as Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, joked that his pet Princess was 'the new Mr Tumble' and asked viewers to rate the disturbing video.

Miraculously, the cat survived its ordeal and emerged from the tumble drier alive but very shaken.

A Cambridgeshire RSPCA spokeswoman said: ‘The matter has been passed on to our acting chief inspector.’

She said they wanted to hear from anybody who has the cat attacker’s real name and address.

‘The video is really horrible.

‘We were quite shocked,’ said the furious spokeswoman.

‘The door to the tumble dryer was opened and closed three times.’

Princess miraculously survived her nightmare attack, but the RSPCA said the poor cat would have been ‘very distressed’.

If caught, the person responsible could be jailed for up to six 
months and fined up to £20,000 for animal cruelty under the Animal 
Welfare Act 2006.

A still image of the footage uploaded online shows 'Princess' the cat trapped inside the tumble dryer. The video has now been taken down.

The sickening cruelty, posted on Modelsport UK’s internet 
forum, was downloaded and forwarded to the RSPCA and a local newspaper by outraged 
forum member Karl Stockley, who captured screen shots of the arrogant perpetrator’s 
web comments.

The uploader, whose profile says he is 22 and married with a baby son, wrote: ‘Like cats?

‘Check out my cat, the new version of Mr Tumble.’

He finished off his stomach-churning ‘joke’ with a smiley face before asking fellow members to comment and rate his video.

In later posts he told viewers his cat was called Princess and that she should be shot.

Horrified forum members blasted the vile video, which has now been removed from the website.

One forum member posted: ‘There is something 
not right here, I was trying to figure out if it was real or not.

‘I certainly hope not.'

An apology was later posted by the ‘Nitroazza’ which read: ‘It was 
wrong of me to put up edits of animals, especially in that manner up on 
public forums - I am very sorry if you’re a cat lover.

‘You will not be seeing anymore.’

Mr Stockley, who reported the cruelty, is now helping the RSPCA as they hunt the man responsible.

He said: ‘I was taken aback when I saw it.

‘I looked back on his profile and he’s apologised for the video, he knows he’s done wrong.

‘I just hope he gets what he deserves.

‘People like him shouldn’t be allowed to have pets, full stop.’

The sick footage was uploaded to the Sportsmodel UK web forum with this message - which asks users to rate the video
