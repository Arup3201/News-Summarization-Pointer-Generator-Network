Malaysia Airlines is set to pay £30,000 to the families of passengers who were on board missing flight MH370 but the final amount of compensation will only be paid once the 'issue of the tragedy' is over, it has been reported.

The airline is thought to have already paid £3,000 to family members in expenses as they waited in hotels in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing to hear news about their loved ones after the flight went missing in March.

The Malaysian government has now set up a committee to oversee the needs of the families of the 239 people who are still missing after boarding the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

The head of the committee, deputy minister of foreign affairs Hamzah Zainuddin, told the Wall Street Journal some of the families had already received the payment but the final amount of compensation is yet to be decided. 

He added it will only be paid once ‘the issue of the tragedy is over.’

It is thought this can only be determined once the plane is found and a cause of the crash is eventually established.

Under international law, Malaysia Airlines and its insurers are liable to pay out around £100,000 per person to families of those on board, however experts have warned the amount of compensation could be subject to a legal battle between the families, the airline and plane manufacturer Boeing.

Despite extensive searches of the Southern Indian Ocean off the western coast of Australia, the missing plane, which left Kuala Lumpur on March 8 is yet to be found.

It is thought the distraught families of those still missing will receive a payment of £30,000 but final compensation will not come until the 'issue of the tragedy is over'

On Wednesday, two dozen relatives of Chinese passengers who were on the missing flight gathered at the airline's regional office in Beijing to demand more information about the plane.

Under the tight watch of at least a dozen Chinese police and several building employees, the family members were kept from entering the office building.

Relatives say they have been demanding the flight data of the plane, analysis of its possible tracks and videos of the passengers boarding the flight.

Earlier this week it was revealed that the Australian government expects to spend around £50 million on the search by July 2015.

A Malaysian official has said that the bill will be split evenly between his country and Australia.

However, the Australian Transport Minister Warren Truss declined to say whether this would be the case.

He said: ‘I don’t want to give any indication as to where it’s likely to end up. We are talking about this with the Malaysians and other countries who have got a key interest.’

The search area, where it is believed the plane crashed, has changed several times but a group of countries are continuing to negotiate on how to fund the next phase of the sonar search, which will cover an area of 21,600 square miles.

Countries involved in the search include Malaysia, Australia, the United States, China, Japan, Britain, South Korea and New Zealand.
