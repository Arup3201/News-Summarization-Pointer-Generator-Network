A Russian teenager has been left partially blind and disfigured after a £3 eyelash treatment caused severe chemical burns around her eyes.

Singer Masha Kuznetsova has to wear make-up whenever she is on stage.

But rather than use mascara for each performance, the 13-year-old's parents decided to tint their daughter's eyelashes instead. 

Masha Kuznetsova is a singer who regularly has to wear make-up while on stage. The make-up artist who gets her ready advised her parents an eyelash tint could speed up the process

Masha, 13, from Volgograd, was left with severe chemical burns around her eyes

They took Masha to a beauty salon in the city of Volgograd, in south-western Russia's Volograd Oblast. 

The couple said they paid the equivalent of £3 to have both their daughter's eyebrows and lashes tinted.

Masha's father Sergey Kuznetsov, 42, said: 'They never gave us any warning that there were any risks.

Her father Sergey Kuznetsov, 42, said the salon they chose didn't warn them of the risks

'And we certainly never expected in our wildest dreams that she would be left with a disfigured face, chemical burns and partial loss of vision in one eye.

'It all happened two months ago and she is still in pain and unable to perform properly.

'But not being able to perform is the least of our worries, the fact that she is in so much pain and looks like this is a disaster for our daughter.

'She was an outward going and happy individual, and now she's a nervous wreck who just wants to hide in her bedroom the whole time.' 

He said Masha had been delighted when she was chosen as a soloist to perform in the Volgograd Cossack ensemble.

He added: 'The beauty salon that used to do her make-up suggested the colouring would make it quicker to get ready, and we agreed.

'When it all went wrong, I was shocked that they didn't even apologise.

'I am taking them to court, demanding compensation.'  

Make-up expert Elena Antonova, 33, told Russian media that if the chemicals using during the colouration process not been properly mixed or applied, it could easily cause the damage that the 13-year-old experienced.
