A grandmother has discovered an unusual cure for a painful eye condition which causes her eyes to close against her will.

Moira Gleed, from Wrexham, was used to spending her entire day in darkness, until she realised that bursting into song could relieve her of the condition.

The 66-year-old suffers from focal dystonia - a rare muscle complaint which causes her eye lids to spasm shut.

Mrs Gleed said: 'My eyes used to get incredibly red and inflamed and were always itchy and sore.'Then I began to realise that my eye lids would just involuntary close. There was no way I could move them - apart from prising them open with my fingers.

'It was awful. I had to give up my job as a careers advisor, I couldn’t drive. I felt really lost. But then one day at my local choir practice, I was singing my heart out and all of a sudden I realised I could see the conductor. My eyes were open!

Focal dystonia is a neurological condition which affects the muscles around the eyes, causing muscle spasms that make them close, twitch and blink.

Mrs Gleed now walks with the aid of a stick and wears dark glasses and a visor. She said: 'It all started off with extreme light sensitivity. I didn’t question it at first but then my eyes started to get really sore and dry.

'I went to an optician and they thought I had inflammation of the eyes, but any medication I was given just made no difference.

'It was hard because I’d explain to my doctor what was happening but he had no idea what it was. I had so many referrals and appointments.

'Except for when I’m singing I almost feel like I’ve got sand in my eyes every minute of the day. They’re gritty and dry all the time.

'They don’t open properly but they don’t close properly either so that adds to pain.'

Various over-the-counter remedies have failed to work. Mrs Gleed also has Botox injections every 10 weeks to relax the muscles around her eyes, but the success is variable. 

Thanks to her remarkable discovery, Mrs Gleed says she has a new lease of life. 'Singing just lets me forget about my problems and recharge my batteries for a bit,' she said.

'I suppose it is quite unusual. As soon as we stop singing and there’s the piano accompaniment or the introduction of the song my eyes are closed. And then as soon as I start singing, they open again.

It's thought that activities such as singing can act as a distraction, causing the symptoms of dystonia to disappear temporarily

'There seems to be something to do with music that forms a connection with me. I feel an incredible bond to it. I even find myself singing all the time now just to get a bit of relief.'

Focal dystonia is just one type of the condition which affects at least 70,000 children and adults in the UK.

Paul King, chief executive of the Dystonia Society said: 'Dystonia is a neurological condition where incorrect messages from the brain cause muscles to become over-active.

'It can affect many different parts of the body - and causes disabling and often painful postures or movements.

'For reasons that are not fully understood, shifts in attention can sometimes cause the symptoms to disappear temporarily. This can lead to people affected by dystonia finding relief in unexpected ways.

'Other examples we’ve been told about include being able to shout at the dog but not talk properly, being able to dance fine but not put the foot down flat normally, and being able to run for the washing when it’s raining, but find it extremely painful to walk.

'Unfortunately, the symptoms tend to reappear as soon as the activity causing the distraction finishes.'

Moira now hopes to set up a support group in North Wales to help others affected by the condition.

Thanks to her new found love of singing, Moira has even got her family and friends to get involved in belting out a song or two.

'My family are so proud of me and they see how happy singing makes me. I even managed to get my husband, Mike, to join the choir.

'The other day my grandson wanted to see my eyes. So I sang a little song and they popped open. It’s marvellous!
