The unprecedented scale of the Conservative operation which failed to hold back the Ukip tide in Rochester and Strood can be laid bare today.

Leaked emails sent by the party’s Whips’ Office show that in the 54 days since MP Mark Reckless’s defection to Ukip, there were around 100 separate visits to the constituency by Cabinet ministers, including five by the Prime Minister.

Some 246 Conservative MPs – 80 per cent of the total – hit the campaign trail, with so many there that they were asked to sit in offices stuffing envelopes rather than knocking doors, amid reports voters were sick and tired of constant canvassing.

On October 16, David Cameron introduced the Conservative Party's candidates Anna Firth and Kelly Tolhurst at the Wainscott Memorial Hall in Rochester

On October 24, Mr Cameron attended a community forum in Chatham, Kent, as he campaigns for the Conservative party in the Rochester and Strood by-election with candidate Kelly Tolhurst (second right)

In the early days of the campaign, David Cameron was quoted as saying privately he wanted to kick Mr Reckless’s ‘fat a*** out of the Commons’ and insisting he would ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at winning the seat.

Ukip’s triumph – its second by-election win in weeks – shook all three main parties. Nigel Farage declared there were now no no-go areas for his party and neither the Conservatives nor Labour could hope to win next year’s General Election outright.

But Tory jitters were limited by the smaller-than-expected majority, with senior Eurosceptics, including John Redwood and John Baron, speaking supportively. Ukip had forecast a win by 15 percentage points or more just days ago, but Mr Reckless won by 2,900 votes, or just 7 points.

‘It isn’t big enough,’ said one MP sceptical about the party leadership of Mr Reckless’s majority. ‘If you’re an MP flirting with defection and you look at those numbers in a by-election when people want to kick the Government, you have to be thinking you wouldn’t hold on to your seat at the General Election.’

Mr Cameron said: ‘I’m absolutely determined to win this seat back at the next General Election. Because anything other than a Conservative government will put our recovery at risk and mean Ed Miliband in Downing Street.’

Bookmakers have installed the Conservatives as favourites to retake the seat in May’s election.

Emails prepared by the Whips’ Office show that at least 100 visits were made to Rochester by Cabinet ministers, with each member asked to go five times, and MPs to make three visits at their own expense. The emails reveal that 246 MPs made at least one visit, and most had made several.

Mr Cameron said he would ‘lead from the front’ by doing the same, but his final two visits to local businesses, as Ukip surged in the polls, were notably low-key.

Ukip and Labour believe the Tories must also have come close to the spending limit for a by-election – of £100,000 – after holding an expensive open primary vote of residents to choose their candidate. The party also hired no fewer than four shops in the constituency to act as bases. Every Saturday, buses full of young activists – so-called Team 2015, who were used to great effect in the Newark by-election the Tories won earlier this year – arrived to pound the streets. One minister was quoted at the start of the campaign as saying it would be ‘like Newark on crack cocaine’.

The Tories’ operation to try to secure the seat for their candidate, marine surveyor Kelly Tolhurst, reached fever pitch on polling day as hundreds of activists, including MPs, went canvassing.

Miss Tolhurst had used a public meeting to appeal to voters from the Labour, Lib Dems and Greens to vote tactically for the Tories in order to keep Ukip out. And on the final day, thousands of glossy personalised leaflets – bearing the name of each voter – were sent to likely Tory voters, encouraging them to go to the polls.

One MP, who is on the Right of the party, said they and several colleagues were ‘incandescent’ about a letter Miss Tolhurst sent to voters, approved by Tory HQ. Despite not once mentioning she was a Conservative, it mentioned Ukip twice. It also mentioned ‘uncontrolled immigration’ and the fact some local people felt unsafe on their high street due to crime, in a way that critics said made it appear the issues were linked. Miss Tolhurst denied she had intended a link.

The MP said: ‘A lot of us thought it was deeply unpleasant.’

Patrick Brione, director of research at pollster Survation, said: ‘All MPs were instructed to visit the constituency at least three times and over a hundred MPs did so on multiple occasions; David Cameron himself made five visits. The party had shipped in activists from across the country to bombard the constituency with canvassing – their resources extended as far as being able to pull off a logistically impressive 6am mail drop to households across the seat on the morning of the vote.

‘Despite all of this, the party failed to retain a seat with a 10,000-vote majority, against an opposition party which had not even fielded a candidate at the previous election. The implications for the Conservatives are potentially dire.’

Michael Gove accused Mair of playing a game of 'political snakes and ladders' on Radio 4

Michael Gove today accused the BBC of ‘political game-playing’ after he was repeatedly asked about the Prime Minister’s failure at the ballot box.

In a hostile exchange on Radio 4’s PM, the Chief Whip told presenter Eddie Mair he was playing a game of ‘political snakes and ladders’ rather than asking about issues of substance.

After Mr Mair accused Mr Gove of dodging a question about whether he should resign if there are more defections to Ukip, the former education secretary seemed to become frustrated.

‘Your question was, if I may say so, the type of political game-playing that puts people off BBC interviewers because of instead of asking about policy you’re asking about position,’ he told Mr Mair.

‘One of the things people dislike about politics is the way that commentators instead of talking about issues of substance, such as employment or inflation, play a game of snakes and ladders, and who is up and who is down.’

Mr Gove said the Conservatives were on course for victory in May’s general election despite suffering a second drubbing at the ballot box in just six weeks.

When repeatedly pressed to explain why Mr Cameron ‘can’t win’, Mr Gove insisted he ‘secured a bigger swing than any leader since 1930s’ at the last general election and is ‘winning the economic argument’.

He added that ‘there is no one to match David Cameron in terms of the strengths of leadership’ among current politicians.

Asked if he would resign as Chief Whip if another Tory defects to Ukip, he told the programme: ‘I’m convinced that nobody will so the matter doesn’t arise.’

Mr Gove has previously said that there are not too many immigrants in Britain – a key Ukip claim – but he refused to repeat the comments in an interview with Channel 4 News last night.

Queue of others waiting to defect gloats Farage 

Nigel Farage today predicted that more MPs would defect to Ukip next year.

Arch Conservative eurosceptic Philip Hollobone flanked Tory defector Mark Reckless as he was sworn in as Ukip’s second MP, raising speculation he may be next to jump ship.

Ukip leader Mr Farage suggested Tory MPs facing a threat from Labour in northern constituencies would be the most likely to see their future in his party, and mentioned a list of five of the most likely. Some have ‘no chance of winning on a blue rosette but might do on a purple rosette’ at the general election, he said. Asked who he was thinking of, he gave no names but referred to a list drawn up by academic Matthew Goodwin of the five most likely Tories to defect to cling on to their seats.

It includes Chris Kelly, MP for Dudley South, who is already quitting in May, David Nuttall in Bury North, Martin Vickers in Cleethorpes and Nigel Mills in the Amber Valley. All have denied they will defect.

The fifth, Basildon and Billericay MP John Baron, said recently that ‘you should never say never in politics’. Another who has denied he will defect is Adam Holloway, Tory MP for Gravesham in Kent, who Mr Farage said he had spoken to but would not say when, or what they discussed.

Mr Farage did not expect more MPs to join Ukip straightaway, but expected some to reach a decision over Christmas.

He said: ‘I would be very surprised if there weren’t defections of MPs between now and the general election.’ He had spoken to Labour figures, but they were more scared of a voter backlash.
