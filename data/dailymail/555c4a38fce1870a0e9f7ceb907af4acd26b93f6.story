It's a problem shared by married couples the world over.

Conflicting work schedules and the hectic pace of modern life can mean husband and wife quickly become little more than ships that pass in the night.

But for the Queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips and her husband Mike Tindall it seems absence really is making the heart grow fonder.

Busy schedules: Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall enjoy some rare time together as she competes at the Banbury Horse Trials last year

She is an Olympic horsewoman with a packed timetable on the three-day eventing circuit and he is a professional rugby player who captained the Barbarians in their defeat against England on the weekend.

So with both busy training and competing around the world, they haven't been seeing much of one another lately.

But when asked if being apart could actually be the secret of a successful marriage Ms Philips answered a resounding yes.

'Exactly', she laughed: 'And we get to
watch each other when we're off - although I suppose it's not very 
helpful if we want to go away together.'

Nuptials: The couple married at Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh in 2011

From the start, the marriage between Ms Phillips, currently the 14th in line to the throne, and the burly 16st Mr Tindall,  was anything but a traditional Royal affair.

They
met in 2003 when Mr Tindall was in Sydney for the Rugby World Cup. She 
happened to drop into the bar where he was drinking with friends. They 
struck up a conversation and soon became an item.

Mr Tindall's alcohol-drenched stag do in Florida was the stuff of legend, resembling a Brits abroad-style reality TV show.

He and his rugby-playing mates were pictured guzzling copious amounts 
of beer in a swimming pool and the party later racked up a bar bill of 
£12,000 – in the space of five hours.

Their wedding, in July 2011, was held not at Westminster Abbey but at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh.

She pledged to honour but not to obey and kept her maiden name.

The reception, which was attended by the Queen, featured a vodka fountain and was said to involve some seriously hard-partying.

Tindall himself was only spotted returning to the bridal suite, still wearing his morning suit, at 2pm the following day.

But their apparent relaxed attitude and obvious joie de vivre has appeared to serve them well as husband and wife.

'Mike and I are very lucky in that we've got careers and we've been able to follow our dreams,' Ms Philips told the Sunday Express Magazine.

'I don't really have any plans at the moment but in my sport you have to take it year by year. When you work with animals you can't plan too far ahead because something always goes wrong.'

In January this year the couple sold 
their £1.2 million white stucco marital home in Cheltenham in order to 
live on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Park estate near Minchinhampton, Gloucester.

The house, on the estate of the 
Princess Royal, already stables Zara's horses and is where she trains 
both racehorses and her three-day eventers.

Mr Tindall is said to have developed a fondness for horses, and has even started riding.

'He's quite good, actually,' Ms Philips explains. 'He has ridden, especially right at the beginning of our relationship,' adding she believes this was partly because he was trying to impress her.

Mr Tindall had the the last laugh when he was widely mocked for splashing out £12,000 and it went on to win the Welsh Grand National.

Despite buying their Cheltenham home 
shortly after their wedding, in July 2011, Zara has always kept the home
she previously lived in on her mother's estate.

The couple's first home was a cottage called The Bothy at Gatcombe, and was given as a gift from the Princess Royal.

To her credit Ms Phillips remains refreshingly down-to-earth, with a hands-on can-do attitude, something she believes she shares with other women in her family.

'My grandmother's like that,' she adds. 'And her mother before her, and my mum.'
