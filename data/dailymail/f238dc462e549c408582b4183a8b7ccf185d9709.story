A stash of raw tobacco worth £5million which could be mixed with potentially harmful chemicals has been uncovered at an illegal cigarette factory

Investigators swooped on an industrial unit in Bury, Greater Manchester and discovered the warehouse packed with weighing scales, chemical drums and fake packaging, all equipment needed to make fake cigarettes.

The tobacco, valued at £5million in unpaid VAT and duty, was found alongside £15,000 in cash, which is now being processed under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

It is thought that the chemicals and machinery found meant it was to be used to produce and sell illegal tobacco products across the UK.

And people are being urged to be wary of the low quality tobacco in products they are buying.

Four men - two 35-year-olds from Bury and two from Blackburn aged 41 and 29 have been arrested.

They were held on suspicion of evading duty contrary to the Customs and Excise Management Act but have been released on bail. Investigations are continuing.

The warehouse is being linked to other tobacco seizures and is believed to be just one site used by a suspected network of organised criminals.

Other swoops were made in Essex, Preston and Blackburn - netting 11 tonnes of raw tobacco in total.

Fifteen thousand pounds in cash was also uncovered and is now being processed under the Proceeds of Crime Act

The warehouse in Bury was raided by HM Revenue and Customs officers at the same time as two domestic houses and a garage in the area, which were all searched as part of Operation Eel.

The tobacco was found wrapped in boxes and bags and is believed to have been illegally brought into the UK without excise duty being paid.

HMRC said it was 'in the process' of being mixed with chemicals at the unit by a gang and converted into hand-rolling tobacco.

Dry, harvested tobacco leaves are believed to have been imported from tobacco growing country then processed using and white vinegar, and flavoured with vanilla, according to HMRC.

'There are no controls over what is mixed into counterfeit cigarettes and by buying it smokers are funding international organised crime gangs,' an HMRC spokesman told MailOnline.

'We are cracking down on it.'

Fake printed wallets would be filled with tobacco and used to dupe customers into believing they were genuine.

Sandra Smith, assistant director of criminal investigation's at HMRC, said: 'Illicit tobacco factories hidden in our communities are packaging low quality tobacco and I'd urge people to be wary.

'Cheap tobacco may seem like a bargain, but there are no controls over what is mixed into the product and by buying it smokers are funding organised crime gangs.'
