The Duchess of York joined Cherie Blair to honour Asian women overcoming obstacles in business, the workplace, sports and culture at the Asian Women of Achievement Awards 2013 last night.

Dressed in a traditional yet glamorous purple sari with an embellished piece of head jewellery, Sarah Ferguson most certainly looked the part as she celebrated 13 women recognised for their outstanding careers.

She was joined at London's Hilton Park Lane hotel by awards patron Cherie Blair, Princess Badiya bint El Hassan and Maria Miller MP.

The most prestigious accolade of the evening went to Sue Kukadia, director of global immigration at Ernst & Young, who took home the RBS AWA Chairman’s Award.

The Entrepreneurial Asian Woman of Achievement Award was taken home by Sipra Deb, who launched a Sheffield-based family play centre after overcoming the tragic murder of her father and leaving her career as a molecular biologist.

Ishrat Bano, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Cambridge, was awarded the Professional Asian Woman of Achievement Award for her contributions to science, amongst many other winners.

The awards evening was founded by India-born author and entrepreneur Pinky Lilani OBE back in 1999.

Held in association with The Royal Bank of Scotland, the Asian Women of Achievement awards have quickly become the most important and established programme to recognise the contribution of Asian women to Britain’s economy and society.

Pinky Lilani said: 'There is a growing confidence, positivity and youth about the new generation of Asian women achievers in Britain.

'When I started the Asian Women of Achievement awards in 1999, Asian women often worked away from the mainstream, accomplishing in their local communities, in niche industries, and a long way from the spotlight.

'Today, Asian women occupy positions of influence and power at the heart of British business, politics and society. I am delighted that the Asian Women of Achievement Awards continue to recognise the brightest and best, and that we can come together to celebrate the achievements of these amazing women.'

Chris Sullivan, Chief Executive, RBS Corporate Banking, added: 'This year's winners of the Asian Women of Achievement Awards have exhibited success, verve and tenacity, and provide inspiration to us all, and we hope in particular to future generations of Asian women to fulfill their potential.

'RBS aims to promote diversity and encourage debate about how to nurture talent wherever it is found through direct support on the ground, for example, meeting the needs of women start-ups, to looking at how  businesses can develop more diverse leadership teams and boards.

'We are proud to support these awards which showcase the often unsung achievements of Asian women.'

The Asian Women of Achievement Awards are hosted by Caspian Media and Real Business, in association with The Royal Bank of Scotland and supported by the likes of British Airways and Visa Europe
