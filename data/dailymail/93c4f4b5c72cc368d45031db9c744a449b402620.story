A 17-year-old Connecticut boy charged with stabbing a classmate to death in school on their prom day pleaded not guilty to murder today as his attorney said he was investigating a possible mental health defense.

Christopher Plaskon entered the plea in Milford Superior Court, answering a judge's questions in a firm voice. He also waived his right to a probable cause hearing and elected for a trial before a three-judge panel rather than a jury.

Plaskon is charged with fatally stabbing 
his friend Maren Sanchez in a hallway at Jonathan Law High School in 
Milford in April.

Plaskon's attorney, Richard Meehan, said 
after the hearing that it would be premature to say he's going to mount a
 mental health defense, but he said doing so would be more difficult 
before a jury.

Plaskon, whose family attended the 
hearing, is on anti-psychotic and anti-anxiety medications but is lucid,
 Meehan said in court.

'Obviously we have an obligation to this young man based on the things that we do know to evaluate what his mental status was,' Meehan said.

'I'm a firm believer juries have a difficult time with issues pertaining to mental health in the criminal justice system.'

While jury verdicts must be unanimous, a verdict by judges can by 2-1, Meehan said. A trial is not expected until at least the fall, he said.

Plans: Maren Sanchez, pictured in the dress she had planned to wear to prom, was excited about the dance which was due to attend with her new boyfriend

Detained: Chris Plaskon is being charged with murder as an adult over the stabbing of a girl at his school

Prosecutor Kevin Lawlor said his job 
was to prove the case and that a possible mental health defense was 
irrelevant at this point.

Sanchez, 16, was a member of the National Honor 
Society who was active in drama and other school activities.

The attack occurred hours before the school's junior prom. Police are investigating whether it was related to Sanchez's refusal to be Plaskon's prom date.

She had organized the dance herself and was set to be prom queen, her friends said.

Plaskon's family has said it mourned the loss of life and was struggling to understand what led to the crime.

'This is a very sorrowful, sad youngster,' Meehan said. 'It really is a double tragedy.'

Heartbreaking: Maren was fatally stabbed on Friday morning by a boy who reportedly asked her to prom

A witness saw Plaskon on top of 
Sanchez during the attack and tried unsuccessfully to pull him away, and
 another saw him discard a bloody knife, according to a police 
affidavit.

Plaskon, his clothes bloody, was taken to the principal's office, where an officer arrived and asked what happened. 'I did it. Just arrest me,' Plaskon replied, according to the officer.

Plaskon, who turned 17 last week, is being held on $3 million bond at Manson Youth Institution in Cheshire, where he was placed at a hospital.

He is being prosecuted as an adult and faces up to 60 years in prison with a mandatory minimum of 25 years if found guilty of murder.
