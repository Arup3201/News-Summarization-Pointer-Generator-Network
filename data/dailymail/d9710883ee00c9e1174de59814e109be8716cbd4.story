The Portland teen who made headlines this week for allegedly urinating in a city reservoir - which prompted officials to flush the more than 38 million gallons of supposedly tainted water - has one thing to say: 'I didn't piss in the f***ing water.'

Dallas Swonger, 18, has landed in hot water after surveillance footage shows him urinating near the city-owned reservoir early Wednesday morning.

Swonger admits to urinating near the reservoir, but claims that he did it on a fence next to it, and that none of the urine found its way into the city water supply.

38 million gallons: Swonger's urine prompted water officials in Portland to dump 38 million gallons of water

'Everybody thinks it’s funny and a joke and I’m going to be on the 
news,' Swonger said in an exclusive interview with the website vocative.com. 'It’s no
 f***in’ joke, dude. I don’t want people thinkin’ that Dallas is a dumb 
ass because he pissed in the f***in’ water. In our drinking water. Yeah,
 that’s f***ing awesome. I mean, wouldn’t you be pissed about that?'

The night Swonger admittedly urinated in the city's water supply, he and a few friends were skateboarding in Mount Tabor Park at about 1 a.m. - after the park had closed for the night.

Swonger and his friends can be seen standing by the reservoir in the park. After talking for a few minutes, the three men can be seen walking away from the reservoir.

That, apparently, was when nature called.

'I was like, "Dudes I have to piss so bad,’” Swonger explaine. 'So I just went over to the wall [of the reservoir].

'I leaned up against the wall and pissed on it - right there on the wall, dude. I don’t know else how to describe it.'

Officials from the city's Water Bureau aren't buying Swonger's claim that he urinated on the fence, and not in the reservoir.

'When you see the video, he’s leaning right up because he has to get his 
little wee wee right up to the iron bars,' bureau administrator Davd 
Shaff told the Oregonian. 'There’s really no doubt what he’s doing.'

Officials tested the water on Thursday and it showed no signs of contamination - and, as Swonger points out, animals urinate and defecate in the reservoir all the time and they don't drain the entire reservoir.

Regardless, officials will dump a 'conservative' estimate of 38 million gallons of water - all as cities and states on the West Coast are suffering serious droughts.

Cited: Spronger and his friends were each cited for tresspassing - but he was hit with an additional charge of public urination

'Like, how they can do that?' says Swonger. 'How can they be like, "Yeah, we’re gonna flush all that water." Dude, I’ve seen dead birds in 
there. During the summer time I’ve see hella dead animals in there. Like
 dead squirrels and s**t. I mean, really, dude?'

Swonger and his two friends - identified as Trey McDaniel and Daniel McDonald - were stopped by park officials shortly after Swonger allegedly urinated in the reservoir and cited for trespassing. Swonger was hit with an additional citation for public urination - and the Water Bureau says it plans to push for additional charges against the 18-year-old high school grad.

Swonger isn't the first Oregonian to drop trou and relieve himself in the reservoir.

In 2011, the city dumped 7.8 million gallons of water from the reservoir after another man urinated in it.

According to his buddy McDonald, Swonger is not handling the negative attention he's received in the media very well.

'Dallas is really bummed out about all of it,' 
McDonald told Vocative.com. 'He’s a really good guy 
at heart. He just doesn’t make the best decisions. Honestly, he has the 
potential to do really good.'
