An unrepentant Anders Breivik yesterday defended his killing spree claiming  he would ‘do it again’ given the chance.

In an incredible show of bravado the 33-year-old Norwegian boasted he was responsible for the most ‘sophisticated and spectacular’ attack by a nationalist ‘resistance fighter’ since the Second World War.

But he demanded to be found innocent and insisted he had acted out of ‘goodness and not evil’ when he killed 77 people in gun and bomb attacks last July.

Statement: Breivik pictured approaching the witness stand yesterday so he could make his first testimony in five days of questioning

Salute: For the second day in a row, killer Breivik clenched his his fist in front of him as he entered the Oslo courtroom

Proceedings: Breivik is today set to begin his five-day testimony, which many fear he will use to promote his Islamophobic ideology

Breivik said he was acting ‘in self-defence of my country’ to prevent a civil war and declared: ‘I would have done it again.’

He said he had been inspired by Al 
Qaeda’s use of martyrdom and described his actions as ‘a suicide attack’
 which he had not expected to survive.

In a rambling performance lasting an 
hour and ten minutes the Right-wing anti-Muslim extremist compared 
himself to Native American warriors such as Sitting Bull who had ‘fought
 for indigenous rights’.

Dismissed: Lay judge Thomas Indreboe posted comments online saying Breivik should be executed

He also invoked the late Enoch Powell 
to warn of ‘rivers of blood’ in Europe and mentioned ‘multiculturalism 
in Luton’.

Injured victims and families of the bereaved were at the 
court in Oslo to hear the prepared statement which was not broadcast on 
Norwegian TV.

It was interrupted four times by lawyers or judges to 
hurry him up or, once, because what he said was hurtful to the families.

This was when he compared the 
Norwegian Labour Party’s youth wing group, who were camping on the 
island of Utoya where he  killed 69 youngsters, to the Hitler Youth.

He 
said: ‘The majority of young people were brainwashed and naive, 
indoctrinated by schools or their parents. They were not innocents but 
they actively upheld multicultural values.

‘Many people had leading positions in 
the Labour Party youth wing and were on county boards. They were in many
 ways similar to Hitler Youth at an indoctrination camp.’

In justifying his actions Breivik 
quoted from surveys conducted in Britain about multiculturalism and 
referenced Mr Powell’s infamous 1968 ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in which 
the Tory politician warned of the perceived dangers of greater 
immigration from Commonwealth countries.

Breivik began by describing himself as
 a member of the ‘Norwegian European Resistance Movement’.

He said he 
was a ‘nationalist’ responsible for the most ‘sophisticated and 
spectacular act’ since the Second World War.

He claimed Marxists and liberals had 
brainwashed the young in Norway and Europe by infiltrating schools and 
colleges and said there was ‘now no democracy in Norway’.

Turning to 
Britain he said a recent survey suggested 69 per cent of the population 
see immigration as a ‘major or great problem’.

The red dots indicate the dead on Utoya island while the yellow indicate the wounded. The 2's indicate being wounded twice and the x indicates a victim who later died from the gunshot wounds

He added that another survey in the 
Times in February 2010 had reported that ‘three out of five English 
believe that the UK has become dysfunctional because of 
multiculturalism’.

He said the same views were held by many people in ‘Norway, Sweden, Germany and France’.

Of his actions on July 22 he said: ‘I 
would have done it again because offences against my people – and many 
partisans – are in many ways just as bad.’

Drawing to a close he said: ‘I was 
born and grew up in a conflict zone that is Oslo. The Labour Party 
bought flats in West Oslo and handed them out to Muslims.

Victims: Just some of the 77 killed by Breivik in a day of carnage last year

Muslims want 
autonomy under Sharia law in places like Luton, Paris and Marseille.’

Breivik ended by saying: ‘The attacks 
on July 22 were a preventive strike. I acted in self-defence on behalf 
of my people, my city, my country. I therefore demand to be found 
innocent of the charges.’

Under cross-examination he said: ‘I 
know what happened on July 22 was gruesome – but it was cruel and 
necessary. I was involved in a suicide attack and I did not expect to 
survive the day.’

Eight people died in a bomb attack by 
Breivik in the centre of Oslo. The 69 who died during his gun rampage on
 Utoya the same day were mostly teenagers.

He has said: ‘I admit to the 
acts – but not criminal guilt.’

Terror: Teenagers on the Norwegian holiday island of Utoya had to 'swim for their lives' and hide in trees when Breivik fired indiscriminately at them

● The second day began with the 
dismissal of a lay judge for having said on Facebook that the killer 
should get the death penalty.

It emerged yesterday that the day after 
the massacre Judge Thomas Indrebo posted: ‘The death penalty is the only
 just thing to do in this case.’

He was replaced by a ‘reserve’ on the 
panel of three lay judges and two professionals.
