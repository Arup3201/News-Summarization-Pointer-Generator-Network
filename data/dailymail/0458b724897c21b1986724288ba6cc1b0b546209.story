Police made a gruesome discovery in King, North Carolina on Wednesday, finding a family of four shot to death in what now appears to be a murder-suicide. 

The victims of the shooting have been identified as married couple Coleton and Amanda Tarpley, 35 and 34, and their two sons Charlie, 6, and Coleton, 9. 

It is not yet known which family member carried out that sad act at the home - or for what reason. Stokes County Sheriff Mike Marshall would release no further details on the investigation.

Police found the family dead after receiving a call to conduct a welfare check around 11:50am on Wednesday

Police were originally called to the house on Ralph Boyles Road at 11:50am on Wednesday by the children's grandparents who noticed suspicious activity at the house.

The grandparents said they wanted to pick the kids up from the bus stop, but when they went over to the house, they found the parents' cars unusually parked in the driveway in the middle of the day. 

When they couldn't get through the door, they called police and the officers found the four bodies inside, all with gunshot wounds to the head. 

The children's grandparents wanted to pick them up from the bus stop and called police when the parents' cars were unusually still in the driveway in the middle of the day

Both of the Tarpley children attended Poplar Springs Elementary School, where Charlie (in orange sweatshirt) was enrolled in the special needs program

Both of the Tarpley boys were students at Poplar Springs Elementary School, with younger son Charlie in the special needs program, a spokesman for the school district confirmed. 

Neighbors who spoke with WXII said they didn't recall hearing gunshots. 

Another neighbor who lives across the street told the local Fox affiliate that she never sensed any marital problems and that the couple seemed dedicated to their special-needs son. 

'Coleton revamped the whole inside of the house just to accommodate Charlie, you know; if there was something Charlie needed he would build it for him,' neighbor Amy Parsons said. 

According to Mrs Tarpley's Facebook, she worked as a stay-at-home mom. Despite Charlie's handicap, which appears to have left him wheelchair bound, photos posted to Facebook show the family living an active life - visiting amusement parks, ice skating and socializing at BBQs and other family events. 

The Stokes County Sheriff's Office and State Bureau of Investigation are currently investigating.
