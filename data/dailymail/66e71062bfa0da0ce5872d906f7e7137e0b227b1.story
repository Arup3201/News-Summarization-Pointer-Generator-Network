Dressed in perfectly fitting lingerie and a huge net hair bow burlesque star Dita is the perfect model for her latest range of vintage-inspired underwear.

The petite 40-year-old, who is famous for her love of lingerie, created the Von Follies underwear label in 2012.

Inspired by her own vintage wardrobe (she has been collecting underwear since she was just 16) and love of retro glamour the collection is designed to add some va va voom to real women's wardrobes.

The summer 2013 collection includes 
pretty shades in lace and satin and in the pictures Dita poses 
with ease showing off her favourite items from the 18-piece range.

In
one exclusive new image the brunette is seen showing off a bra, pants 
and garter belt worn with a shiny top hat and towering heels.

In another the showgirl shows off an emerald design as she leans back on an artfully displayed pouffe.

And in keeping with Dita's own aesthetic all of the new designs are available in complete sets with thong, brief, garter belt, bra and slip.

Available at ASOS.com and in Debenhams every design in the range comes in a complete set including thong, brief, garter belt, bra and slip

Dancer Dita admits that she has always been obsessed with lingerie.

In an interview with Vogue.co.uk at the time of the brand's launch she said: 'I
like to surround myself with luxury and beauty all the time. I've been 
collecting vintage lingerie for 25 years - my collection is pretty huge 
now. I've always been fascinated by it, I used to sift through my 
mother's underwear drawer when I was young. I loved the idea of 
something that was feminine and functional.'

Her love of underwear eventually led to a career as a global sex symbol but although the American is famous for showing off her incredible body in nearly nude shows, she recently surprised her fans by admitting that even she gets shy sometimes.

In an interview with Bwatt magazine she explained that of course she has insecurities from time to time.

‘Just like everyone else, I am not always confident, I have all the same self-doubt,' she said.

‘I
just try to love myself and accept things that I don’t like about 
myself and I think it’s something important for all women to know that 
we all have those feelings.’

She
added: ‘Everyone has something about them that they wish they could 
change, everyone I know anyways, and it’s about learning to love those 
things too.’

Last month the stunning brunette danced to a sold out crowd at the House of Blues in Los Angeles during her show, Strip Strip Hooray!

Moving between various stages of dress and undress she wowed her audience in daring ensembles including  a jewel-encrusted bustier and a glittering red corset cinching in her tiny 22-inch waist.
