Ten members of the Government missed the crunch Commons vote on Syria – including two who were chatting nearby.

David Cameron was under pressure to 
sack his Chief Whip Sir George Young after a ‘shambolic’ operation which
saw six ministers, two whips and two ministerial aides miss the vote 
altogether.

They included International 
Development Secretary Justine Greening and  minister for Africa Mark 
Simmonds, who were apparently deep in conversation just yards from the 
Commons chamber while the vote was taking place.

Bruised: David Cameron, pictured leaving Downing Street today, insisted his whips did a 'good job' despite failing to persuade dozens of his own MPs to turn up for the vote

As David Cameron faced the biggest Commons test of his premiership, these are the 10 members of his government who did not vote:

Justine Greening, International Development Secretary, Con

Mark Simmonds, Africa minister, Con

David Gauke, Treasury minister, Con

Alan Duncan, International Development minister, Con

Ken Clarke, minister without portfolio, Con

Steve Webb, Pensions minister, Lib Dem

Mark Hunter, whip, Lib Dem

Jenny Willott, whip, Lib Dem

Tessa Munt, aide to Vince Cable, Lib Dem

Lorely Burt, aide to Danny Alexander, Lib Dem

Other missing senior figures included
minister without portfolio Kenneth Clarke, international development 
minister Alan Duncan, Treasury minister David Gauke and Lib Dem pensions
minister Steve Webb. MPs and ministers voiced astonishment at the 
light-touch handling of the crucial vote by Old Etonian Sir George – 
with one minister describing his approach as ‘pretty complacent’.

William Hague was also facing criticism for allowing Nick Clegg to make the closing speech in Thursday night’s debate.

One Tory MP said: ‘Clegg was hopeless
and ended up getting people’s backs up rather than winning them over. 
If William had done the winding up speech I think some people would have
been won round.’ 

In the aftermath of the vote, one MP 
said: ‘It was just shambolic. People are saying they’ve hardly been 
spoken to, there are a lot of people who are not here. What have the 
whips been doing?’ 

Tory MP Peter Bone, a habitual rebel,
raised eyebrows in the Commons by revealing he had been given no 
instructions about how to vote on Syria.

'I have been under no pressure from 
my Whip to vote one way or the other,’ he said, although he eventually 
voted with the Government. One MP said the first he knew that Parliament
was being recalled was when easyJet sent him a text message offering 
him a flight home. ‘Perhaps the Whips’ Office should just be franchised 
out to easyJet,’ he said.

Pressure: Sir George Young faces being sacked as the Chief Whip after the Prime Minister suffered humiliation in the Commons vote

Shock: The House of Commons was stunned when the result was announced, inflicting an embarrassing defeat on the Prime Minister

Another MP said that although an aide
to the PM had called him, presumably about Syria, he had left no 
message and never called back.

Also among those who missed the vote 
were Lib Dem whips Jenny Willott and Mark Hunter as well as Lib Dem 
parliamentary private secretaries Lorely Burt and Tessa Munt. They were 
among 31 Tory and 14 Lib Dem MPs who missed the vote, despite a 
three-line whip being imposed.

Normally in tight votes MPs are 
ordered back regardless of the difficulty. In past votes, even gravely 
ill MPs have been wheeled into the Commons on trolleys.

Tories: International development minister Alan Duncan, Treasury minister David Gauke and Ken Clarke, minister without portfolio, all missed the vote

Lib Dems: Whips Mark Hunter and Jenny Willott, and pensions minister Steve Webb were also absent

In contrast, Mr Gauke, Mr Duncan and 
Mr Webb are all understood to have been given permission to  continue 
their holidays. Mr Clark was also excused duty, as were the four other 
Lib Dems.

A Number 10 source last night 
defended the absences, adding: ‘There were a number of MPs who did not 
attend the Commons vote either for personal reasons or because the 
logistics were impossible. These arrangements were agreed with the 
Whips’ Office.’ 

Another source pointed out that the 
missing ministers would not have overturned Labour’s majority of 13 on 
the key vote, but added: ‘Could more have been done? Yes it could.’

Alarm: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (left) 
said the Commons vote put the special relationship under 'strain' while 
Chancellor George Osborne warned Britain against turning its back on the
world

Thursday night’s defeat, which is 
without precedent in modern times, piles pressure on the PM to replace 
Sir George, who was brought back from retirement last year following the
resignation of Andrew Mitchell.

Former defence secretary Liam Fox and immigration minister Mark Harper have both been tipped to replace him.

The Lib Dem whipping operation was 
hampered by the fact their chief whip only arrived back from Cameroon on
Wednesday. Many Lib Dems simply ignored the three-line whip, including 
president Tim  Farron who left Parliament shortly before the key vote 
took place.

Clanger: International Development Secretary 
Justine Greening was chatting to foreign office minister Mark Simmonds 
(right) in a small room near the Commons as MPs voted on military action

International Development Secretary  Justine Greening issued a grovelling  apology to David Cameron yesterday after missing the crunch vote because she was lost in conversation in an ‘almost soundproof’ room with another minister.

Miss Greening and Foreign Office  minister Mark Simmonds, were just yards away from the chamber on Thursday night, and had already voted to help defeat a Labour amendment.The pair had apparently ducked into a room for an urgent discussion about Rwanda.

Despite the importance of the debate, the pair somehow contrived to miss the crunch vote in which Labour teamed up with Tory and Liberal Democrat rebels to inflict a humiliating defeat on the Prime Minister.

The pair remonstrated with Speaker John Bercow, arguing that the Division Bell, which alerts MPs to a vote, had not been rung.

But Mr Bercow dismissed their complaint – pointing out there was no requirement for the bell to be rung.

And furious Commons officials yesterday insisted that the deafening bell had been rung in the corridor outside the room where the pair of ministers were chatting inside.

Extensive tests of the system yesterday confirmed it was working properly. 

Hundreds of monitors  displaying Commons business were also tested.

A source close to Miss Greening said she had apologised to Mr Cameron for her ‘deeply unfortunate’ absence, which was ‘clearly embarrassing’.

Asked about their absence, Mr Cameron said: ‘This was a technical issue. 

‘They had made it for the first vote, they were in a room in the House of Commons where they didn’t hear the division bell. They missed the vote.

‘They have apologised profoundly, I have accepted that apology. It wouldn’t have changed the result.’ 

After voting at 10pm, Miss Greening, 44, and Mr Simmonds, 49, had apparently ducked into the little known ‘Reasons Room’ just behind the Commons chamber for a confidential discussion. The next, critical, vote was scheduled for 10.15pm. 

But the pair said the TV monitor displaying Commons business was turned off and they did not hear the division bell outside, or the doorkeepers outside loudly shouting ‘division’ to signal a vote.

Government whips apparently failed to check the room or knock on the door while rounding up MPs to vote.

The Reasons Room was the scene of the famous episode in 1963 when the then Minister for War John Profumo was grilled by fellow MPs over his relationship with Christine Keeler. A House of Commons spokesman said it was a ‘solidly constructed room with a well-fitting door’.

The spokesman also dismissed suggestions the pair could have missed the vote because of a failure of Parliamentary systems designed to alert MPs to votes.

‘Both divisions [votes] proceeded as normal last night, with division bells and the usual audio/visual indications on the hundreds of monitors around the estate.

‘The division bells have been tested this morning and are working correctly.

The Commons spokesman added: ‘There would have been a lot of activity there around those [meeting] rooms.

‘I think it would have been clear that there had been a division on and those involved would have known there was a division on as well.’
