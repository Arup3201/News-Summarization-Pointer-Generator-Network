In the last decade, thousands of British teenagers have celebrated their 'graduation' from secondary school by hiring a limousine to travel to their prom in style. But it seems that they have nothing on their Mexican peers. 

A series of fascinating new photographs highlight a trend in the city of Monterrey for throwing extravagant parties to mark the point at which young girls turn 15 and, according to Latin American tradition, transition into womanhood. 

Sofia, 15, is just one of many teens who marked her coming of age - or 'quinceañera' - by riding in not one, but several, super-bling limos with gaggles of friends, wearing matching suits and party frocks, joining in the fun.

It's my party! Young Sofia, 15, is pictured wearing a flamenco-style cerise dress riding in an open-top SUV-limo hybrid. The glammed-up teen celebrated her quinceañera - transition into womanhood - with a lavish party

Parties to mark a girl's quinceañera have become increasingly lavish with parents splashing out huge sums to ensure their youngster has a party to remember. However, it isn't just 'bank of mum and dad' that pays for the event, other relatives are called upon to 'sponsor' certain elements, for example, the cake or the DJ.

Such is the pomp and ceremony of these excessive bashes, you could be forgiven for thinking that you're looking at a garish wedding party. Even the attending boys go to town, taking care to coordinate their looks with the birthday girl.  

Much like the American prom, the celebrating girl can expect a date, with her betrothed often appearing like a mini-groom, wearing an outfit that has been planned to match hers. 

The birthday cake is likely to be just as eye-catching with 'the bigger, the better' the remit. Other trends include hiring a choreographer to make sure everything from the girl's entrance into the room to her first dance has a professional touch.

Latin American communities in the US take quinceañera just as seriously with many girls incorporating popular films into their dresses. For example, when Disney released the hit film Frozen in 2014, it prompted a surge of Elsa-inspired dresses. At the other end of the spectrum, indigenous tribes in  jungle communities in the likes of Gueatemala would celebrate in a much simpler fashion. 

It's all a far cry from the more humble traditions of quinceañera. According to folklore, in the months before turning 15, a daughter would be taught skills to prepare her for ensuing marriage including cooking, weaving and even tips about how to bring up her own children. It is thought that quinceañera has its roots in  ancient Aztec culture.

15 is the number: Quinceañera is celebrated differently in different countries but is essentially a coming-of-age party

From the Latin American communities of Los Angeles to the streets of Mexico and even in Cuba, when a girl hits the age of 15, a huge party promptly follows. 

Essentially a coming-of-age affair, quinceañera - literally meaning '15 years old', has taken off in much the same way that the high school prom has, with celebrations and outfits becoming increasingly extravagant in recent decades.

In the past, a girl celebrating her quinceañera would be preparing for marriage and offered advice from older females on how best to equip herself for womanhood. Skills considered essential for being a good wife, for example sewing, cooking, cleaning and taking care of infants would be learned.

At her quinceañera, the girl is 'presented' to her community and may be expected to make a speech. 

After an 'acceptance' of the girl, the party-goers would then pray before a meal is served.

Although most historians agree that the celebration has its roots in Aztec culture, how it is celebrated now depends very much on the country the girl grows up in. For many, religion still plays a part and parties are more conservative.
