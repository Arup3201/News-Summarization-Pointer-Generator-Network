Dante D. White is accused of shooting his daughter, 25, while arguing with her boyfriend

A woman was accidentally shot by her father as he took aim at her boyfriend during a row at the family home.

Dante D.White, 49, was arrested after his daughter, 25, was shot in the arm at their St Austin home, Chicago, on Saturday.

White was involved in an argument with 
his daughter's boyfriend and had ordered him to leave the family's home,
Cook County Bond Court said yesterday.

White's daughter was shot as she stepped in between her father and boyfriend, Chicago Police News Affairs Officer told the NY Daily News.

Police were called to the address in St Austin, located on the West Side of Chicago, Illinois, at 2pm on Saturday.

The daughter was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was reported to be in a stable condition.

Another daughter and five of White's grandchildren were also at the property when the incident occurred.

White fled the scene after the shooting but was apprehended by police.

He then led officers to a rubbish bin where he had thrown the .25-calibre gun following the altercation.

It was found to contain two live rounds.

White faces charges of defacing the 
gun's serial number and the unauthorised use of a firearm by a felon, 
having previously been convicted of possession of a controlled 
substance.

Prosecutors told Judge Edward Harmening that they expect to add further charges in the near future.

Chicago police said White is a documented gang member.

He has been remanded in custody pending further inquiries. His bail has been set at $200,000.

Police were called to White's family home on West Quincy Street, South Austin, Chicago, at 2pm on Saturday
