House hunters who fancy living the life of a Bond villain might consider a certain Mayfair apartment that comes complete with a secret room hidden behind a movable wall - that's operated by a switch.

It's all very Hollywood - and you'll need an A-lister's salary to live there, with the landlord of the luxury London flat asking for a whopping £10,000 a week in rent.

For that huge sum tenants will also get two bedrooms, both with en-suite bathrooms, and a huge lounge with views over London's Hyde Park.

The secret room is a study that sits at the end of an enormous living room. It's hidden by an artfully decorated wall that folds and opens up at the flick of a switch.

The fifth-floor flat also has a separate one-bedroom annex suite for a Bond villain's assistant while the apartment also has 24-hour security.

The flat, in Avenfield House, Park Lane, is being advertised by Wetherell Estates with the interior designed by Nicky Haslam.

Peter Wetherell, who is managing the property, said: ‘This magnificent Mayfair apartment makes the perfect pad for a James Bond villain.

‘It has all the James Bond style gadgets including a bookcase wall that with the push of a secret button under the study writing desk opens to reveal a living room hidden behind.

‘There is a master suite which is perfect for Pussy Galore and a separate annex suite for Odd Job.

‘There is also a wine cooler machine, light features in the coffered ceiling and a wow factor entrance hall.’

Swanky: The apartment is in an apartment block similar to the ones shown, in London's Mayfair

Huge demand for luxury properties in 
Mayfair mean prices for the best homes could double to £10,000 per sq/ft
 over the next five to ten years.

This
 will make the famous London village the most expensive place to live in
 the world - knocking nearby Knightsbridge off top spot.

At this price a mega mansion will be 
worth a quarter-of-a-billion pounds while a luxury townhouse will set 
back buyers a cool £100 million.

It
 will mean a bumper payday for the government, which currently taxes 
homeowners 7 per cent in stamp duty on properties bought for more than 
£5 million.

Incredibly, a regular-sized bathroom - which covers around 32 sq/ft - will be worth £320,000.

This
 is twice the average price of a house sold in England and Wales, while 
the best bathroom suites could be worth as much as £5milion.

Knightsbridge
 is currently the top residential area in London thanks to super-posh 
developments like One Hyde Park where flats have sold for in excess of 
£100 million.

But Mayfair, 
famous for once being the most expensive place on the Monopoly board, is
 undergoing its biggest transformation in 100 years.
