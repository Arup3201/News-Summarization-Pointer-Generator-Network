It's 'very likely' Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan will be moved from their Bali jail cells for execution this week, Bali's chief prosecutor says.

Momock Bambang Samiarso says he's only waiting on the green light from Nusakambangan, the jail island where the executions will take place.

There has been no word as yet, but it is 'very likely' to happen this week, he says.

'What we want is the sooner the better,' he told reporters on Monday.

The arrival of fighter jets in Bali has fuelled speculation the Bali Nine pair would be moved soon.

The prosecutor didn't comment on that, but said there would be a meeting on Monday to discuss changes to the plan to transport the men by air.

Meanwhile advisers to Indonesia's President Joko Widodo say he should get the executions of drug offenders over and done with, as pressure builds from overseas. 

Australia has been making strong representations for clemency to Indonesia on behalf of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, sentenced to death in 2006 for the Bali Nine heroin smuggling plot.

An adviser on corruption to Mr Joko, international law lecturer Hikmahanto Juwana, told Indonesia's Metro TV on Sunday that Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff viewed Indonesia as 'easily pressured'.

He argued it would be better for Indonesia to push ahead with the executions before any other foreign 'manoeuvres'.

'If it were me, I'd say just finish the executions,' he said.

Brazil has taken the strongest stance so far, choosing not to accept the credentials of Indonesia's new ambassador, who has now been recalled to Jakarta.

Brazilian drug smuggler Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira was executed last month, reportedly without receiving his last rites.

Pleas for a Brazilian man set for execution this month, Rodrigo Gularte, have gone unheeded, despite evidence he has a severe mental illness.

The transfer of Chan and Sukumaran to the execution site of Nusakambangan island was postponed last week after it was found there weren't enough isolation cells for more than five prisoners.

This comes after the brother of Sukumaran spoke out about of his brother's love for Indonesia as reports emerged that fighter jets had arrived in Bali to escort the two men to their deaths.

Speaking on behalf of his brother outside Kerobokan prison, Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters that both Myuran and Andrew Chan are very grateful to the Indonesian people for their respect and help during their ten years in jail.

'Myu and Andrew love Indonesia, they have a great respect for the Indonesian people and its culture,' Chinthu said. 

'It was through the support of the Indonesian justice system that they were able to help set up many programs that have helped a lot of Indonesians and has also helped better themselves and they are very grateful for that', Mr Sukumaran told Perth Now.

It comes after four Air Force Sukhoi fighter jets were spotted at Bali's Denpasar International Airport. 

It is believed the jets will be used to transfer Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to the prison island of Nusakambangan. 

The presence of the fighter jets only adds fire to speculation that the men may be flown from Denpasar to Nusakambangan in helicopters, instead of taking the traditional route of sailing there.

Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters the family barely speak when they visit Myuran in jail and said he does not need the added strain of seeing his beloved family members crying at the moment.    

'We were all standing around barely talking,' Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters of the morning his family had gathered at the prison to say what they thought were their last goodbyes.

'We were trying to tell each other there was still hope but it just felt like we were lying to each other' he told the Sydney Morning Herald. 

The family had understood the move would 'definitely happen this week.'

Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters that both Myuran and Andrew love Indonesia and the respect they have shown them during their 10 years in prison 

Chinthu Sukumaran said his brother Myuran was comforting his family on Tuesday as they collected his artworks and wept.

'He was trying to be strong,' he told the Herald. 'It was very difficult. For him to stay strong at a time like that, he really didn't need people crying around him.' 

When news reached the Bali Nine pair at midday that their transfer to Nusakambangan 'death' island  would be delayed, Myuran Sukamaran got back to his painting and had something to eat with his loved ones.

'Myuran said he could actually taste the food. That hadn't happened for a long time,' his younger brother told reporters. He also slept for the first time in a long while.   

Indonesian authorities had planned to move Sukumaran and fellow prisoner Andrew Chan to the island at midnight but announced a last-minute delay because of 'technical matters.'

It leaves the men more time to spend with family visiting from Australia, and more time for their lawyers to prepare a legal challenge. The men have been locked-up in Kerobokan prison for almost 10 years for trying to smuggle drugs to Australia.

Despite the delay,  President Joko Widodo has insisted that that their killings will go ahead as planned, telling Indonesian media on Friday that it was the nation's 'legal sovereignty,' and that the postponement was 'only about technical matters'.

Indonesia's Attorney-General H.M. Prasetyo explained that isolation rooms and executions fields on the island were not ready for the pair,The Sydney Morning Herald reported, but said the pair's execution should take place 'the sooner the better.'

The reason was later disputed by officials on Nusakambangan island, following claims that the families of Chan and Sukumaran were entitled to more time with the pair.

Meetings to plan the transfer continued on Friday, but no date has been set.

'As soon as Nusa Kambangan is ready, we'll send them immediately,' Bali chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso told reporters. 

On Thursday, Husain Abdullah, the spokesman for Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, said the execution of the drug smugglers 'will be delayed for between three weeks to a month from now due to technical reasons.' 

Jusuf Kalla took a phone call on Thursday afternoon from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who reportedly thanked his government for delaying the men's transfer to the execution site on Kambangan island. 

The news came after senior government figures expressed concerns Mr Abbott had derailed efforts to save the Bali Nine duo from execution by making comments taken as a 'threat' by Indonesia.

Andrew Chan's and Myuran Sukumaran's families speak to journalists at a press conference in Jakarta last week. Indonesian president Joko Widodo has insisted that that their killings will go ahead.

Ms Bishop has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the lives of Australians Sukumaran and Chan, exercising caution in pointing out problems with Indonesia's legal system while remaining respectful, Fairfax reported.

But on Wednesday, Mr Abbott linked the men's fate to Australia's donation of $1 billion in aid following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed more than 200,000 in Indonesia, and suggested the Asian country should 'reciprocate in this way at this time'.

President Widodo told local media that Ms Bishop had clarified the remarks, speaking directly with Vice-President Jusuf Kalla.

'She has explained that it wasn't the intention. Actually we wanted to say something but since it has been explained, we cancelled it,' said Widodo.

The comments had previously sparked a sharp rebuke from the Indonesian government, with the country's foreign affairs ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, hitting back by saying 'no one responds well to threats'.

Senior members of the Abbott government slammed the prime minister's comments as 'awful'.

'It undid a lot of the good work,' a source told Fairfax 

Ahmad Yuspahruddin, chief of the Indonesian Justice Ministry's Central Java penitentiary division which governs the prisons on Kambangan island told Daily Mail Australia today that preparations were in place to put the two Australians to death by firing squad.

'Nothing problem, everything is okay here,' Mr Yuspahruddin said, 'Whenever the Bali nine duo will be coming we have prepared it for some days ago. We are waiting for them.'

The temporary reprieve gives the condemned men's lawyer, Michael O'Connell, precious time to progress their case.

Mr O'Connell says it's a strong one, but lawyers will first have to clear jurisdictional hurdles to determine whether Mr Joko's decree can be characterised under administrative law or is simply a decision that's a matter for the president. 

Mr O'Connell said the Sydney men were coping extremely well.

'They're humbled really by the depth of support that has been coming from Australia and to some extent in Indonesia as well,' he said on Thursday.

'They are very grateful for it and they simple wait and hope.'
