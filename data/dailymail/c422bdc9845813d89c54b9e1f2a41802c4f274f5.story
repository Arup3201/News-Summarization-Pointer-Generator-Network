In a heart-rending act of animal kindness, a stray dog steps in where no human would and buries a dead puppy by the side of a road.

Onlookers watched in awe as the mongrel circled and sniffed the lifeless pup after finding it in a ditch where it had been left to rot in the midday sun.

But rather than leave it to scavengers, who would inevitably have torn it limb from limb, she spent more than three minutes gently raking sand over the corpse with her snout with extraordinary care.

But there were no sermons, ceremony or quiet reflection at this impromptu canine burial service... not even a bark.

Scroll down for video.

Tender: Onlookers watched in awe as the mongrel came across the lifeless pup in a roadside ditch where it had been left to rot in the sun

Loving care: But rather than leave it to scavengers, who would inevitably have torn it limb from limb, she spent more than three minutes raking sand over the corpse with her snout with painstaking tenderness

Once she is happy that the puppy's body is entirely covered, the black-and-white dog simply turns around and walks silently away.

It was an extraordinary act of respect rarely seen in the animal kingdom and is sure melt hearts across the world.

It is unclear whether she was a grieving mother burying one of her litter or just a passing stranger with a caring heart.

Nor is it clear where the moving scene, captured on a bystander's mobile phone, was filmed but Arabic script on it's YouTube page suggests it may have been made in the Middle East or the Persian Gulf.

Proper job: The mongrel goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure the dead pup is completely covered in sand

Rare sight: Dogs are known to bury bones and toys to come back for later, but it is rare to see a dog burying another dog

Mother or stranger? It is unclear whether the dogs were related or how the puppy died

No ceremony: Once she is sure the puppy's entire body is covered, the black-and-white dog simply turns around and walks silently away

It echoes pictures taken in December of a dog in China standing guard over his dead mate in a busy road where she was mown down by a speeding car.

Those heartbreaking pictures, taken in 
Zhangzhou, in China's Fujian Province, show the animal carefully nudging
the female dog after she was hit and killed by a car.

Vigil: The dog refused to move from her side despite the female lying in the middle of the busy road

Moving: The male tries licking the top of her head as he tries to revive her

After he fails to wake her, the male refuses to leave and stays within feet of his mate for six hours.

The male was seen repeatedly licking 
the face of dead dog and keeping a watchful eye on her as he dodged the 
oncoming traffic. But he never strayed more than a short distance from 
her side.

When he got tired the dog lay down next to her as he kept up his vigil for hours.
