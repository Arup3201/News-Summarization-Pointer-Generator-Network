Reeva Steenkamp's parents rejected £21,000 of 'blood money' from Oscar Pistorius after he shot dead their daughter, a court heard on Tuesday. 

Barry and June Steenkamp also vowed to return 'every cent' of monthly payments - totalling £6,000 - that Pistorius has been depositing into an account since Steenkamp's death.

A probation officer hired by Pistorius's legal team had earlier told the court the athlete's financial gesture was an indication of his grave remorse for taking Steenkamp's life.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said the lump sum payment, raised by the sale of the runner's car, had been immediately rejected by the family, with Mrs Steenkamp insisting she did not want ‘blood money’.

Mr Nel said the couple would also not proceed with any civil action against the track star.

Dup de Bruyn, a lawyer for the Steenkamps, later claimed his clients had received R6,000 (£341) a month for the last 18 months.

He said the payments had now stopped and the money would be repaid.

Mr De Bruyn said he approached the athlete's legal team in the weeks after the model's death to explain that her family were struggling financially because Miss Steenkamp regularly sent money to her cash-strapped parents.

'I conveyed this to Oscar Pistorius's lawyers,' Mr De Bruyn told journalists, adding that the track star began providing monthly support - a fact he was keen to keep private.

The lawyer said Mr and Mrs Steenkamp were now in a position to repay the money - a total of £6,200.

'The Steenkamps don’t want any money and there will be no civil case, they want closure,' Mr De Bruyn said. 

Pistorius's defence team said Mr De Bruyn's version was not accurate and they would give a statement on Wednesday. 

Pistorius' sentence hearing is expected to finish this week. He could face up to 15 years in jail if given the maximum sentence for culpable homicide. Pistorius shot dead Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year.
