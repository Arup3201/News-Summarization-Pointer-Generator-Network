A schoolboy who tried to perform a magic trick he had seen on TV had to be saved by his sister after he choked on a coin.

Gabriel Albright had watched an illusionist put a penny in his mouth and then pull out two moments later and he wanted to do the same himself.

But as he attempted to perform the stunt in front of his eight-year-old sister Minnie the coin got stuck in his throat and blocked his airway.

Lifesaver: Minnie Albright, eight, saved her brother Gabriel when he started choking on a coin as he tried to copy a magic trick that he had seen on television

Minnie, who had life-saving classes in school, immediately stepped in and started beating her younger sibling on the back to dislodge the coin.

Their mother and grandmother were both downstairs in the family home in Pembridge, Herefordshire, completely unaware of the drama that was unfolding.

Despite Gabriel shaking as he
struggled to breathe, she also attempted 
abdominal thrusts and kept her cool until the coin was dislodged.

Minnie was hailed as a lifesaver by the British Heart Foundation today who had run first aid classes in her school.

Her mother Merry, 36, said: 'I am so proud of my daughter. I had no idea that she had learned life saving skills in school, but I am so glad she did.

'If she hadn't been taught what to do, I'd probably only have one child still with us.

Family delight: Minnie Albright (centre with the coin) thumped her brother Gabriel (green t-shirt) on the back to dislodge the coin. Her mother Merry (right), who is married to Ben (left) was downstairs and unaware what was going on

Happy siblings: Minnie Albright knew exactly what to do to help her brother as she had lifesaving classes in school from the British Heart Foundation

'I would have completely panicked if I'd been in the same situation as Minnie was, but luckily, she kept her cool.'

The siblings had been playing upstairs together when Gabriel slipped the penny into his mouth. And when Minnie heard him spluttering, she knew what to do.

Mrs Albright, who runs a family housing business with her husband Ben, 36, said: 'Minnie said she turned round and Gabriel was twitching and his eyes had gone all bulgy and were watering.

'She had a look in his mouth and couldn't see anything, so she started slapping him on the back, then listening to see if he had started breathing again.

'She tried shaking him, and jiggling him about - and after the back slaps, that was enough to dislodge the coin.

'It came shooting out of his mouth and Minnie said he took a huge breath and started crying - it was only then that she thought to call for me.

'She said the only thing she had forgotten to do that she had been taught was shout for help.'

Minnie shouted for her mother, who came running up the stairs, where Gabriel said: 'Minnie saved my life.'

Minnie had been taught the British Heart Foundation's Heartstart course at Pembridge Primary School by her teacher Sarah James, who had recently taken part in Heartstart Instructor Training.

The eight-year old used the technique of back blocks between the shoulder blades of her brother to save his life - just like she had been taught at school.

Mrs Albright added: 'I can't thank the school enough for teaching my daughter these vital skills.

'I hope that by talking about what happened, more schools will think seriously about teaching their children these skills that could save a life.'

She was so impressed by her daughter's quick-thinking after admitting she wouldn't have known what to do to help her son.

Simon Gillespie, Chief Executive at the British Heart Foundation said: 'Minnie was heroic in saving her brother's life and she is a fantastic example of how learning emergency life skills can mean the difference between life and death.

'Sadly many people aren't lucky enough to have someone like Minnie on-hand when their life is in danger, meaning lives are needlessly lost every year.

'The Westminster Government should pay attention to Minnie's story and make Emergency Life Support a compulsory part of the curriculum so every child leaves school with the skills to save a life.

'I'm sure Minnie would say that emergency life support is the most important lesson she has ever learnt.'
