Health officials in Thailand have rushed to reassure men that size isn't everything after a 50-year-old man was forced to have his penis removed following a botched enlargement attempt using olive oil.

The man had used an unproven method of injecting oil into his penis, having been told by friends that it would make it bigger.

The practice, which can also involve bees wax, silicone or even paraffin, is common in Thailand and one Bangkok hospital reports that 40 patients a month receive treatment for side-effects.

This 50-year-old man developed a severe infection after injecting his penis with olive oil over a number of years, reported AFP.

The infection was cancerous and urgent surgery was required to remove his genitals.

'This is the biggest genital surgery we have ever done as we found cancer,' said Sirikul Jiraranaikhajorn, spokeswoman for the Police General Hospital in Bangkok.

She warned men against the procedure, which is carried out at backstreet clinics in the country, saying infections are common.

She added there was no evidence the method caused cancer.

'It only brings bad results - people misunderstand [that is works],' Jiraranaikhajorn added.

'A woman will love a man not because of the size.'
