The match-fixing investigations shaking Spanish football may extend to a match between Malaga and Elche last season involving now Manchester City keeper Willy Caballero.

Caballero is in no way under suspicion and sources close to the investigation have even suggested he may have been one of the players who alerted the Spanish League to possible attempts to rig the game.

Mid-table Malaga were beaten 1-0 by relegation-threatened Elche last April and the game is understood to be one of 13 matches being investigated by the Spanish league - who are desperate to clean up the game - although this has been denied by both clubs.

The Spanish state prosecutor has already interviewed 33 players and directors in connection with a 2011 fixture between Zaragoza and Levante.

And last week Atletico Madrid’s captain Gabi, who was playing for Zaragoza at the time, told the state prosecutor: ‘I did what the club told me to do’ - in reference to an apparent order by then Zaragoza president Agapito Iglesias to give back, in cash, the sum of £67,000 (€85,000) that Agapito had deposited into the midfielder's account in the week leading up to the game.

Agapito claims the money was a bonus to the players but Gabi’s statement to the authorities, which was that bonuses were never paid before matches.

The state prosecutor is investigating claims that Zaragoza’s president deposited money into his own players' accounts then asked them to return it to him in cash.

Levante were Zaragoza’s rivals on the last day of the 2010-2011 season. Zaragoza needed to win the game to stay up and Gabi scored both goals in the 2-1 win that secured safety.

Gabriel Fernandez 'Gabi' was questioned over match-fixing allegations dating back to 2011

The allegations relate to the suggestion that Zaragoza players paid Levante players in cash to throw a match

Levante are also implicated in another suspicious result in the 2012-13 season. This time it was Deportivo who needed the points in a match at Levante’s Cuitat de Valencia stadium. Levante were 3-0 down at half-time and, in the dressing room during the break, midfielder Jose Barkero accused some of his team-mates of deliberately not trying.

He pointed the finger at goalkeeper Gustavo Munua and defenders Sergio Ballesteros, Juanlu and Juanfran in a heated exchange that had to be calmed down by then Levante coach Juan Ignacio Martinez.

Levante lost the game 4-0 and the following day Barkero apologised to his team-mates for the accusation and subsequently gave a press conference in which he said he regretted suggesting that they had deliberately lost the match.

Then Malaga coach Bernd Schuster said his many of his side were 'unrecognisable' when they faced Elche

Authorities are planning to speak to players from that game, and the Malaga match involving Caballero is also under the spotlight. 

After that game, which was lost 1-0 to Elche, Bernd Schuster, the Malaga coach, said: 'I had various players out on the pitch who were completely unrecognisable. We were on the pitch in spirit only.'

The Spanish league has set up a hotline for players to call when their integrity is threatened by the offer to throw matches and 13 games have so far been pinpointed as suspicious. Some of those identified are matches in which one side has nothing to play for and the other is fighting relegation.

But in seven of the games, suspicious betting patterns have been identified as a possible motivation for the result being fixed.

Having heard evidence from those involved in the match between Zaragoza and Levante, the public prosecutor must now decide if the case should go to trial. Both the then Zaragoza president Agapito, and all the players so far questioned, have denied any wrongdoing.
