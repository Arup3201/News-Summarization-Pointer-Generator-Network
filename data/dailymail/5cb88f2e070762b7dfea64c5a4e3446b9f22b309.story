An Apple fan site in China is reporting that the upcoming iPhone 5S will have a dual LED flash designed to improve photos by adding more light to scenes and by making people look more illuminated.

In a video on the same Apple Daily story, a reporter 
is also shown putting what is said to be the case of the low-cost iPhone C inside a bag full of keys, coins, safety clips
 and nails before shaking it.

The case is then removed and its back is shown to the camera to confirm that the plastic cases will be scratch-resistant. Scroll down for video

Reports from advertising industry firm AdAge claims Apple is expected to launch its iTunes Radio streaming-music service in the 
U.S  in September.

It has also claimed that brands such as McDonald's, Pepsi and Nissan will be main advertisers through the service.

Apple's iTunes Radio was announced at its  WWDC event in June and the release was tipped as being sometime in the 'Fall'.

It was initially rumoured to launch at the same time as the company's new iOS 7 software in October.

The site also confirms that the iPhone 5C will be slightly thicker than the current iPhone 5.

Last week rumours emerged that the iPhone 5S will come in black, white and gold.

A
 gold option had first been suggested in May when leaked parts of the 
new iPhone were shown to be markedly different from those in the current
 model.

Techcrunch columnist MG Siegler said he had heard by 'multiple sources' there will be a gold iPhone 5S.

The current iPhone is only available in black and white.

Rumours have additionally claimed that the low-cost version of the iPhone - dubbed iPhone C - will come in a range of colours including blue, yellow, red and green.

Apple is expected to officially unveil its next-generation handsets at an event on the 10 September.

Sources in Asia are said to have confirmed that the new iPhones, rumoured to be announced on 10 September, will be called the iPhone 5S and the iPhone C. The C is said to stand for 'colour' and a number of artists have created concept images of what the plastic handset could look like, pictured

If the rumours are true, the iPhone C will not be the first time Apple has used plastic in its designs.

The early iPhone 3G and 3GS had plastic cases but were susceptible to scratches.

Apple Daily's video suggests this has been fixed and the company will use more durable plastic in future models.

Elsewhere Japan's Nikkei newspaper claims the iPhone 5C and 5S will launch on September 20 in Japan - 10 days after the launch event.

If this is confirmed, it's likely the phone will also launch in major markets such as the U.S and the UK at the same time. 

A Japanese website was among the first to claim that the successor to iPhone 5 will be called the iPhone 5S, and that the low-cost iPhone will be known as the iPhone 5C.

The website Macotakara said that its 
'sources in Asia' confirmed the names and the C in the iPhone 5C is 
thought to stand for 'colour'.

A
 number of leaked pictures show a range of plastic colours and artists, 
including Martin Hajek, have also created concept images of what the phone 
could look like.

Anastyle uses a chemical process called anodisation that creates the desired colour change. Gold is currently one of the most popular after-market colour adjustments for iPhones

Any new handset that is released will run the company's new iOS 7 software that is currently going through beta releases with developers.

The operating system was announced at Apple's WWDC event in June and is expected to officially launch on devices in October.

As well as a complete redesign, iOS 7 will have a new notification centre, a Control Centre that makes it easier to enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, for example, and extra camera features.

Code discovered in the beta released has also hinted that devices running the software may also have fingerprint scanners.
