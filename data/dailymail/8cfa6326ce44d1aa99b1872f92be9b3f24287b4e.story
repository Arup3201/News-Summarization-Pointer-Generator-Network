Parents of a woman brutally murdered were horrified when police handed back their daughter’s jewellery still specked with her blood.

Christine Chambers, 38, died at the hands of her jealous and violent ex-partner David Oakes when he shot her and her two-year-old daughter Shania at their home in Braintree, Essex in June last year.

Ms Chambers’ family were returned a selection of jewellery belonging to Ms Chambers and Shania but police failed to remove all traces of blood left over from the murder.

Oakes, of Steeple, near Maldon, was given two whole-life jail terms after being found guilty of the murders in May this year.

Her sister, Jeannette Chambers, slammed the police for their insensitivity following the family’s horrific ordeal.

She said: ‘My mum and dad have been through enough.

‘They shouldn’t have had to see my sister and niece’s blood on the jewellery returned to them.

‘I don’t think the police have any understanding what a person goes through.

Grieving: Ms Chambers' parents Ken and Jean (pictured during the trial) 'have gone through enough,' Jeanette Chambers said. Jean had to clean the blood off the jewellery herself

‘They should have made sure the jewellery was inspected. My mum had to clean it all herself, then I looked at it last week and there was still blood on it.

‘One earring was dented - the way it was bent you just saw how violent he (Oakes) was towards Christine and how heavy the blows were.

‘It is lovely seeing stuff we have not seen, but we are never going to have her back in our lives again.’

Items returned included two rings, bracelets, necklaces and Shania’s earrings and were handed back in the past few weeks.

Essex Police apologised today for the major blunder.

Blunder: Essex Police had been criticised over the case for their handling of harassment reports toward Ms Chambers by Oakes leading up to the attack in which police tried to negotiate with Oakes while he had Ms Chambers and Shania inside the house

A police spokesman said every effort had been made to clean up the items but accepted mistakes had been made during the cleaning process.

He said: ‘During a family liaison visit, after the return of the jewellery, Jeannette Chambers informed police she had found small traces of blood on one of the items returned.

‘Understandably, she found this discovery very distressing.

‘An immediate apology was provided to Ken and Jean. The apology was accepted and both Jean and Ken were understanding that the officer responsible for the cleaning of the jewellery had done his best.

Murder weapon: The shotgun used by David Oakes to kill his former partner and her two-year-old daughter

‘The delay in returning property was largely due to waiting to see if Oakes would be appealing against his conviction or sentence.’

This is the latest blunder by the force over the crime which was criticised earlier this year for the way it handled reports of harassment towards Ms Chambers in the lead up to her untimely death.

An Independent Police Complaints Commission Report revealed the tragedy may have been avoided if action had been taken earlier to arrest the former nightclub bouncer.

An investigation heard that Oakes 
stormed Ms Chambers’ house and blasted her and their daughter Shania 
with a shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order 
against him.

Worried calls: Ms Chambers (pictured with Shania and her 10-year-old daughter) had made many calls to police in the lead up to the double-murder after her relationship with Oakes ended

'Poorly resourced': Essex Police say they have improved its response to domestic abuse incidents after the deaths of Shania (pictured) and Ms Chambers

The damning report showed how Essex 
Police officers failed to act despite a surge in the number of worried 
phone calls from Ms Chambers in the two months leading up to the 
horrific double killing after they were told her relationship with Oakes
had ended.

Oakes was known to be ‘bullying and controlling’ yet ‘inadequate action’ was taken to arrest him at the earliest opportunity when he breached a non-molestation order. 

The report revealed there had been a catalogue of 16 incidents over two years involving Oakes and Ms Chambers yet they were treated ‘largely in isolation’. 

The investigation said police had failed to realise that Ms Chambers’ fear of Oakes was a potential motivation for her not pursuing complaints against him.

And the IPCC also said Essex Police’s specialist domestic abuse investigation teams were ‘poorly resourced’ with a substantial backlog in inputting domestic violence forms on the force intelligence system. 

Essex Police says it has learnt from the tragic incident and has improved its response to domestic abuse incidents.

At Oakes’ trial, the Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Oakes 'systematically tortured' Ms Chambers for several hours before the killings, forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair.

Ms Chambers' 10-year-old daughter fled the house during the ordeal as police outside attempted to negotiate with the killer.

After shooting Ms Chambers and Shania he shot himself in the face, but survived.
