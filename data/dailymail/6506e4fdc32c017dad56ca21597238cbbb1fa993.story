Arsenal wonderkid Wellington Silva has revealed that he will finally be allowed to play for the Gunners first team, having been granted Spanish citizenship.

The Brazilian winger, who has been labelled the next Neymar, has been unable to play for Arsene Wenger's side since his £3.5million move from Figueirense in 2009 - which was delayed until 2011 due to his age - due to work permit issues.

However, Silva's time spent on loan at Spanish clubs Alcoyano, Ponferradina, Real Murcia and Almeria mean he will now be eligible to play in the UK.

'It's true,' the 21-year-old told reporters when questioned about his Spanish citizenship.

‘I can now go back to Arsenal from next season. I would be very happy if I could become an idol at a club like Arsenal.

‘I will give my best to become a great player.’

He has played in friendlies for Arsenal but was denied his 'Special Talent Visa' in 2011 and therefore his work permit and it was then the Gunners sent him out on loan.

He has played in La Liga and the Segunda Division while in Spain, with the majority of his time spent in the second tier.

He is currently at Almeria, for whom he has played three league matches this season.
