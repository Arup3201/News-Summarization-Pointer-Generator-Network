Tortured: Celeste Fronsman, 29, was found at the side of an Ohio road with visible burns, and the passerby who discovered her moaning could tell she had been raped

A woman was found naked and burned with a rope wrapped around her neck after she was raped and tortured before being left for dead at the side of a rural Ohio road.

Celeste Fronsman was found by a passerby around 8.30am on Sunday who immediately called police after spotting the moaning woman.

'I have a woman right here, she's burned severely, she's been raped and she's been beat up,' the man told the 911 operator.

She was rushed to Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center where she later died.

Local CBS affiliate WBNS reported that the investigation is still underway but police believe that there was a definite motive behind the attack.

'This was not a random act,' Muskinngum County Sheriff Matt Lutz said at a news conference addressing the case.

'There was a vehicle that we were looking for that interested us. We found that last night in the Canton area. There are some people of interest to us that we are currently looking for.'

The names of the potential suspects or the make of their car have not been publicly released.

Police records received by MailOnline show that Ms Fronsman had an extensive criminal history, including a rap sheet with 25 arrests over the past nine years.

Since 2003, she was arrested for a plethora of crimes including prostitution, drug possession and five counts of domestic violence.

Her father told the Columbus Dispatch that he last saw his daughter when she and a friend borrowed his truck, promising to return shortly.

The father, whose name has not been released, said that he contacted authorities that morning.

'This is a vicious animal,' he said of the murderer at large.

'They ought to be taken off the street and put away.'

Evidence: Empty gasoline containers were removed from the scene by investigators

Not a random act: Sheriff Matt Lutz said the crime was the most gruesome he had seen in his career

The sheriff agreed, and the investigation continues as crime scene examiners were seen removing empty gas containers from the dumpsite.

'This is one of the most gruesome things I have ever seen in 23 and a half years in law enforcement,' Mr Lutz said.

'I can't imagine the pain that this lady went through.'
