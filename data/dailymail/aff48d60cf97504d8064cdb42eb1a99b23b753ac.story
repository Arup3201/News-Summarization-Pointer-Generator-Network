Wal-Mart has pulled a batch of powdered baby milk from more than 3,000 of its stores across the U.S. after a newborn boy who was given the formula died from a suspected bacterial infection.

Cans of Enfamil Newborn powder have been withdrawn by the retailer even though the manufacturer claims the batch tested negative for the bacterium before being distributed.

Ten-day old Avery Cornett, from Lebanon, Missouri, died on Sunday after appearing to suffer from an upset stomach.

Little victim: Ten-day-old Avery Cornett from Missouri, here with his big sister Audrey, died on Sunday after taking the milk Enfamil

Hospital tests revealed he had become infected with the rare Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria, which can grow in powdered formula.

A spokesman for Wal-Mart said the company had acted 'out of an abundance of caution' while health officials investigate the death.

Samples of the formula given to the baby were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for testing.

'At this point it has not been determined whether the illness is linked to the formula or an outside source,' a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said.

Cautionary action: Wal-Mart decided to withdraw the product pending an investigation into Avery's death. Here is the Missouri store where Avery's formula was purchased

Public health investigators will also 
look at environmental factors, such as the water used in preparing the 
powdered formula, and at anything else the baby might have ingested.

A spokesman for Mead Johnson Nutrition, 
which produces the formula, said: 'One of the things every batch of 
product is tested for is Cronobacter. We went back and checked on the 
batch in question, and it had tested negative for Cronobacter.'

The government has not ordered a recall of the 12.5-ounce cans of Enfamil Newborn powder with the lot number ZP1K7G. 

Avery was taken to the hospital when he appeared lethargic and appeared to have an upset stomach

The Lebanon Daily Record reported that
Avery was taken to St. John's Hospital-Lebanon late last week after 
appearing lethargic and displaying what his family said were signs of a 
stomach ache.

He was later moved to St. John's 
Hospital-Springfield, and preliminary tests showed that he had 
contracted a rare bacterial infection, Cronobacter sakazakii, the 
newspaper reported. 

He died Sunday after being removed from life support.

A spokesman for the company that makes the formula says all products are tested for Cronobacter, and follow up tests on the batch fed to Avery tested negative

Avery had been fed Enfamil Newborn 
powder bought at a Walmart store in Lebanon which stopped selling 
the product after learning of his death.

The Missouri Department of Health 
advises parents to follow World Health Organization guidelines for 
safely preparing powdered infant formula, Terlizzi said.

'This includes washing your hands 
with soap and water, thoroughly sterilizing all feeding equipment in 
hot, soapy water and preparing enough formula for only one feeding at a 
time,' she said.

Funeral services for Avery are planned for Thursday evening, according to Jack Parscale of Holman Howe Funeral Home in Lebanon.
