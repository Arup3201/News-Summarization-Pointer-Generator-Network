Prime Minister Tony Abbott has announced that Australian special forces are moving into Iraq, two months after they were deployed to the Middle East.

In a meeting with US President Barack Obama in Beijing Mr Abbott told Mr Obama that as hurdles with the Iraqi Government had been dealt with Australia can begin an 'advise and assist' mission.

The US president said that the fight against Islamic State militants has progressed into new territory and he needs nations like Australian on his side, News.com.au reported.

The decision comes on the back of an announcement by the US to send 1500 more troops into the area.

The pair had a one-on-one meeting at the APEC summit in Beijing, China, on Monday 

The discussion took place as part of a long one-on-one meeting at the APEC summit between the two leaders, and Mr Obama told reporters after the meeting the campaign in the Middle East had shifted to building up Iraqi security forces, rather than fighting IS.

'As we are setting that up, I am having conversations with Australia and other coalition partners that are already committed to putting trainers in to see how they can supplement and work with us in this overall effort,' he said. 

Mr Abbott responded to the President's comments saying it was crucial that coalition forces take a strong stance, before branding IS a menace to the world.

'It is important to respond strongly, which is what the US-led coalition is doing,' the Prime Minister said.

Mr Obama said the fight against IS militants had moved into a new territory and the focus would be on building up Iraqi security forces

But he would not confirm whether more troops would be deployed, but instead said that the priority was getting special forces into Baghdad.

SBS reported that the special forces will be armed, but will only be allowed to use their weapons in self-defence. 

Pictures taken after the meeting when the pair addressed the media show the leaders sharing a joke, laughing as the sit against the backdrop of their respective nation's flags. 

The upcoming G20 summit in Brisbane and regional trade were also on the table in the meeting between Mr Abbott and Mr Obama.

In the coming days Mr Abbott will briefly cross paths with Russian President Vladimir Putin and is expected to have 'very robust' talks with the leader about the MH17 tragedy.

'The conversation will be, as I have said, about our absolute expectation that Russia will be as good as its word, that it will fully cooperate with the investigations that are under way and that it will do what it can to ensure that justice is done,' Mr Abbott said on Saturday.

'This is not an issue which Russia now expects to be forgotten, that this is not an atrocity which Russia thinks can be swept under the carpet'.
