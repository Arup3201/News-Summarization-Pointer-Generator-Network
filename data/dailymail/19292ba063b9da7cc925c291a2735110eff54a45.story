Louis van Gaal is putting his faith in German talent with his summer transfer targets – but should he be looking elsewhere?

In terms of medals won by Premier League imports, German players have just 20, less than the likes of Serbia and Norway, and 83 less than runaway leaders France.

The French boast 45 Premier League medals thanks to the efforts of the likes of Patrice Evra, Eric Cantona and Patrick Vieira.

Forward planning: New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal wants to sign German duo Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mats Hummels

Success story: Hummels (front) has won trophies with Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga

German imports have just four – and two of those belong to Robert Huth - with Michael Ballack and Jens Lehmann also contributing.

Incoming Manchester United boss Van Gaal is chasing Germany’s World Cup duo of Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mats Hummels but might do better to look elsewhere, judging by the medals table.

Players coming to the Premier League from so-called lesser countries, including Ireland, Wales, Norway and Serbia have all performed better in trophy-terms.

And the Germans haven’t performed much better in England’s two major cup competitions either.

Just seven can claim to be FA Cup winners, while six have won the League Cup. Only Ballack is able to boast a clean sweep of all three English domestic trophies from his time at Chelsea.

Boost: German trio Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski won the FA Cup with Arsenal last month

Natural winners: French stars, including former Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira, have won 103 medals in England

And the table could have looked even worse had Frenchman Lauren Koscielny and Welshman Aaron Ramsey not dug Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski out of a hole at Wembley in May with their game-deciding goals Arsenal's FA Cup final victory.

According to past successes, Van Gaal might be better of following the Alan Pardew route and investing in French talent.

Porto’s French centre-back Eliaquim Mangala has been heavily linked with United and rivals Manchester City, and he could add to his nation’s impressive medal haul if he moves to the Premier League.
