This year’s Black Friday is on course to become the biggest on record as millions of shoppers scramble to get their hands on bargains.

A staggering 152 million people are predicted to shop over the weekend, up 10 per cent on last year, according to the National Retail Federation.

With consumer spending accounting for 70 per cent of the U.S. economy, it comes as a much-needed lifeline for the country's ailing finances - and signals good news for shops in the run up to Christmas.

And even the generous estimate by the NRF is expected to fall short, according to a spokesperson.

Black Friday online sales across the U.S were up 20 per cent, according to IBM. And Thanksgiving Day saw a 39 per cent rise in internet retail revenue.

Last year, the organisation estimated there would be 138 million shoppers over the weekend – but 212 million showed up.

Consulting firm Customer Growth Partners predicts sales in the first 24 hours of Black Friday may grow to $27 billion.

This is an eight per cent increase from the same period a year ago.

Analysts suggested the surge could be driven by the new trend of shops opening on Thursday. Walmart joined KMart and Toys R Us to open on Thanksgiving.

They were closely followed by Target, Best Buy, Macy’s and Kohl’s, whose doors opened at midnight for the first time.

‘Black
 Friday will be strong because so many stores are opening Thursday and 
that gives consumers at least six more hours to shop,’ Candace Corlett 
of WSL Strategic Retail, a New York-based consulting firm, told CNN.

Early start: Analysts believe the increase could be thanks to shops opening on Thursday for the first time. Toys R Us opened at 9pm on Thanksgiving Day in a bid to entice early shoppers, as did Walmart

Determined: Other shops, including Target, pictured, opened at midnight. Macy's, Kohl's and Best Buy also opened at 12. As is the case every year, some shoppers camped outside stores for days to be the first inside

‘It will also attract people who may be willing to go out Thursday night, but aren't about to get up early Friday morning.’

Amanda Rottmueller, a 20-year-old nursing student, told Bloomberg she was drawn to the Black Friday sales for the first time due to the new nighttime openings.

‘I’m out tonight to buy stuff that I need,’ Rottmueller said at the Tri-County Mall in Cincinnati after purchasing discounted bras and pjamas.

‘The deal is just too good, and I can get something really nice I wouldn’t be able to afford otherwise.’

Analysts also predicted low consumer confidence was encouraging stores to add more discounts, leading to a boost in sales.

LCD TV prices are expected to hit an 
all-time low this Black Friday, according to DisplaySearch.

Retailers are also increasing the number of Black Friday deals offered online between now and Monday.

As they fend off frantic shoppers, stores around the country agree they have seen more shoppers than any previous year.

About 15,000 people waited for the 
midnight opening of the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, 
almost doubling last year’s line, spokesman Dan Jasper told Bloomberg.

Black Friday visitors at the largest mall in the country may reach a record 200,000, about seven per cent more than last year, he said.

Nine of out 10 Michigan retailers 
expect the season to be at least as good as last year, according to the 
Michigan Retailers Association. The state's merchants are forecasting an
 average gain of 6 per cent for the holidays.

Seok Chung, marketing 
director  at the Partridge Creek Mall in Clinton, Michigan, said: ‘We're cautiously optimistic this 
could be one of our biggest Black Fridays.'

Increase: The National Retail Federation predicts 152 million will shop this weekend, up 10 per cent on 2010

Boom: Sales in the first 24 hours of Black Friday are predicted to reach $27 billion, up eight per cent on 2010

The forecasts reflect shoppers’ resilience so far this year.

Consumer spending, which accounts for
 about 70 per cent of the U.S. economy, increased for 16 consecutive 
months up to October as the economy added jobs and avoided slipping into
 another recession.

It comes despite Occupy Wall Street’s attempts to quell shoppers ‘to send an economic message to big business and banks that profits over consumers is not good business’.

‘I don't think it's going to have any impact on consumer spending for Christmas,’ Britt Beemer, retail analyst and chairman of America's Research Group, told CNN. ‘Unless protestors happen to be blocking the entrance of a store.’
