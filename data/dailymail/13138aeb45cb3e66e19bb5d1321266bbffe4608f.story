A man has handed himself in almost 12 hours after allegedly running from the scene of a fatal car accident during a police chase northwest of Melbourne.

Police were responding to reports that three men and a woman wearing balaclavas were allegedly trying to rob a ticket machine at Macedon railway station, about 70km from Melbourne, just before 5am on Saturday.

The four people took off in a sedan and police gave chase but a short time later, officers found the car had rolled on a nearby bend.

A man has handed himself in almost 12 hours after allegedly running from the scene of a fatal car accident during a police chase northwest of Melbourne

One man was killed after being ejected from the vehicle and police saw two men fleeing into dense bush, Nine News reports.

Police arrested a 27-year-old Sunbury woman at the scene and she is under police guard at Royal Melbourne Hospital.

'The fact they left their friends, one dead and one injured, and fled off into the bush probably speaks volumes about their character,' Assistant Commissioner Jack Blayney said of the two men who fled.

A Sunbury man, 30, was later arrested on a roadside at nearby Gisborne about 9.45am on Saturday. He had minor injuries and remains in police custody.

But police were still looking for the second man until Saturday evening when a 32-year-old from Diggers Rest showed up at Gisborne Police Station.

He was being held for questioning.

Investigators believe the car lost control in wet conditions and clipped a tree.

'If the police are indicating to people that they should pull over, they should pull over. It's not worth risking your life, the life of your friends, the life of innocent members of the public and also the lives of police officers for such trivial matters,' Blayney said.
