Parents are allegedly using ice to pay their teenage babysitters in the Northern Territory, as the drug problem in Australia's top end continues to worsen, according to a new report.

Allegedly, the prevalence of methamphetamine use, more commonly known as ice, is now so severe in Darwin and Palmerston that youths are reportedly babysitting and prostituting themselves in exchange for the drug, according to The NT News. 

Authorities are now referring to the abuse of ice in the Northern Territory as an 'epidemic'.

A shocking report by Australian Crime Commission has revealed that children as young as 11 are starting to experiment with the hard drug.

Ice use has escalated at an alarming rate amongst 15 and 16 year olds over the last six months, according to Catholiccare – Northern Territory's only service focussed on targeting drug abuse in young people.

'Addiction to ice is placing young women in vulnerable situations and leaving them open to exploitation, further the easy accessibility of ice means that it is used as a form of currency,' Ms Lloyd said.'Catholiccare's NT Director Jane Lloyd told The NT News.

However, the federal funding is scheduled to stop for Catholiccare on June 30.

Ms Lloyd partially blames the widespread use of ice on the affordability of the drug.

She also labels ice 'the drug of curiosity' amongst young people and the problem is a result of experimentation resulting in addiction and abuse.

As a result of the surge in hard drug use, crime is also beginning to escalate in the region, according to Catholiccare.

Authorities are now referring to Ice use in the Northern Territory as an 'epidemic'. It is popular in struggling areas because it is so cheap but has been found to lead to a rise in crime

'It has been used as a tool – kids are easily manipulated and used in many ways and ice is one of many tools that is being used,' Catholic Care NT's Alcohol and Drug urban team leader Yianna Paterakis told NT News.

A new Australian Crime Commission (ACC) report has revealed that ice poses the greatest risk to users and the wider community.

Two weeks ago, a parliamentary committee was formed to crack down on the ice epidemic in the Northern Territory.

Chief Minister Adam Giles confirmed that 'this committee will be tasked with looking at all the evidence and determining if there are ways we could be responding better to this issue.'

The focus will be on determining the extent of the problem and evaluating the current programs in place to target drug use.
