Harry Kane is confident Tottenham Hotspur can reverse their dreadful form against the ‘big clubs’, starting with back-to-back matches against Manchester United and Chelsea.

Kane, who scored his 15th goal of the season against Leicester on Boxing Day, claims Mauricio Pochettino has given his side the belief they can mix it with the best.

‘Previously we were beaten mentally before we stepped out on the pitch because we were up against a bigger named team,’ said Kane. ‘That isn’t the case anymore.’

Since the start of 2012 Tottenham have played 26 games against Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, the teams that finished in the top four last season, and have lost 18. This includes heavy defeats to Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea this campaign.

But striker Kane insists that Spurs’ run of four victories in a row has led to a surge of positivity in the dressing room.

‘We need to go into these games believing we can win,’ said Kane. ‘We haven’t done it in the past few years. It is something that has to change and I think it already is.

‘We’re confident at the moment. These are going to be tough games but we’re ready for it and going for three points. Mauricio has built confidence and belief.

‘The lads have taken to his philosophy well and there are no better games to show that than big games at home.’

Spurs have been incredibly poor defensively against the big clubs, conceding 72 goals in those 26 fixtures. ‘The defensive line is important,’ said Pochettino. ‘We hope we can fix this problem.’

Hugo Lloris who, along with David de Gea, has been the Premier League’s outstanding keeper this season, made two crucial saves against Leicester.

‘He’s one of the best keepers in the world, without a doubt,’ said Kane. ‘You don’t become France keeper and captain without being the very best. He definitely saved us against Leicester and in other games. I’m happy to have him behind us.’
