Javier Hernandez was put through his paces for the first time as a Real Madrid player as he trained alone at the club's Valdebebas training ground on Tuesday.

The Mexican striker looked to be in good shape as he went through some rigorous exercises with a Madrid fitness coach.

Hernandez will be hoping to keep fit during the international break after being left out of Mexico coach Miguel Herrera’s first post-Brazil 2014 squad.

Deadline: The Mexican striker signed a season-long loan deal from Manchester United on Monday

On Monday, Hernandez completed the loan move to Real Madrid with the possibility of making the transfer from Manchester United permanent next summer.

United stand to rake in £17million if the deal  becomes permanent, but the original season-long loan agreement will see manager Louis van Gaal make £1.5m for the out-of-favour striker. 

The Old Trafford side confirmed the news on their Twitter feed on Monday afternoon.

Hernandez, who will wear the No 14 shirt at the Bernabeu, expressed his delight at the move when speaking at a press conference unveiling his signing saying: 'To wear this jersey is a dream come true for any player in the world.

'One knows what this club represents. I am delighted to be here.

'It really motivates you when you know that a big club has wanted you. The only thing on my mind is to help this club.

'I am here to give my contribution in order for the club to continue to win titles. I want to thank Real Madrid for giving me this opportunity.

'I'm going to do my best mentally, physically, in order to help this team improve.

'It's an honour and a dream to play in this team. Of course, I have aims, dreams and I'm going to go out on the pitch determined to enjoy this experience. 

'In my head and in my heart I am only grateful for being a part of this great team.'

Real, who lost 4-2 to Real Sociedad in La Liga on Sunday night after selling Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso,  relinquished the fight for Monaco forward Radamel Falcao to United on Monday.

Real manager Carlo Ancelotti kept quiet about the move for 26-year-old Hernandez after the loss, but conceded that his side needed to change after letting a two-goal lead slip. 

'This defeat changes nothing regarding the transfer market,' Ancelotti insisted. 

'It's our problem, of concentration. We have to work much harder not to make these mistakes. Something has to change and it's going to change.'
