Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius maneuvered one of America's richest liberal philanthropies into contributing $13 million to Enroll America, a group founded by a former Obama White House staffer to drive up insurance enrollment numbers under the Affordable Care Act.

A report issued Monday by the Government Accountability Office shows what Republican members of Congress ave anticipated learning since 2013: that Sebelius called a total of five organizations a year ago and urged them to help Enroll America reach its goals.

One call went to the CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which made $3 million and $10 grants to the group after hearing her request. That amount was a dramatic increase from the $150,000 it had contributed the previous year.

The foundation, known for bankrolling gun-control, diet-control, anti-alcohol and anti-tobacco campaigns, improbably insists that that the decision to award the money was 'not made in response to the Secretary's call.'

Sebelius also asked the tax-preparation giant H&R Block for funds, but that company decided against giving.

Three more calls from Sebelius went to Kaiser Permanente, Ascension Health and Johnson & Johnson – all companies HHS regulates.

The independent GAO report concluded that Sebelius sought 'nonfinancial support' from them for Enroll America, 'such as technical assistance.'

Texas Sen. John Cornyn told MailOnline that 'Kathleen Sebelius' shake-down of the very health companies her department regulates is a gross abuse of government power.'

'After putting taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in Obamacare spending,' said the hard-charging Republican, 'a full investigation is needed to account for all the money wasted and the need to fundraise from the health industry.'

Others in the GOP had equally harsh words.

'I have said all along that Obamacare is a complete disaster,' Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar told MailOnline. 'Now we learn it’s so bad that Secretary Sebelius attempted to solicit donations from an industry that her department is supposed to regulate in order to persuade folks to sign up.'

Gosar pointed to Obamacare alternatives like the American Health Care Reform Act, a GOP-sponsored alternative plan that he called 'patient-centered' and 'market-based.'

'The evidence couldn’t be more clear that Obamacare just doesn’t work,' he said.

Tennessee GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander's office was more biting, with spokesman Jim Jeffires writing that his boss 'hopes that the next Secretary of HHS will not ask the entities she regulates to support the president’s allies.'

Sebelius is on her way out after a lackluster Obamacare program launch and a series of missteps that included meltdowns in front of congressional committees. Her successor, current White House budget chief Sylvia Mathews Burwell, is expected to be confirmed in May.

But Sebelius has clung to the assertion that she has always had the legal authority to ask for donations to outside groups that support President Obama's agenda.

'Obamacare is a complete disaster,' said Arizona GOP Rep. Paul Gosar, complaining that Sebelius had to 'solicit donations from an industry that her department is supposed to regulate in order to persuade folks to sign up'

Sebelius' tenure at HHS was marked by flailing performances before Congress and a tendency to underperform in her role as Obamacare's quarterback.

HHS's Office of General Counsel told Sebelius in February 2013, GAO wrote, that she was permitted to 'encourage members of the public to support certain organizations assisting Americans to enroll' in Obamacare coverage.

The written legal advice, which stopped short of saying she had the authority to pressure corporations or private foundations, came after her call with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Sebelius dismissed the idea last year that she was shaking down organizations to help a politically favored nonprofit.

'If they felt pressure, they misunderstood,' she told a House Committee on Education & The Workforce hearing in June 2013, according to the Post. 'I can't answer what they felt.'

She also insisted that she 'could legally solicit funds from anybody regulated by our office,' but claimed – in contradiction to Monday's report – that 'I chose not to do that.'

In 2013 HHS officials told Congress that Sebelius was the only federal government employee to solicit money for Enroll America.

But according to Monday's GAO report, White House Deputy Assistant for Health Policy Jeanne Lambrew teed up the conversation for Sebelius with a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation employee in 2012.

GAO reported that the foundation said Lambrew 'estimated that Enroll America or other similar national enrollment organizations would likely need about $30 million to finance a national outreach effort' for Obamacare enrollment.

'RWJF told us that the official also indicated a hope that RWJF would provide a significant financial contribution to support such efforts,' but did not name a specific price tag.

Months later, with the Obama administration's permission, the foundation's CEO announced the $10 million grant to Enroll America during a White House meeting of liberal foundation executives.'

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation also committed more than $834,000 in 2010 and 2011 to create Enroll America, which spun off from the progressive Families USA Foundation.

In 2012 White House Office of Public Engagement deputy director Anne Filipic left the administration to become Enroll America's president. She was previously the deputy executive director at the Democratic National Committee.

It's this sort of revolving-door politics, practiced on both sides of the aisle, that has Republican lawmakers steamed.

'The conflict of interest is hard to avoid,' said Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, addressing Sebelius' approach of companies she was in charge of regulating.

'Our
government and government officials should be held to a higher standard than
this, and the American people deserve better.'
