But when bailiffs arrived with bolt-cutters yesterday, Chrissie Hynde’s daughter stood little chance.

Natalie Hynde, whose mother is the lead singer of the Pretenders, was arrested by police on suspicion of trespassing after tree-climbing experts pulled her down from her perch.

Arrest: Natalie Hynde is led away from the trees by bailiffs who arrived at the protest in East Sussex today

The 28-year-old, whose mother is the 
lead singer of the Pretenders, had spent weeks in a snow-covered 
treehouse 15ft off the ground to try to prevent the development tearing 
through a beauty spot.

And on Monday night she bolted herself to a branch some 40ft off the ground in anticipation of a visit by bailiffs.

However, the enforcement officers used
bolt cutters to free her before lowering her to the ground in a plastic
body bag yesterday afternoon.

Miss Hynde, whose father is Ray Davies of The Kinks, was then given a medical check-up before being arrested.

She has said her decision to join the 
protest group was in part because of the ‘inspiration’ of her mother, 
who was arrested in 2000 for protesting about animal rights outside a 
New York branch of the Gap clothing chain.

Environmentalist: Natalie Hynde moved to nearby St Leonards-On-Sea last year before she joined the protestors at Combe Haven Valley

Action: Miss Hynde has to be cut down from the tree after she bolted herself to a branch to try and prevent land clearing for the construction of a by-pass in the Combe Haven valley at Crowhurst near Hastings

Refusing: Miss Hyde had to be winched down before she was arrested for trespassing

Determined: Once on the ground Miss Hyde did not go willingly

Miss Hynde moved to St Leonards-On-Sea
in East Sussex last year, and joined protesters trying to protect the 
nearby Combe Haven Valley beauty spot just after Christmas.

Developers plan to build a link road 
that will connect Bexhill with Hastings, concreting over a swathe of 
ancient forest and rolling farmland in the process.

Gabriel Carlyle, of the protest group Combe Haven Defenders, said: ‘I’m sure Natalie’s mother will be very proud of her.

‘She has been part of the protest group who have had to endure terrible weather conditions.

‘On Monday night she bolted herself onto the tree because she knew the bailiffs were coming the following day.'

Cut down: Before her arrest Miss Hynde had spent the night 40ft up in a tree as a way of preventing the bailiffs from removing her

Not giving in: Miss Hynde appears to have laid down on metal barriers to prevent bailiffs from cordoning off the area

In vain: Miss Hyde is seen talking to bailiffs after she was forcibly removed from the tree which she had bolted herself to late Monday night

‘She had to cope with driving rain and
winds of 44mph. She was 40ft above the ground and away from her food 
and provisions.’

Mr Carlisle, 38, of St Leonards-On-Sea, added: ‘Some of
the protesters were so cold that they couldn’t physically climb down by
themselves. They had to be winched down.’

Yesterday police also 
arrested a 29-year-old man from Leeds and a 54-year-old Hastings man.

All three were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass and obstruction of a High Court official.

Campaigners say 26 protesters have been arrested since they set up camp on December 14.

Family tradition: Natalie said her decision to join the protest, left, was inspired by her mother Chrissy, right, who was arrested in 2000 during an animal rights protest in New York

Last night six protesters were still thought to be attached to trees in the woods.

Before her arrest Miss Hynde said her 61-year-old mother was ‘delighted’ to see her taking a stand.

‘She’s my mother so of course she’s anxious about my health and worried that I’m keeping warm enough,’ she said.

‘She’s concerned about things like 
pneumonia, because it is bitterly cold. But she’s confident that I know 
what I’m doing and sensible. She knows that we all take very good 
precautions to make sure we stay healthy.

‘She’s been a great influence on me, 
and one of the reasons we are so opposed to this road is because of the 
impact it will have on animals in the area.'

Fighter: Miss Hynde and fellow protestors say the construction of the road will destroy the unspoilt Combe Haven Valley

No-frills: Natalie Hynde spent several weeks in the makeshift camp before eviction day today

Plan: The proposed route of the new road between Bexhill and Hastings

Ms Hynde added: ‘This is a wildlife haven and the road will destroy much of that. My main concern is climate change and
the increased damage this will do to the planet by increasing 
emissions.’

Many of those taking part in the protest are in their 50s 
and 60s and choosing to take up activism rather than wind down to 
retirement.

Miss Hynde’s fellow protesters 
included 58-year-old grandmother Hilda Stewart and Simon ‘Sitting Bull’ 
Medhurst, who dug a tunnel underneath the road building site in a bid to
stop the development.

Many observers say the Combe Haven 
Valley fight has rekindled memories of the ‘tree people’ of the 1990s, 
when dreadlocked protester Daniel Hooper - known as ‘Swampy’ - briefly 
became a minor national celebrity.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
