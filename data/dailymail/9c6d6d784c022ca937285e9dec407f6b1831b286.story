A two-year-old girl was shot to death by Syrian soldiers to prevent her from growing up to be a demonstrator, a United Nations probe said today.

The toddler was one of hundreds of children who have been murdered by troops since the government in March started a crackdown on the protest movement that has swept through the Middle-East.

As of early November, government forces have killed at least 256 children and committed other 'crimes against humanity', according to  the report by a panel of independent experts.

A giant portrait of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is carried in a sea of thousands of pro-government demonstrators in Damascus today. A UN report today claimed government forces have killed at least 256 children and committed other 'crimes against humanity'

The study said that men and boys have been sexually tortured at military detention facilities.

'Torture was applied equally to adults and children,' said the panel's report to the UN Human Rights Council.

Among its details were that 'numerous testimonies indicated that boys were subjected to sexual torture in places of detention in front of adult men.'

The panel said government forces used excessive force to 'shoot indiscriminately at unarmed protesters' while snipers targeted others in the upper body and head.

It found Syrian security forces cooperating with militias were given 'shoot to kill' orders to crush demonstrations.

Paulo Pinheiro, a Brazilian professor and the panel's chairman, said: 'These crimes include murder, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence. We have a very solid body of evidence.'

The panel's members and staff weren't 
allowed into Syria. But the commission said that it had interviewed 223 
victims and witnesses, including defectors from Syria's military and 
security forces, since September.

The UN Human Rights Council appointed Mr Pinheiro, Turkish women's rights expert Yakin Erturk and Karen Abu Zayd, a U.S. citizen and former head of UNRWA, the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees to lead an international investigation of allegations of human rights abuses in Syria.

The commission was asked to follow up on a report from the UN human rights office that crimes against humanity may have occurred during Syria's crackdown against anti-government protesters, and to find those responsible.

Among the other findings listed in the report:

The report came out as it today emerged Russia is sending a flotilla of warships to its naval base in Syria in a show of force which suggests Moscow is willing to defend its interests in the strife-torn country.

Arab League sanctions and French calls for the establishment of humanitarian zones in Syria have increased international pressure on Assad to end bloodshed that the UN said has killed 3,500 people during nine months of protests against his rule.

Russia, which has a naval maintenance base in Syria and whose weapons trade with Damascus is worth millions of dollars annually, joined China last month to veto a Western-backed UN Security Council resolution condemning Assad’s government.

Izvestia newspaper today reported, citing retired Russian Admiral Viktor Kravchenko, that Russia plans to send its flagship aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, along with a patrol ship, an anti-submarine craft and other vessels

Admiral Kravchenko said: 'Having any military force apart from Nato is very beneficial for the region as it prevents the outbreak of armed conflict.'              

A navy spokesman quoted by the newspaper confirmed that the Russian warships would head to the maintenance base Russia keeps on the Syrian coast near Tartus but said the trip had nothing to do with the uprising against Assad.

The paper said the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier would be armed with at least eight Sukhoi-33 fighters, several MiG-29K fighters and two helicopters.

It will also have cruise and surface to air missiles, the paper said.

Yegor Engelhart, an analyst with Moscow-based defence think-tank CAST, said Moscow did not want its position to be ignored while the Assad government was under pressure.           

'At the very least Moscow wants to show that it is willing to defend its interests in Syria,' he said.

On April 25, in Dar'a, dozens of conscripts who fired into the air rather than follow an order to shoot directly at people's homes were themselves killed by security forces posted behind them

The injured people taken to military hospitals were beaten and tortured during interrogation. In Homs, they suffered at the hands of security forces dressed as doctors allegedly with the 'complicity' of real medical personnel

Arbitrary arrests and unlawful detentions were widespread. Most of those arrested were blindfolded and handcuffed and denied food or medical help. Thousands more may have been abducted and disappeared.
