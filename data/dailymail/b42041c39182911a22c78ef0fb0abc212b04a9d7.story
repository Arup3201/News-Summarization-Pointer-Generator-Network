A former Chanel model has been told to lose weight if she wants to keep her career.

Lilah Parsons, 25, claims her agency Models 1 insisted she shed pounds if she wanted to be considered for jobs.

Parsons, who has a respectable stint with Vivienne Westwood under her belt,  gave up modelling full-time after securing a job presenting for MTV.

Today she spoke of the pressure to stay slim within the industry, and announced she is going on a strict, £236.35 Nosh juice fast and joining the gym in order to lose weight.

Parsons is listed as having a 26-inch waist and 37-inch hips on the Models 1 website, a slim size 10. But she says she has put on a little weight recently, and drifted up to a size 10-12.

After being given the news by her agency, Parsons signed up for membership at Virgin Active, as confirmed with Max Clifford Associates, who represents her TV work.

She has also bought a Nosh juice diet package and confirms she will be starting her strict no-solid menu regime week.

Lilah admits she has gone up to a size 10-12 recently, but is still happy with the way she looks. Though to be told she won't get the work without losing weight 'obviously hurt'.

She joined a gym which is 'just at the top of the road, so no excuses not go'.

Lilah has committed further to her goals by signing up with a personal trainer who will help target the areas she wants to attack.

The Nosh juice diet starts on Monday 
and will last for five days in the run up to her presenting from 
Wireless next weekend. No solid foods are allowed.

Four delicious smoothies a day is all you need to have the perfect hour-glass figure, say the Nosh team...

Our clients have shown over years that the 6-day juice fast program is 'one of the healthiest and safest ways to achieve steady weight loss on the market today'.

The juice diet programme requires you to drink two litres of freshly-prepared juices every day for six days.

Each smoothie is rich in antioxidants and assists your body to detox naturally.

This, in turn, speeds up the process of regeneration and rejuvenation.

Benefits include:

• Helps maintain high energy levels since all the smoothies contain fruit pulp and fibre.• Assists the body in attaining its natural balance by detoxifying and cleansing thoroughly.• Increases the metabolic rate, thus helping in digesting food quickly and eliminating waste material regularly.• The extra weight can be kept at bay for a longer time period than is possible through traditional diet methods. The juice diet retrains your body and improves your overall dietary patterns.

Lilah admits she is 'worried' about 
five whole days on just juice, but 'apparently they are laden with calories to 
help you feel satisfied'.

‘I love food, especially pizza, but 
next week I am only allowed to have this yucky juice,’ she told a Daily 
Mail reporter at a Mayfair preview party Staying Alive for artists 
Christian Furr and 
Chris Bracey.

'Let's face it, I’m never going to be
one of those emaciated model girls, but my agency wants me to lose 
weight.

'Hopefully when I lose some more weight I will get more jobs, but in the meantime dieting is going to be hell.'

Speaking about money, Lilah added: 'Everyone thinks that if 
you're on the TV, you're loaded - but I'm not! I travel by tube and I'm 
often really sweaty when I arrive at glamorous parties. 

'I borrow cash from the bank of mum and dad, but then I have to give it back!'

She has started eating healthily this
week in preparation for the body-blitzing, and says she feels more energetic 
and her clothes feel a little bit looser. She said she would like to lose at
least half a stone.

'I am a size 10-12 and I want to be a size 8-10. In reality, as model, you should be a size 8,' she said.

Parsons 'loves' food and does not 
believe in 'irresponsible' dieting - but has put herself on a five-day 
juice regime, joined the gym and got a personal trainer because she 
wants to continue modelling.

Lilah, the daughter of the Queen's former Deputy Keeper of the Privy Purse 
said: 'I have been concentrating on my TV career recently and it's 
great, there is less pressure on a TV presenter to be a certain size, so I
probably haven't watched what I have eaten so much.

'And when you're on set you're grabbing something quick and easy to eat, which isn't always the healthy option.

'So
it's fair to say that I have gone up a size or two since I was 
modelling full time. And unfortunately size 12s don't fit in the 
designers' sample sizes.

'And because I want to carry on modelling, this 
is something I have been told to consider,' reported the Evening Standard.

Parsons
started modelling after she was spotted at a party in east London when 
she was 20. Six weeks later she was shooting for Chanel and doing 
catwalk shows for Westwood.

However,
after four years of modelling full-time, she decided to start going for
screen tests after she realised she preferred working with film crews 
over photographers.

Parsons,
who is presenting from the Wireless festival at the Olympic Park next 
week, said models should balance healthy eating and exercise rather than
dieting.

She said: 'I
think young aspiring models need to remember that there are ways of 
maintaining a good and healthy figure the right way. Exercise and 
healthy eating.'

Max 
Clifford Associates, who represent Parsons in her TV work, confirmed she had been asked to lose weight by her 
modelling agency.
