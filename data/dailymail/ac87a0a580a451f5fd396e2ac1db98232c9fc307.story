Deranged: In his latest command from a prison cell he will never leave, paedophile Warren Jeffs gave the names of 15 men chosen to father all children of the Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints Church

Polygamous leader Warren Jeffs has issued a new command to his sect from his jail cell - the names of 15 men he has chosen to father all future children of his church.

The Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints Church leader is serving a 130-year sentence at Powledge Unit near Palestine, Texas, for systematic child sex assault and marrying underage girls.

Jeffs, 56, still has around 10,000 believers in the towns of Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona. 

Former FLDS member Isaac Wyler told Deseret News that the rules were explained to the congregation at a Sunday service two weeks ago. 

He said: 'They said there had been 15 men delegated or designated by God to sire the new, special children.'

According to other reports, men who are not among the chosen few will have to remain under a 'no sex ban' that Jeffs demanded last year.

He declared that all marriages are void until he can return and 'seal' them.

The response from his congregation has been polarizing. For many, the ban on sex was the last straw. Families have begun fleeing the church - and after the latest command, it has been rumored that many more were planning to escape.

Husbands were said to be extremely unhappy that their wives will be made available to the 'chosen 15' with their roles essentially reduced to caretakers and financial providers, Deseret News reported.

Calls made to Rod Parker, a lawyer who has represented the FLDS Church in the past, were not returned to MailOnline.

The new directive seemed to counter another of Jeffs' revelations last month when the prison inmate said that abusing women was wrong.

some of whom were as young as 12, with Jeffs fathering a child by a wife
 who was only 15

He wrote: 'Let women be free, to be educated, to have full protection from abuse, ye nations.

'Let this truth awaken all to have life, yea, individual lives, in 
order, a holy Way of living my law of love for all, through pure way 
living on World.'

His sect practices polygamy in arranged marriages 
that have sometimes involved underage girls.

Jeffs was convicted last year of 
sexually assaulting two of his many underage brides when they were 12 
and 15 in the notorious case.

He was said to have at least 78 plural wives, according to court documents.

The further mandates by Jeffs came as voters in a tiny Utah town threw out a measure that would have dissolved their town government - amid fears that polygamists could seize an opportunity to widen their municipal borders and 'swallow us up'.

Apple Valley residents voting 167 to 115 against disbanding the town government. It had been suggested that neighboring Hildale - a town controlled by Jeffs - could stage a municipal takeover if the town were to
 abolish itself.
