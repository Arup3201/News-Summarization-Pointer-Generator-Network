An Arizona engineer has finally finished his four-year pet project to build a guesthouse in his backyard.

It's not just any guesthouse, and it's not just any backyard, either. Toshikazu Tsukii lives at La Cholla Airpark and his two bedroom guesthouse looks like it could take off along the private runway residents of the park enjoy.

The two-storey guesthouse is made almost entirely of aircraft parts.

Tsukii used three aircraft bodies to create the quirky dwelling: the nosecone of a 737, the fuselage of two 707s and the tail end of a 727, reports the Arizona Star.

The pool is covered with the fuselage of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet.

Tsukii, an engineer for Raytheon, accomplished several goals with the completion of his guesthouse.

The ambitious Japanese-born airplane enthusiast had always wanted to be an engineer, an aviator and an architect. With the completion of his guesthouse, he's crossed that last one off the list.

The 76-year-old designed and built the climate-controlled pad after seeing the nose cone of the 737 in a scrap metal yard which sparked his imagination.

At La Cholla Airpark, each of the 91 homes are arranged around a landing strip for the exclusive use of residents.

All the homes are on seven acre lots, leaving plenty of space for Tsukii to build his dream house.

He made the floor wider by cutting one 707 fuselage in half and spreading it apart. He also used first-class airline seats and improvised other furniture with parts, such as glass-topped tables from the engine cowling of a DC-9 and the wheel of a B-57.

Tsukii has always been inventive and a jack-of-all-trades.

The Arizona Star reports that a 1962 article from the Fort Scott (Kansas) Tribune described how Tsukii, then 24 and a Wichita State student, was putting himself through college working as a TV repairman, electronics technician, sign painter, judo instructor, photographer, folk singer, guitar player and Samurai swordsman.

He is still working full-time as Principal Engineering Fellow at Raytheon Missile Systems and flies his two Cessnas as one of only 3,000 monocular pilots in the U.S., having lost one eye to glaucoma.

Tsukii's wife of 50 years, Doris, says she's 'very proud' of her husband.
