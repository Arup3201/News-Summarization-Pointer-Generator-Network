Russell Brand has cancelled a sold-out live show after his mother Barbara was diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time.

The 38-year-old comedian had been due to perform at the Derby Assembly Rooms on Friday night, but made the decision to postpone the event in order to be with his family following the diagnosis.

A spokesperson for the venue said at the time: 'We are very sorry, but have just been informed by the promoter that due to a family illness, Russell is unable to perform this Friday. The date has been rescheduled for Monday, April 14, 2014.'

And explaining the reasons behind the cancellation of the Derby show, and one at the Warwick Arts Centre on Thursday night, Russell wrote on his Twitter page: 'Sorry to eff you around with gigs. My mum ain't well. Tix will be honoured or refunded.'

He later expanded on the illness during his YouTube show The Trews, saying: 'My mother has currently got breast cancer.'

Russell made the admission while talking about financial cuts to the NHS, adding that sensationalising cancer in the media isn't helpful for sufferers like his mother.

However, he did comment that she has been attending NHS support groups that she has found useful.

Barbara, who has a very close relationship with Russell, has previously beaten uterus cancer when the comedian was just eight, and breast cancer the first time a year later.

It remains to be seen whether or not Russell will continue with his scheduled Messiah Complex shows in Plymouth and London this weekend.

Apology: Russell tweeted his apologies to fans

MailOnline has contacted a spokesperson for Russell for comment.

Russell has long been a supporter of cancer awareness campaigns due to his family's history with the disease.

Promoting the CoppaFeel! campaign in 2010, Russell appeared in a video with his mother encouraging women to check their breasts regularly for lumps. 

With Barbara on camera with him, Russell is seen asking her, 'You had breast cancer, didn't you?' To which she replies: 'I did have breast cancer, yes.'

And when he asks her how she is now, Barbara replies: 'I'm very, very well.'
