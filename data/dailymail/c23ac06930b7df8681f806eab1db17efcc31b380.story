An investment firm billionaire claims his wife wanted a clause in their prenuptial agreement allowing her to move their three children to New York or San Francisco after a divorce because she found Chicago 'unsophisticated'.

During divorce proceedings in Cook County Court in Illinois, it was revealed that Anne Dias, 44, claims Ken Griffin, 45, was so upset by their pre-nup argument that he removed a post from their bed and threw it at her.

Yesterday Griffin, the founder and chief executive of $20billion Chicago hedge fund Citadel, denied throwing the bedpost during the 2003 argument after he 'inadvertently' removed it,

Griffin claims Dias wanted to be able to move their children to the coasts because Chicago is 'unsophisticated' 

Dias claims Griffin threw a bedpost at her after they argued about the Chicago (pictured) clause in their pre-nup

The argument about the Chicago clause happened days before the couple's lavish marriage ceremony in Versailles, France, the Chicago Tribune reported. 

Griffin said in his filing: 'Anne surfaced with a demand that the premarital agreement contain a provision permitting her, in the event of divorce, to take any children from Chicago and move them to either San Francisco or New York.

'She claimed she wanted this because she did not want to continue living in Chicago, which she considered to be unsophisticated.'

After Griffin balked at the demand, an argument ensued.

In an earlier filing, Dias said Griffin 'intimidated her by pulling one of the bed posts off its socket in their bedroom and throwing it violently towards her.'

She claims he screamed at her and she 'felt threatened and was fearful for her safety'.

Griffin refuted those claims in the filing yesterday.

He claims he 'inadvertently removed a bedpost from the bed, which resulted in a moment of levity ending the argument. 

'Anne did not leave the room during the argument, and the parties slept in the very same bed together that night and for years thereafter.

'All of these allegations are completely false and intended to tarnish Ken's reputation.'

 Griffin has been living in a $15 million penthouse condo at the Park Tower in Chicago during the proceedings 

A spokesperson for Dias criticized Griffin for his filing yesterday, the Chicago Sun Times reported. 

The spokesperson said: 'Ken Griffin, one of the wealthiest men in the world, continues to lie with impunity and to brutally and shamelessly attack the mother of his children in an effort to avoid his financial responsibilities to his family.

'Anne is saddened that he is using his enormous resources in an attempt to destroy her when it would be so easy for him to support his children as he always did during the marriage.'

Griffin filed for divorce from Dias last year. 

They had been married for 11 years and their children are aged two, four and six.

Griffin, who is estimated to be worth more than $5billion, is seeking joint custody. 

Dias, who has already secured more than $35million in the divorce, wants the children to herself. 

She is asking the court to throw out their prenuptial agreement and is demanding about $1million a month for 'child-related expenses'.

The couple separated in February 2012.
