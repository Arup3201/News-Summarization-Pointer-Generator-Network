Two brave police officers doubled snake catchers when they were called to a four-storey unit block in Sydney's south.

A terrified resident raised the alarm when they spotted a large Darwin carpet python slithering along their window on Chapel Street at Rockdale.

One of the officers was trained by Australian wildlife rescue organisation WIRES and luckily had his snake catching equipment with him.

But the policeman did not walk away unscathed after the snake bit him while he was trying to wrangle it.

Two constables captured a snake at a fourth-storey unit in Rockdale - in Sydney's south

When the police arrived about 10.30pm on Friday, the grey snake had wedged himself between the fly screen and the window of the unit.

As the WIRES-trained officer got his tools and started working on capturing the snake, his colleague held onto a net, ready to trap it.

At one point, the net-wielding policeman asked his partner - who was trying to pry the snake away from the window with a hook - what the snake felt like.

The snake-catching officer asked his colleague if he wanted to touch it. This was met with an emphatic 'No'.

But it proved to be a trickier task than initially thought as the creature was 'very strong' and refused to let go of the window's edge.

Eventually, the snake lets go but not before it was able to sink its teeth into the constable.

But a NSW Police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia no one was seriously injured during the process.
