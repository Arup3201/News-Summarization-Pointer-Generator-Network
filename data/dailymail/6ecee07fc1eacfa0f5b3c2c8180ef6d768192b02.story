A philandering music teacher sobbed as he told police how he killed his fiancée after she ‘lashed out’ at him in an argument over the care of their daughter, a jury heard yesterday.

Andrew Lindo, 29, described graphically how he first tried to strangle Marie Stewart at their home before battering her with a Winnie the Pooh chair and eventually stabbing her.

Lindo claimed Miss Stewart, 30, the mother of his two children, had generally become ‘abusive, insulting, rude and demeaning’ towards him.

Killed: The body of Marie Stewart was found after seven weeks; Andrew Lindo told police how he had killed her after they had an argument

He told police he had been driven to infidelity by his partner’s jealousy and concern about who he was texting.

Describing the row in the bedroom that led up to the alleged murder, Lindo said Miss Stewart got ‘really angry and lashed out at me, hitting me. I was getting more and more upset. She just kept hitting me and I grabbed her arm.’

Lindo said he then grabbed his fiancée around the throat. ‘I just kept squeezing and squeezing and squeezing,’ he told police.

‘When I let go I was thinking “this is just a nightmare, this is just horrible’’.’Lindo dragged Miss Stewart downstairs but she started making ‘gurgling’ noises and he tied a belt around her neck to try to make it stop.

Grief: Katie Stewart and Robert Stewart, the father and sister of murder victim Marie heard all the sordid details

In the dark: Marie Stewart's mother Helen at Bradford Crown Court, and right, Angela Rylance, the woman whom Andrew Lindo was having an affair with

But the noises continued and he thought ‘I’m obviously s*** at strangling you, I’m going to hit you’ and he picked up his daughter’s wooden Winnie the Pooh chair and struck Miss Stewart about the head, Bradford Crown Court heard.

He said: ‘I just wanted her to shut up, just wanted her to be quiet, I just wanted the nightmare over.’

Lindo told police he dragged her into the garage and decided to cut her throat.

‘I put some bubble wrap round her face because I didn’t want her to look at me,’ he said. He grabbed a knife and ‘jabbed it in’. Then he put her body in a Virgin Atlantic flight bag and hid it at the back of the garage.

‘I wanted to lock the door and pretend it never happened.’

Scene of the crime: The house at Holmfirth, Huddersfield, where the body of Marie Stewart was found in a suitcase in the garage

He said he’d hoped to convince people she had run away with another man so that he could get on with his life with the children and he tried to ‘ignore’ the fact he had a dead body in the garage.

But Miss Stewart’s family became increasing suspicious of her disappearance and seven weeks later police found the body.

Lindo was having an affair with cashier Angela Rylance – who believed he was a single parent – at the time and had previously cheated on his fiancée with other unsuspecting women, the court has heard.

Lindo told police he and Miss Stewart were sleeping apart after the birth of their second child. ‘We were in the house but we weren’t together,’ he said.

‘She went insular and very demonstrative towards me and insulting me – generally abusive,’ he said. ‘Her behaviour was so rude and so demeaning towards me.’ Lindo told police Miss Stewart was not maternal towards their children and he suspected she had mistreated their three-year-old daughter.

He appeared to blame his fiancée for the affair with Miss Rylance  as well.‘I just felt dogged,’ he said. ‘Marie was obsessed about my phone and about who I was texting when I was texting.’  He added: ‘It was almost as if I thought, well you know, b******* to it if you think I’m having an affair then.’

Lindo, of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, denies murdering Miss Stewart last December but has admitted unlawful killing.

The case continues.
