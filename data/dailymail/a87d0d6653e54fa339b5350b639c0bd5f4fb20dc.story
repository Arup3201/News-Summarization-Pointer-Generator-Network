Britain’s Got Talent presenter Dec Donnelly celebrates after backing a winner at Ascot races yesterday.

He was watching the action from a box with a group of chums including his television co-star Ant McPartlin and a glamorous blonde friend.

Dec, 38, who is currently dating his long-time manager Ali Astall, could hardly contain his excitement as the horse came home.

He grinned alongside Gemma Waterhouse, 
finance director of the British Racing School based in Newmarket, who 
wrapped an arm around his neck in excitement.

The duo look ecstatic as their bet, a 16-to-one outsider, comes home at Ascot on Saturday

The duo backed a 16-to-1 outsider that romped home in first place so had plenty to celebrate at the prestigious racecourse, which was staging the annual British Champions Day.

Fellow racegoers included the Queen and Princess Beatrice.

Insiders at the racecourse box say married racing expert Gemma had been helping her celebrity fellow guests pick out horses and the pair leapt for joy as their winner crossed the finish line.

But there was less luck for Her Majesty, 
whose own horse Estimate – previously unbeaten in three starts and a 
winner at the Royal Ascot meeting in June – failed to maintain its 
winning ways.

Geordie duo Ant and Dec are huge racing fans and co-own a racehorse with pal Simon Cowell.

News of Dec’s romance with Ali emerged in August.

The pair have grown close despite being friends for years, and had quietly been dating for several months before deciding to make their relationship public.
