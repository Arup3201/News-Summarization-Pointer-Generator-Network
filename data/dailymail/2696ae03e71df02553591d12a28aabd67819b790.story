With Andy Murray KO'd from Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage, Roy Hodgson's sorry Three Lions sent home from the World Cup after just two games, and England's rugby team whitewashed in New Zealand, there hasn't been much for British sporting fans to get excited about this summer.

So, it's hardly surprising to see the bookies already backing Formula One star Lewis Hamilton to claim his first Sports Personality of the Year award later this year.

A runner-up to boxer Joe Calzaghe in 2007 and then Olympic hero Sir Chris Hoy in 2008, Hamilton is now the 15/8 favourite to claim the coveted gong.

And the 29-year-old will be given centre stage to stake his claim for votes when over 120,000 fans descend on Northamptonshire, and many more tune in on TV for this weekend's British Grand Prix; the 50th to be held at Silverstone.

Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg are expected to pick up their season-long battle with the home crowd largely rooting for the Stevenage-born racer, who last won in front of his home crowd six years ago.

Hamilton was victorious in torrid conditions - a masterful drive, where he finished an epic 67 seconds ahead of his nearest challenger.

In contrast, Hamilton's former team-mate Jenson Button, reckons he needs somewhat of a 'miracle' to stand on the top step of the rostrum on Sunday.

Button, who is in the midst of another disappointing campaign with McLaren, is a whopping 122 points behind Rosberg in the drivers' championship.Â 

'Lewis has got a good chance of 
winning,' he told Sportsmail. 'Being British I really hope he does. It 
will be amazing for the British public and the British fans, and the 
atmosphere at Silverstone, so it would be very special. I will give him 
that one.'

Button will be taking part in his first race at Silverstone since the passing of his father, John, who died earlier this year.

The
 McLaren driver has called on fans to wear pink to this weekend's race -
 the colour John sported in the paddock throughout Button's career. 
Button will also sport a one-off pink helmet.

'I
 have made sure I have not pushed it too much, but it is amazing how 
many people have got in touch saying they would love to wear pink,' he 
said.

'It
 started when I won my first grand prix - he was wearing pink - and he 
just continued it with every race he came to after that. It is going to 
be very emotional for me to see a lot of pink shirts out there.'
