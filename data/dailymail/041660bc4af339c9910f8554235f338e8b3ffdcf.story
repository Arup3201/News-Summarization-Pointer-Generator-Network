NHS Health Trusts have spent more than £6million in taxpayers' money on equipment for obese patients since 2012, it has been claimed.

The money spent by NHS Trusts went on items such as reinforced operation tables, super-sized beds and extra-large bedpans for patients weighing up to 70 stone.

The £6million figure does not include any money spent on medication or care, and the total figure could be much higher as not all 245 NHS Trusts in Britain revealed their figures.

Sherwood Forest Hospital Trust in Nottinghamshire spent a total of £728,000 in 2012-13, according to the Sun.

Breaking that figure down, the Trust spent a reported £52,000 on two operating tables for patients weighing up to 70 stone - making it the biggest spender on specialist equipment for obese patients.

Last year the the people of the East Midlands were revealed to be the fattest in Britain with more hospital admissions for obesity-related illnesses than anywhere else in the country.

The Nottinghamshire district of Bassetlaw had the most obesity-linked hospital admissions - an incredible 2,878 per 100,000 people, which works out at almost six times the national average.

The purchase of two reinforced tables suggests the number of obese patients in the area is so large that there is a risk of two extremely overweight patients coming in for an operation at the same time.

The Trust also spent £76,000 on 29 extra large trolleys to transport obese patients.

Other big spenders were Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospital Trust, who reportedly paid £1,000 for a fat suit so that members of staff could experience obesity, and Salisbury Trust who are said to have spent £5,000 on extra large gowns to cover overweight patients.

Meanwhile East Midlands Ambulance Service are believed to have spent nearly £200,000 for three vehicles with specialist lifiting equipment and ramps, and Tameside Trust who paid £2,000 to widen the doors in their mortuary so obese patients could be accommodated.
