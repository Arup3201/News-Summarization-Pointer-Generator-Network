A bride has been arrested for allegedly charging her $50,000 luxury wedding to her employers' credit cards.

La'Reese Michelle Darville, 31, was jailed on fraud and grand theft charges on Monday, five months after she married husband Darell at the Seminole Hard Rock Casino in Hollywood, Florida.

She has been accused of charging bills from the wedding to credit cards in the names of her bosses at a pawn shop - including her father. She only allegedly had permission to charge $10,000.

Police began an investigation after one of the owners of Partners III Pawn Shop in Port St. Lucie received late payment notices for a credit card the company had not used for two years.

At the store, police spoke with two other owners who said that Darville, their operations manager, takes care of their finances.

One company credit card was $10,000 over its limit and another had been charged $28,000, according to a Port St. Lucie police report, the Palm Beach Post reported.

The charges included payments to wedding photographers and planners and for renting the casino. Darville's father, Leroy Felix, said he knew nothing of the charges.

Arrest: She insisted it was a 'huge misunderstanding' and that she intended to pay it back

When quizzed over the payments, Darville 
acknowledged using the cards for her wedding but blamed it on her 
father, who she claimed had told her to use the credit cards.

Police say the $10,000 charged on her father's
credit card occurred after he gave his permission, but Darville did not have 
permission to charge $39,286.24 to other accounts.

Speaking to police, she allegedly admitted to using the account 14 times for her wedding but that she intended on repaying the business in full. She said she had already paid back more than $17,000 - although she had no record of it.

Photographs taken of the big day reveal lavish touches, from rose petals lining the aisle and an arch of white flowers showcasing their wedding cake. Guests watched the ceremony in the casino's grand ballroom before partying at a reception and dinner that ended at midnight.

La'Reese was joined by nine bridesmaids wearing pink satin dresses and matching silver shoes, while her husband and his groomsmen wore matching white suits.

Darville told the Palm Beach Post that the situation had been a huge misunderstanding.

She said her father, Leroy Felix, a part owner of the business, gave her permission for the charges. She said her father had given her with a credit card number linked to the business.

'Caught': Police went to the business after one owner received late payment notices for a credit card the company had not used for two years. It emerged she had charged them nearly $50,000

Wedding: Darville, left with two of her nine bridesmaids and right with her then-fiance, allegedly admitted to using the company's credit cards 14 times to make purchases for the wedding

'It's been said, or worded, that the card was stolen,' Darville said. 'I called. He gave me the number and (said) use it. I used it and it was being paid back, so I have no idea what the whole big deal is about, but (certainly) it was a huge mix-up.'

But local businesses employed for the wedding were less forgiving.

'I just canâ€™t imagine what was going through her brain that day,' said their photographer Sara Kauss. 'She should have worked hard and saved up and then planned this wedding.'

Darville said she recently left the company and is now a stay at-home mother. She has now been released from the St. Lucie County Jail on $,7,500 bail.

Business: She worked at this St Lucie, Florida pawn shop, where her father also works. She blamed the expenses on her father, telling police that he had given his permission for her to use the cards
