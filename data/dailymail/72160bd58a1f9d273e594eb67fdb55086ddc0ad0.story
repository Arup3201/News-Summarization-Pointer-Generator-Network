Private eyes: Simon Cowell is on the list drawn up by Soca

Simon Cowell is on an explosive list of blue-chip firms and individuals who used rogue private detectives, it emerged last night.

The music mogul is among the 102 names on the list drawn up by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) that the Commons Home Affairs Committee is threatening to publish on Monday.

The list is dominated by big law and finance firms and high street solicitors, but also contains two individuals – one of whom is multi-millionaire Cowell.

Soca has stressed that the presence of a name on the list does not amount to evidence of wrongdoing.

Officials say many clients of rogue investigators did not commission information-gathering activities or will not have been aware that the private eyes broke the law to obtain information.

Following a threat last week by Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, to publish the list, senior MPs lined up with Establishment figures yesterday to demand that it remain secret.

In what appeared to be a co-ordinated campaign, other Commons committee chairmen backed Britain’s most senior anti-terror officer, the Information Commissioner and Cabinet Minister Andrew Lansley to insist the plan to publish the list be shelved.

It has raised the stakes even higher in a long-running row over whether the list drawn up by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) should be made public. Mr Vaz has given Soca an ultimatum to publish the dossier by Monday – or see MPs do it themselves.

He said it gave an appearance of ‘injustice’ for law firms, insurers and other big businesses on the list to remain secret while journalists have been relentlessly pursued for links to phone hacking and other illegal practices.

But yesterday, Soca director general Trevor Pearce rejected this request and, in a strongly worded letter, called on Mr Vaz to think again.

The committee was bombarded with letters from senior figures saying it would do great harm to publish the list of 102 law firms, insurers, financial companies, banks and individuals who were clients of corrupt investigators.

They included warnings from Mr Lansley, who is Leader of the Commons, the Information Commissioner Sir Christopher Graham, and Sir Alan Beith and James Arbuthnot, the chairmen of Westminster’s Justice and Defence Select Committees, respectively.

Mr Pearce also said that he had the support of Met Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, who is in charge of terrorism.

The onslaught alarmed MPs, with one senior committee source commenting: ‘This is very suspicious. It seems there is some sort of co-ordinated operation going on to prevent us from publishing what could be very embarrassing information.’

MPs were given two reasons for secrecy. Mr Pearce and the Information Commissioner claimed publication might compromise inquiries into whether those on the list could be prosecuted. Sir Christopher said: ‘It’s not clever to start a criminal investigation by publishing the names of everyone and everything you’re investigating.

Mr Lansley and the two committee chairmen took a different line, pointing out that when Mr Vaz received the list from Soca in July he gave an undertaking it would be kept confidential.

Mr Lansley said that, if Mr Vaz broke his word, future inquiries by MPs could be refused access to confidential documents.

Mr Vaz now faces tense talks with fellow committee members. They have so far insisted it is vital the public know the truth about relations between big firms and corrupt detectives.

Mr Vaz told Mr Pearce last week: ‘We’ve taken legal advice and we believe it’s important that this should be done.’

Tory member Michael Ellis said: ‘There don’t seem to me to be any issues of national security or other issues pertaining to the wider national interest.’
