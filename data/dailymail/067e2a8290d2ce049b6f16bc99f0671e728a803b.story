An elderly woman was killed when she was run over by a bin lorry. 

The pensioner was crossing the road outside the shop in The Shambles in Worcester when the vehicle pulled away without seeing her, trapping her beneath its wheels. 

Emergency services arrived at the scene but were unable to save the woman who has not yet been named. 

An elderly woman died after being hit by a bin lorry as it collected rubbish from an Argos in Worcester

A local shop-owner who witnessed the tragedy said: 'They had both been collecting rubbish from Argos and were parked up behind each other.

'But one pulled away as the old lady was walking between the two of them, and its gone into her pretty hard. She’s then gone under the wheels.

'She didn’t stand a chance but it looked like a complete accident. The driver couldn’t see her but he looked really shaken. It’s an absolute tragedy.

'The road is only pedestrianised after 10am, which seems wrong really as its gets busy with people way before then.

'It’s only a narrow street and we’ve said its only a matter of time before somebody gets hurt or killed with lorries going along it at that time of the morning.

Passers-by watched on in horror as the elderly woman, who has not been named, became trapped under the lorry's wheels

The shop in Worcester remained closed for the rest of the day as staff were left shocked by the tragedy

'Maybe the council will think twice about changing that now a poor old lady has lost her life in this way.'

A spokesman for West Mercia Police said: 'The Shambles remained closed to traffic while the crash investigation team carried out its work examining the evidence.

'We are now working to identify the victim and inform the next of kin, after which we will be able to release details about her identity.'

The street was cordoned off between as crash investigation officers conducted inquiries.

An ambulance, a responder paramedic and a paramedic area support officer also attended the scene.

The waste management company, which is not run by the council, was collecting rubbish from Argos

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman added: 'Upon arrival crews found a pedestrian, a woman, who had been in collision with a lorry..

'Sadly, it quickly became apparent to ambulance staff that nothing could be done to save the woman and she was confirmed dead at the scene.

'Ambulance staff assessed several bystanders who were suffering from the effects of shock after witnessing the incident but no one required hospital treatment.

'The road remains closed by the police.' 

Worcester City Council confirmed the vehicle was not one of their fleet and said it was a commercial waste collection lorry.

Argos remained closed for the rest of the day, with a spokesman saying: 'We offer our deepest sympathies to her family and are providing help and support to our colleagues affected by this tragic event.' 

Smith Waste Management, the company which the lorry belongs to, has been contacted by MailOnline.
