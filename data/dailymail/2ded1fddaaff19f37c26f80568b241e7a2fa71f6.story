'It's not going to be as easy as it should be, because everyone has different ideas as to exactly how our country should be constituted.'

'But if we talk about it in the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood and sisterhood, I am sure that we can finish this great journey together and then we can march on, on the great journey of our nation together.'

Mr Abbott attended the award ceremony, a joint venture between Reconciliation Australia and BHP Billiton to 'identify, celebrate and promote effective Indigenous governance'.

This year, eight of Australia's most outstanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations were selected from 113 nominations from a diverse range of sectors and industries. 

The Prime Minister gave out awards to several winners, including a Central Australian women's group and a theatre troupe from Victoria.  

Waltja Tjutangku Palyapayi Aboriginal Corporation from Alice Springs and Swan Hill's The Marruk Project were awarded the best run Aboriginal organisation and project in the country by a judging panel which included the heads of the Business Council and Productivity Commission.

Awards chair, Professor Mick Dodson, said when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were empowered to take decisions about their lives, and draw on culture as a strength and resilience, anything was possible.
