Behind bars: Jason Harewood was jailed for robbing a man at knifepoint

A teenage robber who robbed a man at knife-point has been jailed after being caught by an iPhone tracking app.

Jason Harewood, 19, had only just been released from prison for a previous knife-point robbery when, covering his face, he pulled a knife on a 42-year-old man in Fortis Green, North London on March 15 this year.

Harwood, of Islington, London demanded the victim’s phone, cash card and pin number before warning him not to call police and running off.

But the victim quickly rang 999 and, 
while being driven around by plain-clothes officers, used a police iPad 
and the 'Find my iPhone' app to track his phone to Islington, where he 
pointed out Harwood.

Self-employed
Harewood tried to run from police and ditched the stolen phone in some 
bushes but was arrested shortly after trying to hide on top of garages.

Harewood pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years at Wood Freen Crown Court.

Investigating
officer, DC John Martin of Haringey CID thanked the victim for phoning 
the police quickly and praised the tracker technology for its usefulness
in bringing criminals to justice.

I’d like to thank the victim of this robbery for his diligence in phoning police on 999 at the earliest opportunity and having already installed and enabled the tracker app on his phone prior to the theft.

'His actions enabled police to do what we like to do best, to obtain best evidence and to arrest the offender at the earliest opportunity,” DC Martin said.

'Faced with the overwhelming evidence Harewood realised he had no option but to enter a guilty plea.'

DC Martin said he was happy with the lengthy sentence dished out to Harewood.

He said: 'Harewood had only been released from prison on licence a couple of weeks before carrying out this robbery, having served one year of a two year sentence for a knife point robbery just streets away the previous year.

'By carrying out a similar offence, he has shown a complete disregard for the criminal justice system and for the right of law abiding members of the public to go about their business without fear. I am pleased that he will not be walking the streets for a significant period of time.'

Borough Commander Sandra Looby urged people to download tracker apps for their phones and electronic devices.

She said: 'This case exemplifies the professionalism and dedication of my officers when it comes to tackling violent offenders and dealing with incidents of robbery and knife crime.

'We’ve had some real successes using tracker technology to trace stolen phones and computers resulting in police returning stolen property to victims of crime, obtaining convictions and also putting those handling stolen goods out of pocket.

'Help us to help you. Search the internet for theft recovery apps or software and see which ones people recommend. While most of the basic tracker Apps are free, the more advanced ones - that take photo’s of the person using the device - do tend to have a cost.

'Only last week my officers arrested someone on suspicion of handling stolen goods after the victim of a theft presented police with photos of someone using their stolen macbook and location information.'

'I urge people to install and activate an appropriate tracker service on their device. Importantly, also set a lock code so that a thief can’t de-activate the tracker while they try to make their escape.'

'Register any serial numbers of valuable electrical items onto the immobilise.com database free of charge, as this also helps us to return stolen property to its rightful owner and to catch the people that help drive theft by their involvement in handling stolen goods.

'Remember, if you’re set to get a new phone, tablet or computer in the coming months, make sure you re-install any tracker or anti-theft software onto it.'
