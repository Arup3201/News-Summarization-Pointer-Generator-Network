Colleagues of a respected judge who drowned in floodwater while trying to cross a ford in his car said today they were 'shocked and saddened' by his death.

Jonathan Gammon, 52, was swept 200 yards downstream by fast flowing water with his wife and dog in their silver Toyota Yaris yesterday.

The Mental Health Tribunal judge's 55-year-old wife, who was driving, managed to swim to safety following the incident at about 9.10am.

Deadly: The ford at Headley, North Hampshire. The depth marker at the ford showed the water was six feet deep.

Today Judge Phillip Sycamore, President of the First Tier Tribunal, Health, Education, Education and Social Care Chamber, paid tribute to his colleague.

Judge Sycamore said: 'I'm greatly saddened and shocked by the tragic death of my colleague Jonathan Gammon.

'Jonathan, who had tremendous talent,
became a full time judge in 2009 having previously had a distinguished 
career as both a barrister and a solicitor.

'He served as a legal advisor in the magistrates' courts and prior to becoming a full time judge, was Head of Performance and Analysis for Her Majesty's Court Service.

'He was a very well respected and popular colleague. Our thoughts are with his wife and family. Jonathan will be much missed.'

Locals said they feared Judge Gammon, 
from Teddington, west London, may have been directed to cross the 'notorious' 
waterway in Headley, Hampshire, by a sat-nav system.

The incident happened following torrential rain on Sunday, with localised flooding prompting the Met Office to issue a severe weather warning in the region.

Firefighters were called at 9.07am yesterday after reports that a couple and a dog were stuck in a car 5ft underwater.

When they arrived at the ford, Judge Gammon's wife had managed to swim free but her husband and dog were still inside.

Hampshire Fire and Rescue officers broke the car's window and pulled Judge Gammon free, but he was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

His wife was taken to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital where she was treated for shock. The dog also died.

Locals have labelled the ford 'one of the most notorious in the south of England'.

Plumber Simon Hiscock, who was working near to the ford, rushed to the scene after seeing around a dozen emergency vehicles.

The 48-year-old said the ford was well known and should be shut for winter.

He said: 'Unfortunately, a lot of satellite navigation systems direct people along the road as a shortcut between Basingstoke and Thatcham.

'It may save people a couple of minutes but in this instance their choice of route has had tragic consequences.'

Sergeant Paul Plews, of Hampshire police, said: 'Our thoughts are with his wife and family who are understandably very distressed by what has happened.

'Our investigation is focused on establishing the events leading up to Mr Gammon's death and we will be preparing a file for the coroner.'

The man's death came on the day the 
Met Office announced this April has been the wettest on record.

The historic Gloucestershire town of Tewkesbury - devastated by flooding
in July 2007 - was again under water as rivers burst their banks.
