He did it in March 2010... and now he's done it again.

David Cameron, clearly a fan of Harry Potter, has once more referred to Liam Byrne as 'Baldemort'.

The Prime Minister first used the term during his budget response two years ago - and today, the Labour shadow Work and Pensions Secretary was reminded of the abrasive moniker.

As Tory MPs focused on the subject of the benefit cap, Mr Cameron mocked the Labour front bench for not stating its position on the issue.

The PM said: 'Just nod - are you with us or against us?'

As the camera panned across the faces of the Opposition, Mr Cameron added: 'A great big vacuum.'

And although Mr Bryne was present at the House of Commons, the Tory leader didn't seem to notice him, saying: 'Where is Baldemort? He's not at home today.'

When Mr Byrne vacated his position as Chief Secretary to the Treasury in May 2010, he famously left a note for new incumbent, David Laws, which read: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid to tell you there is no money. Kind regards and good luck!'

And although Mr Cameron managed to get away with his latest swipe at Mr Byrne without any chastisement, he did get a ticking off for calling Labour leader Ed Miliband a hypocrite

Mr
Miliband said legislation requiring banks to disclose how many employees were
paid more than £1million was already on the statute book and could be
implemented by ministers.

But Mr
Cameron told him: 'We now have the toughest and most transparent regime of
any major financial centre in the world.

'For
the first time ever, banks are going to publish the pay of the top eight
executives. That never happened in 13 years of a Labour government.'

But he
said Sir David Walker, who had proposed the reforms on publishing the number of
£1million salaries, had recommended it should be done across the European
Union.

Mr
Miliband said the Prime Minister was giving 'no leadership on top
pay' and added that 'there are more than eight people earning over £1million at our banks'.

He said
Chancellor George Osborne had backed the reforms before he took office and it
was 'another broken promise'.

Mr Cameron
shot back: 'It was the last Labour government, when you were in the
Cabinet, that agreed an RBS bonus pool of £1.3billion, literally hundreds of
people were getting million-pound bonuses and you signed it off.

'The
issue for you is why are you in favour now in Opposition of things you never
did in Government?

'Some
might call it Opposition, some people might call it hypocrisy.'

Mr Cameron
was forced to withdraw the comment after Commons Speaker John Bercow ruled: 'The use of the word hypocrisy in relation to an individual Member is not
parliamentary.'

The Prime
Minister said he was 'very happy' to withdraw the comment, adding: 'I think it's just because we are expected to listen to the people who
presided over the biggest banking and financial disaster in our history.'

Mr
Miliband told Mr Cameron that hypocrisy was 'saying you are going to stop
a £1million bonus to Stephen Hester and then nodding it through'.

Mr Hester
bowed to mounting public pressure and waived his near-£1million share bonus
after a public row over the payment.

The Labour
leader told Mr Cameron: 'I think we have now heard it all, because you
said that the class war is going to be led by you and your Cabinet of
millionaires.

'I
don't think it's going to wash, frankly.'

Turning to
the issue of putting workers on pay committees, Mr Miliband said it would 'bring a does of realism' to salary awards.

It would
mean 'people on a huge salary at least have to look one of their employees
in the eye and justify it'.

Mr Cameron
said: 'I don't think it is practical to do what is suggested. It breaks an
important principle of not having people on a remuneration committee who have
their own pay determined.

'So I
don't think it's the right way forward.'

The Prime
Minister claimed that Mr Miliband wanted to ban performance-related pay in all
but exceptional circumstances, which would be 'completely wrong' and 'shows he hasn't got a clue how to run an economy'.

Mr
Miliband said: 'Now we know where the Prime Minister stands: no to
transparency, no to an employee on the remuneration committee.

'What
was the Chancellor doing last week when they were supposed to be cracking down
on top pay? He was going to Davos to tell the business community to lobby for a
reduction in the top rate of income tax.

'We
know the truth: when it comes to top pay, this Government and this Prime
Minister are part of the problem, not part of the solution.'

Mr
Cameron, after the rebuke by the Speaker over the use of the word 'hypocrisy', said: 'I don't know what the word is for
criticising someone who went to Davos, when you went to Davos yourself...'

He added: 'I think the word Peter Mandelson used (about Mr Miliband) when he was in
Davos was "struggling".'

Mr Bercow
quipped: 'The Prime Minister is exceptionally well-educated and I'm sure
he has got a very full vocabulary and can make proper use of it.'
