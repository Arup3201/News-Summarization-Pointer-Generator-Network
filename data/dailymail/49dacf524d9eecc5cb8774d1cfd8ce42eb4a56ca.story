Aid workers are fighting an outbreak of cholera in South Sudan which has killed 23 people and infected at least 670 and is now threatening to spread rapidly across the war-torn country.

So far all the confirmed cases are confined to the capital Juba where tens of thousands of people have sought refuge at UN refugee camps following five-and-a half months of ethnic violence and civil war.

But the U.N. believes the disease is spreading with unconfirmed cases reported in other parts of the impoverished country including in Jonglei, Lakes and Upper Nile states.

The often fatal disease is spread though contaminated water and food. Two to five days after infection it causes severe diarrhea as the body is drained of water. 

To make matters worse the region is currently experiencing unusually heavy rainfall, which has the potential to exacerbate the spread of the disease and is hampering aid efforts.

In total some 1.3 million people are believed to have been displaced by the civil war with an estimated 4.9 million in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, according to figures from the Christian Aid Charity.

Cholera is an acute intestinal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae.

It has a short incubation period, from less than one day to five days, and produces an enterotoxin.

That causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given.

Vomiting also occurs in most patients.

Speaking on Wednesday World Health 
Organisation spokesman Abdinasir Abubakar said: 'So far as of yesterday,
 we have over 670 cases that have received treatment. Out of that, 23 
people have died from cholera.

'We are still at the early stage of the outbreak'.

The UN is working to move displaced people from the cramped conditions of camps in Juba to other sites around the country in a bid to to reduce the risk of an outbreak.

Most patients being treated for the disease at the Juba Teaching Hospital were found to have been drinking untreated water from the River Nile supplied by water tankers.

Efforts are now underway to chlorinate the water shipment in order to kill off the Cholera bacteria.

Among the confirmed infections are 100 children. 

South Sudan saw massive violence sweep the country in December, when fighting in the world's newest nation broke out between troops loyal to President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and those loyal to his former vice-president Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer.

Kiir fired Machar last July and accused him of trying to oust him in a coup in December, which sparked months of ethnic attacks.

An initial cease-fire in January failed. A second cease-fire on May 9 has led to a tense standoff in the country.

The toll has been huge: thousands killed, more than 1.3 million people forced to flee their homes, including between 75,000 and 85,000 who sought refuge in U.N. peacekeeping camps, and the threat of famine because farmers couldn't plant crops.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power urged Kiir and Machar to implement the cease-fire agreements without further delay and resolve their dispute.

Power said the ethnic violence and absence of 'a credible peace agreement' required the council to 'prioritize the safety and well-being of the South Sudanese people first and foremost' and end the U.N. mission's 'direct support to the government.'
