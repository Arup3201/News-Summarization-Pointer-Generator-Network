The skeleton of an elephant that belonged to Louis XIV has been attacked by a man with a chainsaw who hacked off its left tusk.

A 20-year-old man was caught carrying the tusk over his shoulder after escaping over a wall from the Museum of Natural History in Paris on Friday night.

He was taken to hospital with a fractured ankle and was being questioned by investigators.

Police found the chainsaw still whirring
inside the museum, left behind by the thief. It is not known if he 
planned to sell the 6.5lb tusk, but he told detectives he was interested in its valuable ivory and did not attack because he wanted to vandalise the museum.

A neighbour of the museum on Paris's Left Bank alerted police after hearing a whirring sound at 3am.

The target of the attack, an African elephant skeleton, was given to the Sun King by Portugal's king in 1668.

It lived in the zoo at the Palace of Versailles for 13 years until its death, when its skeleton became part of the natural history collection.

The tusks of the skeleton were added in the 19th century but are still historically and scientifically valuable.

The museum opened as usual on Saturday but the damaged skeleton was covered in plastic wrapping while repair work began.

Museum restorer Jacques Cuisin told the Daily Telegraph: 'The skull is in excellent condition, which means repairing it will be quite easy.'
