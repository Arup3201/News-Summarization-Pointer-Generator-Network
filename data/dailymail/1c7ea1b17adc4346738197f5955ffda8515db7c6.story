Three alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel are in jail after allegedly bringing their brutal tactics north of the border and using them on a South Carolina man who owed them a $200,000 drug debt.

The FBI says the men kidnapped a 23-year-old from his hometown in St. Matthews, South Carolina, on July 9 and held him for nearly a week while they tried to extort up to $400,000 from his family.

He was rescued mostly unharmed early Tuesday from a home in rural Roseboro, North Carolina, where he was found chained to the floor and blindfolded.

Authorities say the man was a drug runner, responsible for distributing marijuana and cocaine across North and South Carolina for a Mexican drug cartel.

The cartel members got angry a 200lb shipment of marijuana that he was supposed to deliver to a drug dealer went missing. Authorities are not sure whether he stole the marijuana or was ripped off by the dealer.

The FBI operation to free the hostage was a massive undertaking, that spanned North and South Carolina, Texas, Mexico and several other states.

Authorities estimate that up to 500 federal agents and police officers were involved in the effort.

The man is currently not in custody and does not face any charges.

'Right now he's a victim, and we will 
have to look at that very carefully,' said FBI agent David Thomas, who 
is in charge of the Columbia office.

Juan Manuel Fuentes-Morales was arrested at a different house and found with one of the phones used to negotiate the extortion, the FBI says

The kidnapping began early July 9 when the three men, posing as police officers, pulled the man over as he was going to work in his hometown of St. Matthews, about 30 miles southeast of Columbia.

His truck, still running, was left on the side of the road with its door open.

Ransom demands were sent to the man's family within hours of his disappearance and continued for several days.

The night he went missing, the man's fiancee began receiving calls demanding up to $400,000 for his return. Agents traced the calls to Mexico and then to North Carolina.

Early Tuesday morning, agents raided a home in Roseboro, about 160 miles northeast of the man's hometown, and found him bound and in chains, being guarded by two men.

According to court documents unsealed Wednesday, the man later told agents he tried to cut off his restraints with a knife, but a kidnapper discovered his attempt and hit him in the jaw and pointed a gun at him.

Authorities said Juan Manuel Fuentes-Morales, Ruben Ceja-Rangel, Luis Castro Villeda appeared in federal court in Raleigh on Wednesday on charges of conspiracy to kidnap. Court documents did not say what cartel with which they are associated or indicate their nationality. Their ages and home addresses were also withheld.

The three men were held without bond pending a detention hearing before a federal magistrate judge scheduled for next week. The Federal Public Defender's Office in Raleigh has been assigned to represent them. A message seeking comment was not immediately returned.

Officials said the U.S. attorney's office in Columbia will be handling the prosecution and that the three defendants will likely face extradition to South Carolina.
