When wildlife photographer Kathleen Reeder visited a lion sanctuary in South Africa, she promised herself she wouldn't leave without getting some terrific snaps.

And as these dramatic pictures show, she got exactly what she came for.

As she watched a pride of lion cubs drink from a watering hole, a crocodile lunged out of the water and snapped its jaws.

Kathleen, 56, was amazed as the juvenile lions first growled, but then quickly backed away from the pond in shock.

And before the surprised photographer or the lions could catch their breath, the hungry reptile had disappeared back under the water.

Thirsty: The cubs stopped at the watering hole for a drink under the hot sun in Ukutula Lion Centre, in South Africa

What's that? But when one noticed ripples appearing in the water, the lions grew wary

Snap: Suddenly, a crocodile sprang out of the water with a snap

Kathleen said the experience at Ukutula Lion Centre, in South Africa, was 'thrilling'.

Kathleen, from Phoenix, Arizona, said: 'The lions were quenching their thirst with a drink of water from the pond's edge.

'When the crocodile suddenly appeared they started growling at the water.

'The moment the crocodile lunged out of the water, the lions were seriously startled and jumped back as fast as they could.

'No lions were hurt but there's no way they were going back to the water line on that day.

Happy snap: Kathleen was leading a photo safari in South Africa and was on a 'lion walk' with staff and the one to two-year-old lions at the park, an hour from Pretoria

'Sometimes even when you expect something to jump out and scare you, when it happens, it stills scares you, every time.

'And it certainly scared me! I felt the same as the lions when the crocodile came out.

'By the time I took a second breath, the crocodile had descended back into the pond waiting for another day to make an appearance.

'It was thrilling to have experienced this moment.'

She added: 'Ukutula offers a lion walk to their guests, where one can walk with juvenile lions and staff on trails.

'It's a wonderful experience to be up close with these beautiful animals.'

Staff at the park have named the crocodile Sparkly after one of the guides.
