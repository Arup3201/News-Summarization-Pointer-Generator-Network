It's not just Barbora Zahlavova-Strycova’s name that’s long. In the mind of Caroline Wozniacki, who exited these Championships on Monday, the speed of her play is on the lengthy side as well.

Indeed, so agitated was the Dane that she supported calls for a shot clock as a means of tackling slow play between points — a suggestion that came after something of a tantrum on the subject during her fourth-round defeat.

The flashpoint came when Wozniacki, a set and a break of serve down, took exception to the time it was taking Zahlavova-Strycova to tie her shoelaces.

Unexpected: Caroline Wozniacki was a shock loss on Monday at Wimbledon

‘She’s taking a minute between points,’ the 16th seed said to the umpire, who replied: ‘She was tying her shoes.’ But Wozniacki was unimpressed, saying: ‘There’s always something.’

She had calmed down by the time she addressed the press but still called for a measure to address what has become a serious problem in the game. 

Players in a Grand Slam are given 20  seconds between points, though umpires rarely enforce the rule, and Wozniacki said: ‘I thought she was very slow. But I guess the referee has the time on it. It’s up to the referee or up to the umpire to say if she is or not.’

When asked about a shot clock, she added: ‘I wouldn’t mind. I think that’s fine. You have a clock and it shows exactly how much time you take in between points.

‘If it’s there, it’s great. If it’s not, it’s up to the referee to say if it’s slow or not.’

Of course, gripes over the time between points should not disguise the fact that Wozniacki, formerly the world No 1, was comprehensively outplayed by her unseeded Czech opponent. Or that she failed, once again, to raise her game in the later rounds of a Grand Slam.

Surprise package: Barbora Zahlavova Strycova pulled off a stunning victory to beat Caroline Wozniacki

For Zahlavova-Strycova, the world No 43 who was suspended for six months last year after testing positive for a banned stimulant, this run to the quarter-finals marks her best performance at a Slam and a vindication of sorts for not quitting the sport during her ban.

She claimed at the time she had not intended to enhance her performance by ingesting the stimulant via a supplement, and the game’s authorities accepted her explanation. But it has, nonetheless, been a difficult journey for the 5ft 4in Czech with the big groundstrokes.

‘I didn’t want to play again because I felt like it was a little bit unfair,’ she said. ‘I was feeling that for about a month (during her ban). I was like, “I don’t want to be here and see the same people every week”. I was empty. I took off and I didn’t focus on  tennis at all. I didn’t follow any results.

‘But then I thought, “Yeah, what am I going to do? I love the sport.” And then I didn’t ask myself any more.’

Meanwhile, Sabine Lisicki’s mission to exorcise the memories of her collapse in last year’s final continued with a three-set win over Ana Ivanovic in the third round.

Ivanovic was booed off on Saturday evening when she refused to play on because of the darkness, with Lisicki 6-4, 1-1 ahead.

The Serb returned to take the second set  6-3, but she fell apart in the third, losing 6-1.  Petra Kvitova, the sixth seed and 2011 champion, needed only an hour and one minute to beat Shuai Peng 6-3, 6-2 and reach the quarter-finals for a fifth straight year.

She faces fellow Czech Zahlavova-Strycova in the last eight, while Lucie Safarova, a third Czech, is also through after crushing Tereza Smitkova 6-0, 6-2 in 48 minutes. The 23rd seed has not yet dropped a set in the tournament.
