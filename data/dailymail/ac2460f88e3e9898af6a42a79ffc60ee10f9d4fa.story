Tough: Ethan Kosak-Hine, 12, escaped with a broken foot after a half-ton gate fell on to him outside his parents' home in Ickenham, London

A brave schoolboy told yesterday how he survived being crushed by a half-ton metal gate at his parents' home.

Martial arts fan Ethan Kosak-Hine was closing the electronic gate at the property in Ikenham, north west London, when it came loose and toppled onto him.

The 5ft tall by 12ft wide barrier - which weighs the same as a small car - crushed his entire body before being dragged off him by his family.

His mother Maria, 40, her mother 
Sharon Kosak, 63, and partner, Paul, 41, a decorator, managed to lift 
the gate off and they pulled Ethan to safety.

The 12-year-old’s left foot was very badly broken and was left hanging off of his leg.

Incredibly,
cool-headed former healthcare assistant Sharon managed to stem the 
blood flow and keep her grandson alive until air ambulance medics 
arrived.

They rushed him to the Royal London Hospital where surgeons managed to reattach his foot and save his life.

Yesterday Ethan - a member of the Great Britain Taekwondo squad - vowed it was only a matter of time before he is able to resume his martial arts training.

He
said: 'I do not remember much of the accident - I think I passed out 
with the pain. I can’t explain why, but I just love Taekwondo. It made 
me feel really confident and strong in myself.

'I will never give up and hope to be back in the ring again as soon as possible.'

Ethan credited his grandmother for helping to save his life.

'I
am really grateful to her and I am so glad she was there,' he said. 
'She used to work in accident and emergency so she knew what she was 
doing.'

Weight: The gate - which weighs as much as a small car - crushed Ethan's entire body when it fell off its hinges

Heavy: Ethan's family managed to pull the huge gate off of him before phoning for an ambulance

Injury: Ethan's foot was left hanging from his body following the accident. He spent ten days recovering in hospital

Mother-of-four Maria yesterday it was 'every mother’s worst nightmare to see your son in so much pain and have no idea how to save him.'

'The gate is so big and heavy I never thought we would get him free,' she said. 'It was horrific. His foot was dangling from his leg.'

She said that since the accident five 
men and the landlord have tried to put the gate back into place, but 
that it has been too heavy to lift.

'It must have been sheer adrenaline that made the three of us lift it that day,' she said.

Ethan, from Ickenham, north west London, has been learning Taekwondo for two years.

He has a red belt with black tag and was in training for his full black belt when the incident happened on September 8.

Ethan had been called up to join the GB team training squad just a month earlier.

The pain was so severe while the youngster was waiting for the emergency services to arrive that he started to hallucinate.

Bizarrely, at one point he even told his mother he was chasing after butterflies and could see himself being born.

Surgeons spent four hours operating on him and fitted him with pins and screws to help reattach his foot. Brave Ethan spent ten days in hospital and still has to have fortnightly check-ups to monitor the healing of his wound.

Medics believe his foot will recover enough for him to walk, however, it will not be strong enough for him to fight for at least two years.
