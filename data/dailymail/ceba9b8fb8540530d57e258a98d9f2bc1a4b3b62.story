A learner driver left his friend dying at the scene of an accident he caused before fleeing the scene and callously telling the teenager’s parents that their son was safe.

Uninsured Jay Gilbert, who was 17 at the time, fled after ploughing his Suzuki Swift into a van as he pulled out of a junction, leaving witnesses to call an ambulance for his seriously injured friend.

Joshua Reed, 18, was pronounced dead at the scene minutes later, but his family didn’t find out for two hours because of Gilbert’s lies.

Jay Gilbert, now 18, left, admitted killing his friend Joshua Reed, right, 18, in the crash last October. The pair had been friends for around a year but Gilbert left Mr Reed in the passenger seat to die at the scene

As Mr Reed lay dying, Gilbert had taken a lift to his friend’s home where he tried to cover up what he had done by telling Joshua's worried parents their son was alive and talking to firefighters.

His relieved dad Michael Reed rushed to the scene of the crash with Gilbert, who told him he believed Joshua's teenage girlfriend had died.

Mr Reed learned the truth from a police officer two hours later as he waited behind cordon near the Tally Ho pub, on the A15 near Sleaford, Lincolnshire, on October 6 last year.

Gilbert admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to 27 months in a young offenders institute and banned from driving for three months at Lincoln Crown Court last Friday.

The court heard how Gilbert had bragged to friends that he had passed his test – but in fact was still a learner who was only allowed to drive with adult supervision at the time of the crash in October last year.

Mr Reed, from Spalding, Lincolnshire, yesterday recalled the moment Gilbert tried to cover up the truth about Joshua's death by saying it was his girlfriend who had been the victim.

The 38-year-old said: ‘(Gilbert and his friend) told me they felt sorry for her family, so I assumed she was dead and I was standing there thinking how I was going to console Josh.

The family of Joshua Reed, pictured, only found out the devastating news of his death two hours after the crash

'They said Josh was fine, was walking around and talking to the firemen.

'When we arrived at the crash scene 
they said they thought Josh's girlfriend was lying in the middle of the 
road and we shouldn't hold out too much hope.

'Everything fell into place when a police officer told me Josh was dead and Jay had been arrested nearby.

Michael Reed, 38, Joshua's father, said he was heartbroken to find out his son died with a stranger

'I'm glad Jay admitted what he had done and that he's got sentenced.'

He
said Gilbert, who had known his son for around a year, announced in the
pub around six weeks prior to the accident that he had passed his test -
and he had no idea it was a lie.

Mr Reed, who has seven children, added: ‘It is hard enough to deal with the fact your son has been killed in an accident, but I think you could come to terms with that, but not this.

‘This accident should never have happened.

‘But putting all that aside, when they crashed he should have stayed there and held Josh's hand until he died.’

Mr Reed later found out it had been left to witnesses to call 999 after the crash because Jay Gilbert ‘did a runner’.

Mr Reed added: 'What hurts the most is the fact that Jay left my son to die on his own in that car.

'A chef from the pub called the ambulance and held his hand telling him he was going to be OK.

'Joshua was on his own and probably knew he was dying. It's heartbreaking.'

Recorder Gareth Evans QC told him: ‘It has to be immediate custody.

‘You pulled out in front of a van coming towards you. An experienced driver would not have done what you did.

‘A collision was inevitable and as a result of that you killed someone.'

The court heard Gilbert, from Boston, Lincolnshire, lied to his friends six weeks before the fatal crash when he told them he had passed his driving test.

Stuart Lody, prosecuting, said: ‘He was the holder of a provisional driving licence.

‘Astonishingly he said he did not know about the requirement to have L plates fitted on a car he was driving.

The accident happened close to the Tally Ho pub on the A15, near Sleaford in Lincolnshire in October last year

‘He also said he did not realise he had to have a qualified driver sitting with him.

‘It is accepted he must have looked, possibly to the right first and then left and then looked right again and pulled out into the path of the van, the driver of which had no time whatsoever to react and a collision occurred.'

Michael Cranmer-Brown, defending, said: ‘It was a momentary lack of attention through his inexperience that caused the collision.

‘He was reasonably badly injured himself. He had a severe break to his arm and that had to be operated on.’

Another friend also suffered serious injuries after he was thrown from the car in the crash.

Mr Cranmer-Brown said that Gilbert had also suffered retribution within the community having his injured arm broken again when he was attacked. 

Joshua, an apprentice carpenter, was just three days off his 19th birthday when he was killed in the crash.
