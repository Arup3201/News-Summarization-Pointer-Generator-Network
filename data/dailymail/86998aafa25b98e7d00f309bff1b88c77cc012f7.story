French football clubs are threatening to cancel games over the government's plan to impose a 75 per cent super-tax on the country's richest clubs.

President Francois Hollande has pledged to push through the levy which will see giant of the country's game like Paris St Germain have to pay out on wages over €1m per year.

He told reporters at the European Union summit that 'the law must be the same for all' suggesting stand by the controversial policy, despite the threat of abandoned matches.

Big earner: The tax will effect clubs like Paris St Germain who are reported to be paying Zlatan Ibrahimovic, above, 14m euros per year

The law would affect clubs rather than the players as it is geared toward making employers bear the tax burden.

It means, for example, that PSG would have to pay a 75 per cent tax on any wages over €1m that they pay to their superstars.

Their highest paid player is Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who ears a reported €14m per year.

Jean-Pierre Louvel, president of the Union of Professional Football Clubs, says the law would be 'the death of French football' if it is pushed through.

His union has threatened to boycott the round of league games scheduled for November 29 through to December 2.

Mr Hollande said he was willing to meet the clubs next week to address their difficulties but said he would not budge on their main complaint.

Once the plan is voted into law, Mr Hollande said, 'it will be the same for all companies, whatever they may be'.

The last time games were boycotted in the French league was in 1972, but that was at the initiative of the players.

The tax was a campaign promise from Mr Hollande, who pledged to rein in what he said was excessive executive pay out of line with the struggling economy.

The tax designed to be in place for two years, starting retroactively this year, and the government expects it to net 420 million euros, around £360 million.

It would cost clubs 44 million euros, or £37 million, over that period.

Pledge: Hollande sailed to victory in the 2012 general election on the promise of a super tax, which was hugely popular with voter. He has insisted he will see the promise through, saying the law 'must be the same for all'

The proposal for such a tax hike was the most memorable promise of his campaign, and polls have shown it was widely popular, even if it generated heavy criticism from business leaders and sports organisations.

Mr Hollande's initial proposal called for individuals,in the case of football, the players to pay a 75 per cent tax on all income over a million euros.

That tax was rejected by a court this year and the budget before parliament would instead put in place a fifty per cent tax, paid by the employer.
