A boy bullied for having Asperger’s has been told he will never walk again after falling 50ft from a bridge while trying to escape his tormentors.

Joshua Davies, 18, was running away from a gang of boys across a river when he plummeted on to rocks below, breaking his spine in four places and leaving him paralysed from the waist down.

His family claim he has been picked on relentlessly over the past five years by a group of younger teenagers, who saw him as an ‘easy target’.

Joshua’s stepfather Michael Morgan, 
35, last night accused police of repeatedly failing to act, after his 
family pleaded for help on more than 15 occasions.

On
 the afternoon of August 17, the teenager and his friend were walking by
 the river when they realised the bullies were following them.

‘They heard them shout, “There they are – let’s get them,”’ said Mr Morgan.

‘Joshua
 and his pal climbed on to the steel supports of the bridge to get away 
but the boys started throwing stones at them. One of the stones hit 
Joshua on the shoulder and another hit him on his foot. He lost his grip
 and fell.’

Joshua, who also broke both arms and legs in the accident, was still in hospital yesterday.

He was attacked by members of the same gang earlier this summer when he refused to buy them alcohol, his family claim.

‘He
 came out of the local corner shop and one of the boys jumped on his 
back and started hitting him on the back of his head,’ said Mr Morgan, 
an electrical engineer.

‘That was the only time he defended himself and he was arrested and charged, which made him scared to defend himself again.’

Mr Morgan said his stepson, who was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome at 14, is ‘trusting and can be easily manipulated’.

‘He
 does not always have a sense of danger. We have tried to instil it into
 him, but you can’t wrap him up in cotton wool, although now I wish we 
had done.’

The bullying 
became so bad that Joshua was increasingly anxious whenever he left his 
home in Pontypridd, South Wales. ‘He has been forced to avoid certain 
areas, which has made him a prisoner in his own community,’ said Mr 
Morgan.

Asperger's syndrome is a form of 
autism, which affects people's social skills, ability to communicate and
 how they relate to the world around them.

As autism is measured on a 'spectrum', there are wide variations in how it affects those who suffer from it.

Often
 those with Asperger's syndrome have difficulty maintaining eye contact 
when speaking to others and are awkward when interacting with people.

They can develop unusual preoccupations, or rituals, and show repetitive behaviour.

The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, although it is thought it could be genetic given it tends to run in families.

It is four times more likely to occur in males than in females.

There
 is no single cure, although a range of treatments, including special 
education, speech, physical or occupational therapy and medication can 
be used to help treat it.

‘He has felt 
threatened and been constantly on edge ...  even if he saw a group of 
innocent boys approaching he would start to worry.’ Mr Morgan claimed 
that Joshua went to the police more than 15 times about the bullies’ 
attacks, but that they ‘didn’t take him seriously’.

‘His problems were brushed under the carpet because they thought he was messing around,’ he said.

Joshua had recently left school and was due to start a course in electrical engineering and construction this week.

However, he has been told he can no longer attend as it is not suitable for wheelchair users.

He has undergone three operations and will not be able to sit up for six weeks, but his family say he remains upbeat.

Joshua's parents said he was recently chased into a local supermarket by a group of bullies and a security officer had to help him to escape through the back door while the manager called the police

Joshua’s
 mother Cheryl, 44, a full-time carer for her other son Michael who also
 has autism, said last night: ‘Joshua is not  a fighter – he’s a very 
gentle young man who now faces life in a wheelchair.

‘I think this could have been prevented if the police had listened to him.’

Detective
 Inspector David Peart said: ‘I can confirm that South Wales Police 
responded to allegations of assault on three separate occasions between 
April 2011 and June 2014.

‘On
 each occasion, a thorough investigation took place and appropriate 
action was taken. There is no evidence to suggest that the incident 
which took place on August 17 is connected.’

Three teenagers – two aged 15 and one aged 16 – were arrested and remain on police bail.
