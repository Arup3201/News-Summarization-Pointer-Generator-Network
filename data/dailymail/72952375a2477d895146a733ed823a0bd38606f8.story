Barcelona manager Luis Enrique has said he takes 'full responsibility' for the defeat to Real Madrid, and has also defended Thomas Vermaelen's ongoing injury situation.

Enrique's side lost 3-1 at the Bernabeu, and the Catalan side faced are thorough dissection in the Spanish press. Despite several players coming in for criticism, the 44-year-old said he should shoulder the blame.

'I take full responsibility for the defeat at the Bernabeu,' Enrique told Marca. 'But we're still joint-top of the table with Sevilla after nine matches. I'd be worried if there were an attitude problem, but that's by no means the case. We lost for footballing reasons and I hold my hands up, it was my responsibility.

'Real Madrid made us play on their terms and imposed their game on us. We were a shadow of ourselves, but still we were brave in our approach.'

Belgian defender Vermaelen joined Barcelona in the summer but is yet to play for them due to a thigh injury, leading some to question both the situation and the player.

Enrique was quick to defend the former Arsenal man when quizzed about his slow progress, but did admit the recovery was not going to plan.

He said: 'I don't know what you're trying to dig up. He's been out for a whole year and is still recovering. He's doing individual exercises, so obviously his recovery isn't going as we'd hoped.'
