Reform plans: Binyamin Netanyahu's new coalition government is likely to attempt to change conscription laws for ultra-Orthodox Jews

Ultra-Orthodox Jews could be drafted into the Israeli military under plans by Binyamin Netanyahu's new government to cut the country's benefits bill.

Mr Netanyahu's coalition government, which is expected to be announced later this week, wants to introduce new legislation that will see communities currently exempt from service conscripted.

Former military chief Moshe 'Bogie' Ya'alon, the man expected to become Israel's next defence minister, is the driving force behind the controversial move which has already sparked protest among the ultra-Orthodox community.

The move will take the community off the country's benefits bill.

Netanyahu's government wouldn't be the first to attempt to alter the law, with succesive administrations seeking to reform the tax allowance and benefits system for ultra-Orthodox Jews.

But the next government is said to stand a better chance than its predecessors as Mr Netanyahu is to exclude the ultra-Orthodox Shas party from his coalition, instead including the centrist Yesh Atid party, the Jewish Home party and the Hatnua pary.

Mr Ya'alon's emergence in Mr Netanyahu's government represents a change in political direction with his appointment likely to herald a tougher policy towards Iran.

Amir Buhbot, military analyst for the Walla news site, told The Times: 'When it comes to Iran they (Mr Netanyahu and Mr Ya’alon) have mirror opinions.

'They both believe that sanctions are important, but will not hesitate if Israel needs to carry out a strike on Iran. 'Ya’alon is the one that helped draft up the plans on Iran, he knows the capabilities of the army and would be the most trusted to lead them in that scenario.'

The right wing former intelligence chief has been critical of Europe and the US for dragging their feet and sending out 'mixed messages' to Iran and has called for an international coalition to confront the country because of the danger it poses.

Mr Netanyahu, who will control 70 seats of the 120 seat parliament in Israel, could be set to formally come to an agreement with coalition partners as early as tomorrow, according to The Times.

Mr Netanyahu, chairman of the Likud party, first served as Israeli Prime Minister between 1996 and 1999.

He was defeated in the 1999 election and temporarily retired from politics.

But he later returned to politics after the fall of his successor Ehud Barak's government and went on to serve a second term between 2009 and 2013.

He was the first Israeli-born Prime Minister after the formation of the state.
