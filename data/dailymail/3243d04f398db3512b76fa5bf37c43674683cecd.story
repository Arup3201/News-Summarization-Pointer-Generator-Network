Caution: Socially mobile Pippa Middleton at Queen's Club watching the tennis

As the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister, she is guaranteed a place on every guest list in town.

But Pippa Middleton has been quietly asked by Kate and Prince William to scale back her public appearances, The Mail on Sunday has learned.

The 29-year-old is being encouraged to lower her profile amid concerns that she is leaving herself open to criticism.

Last week, she was seen in Wimbledon’s Royal Box and at Sir David Frost’s annual summer party, where she mingled with guests including Stephen Fry, Sir Elton John and Sir Bruce Forsyth.

She has also written for this week’s edition of The Spectator, is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and has a monthly column in Waitrose Food Illustrated.

But friends of Prince Harry have now revealed that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are advising caution.

The friend said: ‘Pippa has been asked to tone it down.

'Kate and William didn’t want her to write her party planning book Celebrate, let alone a regular column in various magazines.

‘They have spoken to her about this.’

Pippa has since tried to cut back on the number of public events she attends.

A friend said: ‘She’s been strategically scaling down the amount of times she is pictured at launches, especially clothing launches.

'She is trying her best to avoid the cameras where she can.’

Two weeks ago, Pippa also reportedly 
pulled out of playing a charity tennis game at The Queen’s Club after 
being put under pressure by the Palace.

In some matters, however, Pippa is determined to remain independent.

It is understood she has left the Richard Ward Salon used by her sister and mother Carole.

She is instead having her hair cut at Rossano Ferretti, which has an upstairs VIP lounge in Mayfair.

Her Italian stylist, Pol Garcia, charges around £260 for a cut and blow dry.

The salon’s other clients include the model Poppy Delevingne and Amanda Ferry, wife of rock star Bryan.

Earlier this month Pippa landed a new job as Vanity Fair contributing editor.

In her first editorial for the glossy title, the 29-year-old sister of the Duchess of Cambridge writes about her most memorable experiences at Wimbledon.

It is a second regular magazine job for the aspiring lifestyle guru, which she will write in addition to her monthly Friday Night Feasts column in Waitrose Magazine.  It follows the publication of her first book, Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities for Family and Friends, last year.

Published ahead of Wimbledon this year, the article sees Pippa describe the tournament as 'the highlight of my summer', and recalls her first visit to the All England Club at the age of eight.

She says that she was an aspiring professional tennis player at the time, and remembers purchasing a postcard of the women's championship trophy and writing on it: 'I will win this one day.'

She admits that as a child, she imagined she would get married in tennis whites, 'shorts with no pleats or frills.'

Pippa, who is dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, 35, tells readers that she has now grown out of her tomboy phase, but that said, there will still be 'no white dresses this summer, apart from at my local tennis club.'

She says a favourite Wimbledon memory was queuing with her sister on People's Sunday in 2004 to get £35 tickets for Centre Court - something that would be highly unlikely - and indeed unnecessary for them today.
