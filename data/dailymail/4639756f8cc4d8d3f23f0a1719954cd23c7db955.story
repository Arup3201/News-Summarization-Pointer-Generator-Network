A rare transcript of the conversation between NASA's mission control and the ill-fated crew of the Apollo 13, including the famous line 'Houston, we've had a problem', has been put up for sale.

Every last word transmitted between the moon landing mission and ground control in the U.S. was recorded for use by journalists covering the six-day mission, which had to be aborted after a dangerous explosion on the rocket.

Much of the conversation was of little interest until two days into the mission, the third Moon landing attempt, when commander Jim Lovell reported an explosion on-board.

Famous words: The transcript, featuring an Apollo 13 astronaut informing ground control of the famous 'problem', is expected to fetch £5,000 at auction

Ill-fated: Apollo 13, pictured taking off from Cape Canaveral on April 11, 1970, never landed on the moon

Lovell contacted mission control in Houston, Texas, at 9pm on April 13, 1970 saying: 'Okay Houston. Hey, we've got a problem here.'

Asked to repeat the message, Lovell replied with the famous line: 'Houston, we've had a problem.'

An oxygen tank in the service module had exploded while en route to the Moon around 200,000 miles from Earth, sparking a fire which ripped through the spacecraft.

Lovell and his crew Jack Swiggert and Fred Haise had no choice but to abort the mission.

With the service module so badly damaged their chances of making it back to Earth safely had also suffered a huge blow.

They risked everything by shutting down the service module, on which the command module relied, and moving to the lunar module for the majority of the return journey.

The risk paid off and the crew successfully landed safely in the South Pacific Ocean where they were picked up by a US Navy ship.

The real-life drama was immortalised in the 1995 movie Apollo 13 starring Tom Hanks.

The 1,000-page transcript covers every moment from lift off to re-entry and belonged to British journalist John B. Phillips, who worked for the European Broadcasting Corporation.

It is tipped to fetch £5,000 when it goes under the hammer at London auction house Christie's.

James Hyslop, an expert at Christie's, said: 'This document is incredibly important because of the human story behind it.

'The Apollo 13 mission is one of the most famous of all time because of its edge-of-the-seat drama.

'NASA had invited about 40 journalists to their headquarters to report on the mission and provided each one with the transcript of the conversations between the astronauts and mission control.

'There are thousands of pages of fairly mundane transcript but just one that jumps off the page.

'Aside from Neil Armstrong's moon landings, those fateful words 'Houston, we've had a problem' are the best known from any space mission and here they are in paper.

'The incredible thing that comes across is the calmness of the astronauts on board. There are no raised voices, no signs of panic, just sheer professionalism.

'This copy of the transcript, which is kept in two ring binders, belonged to a British journalist from the European Broadcasting Corporation.

'It is a hugely historic document and an amazing one to read.'

Also included in the sale, which will take place on September 6, are press packs from the Apollo 14 and 15 missions which also belonged to John B. Phillips.
