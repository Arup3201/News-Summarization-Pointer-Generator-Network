Acne sufferer Cassandra Bankson used to be so ashamed of her looks that she refused to leave the house without wearing make-up.

But today the 19-year-old, from Danville, California, revealed that with the help of a dermatologist she has conquered her skin condition and now has the confidence to go fresh-faced.

The size 4 brunette, who shot to fame last year after releasing a series of YouTube make-up tutorials on how she hid the spots covering her body, is now finding success as a model and last week she made her first catwalk appearance at New York Fashion Week.

Fresh faced: Cassandra Banks, who used to have acne covering her face, neck and back, says that she has now conquered her skin condition and doesn't feel the need to wear makeup

Talking about overcoming her fears and anxiety, 5ft 11in Ms Bankson who has also fronted campiagns for brands such as Bebe and Range Rover, told the Today show on Monday: 'Beauty is confidence. You can’t have outer beauty without having that inner beauty.

'I go out without makeup all the time and I feel just as free and liberated as if I was wearing a full coverage foundation.'

Fashion designer Stacey Igel, of the Boy Meets
Girl label, said she was immediately struck by Ms Bankson's looks and decided she would be the perfect fit for her runway show  in Chelsea, 
Manhattan.

'Cassandra's long hair fit the style of what we’re doing. Natural, carefree, she definitely had the vibe of what I was casting for the show,' she told the Today show.

Commenting on her first runway assignment, Ms Bankson told the New York Post at the time: 'It feels like a dream to be here during Fashion Week... I am a different person from who I used to be because I’ve got so much more confidence now,'

Model looks: Cassandra Bankson, who endured 
years of bullying over the acne which covered her complexion,  is set to
star at New York Fashion Week, walking for U.S. label Boy Meets Girl.

Here to help: The teen wanted to show others that there is hope if you have bad skin...

Ms Bankson, who was diagnosed with 
cystic acne at 14. says her skin condition is about 70 per cent improved
since she first hit the web.

Since posting her YouTube video she has shared more of her tips on her You Tube channel 
'diamondsandheels14' and via a blog. Her dream is to create her 
own skin care range.

Ms Bankson
said the response to her first video was overwhelming. 'It was a real 
eye opener,' she told Good Morning America. 'It (acne) is such epidemic 
for adults as well as teens.'

At
the start of her video, which was shot in her parent's lounge,she is seen wearing full make-up and looking picture-perfect. It's
only as she starts stripping back the expert layers of primers, 
foundation, powders and setting sprays, that the true extent of her 
pimpled and blemished skin is revealed.

The
teen, a horse-back riding and hiking fan, returns to the camera in a 
bathrobe at her 'most insecure,' with bare skin and looking a very 
different person.

'I feel 
really disgusting,' she admits, adding  'this is probably the most 
nerve-wracking thing I could possibly do because it is my biggest 
insecurity... But this is my face.'

She goes to show the extent of the problem as the acne has spread to her neck, shoulders and back.

It is a far cry from the modelling 
portfolio shots that can be seen on her YouTube channel, where the 
striking brunette lounges on car bonnets, takes to the catwalk and poses
in cut-out swimsuits with flawless skin.

The teen, then takes viewers on a step-by-step lesson on how to achieve her look by applying foundation.

Lotions and potions: Applying a mutitude of different cosmetics, the teen carefully covers her scars and spots

'I have extremely oily skin,' she says, giving tips about the primers and oil-reducing tricks.

Applying liberal amounts of 
cosmetics, Ms Bankson seems well ahead of her years, confident and 
knowledgeable about the complex potions upon which she relies.

She is frank, even wry, about her spots: 'I always carry everything down my neck because, well, I have acne there.'

She
has become something of a skin expert, with other videos explaining the
physiology of skin and acne and the treatments that best target the 
skin condition.

By the end of the video, Ms Bankson is transformed - her flawless complexion giving no hint of the severe breakouts

'Voila!
I have somewhat clear looking skin,' she tells the camera. 'I hope that
you guys enjoy this. I hope you can have flawless skin too.'

Fresh-faced: The lesson almost complete, Cassandra demonstrates the art of clever make-up use

Beauty guru: In other films, Cassandra addresses 'contouring and shading' and teaches about acne formation. She shows her modelling portfolio in another, and would like to become a dermatologist
