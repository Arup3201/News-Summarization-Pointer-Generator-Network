President Obama lashed out Tuesday at Republican lawmakers during a Hollywood speech seemingly designed to shift public debate away from his Obamacare- and Iran-related political train wrecks and toward safer territory: jobs and the economy.

Speaking to a crowd estimated at between 1,800 to 2,000 people – primarily staff of the DreamWorks Animation film studio, according to a White House pool reporter – the president slammed GOP partisans while claiming economic moral high ground that poll numbers suggest he's incapable of holding.

'Instead of rooting for failure or re-fighting old battles, Republicans in Congress need to work with us,' he declared, complaining about his opponents' fixation on the Affordable Care Act.

'We would be a lot further along without some of this dysfunction and obstruction we've seen in Washington,' he insisted,.'if we didn't [sic] have one wing of one party that was a little less obsessed with repealing health care for 40 million people.'

Obama's speech at DreamWorks Animation may be a payback for CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg's massive fundraising haul on the president's behalf

He claimed that the nation would have created more jobs through infrastructure projects and other initiatives if Republicans 'hadn't spent more than 40 votes trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.'

More than 6 in 10 American workers told pollsters in a recent Washington Post survey, co-led by a University of Virginia agency, that they fear they will lose their jobs, the highest such number measured since the 1970s. And 32 per cent said they worry 'a lot' about becoming suddenly unemployed.

The DreamWorks crowd was safe political territory, a company led by major Democratic donors and situated in Hollywood's liberal enclave.

Obama played to the crowd, saying as he departed that 'I can't wait to see your next movie!' and praising the U.S. entertainment industry for providing the world's best 'place to make movies and television and music.'

Nationally, though, he's having trouble re-establishing his credibility after the disastrous launch of his signature health insurance overhaul, and persuading Americans that he's up to the job of rescuing the country's faltering economy.

A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday showed that 53 per cent of Americans believe the president is not honest and trustworthy. And only 40 percent say he can manage the government effectively.

Six months ago, Obama maintained his high voter ratings on such personal attributes even as his job-performance began to tank. But no more.

Teleprompters are commonplace in Hollywood, and put Obama in his element as he soaked in the sun and delivered his outdoor speech on Tuesday

So instead of touting his own bona fides, he took a page from his campaign playbook and attacked his opposition.

Republicans, he said, had done 'nothing to create jobs, or grow the economy, or strengthen the middle class.'

Obama blamed Republicans for stonewalling his policies, and took credit for economic developments, like rising domestic oil production, that have come about despite his policies

Casting himself as the nation's public-opinion barometer, he declared that 'the American people agree with us' – meaning Democrats – 'that jobs and growing the economy should be our top priority.'

'For instance, he claimed that 'for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more of our own oil than we buy from other countries.'

But the Energy Information Administration says America's boom in domestic oil output is due mostly to hydraulic fracturing – fracking – a controversial technique used to get oil from shale deposits. That method has drawn ire from Democrats in Congress and among the president's nonprofit environmental cheerleaders.

It's Republicans, especially those from states like Texas and North Dakota, who have pushed the fracking revolution forward.

And Obama claimed that 'thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act, health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in 50 years.'

That finding came from a report prepared by the president's own Council of Economic Advisers, an office within the White House. The group said last week that health care spending grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent rate per capita since 2010, the lowest rate on record for any three-year period.

But overall, health care expenses in the U.S. amount to 17.7 per cent of GDP, by far the highest such measure in the developed world.

And by every measure, consumers are on average facing higher insurance costs as the Affordable Care Act reaches full implementation.

Obama has failed to endorse or embrace fracking, as a hat-tip to green campaigners. But the technology is responsible for the U.S. oil boom he touted on Tuesdady

Jonathan Gruber, an economist at MIT who helped craft the Obamacare law, warned USA Today that 'I think the health economists are still saying, "Wait and see" ... what will happen in the long term.'

Obama insisted Tuesday in Hollywood that he's not letting up as his health insurance plan approaches a series of key deadlines.

'Yes, we are going to continue to implement the health care law. The product is good. People want it,' he claimed.

'Thousands of Californians are signing up,' Obama added.

And in a wry acknowledgment of the technical glitches that have made Obamacare a laughingstock, the president insisted, 'By the way, the website is continually working better. So check it out.'

Presiding over the Hollywood Affair was DreamWorks Animation studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of Obama's most stalwart and consistent fundraisers. He raised $15 million for the president's 2012 re-election campaign during just one expensive, star-studded dinner last year.'

White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest, however, downplayed the coincidence.

'Mr. Katzenberg's support for the president's policies has no bearing on our decision to visit there,' he told reporters Tuesday on Air Force One.
