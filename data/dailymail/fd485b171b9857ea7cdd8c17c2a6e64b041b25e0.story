Surgeon: Dr Philippe Leynaud, 62, has been struck off - six years after his first misconduct hearing

A bungling French eye surgeon who blinded three of his patients has finally been struck off - six years after his first misconduct hearing.

Dr Philippe Leynaud, 62, was employed to cut waiting lists at Yeovil District Hospital in Somerset by carrying out cataract operations at weekends.

His employers compensated four of his patients after botched operations prompted legal claims. Three lost their remaining sight in the eye while the fourth was ‘severely visually impaired’.

But the consultant ophthalmic surgeon was allowed to continue working in Britain after a General Medical Council panel stopped short of imposing a ban in 2007 and said that conditions were enough to protect the public.

Three years later a review panel extended the conditions, which were due to expire next month, but the doctor has been struck off at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester.

The panel decided the doctor, who has not worked in the UK since 2003, had not shown enough insight into his actions or any evidence that his skills had improved.

Chair Gill Mullen said: ‘The panel considers Dr Leynaud to have demonstrated a persistent lack of insight into the seriousness of the consequences of both his deficient performance and lack of commitment to remediation.

‘The panel has concluded that these departures from good medical practice pose a serious risk to patients and to the public interest, and are therefore so serious as to be fundamentally incompatible with continued registration.’

She added: ‘Accordingly, the panel has determined that, in order to protect patients, to maintain public confidence in the profession and to declare and uphold proper standards, erasure is a necessary and proportionate sanction in this case.

‘The panel recognises that this removes Dr Leynaud’s ability to practise medicine in the UK but considers that, in all the circumstances, this is an appropriate response to the risks posed by his lack of insight and apparent unwillingness to engage in remediation.

‘The panel has therefore determined to erase Dr Leynaud’s name from the medical register.’

During the 2007 hearing, Leynaud claimed the cases were ‘more complicated’ than the ones he dealt with in France. The surgeon was recruited through Deluca Medical Limited, a French company which sources doctors to provide services in Britain.

Within months of taking up the post his bosses became worried about his rising rate of post-operative complications. An audit of 50 patients found 26 per cent had pre-operative problems compared with the national average of just 7 per cent.

And 40 per cent had post-op complications - almost double the expected rate. It emerged that 20 of Leynaud’s 69 patients had experienced significant problems following surgery.

In one test Leynaud correctly answered 49 out of 135 questions. The minimum for a pass is 90.

Leynaud was not present or represented at his final hearing, but has previously stated in emails to the GMC that he had no intention of returning to Britain.

Ms Mullen said: ‘There is no evidence before the panel to indicate that Dr Leynaud has remedied any of the deficiencies in his performance in any way in the three-year period since the last review was undertaken.

'Dr Leynaud’s professional practice remains deficient'

‘Further, whilst the doctor has given brief details of his work in France there is no independent verification of the standard of his practice.

‘In the absence of any independent evidence that Dr Leynaud’s practice no longer poses a risk to patients, the panel has concluded that Dr Leynaud’s professional practice remains deficient.’

She added: ‘Dr Leynaud’s lack of engagement and insight casts significant doubt upon his willingness to respond positively to the retraining that is required to address his deficiencies.

‘He has failed to appreciate and act upon the findings about his unacceptable performance, which might give rise to harm to patients and to the reputation of the profession.

‘Further, the doctor’s disregard for his obligations in respect of his professional regulator, regardless of the fact that it is, for him, in an overseas jurisdiction, could seriously damage the reputation of the medical profession and undermine public confidence in doctors.’

Leynaud will be struck off the medical register 28 days after he receives notification of the decision, subject to appeal.
