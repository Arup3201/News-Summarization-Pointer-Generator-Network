Remy had failed previous medicals due to problems with his heart and knee but he was surprised by the announcement. 

'I did not understand myself. A problem during the medical examination? I do not know. They put it, that must be it,' he told the Daily Star. 

The Frenchman returned to QPR and appeared in the Premier League before making a move to Chelsea in the final week of the transfer window, where he will now play as back-up to Diego Costa who injured his hamstring on international duty.

Remy, who scored the winner for France against Spain on Thursday, said: 'In my head, I quite wanted to stay at QPR, but I did not hesitate one second to many reasons: for my room for improvement, for my confidence, in terms of level of demand and Chelsea is one of the best clubs in the world. I'm happy to have signed for a club like this.

'I know I'm not going to be the first striker, but nothing is set. I have goals. By signing here, I did not say it was to stay on the sidelines. I will try to move up alongside great players. The rest will happen naturally.'
