Jimmy Anderson has been sensationally cleared of a physical assault on India’s Ravindra Jadeja after an Australian judge took just 10 minutes to throw out all charges against both players.

England’s insistence that nothing serious happened when Anderson and Jadeja clashed at the bottom of the pavilion staircase at Trent Bridge during the first Test was vindicated in highly embarrassing fashion for India.

Gordon Lewis, the hardline Australian judge appointed by the ICC to hear the case, spent six hours listening to evidence from both sides by video link and was then expected to take up to 48 hours to reach his verdict.

Spat: Anderson and Jadeja were embroiled in a row as they left the Trent Bridge pitch

Delight: Anderson cannot hide his emotions after dismissing Jadeja at the Ageas Bowl 

Yet in a development which left India both stunned and angry the judicial commissioner quickly decided there was no case to answer for either player.

It was India who insisted on bringing a highly unusual Level Three charge against Anderson for ‘abusing and pushing’ Jadeja which left him facing a four-Test suspension and expulsion for the rest of a series that England levelled in convincing fashion on Thursday.

They were adamant that Anderson had crossed a line in making physical contact with Jadeja after the players had left the outfield at lunch on the second day of the first Test, raising the stakes and forcing both sides to bring in lawyers.

Yet England’s belief that India’s provocative move was purely tactical to get their best bowler thrown out of the series was backed up by Lewis’s decision to clear Anderson and uphold India’s appeal against a fine levelled against Jadeja. 

Leader of the attack: Anderson was man of the match in England's third Test win at the Ageas Bowl

For fourth Test vs India at Old Trafford, starting on August 7

Cook (c), Ali, Anderson, Ballance,  Bell,  Broad, Buttler (wkt), Jordan, Plunkett, Robson,  Root, Stokes, Woakes.

Matt Prior, Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes, the England players closest to the incident, were the main witnesses for Anderson while India coach Duncan Fletcher, captain MS Dhoni and physio Evan Speechly were in Jadeja’s corner.

Anderson, man of the match in England’s 266-run victory at the Ageas Bowl, was said to be euphoric after having the potentially serious stain on his record which has been hanging over him during the last two Tests removed.

Now, in a huge psychological boost, Anderson will be free to play at his home ground of Old Trafford in next week’s fourth Test after what England will consider almost as big a victory as the one they gained on the field in Southampton over the last week.  

'I'm not going to start judging Jimmy Anderson on everything he does and doesn't do," he said.

'What I will say is that at the moment we celebrate the fact that he's bowling at his best.

'The whole Test, he's been great. But the spell he bowled on the last morning was a real masterclass of swing bowling.

'(It was) on a pitch that was drying, had something in it - but his control of line, length and the decisions he made to put batsmen under pressure was outstanding.'
