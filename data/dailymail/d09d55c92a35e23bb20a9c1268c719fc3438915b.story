Pilot: Richard Pease is accused of being over the drink drive limit while at the helm of a passenger hovercraft travelling to the Isle of Wight

A hovercraft pilot appeared in court today accused of being nearly three times over the drink drive limit while in charge of a busy Isle of Wight passenger vessel.

Richard Pease, 50, fell ill at the helm of the Hovercraft Freedom 90 carrying 36 passengers, leaving one of his colleagues to step in and take over the controls as it travelled from Portsmouth, Hampshire.

Pease, from Cowes, Isle of Wight, was later arrested under the Railway and Transport Safety Act 2003.

Tests allegedly revealed he had 96 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of his breath. The legal drink-drive limit is 35.

He appeared in front of Isle of Wight Magistrates' Court in Newport today charged with driving a motor vehicle while over the alcohol limit and contravening Merchant Shipping regulations by failing to present for duty free from alcohol.

Prosecutor Sunyana Sharma told the court Pease was in 'sole control' of the vessel, which can take up to 127 passengers, as it journeyed to Ryde on the island.

She said Pease was the only person responsible for controlling the vessel during the incident on June 22, 2014.

'The defendant was the master and pilot of the Hovercraft Freedom 90. He is an experienced driver of some 18 years,' she told the court.

'On the day in question...he was the individual in sole control of the hovercraft and driving.'

Pease, who wore a  suit and blue tie as he stood in the dock, did not enter a plea. 

Magistrates adjourned the case and released Pease on unconditional bail for a hearing at Newport Crown Court on September 8. 

Hovertravel, which runs the service, is the world's longest running commercial hovercraft service and is the only scheduled passenger hovercraft service in the Europe.

Hovertravel boasts of offering the fastest way to cross the Solent between Southsea, Portsmouth and Ryde, Isle of Wight, and operates two hovercraft with a frequent service of a journey time of around 10 minutes.

More than 26 million passengers have travelled on the company's hovercrafts since it was established in 1965.
