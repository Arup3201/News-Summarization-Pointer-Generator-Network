Leaping through the air with their claws outstretched, these fearsome felines look like something out of a kung fu movie.

But the mortal tom-cats are really just chasing after and playing with cuddly toys handled by keen photographer and cat-lover Seiji Mamiya.

Mr Mamiya, 39, began snapping pictures of the cats outside his home over a year ago as a way of taking his mind off work.

But as the cats became friendlier and used to his company he realised he could make them jump and began shooting amazing images of them in mid-air.

Mr Mamiya, from Japan, said: 'I take the jump shots by playing with the cat. I shake a toy and when the cat runs towards it I raise the toy upwards.

'Their figure was so graceful so I decided to take pictures. The unusual jump shot cannot be photographed usually and when I looked back at them they looked like ninjas.

Encouragement: Mr Mamiya, from Japan, said: 'I take the jump shots by playing with the cat. I shake a toy and when the cat runs towards it I raise the toy upwards'

'I like their free and natural behaviour and, of course, I also like their lovely faces.

'The images of the cats flying across the skyline and the sun is really stunning.

'In
future I would like to take a jump shot of the moment a big cat is 
hunting in the wild - but I need to find a way of it being less 
dangerous.'
