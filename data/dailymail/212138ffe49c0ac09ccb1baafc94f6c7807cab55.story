As England begin their bid to qualify for Euro 2016 with a tough trip to Switzerland, Sportsmail's Martin Keown assesses where the game could be won and lost by Roy Hodgson's side.

Xherdan Shaqiri vs Leighton Baines 

Known as the 'Alpine Messi', it's no wonder much of Switzerland's hopes are pinned on Xherdan Shaqiri. Despite being the star of this team, the 22-year-old was criticised at the World Cup and is only used as a super sub at his club Bayern Munich.

But he will be a threat. He's got legs like a cyclist and they give him explosive pace. He's technically gifted and he likes cutting in off the flanks.

Leighton Baines will have to be wary dealing with him. If he does cut inside, Baines  has to pass him on to the midfield markers. 

I'd like to see Baines force Shaqiri to go the other way. For Everton he is one of the best attacking full backs in Europe but we've yet to see that for England. He needs to take his club mentality and apply that positivity in a white shirt.

Good going forward: Baines needs to show the attacking intent he does at club level in an England shirt

Johan Djourou vs Danny Welbeck 

Djourou played in every game for Switzerland at the World Cup, so clearly his old coach Ottmar Hitzfeld trusted him.

He’s a converted midfielder and never really looked like a natural centre half, but he improved dramatically when Arsenal sent him on loan and now he is rebuilding his career in Germany. Playing against England he will certainly have a point to prove, but he can be got at.

Danny Welbeck’s  move to Arsenal will give him the confidence he needs to become a main striker. He can use his pace to run off the back of Djourou, but he needs to be more ruthless in front of goal.

On the run: Danny Welbeck (centre) has the pace to trouble Djourou and the rest of Switzerland's defence

Haris Seferovic vs Gary Cahill 

In terms of experience, this is one of the weakest English back fours in living memory, so it’s up to Gary Cahill  to step forward and take charge. 

Neither Baines nor John Stones are very experienced internationally and we still don’t know Phil Jones’s best position. 

Leader: Gary Cahill, pictured tussling with Norway's Havard Nielsen, must command England's back four

Cahill has to lead that unit but it could be a tough night against Haris Seferovic. 

The 22-year-old was largely an impact sub at the World Cup, but he had quite an impact in their opener against Ecuador when he scored an injury-time winner.

Talking tactics

Switzerland's former boss Ottmar Hitzfeld retired after the World Cup. With Vladimir Petkovic now in charge, the Swiss could move from their solid 4-2-3-1 formation to a more attacking 4-3-3. That should make them more fluid and give Xherdan Shaqiri greater licence to roam. 

They claim they are underdogs but I don’t buy that. They had a good World Cup, England did not and the Swiss are at home. This is our toughest game in the group, and the pressure and expectation are on the hosts.

Fresh start: Vladimir Petkovic could employ a more attacking formation than Swiss fans have been used to
