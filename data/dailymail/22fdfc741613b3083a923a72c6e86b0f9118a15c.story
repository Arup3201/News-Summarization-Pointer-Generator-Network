'@natsecwonk': Under an anonymous Twitter account Jofi Joseph bashed his bosses and other Washington elites

The man that was fired from his White House job for making anonymous attacks on administration officials on Twitter may now be investigated for possibly hiring prostitutes.

Jofi Joseph was fired on Tuesday after he was unmasked as the man behind the @NatSecWonk account that had captivated so much of D.C. by taking shots at politicians and hinting of his exclusive knowledge.

Now investigators Joseph, who is married, may be connected to another anonymous account that frequently made mentions of hiring prostitutes.

While Joseph has come forward and put out a statement apologizing for the 'inappropriate and mean-spirited comments' that he made via @NatSecWonk, he made no mention of any connection to the second account, called @DCHobbyist.

That account has now been shut following the swarm of attention, but Foreign Policy reports that it directed a number of tweets at self-identified escorts.

At one point, @DCHobbyist wrote about Toronto's 'tsunami of gorgeous and sensual escorts'.

Just three days later, it directed a message to a woman who identified herself as a 'luxury companion and escort' and wrote 'I hopey ou know that I reminisce fondly about our date. Do let me know if you ever find your way back to DC.'

A second account? Some believe Joseph may be behind this second parody account, and if so, it will be problematic for him as it frequently discusses soliciting prostitutes

If the two accounts are connected, Joseph may face legal problems regarding his alleged use of prostitutes.

Not only is solicitation a crime, but there are political concerns as well since Joseph's wife is a well-respected advisor on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Aside from the moral repercussions of cheating, there is inevitably concern about the prospect of being blackmailed for information or access, based either on his now-former role as a non-proliferation director on the National Security Council or his wife Carolyn Leddy's role in the Senate.

After first refusing to comment to Politico's Glenn Thrush about the scandal when it first broke on Wednesday, saying that it would 'affect his ability to get a new job,' he followed up with a formal statement.

'Beer goggles': Joseph tweeted that Huma Abedin must have been wearing beer goggles when she married Anthony Wiener

International: He also made light of Samantha Powers' marriage to Cass Sunstein before she was appointed as the current American ambassador to the United Nations

'It has been a privilege to serve in this Administration and I deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me,' he said in the statement.

He went on to explain that it 'started out as an intended parody account of DC culture'.

Those comments included insults hurled at Republicans and Democrats alike.

Attacking both sides: NatSecWonk called President Obama's close advisor Valerie Jarrett a 'vacuous cipher' (left) and Republican Sarah Palin 'white trash (right)

'So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family? What utter useless garbage,' he tweeted last October about the former Republican Vice Presidential nominee.

Before Anthony Weiner's first trouble with Twitter that ended his Congressional career, and before Samantha Powers was appointed as the American ambassador to the United Nations, he took aim at their love choices.

'Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Wiener? Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein,' @NatSecWonk tweeted in 2011.

There were serious comments about political connections as well- rather than petty personal jabs.

'I'm a fan of Obama, but his continuing reliance and dependence upon a vacuous cipher like Valerie Jarrett concerns me,' he said of the President's longtime friend and advisor.

'More people should be asking why John Kerry installed two former aides, both with ZERO foreign policy experience, into top posts at State,' he also wrote.
