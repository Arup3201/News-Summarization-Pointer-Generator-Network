A rock band that split in 1965 has reformed almost 50 years later - after discovering one of the members wasn't dead after all.

The Hustlers lost touch after breaking up in 1965 and even wrongly thought that one of the members had died.

But the group, now thought to be the country's oldest rock and roll band with all its original members, is back and playing gigs.

Then: The Hustlers, pictured in 1963, lost touch after breaking up in 1965 and even wrongly thought that one of the members had died

Now: The group are now back and playing gigs together almost 50 years after they split up

The group formed in Brighton in 1960 and played at youth clubs around Sussex but split five years later as several members were getting married.

The band includes lead singer Tony Burchell, 72, lead guitarist Barry Gillam, 73, bassist Richard Pearce, 69, Pete Dresch, 70, and drummer Ken White, 67.

Over the years the friends lost touch and when lead singer Mr Burchell celebrated his 50th birthday he tried to contact the others on a radio station in Brighton.

A caller phoned in and claimed that drummer Ken had passed away.

However, 22 years later, the band members found each other on a 1960s Brighton bands' website only to realise that Mr White was very much alive and well.

Bassist Mr Pearce, an upholsterer from Netley, Hampshire, was delighted when the group got back together.

Rehearsal: The group played their first gig back together at the Ye John Selden pub in Worthing and are playing a variety of venues along the south coast. Pictured is singer Tony Burchell

He said: 'It's amazing to be back together - we just started laughing because 45 years had gone and we remember it all.

'Nobody has changed that much - we've all grown older, but we haven't changed a great deal in looks. We all instantly recognised each other.'

The group played its first gig back together at the Ye John Selden pub in Worthing and is playing a variety of venues along the south coast.

Mr Pearce said: 'Most of our applause comes from the fact that we can stand up for two hours unaided.

Rock 'n' roll: Bassist Richard Pearce and drummer Ken White are two of the original members of the band, which first formed in 1960

'We enjoy ourselves and hope the audience does too.'

The band performs covers of classic rock and roll hits of the late 1950s and early 1960s such as songs by Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and Cliff Richard.

They said that, although there are other older bands like the Rolling Stones, they believe it's unique to have the same line-up as they did before.

The men still know 70 songs and revealed that it keeps their minds active.

Back from the dead: The band nearly reformed 22 years ago, but were wrongly told that their drummer had died

Richard added: 'The fact we can still do what we do is great - we may be old but we can still rock and roll.'

The band now play for charity in pubs along the south coast at least once a month.

And the bassist didn't rule out playing at festivals this summer.

He joked: 'We'd love to get an offer from one of the big festivals this year - hopefully Glastonbury.'
