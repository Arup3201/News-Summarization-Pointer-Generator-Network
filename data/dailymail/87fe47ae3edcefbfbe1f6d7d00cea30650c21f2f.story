Comedian Jim Davidson has been arrested again by detectives 
investigating the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal following further 
allegations of sex offences.

The 59-year-old answered bail today after he was held in January by detectives working on Operation Yewtree, the national investigation prompted by the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal.

Further allegations have been made after he was arrested for other allegations in January.

Comedian Jim Davidson is understood to have been arrested as part of Operation Yewtree

A Scotland Yard spokesman said a 59-year-old man had been 'further arrested on suspicion of sexual offences in connection with further allegations made to Operation Yewtree'.

A Met Police spokesman said: 'The man was arrested in west London on suspicion of sexual offences and taken to a London police station. He was later bailed to return pending further inquiries - next due on a date in May.

'The individual falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed "others".'

Operation Yewtree has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'.

At the time of his first arrest in January, Davidson's solicitor Henri Brandman issued a statement to say he 'vigorously denied' the allegations.

The five-times married comedian was detained at Heathrow Airport in January after landing to take part in Celebrity Big Brother, which he said left him 'completely gobsmacked'.

Speaking in January, the comedian 'vigorously denied’ the allegations, which date back around 25 years and said that he had never forced himself on a woman in his life.

The former Big Break and Generation Game host 'vigorously denies' the allegations made against him, his solicitor said tonight following the star's re-arrest for further alleged sex offences.

And tonight, his solicitor Henri Brandman said his client 'vigorously denies' all the allegations against him.

Mr Brandman said: 'Jim vigorously denies the allegations.

'He has not been charged with any offence. Neither he nor I will be making a further comment.' 

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
