French intelligence has alleged that the Syrian regime launched an attack on August 21 involving 'massive use of chemical agents' which killed 281 people and that it could carry out other strikes of a similar nature in the future.

The government published a nine-page synopsis today about Syria's alleged chemical weapons program that found at least 281 deaths could be attributed to the attack in areas outside Damascus.

The analysis is based in part from dozens of videos culled by French intelligence services.

President Francois Hollande has backed a call from President Barack Obama for a military strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad's government in retaliation for the attack.

Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault hosted lawmakers, his defense and foreign ministers, and intelligence and security officials on today to discuss Syria.

Having announced over the weekend that he will seek congressional approval for military strikes against the Assad regime, President Obama's administration is now trying to rally support among Americans and their congressmen and senators.

A meeting with Senator John McCain is meant to address concerns of those who feel Obama isn't doing enough to punish Syrian President Bashar Assad's government for an attack in the Damascus suburbs last month that the U.S. says included sarin gas and killed at least 1,429 civilians, more than 400 of whom were children.

On the other side of the spectrum, some Republican and Democratic lawmakers don't want to see military action at all.

Obama's turnabout on Syria sets the stage for the biggest foreign policy vote in Congress since the Iraq war.

On Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. received new physical evidence in the form of blood and hair samples that shows sarin gas was used in the August 21 attack.

Kerry said the U.S. must respond with its credibility on the line.

'We know that the regime ordered this attack,' he said. 'We know they prepared for it. We know where the rockets came from. We know where they landed. We know the damage that was done afterwards.'

Kerry's assertion coincided with the beginning of a forceful administration appeal for congressional support.

On Capitol Hill, senior administration officials briefed lawmakers in private to explain why the U.S. was compelled to act against Assad.

Obama is trying to convince Americans and the world about the need for action.

So far, he is finding few international partners willing to engage in a conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives in the past two years and dragged in terrorist groups on both sides of the battlefield.

Only France is firmly on board among the major military powers. Britain's Parliament rejected the use of force in a vote last week.

With Navy ships on standby in the eastern Mediterranean ready to launch missiles, Congress on Sunday began a series of meetings that are expected to continue over the next several days in preparation for a vote once lawmakers return from summer break, which is scheduled to end September 9.

Meanwhile Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says the information the U.S. showed Moscow trying to prove that the Syrian regime was behind an alleged chemical weapons attack is 'absolutely unconvincing.'

Lavrov said Monday 'there was nothing specific' in the evidence presented by Washington: 'no geographic coordinates, no names, no proof that the tests were carried out by the professionals.'

He did not say what tests he was referring to.

Lavrov say U.S. officials said they cannot share with them all the evidence because some of it is classified.

Today Russia's foreign minister said evidence of alleged chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime presented to Moscow by the U.S. and its allies is 'absolutely unconvincing'.

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said 'there was nothing specific there, no geographic coordinates, no names, no proof that the tests were carried out by the professionals.'

He did not describe the tests further.

Lavrov brushed aside Western evidence of an alleged Syrian regime role. Russia, along with China and Iran, has staunchly backed Assad throughout the conflict.

'What our American, British and French partners showed us in the past and have showed just recently is absolutely unconvincing,' Lavrov said at Russia's top diplomatic school.

'And when you ask for more detailed proof they say all of this is classified so we cannot show this to you.'

U.N. chemical inspectors toured the stricken areas last week, collecting biological and soil samples, but it is not clear when the will present their findings.

The Syria conflict erupted in March 2011 as an uprising against Assad that quickly transformed into a civil war.

More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed in the conflict.
