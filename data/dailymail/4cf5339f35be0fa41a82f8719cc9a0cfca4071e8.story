A big-busted cookery teacher who hoped to solve her back pain problems by having a breast reduction was left with a body she hated after surgery went disastrously wrong.Â 

Anne, 57, went under the knife ten years ago to reduce the size of her 32FF chest, but the botched operation left her with nipples placed abnormally high - so high she couldn't even find a bra to cover them.

Ann felt so self-conscious that she even began undressing in the dark so her husband Paul couldn't see what had happened to her body. She says she 'felt like a freak'.

She explained: 'My nipples look like they've been plonked on too high. It's a complete nightmare. I pop out of everything I put on'

Botch job: Reduction surgery left Anne with lopsided breasts and 'abnormally' positioned nipples

One
 decade later Ann mustered the courage to write in to TLC show Extreme 
Body Disasters, begging them to redo the operation. And after a 
successful operation she is finally happy with the way she looks.

Speaking
 about the trauma of the first operation, Ann said: 'I always had big 
breasts and I hated them. After I had children, they 
got bigger, and then they dropped and were virtually around my waist. My
 posture was terrible, I suffered from terrible back problems and 
eventually, I felt, well, enough is enough and I can't carry on like 
this.'

Supported by husband Paul, they dipped into their savings and pension so Anne could have the cosmetic procedure.

'This was a dream come true - at long last, I thought I was going to be 
normal. But when the bandages were taken off, I couldn't believe my 
eyes,' Anne said.

Anne had been left with lopsided nipples that were abnormally high. Not only did this make her self-conscious in front of her husband, it also made it difficult for her to find underwear that was high enough to cover them.

She explained: 'My nipples look like they've been plonked on too high. It's a complete nightmare. I pop out of everything I put on.

'It makes me feel really unsexy. I hate myself and I'm always aware of 
it every day and I just hate my body. I've just been left looking like a
 freak.'

They pop out: The mother said she couldn't find bras to cover her high nipples

She continued: 'I won't let my husband see me naked. I get dressed and undressed in the dark or turn round.'

Anne applied to TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters to see if their resident surgeon Dr Vik Vijh could salvage her appearance following the botched operation.

Dr Vijh explained how the surgery went wrong because the surgeon positioned the nipples 'higher on the breast mound than they should be'.

This then caused 'bottoming out' - which occurs when the skin that was stitched together during the operation can no longer 
support the weight of the chest and gravity takes hold. The breasts descent 
but the nipples don't.

Fixed: Anne went on Extreme Beauty Disasters and had another op to reposition her nipples which she is delighted with

'It never ceases to amaze me when I see appalling surgeries but it makes me more determined to sort them out,' Dr Vijh said.

Dr Vijh operates on Anne to redress the previous problem and this time, she is delighted with the end result.

She said: 'I can wear a bra, I can wiggle around and nothing's popping out! They're perfect. It's changed the whole way I feel about myself, my confidence, my posture - it means so much to me.'

She added: 'I feel feminine, I feel sexy, I'm a lot more confident than I ever was, I'm happy to wear low tops and it's just made so much difference to me.'

Extreme Beauty Disasters is on TLC Thursdays at 8pm
