Blind Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng today appealed to be granted asylum in the U.S. - and begged to be allowed to leave with his family on Hillary Clinton's plane.

He said he feared for their lives should they remain in China, despite assurances they would be allowed to 'live free', and pleaded for a lift when the U.S. Secretary of State leaves after two days of strategic talks tomorrow.

The self-taught lawyer's plea has thrown into doubt the agreement used to coax him out of hiding from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing - and fanned U.S.-China tensions at a sensitive time.

Plea: Chen Guangcheng (left) wants to leave on U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's (right) plane

Tricky: The diplomatic row could now have come at a worse time for Hillary Clinton (left), who is in China for two days of strategic talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao (right)

The stand-off appears particularly troublesome for the Obama administration, with Chen saying he now fears for his and his family's safety if he stays in China, as was planned under the deal that Washington called a good outcome for the dissident.    

China's Foreign Ministry declined to comment on Chen's request to leave the country and repeated its criticism of the way the United States had handled the issue as 'unacceptable'.    

Chen, a self-taught legal activist, left the U.S. Embassy yesterday and is now under Chinese control in a Beijing hospital.

He had taken refuge at the U.S. mission for six days after escaping house arrest and left after U.S. officials assured him Beijing had promised to improve his circumstances.    

But Chen said yesterday by telephone from hospital, where he was escorted by U.S. officials and was being treated for a broken foot, that he had changed his mind after speaking to his wife who spoke of recent threats made against his family.    

He said: 'I feel very unsafe. My rights and safety cannot be assured here.' His family, who were with him at the hospital, backed his decision to try to reach America, he added.

And he told thedailybeast.com: 'My fervent hope is that it would be possible for me and my family to leave for the U.S. on Hillary Clinton's plane.

'I hope to seek medical treatment in the U.S. with my family, and then I want to rest. As for the future, we’ll deal with that in the future.'

A Republican congressman has accused Barack Obama's administration of trying to sweep concerns over Chen Guangcheng 'off the table' for 'happy' diplomatic photos.

Chris Smith, for New Jersey, told FoxNews.com he has not spoken to Chen, who reportedly has asked for his help in leaving China.

But he said the U.S. should 'without a doubt' revisit his case and consider granting him asylum, as conflicting reports emerge about the safety of him and his family.

Smith said: 'There is no safe place in China if you’re a dissident. It doesn’t exist. It’s an oxymoron. I think we missed an opportunity to press for asylum.'

The activist, citing descriptions from his wife, Yuan Weijing, said his family had been surrounded by Chinese officials who menaced them and filled the family home.

Chen, from a village in rural Shandong province, has two children.

He said: 'When I was inside the American Embassy, I didn't have my family, and so I didn't understand some things. After I was able to meet them, my ideas changed.'

A senior U.S. official later said the United States was seeking to clarify Chen's wishes and continued to discuss his fate with the Chinese government.     

The official said: 'When we feel that we have a clear view of what his final decision is, we will do what we can to help him achieve that.'

The timing of the Chen case comes at a fragile time for both nations.

U.S. President Barack Obama will be 
sensitive to any criticism of the handling of Chen in the run-up to a 
November presidential election.

China is struggling to push through its own leadership change late this year.    

That
carefully choreographed transition has already been wrong-footed by the
downfall of ambitious senior Communist Party official Bo Xilai after he
was caught up in a scandal linked to the apparent murder of British 
businessman Neil Heywood.

Free: Chen Guangcheng's departure from the embassy came shortly after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Beijing for two days of annual strategic talks

Harassed: Mr Chen (right) says that he and his family have been abused while under house arrest

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton found herself in the eye of the diplomatic storm today, turning up for the opening of annual bilateral talks in Beijing which have been overshadowed, but not derailed, by the Chen case.    

She used the occasion to urge China to protect human rights but made no specific mention of Chen, whom she had spoken to yesterday after he left the embassy.    

He reportedly told her 'I want to kiss you', as he thanked her for America's support in brokering the initial deal.

'Of course, as part of our dialogue, the United States raises the importance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,' Clinton said.

Family: Mr Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, was supposedly beaten by government guards and their daughter, Kesi, was harassed

Human rights: Mr Chen (right) met with the wife of a different human rights activist earlier this month while in his home, and he supposedly planned the escape for weeks by pretending he was sick

'We believe all governments have to answer our citizens' aspirations for dignity and the rule of law and that no nation can or should deny those rights.'

Despite Chen's change of heart about staying in China, it was unclear if he would be able to travel to the United States.     

U.S. officials appeared no longer to be with him today, with the dissident saying he had still not had an opportunity to explain his change of heart to the U.S. side.    

'I hope the U.S. will help me leave immediately. I want to go there for medical treatment,' Chen said from the hospital, where a pack of camera crews and reporters was waiting outside, kept away from the entrance by police.     

Washington had hoped its deal with Beijing over Chen would defuse the crisis, with both Clinton and U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in the Chinese capital for this week's talks - in which the United States will aim to secure more cooperation from China on trade and international flashpoints such as North Korea, Iran and Syria.    

Under the deal, according to U.S. officials, Chen and his family would have been relocated within the country in safety and he would have been allowed to pursue his studies.

Still in custody: Mr Chen escaped on his own and is calling for an investigation into the treatment of his family

But Chinese authorities have taken a tough tone, criticising what they called U.S. meddling and demanding an apology for the way U.S. diplomats handled the case.    

Chinese President Hu Jintao made no mention of the Chen case in his remarks to the U.S.-China talks but stressed that the two nations needed trust.    

'It is impossible for China and the United States to see eye-to-eye on every issue, but both sides must know how to respect each other,' he said.    

Earlier, in comments aired on CNN, Chen said: 'I would like to say to President Obama, please do everything you can to get our family out.'

Chen, 40, is a legal activist who campaigned against forced abortions under China's 'one-child' policy.

He escaped 19 months of house arrest, during which he and his family faced beatings and threats, late last month.    

U.S. officials had said Chen left the embassy of his own free will because he wanted to be reunited with his wife and children.

They said he wanted to remain in China and never asked for asylum.

Chen's dramatic escape from house arrest and his flight last week to the U.S. Embassy have made him a symbol of resistance to China's shackles on dissent.

The deal struck by Beijing and Washington would have kept him an international test case of how tight or loose those restrictions remain.    

Now, however, his change of mind throws not only his own future into doubt, but also raises questions about the wider U.S.-China relationship.    

It could also prove politically costly for Obama, who has already been accused of being soft on China by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and who could now face further criticism over Chen's case.    

What initially appeared to be a foreign policy success for the Obama administration could quickly turn into a liability.
