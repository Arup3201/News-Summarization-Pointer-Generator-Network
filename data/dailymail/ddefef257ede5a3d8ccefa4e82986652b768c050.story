Madonna called herself the Material Girl and now there is an 82-year-old pensioner from London who could easily claim the title of Material Boy.

The retired electrical engineer  - who wishes to remain anonymous - has published a book of selfies where his body and head are entirely draped in cloaks and sheets.  

The man, who refers to himself only as 2041 (the number of covered-up selfies he has taken) is indulging in a rare fetish that he has labelled 'concealateurism'.

An 82-year-old pensioner from London enjoys concealing all of his body parts in material. The ex-electrical engineer is obsessed with the feeling of velvet and silk on skin and has released a book of covered selfies

He spends hours at home alone dressing up in cloaks, niqabs, satin sheets and scarves because he likes the texture on his skin and the privacy it gives him. 

He said: 'It is total coverage so that no part of me shows and so that I live in complete privacy and anonymity.

'I am hidden from the world. I never see the world, or ever touch anything, except through layers of fine material. 

'This is my purdah; I love it and having to take any of it off is quite painful for me.'

The man, known as Mr 2041 spends hours at home alone dressing up in cloaks, niqabs, satin sheets and scarves because he likes the texture on his skin and the privacy it gives him.

He continued: ''The materials generally used for my costumes are silks, satins and velvets, so that not only is my privacy preserved but I exist inside them in the greatest luxury, with fine materials touching almost every inch of me. 

'None of the lovely things I wear are constricting, except purely to ensure that they remain in place.

'Hands, feet, head and face are entirely free but covered so that no part of any of them are ever visible.'

Mr 2041 claims that although his concealateurism is a fetish, he gets no sexual excitement from the habit. 

It is an obsession that he developed almost 70 years ago, when he started dressing up as a choir boy in his early teens

By his late teens, Mr 2041 had progressed to 'wrapping' himself up entirely

It isan obsession that he developed almost 70 years ago, when he started dressing up as a choir boy in his early teens.

By his late teens, he had progressed to 'wrapping' himself up entirely. 

He said: 'A joy from many years ago is a white sports shirt, worn back to front with neckline round my forehead. 

'It is in a very fine polyester material and there is a tiny hole in the back, through which I can just see with one eye, the rest of my face being completely and heavily covered.'

The man never walks the streets  covered in sheets, preferring to indulge in his habit in the privacy of his own home.

But he does occasionally visit a fetish club dressed in the swathes of material, where he meets up with fellow ‘concealteurs’.

Mr 2041 believes that dressing the way that he does is actually a less sexual way of behaving than most members of the general public, who wear normal clothes. 

He claims that by covering himself up entirely, he is not communicating with people based on appearance. 

He said: 'In the West we are very prone to judge each other on our appearance. The beautiful girl, for instance, is whistled in the street and chatted up, and the plain is ignored.

'If everybody is dressed anonymously, then if you’re going to indulge in conversation it doesn’t matter what you look like - this would be a social good I would suggest.'

In an effort to share his story with others, Mr 2041 has now published a book with Here Press that features a number of pictures of himself covered in material.

He said: 'Roll on the day when it is acceptable for everyone, to have the opportunity to live their lives in flamboyant, luxurious secrecy.'
