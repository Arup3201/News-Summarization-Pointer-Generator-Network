Gone: Detective Chief Inspector Heather Eastwood has resigned from her post at Cleveland Police after she was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly

The detective wife of the first British chief constable to be sacked in 35 years has resigned herself after being held on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly.

Detective Chief Inspector Heather Eastwood had faced an Police Complaints Commission's hearing following an allegation she had failed to inform her superiors of the arrest two years ago.

Ms Eastwood's husband, Sean Price, served as Cleveland's Chief Constable from 2003 until last October when he was dismissed for gross misconduct.

His wife will no longer face any disciplinary action now she has quit her job at the same force.

The former officer, who married Mr Price last year, was arrested at Northallerton railway station in 2011.

She was questioned and later released with no further action taken.

Following an investigation, the alleged incident was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission by Cleveland Police and Cleveland Police Authority in May last year.

A force spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that a Chief Inspector who was due to face a misconduct hearing has now resigned from the Force.

'As the individual is no longer a serving police officer they are no longer subject to disciplinary proceedings.'

It is not clear yet if she will keep her pension, but in most cases an officer who resigns will.

A spokesman for the IPCC confirmed that details of its investigation would be released as soon as possible.

Avoided: Heather Eastwood's decision to resign means that she escapes disciplinary action

He said: 'As the force has accepted the resignation of the officer there was no need for the hearing to proceed. However, we will publish the findings of the investigation once we are legally able to do so.'

Ms Eastwood's husband, Mr Price, served as Cleveland's Chief Constable from 2003 until last October when he was dismissed for gross misconduct.

He was found guilty of asking a
colleague to inquire about a job for the former police authority 
chairman's daughter and subsequently lying about it.

He was arrested in August 2011 and later dismissed from his £191,905 job, where he had been suspended on full pay.

His sacking also meant he escaped a 
further inquiry into claims that he abused his force credit card and 
concealed the arrest of his wife.

In March, Cleveland's former Deputy Chief Constable Derek Bonnard was dismissed for gross misconduct on six counts.

Mr Bonnard denied any wrongdoing and planned to appeal against the ruling, however, earlier this week it emerged he had reached a settlement with the  force over disputed wages paid during his suspension and dropped the challenge.

As a result he will not now pursue an appeal against the dismissal or an action claiming sexual discrimination.
