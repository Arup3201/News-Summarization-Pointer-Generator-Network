It was  an unlikely place to find a treasure trove of exquisite antiques.

When auctioneer Martin Lawrence was called to the rundown two-bedroomed council flat following the death of the elderly man who lived there, he expected no more than a routine valuation of humdrum household items.

But it didn’t take long for him to realise that he was in for a treat.

Antique: A 170-year-old hand-carved bowl from an American tribe that was found abandoned in a kitchen cupboard in the home in Southsea, Hampshire

Prized: The Chinese jade fish ornament and the 1796 solid silver trophy presented to a captain of Nelson's navy

For among the items buried under boxes of
junk was a 170-year-old Native American bowl which was to sell at 
auction for £70,000.

A 2ft solid silver trophy presented to a captain of Nelson’s navy in 1796, found under a bed, fetched more than £10,000.

In all, the hoard was to raise £250,000 at auction.

One man's rubbish... A Cased Pair of Mid 19th Century Percussion Belt Pistols by Bond which fetched £3,400

Hoard: A collection of early gramophones, spare parts and accessories which made £7,000

Mr Lawrence went to the flat in Southsea, Hampshire, following the death of a man in his 80s last year.

He was faced with piles of old 
newspapers, cardboard boxes and old mattresses obstructing entire rooms 
but by the end of the clearing operation   300 antiques had been 
unearthed.

Mr Lawrence, of Jacobs & Hunt 
auctioneers in Petersfield, Hampshire, said: ‘It was meant to be a 
straightforward probate of the contents but it became apparent as we 
started that this was something quite special.

Grim: The tower block where the pensioner lived in a squalid two-bedroom property which was covered in rubbish, and, right, a fine quality Tiffany & Co. sterling silver flask, of oval form

‘The items were either stuffed in 
boxes, left in sideboards and cupboards, lying on the floor or under the
bed and in almost every nook and cranny.’

Other pieces that were sold 
at auction last month included a Chinese jade ornament in the shape of a
fish worth £12,000.

A pair of 19th century pistols sold for £3,400 and an 18-carat white gold diamond ring went for £2,600.

The pensioner who lived in the flat is
thought to have inherited the collection from his parents who were 
well-known antique dealers in London at the time of the Second World 
War.

Discarded: An Early Tribal Carving in the form of a figure together with an Early Tribal Pillow, fetched £13,500

Mr Lawrence said: ‘You could just tell
the collection had been in the same place for many years. A neighbour 
said he was a nice man but they had no idea of what his flat was like.’

The star item, which attracted bids 
from collectors in Canada, New York and Australia, was the Native 
American bowl, carved into the shape of a seal.

It would have been used 
by the Haida tribe to serve rich foods at feasts in the early to 
mid-19th century.

Mr Lawrence said: ‘It was kept in the back of a kitchen cupboard and luckily hadn’t been used for many years.’
