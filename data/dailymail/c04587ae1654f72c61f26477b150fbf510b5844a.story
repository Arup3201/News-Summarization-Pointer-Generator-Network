Tom Brokaw, 75, will release a new memoir about his battle with cancer, titled A Lucky Life Interrupted

Tom Brokaw has announced he will share the story about his battle with cancer in a new memoir titled A Lucky Life Interrupted. 

Brokaw, 75, drew upon a journal he began keeping in late 2013 after he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer in the bone marrow's white blood cells.

The retired NBC anchor said he hopes the book will help others who have to deal 'with this unwelcome condition,' in a statement he released through publisher Random House. 

The book will be released May 12.  

Brokaw remained private through much of his cancer treatment, publicly announcing he had cancer only six months after he was diagnosed. 

During an interview with David Letterman, Brokaw said he was 'pleased with the progress' of his treatment but that's as far as he would go in describing his fight with the disease.

'There are a lot of other people out there...going through what I'm going through, and they don't have the advantages I do,' he told the talk show host, according to The Hollywood Reporter. 

Brokaw, who told Letterman his work was 'therapy', continued to work throughout his treatment, serving as a special NBC correspondent and contributing to the network's winter Olympics coverage in Sochi last year.  

In September Brokaw revealed on the Today Show that the cancer was almost gone, although he recognized that 'the disease will not completely go away' but can be 'managed'.

Three months later Brokaw announced that he was officially in remission and that he would be going on a drug maintenance regimen 'to keep it there', he said in a note to his 'NBC family' that was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. 

Brokaw served as the head anchor for NBC Nightly News for 23 years before he retired and passed the chair to Brian Williams in 2004. 

He remained mostly silent during the controversy surrounding Williams' story about his experience in the Iraq war and released a statement that said the anchor's fate was in both Williams and NBC's hands.

Brokaw continues to serve as a special correspondent for NBC and has written seven other books.
