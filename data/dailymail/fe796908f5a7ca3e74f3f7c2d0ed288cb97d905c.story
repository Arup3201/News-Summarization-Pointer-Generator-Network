A silent electric bike is to be used by police forces as a means to approach criminals undetected.

Zero Motorcycles in northern California have designed their a motorcycle that law enforcement officials can use to get the upper hand on criminals.

And with a top speed of up to 98 miles (158 km) per hour, the police of tomorrow can chase criminals down as well if the stealth approach fails.

California-based Zero Motorcycles are releasing an electric bike for police (shown). It takes between six and 9.9 hours to charge depending on the model and weighs up to 473 pounds (215 kg)

Zero Motorcycles are known for their range of bikes for personal use, but this range is the first that has been developed for use by police forces.

It follows in the footsteps of a similar bike, the MMX, which is an off-road bike designed for use by the military in addition to the police.

Top speed: 98 miles (158 km) per hour

Range*: Up to 151 miles (243 km)

Charging time*: Between six and 9.9 hours

Weight*: 396 to 473 pounds: (180 to 215 kg)

Equivalent fuel economy: 408 miles to the gallon (0.58 litres per 100 km)

Cost to recharge*: $0.96 to $1.60

*Depending on model

This police bike, however, is intended to be used by law enforcement in urban locations and, owing to its silent engine, it could enable them to be safer and more discreet while on the job.

According to BBC Future the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is evaluating the use of such electric motorcycles for its officers.

'There are quite a few attributes that make these bikes appealing to the police and military,' Abe Askenazi, chief technology officer for Zero Motorcycles, told BBC Future.

‘They’re quiet; they’re very stealthy.’

There are two bikes being rolled out for law enforcement services: The Zero SP and the DSP.

The former is intended solely for street usage, while the later can be used both on and off road.

With a range of 164 miles (264 km) on one charge, the city bike should suit police operating in urban environments quite comfortably.

Each bike is devoid of a loud and polluting combustion engine, meaning they can creep up on people without alerting them or enter a dangerous location undetected.

The matter of cost is also important: after the initial outlay, upwards of £10,650 ($17,900), it is said a single charge costs about 60p ($1)

‘There are major benefits to incorporating these environmentally friendly motorcycles,’ said Officer Steve Carbajal of the LAPD Off-Road Unit in a statement.

‘It costs less than 50 cents to charge compared to using gallons of gas, maintenance is simple, and the community appreciates how quiet they are.’

‘Most importantly, our officers have an added tactical advantage while on patrol.’

The bike boasts a top speed of 98 mph and has a range of more than 150 miles. There are two models available for police officials, one just for street use (shown) and another for on and off-road driving

And it’s not just the police that are taking note of the bike - a military version called the MMX is also garnering attention.

Designed for more rugged use off-road, the bike boasts two separate batteries than can easily be replaced and a simple electric motor drive.

And it even has an ‘override’ switch, that can be pressed when a biker is in danger such as being shot at.

This will nullify any safety systems allowing for extra speed, albeit at the risk of damaging the bike.

It’s also equipped with infrared lights for night vision.

For the police and military of the future, it might be bikes like these that give them the edge when it comes to stopping criminals.
