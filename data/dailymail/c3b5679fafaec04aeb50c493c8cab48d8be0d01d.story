I didn’t realise I finished second in Canada until AFTER the race (I thought it was a lot worse than that!) and Germany are favourites to win in Brazil

Formula One championship leader Nico Rosberg again spearheaded a practice one-two for Mercedes as the sport made its long-awaited return to Austria.

Situated in the Styrian mountains, the Red Bull Ring - owned by billionaire energy drinks magnate Dietrich Mateschitz - is an old-school circuit complemented by modern-day facilities following a £60million revamp.

The track itself, last used in F1 in 2003, has remained unaltered since that visit 11 years ago, much to the delight of the drivers.

Eyes on the prize: The German is 22 points ahead of Lewis Hamilton in the race for the Formula One title

At just a fraction over two miles it is the third shortest circuit on the current calendar behind Monaco and Interlagos in Brazil, but provides the fastest lap.

Come the end of the opening 90-minute session it was Rosberg who led the way with a time of one minute 11.295secs, three seconds off the pace of Michael Schumacher's race lap record set in 2003.

Hamilton, 22 points adrift of Rosberg in the drivers' standings in the wake of his retirement in Canada a fortnight ago when the German was second to debut race-winner Daniel Ricciardo, was 0.140secs adrift.

Three other drivers also completed a lap under 72 seconds, led by the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso, followed by Felipe Massa in his Williams.

Trail: Hamilton was slower than his team-mate in Friday's opening practice session

Jenson Button's McLaren, resplendent with a number of upgrades this weekend, fared strongly to claim fifth spot on the timesheet with a lap of 1:11.839secs.

Force India's Sergio Perez was also in close attendance, less than three quarters of a second behind Rosberg, with team-mate Nico Hulkenberg and Williams' Valtteri Bottas also within a second of the on-song German.

McLaren's Kevin Magnussen and Jean-Eric Vergne in his Toro Rosso completed the top 10, both marginally over a second down, along with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen and the second Toro Rosso of Daniil Kvyat.

Marussia's Max Chilton was 19th, 2.5secs adrift, with Sauber's Adrian Sutil and Caterham's Marcus Ericsson bringing up the rear, albeit with only nine and eight laps respectively to their name due to technical issues.

As for Sebastian Vettel, it was another tough day in the cockpit of his Red Bull as the reigning four-times champion narrowly missed a smash into a barrier on the opposite side of the pit wall.Coming out of the final corner, Vettel caught the grass and twice spun through 360 degrees, avoiding the barrier by inches.

Remarkably, the car ended up back on the circuit and pointing in the right direction, although Vettel finished the session down in 15th, 1.7secs off compatriot Rosberg.
