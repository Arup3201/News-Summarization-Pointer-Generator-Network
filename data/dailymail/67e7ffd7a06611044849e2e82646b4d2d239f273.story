A 23-year-old mother admitted to being high on marijuana the day her 4-year-old son was killed in a house fire in Keizer, Oregon.

At a Monday court hearing, prosecutors also revealed that Niya Sosa-Martinez was previously convicted of child neglect in 2012, involving her son Andre and 6-year-old daughter who was at school when their home caught fire on Friday. 

Sosa-Martinez remained expressionless in court, though she did tear up when she was formally charged with second-degree manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child.

Tragedy: Niya Sosa-Martinez (left) was charged on Monday with second-degree manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child after her 4-year-old son Andre (right) was killed in a house fire 

Devastating: The family's home in Keizer, Oregon erupted in flames Friday afternoon while Sosa-Martinez's other 6-year-old daughter was at school. Andre became trapped in the house and firefighters were not able to save him 

The Marion County District Attorney says Sosa-Martinez confessed to being high on marijuana the afternoon her home in the Susan Court Apartment erupted in flames.

Investigators have not yet released the cause of the fire, but  prosecutors say they have enough evidence to prove Sosa Martinez recklessly caused the death of her son.  

Neighbors also gave conflicting reports on Sosa-Martinez's behavior as firefighters tried and failed to save her son. 

'The worst part about it, she didn't show any emotions,' neighbor Dianne Petrovich told Fox 12. 'She went over and sat in the gazebo and was texting on her phone while everybody was trying to get in and get her child.'

Father in prison: Sosa-Martinez's unidentified 6-year-old daughter has been placed in foster care. The father of the two children is currently in prison for sex abuse 

Terrible loss: A neighbor described Andre as a 'happy little guy'. 'It's just sad, makes you want to cry,' neighbor Lillian Miller said. 

No bail: Sosa-Martinez was held without bond and is due back in court next month

Another neighbor, who wished to remain anonymous told KGW: ''She didn't even seem distraught,' he said. 'It was like she didn't care. She was on her phone, looking at her house burn, not screaming, not crying.' 

But another neighbor said the mother was clearly upset. 

'The mother was out there just hysterical,' neighbor Jacob Alvis told KOIN. 'I mean she was just so upset, rightfully so.''

Sosa-Martinez's daughter has since been placed in foster care. 

The father of the two children is currently in prison for sex abuse. 

A neighbor described 4-year-old Andre as 'a happy little guy'. 

'It's just sad, makes you want to cry,' neighbor Lillian Miller said. 

Public records indicate that Sosa-Martinez was convicted of child neglect in 2011, for an incident involving Andre and her daughter. 

At the time, Sosa-Martinez plead guilty 

Her lengthy criminal record also contains convictions for theft and marijuana possession. 

A judge ordered Sosa-Martinez held without bond on Monday. She is due back in court for a preliminary hearing on November 3.
