Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina leveled the most direct attacks on Hillary Clinton during the annual Conservative Political Action Conference's opening day, challenging her to outline what she got done in her years in the U.S. Senate and at the helm of the State Department.

'Mrs. Clinton, name an accomplishment,' Fiorina said Thursday in Maryland, bringing a red-meat crowd of Republican partisans to their feet.

'And in the meantime, please explain why we should accept that the millions and millions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments don’t represent a conflict of interest.'

That jab was a reference to news on Tuesady that the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation had received – and would continue to accept – untold million in donations from Middle Eastern goverments including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman. 

'She tweets about women’s rights in this country and takes money from governments that deny women the most basic human rights,' the fired up pol said, her voice peaking.

'NAME AN ACCOMPLISHMENT!': Carly FIorina is taking on Hillary Clinton, daring her to list thigns she did right in the Senate and at the State Department

LEXINGTON ON THE POTOMAC: William Temple of the Golden Isles Tea Party in Georgia came to the CPAC event dressed as Declaration of Independence signer Button Gwinnett – one of a cast of colorful characters in Maryland to fire up America's political right wing

UNLOCK YOUR THESAURUS: Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting, told attendees of the Watermark Silicon Valley Conference for Women that they should be empowered to 'unlock their full potential' – a line Fiorina has used over and over again

'She tweets about equal pay for women but won’t answer basic questions about her own offices’ pay standards ... Hillary likes hashtags. But she doesn’t know what leadership means.'

During a question-and-answer session following her speech, Fiorina predicted that 'if Hillary Clinton had to face me on a debate stage, at the very least she would have a hitch in her swing.'

The crowd went wild.

Fiorina is trying to win a role in an unprecedented women-only matchup for the U.S. presidency. Clinton, the first lady-turnedsenator-turned-diplomat, is the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee-in-waiting.

No woman has ever won the presidential nomination of a major American political party. But 'women are now 53 percent of voters,' she said Thursday, 'and so as I like to tell some of my Democratic friends who continue to talk about a "war on women," we are not a special interest group – we are the majority of the nation.'

Fiorina is the only female Republican creating any buzz as a potential presidential contender, a situation that seemingly requires daily reminders to voters that it might take a woman to beat a woman.

'Like Mrs. Clinton, I too have traveled the globe,' she said Thursday, referring to the former secretary of state's nearly unparalleled air mileage.

But 'unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know that flying is an activity, not an accomplishment.' 

'I have met Vladimir Putin,' she said, 'and I know that his ambition will not be deterred by a gimmicky red reset button.'

That was an uppercut aimed at Clinton's first outreach to Moscow after she won Senate confirmation in 2009. Her office meant to send her to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov with a prop button labeled 'reset' – signifying a new start to U.S-Russia relations.

But they reportedly took the Russian word from an electrical outlet 'reset' switch, not knowing that in Russia the fixtures read 'overloaded' or 'overcharged' when an electrical surge trips a circuit-breaker.

On Wednesday night Fiorina told Daily Mail Online that Clinton's latest speech in Californai indicated that she had run out of fresh thoughts and started stealing a few.

'Hillary needs some original ideas,' she said during a reception for young activists.

Exhibit A: Clinton's June 2014 memoir, 'Hard Choices,' hit bookstores with a cover that looked like a near-copy of Fiorina's 'Tough Choices' bestseller from 2007.

Then on Tuesday Clinton told women at a conference in Silicon Valley – Fiorina's old domain as a former tech CEO – that they should be empowered to 'unlock their full potential.'

That line has been a mainstay of nearly every Fiorina stump speech as she road-tests messages in advance of a possible presidential campaign.

HI, HILLARY! Fiorina has taken to trolling Clinton, saying the former secretary of state is so short on original ideas that she's begun to steal them

Before she launched the 'Carly for America' political action committee this week, FIorina's main fundraising vehicle was actually called the 'Unlocking Potential PAC.'

'We must unlock the full potential of every American and unleash the power of this great nation,' that organization's mission statement reads in part.

Seizing on the apparently pilfered bit of rhetoric, FIorina communications director Sarah Isgur Flores quipped on Twitter: 'Guess all those foreign donations couldnt buy her an original speechwriter?' 

On Wednesday night FIorina was at the CPAC event, an annual half-week of catnip for tea partiers, to rally a group of young conservative activists who had sat through an afternoon 'boot camp' covering topics from candidate development to getting on television.

The Texas native who now lives in Virginia is seriously contemplating a run for the presidency, and would be the most viable female candidate on the Republican side if she were to take the plunge.

Her limited political experience consists of losing a 2010 California U.S. Senate race to Barbara Boxer, an incumbent Democrat, by 10 percentage points.

But now she's playing up her private sector experience, painting herself as an (almost) everywoman focused on shaking up Washington.

'BOOT CAMP': Fiorina spoke to twentysomething-aged right-wing activists after an afternoon of training classes at the site of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, which kicks off Thursday

POLITI-ZINGER: Fiorina's press secretary couldn't contain her snark on Twitter after people watching Clinton's speech noticed the cribbed turn of phrase

'Ours was intended to be a citizen government,'she told a cheering reception of mostly college-age activists on Wednesday night. 'And what a citizen government means to me is that citizens should run for office.'

'You have lots of potential presidential candidates who are going to speak to you,' she said, previewing the three-day conference where nearly all the Republican 2016 hopefuls will appear.

As deafening cheers – largely female – erupted in the hotel reception room, she quickly added, 'Me too!' 

Democrats are largely rallying behind Clinton – a former first lady, diplomat and U.S senator – in the hope of shattering a new glass celing just eight years after putting an African-American in the White House for the first time.

Daily Mail Online asked Fiorina if she could take Clinton's female novelty off the table.

'Well,' she exclaimed with a laugh that approached a cackle as twentysomething fans crowded around her for selfies, 'it would sure make it harder for her!'
