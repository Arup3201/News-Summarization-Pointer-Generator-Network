When Larry Eugene Clinton first asked that his ashes be stored in a jar of his beloved Duke's mayonnaise, family members thought he was spreading it on thick.

But more than 15 years later, the North Carolina man's daughter has helped fulfill his enduring wish.

She contacted Duke's parent company, C.F. Sauer, which sent two glass jars and 10 custom made labels with the 67-year-old's full name.

'What can you say? That’s Duke’s mayonnaise for you. They’ll do what they can to make you happy,' an overjoyed and very healthy Clinton told Gaston Gazette.

Clinton grew up eating the cult 
spread and loved it so much, he told his wife Sue during a funeral 
service several years ago he wanted his cremated remains to be stored in
 a mayo jar.

'We laughed about it and thought it was kind of a joke,' Sue Clinton told WBTV.

But
 Clinton's family quickly worked out he wasn't kidding and spent several
 years scouring thrift stores for traditional glass jars.

Duke's began 
selling its mayo in plastic containers in 1995.

Two weeks ago, Clinton's daughter Teresa Clinton-Edge sent a letter to C.F. Sauer Co detailing her father's wish.

She was shocked to receive a reply from Mark Sauer, Executive Vice President of the company, along with the goods. 

'We are so incredibly grateful,' Clinton-Edge told ABC News. 'My dad is truly loving it, but we hope not to have to use the jars anytime soon.'

She said her father is fanatical about the creamy spread, putting it on everything he eats.

'My father eats Duke’s Mayonnaise on everything: peaches, pears, baloney sandwiches, banana sandwiches,' Clinton-Edge said.

'He says he cannot remember a time that Duke’s wasn’t a part of his family and the food. I’m 43 and that’s the only mayo we’ve ever eaten.'

Since news of Clinton’s bizarre request 
went public, Sauer has received several requests for jars to be used as urns.

'I
 know it sounds - well I don’t know how it sounds - but you almost have 
to do this. It’s somebody’s last wish so it takes a couple of days and a
 few bucks from us,' Sauer told ABC News.

'It’s
 so generational, people have grown up with it. It is a cult product, and around here there 
are lots of regional products that have big followings.'

Sauer explained the company is 126 years old and has been producing Duke’s mayonnaise for about 97 years.
