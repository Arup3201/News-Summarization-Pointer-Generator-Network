A former Florida mayor is accused of major tax evasion and newly unsealed documents revealed Monday that the politician, whose wife is facing charges along with him, allegedly used illicit funds to keep a mistress.

Julio Robaina was once top dog at the city of Hialeah, Florida's sixth largest, but now faces possible jail time in part for allegedly loaning his convicted Ponzi schemer friend $850,000 and then taking over $300,000 in secret cash interest payments with no cut for Uncle Sam.

And no cut for his wife Raiza Villacis-Robaina, it appears, though she's remained by her husband's side nonetheless.

She stayed with him: The ex-mayor of one of Florida's biggest cities, Hialeah in Miami-Dade County, is on trial with his wife for alleged tax evasion. But Julio Robaina, left, may have been hiding money from his wife Raize Villacis Robaina (right) in order to pay to keep a mistress

It's just part of what prosecutors say was over $1 million in 'shadow banking' profits delivered to Robaina. And while the state attorneys have urged Villacis-Robaina-- who they don't believe was a direct recipient of the untaxed cash--to get her own attorney, she has refused.

Which comes as a surprise after the Miami Herald revealed Monday that Robaina was spending the money on a mistress and needed to keep it below board so his wife wouldn't find out.

'The government expects its evidence to show that the cash interest payments were delivered to defendant Julio Robaina, rather than defendant Raiza Robaina,' read the newly unsealed documents.

This fresh twist in the Robaina's saga revolves around their alleged involvement with Luis Felipe Perez, who's now serving 10 years after pleading guilty to running a $45 million jewelry investment Ponzi scheme.

According to the Herald, prosecutors say Perez agreed to pay the couple 18 percent interest on over $850,000.

But they say the arrangement was with he former mayor and not his wife, because the $300,000 or so he made from Perez helped him keep an unnamed mistress on the side.

Meanwhile, it's Mrs. Villacis-Robaina who'll be standing alonside her husband at the April 10 trial.

'We feel an obligation to notify the court and defense counsel of this difference between the two defendants,' the prosecutor said in a closed-door hearing in February.

Despite urgings from the prosecutors over her conflict of interest, Villacis-Robaina continues to retain the same attorney as her husband in the case.

Meanwhile, the alleged dealings with Perez aren't the only misdeeds the couple is accused of.

The May 2013 indictment alleges that Robaina and his wife avoided paying their full share of taxes and instead used the money to purchase two Miami beach condominiums and a Ferrari sports car.

The Newark, New Jersey-born Robaina, a Republican, was first elected mayor of Hialeah in 2005 and elected to a second term in 2009. He stepped down in 2011 to launch a losing bid for mayor of Miami-Dade County, a year after the IRS had begun investigating his personal finances.

Hialeah, a blue-collar and predominantly Cuban-American district, is better known for its ubiquitous warehouses than for its once regal Hialeah Park race track.

One of Florida's biggest cities, it has a long history of graft and corruption and former Mayor Henry Milander, who died in office in 1974 after 27 years in power, survived numerous scandals, including a grand larceny conviction.

More recently, in the 1980s and '90s, Cuban-born Raul Martinez, a longtime Hialeah mayor, won re-election despite a federal influence-peddling indictment and two hung juries.
