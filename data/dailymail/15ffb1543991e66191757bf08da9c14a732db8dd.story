Eddy Sukkar, 21, allegedly picked up a kitten from a drain in Cartwright, south-west of Sydney, on January 27 and kicked it until it was dead

A man who allegedly kicked to death a kitten so violently its intestines burst through its skin has avoided a conviction because a court could not determine whether the cat was already dead.

Eddy Sukkar, 21, was seen laughing as he violently kicked the black and white weeks old kitten 'like a football' in a suburban backyard in the south-western Sydney suburb of Cartwright on January 27 this year.

Neighbour Zandra Stanford, 67, saw told MailOnline she'd seen Sukkar kick the kitten 'which was meowing' eight to 10 times with both his feet, lift the animal by its tail and throw it into a car park.

Police found the animal with its intestines spilled out onto its abdomen and charged Sukkar with torturing, beating and causing the death of an animal.

But confusion over whether there were ants on the animal soon after the assault, if the kitten had really made a noise and an absence of blood at the crime scene led Magistrate Garry Still to dismiss the case in Liverpool Local Court because he couldn't decide whether the animal was alive or dead when Sukkar began kicking it.

A lawyer for Sukkar, whose Facebook photos include one of a kitten being held up with a finger gun, argued the kitten was already dead because Ms Stanford admitted she had seen ants on the corpse.

But she told Mailonline that it was hours after the horrifying incident that police had photographed the dead kitten which by then was crawling with insects.

A mother cat and three kittens were living in this drain just 50 metres from Ms Stanford's unit

Ms Stanford said she witnessed the beating only because she had gone out on to balcony 'for a breath of fresh air' at 7.30pm on a warm summer's night.

'It was daylight saving so it was still light and I had my cataracts done last year so I could easily see,' she said.

At the time around 15 to 20 stray cats were living in the grounds of three public housing units along Hoxton Park Road at Cartwright. A mother cat and three kittens were living in a drain 50 metres from Ms Stanford's unit.

'I saw this young man, skinny, wearing shorts and a singlet bend down and pick something up,’ she said.

'I didn't know it was a kitten at first but he dropped it on the ground and I saw it move a couple of steps.

'It was black and white and then I realised it was a kitten. Then he began kicking it over and over really hard with both shoes. He was kicking it towards the back of the units.

'After eight or 10 kicks, the kitten had stopped moving.'

Ms Stanford said she was both angry and upset and decided 'to go over and tell him off'.

'I walked over to him and he was still laughing. He thought it was a joke.

'I said "what do you think you are doing, how dare you. I'm going to tell your father" and he said the cat was already dead.

'I told him to piss off.'

The area is known for its high number of stray cats

Ms Stanford called the police, who photographed the scene and the cat, by then covered in ants.

'There were lots of strays around then and we feed them and you get attached to them, so it was very upsetting,' she said.

'I can't stand cruelty to any animal.'

But when she gave evidence at Liverpool court on Thursday, Ms Stanford said her account 'wasn't believed'.

She said Sukkar's lawyer had tried to claim trees obscured her view of his client kicking the kitten, disputed the time when ants appeared on the dead cat and claimed she hadn't heard the animal meowing.

'It was a still night and peak hour was over so there was no traffic noise,' she said.

Neighbour Brett Parker said he also witnessed some of the incident, but police had never interviewed him.

'The kitten was definitely alive when I first seen it,' he said, 'then after he kicked it, you could see its guts hanging out.'

Sukkar, who pleaded not guilty, walked free from court despite the Magistrate saying he couldn't believe someone would even kick a dead cat

Sukkar, who pleaded not guilty, walked free from court despite Magistrate Still saying the accused actions 'were distressing on a number of levels' and he couldn't believe someone would even kick a dead cat.

'This one of the most distressing cases I have ever been involved in and I have seen a lot,' he said.

But he could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the cat was alive during the beating.

Ms Stanford said she thought Sukkar, who had been staying with an uncle at the apartment complex, 'was a few bob short of quid' to have done what he did.
