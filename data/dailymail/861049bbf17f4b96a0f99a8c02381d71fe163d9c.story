Valerie Moore, chief executive of the trust which runs the school refused to comment but an online message said the decision was for 'safety' reasons

When snow began to fall gently around their primary school, pupils were naturally excited.

But their joy quickly melted away when their teachers banned them from going near it – or even looking at it through the window.

The youngsters were kept inside after they were ‘marshalled’ into the building at the start of the day.

And a teacher even closed the blinds to stop a class of eight and nine-year-olds from being ‘distracted’ by watching it through the window.

The school – where a vicar caused uproar before Christmas by telling pupils that Santa Claus doesn’t exist – claimed it had acted because of health and safety concerns as the ground had become icy.

But outraged parents accused staff at Stalham Academy, near Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, of being killjoys after just 1cm of snow fell and said that they had missed an opportunity to teach the enthusiastic children about snow.

Mother-of-six Shelly Betts, 43, whose daughter Bethany, eight, is a pupil at the school, said: ‘When they told me they’d shut the blinds I couldn’t believe it. They’re only little and they only stay children for a short time.

‘They could have turned the snow into a science lesson instead of banning them from seeing it.

‘By the time they came out of school it was all gone. I don’t want it to end up with my children only knowing about snow from Christmas cards.’

Julie Hollins, 30, who has an eight-year-old son at the academy, said: ‘Stopping them from seeing it fall is like a slap in the face for little children.’

Another mother, who asked not to be named but whose nine-year-old daughter was in the classroom when the blinds were shut, said: ‘It only snowed for about 40 minutes but the teacher put the blinds down so they couldn’t see it.

‘It was so dark they had to put the lights on. They were stuck in all day as they weren’t allowed to play in the snow – and there was only about 1cm.

‘These are eight-year-olds. It’s not like they’re doing A-levels. I just thought it’s a bit pathetic. Other local schools were doing snowman-building competitions.’ She added: ‘They said there were health and safety reasons because it was icy but it wasn’t.

‘Then they said there were education reasons because the kids were doing a test but none of them remember taking a test.’

She said there had been another light smattering of snow a few days earlier, during which one child was told off for ‘flicking a bit of snow’, while ‘another was put in isolation for touching it’. The mother added: ‘The school has been in freefall since it became an academy last year.

‘Homework is sporadic, teachers are leaving and no one will talk to parents.

‘When my daughter came home and said what had happened it was the last straw.’

The school was put into special measures following an Ofsted inspection in 2013 and was converted into an academy last May. It is now run by Right For Success Academy Trust, which runs two other schools in Norwich.

Valerie Moore, the trust’s chief executive, was not available to comment yesterday.

A message posted on the school’s Facebook page after the snowfall last Monday said: ‘We acknowledge that snow is an unusual and exciting occurrence for everyone, especially children.

‘The academy’s playgrounds were extremely icy so it was felt that in the interests of safety and in line with our risk assessment under health and safety, that children were brought inside at the start of the day.’

The notice added that the teacher who closed the blinds ‘noted the heavy snowfall was having an impact upon the learning of the children’ and acted to ensure that ‘children focused on the tasks in hand’.
