American Vogue used more black coverstars in 2014 than it ever has before in a single year.

Four stars - Rihanna, Lupita Nyong'o, Joan Smalls and Kanye West - appeared on American Vogue covers last year out of a total of 15 overall, the rest of whom were white.

However, only Rihanna and Lupita were given solo covers; Kanye was joined by his wife Kim Kardashian and Joan Smalls appeared with fellow supermodels Cara Delevingne and Karlie Kloss. 

Record: American Vogue chose more black celebrities to grace its covers in 2014 than it ever had before in one year, including two solo stars, Lupita Nyong'o  in July (left) and Rihanna in March (right)

For American Vogue, it certainly signals a move, albeit a slow one, towards the embrace of more ethnic diversity.

In 2013, Michelle Obama and Beyonce were the only women of color to appear on the publication's cover. In 2012, Serena Williams took the sole spot and in 2011, it was Rihanna.

When Halle Berry covered Vogue's most important volume of the year - the September issue - in 2010, she became the first woman of color to do so since Naomi Campbell in 1989.

Plain to see: According to The Fashion Spot, white models have been chosen as cover stars nearly five times as often as non-white women have made the cut (pictured)

Last year's performance, however, puts American Vogue head-and-shoulders above other high-fashion publications in terms of diversity on its covers.

Last month, The Fashion Spot assessed 44 major print publications across the globe to determine which magazines did and did not feature models from a minority background on their cover at some point in 2014.

White models were found to appear 567 times out of 611 total covers, while people of color made the cut just 119 times, nearly five times less overall.

Status quo: Vogue UK has not featured a solo model of color on its cover in a whopping 12 years. Pictured, Cara Delevingne fronts last year's September issue

Lack of representation: Neither LOVE (left, Fall/winter 2014 issue) nor Harper's Bazaar UK (right, September 2014 issue) chose a single cover model of color last year

Harper’s Bazaar U.S. and UK, Vogue UK, Vogue Netherlands, Vogue Paris, Vogue Ukraine, Vogue Russia, Teen Vogue, Numéro, LOVE and Porter all failed to use a woman of minority on their covers at all in 2014.

Keep in mind that The Fashion Spot's survey only took models into account and not celebrities. Beyonce made Vogue UK's cover in 2013, for example, and Rihanna did so in 2011. 

Vogue UK has not featured a solo model of color on its cover in a whopping 12 years, the last instance being Naomi Campbell's appearance in 2002.

But British black supermodel Jourdan Dunn announced today that she would be breaking that spell, having made Vogue UK's February 2015 cover.

The 24-year-old Londoner shared the cover image of the fashion magazine on Instagram to her 954,000 followers, writing: 'I'm so Happy to finally say I'M ON THE COVER OF BRITISH VOGUE!!!' 

Only time will tell whether Vogue continues to lead the way in including a wider range of ethnicities on its covers in 2015, and whether the rest of the fashion world will follow.
