The queue for a morning coffee is a ritual of most office workers.

However, thanks to a new smart payment app, it could soon be a thing of the past.

The Square app can tell the barista at your local store when you are coming in, thanks to your phone's GPS.

The end of the coffee queue! The new app can automatically tell the store you are nearby so your coffee is waiting.

Users choose what they want via the Square Order app.

Once they are near the store, the order is sent.

When they arrive, the coffee should be waiting, and patmeny is automatically taken from their account.

They can then have your favourite coffee ready and waiting - and the app can even pay the bill using your stored credit card information. 

The firm says the app is perfect for commuters.

'You accidentally slept in and are running late for your 9 a.m. 

'You really don't want to forgo your morning coffee ritual, but standing in line at your favorite shop isn't an option. 

'Good thing you don't have to. 

'With first-of-its-kind arrival prediction technology, Square Order can tell when you're close and alert the coffee shop to set your order in motion. 

The app allows users to order their coffee, then have it sent to the coffee shop when they are nearby.

'When you arrive, it'll be fresh, hot, and ready on the counter.' 

The firm is trialling the system at coffee shops in New York and San Francisco, including Blue Bottle.

It then hopes to roll out to more, and expand the service to other stores. 

Square is the second
act for Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, has said its terminals used
by many retailers will accept Apple Pay from customers.

Apple is already working with Twitter to create a
'Buy Now' button for Twitter users and with Facebook to
offer an Apple Pay 'Buy' button to its users, according to Trip
Chowdhry, a financial analyst at Global Equities Research.
