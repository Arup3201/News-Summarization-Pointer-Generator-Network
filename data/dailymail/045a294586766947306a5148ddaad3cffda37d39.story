It's a picture-perfect suntrap famed for its incredible sunset views and balmy water.

But those wanting a more relaxed day at the seaside might have been best to stay away from Perth's most popular beach. 

More than 70 giant pieces of artwork were today unveiled at the Sculpture by the Sea festival at Cottesloe beach.

Giant rhinos, metallic flowers and a 15-metre goon bag usually used for cask wine helped transform the seaside spot into a stunning sculpture park.

Now in its tenth year, the free event, which came to Perth in 2005, attracts artists from far-flung corners such as Japan, Germany and Argentina.
