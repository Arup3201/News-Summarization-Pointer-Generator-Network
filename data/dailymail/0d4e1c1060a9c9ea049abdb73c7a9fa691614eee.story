You should certainly be feeling shipshape after a stay in this medical facility.

The White Sails Hospital & Spa is shaped like a sailing ship and has been earmarked to be built in the Tunisia Economic City (TEC).

Its designers are so keen to make it as authentically boat-like as possible that even the medical staff working there will be made to wear maritime uniforms. 

Architect and millionaire Vasily Klyukin says his design is 'the most pleasant hospital in the world', and a visit will feel 'more like a cruise' than a nerve-racking medical appointment.

Like a cruise: The designers say a visit will feel 'more like a cruise' than a nerve-racking medical appointment

Vasily, a Russian businessman and co-founder of Sovcombank, a commercial bank, explains: 'I was engaged in design and architecture since moving to Monaco two years ago. I was looking forward for this moment and finally it's happening! My very first building to be constructed!'

Formally presented on 10 September, the Tunisia Economic City will be a modern city built over 55 square miles along the coast in the Enfidha area of the North African country, which has a strategic position in the heart of the Mediterranean.

The project will cost £30 billion, which project developers say is already available thanks to the participation of 50 donors and 30 countries.

No fear: Architect and millionaire Vasily Klyukin (right) says his design is 'the most pleasant hospital in the world', as the quirky concept takes away the fear of going in for treatment

First to come: It will be one of the first buildings to be constructed on the development, and is expected to be realised jointly with international engineering company Thornton Tomasetti

One of the first buildings to be constructed over there will be the White Sails Hospital and Spa, which is expected to be realised jointly with international engineering company Thornton Tomasetti. 

The company Lalei Al Barakah Est. from Saudi Arabia will become an investor of this project.

The architect explains: 'The main idea is to build a clinic, where people will feel the calmness and peacefulness, rather than experience the fear while visiting. 

'The hospital will take care of the good mood and the healthy spirit. Visitors will feel themselves more like the guests during the cruise, rather than patients. Even the medical uniforms will be styled as marine uniforms.'

Space race: Klyukin is set to be one of the first to blast into space after bidding on a Virgin Galactic seat at an AmFar charity auction

Vasily, who is set to be one of the first to blast into space after bidding on a Virgin Galactic seat at an AmFar charity auction, says: 'I will fly into Space next year. My health condition has to be checked every six months. 

'That is why I know this feeling very well: every time I'm approaching the white building of the clinic, I don't feel any joy. 

'But I would like to show you the hospital, where there is no room for fear. And so that my son could ask about this hospital: 'Daddy, when will we visit the ship again?'
