Everyone loves a good prank. That is, everyone but the one being pranked -- or the 'prankee.'

The latest prank video posted by AverageBroTV was no different. 

In the video 'Peeking Into Bathroom Stalls Prank!' a girl uses a creepy-looking, male mannequin head (with a curly wig on it) to scare women in a bathroom stall.

The women in the neighboring stall would unsuspectingly use the bathroom, and the prankster would slide the mannequin head over or under the stall.

Screams: Though no harm was done, almost every prankee in the video would deliver blood-curdling screams at the sight of the mannequin head calming down only after the prankster yelled 'It's a joke!'

Though no harm was done, almost every prankee in the video would deliver blood-curdling screams at the sight of the mannequin head calming down only after the prankster yelled 'It's a joke!'

After being assured that they weren't in any danger, most of the women laughed.

Most of them.

At the end of the video, the prankster slipped the mannequin head into the neighboring stall once more. But this time, the prankee grabs the wig off the mannequin head and throws it across the stall.

When the prankster informs the woman that it's all a joke, the woman angrily yells 'F*ck your joke!'

Wig: One scared woman pulled the wig off of the mannequin head before yelling 'F*ck your joke!'

 

Most women in the prank proved to be good sports, but AverageBroTV also posted a video of the prank being performed in a men's bathroom -- the men weren't so forgiving.

In the men's prank video, the men never laughed, only yelled profanities and threatened the prankster. One man even approached the prankster with a gun, threatening him, asking 'is it funny now?'
