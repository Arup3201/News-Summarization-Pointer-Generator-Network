Supermarket giant Tesco today revealed its profits have plunged by almost a quarter in the past six months.

The UK's biggest retailer says its efforts to turn around its struggling business are working despite the 24.5 per cent pre-tax slump from £1.8billion to £1.39billion.

It shares fell by three per cent - down 11p to £3.47 each - as the markets opened in London this morning.

Troubled half-year: Tesco reported a 24.5 per cent drop in group pre-tax profits to £1.39 billion in the six months to August 24

Tesco has blamed restructuring costs and 
steep profit falls across Europe and Asia, while main rival Sainsbury's 
has gone from strength to strength.

Its like-for-like sales also remained flat but rival Sainsbury's continued to pile on 
the pressure as it reported like-for-like sales, excluding petrol, were up two per cent in its second quarter.

Tesco has been forced to abandon its loss making Fresh & Easy start-up 
in America and is unwinding its attempt to crack China alone by entering
into a new joint venture.

Last year the group issued a shock profit warning and has invested 
£1billion trying to fix its broken home business which lost touch with 
its shoppers and was further blighted, along with all its rivals, by the
horsemeat scandal.

The supermarket giant this morning revealed first half group pre-tax profits of £1.39 billion, down 24.5 per cent  year-on-year with currency effects stripped out after being hit by

But trading profits in its UK business rose 1.5 per cent to £1.13 billion, with like-for-like sales excluding petrol remaining flat in its second quarter after falling 1 per cent in the previous three months.

Chief executive Philip Clarke has been leading a £1 billion overhaul at the group, having reported its first annual profits fall in nearly 20 years.

But questions are being raised over the turnaround plans as Tesco battles to stem a continuing decline in its market share.

Latest industry data from Kantar Worldpanel showed its slice of the UK's grocery spending was down from 30.9 per cent to 30.2 per cent compared to last year.

Mr Clarke said: 'Despite continuing challenges, we have made further progress on 
our strategic priorities.

'Our performance in the UK has strengthened
through the half, particularly in our food business, as we have 
continued our work to Build a Better Tesco,' he added.

The group 
suffered a 71 per cent tumble in European trading profits to £55million in the 
first half to August 24 and admitted the hit was worse than expected 
after conditions worsened in countries such as Ireland, Turkey and 
Poland.

Profits also fell sharply across Asia, down 12.4 per cent to £314 million, excluding China.

Tesco admitted the overseas woes would offset some of the benefit of its UK profits improvement over the full-year.

Mr Clarke said he remained committed to Europe, but stressed the region accounted for less than 15 per cent of group sales.
