Extravagant: Khaled Khawaja and Rasha Said held one of the most expensive weddings in recent history

She first made a name for herself by donating money to the Tory party, just as her controversial billionaire father did in the past.  

But there was nothing conservative about Rasha Said's multimillion-pound wedding at France's Palace of Versailles this weekend.

In scenes that defied David Cameron's austerity policies, the 26-year-old London-based socialite staged one of the most expensive marriage celebrations in recent history.

The lavish affair was attended by senior Conservatives including International Development Minister Alan Duncan, at the palace that was once home to France’s notoriously spendthrift kings.

Miss Said’s wedding to fellow PR worker Khaled Khawaja, 27, featured a two-hour live performance by pop star Robbie Williams and a 15ft-high tiered cake.

AAmong the 700 British guests were the Duchess of York and her daughters, the Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, Princess Michael of Kent, Sir Michael Caine, Tory grandee Nicholas Soames, hotelier Sir Rocco Forte and his family, Samantha Cameron’s mother, Viscountess Astor, and Sotheby’s boss Henry Wyndham.

It was paid for by 72-year-old tycoon Wafic Said, a close friend of Margaret Thatcher and one of the Tories' most prominent financial backers before being linked with a shady arms deal. 

Those who accuse Mr Cameron of being an out-of-touch member of the upper classes will also have raised an eyebrow at the presence of his mother-in-law, Viscountess Annabel Astor.

Her daughter, Samantha Cameron, frequently tries to play down the family’s privileged background, as does Eton-educated Mr Cameron.  

Mr Said’s donations were banned during a sleaze crackdown because he was not deemed to be a British resident, but in 2005 Miss Said was recorded as giving £47,000 to the Conservatives.

Then a teenager, she would not have had enough money for the donation, prompting claims that she had unlawfully acted as a ‘proxy’ to her father.

But the Conservatives said it was a clerical error, and that the money had come from Rosemary Said, Miss Said’s British mother.

An enquiry carried out by the Electoral Commission found there had been no wrongdoing, and Miss Said remains a Conservative supporter.  

On Saturday her family and friends filled Versailles, the palace most commonly associated with the Sun King, Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette.

The monarchs’ high living cost them their heads during the 1789 French Revolution, but this weekend's guests had no thought of anything spoiling their merriment as they tucked into a cordon bleu vintage banquet in a resplendent state room.

Dressed in black tie and ball gowns, they filed through the world famous Hall of Mirrors, where the Treaty of Versailles was signed to officially end World War I in 1919.

On Saturday evening, the revellers were serenaded in the manicured Orangery gardens by Robbie Williams – a singer who is unlikely to provide a private performance for less than £1million.  

‘It was an incredible celebration – one that couldn’t be more luxurious,’ said one of the guests.

‘Many of the guests were so rich they arrived by private jets, but even they were surprised by how lavish the whole thing was.

'The whole thing would have cost many millions. People came from all over the world, but there were plenty of Conservative Party supporters from England.’

Speaking about her big day earlier this year, Miss Said said modestly: ‘We want to keep it very private. It is an occasion just for our family and friends’, but this did not stop well-connected friends posting pictures on social media sites which can be viewed by the general public.

These included pictures of the couple preparing to be married, and a photograph of their huge cake.

As well as hiring out Versailles, Mr Said organised a pre-wedding celebration and dinner at the Paris Opera on Friday night, filling it with fresh flowers and dancing ballerinas in honour of his only daughter.

He had originally wanted the wedding 
to take place in Damascus, where he was born, but the ongoing revolution
 in Syria made this impossible.    

The
 entire extravaganza in France rivalled the celebrations of another of 
Britain’s richest men, steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, whose daughter 
Vanisha married at Versailles seven years ago.

Mr
 Said, who sold a collection of the Duchess of Windsor’s jewels for 
almost £8million in 2010, spared no expense for Cheltenham Ladies’ 
College-educated Miss Said and her new husband, a trainee at Lord Bell’s
 PR conglomerate, Chime Communications.

Despite this, guests were instructed on wedding invitations: ‘Your presence is enough but if you want to buy us a gift we are registered at Harrods.’  

The Said family are based in Monaco for tax reasons, but also divide their time between homes in Paris, Marbella, Saudi Arabia and London’s Eaton Square, as well as a £50million Oxfordshire estate.

Mr Said admits that he played a ‘small’ role in the controversial 1986 Al Yamamah deal which saw Saudi Arabia buy £40billion worth of fighter planes from the UK amid allegations of bribery.

As well as Baroness Thatcher and her son Mark, close personal friends include numerous other senior Conservative politicians and former Labour minister Peter Mandelson.  

Mr Said gave £25million to Oxford University in 1996 to found the Said Business School, and now travels the world in his own Boeing 737, making business 'deals behind the scenes’.

Mr Duncan confirmed he was at the wedding, while Downing Street said they ‘weren’t going to deny’ that Viscountess Astor was there too.
