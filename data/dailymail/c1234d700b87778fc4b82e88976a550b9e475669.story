Mario Balotelli’s £16million transfer from AC Milan to Liverpool has caused plenty of excitement on the red half of Merseyside, and according to industry experts, the Reds have kopped a bargain by paying £14m less than the Italian striker is currently worth.

Analysts at Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory have placed ‘market values’ on top players from around Europe based on a wide range of ‘objective’ factors from age and contract expiry date to position, performance data and international experience.

The comparison between transfer fees paid by clubs to sign new players and their current market value allows us to assess the best and worst recruitments from a financial perspective.

Great value: Experts say Liverpool's purchase of Mario Balotelli for £16m represents excellent value, given that the player's true worth is nearer £30m

Mario Balotelli (Milan to Liverpool)

Paid: £16m Value: £30m (-£14m)

Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid to Chelsea)

Paid: £32m Value: £40m (-£8m)

David Luiz (Chelsea to PSG)

Paid: £50m Value: £24m (+£26m)

They calculate that Balotelli was worth £30m, based on a market rates for what a buyer should have reasonably paid for him this summer. That is £14m LESS than Liverpool paid for him and explains why manager Brendan Rodgers called the deal ‘outstanding value’.

The Balotelli deal represents the best value signing for a Premier League club so far this window from a financial perspective, with Liverpool paying just over half of his transfer value.

Jose Mourinho and Chelsea have pulled off the best sale involving a Premier League club so far during this transfer window, by offloading Brazilian defender David Luiz to Paris SG for £50m - £26m more than his transfer valuation of £24m.

Good business: Chelsea did very well to get £50m for David Luiz, who is actually worth £24m 

Shrewd operator: Jose Mourinho sanctioned the sale of Luiz, which has pocketed Chelsea £26m 

Luis Suarez (Liverpool to Barcelona)

Paid: £75m Value: £85m (-£10m)

Angel di Maria (Real Madrid to Manchester United)

Paid: £60m Value: £25m (+£35m)

Alexis Sanchez (Barcelona to Arsenal)

Paid: £35m Value: £23m (+£12m)

Without the attraction of Champions League this season Manchester United appear willing to overpay to ensure they continue to attract the best players. 

Angel di Maria represents the most over-valued player brought in by a Premier League club. United paid Real Madrid £60m for the versatile Argentinian World Cup star, but is ‘worth’ just £25m - suggesting the club have overpaid by a massive £35m.

However the club’s deal for Luke Shaw was close to his market value. The fee of £27m paid to Southampton to secure his services, was just £2.5m over his valuation of £24.5m.

Over the odds: The research suggests Man United have paid £35m more for Angel di Maria than his value 

Price is right: The research suggests Man United have paid the going rate for Luke Shaw

While Liverpool may have pulled off a coup to bring in Balotelli, it seems the Anfield club sold Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £10m less than his worth. Despite bringing in £75m to the club’s coffers, Suarez’s value was actually £85m.

Uncharacteristically, Arsene Wenger appears to have overspent to secure the services of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona. 

The Chilean winger was brought to the Emirates for £35m, £12m more than his book value - although his winner against Beskitas this week secured Champions League football for the Gunners again this season and will have paid much of that amount back.

Other major transfers involving Premier League clubs have seen players move for amounts close to CIES valuations. Everton snapped up Romelu Lukaku for a club-record £28m, £2m less than his value, while Cesc Fabregas joined Chelsea from Barcelona for £26.6m. He was valued at £28.5m.
