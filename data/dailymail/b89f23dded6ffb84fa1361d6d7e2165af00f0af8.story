Amanda Knox's Italian lawyer has filed an appeal of her slander conviction in Italy, a Knox family spokesman in Seattle yesterday.

In October, an Italian appeals court overturned the young Seattle woman's murder conviction in the 2007 death of her British roommate, Meredith Kercher in Perugia.

But the same court upheld Knox's conviction for slander - for falsely accusing bar owner Diya 'Patrick' Lumumba of involvement in the slaying.

Lumumba was held after Knox said that she vaguely 'remembered Patrick killing Meredith' and she 'covered her ears to cover the screams.'

He was freed after two weeks in prison for lack of evidence.

Knox later said she was 'manipulated' during her lengthy police interrogation.

An appeal of the slander conviction was filed on Monday, Knox family spokesman Dave Marriott confirmed.

He doesn't know when the Italian court might consider it.

Knox returned to the U.S. after her murder conviction was overturned.

The former exchange student had been in custody since 2007.

An Italian judge set Knox's sentence for slander at three years, which was less than the time she spent in prison.

That meant she could leave Italy.

Kercher's half-naked body was found with more than 40 stab wounds and a deep gash to the throat in the apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia.

In its ruling last fall, the Italian appeals court also acquitted Knox's then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, in the murder of Kercher.

A third defendant, Ivory Coast-born drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted in a separate trial of sexually assaulting and stabbing Kercher.

His 16-year prison sentence - reduced on appeal from an initial 30 years - was upheld by Italy's highest court in 2010.

In a lengthy court document explaining the ruling that cleared Knox and Sollecito, presiding appeals court Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellmann wrote that Knox implicated Lumumba after hours of intense police questioning because 'she was convinced that was what the police wanted her to do; to name a guilty person.'

When he was released Lumumba said he would never forgive Knox, although he later publicly said that he had.

In 2007 he was quoted as saying: 'I still don't understand how I finished up in all this.

'Because I'm black? Because I'm the perfect guilty one?'

Since returning to the America, Knox, is living in Seattle where she has largely avoided the public eye.
