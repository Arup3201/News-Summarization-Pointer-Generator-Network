When Duke student Miriam Weeks was outed as porn star Belle Knox earlier this year, it led to hostility against the 18-year-old freshman on campus.

But that revelation has only led to positive things in the porn industry where she was been flooded with more work - including a new gig on a reality show.

Come May, Knox will host web-based reality show 'The Sex Factor', a competition for first-time porn stars playing off the hit talent show.

According to the show's website, eight guys and eight girls will compete to win a $1million prize and 'porn stardom'.

America will vote to decide the winner, even getting to weigh in on 'challenges' and the hopeful's porn names.

Porn industry veterans Tori Black, Lexi Belle, Remy LaCroix and Keiran Lee will act as the presiding judges of the competition.

'This reality show is going to be such a game-changer that Simon Cowell will wish he'd thought of it himself,' a source involved with the production told the New York Post.

Knox, a women's studies major, made headlines earlier this year when one of her classmates outed her secret life as a porn star to the student body.  

Since then, she has defended her decision to enter the adult film world on Piers Morgan Live, The View and other talk shows.

'I couldn't afford $60,000 in tuition, my family has undergone significant financial burden, and I saw a way to graduate from my dream school free of debt, doing something I absolutely love,' Knox wrote in a column for xoJane. 'Because to be clear: My experience in porn has been nothing but supportive exciting, thrilling and empowering.'

In an interview on CNN, Knox explained that she chose porn as a career because it paid well, but wasn't time consuming.

'I set my own schedule,' she told Piers Morgan, adding that she makes $1,200 a scene. 'I don't have to worry about not getting sleep or not doing my work because I'm working three jobs.'

While her parents were initially in the dark about her controversial career, they are now reportedly supportive of their daughter's decision.
