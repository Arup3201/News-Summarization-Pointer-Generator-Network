The father of a 16-year-old boy sentenced to fifteen years in prison after taking part in an armed robbery says his son is a victim of bad legal advice and serves another chance.

Cooper Van Huizen is currently in solitary confinement in a maximum security cell at the Utah State Prison after his sentencing earlier this month.

Despite being a first time offender, he currently find himself in the same unit that houses death-row inmates, gang members, and other high profile offenders.

Cooper Van Huizen of Roy, Utah, is facing up to fifteen years in prison after pleading guilty to taking part in an armed robbery. He parents claims they received bad legal advice

Van Huizen’s parents claim their son’s sentence is far too severe. They hope to appeal it and claim they received bad legal advice which recommended that their son plead guilty.

‘23 hours in a cell - that’s going to destroy him,’ Marc Van Huizen, told KSL about his son’s current predicament.

Van Huizen was arrested last fall and accused of being part of a group that committed an armed robbery on November 4 at a home in Roy, Utah.

Court documents said Cooper and four others - including three 18-year-olds - entered the home and held two people inside at gunpoint in the basement while they demanded money and drugs.

Cooper Van Huizen was sentenced earlier this month to two 1-to-15 year concurrent prison sentences after he pleaded guilty to two reduced charges of second-degree felony robbery

Police said they left with $10, a wallet, a cellphone and a bag of marijuana.

The teen was charged as an adult with two counts of aggravated robbery and one count of aggravated burglary - all first-degree felonies with a maximum penalty of up to life in prison.

The Van Huizen’s lawyer recommended a plea deal, believing it would result in a 180-day jail sentence where their son would be able to attend school during the day.

Instead, the judge sentenced him to two 1-to-15 year concurrent prison sentences after he pleaded guilty to two reduced charges of second-degree felony robbery.

The teen cried: ‘No, please, no, please,’ as bailiffs handcuffed him and led him from the courtroom.

Marc Van Huizen claim's that his family received poor legal advice and they wish to retract his son's guilty plea

A new defense attorney has asked the judge to reconsider the sentence and allow the teen to withdraw his guilty pleas.

'There was insufficient evidence to show that my son had any weapon of any kind,' Van Huizen said.

He says that while others held 'broken' guns, his son was never armed, was never an instigator and was simply there because he ended up hanging out with the wrong group of friends.

'He himself now has complete remorse and regret, forever being a part of that situation and he wishes he could take that day back,' said Marc Van Huizen.
