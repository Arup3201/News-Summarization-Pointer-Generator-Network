If you're finding life in the fast lane too much, try the Decelerator Helmet.

The wacky headgear allows the wearer to experience the real world at a more leisurely pace.

Created by German artist Lorenz Potthast, the video signal of a camera is processed by a small computer in the 
inside of the gadget.

The helmet has a small computer and head-mounted display on the inside and another screen on the outside, pictured

The slowed-down 
images are then displayed in front of the wearer's eye inside the device. They are also flashed on a screen on 
the outside of the helmet.

The bizarre-looking invention has three different modes which can be selected by a remote control. In auto-mode, time is slowed down automatically and re-accelerated 
after an interval.

The press-mode allows the specific 
deceleration of time.

Meanwhile, the wearer has full control
of the speed  in scroll-mode.

The Decelerator Helmet has three different settings, which can be adjusted using a handheld controller
