Frolicking in his new home, England’s only polar bear is a picture of contentment.

But moving the 75-stone animal from a Dutch zoo to this purpose-built enclosure was a tricky proposition – not least for Victor himself.

With his breeding days behind him, the 15-year-old was picked to be the first occupant of an £850,000 facility at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park, near Doncaster, complete with an eight-metre-deep lake and swathes of grassland, designed to resemble the Arctic tundra in the summer.

Roar or yawn? A sleepy looking Victor the polar bear takes his first steps on English soil at Yorkshire Wildlife Park - his new home after moving from Holland 

Victor, who is 15 years old, was transported in a specially-adapted cage for his trip to the park in Doncaster, South Yorkshire

To reach it, however, he had to endure a 12-hour journey locked inside a cramped metal box. After being trained to walk into the cage, he was loaded on to a lorry and then ferried to Hull from the port of Zeebrugge, receiving fish and water through the bars along the way.

His new keepers were relieved that upon his arrival on Thursday they were met by a ‘very confident’ and ‘laid back’ character – rather than a polar bear with a sore head.

After spending the weekend in a holding area to give him time to adjust, Victor was finally let loose in his new home yesterday. He quickly settled in with a refreshing dip in the man-made lake, before a rest in one of the caves dug into a bank at the side of the water.

His enclosure is one of the biggest in the world, and could hold up to ten more animals. Victor is expected to be joined by two others by the end of the year – but for now he has all ten acres to himself.

Cheryl Williams, the wildlife park’s director, said: ‘He is quite greedy and loves meat and fish, with his favourite being mackerel, but he is not very impressed by vegetables. I have been told he likes the occasional peanut butter sandwich but we haven’t tried that yet.

'He weighs about 480kg (1058lbs) so he is pretty chunky, but that is his summer weight. When it comes up to winter he will become a real hungry Horace and eat lots more, when it gets colder he will probably be about 500kg (1102lbs). 

Victor has been retired to the UK because he is no longer needed on a European polar bear breeding programme, as he is the father of most of the continent's bears

Victor travelled with his keeper at the Rhenen Zoo, Holland, who will stay with him for his first few days in Yorkshire to help him get used to his new climate

Victor, who retired from a breeding programme after fathering ten cubs, is the first polar bear to live in England for about a decade. He was born in captivity in Rostock, Germany, before moving to Rhenen in the Netherlands.

His new keepers hope to use their enclosure to re-home bears living in unsuitable homes in Eastern Europe or tropical countries. 

The animal, who is such a prolific breeder that he had to be retired because he is father to most of Europe's polar bears, now lives in a 10-acre enclosure which has the environment of an Arctic summer.

Park director John Minion said: 'We are delighted to welcome Victor to the park and be able to make a contribution to polar bear conservation.

'Victor has made a great contribution to the European breeding programme and his genes are very well represented now so the decision was made to retire him to the park.

Victor was driven to a ferry port in Holland so he could begin his journey to England. He is now the only captive polar bear in the country

Can I get out now? The bear appeared eager to be freed from his cage as he arrived at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park after a length journey by ferry from the Netherlands

Let me out: Victor was eager to get out and explore his new home, which includes 8m deep lakes and a realistic Arctic summer climate

Feeling trapped: After a 12-hour journey locked inside the cramped metal cage, the polar bear was let out to meet his new friends who described him as 'very confident'

A JCB was used to haul the 1,058lb bear to his new 10-acre enclosure, which has been dubbed Project Polar because of its Arctic conditions

'He's actually the most prolific breeder across Europe, so most polar bears in Europe are probably his children.

'So because of that he's now been retired from the breeding programme and we offered him a home as we've just built this specialist enclosure which is the biggest in Europe at the moment.'

'But that doesn't stop Victor from being an ambassador for the Arctic. Polar bears are an iconic species that are increasingly threatened in their native habitat and we need to fight their cause.

The park expect Victor to live for anotjer 15 years at least, but he will not be lonely for long as more bears are expected to join him soon. 

'We will have more bears arriving in the autumn and will announce those as soon as details are finalised,' Mr Minion added. 

Because I'm worth it: Victor had no problem with playing up to the cameras at his unveiling in Yorkshire in Thursday

Drying off: The retired polar bear looks more like a large dog as he shakes the water off his fur

Yum: Fish were on the menu shortly after Victor arrived. Park officials say it only took him 10 minutes to settle into his new home

Hungry: England's only polar bear uses a paw to hold down a chunk of meat as he gnaws at his lunch

Enjoying retirement? Victor wanders around his 8m deep lake where he will spend his retirement. He had to leave his role as Europe's top breeder because too many of the continent's bears are his children

Going for an explore: The polar bear enclosure features landscaped hills, valleys, and large lakes, and will be big enough for any more bears the park takes on

And if Victor is anything to go by, the other polar bears will settle in fine at the large enclosure, dubbed Project Polar, which features landscaped hills, valleys, and lakes with water up to 8m deep.

Within 10 minutes of arriving he was seen in his house, eating food and having a drink 'like he had been here all his life', Mr Minion said. 

He will be kept of out of the public gaze while he acclimatises to British temperatures, but will be able to explore his new home.

Mr Minion explained what Project Polar includes: 'The landscaping of the reserves mirror the Arctic Tundra with grass, herbs, shrubs and heathers. There are rocky areas and caves, which provide shelter for the bears as well as their main house.

'The large lake is 8m deep so Victor will be able to swim and dive. We are sure that Victor will enjoy his new surroundings.'  

Taking a dip: Park officials say Victor has enjoyed taking long swims in the lakes in Project Polar and is often seen in the water 

Hello there: Victor wanders towards photographers taking snaps of him. He will not get to meet the public properly until he has aclimmatised to the park

Home, sweet home: Yorkshire Wildlife Park will be moving in more bears in the autumn but have not released any further details yet

Close enough: A cameraman records Victor as he tucks into some lunch, but stays at a safe distance from the large carnivore

Fluffy but fierce: Despite their cute and cuddly appearance, polar bears are some of the strongest animals on the planet

Last year Yorkshire Wildlife Park offered a home to Yupi, a polar bear trapped in soaring temperatures and a concrete enclosure in a Mexican zoo.

Yupi has been at Morelia Zoo since 1992, after being captured in the wild as a cub. Her current concrete enclosure has virtually no shade, and offers little stimulation, causing campaigners to encourage the zoo to move her to a more appropriate home.

The Doncaster park made an offer to rehouse Yupi, but it is yet to be accepted.

Ms Williams said: 'We would still be delighted to re-home Yupi, who is over twenty years old. It would be wonderful if she could enjoy the rest of her life in the reserve here, so we wait for further news from Morelia.' 

There are two other polar bears in Britain, who both live at Highland Wildlife Park in Scotland. One of them, called Walker, is one of Victor's many sons.
