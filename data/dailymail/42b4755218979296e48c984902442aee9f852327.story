A British surfer has told of his terror as he fought off a 6ft tiger shark in Australia.

Richard Wands, 33, hit the shark with his board, and yelled to alert fellow surfers at Trigg Beach, off Perth, Western Australia. He made it back to the beach, more than 150ft away, and alerted a surf life-saving officer.

Tiger sharks are considered the second most dangerous shark to humans after the great white, and the beach has been closed indefinitely while the Department of Fisheries monitor the situation.

Close encounter: Surfer Richard Wands fought off a 6ft tiger shark in the waters of Western Australia

Helicopters have been circling overhead, with City of Stirling officers patrolling the beaches to prevent people entering the water.

Mr Wands, a keen surfer from Perth, Scotland, emigrated eight months ago to become a driller with a Norwegian oil company and pursue his love of surfing.

He described the Wednesday morning encounter as 'the most frightening thing ever.' The surfer had just completed three to four waves when he spotted the tiger shark but did not know it was one of 13 feeding on the carcass of a dolphin.

The shark circled Mr Wands and went under his board. He saw its head and tail and was 'petrified.'

'It
 was a heart-stopping moment and was the meanest, nastiest, most 
frightening thing ever,' Mr Wands said during interviews with Australian
 television and radio.

The tiger shark was within arm's reach 
of him and at one point seemed to be coming straight for him so Mr Wands
 got off his board and used it to try and defend himself.

'I saw it turn and it came straight for me, in a dead straight line, 
undeviating, and it genuinely felt like a true final approach, as it 
were. It definitely felt super-threatening and it wasn't changing its course

'I
 speared the board into the water to try and deter it. That seemed to 
work but it came back again so I used the board again and it moved away.

'I was totally scared and definitely thought I would be coming out of the water with one appendage fewer.'

Mr Wands continued: 'I genuinely 
think this thing was looking for a limb, if not more than that. If it 
had struck blood my gut feeling is that might have encouraged the other 
sharks to get involved as well, and then there might be a different 
story today.

'Luckily 
enough a wave happened to pitch up at the most convenient moment ever 
and I just belly-flopped onto it and just ran it in on my front. This 
was definitely a threat, I was utterly convinced.'

He admitted the incident has put him off his hobby, and added: 'Next time, I may not be so lucky.'

Mr Wands was brought up in Perth in Scotland with twin brother Christopher and sister Olivia. He took up surfing when he was eight while on regular summer holidays with his family in Caithness and has enjoyed the sport around the world, including Hawaii, Fiji and New Zealand.

He
 worked in the oil industry in Aberdeen but emigrated to Australia eight
 months ago. His father Andrew, from Canisbay, yesterday spoke of his 
relief that his son had escaped unscathed.

His son had contacted him to explain what had happened and assure him he was none the worse for his terrifying encounter.

He said: 'I was a little bit surprised but just relieved he was okay. It must have been a scary experience.'

Photographers have been capturing the feeding frenzy at Trigg Beach, where tiger sharks have been lurking just a few feet away from the shore.
