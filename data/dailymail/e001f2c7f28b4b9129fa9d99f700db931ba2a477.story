FRENCH president Francois Hollande is on the verge of dumping his latest mistress Julie Gayet and has been spending more time with the mother of his children, it has been claimed.

Closer magazine, which broke news of the relationship in January, sparking a global scandal, is running a story with the headline: 'It smells like the end.'

It says Mr Hollande, a 59-year-old father of four who has never been married, is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with Ms Gayet, a 41-year-old actress with whom he has allegedly had a two-year affair.

French President Francois Hollande is reportedly seeing less of actress Julie Gayet - and more of his first partner and the mother of his children, Segolene Royal

Pictures published two months ago showed Mr Hollande wearing a crash helmet as he travelled to and from their central Paris love nest on the back of a moped.

It led to Mr Hollande's live-in-lover, Valerie Trierweiler, 49, losing her job as France's first lady and being kicked out of the Elysee Palace.

Now, according to Closer, Mr Hollande is seeing more of Segolene Royal, the 60-year-old Socialist politician he dated for more than 20 years and with whom he has four children.

The magazine points to how Mr Hollande is now 'all smiles and feels free since the clarification of his relationship with Valerie Trierweiler'.

It notes how Ms Gayet has been promoting her career alone, recently going solo to the French Oscars, where she was nominated for supporting actress award.

But, the magazine adds, 'Since Closer Gate, the President and the actress have exchanged a lot of texts about the return of Segolene Royal into the life of Francois Hollande, and perhaps this is a brake on their relationship?

'Worried about the well-being of Valerie Trierweiler, wounded by their separation, is Francois Hollande looking to be with' Ms Royal?

Last week, Ms Gayet claimed more than Â£40,000 in damages from Closer for allegedly breaching her right to privacy by revealing her affair with Mr Hollande.

The revelations caused an international scandal and left Ms Trierweiler in hospital for more than a week.

But Closer defended its reporting, saying that that the secret tryst threatened Mr Hollande's security, and was being carried out using taxpayers' money.

The secret affair also reduced the position of French first lady to a farce, as Ms Trierweiler was carrying out functions while not being Mr Hollande's main partner.

Closer editor Laurence Pieau said his magazine had published information which had been discussed openly at 'dinner parties' and even 'in television studios'.

'We did our duty as journalists in giving exact information that the public had a right to know', she said.
