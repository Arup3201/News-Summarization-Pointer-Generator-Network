He never uses a safety net, and of course, he’s unable to carry a pole.

But today, ladies and gentlemen: step right up for Osbert Humperdinck Pumpernickle, the collie who never wobbles.

The four-year-old cross - Ozzy for short - has rightly claimed his place as Britain’s most accomplished canine tightrope walker.

The collie who never wobbles: Four-year-old Osbert Humperdinck Pumpernickle - known as Ozzy for short - holds the Guinness world record for the fastest crossing of a tightrope ever achieved by a dog

New trick: Ozzy crossed a 3.5m (11.4ft) rope in 18.22 seconds to secure his place in the record books

See how he balances on hind legs on a 
highwire stretched between two trees! Marvel at his skill in traversing a
rope with no visible means of support!

And
now - applaud as he picks up his coveted Guinness World Record award 
for performing the fastest crossing of a tightrope ever to be achieved 
by a dog (a category, it should be said, in which there was surprisingly
little competition).

For the record, he crossed a 3.5m (11.4ft) rope in 18.22 seconds.

The rare feat is just one of Ozzy’s many remarkable acrobatic acts, which also include swinging on a chain, freerunning along a narrow ledge, or balancing on his owner Nick Johnson’s shoulders as he cycles into town. For the avoidance of doubt, by the way, it’s Nick who does the cycling, not Ozzy - although it is surely only a matter of time before this particular dog masters two-wheel travel.

Ozzy, a chocolate and white border collie and kelpie cross, was born on a farm in Anglesey, North Wales, before moving to Nick’s home in Norwich. He showed an early aptitude for balance and seemed keen to improve on that tired old repertoire of standard doggy tricks, such as shake-a-paw and fetch-a-stick.

Nick, a 51-year-old carpenter, bought a book called Puppies For Dummies before enrolling Ozzy on a six-week training course and taking some tips from celebrated ‘dog whisperer’ Zak George.

His acrobatic antics were captured in a YouTube video that led to international acclaim and TV stardom.

Yesterday Nick declared himself ‘so happy and proud’ at Ozzy’s place in world record history, adding: ‘Ozzy’s parents are working sheepdogs on a farm, so it’s in his blood to want to work closely with me. He’s most happy when he’s working on the tricks that we do - he regards it as a game.

'We only practice when Ozzy is in the mood, after he’s done all his important dog stuff like sniffing around and meeting other dogs.’

They might not rank among mankind's greatest achievements, and most of them certainly won't change the world.

But there has always been a place in public's quest for knowledge of the biggest, the best, the bonkers and the bizarre.

Who could possibly sleep, for example, without knowing what the fastest time is for running the 100 meters in high heels? That will be 14.531 seconds, actually, clocked by leggy blonde Fräulein Julia Plecher in Germany last year.

Guaranteed to clean up: 'Hooverman', aka Mr James Brown of Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, has the world's largest collection of vacuum cleaners. The 33-year-old eccentric boasts a record 322 models

Spare a thought for the little guy: KneeHi, nearly six, from Gainesville, Florida, is the world's smallest donkey

Tiny: Milly, a female Chihuahua from Puerto Rico, who has made it to the Guinness Book of World Records as the worlds smallest dog, measuring just 9.65 cm

Skateboarding goat: Harpie the goat from the USA who has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records for the farthest distance achieved by a goat on a skateboard going 36 meters in 25 seconds

Scary: A dragon robot created by company Zollner Elektronik AG in Germany that has made it to the book as the largest walking robot measuring a massive 15.72 m in length, 12.33 m in width, and 8.20 m in height

And here's a question you thought you might never ask: who's got the planet's biggest vacuum cleaner collection? Answer: 'Hooverman', aka Mr James Brown of Hucknall, Notts. The 33-year-old eccentric boasts a record 322 models.

Yes, yes. But what about the animal kingdom? Among all the giants of endeavour and leviathan creatures listed by Guinness World Records, spare a thought for the little guy. It's the shortest donkey on Earth - KneeHi , nearly six, from Gainesville, Florida.

He's a brown jack who stands just 25.29 inches (64.2 cm) tall, measured to the top of the withers, where the neck joins the back.

How low can you go? Rohan Kokane, 7, from Belgaum in Karnataka, India who has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records for for being the lowest limbo skater, achieving a roller-skating height of just 25 cm over a distance of 10 meters

Impressive: Leilani Franco from the Philippines who has made it into the Guinness Book of World Records for the fastest human backbend walk, traveling in a backbend position a distance of 20 meters (65 ft 7.2 in) in a time of 10.05 seconds

The force is with him: Steve Sansweet from the USA has the largest collection of Star Wars memorabilia, having amassed over 300,000 unique items
