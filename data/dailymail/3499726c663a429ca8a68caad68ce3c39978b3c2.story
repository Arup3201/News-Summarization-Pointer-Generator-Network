Three criminals who were caught with £2million worth of party drug meow meow have been jailed for a total of 12 years.

Kenneth Warwick, 37, Nicholas Bailey, 27, and Allen Valentine, 51, claimed to be couriers with limited knowledge of the wider operation, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Police connected them with two consignments of the drug, stashed in cardboard boxes and in a duffle bag.

Meow meow, a once-legal high banned in April 2010, was blamed by one user Jordan Ryan after stabbing his parents.

All three were involved in a delivery of more than 50 kilos of the drug, worth £1.5m, while Warwick and Valentine were also involved in handling a second consignment of 22.75kg worth up to £680,000.

The batch was discovered by police in a car along with another two boxes of the drug, weighing 26.87kg, worth up to £810,000.

All three defendants have previous convictions, with Valentine jailed for
five years for conspiracy to supply £1.2m worth of fake Viagra.

Warwick was also jailed for six years in 2002 for possession of cocaine 
with intent and seven years in 2007 for conspiracy to supply drugs.

Jailing Warwick for five years and four months, and Valentine and Bailey each for three years and four months, Judge Neil Sanders said: ‘On any view of this it was very substantial quantity.

‘I’m of the view that Mr Valentine and Mr Bailey’s part was a lesser role.

Complex plot: Huge quantities of meow meow was stored in cardboard boxes and transferred between cars

He told Warwick: ‘Your previous convictions are highly material and you committed them while on licence.’

Judge Sanders also ordered the drugs to be forfeited and destroyed. Confiscation proceedings will be held at a later date.

Prosecutor Philip Stott said there were two consignments, one involving all three defendants on October 7, 2011, and another on November 24 concerning Warwick and Valentine.

Of the first delivery, he said: ‘Covert surveillance observed a meet in the Caledonian Road area of Islington.

‘Mr Bailey was in a car driven by Michael Harry, and Mr Warwick was in a van driven by Mr Valentine.’

Boxes of the drug were transferred from the van to the car before they all left the scene, he said.

About 20 minutes later the car, still being driven by Harry, 26, was spotted in Harrow, north-west London.

‘Four cardboard boxes containing packets of white powder were found in the rear seat,’ Mr Stott said.

‘Mr Harry immediately told police it was ‘meow meow’ in the boxes.

‘It contained 50.48kg of white powder, with a wholesale value of £150-£200,000, and a street value of £1m - £1.5m.’

Covert CCTV later observed Valentine arriving at Warwick’s address in Clerkenwell, central London, last November 24.

They exchanged a duffle bag containing 22.75kg of meow meow, with a street value of between £450,000 and £680,000.

Two hours later, Warwick gave the duffle bag to Enver Ibrahim, whose BMW was stopped at junction 17 of the M5 by offers from Somerset and Avon Police.

As well as the duffle bag, they also found two cardboard boxes containing 26.87kg of meow meow, worth up to £680,000, Mr Stott said.

Ibrahim, 42, told police he believed the white powder was ketamine and had been paid £300 to collect it.

Ibrahim, of north London, and Harry, of Bristol, both admitted acting as drug couriers in the conspiracy.

Ibrahim, was jailed for 42 months while Harry was handed three years and four months in separate hearings.

Stephen Vullo, defending Warwick, said he got involved in the scheme to pay off a drug debt.

‘He was told to run errands to pay off or at least put off the balance.

‘He was told he was to go and pick up drugs to then store them at his house.

‘The plan was changed, he doesn’t know why, and the drugs were transferred from one place to another.’

Chris Sutton-Mattocks, for Bailey, who spent three years as a soldier for the Royal Anglian Regiment, said his involvement was limited in time and action to one instance and was offered no cash payment.

Laurie-Anne Power, defending Valentine, a trained mechanical engineer, added: ‘He describes this as a monumental error of judgement.

'He was a courier and had little knowledge of the wider scale of the operation.’

Valentine, of north-west London; Bailey, of Romford, Essex, and Warwick admitted a single count of conspiracy to supply a class B drug, namely methylmethcathinone, also known as meow meow.

An earlier version of this article stated that a user from Durham attempted to rip off his scrotum whilst on the drug.  We are happy to clarify that this is not the case and it was a hoax.
