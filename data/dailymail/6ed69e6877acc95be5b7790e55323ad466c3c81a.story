Ashley McKenzie's judo career began with a playground fight over a stolen Pokemon card and reached its pinnacle when he became Commonwealth champion on Thursday night, leading an English gold rush.

McKenzie embraces his ‘Bad Boy’ nickname. He has been banned from the sport several times for misbehaving, spent time in a young offenders’ institute and now plans to open a school for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the condition he honed to become a champion.

As a child he was diagnosed with asthma, eczema, ADHD and obsessive compulsive disorder. He had two hearing aids fitted and surgery to mend a hole in his heart.

Champion: England's Ashley McKenzie poses with his gold medal after victory in the judo under 60kg final

Little warrior: Ashley McKenzie has overcome problems including ADHD to become a gold medal winner

But he 
showed plenty of heart as he battled back to beat India’s Navjot Chana 
in an edgy 60kg final to claim the first of three English judo golds. In
 a dimly lit recess of Glasgow’s Scottish Exhibition and Conference 
Centre hidden from the sold-out crowd, McKenzie grasped his gold medal 
tightly.

‘I wasn’t 
much good at school. I never had any A-stars or a job,’ he said. ‘This 
is my job now and I wouldn’t swap it for any GCSEs.’

McKenzie 
cried when he exited the Olympics in the second round in 2012. The next 
month, he came fifth on a series of Celebrity Big Brother. But he wants 
to be defined by his sporting success now.

‘I wasn’t 
half bad at judo before Big Brother but people know me for appearing on 
that and for being a bad boy,’ said McKenzie, ‘Now they can know me for 
winning Commonwealth gold.

‘Hopefully
 one day they can know me as Ashley McKenzie, that guy who’s got gold in
 the Olympics. I can be a positive role model. I’ve had problems, I 
understand people who have problems. My family is a bit crazy as well.’

Second time: McKenzie thought he had won his fight with a hip throw before the score was downgraded

The 
25-year-old took up judo at 11 after losing a fight at a school in North
 London when another pupil put him on his back using a judo move. He 
went to his local club to ensure it wouldn’t happen again.

After 
winning gold, he revealed: ‘Hopefully this is a stepping stone towards 
opening a school for kids with problems to help them progress in life. 
I’m not saying they shouldn’t study but there are different ways of 
communicating with kids with ADHD. I want something else to channel my 
energy into and make it a better world.’

McKenzie, 
who is 5ft 3in and weighs less than 9½ stone, is a little warrior. After
 going behind by a 10 point Waza-ari, he went on the counter-attack and 
thought he had won the contest with a hip throw, which was given as 
ippon — the judo equivalent of a knockout. There was a lengthy delay 
before his score was downgraded. ‘I’ve learned to control my emotions so
 I was able to stay focused,’ said McKenzie, who held on to win with a 
shido penalty victory.’

Rough and tumble: McKenzie struggles with Chana on the ground during their gold medal bout

McKenzie’s
 roommate in the athletes’ village is Colin Oates, who also won gold 
after dominating the under-66kg final against underdog Andreas Krassas 
from Cyprus.

Oates 
scored a yuko before finishing the contest halfway through with an 
armlock. ‘We’ve got the golden room now,’ said McKenzie. English judo 
had even more to cheer when Nekoda Davis executed a throw on Scotland’s 
Stephanie Inglis and held her down to win the women’s under-57kg final.

Scotland 
boasted two gold medallists from the same family after Kimberley 
Renicks, 26, won gold in the first final of the evening.

Her elder 
sister Louise, 31, was watching as she prepared for her own match and 
said she was inspired by her sister and went on to win her own gold.

‘We came 
here to win double gold and we did it. We took judo up at the same time 
when I was 11. My dad opened a centre to keep us off the streets. This 
is special.’
