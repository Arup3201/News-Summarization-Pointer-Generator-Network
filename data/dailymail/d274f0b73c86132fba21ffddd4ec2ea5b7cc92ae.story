Thousands of cancer patients will get fast-track access
to new drugs, David Cameron said as he promised an extra £400million for a fund
which has already saved lives.

The Prime Minister and wife Samantha today met a group of
young children battling with the disease on a visit to a hospital in Oxford.

The £200million-a-year Cancer Drug Fund, which pays for
drugs refused by an NHS spending watchdog, will now continue until 2016.

The fund was set up for patients in England after
shocking stories of patients being refused life-saving drugs by the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) because they were too expensive
or unproven.

It meant that wealthy people with cancer were able to
receive the drugs by laying for it themselves but less well-off patients were
barred.

Mr Cameron said the fund, which has already been used by
35,000 patients, was saving lives.

Speaking after meeting cancer patients young and old at
The John Radcliffe Hospital, in Oxford, the PM said: ’People have lived longer
and in some cases it has saved people's lives.

’I just met one man from Hampshire who wouldn't be here
were it not for the Cancer Drugs Fund and the treatments that he got. He is now
cancer free.’

The scheme was set to run until 2014 and campaigners
raised concerns about where patients will turn to when the funding ceased.

But Mr Cameron said that the funding programme will run
for an extra two years to March 2016.

While praised cancer charities, some doctors have raised
concerns about the fund.

The medical journal The Lancet called the fund ’the
product of political opportunism and intellectual incoherence’.

David Cameron and his wife met with patients who said they would not be alive if it weren't for the fund

As many as 35,000 patients could benefit as a result of extra funding announced by the PM

The Rarer Cancers Foundation campaigned for the fund's extension and welcomed the move

Mr Cameron insisted: ’Thousands of people have already
been helped and this will mean many more people can access it in the years to
come.’

Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha were taken around the
children's cancer ward by senior clinical staff where they met youngsters of
all ages being treated for the disease.

Later he met people who were in remission from cancer and
talked with them about their experiences on the NHS.

The Rarer Cancers Foundation, which campaigned for the
fund to be extended, welcomed the announcement of the fund's extension.

Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the charity, said: ’The
Cancer Drugs Fund has made a huge difference to cancer patients in England,
significantly improving the quality of treatment available to people with
advanced forms of cancer.

’It has also addressed some of the historic inequities
that have existed for people with rarer cancers, ensuring that access to
treatment is not denied simply because you are unlucky enough to have a rare
form of cancer.’

Not everyone is pleased with the fund and with one journal calling it 'the product of political opportunism and intellectual incoherence'

So far about 35,000 patients have benefited from the fund
and the charity estimates that 16,500 extra patients will benefit each year as
a result of the extension of the funding programme.

Dr Andrew Protheroe, consultant in medical oncology at
The Churchill Hospital in Oxford, added: ’The more treatment options that are
available to me, the better job I feel I can do for my patients.

’There is nothing more frustrating than knowing there is
an effective, licensed, evidence-based treatment available which I am not
allowed to use.

’It is like trying to do your job with one hand tied
behind your back.

’Before the Cancer Drugs Fund, doctors were not able to
use a whole range of drugs which were part of standard practice in other
countries.’

Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK,
said: ’New treatments targeting the genetic changes in cancer are being
developed all the time, and the Cancer Drugs Fund is a vital way for patients
to get them as soon as they've been properly tested and shown to work.’

Alongside plans to extend the fund, Mr Cameron also
announced that Genomics England - a Government-owned organisation tasked with
mapping the DNA of 100,000 patients with cancer and rare diseases - will begin
a partnership with Cancer Research UK.

But Labour’s shadow health minister Liz Kendall said:
’The reality is that David Cameron is letting down cancer patients.

’A recent report for Cancer Research UK found NHS staff
were worried that the Government's NHS reorganisation was fragmenting cancer
services and stalling the dramatic improvements in cancer treatment seen over
the last decade.’
