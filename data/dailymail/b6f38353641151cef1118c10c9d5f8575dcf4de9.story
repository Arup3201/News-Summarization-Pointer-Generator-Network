A huge fire broke out at a lap-dancing club this morning after a driver reversed a car into the town centre building and set it on fire.

Firefighters were confronted with a 'very fierce fire' were they arrived at the Dream Lounge gentleman's club in Swindon at 7am this morning.

Flames were as high as the roof and were spreading throughout the building.

Bizarre: This car was driven into a strip club called Ladies & Gentlemen's club in Swindon Town Centre

Emergency: Firefighters put out the flames at the strip club this morning

According to the Swindon Advertiser, after driving into the building, the driver of the black
Honda escaped through the sun roof and poured petrol over 
the vehicle.

The driver then left the scene before police officers 
arrived.

Firefighters said they were initially called out to a car fire close to the club, but it soon emerged that the building was on fire as well.

Speaking to the BBC, Mark Fuller, from Wiltshire Fire and Rescue service, said: 'We were 
confronted by a very fierce fire that was spreading into the building 
and up to the first floor with flames as high as the roof.'

Nasty: A firefighter can be seen putting out the blaze. When fire crews arrived, flames were as high as the building

Worrying: It is believed the driver of the black Honda escaped from the car through the sun roof and poured petrol over the vehicle

A fire investigation has now started with police officers saying they will study CCTV images.

Sergeant Mark Simpson said: 'We are conducting a thorough investigation 
with colleagues from Wiltshire Fire and Rescue, including analysis of 
CCTV in the area.

'We know that there were several people in the area shortly before the 
car hit the building and I would like to hear from anyone with 
information.'

The venue is open from 10pm to 4.30am on Friday nights.Â 

Probe: Detectives have said they will study CCTV images to find out what happened
