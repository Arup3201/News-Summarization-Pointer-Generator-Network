It's the sight you never thought you'd see. Tiger Woods dumping a bucket of ice and water on his head all in the name of fun and charity.

Well, Rory McIlroy dumping a bucket of ice and water on his head to be precise.

Fresh from their appearance together on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, golf's two current superstars are among the latest big names to brave the craze sweeping the world's sporting celebrities: the ice bucket challenge.

Double trouble: Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods introduce their ice bucket challenge

Brrrrrr: Woods is the first to get soaked as McIlroy drenches his friend and rival

Revenge: Woods then strikes back, dumping his ice bucket right on McIlroy's head

We have a winner: Unlike on the course recently, Woods won the contest with McIlroy left totally soaked

It is fast becoming an internet phenomenon and the clue is in the name: participants must dump a bucket of ice over their heads before nominating three others to take up the challenge.

It is all in aid of raising awareness of motor neurone disease and anyone not completing the challenge must donate money to the ALS Association, according to the rules of the game.

Once upon a time the prospect of Woods taking part in the challenge would have been unthinkable. Famously a lone wolf, Woods never showed any public signs of being anything other than the steely-eyed, fist-pumping golfing machine that has racked up 14 major titles and shattered records at every turn.

But, if ever there was a sign that times have changed, here it is. Woods and McIlroy, seemingly heir to Tiger's crown as the world's most brilliant golfer following his wins at The Open and the US PGA Championship this summer, were game contestants and laughed heartily at their discomfort.

And, unlike events on the course recently, if there were a winner from this contest it was certainly Woods, who left his friend and rival utterly soaked and shivering, while McIlroy somehow managed to fill up Woods's bucket with even more water during his attempt.

Fellow golfers Justin Rose and Ian Poulter were among the first sports stars to freeze themselves in the name of charity last month, and Poulter laid down the challenge to Woods then. It seems the former world No 1 has finally accepted.

We will wait with interest to see whether McIlroy's nominations accept his challenge. They are Wayne Rooney, actress Meghan Markle and George W Bush. Yes, the George W Bush. There can't be a person in the world not wanting to see that particular ice bucket challenge.
