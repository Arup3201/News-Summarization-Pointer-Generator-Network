Real Madrid centre back Raphael Varane has extended his contract by three years until June 2020, the European champions announced on Thursday.

Varane, 21, joined Real from Lens in 2011 and is the club's third-choice centre back behind Spain's Sergio Ramos and Pepe of Portugal.

It has not yet been confirmed what money the defender will be on, but prior to the extension he was said to be unhappy with his £25,000-per-week wages.

The Frenchman is known for his pace and has improved steadily since joining Real from Lens in 2011

Earlier this summer, the youngster attracted interest from Chelsea after impressing for France at the World Cup, where he helped Les Bleus reach the  quarter-final in Brazil.

Blues boss Jose Mourinho signed Varane as Real Madrid manager from Lens  three years ago.

In total Varane has made 13 appearances for France, and will look to establish himself as a more regular starter in the Real Madrid side.
