He was a skinny bear with only one arm, who could do little more than scavenge for food in order to survive.

But the disabled black bear made the crucial mistake of rummaging through bins at the upscale housing community in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.

He was a common sight as he ambled along golf courses and the neighbourhood, but finally some residents had enough - particularly when he stole two pies from a kitchen counter - and he was shot dead by the area's Wildlife Management.

Now his death in Mountain Air, about 35 miles north of Asheville, has become a flashpoint for the community - with wildlife advocates and some residents outraged at the way the disabled bear was destroyed.

Killed: This three-legged bear was killed by management at the Mountain Air development in North Carolina

Residents
in the Mountain Air community first saw the injured bear in November 
2011. At the time, its right front leg was still attached but appeared 
to be hanging by a flap of skin. It is unclear how the leg was injured.

When
the bear reappeared in the spring, its leg was missing. Construction 
workers building a house on the development began feeding the bear 
because he was so skinny, said Beverly Hammond, who lives in the 
community.

For some, 
Mountain Air is their second home. So when they returned to the 
development for spring and summer, they began complaining about the bear
breaking into homes.

After the bear started breaking into 
homes looking for food,
some people had enough.

Wildlife advocates scrambled to find a sanctuary
for the animal, but time ran out: in August, the bear was shot and 
killed by management.

Those who were left distraught by what they say was an inhumane response say officials need to find non-lethal ways to handle 
so-called nuisance bears.

'When
it comes to nuisance bears, the state's policy is simple: shoot them,' 
Millie Bowling said. 'And that's just wrong. That needs to change.'

Pest: Some residents of the wealthy Mountain Air community complained about the bear's presence

North Carolina has seen a major 
resurgence in black bears. A generation ago, their numbers had dwindled 
because of hunting and development, and the animals were only found in 
the most remote mountains and coastal swamps.

Now there are about 15,000 black 
bears in North Carolina, with about 5,000 in the western North Carolina.

Bear complaints began to increase in the 1990s, primarily in 
residential areas of western North Carolina where developers began 
building multimillion-dollar homes in gated communities.

The number of bear complaints has doubled in the last decade - from 277 in 2001 to 671 in 2011, according to the agency.

Many
involve bears who have become too comfortable around humans. They 
wander into backyards, looking for food.

Most of the blame can be placed
on humans, said Bill Lea, a nature photographer and naturalist who 
tried to find a sanctuary for the three-legged bear.

If
people do not lock up garbage cans, bears will sift through the trash. 
If people leave food in bird feeders, bears will find it.

'Bears
that have learned to get food from people - either direct feeding, or 
the garbage and bird feeders... and they subsequently lose their fear of
people,' Lea said.

Management sent emails and posted notices advising people to keep their windows and doors closed on the ground level.

Some residents ignored the warnings, 
Hammond said. By early summer, Hammond and other activists were racing 
to find a sanctuary to take the bear. She said she begged for another 
day or two, but the community's management refused, and the commission 
also offered no help.

'Everyone in our development wanted 
the bear to be removed, but most wanted him to be removed alive and 
taken to Grandfather Mountain, and not removed from our development dead
in the back of a pickup truck,' she said. 'It was just devastating.'

This is the latest controversy 
surrounding the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. Wildlife 
advocates were upset last year when state biologists killed nine penned 
deer on a homeowner's property in Randolph County.

The commission said the deer were 
killed because they had to be tested for a fatal disease called chronic 
wasting, which cannot be done on live animals. But the owner, Wayne 
Kindley, and supporters said they were outraged.

Wildlife
and environmental groups are also angry that the commission allowed 
overnight hunting of coyotes throughout North Carolina this year, 
including in the area inhabited by the only wild population of red 
wolves, one of the world's most endangered animals. The groups opposed 
the rule because red wolves resemble coyotes and are hard to tell apart 
even during the day.

David
Cobb, chief of the agency's Division of Wildlife Management, said the 
Mountain Air community decided to kill the three-legged bear. 'This was 
an animal that had caused damage to property multiple times, and the 
property owners decided they were going to address that issue. And they 
did,' he said.

Complaint: Management at the community said they had no other way to deal with the bear

But wildlife advocates say the state 
did not do enough to help them relocate the bear. 'The idea of shooting 
bears should be an absolute last resort,' said Leslie Hayhurst, who 
lives on Beach Mountain and runs the Genesis Animal Sanctuary.

Some states - mostly in the West - 
capture and relocate nuisance bears to remote wildlife settings. The 
Wyoming Game and Fish Department routinely relocates and removes black 
and grizzly bears as part of normal department operations. But in many 
states, there is no place remote enough to relocate them. And the bears 
seldom stay where they are released and may return to where they were 
caught.

In North 
Carolina, the agency can relocate a bear but it is done on a 
case-by-case basis, and it usually only involves orphan cubs, Cobb said.

'There
are very few places you can put a bear that won't be in somebody's 
backyard,' said Bradley Howard, the agency's private lands program 
coordinator.
