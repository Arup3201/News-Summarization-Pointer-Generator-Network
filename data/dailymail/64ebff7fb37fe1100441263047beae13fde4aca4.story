Richard Campagna, 36, was chased through Legoland water park when he was drunk

Police used a Taser on a drunk man who led them on a 30-minute chase around a Legoland water park before telling them his name was Pterodactyl when he was eventually arrested. 

Richard Campagna was chased through the Florida amusement attraction on Wednesday.

Police were called after the 36-year-old, who had arrived at the park alone and appeared to be drunk, refused to leave Legoland.

Ignoring staff's instructions he instead ran into the park's lazy river which was 'occupied by a large number of children,' the Sheriff's Office said.

During the course of the subsequent chase he splashed water on an officer.

Police decided to try and stop Campagna using a stun gun, but their attempt was unsuccessful because only one of the probes stuck into Campagna.

He pulled it off and continued to run, but was eventually arrested by several officers, reports The Ledger. 

When detectives asked him his name, he told them, 'Pterodactyl,' according to The Ledger 

Campagna was booked into the Polk County Jail in lieu of $1,750 bail.

He now faces charges of battery on a law enforcement officer, splashing water on a deputy, disorderly conduct and resisting officers without violence.

No-one in the park was injured and Campagna did not need medical attention after being corralled.
