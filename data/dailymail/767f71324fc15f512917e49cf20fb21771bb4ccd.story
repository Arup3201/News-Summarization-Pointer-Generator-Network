Getting enough sleep will be one of the biggest challenges facing the first astronauts travelling the 47million miles to Mars.

Poor sleep was a key problem encountered by six volunteers during a 17-month simulated round trip to the Red Planet.

The men - three Russians, an Italian, a Frenchman and a Chinese man - spent 520 days and nights confined to a 550 cubic metre 'spacecraft' and cut off from the outside world.

Scientists operating the Mars500 project in Russia monitored their medical and psychological condition as well as activity levels and sleep patterns.

The men were kept isolated and did not have access to natural light or fresh air.

For one month of the project, funded by Russian and European space agencies, they were able to explore another enclosed area that represented the surface of Mars.

As the mission progressed, crew members became more sedentary and most experienced sleep disturbances, the data revealed.

Without normal sleep-wake activity cycles, their 'body clock', or circadian rhythm, patterns became disrupted.

The mock spaceship made most of the volunteers lethargic and sleepy.

Four of the men had considerable trouble sleeping and some had depression issues.

Only
one man's sleep was mostly unaffected during the 'trip', according to 
the findings published in the journal Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences.

Previous simulated missions have even included simulated 'Mars walks' supposed to replicate excursions onto the surface of Mars.

One of the six volunteers - who were 
paid about £62,000 - slept nearly half an hour less each night than he 
did when he started the mission, affecting how he went about his day.

Co-author Professor David Dinges, from
the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, said: 'A 
take-away message from this line of research is the life-sustaining 
importance that healthy sleep duration and timing plays for everyone.

'As a global society, we need to 
re-evaluate how we view sleep as it relates to our overall health and 
ability to lead productive lives.

Nasa landed the Curiosity rover on Mars last year which has sent back information to give scientists a better picture of the planet

'Whether it is an astronaut being 
challenged to reach another planet or a newborn baby just learning to 
walk, the human body's need for sleep is as essential as our need for 
food and water and integral to our ability to thrive.'

The scientists found that to make any long space mission a success they would need to mimic night and day cycles on Earth.

This will mean paying attention 
to timed light exposure, food intake and exercise.

Sleep expert Dr Mathias Basner, from the
University of Pennsylvania in the US and a member of the research team, 
said the study revealed the 'need to ensure maintenance of the Earth's 
natural circadian rhythm, sleep quantity and quality, and optimal 
activity levels during exploration missions'.

Last year Barack Obama announced Nasa would aim to reach an asteroid by 2020 and after that send astronauts to Mars.

The world record for continuous time in space - 14 months - is held by Dr. Valery Polyakov, who was on the Russian space station Mir in 1994 and 1995.

American astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko are scheduled to spend a year in space on the International Space Station, starting in 2015.
