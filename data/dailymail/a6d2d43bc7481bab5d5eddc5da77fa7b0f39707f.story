Two toddlers have created spoof scenes from the nine of this year's Oscar nominated films - including The Wolf of Wall Street.

Sophia, three, and Sadie, two, spent weeks with the help of their mother Maggie Storino replicating the famous moments from 2013's biggest movies.

But little Sophia looked more like the wolf cub than Wolf of Wall Street as she brandished a pretend $100 bill with slicked back hair for the Leonardo Di Caprio film about a wealthy stockbroker.

While another shows the tot wearing her father's watch and mum's curlers to mimick Bradley Cooper's FBI agent in American Hustle.

Mother Maggie, from Chicago, said: 'There is a lot of time and thought that goes into the preparation of the photos.

'We set them up when the girls are asleep and then put Sophia in the middle of the picture when she wakes up in the morning.

'With toddlers, if you don't get the photo on the first take it won't work - they eat the props, they play with the dolls, they run amok in a spacesuit.'

The photo project began as a light-hearted attempt to make Maggie's sister - a journalist working covering the Oscar's - laugh.

But after posting them online, Maggie says she was taken aback by the positive reaction the fun images received.

She added: 'My sister is a journalist, working on Oscar coverage and we took the photos to make her laugh. And it worked.

'Our friends and family liked the photos so much they suggested we post it online.

'I was nervous about putting my kids on the internet. We are absolutely shocked to see how many people really seem to enjoy the photos.'

The trio now plan to keep adding to their collection - as long as the girls are happy to play along.

Maggie said: 'American Hustle and Wolf of Wall Street were the most fun to do. Sophia loved dressing up for those pictures. Plus she got to wear her dad's watch.

'We try to pick a scene from each nominee that is suitable for kids. We avoid photos with guns or violence. Also, we try not to buy anything for the photos so we choose the photos based on what props we can find at home.

'Surprisingly, we haven't seen many Oscar films this year. It can be tricky to get a babysitter - but we've all enjoyed the chance to spend time together as a family.

'We will keep working on the photos as long as it is a positive experience for my daughters. We're thrilled that people are enjoying the photos. We had so much fun putting them together.'
