A skeleton key, one that can open any lock, is normally something confined to the realms of films and television.

But two engineers claim to have devised a 3D printed ‘bump key’ that, with a bit of brute force, can do exactly that.

Their device can apparently be used to open any conventional lock without having access to the real key used to open it.

German engineers have revealed designs to make 3D-printed 'bump keys' (shown). These devices can be used to break into popular pin tumbler design locks. In a video a lock is opened by a bump key and a hammer in seconds. To make the key all that is needed is a picture of the lock and pin positions

Later this month at an event known as LockCon 2014 German engineer Christian Holler will present his and Jos Weyers' bump key design.

Lock bumping is a lock picking technique that can be used to open pin tumbler locks (shown above), the sort found in many homes.

These locks require a key with specific groves at different levels to align a set of pins along what is called the shear line, allowing the lock to be turned.

Each pin has an upper and lower segment, as shown in the image.

A bump key, meanwhile, has groves that are all at the same level.

When the key is placed in a lock, it needs to be struck sharply with a hammer while torque is applied.

The force of the blow makes the top of the pins ‘jump’ above the shear line but leaves the bottom pins in place, allowing the lock to be turned.

A stopper is also used to prevent damage being done to the lock. 

Traditionally bump keys were made out of metal, and were quite hard to manufacture. Now, with the 3D-printing method, anyone could feasibly create their own bump key.

Using DIY software known as Photobump, the technique requires only a picture of the lock in question to produce a working key.

‘While there are locks on the market, that are immune to bumping, a large quantity of locks in use is theoretically vulnerable,’ Holler explains in a blog post.

A bump key, as its name might imply, involves ‘bumping’ a key into position in a lock.

They have multiple grooves cut to the same length that can fit into conventional locks.

They are normally made from blank keys, which are flattened keys with no cuts, used by locksmiths and manufacturers to make key duplicates.

The technique for making bump keys isn’t particularly new; it’s been around for decades, with a hammer used to hit the key and click it into a lock’s pins.

With 3D printing, however, such keys can now be made relatively easily.

To create the key, Holler and Weyers use a picture of the lock in question.

They also need to know the position of each pin in a target lock, which is accessible from widely available key-cutting software.

Mr Holler says it can be used to open locks that are vulnerable to bumping, but such keys have been on the market for more than ten years.

The 3D printing technique, however, makes the creation of both blank and bump keys much easier.

‘If you have the right software, getting a blank is easy,’ Holler tells MailOnline.

Designer Christian Holler tells MailOnline that he does not think his work will be used by burglars to break into houses. 'One of the main reasons is probably that there are easier, destructive entry methods, and a burglar is not interested in non-destructive opening,’ he says

‘Basically, I take a photo [from the front], then I manually edit it in Photoshop or Gimp (it's really easy) to give me a black/white silhouette of the profile,' Mr Holler continues.

‘Once I have that, I import it into my software, specify the key length (that would also be guessed from the brand) and from that, I already get a 3D model that I can order from any online 3D printing service.’ 

But, he says, making a bump key is a bit more difficult.

It requires knowledge of the pin distances and maximum height, which can be guessed from other keys or taken from a database.

To print them he doesn’t use his own printer, but rather a professional printing service which can take a few days, or up to two weeks.

The bump key is made from a 3D model of a blank (shown) and has groves that are all at the same level. When the key is placed in a lock, it needs to be struck sharply with a hammer while torque is applied. The force of the blow moves the pins and allows the lock to be turned and opened

On whether a burglar could use this technique to break into a house Mr Holler says: ‘If he has enough criminal energy, then I guess, yes.’ 

However he adds that he does not think this is a ‘realistic scenario’; he says that bump keys are already available, but they are not widely used by burglars.

‘One of the main reasons is probably that there are easier, destructive entry methods, and a burglar is not interested in non-destructive opening,’ he explains.

‘At least here in Germany, only something below 0.2 per cent of all burglar attacks target the lock cylinder.’

But his advice is that if you are worried about bump keys, there are locks are available that are immune to bumping.

'All regular pin tumbler looks are vulnerable,' he says, but other systems are typically immune. 

Using a pin tumbler design with a so-called 'sidebar', however, requires a second combination on the key that is much harder to mimic.

But despite revealing his technique to create bump keys, Mr Holles doesn't consider bumping 'a larger threat now' with his work. 

'The practical relevance of bumping (for burglars) seems to be overall low, so there is no reason to panic about this,' he says. 

'People also haven't panicked the last 10 years, although bumping was a well known technique.'
