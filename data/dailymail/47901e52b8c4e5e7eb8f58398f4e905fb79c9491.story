Alex McCarthy is hoping his second game in goal for Queens Park Rangers turns out to be less traumatic than his first.

The 25-year-old, who chose Rangers over Liverpool when Reading accepted bids from both two months ago, is hoping to keep his place at home to Aston Villa tonight.

His bow came last week and just happened to be against Liverpool, whose 3-2 victory saw two Rangers defenders — Richard Dunne and then, just seconds from the final whistle, Steven Caulker — put own goals past him.

‘It’s a debut I won’t be able to forget,’ he said. ‘I’m hoping this game will be more straightforward, a nice 1-0 and a clean sheet will do.’

Those come rarely for struggling Rangers, whose manager Harry Redknapp spent most of last week engaged in a war of words with Adel Taarabt, the midfielder he had insisted was too fat to be picked.

‘The whole team have been focused and it hasn’t affected anyone at all,’ insisted McCarthy.

McCarthy was unfortunate to concede three times on his debut, with Richard Dunne also scoring an own goal

That hasn’t stopped Taarabt from being the butt of some dressing-room banter. ‘We’ve had a few laughs here and there about it but Adel doesn’t take anything to heart,’ he said.

McCarthy was part of the Reading team who were relegated two seasons ago and a return to the Championship with Rangers is already a distinct possibility.

But the man who was an unused England squad member in 2013 decided to take that chance instead of rejoining Brendan Rodgers, briefly his manager at Reading.

‘A lot of people have asked how I could turn down a Champions League team,’ he said. ‘It was a tough decision, the toughest I’ve had to make in football but with myself still being young, the main thing was playing games.’

McCarthy claims the issues surrounding Adel Taarabt have not had any influence on the 'focused' squad
