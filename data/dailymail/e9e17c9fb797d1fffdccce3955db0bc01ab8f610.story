A zookeeper literally has to p-p-p-ick up a penguin every night because she cannot sleep until she has had a cuddle.

Webster was separated from her natural parents when she was just three days old after they rejected her, and was instead taken under the wing of John Pickering and his family.

Having been nursed by Mr Pickering night and day for three months, the cute Humboldt penguin now thinks he is her surrogate father, and refuses to go to sleep until he has given her a loving hug.

Birds of a feather: Webster, an 11-year-old Humboldt penguin, will not go to sleep without a goodnight cuddle from her surrogate father, John Pickering

Mr Pickering, who has worked at Sewerby Hall Zoo in East Yorkshire for 34 years, said: 'It’s possible she thinks she’s a human, since 
she grew up in our family home. She looks at me like a surrogate dad, so
we have a really close bond.

'Every evening she likes to follow me round, watching me put all the other penguins to bed. It’s like she’s helping me.

'Then,
when it comes to her bedtime, she won’t go to bed without a hug, so I 
have to put my arm around her and give her a little scratch on her 
head.'

Webster - named by Mr Pickering's two 
sons James and Thomas due to her webbed feet - had to be fed four times a
day at regular intervals for the first three months of her life, starting at 6.30am and not finishing until midnight.

She was born in 2002 to parents Rosie and Dion, but was rejected by them because they already had another chick.

To ensure she survived, the Pickerings had to mimic the penguin's feeding technique to make sure Webster, now 11, ate properly.

Mr Pickering said: 'We started off with blended up fish, salt water and a vitamin supplement in a syringe.

'It
takes two people to feed (a penguin) so it’s quite difficult. I had to pick up my 
wife from work and we’d both go back at lunchtime and feed her - it was a
lot of running around.

'After
about a month she could eat small fish, so it was a lot easier. My 
sons, who at that time were about 17 and 15, named her Webster because 
of her webbed feet.

'They 
didn’t know she was a girl at the time because you can’t tell until 
they’re a bit older. Females have a flatter head and males are more 
rounded.

'She was really 
part of the family. At the time we had a Norfolk terrier who Webster got
on well with. She answers to her own name when you call her.'

While
the family of four enjoyed having Webster living with them at their home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, they knew 
that she would have to be reintegrated with the other penguins in the 
longer term.

Mr Pickering said: 'She was fine with
the other penguins. Obviously there is a pecking order and they assume 
rank but she’s never had any problems.'

And while she has been successfully integrated with the rest of the flock, she insists 
on 'helping' John at work, following him on his rounds every evening to 
put the other birds to bed.

When it comes to her turn she cannot sleep without a goodnight hug from
her ‘dad’, so he bends down to give the 18ins bird a cuddle.
