Borussia Dortmund duo Shinji Kagawa and Ilkay Gundogan stepped up their fitness regimes as they linked up with the rest of their teammates in training on Monday.

Kagawa, who recently rejoined the German side from Manchester United after a two-year absence, was pictured alongside Gundogan and the rest of the squad with a big week fast approaching for Jurgen Klopp's side.

They play SC Freiburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday before welcoming a familiar face in the shape of Arsenal in their first Champions League group stage game of the season on Tuesday.

Both Kagawa and Gundogan returned to action for Dortmund in a friendly against their U23 side on Friday, with the latter enjoying his first taste of action in over a year after missing all of last season with a back injury.

The imminent return of both players to the first team will come as a huge boost to Klopp, who has just lost star striker Marco Reus for at least a month due to an ankle injury.
