Chelsea striker Diego Costa has stated he is happy to put personal accolades to one side in order to help his side win the Premier League title.

Costa is currently leading the Premier League goalscoring charts with 15 goals from 18 league games, however the former Atletico Madrid ace insists winning domestic honours is more important than winning the Golden Boot.

Speaking to Chelsea's official website, Costa said: 'Of course it is nice to be the top scorer but when I came here my aim was to win the league.

'The most important thing is the club going well, like we did in the other leagues I played in, and it would be nice at the end of the season to see the team doing well as well as the individual.

'Fifteen goals is a good mark and I hope to improve it, but more important than my goals is the team is winning.'

The 26-year-old has thanked Chelsea's midfielders for helping him find the back of the net on a consistent basis.

He added: 'If my first goal didn’t come in the first few games I would have still been confident. 

'That is because the team we have is such a great one and the ability of the players that play in midfield and feed the striker is very high, so I always knew goals would come.'

Costa, who netted in Chelsea's 2-0 win against Newcastle, will be hoping to add to his current tally when he comes up against Swansea at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday afternoon.
