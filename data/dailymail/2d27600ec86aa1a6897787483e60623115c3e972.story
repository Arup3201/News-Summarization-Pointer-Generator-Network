Today is the Summer Solstice, otherwise known as the longest day of the year.

And it’s not just the druids who will be celebrating – as we are set for a return of the sunshine, with temperatures expected to hit 24C (75F) this weekend.

The warm weather is predicted to last throughout tomorrow and could even stretch into the first week of Wimbledon.

Forecasters at the Met Office said today and tomorrow will be mainly dry, with bright sunny spells across most of the UK. London and the South East will be the warmest, with a maximum temperature of 24C (75F), while other parts of England and Wales can expect temperatures in the low to mid-twenties.

Temperatures are expected to reach 24C across Britain today, including in Brighton (above) for the longest day of the year

Despite it being marginally cooler in the north of England and in Scotland, students from Durham University took to Golden Sands beach at Tynemouth to enjoy the sunshine

Forecaster Helen Waite said: ‘It’s 
good outdoors over the weekend. It will be mostly dry and quite 
pleasantly warm across the country. It will start to cloud over in the 
afternoons but there will be spells of sunshine. Although there is a 
good chance of showers by Monday, generally speaking the fine weather 
will continue.’

A spokesman for the Weather Channel 
backed up the sunny forecast, saying it will be ‘a fine and dry weekend 
ahead for most of Britain’.

The prognosis also looks good for 
Wimbledon attendees, with the tournament starting on Monday – and even 
music fans heading for Glastonbury festival on Wednesday could be spared
 the traditional wet, muddy scenes. The only negative could be for hay 
fever sufferers – with pollen levels expected to be high. A Met Office 
spokesman said: ‘It is going to be quite sunny in most places over the 
weekend with temperatures continuing to creep up.

‘We are confident the high pressure 
will stick around until at least Wednesday and Thursday, though it may 
break down, bringing some showers.’ She added: ‘It is a good start to 
Wimbledon and Glastonbury, though pollen levels are very high.’

There was romance in the air on Friday
 - coined the Feel Good Day of the year by experts - as one man made the
 most of the bright sunshine and proposed to his girlfriend.

The
 man got down on one knee and popped the question on the stepping stones
 in the famous Cambridge University Botanic Garden as temperatures 
reached 23C across Britain.

His
 girlfriend looked delighted as they hugged and kissed against the 
backdrop of the spectacular lake covered with lily pads in the famous 
40-acre gardens.

The gardens, which date back to 1846, 
are a pretty oasis in Cambridge and have sprung to life in the sunshine,
 with plenty of pretty and colourful flowers for visitors to enjoy.

Long bouts of sunshine, holiday excitement and major sporting events all contributed to making Friday the feel-good day of the year, according to wellbeing guru Dr Cliff Arnall.

Former Cardiff University lecturer Dr Arnall, who is a happiness coach for celebrities and business leaders, fed every date of the year into a mathematical ‘happiness’ equation and today - the third Friday in June - came out with the highest score.

The psychologist’s formula used numbers representing ‘positivity factors’ including the weather, social interaction, holiday anticipation, childhood summer memories and blossoming nature.

With temperatures reaching 23C in some parts of the country today, and sunshine set to last the weekend, Dr Arnall believes the weather is key to our happiness.

It comes despite England’s defeat to Uruguay in Brazil last night, which Dr Arnall said didn’t affect the mood across the country.

Instead, he said the World Cup’s ‘unifying’ positive impact was stronger than worries about the national team and said the national mood was boosted by tennis fans’ ‘great belief’ that Wimbledon champion Andy Murray will retain his crown when the tournament kicks off on Monday.

Dr Arnall, 48, based in Powys, Wales, said: ‘No matter what the England team has done in Brazil, the World Cup is a unifying force bringing people of different nations together and giving us an insight into Brazilian culture and fun-loving attitude.

‘And fans enjoy watching big games on TV, no matter who’s playing.

O + (N x S) + Cpm/T + He = Happiness

Put more simply, a numerical value for being outdoors (O) was added to nature (N) multiplied by social interaction (S), added to childhood summer memories and positive thoughts (Cpm) divided by temperature (T), and added to holiday excitement (He).

‘Many people love Wimbledon and the event will boost optimism as, for the first time in generations, we have a champion and fans have even greater belief Andy Murray can win it again this year.’

The lifestyle guru also cited economic progress and above-average temperatures as contributions to making today the happiest of the year.

He said: ‘Good, dry weather is another feel-good factor after the wet start to the year - bringing great opportunities including beach trips and picnics, plus anticipation of more super weather later in summer.

‘The economy is improving and moving in a positive direction - but many people are still concerned about jobs and financial security.

‘An easy way to get happier is to put more fun in your life - and don’t take yourself too seriously.’

While the weather is contributing to the happiness factor across the country today, the warm temperatures are set to last long into the weekend.

The Met Office said this weekend would be mainly dry with bright, sunny spells across most of the country.

Temperatures will hit 23C across many parts of the country today before rising to 24C in central London tomorrow. The south-east is in for a fine weekend, with plenty of sunshine, while most of England and Wales will see temperatures in the low to mid-twenties.

While today has been deemed the happiest day of the year, a wellbeing report has revealed British people are getting happier in general. The survey shows 77 per cent of adults rate life satisfaction 75.9 per cent higher than they did in 2011/2012.

While today has been deemed the happiest day of the year, a Government wellbeing report has revealed British people are getting happier in general.

Results of a survey carried out by the Office of National Statistics shows 77 per cent of adults rate life satisfaction at between seven and 10 out of 10, which is up from 75.9 per cent from 2011/2012.

It recorded lower crime and greater happiness with accommodation as reasons for the improvement.
