This is the terrifying moment a teenage girl is almost crushed to death as a car hurtles through the front of a pizza store. 

A surveillance camera caught the near-fatal incident happening at Pudge Brothers Pizza in Aurora, Colorado, around 5pm on Wednesday.

Footage shows the unidentified 15-year-old being driven through the front of the restaurant as a vehicle rams her from behind. 

She is suddenly showered with shards of glass as the window breaks before her. Furniture from  the eatery is upturned and pushed forwards.

Miraculously the girl appears to be okay as she gets up from the bonnet and walks away.

A passer-by stops at the front door to check out the situation.

The sedan then appears to start backing up.

Police told CBS News that the driver accidentally took her foot off the break, which caused her to speed forwards out of control.

Her  15-year-old son, who was sat in the passenger seat, suffered a bloody nose and was taken to hospital.

The teenager she hit was also checkout by medics. Both patients were fortunate to be released with only minor injuries.

Roma Butenko, a Pudge Brothers Pizza employee, said he felt very lucky to escape the accident unscathed. 

He was serving up slices from behind the counter when chaos ensued. 

Butenko recently moved to the U.S from Ukraine and added that he felt a 'higher power' was involved.

'I feel very, big lucky,' he said. 'The car stopped just one half meter from me. Phew.'

'God helped me, yes, it’s a god.'

Pudge Brothers Pizza resumed business on Thursday but the storefront was mostly boarded up.

Authorities will not be pressing charges against the driver as the case was deemed an accident.
