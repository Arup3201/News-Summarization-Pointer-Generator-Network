He revealed in a recent interview that his relationship with Bo Bruce was a publicity stunt to earn her more votes on The Voice.

But now a source close to the singer has hit back at The Script frontman Danny O'Donoghue, insisting Bo will 'never forgive him' for making their relationship seem less than it was.

In the interview with Daily Mail reporter Spencer Bright last week, Danny had said: ‘I didn’t deny or confirm the 
speculation. I found it funny. By not saying anything, it created its 
own buzz. I thought I’d use it, and help Bo get publicity.'

However, Bo has been left devastated and 'emotionally exhausted' by the interview, which she sees as further indication that Danny never really cared about her.

The source exclusively told MailOnline: 'Bo and Danny's relationship was real and not a publicity stunt, despite Danny's claim that it was.

'Danny asked Bo to lie about it and never 
admit it, but she was disgusted that he claimed it was just for 
publicity. That was when they fell out for good... and she will never 
forgive him for it.'

Emotionally exhausted: The source also claims Danny wanted nothing to do with promotion of the single they wrote together, Alive

According to the source, Bo and Danny's relationship came to an end when he attempted to win back his ex Irma Mali - who banned him from having any more to do with Bo.

The source added: 'They are no longer friends and he 
abandoned Bo whilst trying to win back his ex, who made him promise not 
to associate himself with Bo.'

While Bo and Danny worked together on the single Alive, from Bo's album Before I Go To Sleep, the source claims that aside from writing the track together, Danny refused to have anything else to do with the song after the pair fell out following their split.

The source said: 'Apart from the co-write of Alive last 
year and one tweet about her album that bandmate Glenn tweeted for him 
earlier this year, Danny has refused to support Bo.

'He did not help Bo 
promote the single Alive because they couldn't be seen together or 
talk about their work together, which Bo feels totally jeopardised the
 promo campaign for the single and possibly her career.'

MailOnline has contacted a Danny for a response.
