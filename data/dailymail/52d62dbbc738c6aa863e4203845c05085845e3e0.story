The Navy SEAL who shot three bullets into Osama Bin Laden's head said putting the terrorist leader in his place is less stressful than putting a golf ball.

'Golf’s more stressful than combat,' esteemed Navy SEAL Rob O’Neill, 28, told the New York Post on Friday at The Tuscany Hotel in New York.

O'Neill told reporters that a psychiatrist once suggested he take up golf as a way of 'relieving post-traumatic stress' but that it had an opposite effect.

'The last psychiatrist I spoke to recommended golfing to relieve stress — and that’s a bad idea,' O’Neill said.

O'Neill was known as 'the shooter' in the team of six men responsible for Bin Laden's death.

O'Neill lwanted to stay under the radar after he killed Bin Laden but he told reporters, 'it was a big secret to keep.'

O'Neill once even skipped a breakfast for the families of 9/11 victims because he was afraid he would be revealed.

After time passed, O'Neill met with the family of Victims of 9/11 and he donated his combat shirt to the memorial in New York City. That was just his first step in his career path dedicated to helping those affected by war time trauma. 

O'Neill realized that his next purpose in life would be to help families and also aid veterans by acting as an advocate for their rights.

'When I saw the healing, I came to the realization that it’s bigger than me,' he said.

'It’s irresponsible of me to try not to help more families.'

'I’ve assumed risks before, and I’m going to do it again because this is worth it,' he said.

O'Neill, who travels with full security around New York City, said he has to figure out what to do now after 16 years of impressive service.

He even aided in the 'Captain Phillips' rescue off the Somalia Coast.

He has had a hard time adjusting to the calmness of everyday life.

'I had to figure out what to do to keep food on the table, keep the lights on and stuff,' he said.

O'Neill has started an organization to raise money for retired soldiers called YourGratefulNation.org.

'I think that everyone that does transition, they should be as successful as possible,' he said.

'If they can use their past for future success, I think they should.'

Although those looking to play golf may want to think twice.
