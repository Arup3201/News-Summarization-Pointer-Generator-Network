They have already made it on to the big screen once - and now United's famous Class of '92 are set to become TV stars again.

The BBC have commissioned a three-part documentary on Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Gary and Phil Neville as they attempt to turn around the fortunes of non-league Salford City.

The group, who starred in the Class of '92 feature film about their rise through the ranks at Manchester United, took on the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League side, who averaged crowds of 150, along with investors last year.

And the broadcaster has promised a warts and all look at a world eight rungs beneath and a million miles away from the Premier League.

The documentary will feature the famous fivesome getting to grips with running a lower level football club which includes menial tasks such as managing the grass seed budget. At one point Phil Neville is said to offer to make the half-time cups of tea.

The show also examines politics at the club and resistance to some of the changes brought about following the take-over - not least the controversial decision to change the Ammies' home shirts from orange to red.

Plans to renovate the centuries-old ground, re-fit the toilets and build a new clubhouse, which presumably received a more favourable response, also feature.

Ahead of the series launch, the BBC say the show will concentrate on the group's dreams of 'turning Salford City F.C in to a new model for all football clubs – rooted in the community, discovering untapped talent, and turning local players into heroes'.

They add: 'Meanwhile, the big Salford characters who run the club are hoping that their fortunes are about to change after years of struggling to survive.'

BBC One Controller Charlotte Moore was involved in commissioning the series, which will air on the channel later this year.

She said: 'It's a real coup to give BBC One viewers such extraordinary access through this new documentary series, which follows the story of these famous ex-Manchester United players and football heroes. It's a window into a passionate local community, as this club has a chance to be part of a bigger playing field and realise their dreams.'

Paul Scholes made 718 appearances for Manchester United in all competitions, scoring 155 goals
