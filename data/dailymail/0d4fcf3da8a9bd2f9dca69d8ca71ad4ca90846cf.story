McDonald's has added mozzarella sticks to its menu - with the obligatory 'McMarinara' sauce on the side. 

The fast-food chain is test-running the snack in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut with three pieces being sold for a dollar.

The menu item is not entirely new - the cheesy item was previously available in the UK and called Mozzarella Dippers.

In fact, the item was so popular among British fast-food eaters that a petition was set up on Facebook entitled 'Keep Mozzarella Sticks in McDonalds UK all year round'. 

The new fast-food option was spotted by Grubgrade in northern New Jersey.

McDonald's told MailOnline today: 'It’s premature to speculate on the decisions we may make after the test, but we’re excited to share this menu item with our customers in this test market.' 

They have 260kcal per serving of the sticks with an additional 50kcal for the Italian tomato dip. 

The reaction to the limited roll-out has been varied. On Twitter, one user @austintobler3 enthusiastically tweeted: 'Mcdonalds having mozzarella sticks is the greatest thing of all time.'  

 Another positive endorsement came from @lesenez who tweeted: 'Mozzarella sticks are back at McDonald's all my prayers have been answered.' 

Twitter user @melarenass seemed more dubious, writing: 'Dad came home with mozzarella sticks from mcdonalds what...'

McMozzarella sticks are yet another way that McDonald's are shaking up their menu to try to attract new customers.  

In the past 18 months, the chain has introduced the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches and rolled out chicken wraps as its first menu item with cucumbers.

Last fall, it announced plans to give people the choice of a salad instead of fries in combo meals. And in coming months, mandarins will be offered in Happy Meals, with other fruits being explored as well.

The company faces an uphill battle, especially if the past is any indication. The salads it introduced more than a decade ago account for just two to three per cent of sales. And the chain last year discontinued its Fruit & Walnut salad and premium Angus burgers, which analysts said were priced too high for McDonald's customers at around $5. 

McDonald's is not the first to capitalize on America's love of the cheesy fingers - fast-food joints and chains Sonic, Applebee's, The Cheesecake Factory, Chilis, Red Lobster, Wendy's, Arby's and TGI Fridays all have mozzarella sticks on the menu. 

The three McMozzarella sticks are available for a dollar. No word yet on whether McDonald's plans to take the new item countrywide

McDonald's have been branching out with new items in the hopes of attracting new customers over the past   18 months
