The first screams come as the bus speeds through a stop sign.

The second ones happen as the disoriented driver falls to the floor and the bus - carrying 26 South Carolina fourth-graders back from a field trip - veers into a drainage ditch, 'just six inches from going over', according to a witness.

Lee Morris, a sign-language interpreter who works with a student the class, was seated in the first row and leapt to action.

Grabbing the wheel as the driver sat bewildered, Morris took control of the bus.

However the driver's position on the floor prevented him from getting into the front seat and applying the brakes, reported The Post and Courier.

'We have to stop the bus': Fourth grade teacher Amy Ryan jumps over the disoriented driver to apply the brakes and turn off the engine

Thinking quickly, teacher Amy Ryan jumped over the driver, slid into the seat and promptly brought the bus to a halt before turning the engine off.

'Sorry, sorry - it's ok,' she tells her students, who are still screaming from the dramatic scene.

The harrowing 30-second incident, which occurred on December 4 in Awendaw, was captured on video from the camera installed in the bus, which was en route back to Pinckney Elementary School from a field trip.

The bus was traveling along Bull Island Road and was supposed to make a left turn on Seewee Road, however the driver ran through a stop sign and made a late turn, running the bus off the road.

'It really felt like we were going to tip over,' Ryan said.

Besides a lot of tears, none of the children were injured.

It is not known what caused the driver, Michael Hacker, to lose control, however he has been fired by Durham School Services, the company that hires driver and assigns routes in the area.

Hacker was also issued with traffic citations for driving too fast for conditions and for not wearing a seat belt.

There were no seat belts for students on the bus.

Suzanne Kaufman, a parent whose son was on the bus, had gone on the field trip and was following the bus in her car.

She could see children crying through the bus' back window.

'They were about six inches from going over,' Kaufman said.

'I know they were terrified, but I'm probably the only one who saw how close they were to toppling over.'

Her son, Dustin, was on the side of the bus that would've hit the ground first.

'I was just in disbelief and felt powerless,' she said.

'There was nothing I could do. I kept saying to myself, ''When is this going to stop?''

Pinckney Elementary Principal Leanne Sheppard said she was proud of Morris and Ryan.

'It was so unpredictable,' said .

'I am so proud of them.

'It really was putting their lives in jeopardy. They kept their composure and were so professional, not only in the moment, but afterward when they were soothing children and addressing their well-being.'

Morris' and Ryan's instinctive reactions prevented a bad situation from becoming worse.

'It sounds cliche, but you don't think about what you're doing,' Morris said.

'You see a situation and you react. I obviously saw (the driver) was on the floor, and we were not where we were supposed to be. You just jump up and do.'

Ryan agreed.

'I honestly think it's just instinct,' she said.

'I don't remember thinking anything other than, ''I just want the bus stopped''.'
