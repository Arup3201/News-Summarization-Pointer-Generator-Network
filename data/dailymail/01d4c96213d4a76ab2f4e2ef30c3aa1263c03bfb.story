Britain is to hand over an expected £600million more to fight global warming in the Third World including cash to build sea and flood defences.

Angry MPs said last night that voters would not understand why money is being sent overseas when not enough has been done to shore up flood defences here.

Earlier this year homes and fields in Somerset were flooded as a result of the wettest winter on record. Some local people believe the Environment Agency’s decision to stop dredging rivers was also a factor. Days ago pictures emerged of water rising again on the Somerset Levels.

The latest handout will be announced by David Cameron on Thursday, the day of the Rochester and Strood by-election. 

But many Tory MPs believe voters are sick of seeing taxpayers’ money sent abroad to tackle fashionable causes.

The massive giveaway risks becoming a propaganda gift to Ukip which is confident of winning the by-election. The party has exploited public scepticism about climate change and the value of foreign aid.

Some of the funding will go on flood defences amid fears that climate change will lead to more adverse weather. But Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘At a time when we in our own country have suffered from flooding and devastation, with potentially more to come, this doesn’t send out the right message.

‘The overwhelming mood in the country is that the first duty of government is to look after this country. It sends a confusing message to people affected by flooding here that we are spending so much on flood defences overseas rather than at home. I don’t think this will help us win the general election.’

Residents are concerned not enough is being done to prevent flooding again this year in Somerset. A car and caravan can be seen in a flooded field in February 

The donation will be handed to the new United Nations Green Climate Fund, which is being set up to help developing countries cut their carbon emissions and prepare for the effects of climate change.

Government sources refused to disclose the exact size of the commitment last night, but confirmed it will run into ‘hundreds of millions of pounds’. The money is likely to be taken from Britain’s £11.5billion aid budget, part of which is earmarked for helping countries deal with climate change.

Critics claimed handing more money to foreign flood defences 'did not send out the right message'

One source indicated that Britain’s contribution is unlikely to be less than the amount given by France and Germany who have each pledged $1billion (£625 million). The US will donate $3billion.

Mr Cameron initially appeared to suggest that Britain would not contribute to the new fund, saying the UK had ‘more than played its part’ in the fight against climate change.

But, speaking at his closing press conference at the G20 summit in Brisbane yesterday, the Prime Minister confirmed a major donation would be announced this week.

Mr Cameron insisted the cash was not ‘new money’ and attempted to play down the significance of the move.

The Prime Minister said: ‘Britain has already set aside a substantial sum for green climate funds, and all we have to do now is decide how much of that already set aside money to put into this specific fund.

‘As ever in these things Britain will play its part and play a very constant part.

‘It’s been good that some other countries have been encouraged to come forward and put some money there. But everyone knows Britain will play our part because we’ve already set aside money, so when we make an announcement it won’t be new money.’

Peter Bone, Conservative MP for Wellingborough, said voters would not understand why their money was being ‘wasted’ in this way.

‘We have not got enough money to provide enough firefighters and police officers locally, so to spend £600million on what I would say is a wasted project just seems crackers,’ he said.

Roger Helmer, Ukip’s energy spokesman, suggested Mr Cameron was engaged in a vanity exercise to maintain his standing among world leaders.

Mr Helmer said: ‘Cameron is preparing to play “me too” with hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money. Money that could be better spent at home.’
