with his son, Drew, now 10-years-old, the boy’s mother Padmashini Devi 
Drees, 38, was in the hands of the police.

The couple 
had divorced not long before and shared custody of their son. It is 
believed that the mother decided to return to India to raise her son 
because she didn't have any family in McKinney.

Police obtained a warrant in Jan. 2007 for Drew and a BOLO was issued for the missing child.

The case remained open for many years and police eventually determined the child had been taken to India.

Investigators monitored her location with the assistance of INTERPOL, the Department of State, United States Customs and other agencies.

They recently learned that the had mother decided to return to the U.S. because she thought it was best for her son.

A plan was put motion and Padmashini was arrested at DFW Airport on Tuesday night when her flight arrived.

‘We are just so happy to have brought this reunion together,’ Dep. Chief Kim Malolepszy with the McKinney Police Department told Fox4.

Padmashini faces a charge of interference with child custody, with bond set at $10,000. Police said she could face additional charges.

Padmashini remains in jail and Homeland Security has placed a hold on her, so she cannot bond out.

The National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children’s Family Advocacy Division are helping with the 
father and son reacquaint.

Drew’s father, Dean, remarried and had more children, but he never stopped searching for his son.

The father and son had started talking on the phone and via Facebook in recent months before Padmashini decided it was time for Drew to return home.

‘She wanted to come back and live in America,’ said Malolepszy.
