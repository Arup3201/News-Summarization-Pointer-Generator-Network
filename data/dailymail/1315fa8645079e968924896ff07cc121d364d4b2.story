Olympic mascots Wenlock and Manderville are eye-catching at the best of times.

But today Londoners were treated to a special sight as the energetic cycloptic duo invaded London in a bizarre array of disguises.

A collection of 83 sculptures of the couple were planted at sites around the city as part of a new 'discovery' trail to promote the Games.

Can you see him? A collection of 83 sculptures of the couple were planted at sites around the city as part of a new 'discovery' trail to promote the Games

The two-metre tall figures are part of 
Stroll, six individual discovery trails around the city, with the aim of
encouraging Londoners and tourists alike to explore the capital on 
foot.Each outfit represents a different element of the capital's culture.

The sculptures have already proved popular with tourists and children who were keen to have their pictures taken beside the one-eyed icons.

They include a Cockney Wenlock, with illustrations of well-known cockney 
rhyming slang terms all over his body and Punk Mandeville, who 
looks every inch the rebellious anarchist.

The one-eyed cartoon mascots represent droplets of steel that was used to build the Olympic stadium, organisers have revealed.

Strategically placed: The models popped up at a string of locations around London

The duo require a certain amount of 
explanation before they begin to make any sense.

Firstly the names, which might ring a few geographical bells.

Wenlock is named after the Shropshire town of Much Wenlock where, in
the mid-19th century, the Wenlock Games became one of the inspirations
for the modern Olympic movement.

Mandeville's name is derived from Stoke Mandeville, in Buckinghamshire, home to Stoke Mandeville Hospital.

Judge Wenlock: Wenlock is named after the Shropshire town of Much Wenlock where, in the mid-19th century, the Wenlock Games became one of the inspirations for the modern Olympic movement

Cast in the fires of Bolton: They are said to have been fashioned from the last drops
of steel left over from the final support girder of the Olympic stadium when it was made in Bolton

Doctor Wenlock: He is named after the Shropshire town of Much Wenlock where, in the mid-19th century, the Wenlock Games became one of the inspirations for the modern Olympic movement

Westminster Abbey Wenlock: The duo require a certain amount of explanation before they begin to make any sense

In the 1940s Dr Ludwig Guttman came to the hospital to set up a new
spinal unit to help former soldiers suffering from spinal cord
injuries.

Looking for ways to inspire those in his care he encouraged
them to take up sport and the Stoke Mandeville Games was formed, widely
recognised as a forerunner of the modern Paralympic movement.

Then there is there appearance. A whole story has been created to
explain that - they are said to have been fashioned from the last drops
of steel left over from the final support girder of the Olympic stadium when it was made in Bolton.

Tourist Mandeville: The duo were fashioned into figures and magically came to life and set about making a journey to the Olympics in London

Fun: The sculptures have already proved popular 
with tourists and children who were keen to have their pictures taken 
beside the one-eyed icons

Working hard: Rainbow Arts And Crafts Co in Dafeng, China, has shipped nearly 500,000 mascots of Wenlock and Mandeville for the coming Olympic and Paralympic Games
