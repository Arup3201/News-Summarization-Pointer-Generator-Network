An eight-year-old Palestinian girl is opposing the Israeli occupation of her West Bank village - with a mobile telephone.

Jana Tamimi makes news reports about the regular conflicts with Israeli soldiers in Nabi Saleh, filming video on a camera phone and posting it online.

She films her reports about her village at a time when demonstrations against Israeli settlements are taking place on a weekly basis after Friday prayers.

Eight year old Palestinian girl, Jana Tamimi, is possibly the world's youngest citizen journalist

Tamimi said she wants to deliver the voice of her people to the world so they can gain more international support.

'When we started to go out for marches there weren't a lot of photographers with us so I had an idea to document and deliver our message. 

'The message of all Palestinians and Palestinian children to the world so they come to support us and to free Palestine and live under freedom and get our rights.' 

Jana has been recording footage and uploading weekly news reports online - all from her smartphone

Her village of Nabi Saleh has long experienced Israeli occupation and have weekly demonstrations to protest

Residents of Nabi Saleh, which has a population of around 600, say 60 per cent of the village's territory has been seized by settlers, including a local spring, which they demand access to.

Protests are held weekly by local Palestinians and international peace activists to express their disapproval about land lost to Israel settlements and have been for the past five years.

'The occupation is depriving us even from the most important right, which is the right to live, the right of swimming in the sea,' Tamimi added.

'When we go to school we always get delayed at barriers, which make us late for lessons at school.

'We want to live in freedom so when we walk in the street no settler will run us over.

We want to feel that our land is secure and that we can walk in the street or on the hills anywhere without having Zionists shooting us or settlers running us over.'

Jana hopes that by filming the soldiers and her village, she can bring the voice of her people to the world

Jana's Mother, Nawal Tamimi, told Reuters TV that her daughter's activism is a result of growing up surrounded by conflict.

'The demonstrations started in Nabi Saleh when she was three-years-old. 

'Because our home is at the entrance of the village we are in the centre of the events where the clashes take place and where the firing of tear gas and other grenades take place as well, so she grew up with fear and pain.'

'The occupation is depriving us even from the most important right, which is the right to live,' Jana says

About 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem among 2.4 million Palestinians.

The World Court has deemed Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal. 

Many Jewish settlers claim a God-given right to the West Bank, which they call by the biblical names Judea and Samaria.
