This silver pocket watch saved the life of a World War One soldier fighting for Britain on the Somme - by stopping a German bullet from piercing his chest.

The two-inch timepiece was unearthed by the family of Corporal Walter Davis, who served on the Western Front in France when he was just 22 years old.

The soldier joined the 9th Battalion North Staffordshire Regiment in 1915 - and was sent straight to the front line, where he battled German forces during the Battle of the Somme.

Relatives: The story of Cpl Davis's close encounter was passed down his family for generations, but the watch was only recently unearthed by his granddaughter Linda Ward. Above, Ms Ward with her daughter Louise, 23

During the fierce conflict, Cpl Davis and his platoon came under heavy fire from the trenches - and a bullet was shot directly at his chest.

But thanks to the solid silver watch, the soldier incredibly survived.

Despite the story of his miracle escape being passed down his family for generations, the damaged watch was only recently uncovered by his granddaughter Linda Ward - 50 years later.

Ms Ward, 59, from Telford, Shropshire, discovered the timepiece in her late father's dusty attic, along with the metal bullet and Cpl Davis's diary documenting his time at war.

'I was told about it by my dad when I was 15 and he showed me the watch and his diary that he kept,' she said.

'My grandad died when I was 12 so I remember him but he never talked about the war. My dad died in 2006 and he had the watch and diary but you know how it is when someone dies, it takes a while to go through everything.

'I think we started looking at the belongings about a year ago and uncovered the diary. I was stunned, I had seen it when I was a little but only a couple of times as it is so special. I had pretty much forgotten about it.

'He was hit in the chest when he was in the trenches, the soldier next to him was shot in the head and died. It has become a bit of a family legend but no one has ever known the exact details - he took that to his grave.'

Cpl Davis's fascinating short diary - which has no dates or locations - documents the horror of what he saw on a daily basis during the conflict. 

In it, the soldier wrote: 'My thoughts are that I shall never see England again. One of these days I shall get it, but I am more used to it now and I don't care what comes.

'If I am to die here, I shall, and if not here then somewhere else, for they are all going a few at a time.'

In the Soldier's Small Book, a type of diary issued by the Army to all service men, Cpl Davis does not mention being hit by the bullet.

However, he does record a number of other experiences - including how close he came to death on several occasions.

He wrote: 'I had some very near shaves myself. I have twice been smothered with earth and once while building up a parapet I had to lie flat on my stomach so as to render the brother Boche from seeing me.

'A shell came over and buried itself on the other side of the trench, not a yard away from me. Had it exploded there would have no more of me, I should have been in bits.

'It was often such things as these that I have always thought of home, how I longed for it to be all over.'

He added: 'Our first casualties occurred when we were digging a trench 200 yards of the Boche front line when we lost about six wounded.

'A few days later I lost one of my best men in the section, poor Jim Ford, a good living man and always a willing worker.

Colleagues: Despite Cpl Davis's dedication to the 9th Battalion North Staffordshire Regiment, he was sent home after badly injuring his leg. Above, the soldier is reportedly pictured with other members of his platoon

'He got 
hit working in the village with a nose cap of a shell, we buried him 
with full military honour and put a beautiful cross to mark which I know
 is there today.'

The Prince of Wales's North Staffordshire Regiment served Britain from 1881 to 1959, including during World War One
 and World 
War Two.

It also 
fought for the country in other conflicts, such as the Second Sudanese War, 
the Second Boer War, the Anglo-Irish War and the Third Anglo-Afghan War.

Formed as a
 service battalion in Lichfield in September 1914, the 9th Battalion was
 heavily involved in the First World War.

It moved to Hastings in December 1914, before becoming a pioneer battalion in 1915.

For the next three years, it fought German troops in France during the Battle of the Somme.

Despite Cpl Davis's dedication to his platoon, he was forced to return home 12 months later after badly injuring his leg.

The soldier was shot as he was leading his platoon into No Man's Land at 3.15am during the fierce battle.

In
 his diary, he wrote: 'Nothing doing much until we get to the Somme. No 
one knew where we were going to, all as we knew it might be our resting 
place.

'We knew it was hell we were going because we were told we had got to shift the Boche out of it. 

'We
 shifted him right enough, but, oh the awful mess, nothing but corpses 
everywhere. I put my foot on a poor chap, but could not help it, there 
were so many.

'We
 lost a terrible lot of men and so did a good many regiments, but I kept
 on coming through. I was now in charge of the platoon. 

'We are going over again this morning at 3.15 and something is going to happen.'

His last entry reads: 'I am not in hospital having got wounded in the leg going over the third line of the Boche. 

Family: Ms Ward, 59, is pictured with her daughter Louise and Cpl Davis's possessions, including the watch

'I
 arrived in England on the 17th July and want to stop in England. I have
 had enough of being in France after 11 months and 14 days.'

After 
returning from the war, Cpl Davis worked as a bricklayer in Wednesfield,
 West Midlands, where he remained until his death at the age of 76.

He
 was already married to Harriet Ann Betts, and they went on to have two 
children, nine grandchildren, 19 great-grandchildren and 15 great-great 
grandchildren.

Ms Ward's daughter Louise, 23, one of Cpl Davis's great-grandchildren, has now turned the soldier's diary entries into a book.

Concern: In his unearthed diary, the soldier wrote: 'My thoughts are that I shall never see England again'

The
 art student from Walsall, said: 'He didn't have any children before the
 war so if it wasn't for that watch in the top pocket of his uniform 
jacket I wouldn't be here.

'In
 fact, there are 45 people from four generations who wouldn't be here 
now. The watch was just in the right place. The bullet hit at the 
thickest bit of it.

'It is just amazing to think of it really and I find the whole story so interesting.'
