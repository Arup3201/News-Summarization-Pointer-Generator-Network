A legal executive has been jailed for stealing money from her employers to 'buy friends' with lavish outings - including two trips to see singer Neil Diamond in one week.

Ruth Turner, 46, siphoned off £205,000 from Kundert Solicitors in Coventry between February 2009 to September 2011.

The extensive fraud went undetected by colleagues at the firm's Bell Green office until Turner confessed to police last year.

Turner was jailed for three years at Coventry Crown Court for fraud by abuse of position.

Using the completion of house sales as cover, she transferred around £10,000 at a time into her bank accounts. The most taken at once was £21,000.

The court heard she used the money to pay for home improvements and 'buy friends' with shopping sprees, meals and concert trips.

Prosecuting, Ian Ball told how Turner committed the crime because she found it a struggle to pay spiralling debts and had felt a social outcast most of her life.

Mr Ball said: 'She found by taking friends to lavish events, shopping, meals, that she was suddenly popular.

'The money was going out as quickly as it was coming in, spending some money on the house, taking friends out and going to live concerts including Neil Diamond twice in one week.'

He explained how she fled the firm's second office in Station Square in September last year, after an outburst that colleagues put down to personal problems.

Turner returned to work the next day but turned herself in at a police station the following Monday.

The court heard she'd handed over bank statements as proof of her fraud and told police she’d stolen about £400,000. However, lack of evidence meant she could only be charged for £205,000.

Turner, of Hinckley, Leicestershire, has a son at university and was the primary carer for her 75-year-old mother. She joined the firm as a secretary in 2006, rising to conveyancing executive on an annual salary of £36,000.

Graham Russell, defending, painted a picture of a woman 'driven to desperation' against a background of an abusive relationship, financial problems and mental health issues including depression and compulsive behaviours.

He said his client felt so ashamed of what she had done, she attempted suicide before handing herself in to police.

Mr Russell said: 'Many people who suffer depression find themselves engaging in some form of compulsive activity.

'I would suggest, having in mind the abusive relationship she was in, having in mind that she was having difficulty with compulsive eating and compulsive drinking, that would go some way to explaining the compulsive stealing and compulsive spending.'

Sentencing Turner to three years in prison, Judge Richard Griffith-Jones described it as a 'serious abuse of trust' which in a tough economic climate put the company at risk and colleagues’ jobs in jeopardy.

On top of the loss, Kundert Solicitors has been left with doubled insurance premiums and a £100,000 investigation bill.

The judge said: 'You were doing it out of greed, and you weren’t really being as generous as you felt when you were treating friends with this extravagant lifestyle because it wasn’t your money to be generous with.'

A Kundert Solicitors official who attended the hearing declined to comment.
