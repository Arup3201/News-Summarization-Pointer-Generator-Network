John Dalton, 69, was arrested after breaking into a man's house and cooking corn on the cob

An elderly drunk was arrested in Massachusetts after he broke into a complete stranger's home and decided to cook himself corn on the cob, police said.

Cops in Rockland, about 23 miles south of Boston, received a break-in report about 1:40am on Wednesday.

The victim had woken up to loud bangs from his kitchen, the Enterprise reported.

When the man went to investigate, he found 69-year-old John Dalton cooking himself a late-night snack.

'(Dalton) decided to cook some corn on the cob on the individual’s stove top,' Lt. Nick Zeoli told the Enterprise.

The homeowner confronted Dalton and told him to leave.

Dalton took a swing at the man, according to the Enterprise. 

They scuffled briefly but neither was injured.

The next day, Dalton was taken to a hospital complaining of hip pains unrelated to his fight with the homeowner.

Dalton was charged with breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony and assault and battery.

Police say Dalton was 'clearly intoxicated' and forced his way through a side dor.

It is unclear if Dalton ever got around to eating any of the corn on the cob.
