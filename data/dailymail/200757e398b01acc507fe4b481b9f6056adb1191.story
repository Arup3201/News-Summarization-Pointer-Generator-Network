Click here for updates on Phil Hughes' condition after his injury 

Reaction from across the cricket world to the incident 

The cricket world is in shock after the news that Phil Hughes is in a critical condition after being hit on the head by a bouncer playing for South Australia against New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield.

Not only shock because of the extent of the Australian’s injuries but because this is an incident of unprecedented seriousness, certainly since helmets were introduced more than 30 years ago to significantly reduce the risk of being hurt while batting in cricket.

While what happened in the historic surroundings of the Sydney Cricket Ground can legitimately be called a freak incident perhaps the biggest surprise is that this sort of thing is, thankfully, so rare in the great game.

A cricket ball is a seriously hard, dangerous weapon when propelled at close to a 100 miles per hour by the best bowlers in the world and perhaps the most sobering thought after a truly horrible affair is that injury on this scale doesn’t happen more regularly.

Batsmen have been hit on the head and been badly hurt over the years - of course they have, and incidents involving Australian Rick McCosker, New Zealand’s Ewan Chatfield, Mike Gatting, Ricky Ponting and England’s Stuart Broad only last summer come to mind - but no-one that I can recall has been as badly hurt as the stricken Hughes.

There is no point blaming the safety equipment because cricket, as with so much sport, comes with an inherent risk and the great strides that have been made ever since Mike Brearley first appeared in the Seventies with a sort of skull cap and Dennis Amiss wore a motorcycle helmet have been huge.

Cricketers have always sought protection and there were tales of batsmen using towels, scarves and padded caps before Patsy Hendren was one of the first to use a self designed protective hat in the 1930s. 

World Series Cricket saw the first helmets being worn regularly, most notably by Warwickshire and England batsman Amiss, while Australia’s Graham Yallop was the first to wear a helmet in a Test, against West Indies in 1978.

The design and level of safety has evolved ever since but even last summer more moves were made to protect batsmen after Broad had been struck in the gap between his safety grille and the peak of his airtek helmet, commonly regarded now as the safest design, at Old Trafford against India and was lucky to escape serious injury.

But they cannot be foolproof and those batsmen who reach the very top will tell you that fear never enters their head. The last thing Hughes would have been thinking of was getting hurt as he attempted to pull a short ball from New South Wales' seamer Sean Abbott on Tuesday morning. Lesser players would have simply got out of the way. 

He and all other international batsmen would not be successful if they did worry about injury and fear is more likely to be found at a much lower level, where club players can be seen putting self-preservation ahead of the need to score runs, certainly lower order batsmen. 

There is a theory that helmets have actually increased the risk of injury in a weird sort of way, because they encourage the very best batsmen to go for more audacious shots than they would ever have attempted bare headed.

The art of ducking and weaving, for instance, as batsmen would have had to master against the great fast bowlers of a bygone age like Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, has almost disappeared in an era when batsmen, highly protected and with huge heavy bats, are dominant and bowlers are rarely as quick as they once were. 

None of which is particularly relevant to the plight of the talented and highly popular Hughes, a well regarded figure in the English county game as well as of an opponent of England’s, as he fights for his life in a Sydney hospital. 

His has been an up-and-down career at the highest level and he has not played a Test for Australia since struggling against England in the 2013 Ashes and scoring just one and one in the last of his 26 Tests to date at Lord’s.

But he was on the way back as far as Australia were concerned and was expected to play in the first Test against India because of injury to his friend and captain Michael Clarke, who was at his bedside on Tuesday after the horrific incident.

There is huge sympathy too for young fast bowler Abbott, 22, who was being comforted and offered psychological support after his unwitting part in this tragic affair. He will know that no-one blames him for beating Hughes' defences but that will not make him feel any the less distraught.

For now, the cricket community has come together in their support of one of their own. The world’s thoughts are with Phil Hughes and his family.
