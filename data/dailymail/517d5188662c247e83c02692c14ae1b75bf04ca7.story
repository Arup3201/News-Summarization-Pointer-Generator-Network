A fit and healthy runner collapsed and died half a mile from the finish of the London Marathon after taking a performance-enhancing stimulant, an inquest heard yesterday.

Claire Squires was determined to complete the course in under four hours to beat her personal best and raise thousands of pounds for charity.

But as she neared the finish of last year’s race, the young hairdresser suffered a cardiac arrest and never regained consciousness.

Tragic: Marathon runner Claire Squires, pictured, collapsed and died less than a mile before the finish line of the London Marathon last year after taking a now banned energy supplement

Her partner, Simon Van Herrewege, said
 the ‘beautiful’ 30-year-old was passionately against drugs and had 
‘innocently’ dissolved the popular sports supplement, which is now 
banned, in her water bottle to help her if she ‘hit a wall’.

The inquest heard she had bought the 
powder called Jack3d from the internet. Its main active ingredient was 
an amphetamine-like substance DMAA (dimethylamylamine) which boosts 
energy and metabolism, but had been banned in the US and Canada after 
two soldiers died during strenuous training after taking it.

Before its ban in this country last 
August, several months after Miss Squires’s death, it was one of the 
UK’s most popular legal stimulants.

Recording a narrative verdict, 
coroner Dr Philip Barlow said the combination of the DMAA with 
‘extensive physical exertion caused cardiac failure which resulted in 
her death.’

Outside Southwark Coroners Court, Mr 
Van Herrewege, flanked by Miss Squires’s family, called for tighter 
regulation of the health food and sports supplement industries.

Support: Donations flooded into Claire's Justgiving page after her death

Fighting
 back tears, the 31-year-old said: ‘Claire’s death has left a gaping 
hole in our hearts and in our lives, but we’ll always remember her with a
 big smile on her face, trying to make everyone she met feel good about 
themselves.

‘Claire was passionately against the 
use of drugs and would never, ever, have taken anything that would have 
caused her harm or even worse risked her life. She innocently took a 
supplement which at the time was entirely legal, and widely available on
 the high street, and somewhat worryingly, apparently used by so many 
others.

‘It’s clear that there needs to be far
 better supervision of the so-called health foods and supplements 
industry so that no more tragedies like this happen again.’ He added 
that the almost £1.2million raised in Miss Squires’s name for the 
Samaritans had given her family and friends much comfort.

Miss Squires, from North Kilworth in 
Leicestershire, was an experienced runner and committed fundraiser. She 
ran in memory of her brother Gary who died aged 25 from a drugs overdose
 in 2001.

Dr Barlow added: ‘I hope that the 
coverage of this case and events leading up to Claire’s death will help 
publicise the potential harmful effects of DMAA during extreme physical 
exertion.’

Claire Squires wanted to raise £500 for the Samaritans by running the London Marathon, but when news of her death became public last April, donations to her JustGiving page rocketed.

Within days, the total raised was more than £500,000. To date almost £1.2million has been pledged in her memory, and the Samaritans said several projects had been established in her name.

Mr Van Herrewege told the inquest that Miss Squires had taken the supplement once before but ‘never really got on with it’.

‘She said she was going to take one 
scoop of it in her water bottle and if she hit a wall she would take it 
to give her a boost.’

An off-duty paramedic said she saw Miss Squires, who ‘appeared tired and was slowing down’ just before she collapsed.

Dr Nicola Drake, an A&E consultant
 at St Thomas’s Hospital who tried to save Miss Squires, said DMAA had 
been linked to the deaths of two US soldiers. She added: ‘It would give 
someone a racing heart, increasing heart rate and make the heart work 
much harder than it naturally would.’

DMAA has also been linked with high blood pressure, headaches, vomiting and strokes.

Professor Sanjay Sharma, medical 
director of the London Marathon, said: ‘No-one, particularly athletes 
doing strenuous exercise, should take this supplement or indeed any 
performance-enhancing drugs. It should not be available to be bought 
either from shops or over the internet.

‘This is a tragedy that inadvertently cost a young girl her life.’

Banned: Jack3d contains a stimulant called DMAA

Jack3D contained a stimulant known as DMAA (dimethylamylamine) that has been linked to high blood pressure, headaches, vomiting, stroke and even death.

The UK’s medicines watchdog MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) ruled last August that it is unlicensed and that all other DMAA containing products needed to be removed from the market to protect public safety.

Although DMAA is not illegal to take or possess in the UK it is no longer licensed so cannot be sold.

The decision followed similar warnings around the world, including in the US and Australia where a man died after buying DMAA online.

Jack3d is said to boost energy, concentration and metabolism. But DMAA, most commonly used as a workout aid or dietary supplement, can have a physiological effect on the body by narrowing the arteries and raising the heart rate, said the MHRA.

This has been linked to suspected adverse drug reactions worldwide, ranging from shortness of breath to heart attacks.

An MHRA spokesperson said at the time: 'Jack3d is mainly bought over the internet although it is also available in sports stores specialising in work out products.

'If we find a shop selling it we will send them a written reminder asking them to remove it from their shelves. If they ignore this then our enforcement officers will move in and begin legal action.

'It is the most popular sports supplement in the UK because it is a stimulant that allows you to work out for longer.

'But it is for people who are really into their fitness. Your average person who goes to the gym once or twice a week is unlikely to have ever used it.'

A spokesman for the MHRA told MailOnline today it had 
tried to take it off the UK market prior to last August but it was 
delayed by an appeal from one of the retailers of the product.
