The Prime Minister announced plans for the new HS3 rail line despite holding a review into the cost of HS2

Plans for another high-speed rail line in the North will go ahead, say ministers – but they admitted last night they had no idea how much it would cost.

On the day the Government confirmed it would hold an official ‘review’ of the spiralling costs of the controversial HS2 line, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor announced their backing for HS3.

They claim the line – which will link Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Hull – could boost the nation’s economy by cutting travel times between the cities by half.

But the Government was last night unable to say how much HS3 would cost – claiming it was ‘too early’ to put a figure on the project. 

They said detailed work on costs and timetable will be published by March.

However, the Chancellor has in the past speculated that such a line could cost as much as £6-7billion – leading to claims that further money was being wasted on what many believe is a misconceived and unaffordable project.

While northern council chiefs and business leaders welcomed the decision, furious rail protesters said the Government was ‘throwing good money after bad’.

It is estimated HS2 – a high-speed line linking from London to the Midlands and the North – could end up costing as much as £50billion.

And Stop HS2 campaign manager Joe Rukin said HS3 would be ‘even more expensive per mile than HS2’.

The Government says the new East-West HS3 line – connecting with the Y-shaped HS2 at Manchester in the West and Leeds in the East – will provide an engine of economic growth for the region and the UK as a whole.

Details of the plan were published last night in a report by Sir David Higgins called ‘Rebalancing Britain’.

It looked at how the second phase of HS2 high-speed rail project from London to the Midlands and the North could act as a ‘catalyst’ for regeneration in the North.

Journey times between Leeds and Manchester could be slashed in half from up to an hour to 26 minutes, while journeys between Leeds and Liverpool could be cut from nearly two hours to just one.

George Osborne previously hinted the cost of the project could be around £7billion. He is pictured with Sir David Higgins who compiled the report which detailed the new plans

New plans are also being drawn up to extend the original HS2 into Scotland, Sir David also reveals.

Mr Osborne said he was ‘delighted’ with Sir David’s report, adding: ‘Today we take another big step forward in delivering both the HS2 links from north to south and the HS3 link across the Pennines.’

Downing Street’s official statement announced a ‘green light’ for HS3.

At the same time Number 10 announced it was launching a ‘review’ of the costs and time-scales of all of the high-speed schemes.

Labour’s transport spokesman Mary Creagh, while supporting the schemes in principle, demanded ‘value for money for the taxpayer’.

Stop HS2’s Mr Rukin said: ‘If you want to help regenerate the North, you would spend the money there, and the very last thing you would do is make it quicker to get to London.’
