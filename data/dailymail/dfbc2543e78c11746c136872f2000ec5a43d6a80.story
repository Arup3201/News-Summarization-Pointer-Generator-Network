A meat-processing firm has breached legislation over the slaughtering of animals at its firm, it was revealed today - the fourth time in a year.

Triple J Family Farms in Buffalo Lake, Minnesota has been suspended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture over its practices involving the daily slaughter of 600 cattle.

The breaches involved the so-called 'knock box' - a pen where the cattle are stunned - and the killing floor where the stunned animals are bled to death.

The stunning is carried out with a bolt gun which is supposed to make the animals immune to pain.

The sanctions involved the piling up of cattle leading to animals being injured around the knockbox and the ineffective stunning of the animals. 

In the past year, 61 meat processing facilities in the U.S. have breached regulations, only two plants had three suspensions. 

The firm, which opened in 2012, brings cattle from all over Minnesota and the Dakotas to be slaughtered and caters to the beef kosher market.

Triple J is run by a Chicago meat distributor and an Iowa feed lot company, after they took over the closed North Star Beef plant in April 2012.

North Star was shut down four years ago due to excessive arsenic in its well water, according to startribune.com.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment today from Triple J on the suspensions.

The animal protection organization the Farm Sanctuary has condemned Triple J for its practices which the group alleges cause 'serious and significant animal suffering'.
