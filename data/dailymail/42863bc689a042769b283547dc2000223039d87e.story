This poor cat was left with a metal pellet embedded in her nose after being cruelly shot in the face by yobs.

Three-year-old Gypsy was rushed to the vet after owner Kayleigh Thomas spotted the projectile jammed between her nostrils.

The shaken pet was given painkillers before staff removed the pellet from her face.

Gypsy is now back at home in Newton Abbot, Devon, with Ms Thomas, who believes the shot was so precise that her pet must have been blasted from close range.

The mother-of-four, who had to pay an £85 vet bill, said: 'It took about half an hour. 

'The painkillers and injection made her sick afterwards.

'It was very difficult for her. She was quite poorly but she’s getting better now.

'The children were very upset. I just can’t believe anyone would do such a thing to a poor little creature. I was so disgusted that I was in tears.'

Ms Thomas has reported the incident to the RSPCA and is desperate to see the yobs responsible caught.

She added: 'It could even be someone who knows Gypsy because they must have beckoned her over to be able to grab her and hold her while the other one fired the air rifle.

'We've never had any incidents like this around here. The RSPCA have said they will prosecute if the offenders are caught.'
