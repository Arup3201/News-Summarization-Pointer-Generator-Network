Trouble: David Lea played extremely loud music at all hours of the day and night and has been evicted

A man who terrorised his neighbours and made life a misery for many in his street has been evicted by a city council.

Since David Lea, 45, moved into his flat on Mary Carpenter Place, Bristol, in 2011, the council has received numerous complaints.

Dubbing himself Dave 'Techno' Lea, he played extremely loud music at all hours of the day and night and on one occasion his tunes blared out for two whole days.

Bristol City Council said Lea used to have 'hundreds' of visitors calling at all hours and had no regard for other residents’ peace and quiet.

Bristol County Court heard Lea racially abused a woman neighbour and members of the multi-cultural community who live nearby and allowed his dog to run out of control around the small estate of about 70 flats.

His next-door neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Since he has gone, my life has changed and I am now very happy.'

Another neighbour added: 'It was so loud all the time. We could all hear it. We’re glad it’s finished now.'

Christopher Jones, the council’s anti-social behaviour case officer, said: 'Because of his appalling anti-social behaviour, we obtained an emergency injunction on April 13, 2012, to try and curb his behaviour, but within days of the injunction being granted, he breached it and was arrested.'

The courts were so appalled that they banned Lea from going within 100 metres of his flat.

But, on May 30, he breached that injunction by returning to the property, had a wild party and smashed up his flat and its contents.

The council said he has since disappeared and when a local newspaper reporter visited his former home yesterday, the door had been barricaded by the council with a metal door.

The county court notice attached said that Lea also owed the council £175 in costs.

Mr Jones said: 'Since he had totally refused to change his behaviour we applied for a possession order on his home and on July 10, 2012, District Judge Major granted the city council a seven-day outright possession order.

'This has now been executed and Mr Lea has been evicted. Residents of Mary Carpenter Place are now enjoying the peaceful surroundings and living without the fear of intimidation, loud music and abuse perpetrated by David Lea.'

Another neighbour of Mr Lea, who did not want to be named, said: 'He was clearly not very well and excess alcohol was possibly a factor in his behaviour.

'Basically, the council got him that flat and they should have known what he was like before he came here.'

The resident of more than a decade added: 'It’s a lot quieter neighbourhood now and he did upset the apple cart a bit, but he is obviously in need of help. He was a problem, but he is a great example of what the council move onto council estates.'

The council declined to comment on the neighbour’s view of the case.
