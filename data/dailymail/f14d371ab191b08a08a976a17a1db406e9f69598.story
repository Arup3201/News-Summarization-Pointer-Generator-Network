Child killer Jon Venables tried to seduce a mother-of-one over the internet by sending her flattering messages, she has revealed.

Sarah Finn, 36, unknowingly exchanged dozens of online messages and texts with James Bulger’s killer.

They would chat about rock music, festivals and partying and Venables confessed he loved the Pirates of the Caribbean films and the rock band, Muse.

He sent flattering messages and texts to her and tried to persuade her to meet up with him but Miss Finn, who has a 10-year-old son, never accepted his invitations.

Eventually their internet relationship collapsed after Venables sent her a photograph of his genitals.

Miss Finn said she was astonished and shocked when she was told she had been in communication with a child killer.

She said: ‘It’s chilling to think our relationship could have gone further and I may possibly have introduced him to my son who was ten - the same age he was when he killed James.

‘I had moved to a new area and was looking for friendship and possibly love. He nearly became mine, and that terrified me.’

Venables and his friend Robert Thompson were only ten when they abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James Bulger in Bootle, Merseyside in 1993.

They were released in 2001 and were both given a new identities.

They are protected by an injunction granting them lifelong anonymity for fear of revenge attacks.

Miss Finn, who had recently moved to North England with her son, formed the internet relationship with Venables after she accepted his friend request on MySpace in March 2007.

The mother-of-one described him as ‘good looking, charming, kind and easy to talk to.’

She found that they shared a love for rock music, festivals and partying and began chatting regularly on MSN Messenger.

They became friends on Facebook, swapped phone numbers and would occasionally chat using a webcam.

Miss Finn admitted she enjoyed their messaging and that they would have intimate conversations and text each other ‘quite a lot’.

She said he would often compliment her appearance and they would talk about going on nights out together.

She says Venables, now 30, kept asking to meet up with her but he suggested areas she was unfamiliar with, which deterred her from going.

She said: ‘He seemed like a sound guy. I remember him telling me he loved the film Pirates of the Caribbean.

‘He would say he was ‘sad’ because he was such a fan of Muse he’d seen them about ten times.

‘He flattered me a lot and said I was pretty. We talked about going on nights out together.

‘We got to know each other and talked intimately. And he would text quite a lot. Sometimes he would be flirty — sometimes not.’

But she admitted there were a few alarm bells and Venables appeared to be saying things which weren’t believable.

Recalling a night in May 2007 when the pair spoke via webcam, she said ‘He looked off his face on drink or drugs. He didn’t look normal. Then he fell asleep.’

Miss Finn eased off on their online relationship after Venables’ messages became increasingly sexual, culminating in him sending her a photograph of his penis.

In 2008 his messages stopped completely and his Facebook profile and MySpace snaps were deleted.

In 2010 it emerged that Venables was back behind bars for breaking conditions of his release with offences involving more than 100 sex abuse photos, some of children as young as two.

Miss Finn discovered her admirer was the infamous child killer when a woman linked to a true crime enthusiast contacted her - assuming she knew who he was.

She said: ‘I was horrified I’d got so close to him. It’s terrifying to think you could be dating a murderer I still dread to think what might have happened if I had met him.’

An image, uploaded to Twitter, last month allegedly showed Jon Venables at a birthday party after his 2001 release with a new identity.

The picture purporting to be of Venables was re-tweeted by more than 100 users and although it was swiftly taken down, it may have been viewed by thousands.

Venables has served his child pornography sentence and a parole hearing is scheduled to take place within the next couple of months.

James Bulger’s father, Ralph, said: ‘Venables always was and remains a very sick and manipulative individual. This is a perfect example of how dangerous he still is. Thank God this woman and her child had a lucky escape.’

Last month was the 20th anniversary of the death of toddler James Bulger.
