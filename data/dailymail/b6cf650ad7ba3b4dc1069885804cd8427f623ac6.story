A news reader was left embarrassed after a clip of her warning viewers that she is 'going to sound like a drunk' during a late night bulletin was aired by mistake.

A technical glitch meant that viewers of the Canberra news show were shown Kerryn Johnston uttering a throw away line pretending to be drunk after stumbling over her words during a rehearsal.

Instead of hearing the expected professional greeting from the presenter once the opening credits had rolled, Ms Johnston was heard to say: 'Good evening, tonight I'm going to sound like a drunk.'

Gaffe: Ms Johnston made the joke that she was going to read the news 'like a drunk' during a screen test

After her tongue-in-cheek greeting, Ms Johnston looked down at her script and requested a different camera angle in what was intended to be a screen test.

Producers of WIN News issued an apology after the error, with the channel's director of news, Stewart Richmond saying that Ms Johnston's high standards made the gaffe all the more difficult for her.

He said in a statement: 'This is a newsreader who sets a very high standard for herself.

'To have it go to air when it was not intended to, has been more than embarrassing for her.

'Kerryn has been presenting news for over two decades and has never put a foot wrong. Iâ€™m sure our viewers will understand.'

Embarrassed: Bosses at WN News issued an apology over the error

The error was aired during a midnight re-run of an earlier 6.30pm bulletin.

Miss Johnston only begun presenting nightly WIN Canberra bulletin at the beginning of July.

She has presented the show since filming was moved from the network's Canberra studio to Wollongong in New South Wales as part of cost cutting measures.

When the network made the changes, bosses vowed that the cutbacks would not affect the quality of broadcasts.
