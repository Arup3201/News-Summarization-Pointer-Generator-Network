Not many of us would have welcomed a wet start to 2013 after the year we’ve just had.

And it seems the problems caused by flooding are spreading... even seals are confused.

This creature swam 50 miles from the sea to a flooded field via the mouth of the swollen Great Ouse in the Wash.

Adventure: The seal has stunned nature experts by finding its way into a land-locked lake 50 miles from the coast after swimming through floods

Good effort: The seal is believed to have swum up the Great River Ouse, from King's Lynn, in Norfolk

Remarkable journey: The route the seal is believed to have taken to find itself 50 miles inland

It was seen heaving itself over flood defences which surround the Fen Drayton Lakes Reserve, near St Ives, Cambridgeshire.

Footage of its progress was posted on 
video sharing website YouTube with a caption that read: ‘The fields 
around the lakes have flooded, as they annually do.

‘In the river is a seal that is 
climbing up the flood defences to get into the field, now a mere, with 
swollen water from the lake inside.'

Wildlife workers said seals were 
occasionally spotted in the River Ouse but this seal made it ten miles 
further than previous sightings.

Graham Elliott of the RSPB, which runs
the reserve, said: ‘It would be the first time this has happened to my 
knowledge – that a seal has made its way into the lake.

Strength of character: The creature pulls itself up as it makes a bid to get into the water-logged field

‘It would be tremendous if one is there. It would be extremely unusual and it would become an attraction to visitors.’

In a fitting end to the wettest year on record in England, 86 flood warnings and 134 flood alerts were in place last night.

Around 540 properties have been 
flooded since December 19, including 20 in Burton Fleming, East 
Yorkshire, which has been under water since Christmas Eve, despite five 
powerful pumps operating around the village.

Squally winds and flooding caused more tragedies yesterday, after a 41-year-old man was swept out to sea by gales in Blackpool.

A search began shortly after midnight on New Year’s Eve when a man he was with raised the alarm.

It continued throughout the day but coastguards said it was ‘highly unlikely’ he had survived.

It is thought the man was walking his dog at high tide but ignored warning signs and was picked up by a 30ft wave.

Crews spent more than four hours searching for him but the operation was hampered by gale-force winds.

Paul Parton, from the Blackpool Royal 
National Lifeboat Institute, said: ‘Conditions were very difficult. It 
would have been a miracle if anyone managed to survive.’

Hotel worker Nadia Taylor, 20, said 
rescuers spotted a man in the water but he disappeared under the 
gigantic waves seconds later.

She added: ‘We had just sung Auld Lang Syne when the sirens started outside.

‘The lifeboats did a tremendous job launching in waves like that.’

Dennis Smith, 66, from Scotland, who 
had been at New Year’s celebrations in a nearby hotel described the 
dramatic rescue efforts.

He said: ‘When the seas were lit up 
you realised it was like a cauldron out there.’

Meanwhile a teenage 
party-goer survived after falling into a flooded river on his way home 
at 2am this morning.

The 18-year-old fell into the River 
Cynon at Hirwaun, South Wales, but hung on to a tree trunk for two hours
until he was rescued by firefighters.

Flood warnings were still in place along parts of the River Severn as Ironbridge, near Telford, was partially under water.

Flood barriers remained in place yesterday when the river was expected to peak.

It will come as welcome relief then 
that forecasters said there would be some respite from the wet and windy
weather over the next few days, with temperatures hitting 14C (57F) in 
some places.

The rest of the month is also expected to be considerably drier than the end to 2012.

Rachel Vince, of MeteoGroup, said: ‘We’ve turned the corner. What we’ll see over the next few days is fairly settled.

‘Notably, is it is going to be mild 
for January, with daytime temperatures between 12-14C (54-57F) and 
nighttime temperatures sometimes not dropping below 10C (50F). That is 
3-4C (37-39F) above average.

‘The picture for the weekend is that mild temperatures will continue.’
