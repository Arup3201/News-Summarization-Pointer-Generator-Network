For a club defined by its offensive flair and imagination, Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United look to have ran out of ideas in the final third.

They had to rely on defensive midfielder Daley Blind to rescue a stoppage-time point at West Ham on Sunday after another lethargic attacking display.

So what is going wrong up top for United? Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at their four frontmen…

Radamel Falcao (15 Premier League apps, four goals, three assists)

The chances of United signing Falcao on a permanent basis are now about as slim as the Colombian embarking on a scoring streak.

For the numbers just do not add up; age, transfer fee, salary and goals.

It will cost United £50million to sign a four-goal 28-year-old on wages north of £150,000 a week. That makes about as much sense as some of Van Gaal’s team selections and tactics.

Goals aside, even, Falcao’s overall contribution has been disappointing and he is averaging just one shot per game. Where is that devastating striker who smashed a hat-trick past Chelsea in the colours of Atletico Madrid in the European Super Cup of 2012?

He’s certainly not at Old Trafford. For injury has undoubtedly diminished his powers.

Falcao seems at odds with himself, unable to impact in the manner he once could. Gone is the swagger which made him the most coveted striker in Europe.

There is a disconnect with team-mates, too, a failure to strike any sort of understanding with those around him.

With 15 league appearances he cannot blame a lack of opportunity, either. The only saving grace for United is the ‘try before you buy’ nature of his loan deal from Monaco.

At this rate, they’ve had a try, and they won’t be buying.

Robin van Persie (22 apps, nine goals, two assists)

Look at a season-by-season record of Van Persie’s time in England. His career very evidently peaks in 2012, the year which straddles 30 Premier League goals for Arsenal and 26 for United, the latter of which won Sir Alex Ferguson a farewell title.

Those two years apart, his best returns read; 18, 12, 11, 11, 9. The point is this: Van Persie is by no means a guaranteed source of goals, primarily because his fitness record hasn’t allowed him to be.

On his day, of course, he was the best. But therein lies the problem, his best days are behind him. Even at the relatively young age of 31, Van Persie is a fading force.

Perhaps his team-mates have not aided his cause this season or last, but Van Persie has not bailed them out of trouble, either.

He has one goal – the opener in a comfortable 3-1 home victory over Leicester – in his last seven matches.

The ‘partnership’ with Falcao barely merits such description and the pair were again out of sync at Upton Park.

Even under mentor and compatriot Van Gaal, Van Persie’s body language betrays what appears to be frustration – be that with himself or the system.

Wayne Rooney (20 apps, eight goals, four assists)

The problem for Rooney, it seems, is that Van Gaal has made him something of a project, using the re-positioning of the captain to prove his skill as master manager.

Rooney, of course, has spoken positively of his new midfield berth, but what else would he say?

Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher was not happy with the deployment of Rooney during the draw at West Ham.

‘I was watching Wayne Rooney today and the position he’s in is not right,’ Carragher said.

‘Rooney has got to get back up front, that’s his best position, or, in this system, you’d want him behind the front two.’

The numbers support Carragher’s concern. From 11 midfield outings he has scored just three times and is now without a goal in his last eight matches.

In attack, his record reads far more favourably – five goals from nine games.

Given Rooney’s nature and thirst for goals and glory, it won’t be long before frustration kicks in, and that in turn will unsettle the team.

If Rooney is United’s best striker – and the numbers would suggest he is – then that is where he should play.

Van Gaal’s persistence with his midfield experiment is counter-productive, to the team and the individual.

James Wilson (11 apps, one goal, no assists)

Talent clearly resides within the 19-year-old and his involvement, in some sense, must be applauded.

But is it too soon? Should he not be on loan in the Championship - scoring goals and chasing promotion in much the same manner as Chelsea’s Patrick Bamford at Middlesbrough.

While he is bright and purposeful and undoubtedly gaining invaluable experience with every minute, a return of one league goal has done little to convince he is ready for the senior stage at United.

What he does inject, however, is an energy all too absent when Falcao and Van Persie are paired. But does that not say more about United’s offensive struggles that a rookie frontman is at times a better bet than the those senior stars?

Wilson could well mature into United’s next No9 and there is a raw enthusiasm about him which has its part to play amid their current toil. But to rely on the teenager would be asking too much. Rather, his comrades need to step up.

Overall this campaign Wilson has scored twice in 15 appearances in all competitions for United
