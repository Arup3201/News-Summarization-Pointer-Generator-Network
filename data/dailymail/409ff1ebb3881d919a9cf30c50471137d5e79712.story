Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew believes English football does not have enough black managers and coaches – and wants the ‘jobs for the boys’ culture out of the game.

Palace face Queens Park Rangers in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off at Selhurst Park and their manager Chris Ramsey is the only ethnic minority boss in the Barclays Premier League.

Pardew wants clubs to work on encouraging ethnic minority coaches to reflect the huge variety of cultures that players in England come from, rather than employing the same “boys club” members.

Chris Ramsey, QPR boss, is the only black coach in the top flight - and one of just six in the Football League

Ramsey is one of just six black or ethnic minorities bosses in the Football League, along with Huddersfield Town boss Chris Powell, Brighton’s Chris Hughton, Carlisle manager Keith Curle, Leyton Orient boss Fabio Liverani and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink with Burton Albion.

‘He (Ramsey) is black, which I think is great for the Premier League,’ Pardew said. ‘It’s something that I want to promote here in terms of our coaches, because the percentage of players we have to percentage of coaches in terms of origin isn’t right.’

Palace employ just ‘three or four’ black coaches, according to Pardew and in future recruitment he plans to change that, while backing the idea of a ‘Rooney Rule’ as seen in American Football where a black coach is considered for every job.

‘I’m going to keep approaching when vacancies come up and make sure that we are covering every kind of opportunity in terms of applications that come in,’ he said. ‘It isn’t “jobs for the boys” here anymore, I’m not saying it was, but sometimes it does go like that.

‘I think something like that (the Rooney Rule) could be looked at. I also know the LMA and the PFA are really trying to encourage a more diverse approach to getting different creeds to come into the coaching world and I just want to take this opportunity to back that up.

Pardew also looked to push forward the prospects of more Asian footballers coming into the game after signing South Korean winger Lee Chung-yong from Bolton Wanderers in the January transfer window.

And Pardew says Palace, based in the ethnically diverse area of South Norwood outside London, owe it to their surroundings to be more culturally diverse.

‘I don’t want to talk just about Afro-Caribbean coaches either,’ he said. ‘We have an Asian player now in our first team. We don’t have a lot of that and that’s another area that we need to promote, Asian footballers in this area because there’s a lot of huge community here.

‘We need a greater influx of Indians, Afro-Caribbeans, entering our coaching system and getting jobs, so the proportions make sense.’
