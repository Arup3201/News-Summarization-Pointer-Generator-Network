Paul Wilson (pictured), 38, suffered anaphylactic shock after eating a curry and was found dead at the pub where he worked

The owner of a string of award-winning Indian takeaways has been charged with manslaughter after a pub landlord with a severe peanut allergy  died after eating a curry.

Paul Wilson, 38, suffered an anaphylactic shock after eating food from the The Indian Garden in Easingwold, North Yorkshire. 

The takeaway's owner, Mohammed Khalique Zaman, has been charged  of manslaughter by gross negligence - the first case of its kind in Britain.

The 52-year-old, who runs the Indian Garden restaurant in Easingwold, North Yorkshire, will appear before Northallerton magistrates tomorrow. 

Father-of-one Mr Wilson, who had a six-year-old son, bought the curry in January last year and collapsed and died in his bathroom in the Oak Tree pub in Helperby, near Thirsk.

His death came months before the introduction of new laws demanding that all food businesses provide allergy information on unpackaged foods like takeaways.

All though allergies to foods like nuts are increasing, Mr Wilson's death is one of around ten each year in Britain.

His case has led to a major purge by trading standards officers targeting a food fraud in which peanuts are used in place of more costly almonds.

Most curry lovers are unable to taste the difference unless they suffer from a nut allergy - in which case the results can be fatal. 

Mohammed Khalique Zaman, 52, from York, has also been charged with perverting the course justice and an employment offence under the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

He has run takeaways and restaurants across  North Yorkshire for decades and his Jaipur Spice chain won best in the count in 2012 and 2013 at the Bangladeshi Catering Association Awards. 

Mr Wilson, from Sheffield, died in January 2014 at the Oak Tree Inn in the village of Helperby.

The Sheffield born bar manager was found unresponsive in the living quarters of the Oak Tree Inn, in the village of Helperby, North Yorkshire, where he was working, the spokesman added.

Police originally arrested two men - Zaman and an unknown 38-year-old employee - in connection with the death but the younger man was released without charge.

Mohammed Khalique Zaman, 52, who runs the Indian Garden restaurant in Easingwold, North Yorkshire, will appear before Northallerton magistrates tomorrow.

Paul Horsman, the manager of The York pub in Easingwold was one of the last people to see Mr Wilson alive.

The pair would often stop for a drink at pub on his days off. The night before he died Mr Wilson was waiting for a taxi to take him home with the curry at the pub.

Mr Horsman, who has run the pub for 26 years, said: 'It was a shock to find out someone I was talking to 12 hours before had died.' 

In 2011 another Indian restaurant, the Spice Lounge in Norfolk, had to pay £6,000 in fines and costs after a diner was rushed to hospital after she suffered a serious allergic reaction to milk in her curry - having already warned it made her ill. 

Last year a landscape gardener with a nut allergy died after eating a curry.

Derek Stephenson was eating his chicken tikka while watching the X Factor then he started coughing uncontrollably and his lips turned blue.

He told friend Stephanie Hodgson: 'S***, I'm allergic to nuts' before he collapsed and died. 

Nuts can trigger some of the most severe allergic reactions, although it's not clear why

Nut allergy is the most common type of severe food allergy.

It it is an umbrella term for an allergy to both peanuts (which, strictly speaking, are not nuts but legumes, belonging to the same family as peas and beans) and tree nuts, such as walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, cashews, pecans, brazils and pistachios.

Like many other foods, nuts can act as allergens, but for reasons that aren't clear, they cause some of the most severe reactions.

In the UK, about 1 in 100 people have an allergy to peanuts and about 1 in 200 people have an allergy to tree nuts. The number of people with peanut allergy is growing.

People who have other allergic conditions in their family - such as hay fever, asthma and eczema - are more likely to suffer nut allergy. 

Most people with nut allergy react after contact with small amounts (less than one nut) and some people may react to trace amounts, the website patient.co.uk reports. 

This means some people don't even have to eat an actual nut to have a reaction.

A minority of people are so sensitive to nut allergens that a tiny amount on their lips - or even standing next to someone eating peanuts - can trigger a reaction.

When someone comes into contact with something they are allergic to (an allergen), a group of cells in the body - mast cells - release a substance called histamine.

Histamine causes the tiny blood vessels in the tissues of the body to leak fluid, which in turn causes the tissues to swell. 

This results in a number of different symptoms.

Signs of a mild allergic reaction include: 

* Tingling mouth and lips

* Facial swelling and/or a feeling of tightness around the throat 

* Feeling sick, stomach pains 

* A rash or hives 

Signs of a severe reaction include (in addition to the above):

* Wheezing or difficulty breathing due to an asthma-like attack, or throat swelling 

* Fast heart rate - or low blood pressure which can cause fainting or collapse 

* Redness of the skin, due to dilation of the blood vessels  

A severe reaction is known as anaphylaxis.  Without immediate treatment, victims soon become unconscious.

A small number die every year due to this type of severe reaction, typically because they do not receive treatment quickly enough.
