Gordon Ramsay faces a £10.8million bill for rent over the next 17 years after losing a High Court battle over one of his London restaurants.

The celebrity chef will have to find a further £1.6million in legal fees and outstanding rental payments for the gastropub at the centre of the row.

Ramsay’s personal ‘kitchen nightmare’ stems from a bitter dispute with his estranged father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson, who was chief executive of his businesses until he was forced out in 2010.

Hearing: Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has lost his High Court battle over being held personally liable for the rent on a London pub he bought. He's pictured with wife Tana after giving evidence

Ramsay, 48, accused Hutcheson of using a ‘ghost writer’ machine to put his signature – without his consent – on a 25-year contract for the York and Albany pub near Regent’s Park in north London.

Such machines are often used by authors, celebrities and even royalty to sign books, papers and photographs automatically.

But Chancery Division judge Mr Justice Morgan yesterday poured scorn on Ramsay’s claim that he had been duped over the agreement to guarantee the pub’s £640,000 annual rent.

In a scathing judgment, Mr Justice Morgan dismissed as ‘entirely implausible’ Ramsay’s assertion that he did not know the full extent of the use of the signature machine. 

He added: ‘Accordingly, I find that Mr Ramsay knew, long before the entry into the agreement for lease and the lease of the [York & Albany] premises, that the machine was routinely used to place his signature on legal documents.

‘I do not accept his evidence to the contrary. 

'I find that when Mr Hutcheson committed Mr Ramsay to the guarantee in the lease of the premises, Mr Hutcheson was acting within the wide general authority conferred on him by Mr Ramsay at all times until Mr Hutcheson’s dismissal in October 2010.

‘Mr Ramsay may now regret the transaction in relation to the premises. 

'He may particularly regret his involvement as a guarantor. 

'He may consider that Mr Hutcheson did a bad deal.

‘However, on any finding, he is not able to say that Mr Hutcheson exceeded his authority in any respect.

' Mr Ramsay – acting through his agent Mr Hutcheson – is bound by the guarantee in the lease of the premises.’ 

At the time of the deal in 2007 Mr Hutcheson was very much at the helm of Gordon Ramsay Holdings. 

He left in 2010 after an acrimonious split with the chef who accused him of plundering £1million from his firm.

Last year actor and film director Gary Love – who owns the York and Albany premises – had described the chef’s High Court challenge as an ‘absurd’ attempt to wriggle out of his rental commitments.

Ramsay’s businesses won a bidding war to secure the 160-year-old building in the exclusive Regent’s Park area. 

The chef – who has starred in a number of TV food programmes including Hell’s Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares – has since turned the historic pub into an upmarket restaurant, bar and hotel.

When giving evidence at the court last November Ramsay’s wife Tana claimed both her father and brother Adam had been ‘systematically defrauding’ her celebrity husband.

She also told how she remembered the ‘shock on Gordon’s face’ when the couple’s solicitor told them that the lease for the York & Albany included a personal guarantee from him for 25 years.

The chef can still ask the Court of Appeal to hear his case – a path which sources close to Ramsay say he may be considering.

His legal bill is estimated at around £750,000 while Mr Love is now expected to claim around £600,000 in outstanding rent. 

In addition, the judge ordered him to make an interim payment to Mr Love of £250,000 within 28 days. The chef’s personal fortune is understood to be around £80million.

Last night Ramsay’s spokesman said: ‘We are obviously disappointed but do not regret bringing this issue to court. We are now reviewing the options available to us.’
