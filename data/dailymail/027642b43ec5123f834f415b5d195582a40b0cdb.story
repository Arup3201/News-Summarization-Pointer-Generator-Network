Disgraced MP Mike Hancock (pictured) has resigned his membership of the Liberal Democrats

Disgraced MP Mike Hancock has resigned his membership of the Liberal Democrats, the party has confirmed.

The move came after the veteran Portsmouth South MP, who had already been suspended by the party, was forced publicly to apologise to a vulnerable woman constituent for making improper sexual advances.

In June Mr Hancock gave an 'unreserved' apology at London's High Court over an 'inappropriate and unprofessional friendship' with a single mother known as Annie, who had sought his assistance as her MP and local councillor.

Solicitors for the woman said the apology was part of a 'confidential settlement' in which the 'vulnerable woman', who suffers from mental health problems, brought a claim for damages against him.

A Lib Dem spokesman said Mr Hancock had quit before an internal party disciplinary hearing.

Lib Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg had previously called on Mr Hancock to resign his membership and said he had 'no future' in the party.

A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'I can confirm he has resigned from the party.

'We have received a letter confirming his resignation. Obviously, there was due to be a disciplinary hearing imminently, so before that has happened he has resigned.'

Donna Jones, the Conservative leader of Portsmouth City Council, called for Mr Hancock, who failed to hold his seat as a councillor in this year's local elections, to also stand down from his seat in Parliament.

She said: 'Yet again this is another example of Mike Hancock jumping literally seconds before he is pushed.

'Nick Clegg had suspended him from the Liberal Democrat Party and removed the whip back in 2013 with an agreement there would be a review of his membership and before that happened, he has resigned from the party, so I am not surprised at all.

'Mike has had a long career in Parliament, in excess of 40 years, it's very sad his parliamentary career has ended the way it has but it was only a matter of time that his past has caught up with him in the form of this alleged sexual assault by a woman he came in contact with through Portsmouth City Council and it is a very sad indictment of his parliamentary career and now it's time for him to stand down.'

The 68-year-old had repeatedly denied the allegations by the single mother during her four-year fight to obtain an apology. But as part of a High Court settlement earlier this year he apologised unreservedly for any distress. 

In a statement read at the High Court, Mr Hancock said: ‘In October 2009 you first came to me as a constituent to seek my assistance as your MP and councillor.

'Subsequently and over several months I came to your home on several occasions, sometimes unannounced and conducted a friendship that was inappropriate and unprofessional.

‘I understand that you felt degraded. I did not treat you with sufficient respect. I made you feel deeply uncomfortable and discriminated against and I crossed the line. 

'As a political representative, there is a significant power differential with any constituent seeking help and particularly with your vulnerability of which I was aware.

‘You had a right to trust me. Everyone should feel safe and should be able to have confidence in their political representatives and I am sorry I made you feel otherwise. I have learnt from my mistakes and pledge not to act in the same way again.’

He added: ‘I also recognise that hurtful and untrue statements were made publicly about your motivation in bringing the claim. These statements sought to discredit and undermine you.

‘This should never have happened. I accept that you did not bring the claim for financial gain and any statements to the contrary were wrong.’

The 39-year-old woman had attempted to complain about Mr Hancock’s behaviour through the police, the office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, as well as the Liberal Democrat party and Portsmouth City Council, but her solicitor  said she had been ‘blocked from achieving a remedy at each stage’.

■ In 2011, a Russian woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four-year affair with Hancock while she worked as his researcher. Ekaterina Zatuliveter (right) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she targeted the MP as part of a ‘honeytrap’ operation. During her time working with Hancock, she even moved into his London flat.

■ Earlier that year, Hancock admitted having a ‘close and affectionate relationship’ with a 17-year-old girl. The pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience. ‘It was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual,’ he said. ‘There was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that.’

■ In 2010 it was claimed that Hancock had helped another Russian woman, 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, to stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the Nineties. Miss Paderina’s ex-husband said the MP went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office. 

■ Hancock was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the Eighties and Nineties. The marriage of Liz McCann, a Lib Dem councillor and a mother of three, broke up as a result of their relationship. ‘I had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party,’ she said. 

Hancock was also said to have had a six-year affair with Daphne Sparshatt, his constituency secretary. She told a newspaper: ‘He’s no great looker, he’s not God’s gift to women, but he charms his way in.’

■ There have also been allegations that Hancock had a relationship with Daniela Aura Dobre, 20, whom he met during an aid trip to a village near Bucharest in October 1990. She claimed: ‘We were very close. I miss him very much. 

'He’s a kind and charming man. He came on many trips, first in October 1990, then Christmas that year, then in January, March and April or May. I saw him each time.’

She said after the apology: ‘I am pleased that there has finally been a resolution to what has been a long and hurtful ordeal for me. Since the incidents about which I complained happened back in 2010, my physical and mental health have suffered and I am grateful that I may now have some closure to this traumatic episode in the lives of both myself and my son.’

The woman first met Mr Hancock in October 2009 at his constituency office in Southsea, after seeking help to deal with noisy neighbours.

A year later, he was arrested after she complained to a carer about his alleged sexual advances. He was never charged after police found there was no case to answer.

In March 2011, the woman complained about Mr Hancock to senior Lib Dem officials at the party’s Westminster headquarters, but no action was taken against him.

In a letter to Mr Clegg’s office in February last year, she said Mr Hancock had exposed himself to her, made numerous unwanted sexual advances and forcibly kissed her, but he was still not disciplined. 

Portsmouth City Council did ask Nigel Pascoe QC to investigate the allegations. But his report was never published and the Lib Dem-controlled council voted to keep it under wraps.

In his conclusions, Mr Pascoe wrote: ‘Making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of AH, I have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by Mr Hancock.’

Mr Hancock was suspended from the Lib Dems in January after the case became public.
