Pep Guardiola is one of the most successful managers of recent years and perhaps now we've found out one of the reasons why.

The Bayern Munich boss is renowned for being an astute tactician who encourages possession football, but he gave us a glimpse of his intensity in training during an open session on Tuesday.

The former Barcelona manager, who led Bayern to the Bundesliga title in his first season at the club, was filmed manhandling Thomas Muller and shouting instructions to his players as they prepared to face Schalke this weekend.

Hands on: The Bayern boss pushes Muller lightly in the chest during an open training session

No getting away: Muller turns his back on Guardiola but the Spaniard pursues him

In the clip, Guardiola can be seen having a heated discussion with striker Claudio Pizarro before turning his attention to World Cup winner Muller.

The 43-year-old pushes his forward in the chest before grabbing his arm and putting both hands around the back of his neck and shoulders, all while shouting out instructions.

Muller takes his manager's physicality in his stride and immediately prepares himself to take part in another drill as hundreds of fans look on.

Bayern began the new season with a narrow 2-1 home win against Wolfsburg last weekend and it appears Guardiola was less than impressed with his side's performance.
