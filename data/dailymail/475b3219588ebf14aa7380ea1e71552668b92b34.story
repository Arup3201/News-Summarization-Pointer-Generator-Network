A spokesmen for Ikea said: 'Considering the finding that 18 per cent of British children have an imaginary friend it’s unsurprising that we are using social media to bring our imaginations to life.'

Carol McSeveney, Children’s IKEA Manager in the UK, said: 'It’s clear that we are a nation of big kids who love our soft-toys; taking them everywhere we go, with over half of us still clinging on to them well into adulthood.'

The company has brought out a range of soft toys to raise money for UNICEF and Save the Children.

Since 2003, Ikea's Soft Toy Campaign has raised over £47million in a bid to help children living in poverty access an education.
