The Duchess of Cornwall helped to make the Christmas of a terminally-ill toddler an extra special one today by inviting her to decorate the Christmas tree at Clarence House.

Lorna Gentry, who is two and half, is suffering from an incurable brain tumour and has been given just months to live, her unspeakably brave parents revealed.

But the pretty youngster, wearing her best party dress, raced around the antique-filled drawing room of the Prince of Wales's official London residence with the energy of your typical, determined toddler.

Camilla, in a cream dress and pearls, helped Lorna, who was accompanied by her parents, Helene and Adam, to place a brightly-coloured ornament on the Christmas tree in the Morning Room.

Afterwards she gave her a bag of treats from the Buckingham Palace shop, including a Welsh Guards tree ornament and a Union, and posed for a personal photograph.

'Hello Lorna, I do love your pretty dress,' the Duchess said. 'Have a look at all these lovely goodies I have for you here.'

Lorna was born a perfectly healthy baby but seven months ago doctors diagnosed her with a brain tumour after her parents noticed she was experiencing mobility problems.

She has since undergone major surgery twice but has, tragically, been given just months to live and is currently receiving palliative care.

The toddler has also had a tracheotomy to help her breathe and is fed through a pipe in her stomach.

Remarkably, however, she had taken it all in her tiny stride and has even managed to learn sign language to compensate for losing her voice.

Indeed, when the obviously moved Duchess sank to her knees and handed over a goodie bag today she immediately signed the word  ‘thank you’ without any prompting from her parents.

Her father, Adam Gentry, from Banbury, Oxfordshire, said: ‘As parents having a baby you never imagine yourself being in this position. It is devastating.

‘We thought something might be wrong as she was experiencing problems with her neck and holding her head but never expected this.

‘You may say we are brave, but what do you? She is our daughter. ‘The biggest relief for us was when she woke up from surgery first time around and she recognised us.

‘As the surgery has rendered her mute we have been teaching her sign language and she can very much communicate with us.

‘Sadly the doctors have told us that it is probably going to be months and she is receiving palliative care. We are just making the most of every minute.’

Lorna was one 12 youngsters with 
life-limiting conditions, all of whom receive help from Helen and 
Douglas House in Oxford, which provides respite support and end of life 
care, invited to Clarence House.

Among
 them was Maya Czerminsha, five, who suffers from the muscle wasting 
disease muscular atrophy, who was wearing a tiara in honour of the 
occasion.

‘Well we have a real little princess 
here,’ said Camilla, ‘you look absolutely beautiful. And I just love 
your dress. I am so pleased you could come.’

The
 youngsters were given another treat as the Duchess’s assistant equerry,
 Lieutenant Frederick Lloyd George, great great grandson of the former 
Liberal Prime Minister and an officer in the Welsh Guards, saluted the 
youngsters and allowed them to try on his bearskin.

He also placed a bauble on the tree with his sword as the children watched spellbound.

Camilla, then invited the youngsters in for a slap-up lunch of sandwiches, crisps, sausages and biscuits.

Tom Hill, chief executive of Helen and Douglas House, said of the event: ‘It’s a fabulous opportunity for the families to create some very special memories. ‘Imagine how wonderful it must be for them for share photographs and stories of an event like this with the grandparents around the dinner table at Christmas.

‘It will also create some very special memories of their children once they longer here.

‘The Duchess is a huge champion of Helen and Douglas House and we cannot thank her enough.’

The Duchess of Cornwall became Patron of Helen and Douglas House in 2007 and since then children from the hospice have been invited to decorate her Christmas tree every year.
