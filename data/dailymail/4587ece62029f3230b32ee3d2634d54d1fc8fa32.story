Samuel Eto'o resurrected his 'old man' celebration after scoring for Cameroon against Germany on Sunday night as the two countries prepared for the World Cup.

The 33-year-old striker nipped in ahead of defender Mats Hummels to poke the ball past Germany goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on the hour mark.

Eto'o, who was forced to rubbish claims he is nearing the end of his career after Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho questioned his age earlier in the season, raced towards the corner flag to celebrate.

The former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker gave the Indomitable Lions the lead before Germany equalised just minutes later as Thomas Muller headed home Jerome Boateng's cross.

The hosts then took the lead as Chelsea's Andre Schurrle converted Arsenal frontman Lukas Podolski's square ball from close range.

However, the lead lasted just seven minutes as Cameroon frontman Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting - who plays his club football for Mainz and was born in Hamburg - hit a perfectly-executed left-foot shot into the corner of the net to draw Volker Finke's side level.

Germany played without goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, captain Philipp Lahm and midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, who are all nursing injuries.

Left back Erik Durm made his debut, with another defender, Marcel Schmelzer, also injured.

Germany have drawn their last two matches, with an under-strength side held 0-0 by Poland last month. The Germans also play Armenia on June 6, the day before they leave for Brazil.Â 

'It would have been good if we had used our early chances. We seem to need a lot of chances to score, that has been evident in recent months,' said manager Joachim Low.
