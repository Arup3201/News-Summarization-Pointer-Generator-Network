Russian prosecutors are studying a horrific video showing a train driver deliberately running over a bear while shouting 'squash him'.

The sickening 20 second-long footage, which has gone viral on the Internet, appears to show the animal running away from the engine down a stretch of railway track in Siberia.

But instead of slowing down and stopping, the driver speeds up and excitedly shouts expletives before seeming to enjoy the moment of impact.

Running away: The sickening 20 second-long footage, which has gone viral on the Internet, appears to show the animal running away from the engine down a stretch of railway track in Siberia

'Squash him! But rather than slow down for the animal, a voice in the train cabin says 'squash him!' Moments later, the bear disappears under the train

The Siberian Times reported that two male voices can be heard in the cabin, with one saying 'squash him' and the other adding 'f***ing squash him'.

The video attracted the attention of transport officials in Siberia after it was found online, and it is certain to anger conservationists around the world.

It is unclear what happened to the animal, as no body has been found and no traces of blood were found on the track, on the outskirts of Norilsk, an industrial city 1,800 miles from Moscow.

Officials with the Norilsk Transport Prosecutors Office say the incident took place at about 2am on December 4, near the Golikovo checkpoint.

The single stretch of track is only operated by the Norilsk Nickel Mining and Metallurgical Company, which is the world's leading producer of nickel and palladium.

Oksana Gorbunova, a senior aide for the Prosecutors Office, told the Siberian Times: 'We watched the video and it gave the impression that the train brigade deliberately sped up and didn't try to avoid the collision.

'We began an investigation - and not because we feel sorry for the bear - as first and foremost we have to investigate the actions of the train crew.'

Police have yet to find the animal so there are hopes that it somehow managed to escape at the last second.

However it is more likely it limped away injured and will be found dead in the coming days.

The Govorit Moskva radio station yesterday reported the bear is still alive, albeit quoting the head of the Moscow-based mining company's press service Petr Likholitov.

Mr Likholitov said: 'We got in touch with our colleagues in Norilsk. They said the animal was alive.

'They said that the front spade on the engine used to clean up snow simply lifted the bear and threw it to the side of the railway.

'Patrols found no traces of blood, so most likely the animal didn't get any serious traumas.'

Earlier reports from the local media suggest it is the same bear that residents have spotted around the city, in Krasnoyarsk Krai region of Siberia.

Normally bears hibernate at this time of the year but one has been seen a number of times, with armed police patrolling parts of the city.

Many parts of the Urals and west Siberia have faced a growing problem with bears in recent years, with increased incidents of people being attacked as the animals seek food.

Mr Likholitov added that the train drivers 'violated their code of conduct as they should have stopped the train'.
