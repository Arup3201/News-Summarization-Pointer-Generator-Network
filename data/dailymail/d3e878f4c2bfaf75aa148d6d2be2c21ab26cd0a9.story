New fears have emerged over 'death-trap' Beko appliances after a fire caused by a faulty tumble dryer destroyed a family's home.

The devastating blaze left Lorraine and Brent Ward and their two children homeless and they were forced to live in a single hotel room for four weeks.

The couple bought the tumble dryer to cope with extra laundry after their second daughter Lacey was born in November last year, a sister to seven-year-old Molly.

Devastating: The damage left by the flames at the Ward's rented bungalow in Tamworth, Staffordshire

Overheated: Beko had issued a product recall but the couple had not idea about potentially lethal problem

But the appliance overheated and burst into flames at their rented home, a two-bedroom bungalow, in Tamworth, Staffordshire, on January 13.

'Brent was screaming to get the kids out because the house was on fire,' said Mrs Ward, 34.

'It was just terrible. We got out, but lost everything we owned.

'Our insurance had run out while I was in hospital, but with so much going on I didn't remember to sort it out.

Product recall: Turkish company Beko makes a fifth of all white goods sold in Britain

'We lived in a hotel for four weeks, which was not easy with us all being in one room. Molly was going to school shattered because the baby kept waking for her feeds.

'We have found a new home but we are having to start from scratch.'

The couple received some help, including new toys for the children, but Mrs Ward said: 'A lot of the things we lost can't be replaced such as keepsakes, cards and photos.'

She added: 'It was the first time I have ever seen my husband cry – it was total devastation. 'I'm not sure how I have managed to hold it together.'

Beko, a Turkish brand that makes a fifth of all new white goods sold in Britain, knew about the tumble dryer fault and issued a product recall in November last year, but the couple had no idea about the potentially lethal problem.

The firm accepted responsibility for the fire but it is accused of putting thousands of consumers at risk by supplying products which may be faulty.

There are also concerns that it has been too slow to issue safety warnings and ensure that customers who own unsafe products are offered repairs.

The firm is at the centre of a £1.5million legal action by Jennifer Benjamin, whose husband died in a fire at their home in Wealdstone, North London. 

Beko has accepted responsibility for
the fire. It has passed the case to its insurers which has made the 
family a cash offer to cover the value of items lost in the fire.

To date, there has been no promise of any compensation for the stress and disruption to their lives.
A Beko spokesman said: ‘This specific 
case is presently being handled by our insurance company who have been 
in regular contact with Mrs Ward.

Homeless: The family's insurance ran out when Mrs Ward was in hospital to give birth to daughter Lacey

‘It is important to note that Beko stepped in after Mrs Ward’s landlord was about to make them homeless and covered hotel expenses near their child’s school for a period of time until they could be re-housed.’

He said the company issued a safety recall on the dryer which caused the fire in November last year and, so far, has modified 77per cent of the machines in homes.

‘We want to reassure our customers that most Beko models are not affected. However, any concerned customers can visit our website where there are clear instructions on how to check if their model is affected,’ he said.

‘The safety of all our products is Beko’s highest priority and we deeply regret any incident linked to one of our products.’
