Enner Valencia says West Ham are the talk of Ecuador now that he is a Hammer.

The striker was huge hit at the World Cup, scoring three goals for his country in Brazil which helped him secure a £12million move to the Premier League.

After playing 120 minutes in the Hammers' midweek Capital One Cup defeat by Sheffield United - and missing the decisive penalty - Valencia could now be in line to win his first start in England against Southampton on Saturday.

And it is a sight supporters in his native Ecuador will behold now that they have adopted West Ham as their new club.

'It's great to see that since joining West Ham, we now have fans in Ecuador who are West Ham fans,' said Valencia, after several of his fellow countrymen had queued up to meet him at a signing session earlier this week.

'We have great fans, it has been great to play in front of them so far and I am looking forward to doing this more during the season.

'But it is good to meet them personally and thank them for the welcome they have given me since I arrived at the club.

'I hope that they will join all our other supporters and follow the team.'

Fellow new boy Diafra Sakho, meanwhile, faces a fitness test ahead of Saturday's meeting with Ronald Koeman's side.

The £3.5million summer recruit is a doubt after tweaking his back during the Hammers' Capital One Cup exit, in which he opened his account for the east London club.

The Sengal forward faces a race to be fit in time or could join the Andy Carroll, Matt Jarvis, James Collins, Kevin Nolan and Carl Jenkinson on the sidelines for Sam Allardyce's men.

'I really love English football and I have dreamed about coming to play for one of the big English clubs,' said Sakho, speaking at the supporter event alongside Valencia.

'West Ham have given me that opportunity and I didn’t hesitate to grab it.'
