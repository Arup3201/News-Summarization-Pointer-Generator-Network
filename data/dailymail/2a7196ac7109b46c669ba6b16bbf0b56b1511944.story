A second bald eagle egg has hatched in a Pennsylvania nest on live-streaming video that thousands of people have watched.

The hatchling Wednesday morning came a day after the first eaglet arrived in a nest in York County's Codorus State Park.

A Pennsylvania Game Commission biologist tells the York Daily Record the sibling eagles will compete fiercely for food and could end up harming each other.

Statistics show only about half of hatched eagles ever leave the nest and siblicide - the killing of one chick by a relative - is common.

The eaglets won't be ready to fly on their own until late June or early July.

The game commission installed a live-streaming eagle cam focused on the nest in December. 

One egg was laid on Valentine's Day and the second, on February 17.

Apparently more than 640,000 people have watched the live stream, with many viewers checking in daily.
