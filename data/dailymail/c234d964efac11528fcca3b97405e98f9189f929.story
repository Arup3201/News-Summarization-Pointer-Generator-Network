A tiger snatched a woman and dragged her into an Indian forest in front of her husband.

The couple and a boat driver were trying to catch crabs in a shallow river in the state of West Bengal on Friday when the tiger pounced.

The animal dragged the woman into the thick mangrove undergrowth of the Pirkhali Forest - an area known for tiger attacks - as her husband looked on helplessly.

After he reported the attack, forest guards searched for the woman, but couldn't find any trace of her, forest official Nabin Chandra Bahunguna said.

The attack happened in the Sunderbans, India's vast and tangled mangrove forest where the Ganges River empties into the Bay of Bengal.

It was the sixth tiger attack this year in the Sunderbans, where environmentalists say shrinking habitat is forcing tigers to venture farther in search of food.

In June, a Bengal tiger dragged a man off a fishing boat in India and into a mangrove swamp as his children looked on in horror.

The family were also understood to be crab fishing in a stream in the Sunderbans National Park when the animal jumped aboard the boat and attacked the man.

India is home to more than half of the 3,200 tigers believed to be left in the wild in the world.

Their numbers are also dwindling fast because of deaths at the hands of poachers, who target the creatures for their skin, bones, teeth and claws.
