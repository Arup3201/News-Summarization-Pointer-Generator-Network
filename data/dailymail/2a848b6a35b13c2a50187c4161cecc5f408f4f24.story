One university student with a sweet tooth for doughnuts camped outside a Krispy Kreme store for four days ahead of the official opening.

Not only was he the first to set foot in the doors of the first Western Australian store, but Favian Lin took out the 'first in queue' prize to win a year's supply of doughnuts.

The global doughnut company and coffee house chain opened at Whitfords City, north-west of Perth on Wednesday morning.

Favian Lin took out the first prize to win a year's supply of doughnuts after camping for four days

The 19-year-old, from Hillarys, waited in line from 5pm on Sunday but his family and friends made sure he didn't forfeit his place and brought along supplies to keep him entertained.

'My friends came to visit and got me a stretcher bed and food and my mum even brought my laptop and some change of clothes for me,' Mr Lin told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It was quite exhausting waiting for so long but the store had a giant tent set up so I was undercover the whole time - so that was good.'

The unemployed marketing student said he was the only person who camped on Sunday but it started to pick up leading up to the opening.

'The idea was actually suggested by some friends and I thought I might as well do it because I had a lot of free time on my hands and who can refuse free doughnuts?' he said.

'There was another guy who waited on Sunday but he ended up leaving not long after but a lot of people started rocking up on Tuesday night.'

Mr Lin has been rewarded for his patience with a dozen doughnuts a week over the next 12 months, meaning if he doesn't share them out he will consume 156 grams of fat and 2616 calories every seven days.

'I don't regret the long wait - it was quite entertaining and I'm surprised myself that I won,' he said.

'I was actually quite shocked because I've never won anything before - especially in first place.'

Other prizes included a six-month supply of doughnuts to the second person in queue, three months supply to the third person and the first 100 customers got a 'special Krispy Kreme limited edition pack'.

The store is expecting to sell 5000 boxes per day, which means more than a tonne of icing sugar, half a tonne of casting sugar and 44 kilograms of strawberry jam will be used every 24 hours.

Security guards and traffic management have been operating in the area since Wednesday, as thousands are expected to rush through the doors throughout the day. 

It comes just months after the first store opened in South Australia but the Krispy Kreme opening got out of hand when the long queues caused fights between doughnut-mad customers.

Police were called to the outlet more than 20 times within the week of opening, after brawls between impatient customers  and two teenagers were robbed of their doughnuts at knifepoint.

And about 145 parking fines totalling $21,000 were issued to drivers who parked illegally, which also caused a traffic chaos in the area.
