It's almost eight months to the day since Liverpool and Everton last met and, like bickering siblings, the disagreements go on.

Liverpool won 4-0 at Anfield in January, which really should have ended all arguments before they began. This is Merseyside, though, and different rules apply.

As such, Everton’s Roberto Martinez has never accepted that result as a hiding while Brendan Rodgers of Liverpool also believes the scoreline wasn’t representative of what went on.

Roberto Martinez will not sacrifice his attacking principles against the Reds despite his side leaking goals 

Liverpool have lost their last two matches in the Premier League and sit in 11th position after a poor start

Everton have  won only once in the Premier League this season and are just a point above the drop zone

‘They were fortunate not to go away from the game losing seven or eight,’ said Rodgers rather pithily this week.

222: In 222 derbies, Liverpool have won 89, Everton 66, with 67 draws.

11: The highest-scoring match came in 1933, when Liverpool won 7-4 at Anfield.

13: The number of own goals in this fixture - three by Liverpool and 10 by Everton.

566: The number of Merseyside derby goals - Liverpool with 311 and Everton 255.

On the one hand it’s good to know these things still matter that much. It will be a sad day if they ever don’t. 

On the other hand, however, both clubs go into Saturday’s lunchtime fixture with broader things to ponder, namely rather indifferent starts to the  Premier League season and defensive records more suited to life at the bottom end of the table.

It could be argued that the only club from last season’s top end with anything like satisfactory form so far is Chelsea. From that point of view, Liverpool and Everton are not alone.

Daniel Sturridge also scored that night, and he is in line to make his return from injury against the Toffees 

As well as winning more of the derbies, Liverpool have spent a great deal more than  Everton in recent years

Nevertheless, it is odd to see both teams in the wrong half of the table with just three league wins between them. 

Everton have conceded 15 goals in five league games. The last time this happened was 20 years ago and manager Mike Walker was not offered the opportunity to stick around and redress the balance.

Liverpool conceded three at Manchester City, three at West Ham and have also thrown in a home defeat by Aston Villa. Martinez, at least, was prepared to admit this week that such risks come as a side-effect of the way he sets teams up to play.

‘I’m not going to hide anything,’ said the Everton manager. ‘I know there are managers who are from a school of wanting to win through keeping a clean sheet and having a team that’s difficult to beat with their main goalscoring threat coming from set-pieces.

Martin Keown believes Rodgers needs to rotate his squad better and Everton must focus on their defending 

‘I say this with respect, but I’m from a philosophy of always wanting to win through scoring goals and if that’s going to leave you open, you need to score more goals than the opposition.

‘That’s the top and bottom of it. That’s the only way you can be good enough to win titles and achieve more than people would expect from your team.

‘I feel as hurt losing 1-0 as losing 6-0 but, if you lose 6-3 trying and having a positive from the performance that helps you to take something into the next game, I’ll accept that.’

Contrary to what Martinez believes, it is possible to win titles on the back of clean sheets. Meanwhile, losing 6-3 — as Everton did at home to Chelsea in August — will get you nowhere apart from the opening slot on Match of the Day.

With Everton's defence leaking goals, Romelu Lukaku will need to perform if Martinez's side are to get a result

The Spaniard’s approach is clear, though, and we should not begrudge him that.

As for Rodgers, he refuses to accept that his own style of play is of the risk-and-reward type, even though Liverpool finished second last season while conceding more goals (50) than Crystal Palace, who finished 11th, and at least as many away (32) as all of the top 17 teams apart from Stoke and Sunderland.

This would appear to point to a problem, one perhaps exacerbated so far this season by an uncertain early contribution from summer signing Dejan Lovren.

Everton last celebrated a win at Anfield on September 27, 1999 - 15 years ago.

Kevin Campbell scored the only goal as red cards were shown to Everton’s Francis Jeffers and Liverpool’s Sander Westerveld and Steven Gerrard. 

Campbell  said: ‘The thing which surprised me was seeing so many Evertonians celebrating in the Kop!’ 

Gerrard recalled. ‘I had a gut-wrenching pain in my stomach after that.’

‘It is probably an easy assumption to make when coaches set up to play an attacking game,’ said Rodgers. ‘The way we set up, it is about having the balance. We look to impose our style on the game, but you always have to respect your opponent.’

All managers defend their teams and their tactics and Rodgers is no different. Looking at the two teams objectively, perhaps Martinez has more to worry about. His defence is pretty much the same as last year. Rodgers, at least, can point to the problems with bedding new players in.

Whatever the case, at Anfield  on Saturday the wider arguments don’t matter, only the result. Given the way football often works, this one will probably end up goalless.
