Two students have gone to extreme measures to avoid sitting their final exams by posting an ad online for a hitman.

The two females from the University of Georgia put the ad on Craigslist which reads: 'I am looking for someone to run my friend and I over with their car' reported local publication Flagpole.

'We do not want to die, we just want to be injured enough to get out of taking our finals here at UGA. Please do not kill.'

Two female University of Georgia students posted an ad on Craigslist earlier this week looking for someone to injure them in order to get them out of their final exams

The compensation in returned for the ad was described as 'hitting two lovely ladies by vehicle w/permission'.

The ad has now been flagged for removal by Craigslist.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the University of Georgia.

It is not the first time that the classifieds website has been used to seek out a hitman.

In March, a Hollywood skin specialist to the stars was accused of plotting to kill her main competitor in a 'murder-for-hire' scheme.

Dawn DaLuiseÂ  allegedly hired a former Detroit Lions player Chris Geile as a hit man to kill the competitor. He has not been arrested or charged and denies involvement.

The beauty therapist also allegedly made Craigslist postings inviting men to turn up unannounced at the home of rival Gabriel Suarez for 'trysts'.

The ad is believed to have been posted by senior students at the University of Georgia (pictured)
