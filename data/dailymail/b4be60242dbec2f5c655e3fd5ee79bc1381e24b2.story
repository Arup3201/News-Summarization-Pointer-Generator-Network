Rescuers have reached a second ship containing hundreds of migrants which was found drifting towards Italy in stormy seas with no crew on board having been abandoned by the smugglers.

An Icelandic coast guard ship, part of a new European patrol force to aid migrants at sea, made contact with the stricken vessel Ezadeen – thought to have 450 migrants on board – and has brought it under tow.

It comes as nearly 1,000 migrants were saved earlier this week when the coastguard boarded another ship sailing without a crew and stopped it from crashing into the coast of Italy.

Rescue: The Ezadeen, thought to have 450 migrants on board, is brought under tow by an Icelandic coast guard vessel working for the EU after it was abandoned by smugglers 

Conditions: After several hours of struggling in rough seas, rescue teams managed to secure the Ezadeen for towing toward the southern Calabrian region

Children and pregnant women were among the migrants, most of whom were believed to be Syrian, said Marini. 

Italian Coast Guard Cmdr. Filippo Marini said that after several hours of struggling in rough seas, rescue teams managed to secure the Ezadeen for towing toward the southern Calabrian region. 

The Sierra-Leone-flagged cargo ship apparently set sail from Turkey, he said.

The exact port of the Ezadeen's arrival will depend on sea conditions, authorities aid.

Earlier on Friday, Marini said that a migrant had called for help saying: 'we're without crew, we're heading toward the Italian coast and we have no one to steer.'

The Ezadeen is the second cargo ship full of migrants to be abandoned while still sailing this week.

Days earlier, the Italian Coast Guard in a daring attempt, lowered officials onto another, Moldovan-flagged cargo vessel so they could take control of the ship, which was only a few miles from crashing into the Italian coast. 

 More than 170,000 migrants were intercepted or needed rescue by Italian navy, coast guard and air force patrols last year. 

This apparently new technique by smugglers of abandoning a ship after setting it on a crash course complicates rescue efforts, Marini told Italian state radio, `'but the important thing is there are lives to be saved.'

The new high-seas drama came two days after Italian sailors intercepted a freighter carrying more than 700 mostly Syrian migrants was abandoned by the people smugglers who had navigated it from Turkey

The Italian Air Force was last night called in and sent a helicopter from an air base in southern Italy to help the 60 metre long Ezadeen, a ship sailing under the flag of Sierra Leone, which was spotted 40 miles off the south eastern top of Italy.

It was hoped the coastguard could be lowered down to secure the ship and doctors could also come aboard.

Prior to losing power, the ship had been moving at seven knots and had been spotted by a coastguard plane 80 miles offshore shortly after nightfall. 

The new high-seas drama comes just two days after Italian sailors intercepted a freighter carrying more than 700 mostly Syrian migrants which had been heading for the rocks of Italy's southeastern shore on autopilot, having been abandoned by the people smugglers who had navigated it from Turkey.

In that incident, the Moldovan-registered Blue Sky M cargo ship got to within five miles - or 45 minutes sailing time - of a disaster before six navy officers were lowered on to the ship by helicopter and succeeded in bringing it under control.

The vessel's human cargo included 60 children and two pregnant women, one of whom gave birth on board, according to the Italian Red Cross.

Many of the migrants on the ship were treated for hypothermia and broken limbs.

Italy has rescued more than 170,000  in the last 14 months - hundreds have died trying to make the crossing

The migrant boat dramas have come as Italy grapples with the aftermath of the Norman Atlantic ferry disaster in which at least 13 people died following an onboard fire that erupted before dawn on Sunday in waters off Albania.

They also come after a record year for people fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia attempting to reach Europe by sea.

More than 170,000 people have been rescued by Italy in the last 14 months and hundreds, possibly thousands, have died trying to make the crossing.

They are almost invariably under the control of ruthless traffickers who earn thousands of dollars for every person they put to sea from Libya and other departure points in North Africa.

Increasingly the traffickers get their human cargoes to Europe by putting them out to sea and then abandoning the boats.
