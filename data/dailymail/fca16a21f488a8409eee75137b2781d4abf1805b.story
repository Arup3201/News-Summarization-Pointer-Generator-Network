A former stripper from Philadelphia who traded dancing for dicing shocked everyone last night when she was named the latest winner of the FOX reality competition cooking program MasterChef. 

Courtney Lapresi, who originally hails from from Geneva, New York, walked away with $250,000 and a book deal after wowing judges Gordon Ramsay, Joe Bastianich and Graham Elliot with her meal of crispy pig's ear, sumac duck breast, and cherry meringue.

Most of the talk this season had less to do with the 25-year-old's talent however, and more to do with her exotic former job.

While getting her degree in dance at Philadelphia's University of the Arts, Lapresi worked at Delilah's, a popular gentlemen's club.

In fact, Lapresi also performed well in competition there, winning the club's Entertainer of the Year contest twice according to Philly.com.

When performing, she went by the name 'Winter.' 

And now, the girl who never went to culinary school has won big again, beating out fellow contestants Leslie Gilliams and Elizabeth Cauvel to take the top prize during last night's finale.
