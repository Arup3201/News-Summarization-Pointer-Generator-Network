Mike Watkinson has stepped down as Lancashire's cricket director.

Watkinson leaves the club in the wake of their relegation to the second division of the LV= County Championship, having spent 32 years with the Red Rose in various capacities.

The former England all-rounder, 53, both played for and captained Lancashire before becoming cricket manager in 2002 and, for the last five years, the county's cricket director.

Lancashire chairman Michael Cairns OBE added: 'I would like to place on record our sincere gratitude to Mike Watkinson for his long-term service of Lancashire County Cricket Club as player, captain, cricket manager and cricket director.

'On behalf of everybody connected with LCCC I would like to wish Mike well with his future endeavours.'
