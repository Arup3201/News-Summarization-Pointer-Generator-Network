A woman has gone on trial for allegedly shooting up a McDonald's after bacon was left off her burger twice in 24 hours.

Shaneka Monique Torres, 30, is accused of firing a 9mm handgun through the restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan in the early hours of February 9, 2014. No one was hurt in the incident.

She is on trial after refusing a plea deal and now faces up to seven behind bars if convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, shooting at a building and use of a firearm.

In court on Tuesday, her attorney John Beason said Torres did not mean to pull the trigger when she shot the drive-thru window after the server had gone out of view.

'She says she pulled the trigger, but she did not pull it on purpose,' Beason said, according to Mlive. 'Stupid? Yes. Mistake? Yes. Accident? Yes. Intentional? No.'

Torres had gone to McDonald's the previous day for a burger but was unhappy to find it did not have bacon on it, as she had requested, police said.

After speaking to the managers, they offered her a free bacon burger on her next visit, police said, and  after drinking at clubs with a friend that night, she took them up on their offer.

Sitting in the passenger seat, she headed to the drive-thru at 2am - stopping to chat up a manager at one of the windows before giving him her number, which later helped police track her down.

Scene: A news report from February 2014 shows the window Torres allegedly shot after getting a burger with no bacon inside. Her attorney said she shot the gun but did so accidentally

But when she and her friend received their order, she again had no bacon on her burger.

Torres pulled out a handgun and fired once, sending the bullet through the window and out the other side of the restaurant, police said.

Beason told the jury on Tuesday that the gun, which had no safety, went off accidentally.

Torres' friend, Nydia Ray, who was driving the car, told the court her friend had not been upset by the lack of bacon on her burger.

She said she saw the gun after handing the order back and was in the middle of saying 'What the f*** is going on?' when it fired.

The server, Essence Lake, had walked away from the window when she heard the shot and saw the hole in the glass, she said, adding the bullet would have struck her if she'd still been by the window. 

'We went back and forth screaming and yelling and then we pulled off,' Ray said. 

The women went to Ray's home but not before a witness wrote down the plate number. Police tracked the women down 30 minutes later.

Grand Rapids Police Officer Patrick Loeb said Ray told him that her friend had been upset over the order.

She told him Torres said something along the lines of 'do you know who you're talking to?' before she fired - which Ray has since denied.

The trial will resume on Wednesday.
