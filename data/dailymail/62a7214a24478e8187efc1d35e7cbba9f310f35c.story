A Queensland man fed up with his 'lemon' car has started an online campaign to raise funds to destroy it.

Ashton Wood has started a Kickstarter campaign to raise $22,500, the amount Chrysler offered to him to buyback the car, and allows those who donate the chance to be involved in the car's destruction.

For $12 supporters can have their name written in permanent marker on the car before it is smashed up, $22 will buy someone a go at the car with a sledge hammer, $250 will enable someone to destroy the engine and $5,000 grants someone the right to set fire to the Jeep at the end of the process.

Ashton Wood and his wife Ness have had 20 car problems, including four that required a tow truck, since they bought it in 2010

One of the most popular items so far is the chance to shoot the car with bow and arrow - a privilege that will set you back $55.

So far the campaign, Destroy My Jeep, has 39 backers who have pledged more than $1,600 between them

Mr Wood said he is taking extreme measures after years of frustration with his 'cursed' Jeep Cherokee, which in the four years since he bought it in 2010 has had all number of problems, including the fuel line falling off, coolant leaks, the rear strut leaking oil, ongoing ignition failure, and the turbo inlet manifold cracking.

'Things happen with cars, but you shouldn't have 20 things wrong with it, requiring four tow trucks and a push [when the car broke down before he even got it out of the showroom],' he told MailOnline.

Mr Wood insists he has never driven it off-road and that the car has only done 12,000km, a number disputed by Chrysler who say it has driven 30,000 to 40,000km.

Mr Wood said he 'tried everything possible the right way' to get a resolution from Chrysler, contacting the dealer, importer, Office of Fair Trading and the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal.

Mr Wood is hoping that people will pay for the fun of destroying his car, which he says is 'cursed' and a 'lemon'

Mr Wood said he wanted to shoot the Jeep with guns but that's illegal in Australia and so people will have to settle for bow and arrow assaults on the vehicle

The Destroy My Jeep project was started after Mr Wood felt he had exhausted all formal options of communication with Chrysler

Chrysler offered Mr Wood a settlement of $22,500 for the car, for which he originally paid $49,000, and he knows that if he sold the car himself he could get $28,000 for it, but he says he feels uncomfortable with both options.

'It's become a matter of principle for me, if I take their money, they're going to on-sell the car at a profit and someone's going to end up with my lemon and I just don't think that's right.

'I might as well try and find some lighter side to the whole thing.'

The Kickstarter campaign is a way of doing just that, as well as putting pressure on big companies who think they can bully unhappy customers into giving up, he said.

'I'm just really disappointed in their lack of want to resolve this issue and I certainly tried all the formal ways to resolve this.

'I guess in this day and age of social media it puts pressure on companies to do the right thing by their customers and I'm really hoping they review their policies.'

Mr Wood adds that he has 'never done anything like this before' and does not think all Jeeps are faulty.

'I don't think it's all Jeeps, it's just there's something systemically wrong with this one.'

Once the destruction of the Jeep has taken place, Mr Wood says he just wants to put this chapter behind him. He will have to buy a replacement car and while he is not certain which model he'll purchase he does know one thing.

'It won't be a Jeep.'
