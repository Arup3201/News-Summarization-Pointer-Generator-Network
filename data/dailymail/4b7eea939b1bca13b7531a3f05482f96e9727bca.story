A New York man has been curbed from committing an outrageous transgression: running in Central Park at 4:30am.

The jogger, self-described entrepreneur, author and worldwide connector Peter Shankman, was duly given a ticket as he and a running partner entered mile two of his scheduled 10-mile run on Thursday, training for an upcoming triathlon.

The NYPD officer who witnessed Shankman's early-morning workout informed him that 'the people's park' does not open until 6am and issued him with a summons.

Keen jogger: Peter Shankman flagrantly flouted the Central Park opening hours by jogging too early in the morning

'Note - Running in the park. Not "performing sex acts for crack," or "laying down explosive charges," but "running.‚Äù Because apparently, a 215 pound man running through Central Park at just over a 9:10 pace is a threat to Manhattan,' wrote Shankman on his Facebook page.

Shankman says he saw no signs or warnings at 63rd Street and Central Park West where he entered displaying the park's opening hours which, for any keen joggers, are 6am until 1am.

Dutiful: A dedicated police officer apprised Shankman of his misdemeanor and issued him with a ticket that could cost him $1,000

As a busy father, husband and jack-of-all-trades ('marketer, NASA adviser, TEDx speaker') Shankman says that if he didn't get his 10 miles in early, he'd never fit training in.

Shankman must now to go court in May to fight his ticket, and says he could be fined up to $1,000.

He suspects that the ticket was written to meet end-of-month quotas.

Running rage: Shankman will have to attend court in May to fight the summons

Have a laugh: Shankman has maintained his sense of humor, tweeting yesterday, 'It's almost 9am, and the good news is that I haven't been given a summons for anything so far this morning'

'A "hey, buddy, the park doesn't open until six, you need to run on the sidewalk outside" from the police officer wouldn't have sufficed?' he wrote on Facebook.

'Apparently not, since he made it clear that his boss was in the car with him, so he had to write me up.'

Shankman says he understands that the law is in place to prevent people staying in the park too late or sleeping on the benches, but that he entered early to work out.

'The last 12 years have really been about getting the city healthy, you know. No smoking in bars, no trans fats, and here I was, I was running, I was exercising, trying to lose a few more pounds before this race,' he told Pix 11.

'Thank god I wasn't holding a Big Gulp.'
