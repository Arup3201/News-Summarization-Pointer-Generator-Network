Romelu Lukaku said Everton are the favourites in their Europa League clash with Dynamo Kiev after winning their Europa League last 16 first leg 2-1.

The Belgian's penalty secured the win, with Steven Naismith having cancelled out Oleg Gusev's opener.

'Yeah, definitely,' Lukaku said when asked by ITV Sport if his side were favourites.

'It's going to be difficult over there.

'We are happy with the performance, we worked well after the first half and were unlucky to concede. We reacted well, kept going and could have scored three goals to be safe.

'We now focus on the league where we're not doing so well.'

Manager Roberto Martinez said: 'We started edgy and there was anxiety and we were cagey, but we were playing a good side.

'We scored a very good goal, and then you saw momentum carrying us through.

'This is very pleasing as we kept Dynamo very quiet. We are now looking forward to the second leg, we have travelled very well as the fans allow us to be ourselves.'
