The Duchess of Cornwall couldn't resist taking home a 'swag bag' made by burly prisoners - who have, remarkably, been taught the gentile art of needlework.

Camilla was browsing a pop up store at London's historic Fortnum and Mason in support of the lags' charity, Fine Cell Work, today.

Long one of the royal's favourite organisations, it trains prisoners to sew and pays them up to £500 per year for the products they produce, including exquisitely-made cushions, bags, tea cosies, quilts, and Christmas decorations.

Sense of humour: The Duchess laughs as she holds up her swag bag purchase

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are among those who have already received gifts made by Fine Cell Work prisoners, 97 per cent of whom are men and can be Category A and B inmates, among the most dangerous in the country.

Prince Charles and Camilla have also bought regularly from the charity since its prisoners made them a wedding gift - a needlework duck and badger - for their 2005 wedding.

One inmate at Wandsworth Prison took so much pride in making the royal gift he was nicknamed the Earl of Wandsworth by cell mates.

The prisoners also supply top design firms like Colefax and Fower, Stella McCartney, Conran and Ben Pentreath, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's interior designer.

Camilla immediately spotted a humorous bag stitched with SWAG which cost £39, a dachshund cushion for £150 and a couple of £10 pin cushions, which she paid for herself.

She admitted that her own sewing skills were hopeless but praised the charity for the quality of its work.

Who should I give this to? The royals are known for exchanging quirky gifts at Christmas

Keen eye for detail: The Duchess admired the skill that had gone into making the products which were created by offenders who are trained and supported by volunteers from the Embroiderers and Quilters Guild

Which should I buy? The Duchess was spoilt for choice

After the visit the Duchess had a quick snoop round the Piccadilly department store - founded in 1707 - browsing for other Christmas gifts.

Louisa Macfarlane, a volunteer from Hampshire, has worked with prisoners at Albany on the Isle of Wight for the past 12 years.

'We've got all the best ones,' she said fondly. 'It's a Who's Who of 20th century villainy.'

She spoke movingly of how teaching prisoners to stitch had changed their lives and given them something to take pride in, although she declined to name any of the more notorious prisoners she has worked with in those years.

Asked whether she ever felt in danger, she laughed: 'No, I have two boys of my own.'

She added: 'I see so many tragic stories, people whose lives could gone in any one of a number of directions but have never received the help and support they need.

Charity venture: The goods made by Fine Cell Work will be on sale at Fortnum & Mason

Stocking up: Dog lover Camilla also bought a Dachshund decorated cushion 

Handiwork: Camilla was amused and impressed by the swag bag, created by prisoners who stitch independently in their cells or take part in workshops

Workshop: Camilla watched demonstrations of some of the techniques taught to prisoners.

'We sit around the Ping Pong table or television room and sew together. It's quite remarkable when you see it. Like a little sewing bee.'

At any one time, the charity, which pays 37 per cent of the proceeds from its sales to the prisoners, works with 240 inmates around the country.

They spend an average 28 hours per week working on making the goods. If they earn more than £500 in a year, it is kept for them until their release so that the savings can help them stay crime-free.

Some have even gone on to work in interior and costume design on being released.

Camilla, loading up her shopping bag, confessed that needlework had never exactly been her strong point at school and there had been little improvement since. 'Don't get me started on that,' she joked.

Katye Emck, founding director of the charity, said they make a point of not discussing their prisoners' crimes. 'Sewing transcends that and we pass no judgement,' she said.

'What we do shows these men the virtue of work, how to take pride in what they do and give them a small income. Stitching is also remarkably emotionally therapeutic.'
