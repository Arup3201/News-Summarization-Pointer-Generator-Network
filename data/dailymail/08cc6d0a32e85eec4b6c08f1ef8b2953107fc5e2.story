It just goes to show that engraving jewellery is not just sentimental, but smart.

A California couple have been reunited with the wedding they lost two years ago - and it's all thanks to the message that was scrawled on the inside of the band.

And Facebook, of course.

Jenna Birchim was at Ellwood Beach in Ojai with her family when what she thought was a bottle cap that had washed up on the rocks was actually a ring.

The power of social media: It took just four days for Jenn Birchim to track down the owner of this ring after she posted it on her Facebook page

The ring was lost here, at Ellwood Beach in California, close to Santa Barbara, two years ago and found recently

As she inspected it, Birchim found an inscription that said 'My Love, My Life, My Lobster'.

She thought that meant it belonged to a fisherman, but either wat, it might be just be enough to try and find its rightful owner.

Birchim put a photo of the ring on Facebook, which was subsequently shared over 25,000 times.

One of the people that came across worked with a woman named Sarah Lindsay.

Sarah knew straight away the ring belonged to her husband, Greg, because it was her message engraved on it.

They had lost the band at the same beach two years prior.

'I thought it was somewhere in the Pacific,' Greg told KEYT.

'There's no way, I thought after losing it, there's no way it would come back on shore.'

Amazingly, the picture had only been on Facebook four days before Sarah Lindsay came across it.

This is the moment Jenny Birchim reunited Sarah and greg Lindsay with the lost wedding ring

Greg and Sarah Lindsay are expecting their first child together in August. They said it's 'unbelievable' to have found their lost wedding ring two founds after it was displaced

On Saturday, Birchim met with the Lindsays to give them back their ring.

'Totally resorted my faith in humanity,' Greg said.

'I was like wow, there are still honest good people out here like Jenn, to be able to do the right thing. So it was pretty cool.'

But hang on, what does 'My Lobster' mean?

Turns out it is a nickname Sarah and Greg have for each other, based on an episode of Friends.

In the show Phoebe explains that lobsters fall in love and mate for life, and Ross pronounced Rachel his lobster.
