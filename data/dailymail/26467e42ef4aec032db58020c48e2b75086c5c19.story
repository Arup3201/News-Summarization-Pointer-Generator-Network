A couple returning from France found two migrants stowed away in their trailer - next to a hot air balloon.

Chris and Claire Monk made the unusual discovery in the car park of Calais' Campanile Hotel as they returned from a summer offering ballooning tours in Tuscany.

They had checked their expansive trailer because of recent headlines over Calais' immigration crisis, but were still stunned to find two resigned-looking men in their late 20s crouched inside.

The men wandered off without protesting and Mr Monk, 52, spent the next 40 minutes combing over the contents of his trailer to make sure no one else had smuggled themselves inside.

He and his wife, a 46-year-old graphic designer, spoke out to warn other tourists after their return to their village of Coxley, Somerset.

'We checked because last year we came back and the immigration officers pulled us over and searched us,' he said.

'Then there was the publicity from truck drivers and the like, and my mum said: "Make sure you check your trailer!".

'It was still a shock. It was still dark and we had noticed the velcro on one of the compartments of the larger trailer wasn’t exactly sealed, and the corresponding fastening clips loose but still secure. You can imagine our surprise.

Plenty of room: The couple checked inside due to recent headlines - and they had been stopped before

'I just said: "Out - you two could have got me into a lot of trouble and cost me a lot of money".

'Their body language just implied they were going to try again with someone else the next day.' 

The couple found the men, who they said were of African origin, in the car park of the hotel at around 7am on Saturday, October 18.

Many car parks in Calais are secure, and although the Campanile's was not open to the street it had only a basic mesh fence and security gate.

Mr and Mrs Monk, who had been ballooning in northern Italy since May, could have been fined up to £2,000 and had their trailer seized if they had not spotted the pair and been stopped by officials.

They told the hotel about the incident but did not inform French police because, as Mr Monk put it: 'That wouldn't have achieved anything except making us miss our ferry'.

He added: 'I can see both sides - these people are running away from something awful. Once they're in Europe they've escaped what they're running from, so there should be a European-wide solution to help them.'

Yesterday Calais' mayor told MPs Britain was an ‘El Dorado’ for thousands of migrants because of generous handouts.

Blaming the UK for the crisis, Natacha Bouchart said benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for determined people.

She said the migrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, were ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain.

But Tory MP Lorraine Fullbrook hit back at the claims, telling Ms Bouchart: ‘You can’t expect us to disadvantage our people because France can’t police its borders.’
