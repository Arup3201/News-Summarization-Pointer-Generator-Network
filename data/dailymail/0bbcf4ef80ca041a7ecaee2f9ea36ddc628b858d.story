Former middleweight boxing champion Jermain Taylor was arrested on Friday following a shooting at his home in suburban Little Rock, Arkansas, according to a spokesman for the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office.

'Mr. Taylor was arrested for domestic battery, first-degree, and aggravated assault,' said sheriff's Lt. Carl Minden. 

'It was his cousin and another individual that came over to his house, an altercation ensued, he (Taylor) grabbed a weapon and opened fire.'

Taylor, 36, known to his fans by the nickname 'Bad Intentions,' was booked on battery and aggravated assault charges for shooting an unarmed person 

The cousin was hospitalised in a serious condition with an apparent gunshot wound. The other man, described as a friend of the cousin, was not injured, Minden said. 

The two drove away from the home and were found at a Dollar General discount store several blocks away, Minden said, after a woman believed to be Taylor's wife called 911 shortly before 6pm to report an intruder and a shooting at the home.

The names of the cousin and other man were not released.

Taylor, 36, was being held in the Pulaski County jail without bond early on Wednesday, according to online prison records. His attorney did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.

Minden said the nature of the altercation between the men was still under investigation, and that Taylor was arrested without incident.

'He was very calm and very cooperative with our investigators,' according to Minden.

Taylor is due in Pulaski County District Court on Wednesday for a hearing in the case, Minden said.

Taylor won the WBC, WBA and WBO middleweight titles in 2005-06, twice beating Bernard Hopkins.

 He lost his fight with British fighter Carl Froch at the Foxwoods Resort, Connecticut in 2009.
