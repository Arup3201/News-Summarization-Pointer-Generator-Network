It may look like an attacker from a 1980s computer game, but Nasa today revealed this photo taken by Hubble of a massive cluster of galaxies two billion light years from Earth is an optical illusion.

Called Abell 68, the object is really a 
mirage created by the gravitational field of a foreground cluster of 
galaxies warping space and distorting the background images of more 
distant galaxies.

This effect, called gravitational lensing, can make multiple mirror image copies of the light coming from a far-flung galaxy.

Abell 68, pictured here in infrared light, is a galaxy cluster. Hubble operators were stunned to see what looks like a space invader' character - but in reality the object is really a mirage

The image looks uncannily similar to the alien from the Space Invaders
computer game

'The gravitational field surrounding this massive cluster of galaxies, Abell 68, acts as a natural lens in space to brighten and magnify the light coming from very distant background galaxies,' said Nasa.

'Like a fun house mirror, lensing creates a fantasy landscape of arc-like images and mirror images of background galaxies.'

The foreground cluster is two billion light-years away, and the lensed images come from galaxies far behind it.

'In this photo, the image of a spiral galaxy at upper left has been stretched and mirrored into a shape similar to that of a simulated alien from the classic 1970s computer game Space Invaders!'

This image was taken in infrared light by Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3, and combined with near-infrared observations from Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys.

In this Hubble photo a background spiral galaxy is warped into an image that resembles a cartoon of a simulated space invader. The foreground massive cluster, called Abell 68, lies two billion light-years away. The brightened and stretched lensed images come from galaxies far behind it

'These distorted images of distant galaxies are a particularly fine example of this phenomenon,' said the European Space Agency.

'In the middle of the image are a large number of galaxies stretched out into almost straight streaks of light that look like shooting stars.

'Meanwhile, just above and to the right of the large, bright elliptical galaxy in the upper left of the image is a spiral galaxy whose apparent shape has been stretched and mirror-morphed into the shape of an alien from the classic 1970s computer game Space Invaders!

'A second, less distorted image of the same galaxy appears to the left of the elliptical galaxy.'
