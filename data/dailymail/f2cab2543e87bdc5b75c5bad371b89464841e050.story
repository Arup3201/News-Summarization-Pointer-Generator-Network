A woman fought off five hooded thieves and put one in a headlock to protect her blind husband who was watching television on the sofa. 

Marion Pedersen, 47, was watching TV with husband Andrew, 50, when the men broke into their sheltered accommodation home in Harborne, Birmingham. 

Fearing the gang were about to attack her husband, she launched herself off the sofa and attacked the group.

She wrestled one of the gang to the group and grabbed him in a headlock, before shouting for help.

But the thief wriggled free and, along with the rest of the gang, fled - having left the couple's flat ransacked.

They made off with the couple's laptop, a mobile phone and a purse containing a small amount of cash and credit cards.

Ms Pedersen, a mother of one, was treated at the scene by paramedics following the incident at 12.10am on Thursday and suffered a fractured rib.

She said: 'One minute we were watching TV and the next thing we knew these men were in the room, running amok searching for things to steal.

'We are on the ground floor and they broke their way in through the back door.

'I was petrified and initially felt frozen to my chair, but then I thought one of them was going to do something to Andrew.

'Instinct just came over me, I don't know if I was being brave or just stupid.

'I got one of the thieves in a headlock and dragged him down to the floor.

'I pulled back his hooded top as I wanted to get a good look at the face of someone who could do something so heartless.

'But then he pushed me off him and I felt my rib go and I started screaming. That's when they ran off.

'I haven't attacked anyone before but when one of them was going towards my husband I saw red.'

Fearing the gang were about to attack her husband, she launched herself off the sofa and attacked them 

Her husband, who used to work as a hospital porter before he went blind 16 years ago, added: 'I heard people coming in and my wife was screaming "get out".

'Apparently four of them went to the table and one came towards me.

'Marion saw red and got him in a headlock and knocked him to the floor.

'It was amazing, it scared them off. She is my hero.'

The couple, who have been married for three years but together for 26, have only lived at the sheltered accommodation for a year. 

Ms Pedersen said her husband had now lost his 'lifeline' as relatives entertained him with the laptop that was stolen, while he sits through three four-hour sessions of dialysis every week.

She added: 'I am sickened that anyone can break into someone's home, particularly when they know it is sheltered accommodation for vulnerable, disabled and old people.

'I'm worried sick that they will come back and have another go.

'I want them to be punished and I want to prevent anyone else from having this happen to them.'

She described the thieves as Asian, aged between 18 and 20, and of a slim build.   

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'Police have launched an investigation after a break-in at an address in Elm Tree Road, Harborne, just after midnight on Thursday August 28.

'The occupant challenged the five offenders and was pushed to the floor.

'They made off with a laptop, a mobile phone and bank cards.'
