Floyd Mayweather has his ex-lover calling him a monster and suing him for plenty of his hard-earned millions.

He has a rapper who used to be his friend and business partner trying to humiliate him with false accusations that he is illiterate.

He has the dangerous duo of Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan jostling at the head of the queue to be his opponents next year in what he insists will be the last two fill-your-bank-accounts fights of his career.

Mister Money also believes that whenever he enters the ring the opposite corner is occupied by not only the latest challenger to his status as the best-for-pound fighter in the universe but also a host of boxing fans and critics praying for him to lose his cherished unbeaten record.

Then he has all those high-powered cars to keep polished, all the jewel-encrusted watches to wind, his kids to take out to Fatburger and his promotions company to expand into what he expects to become the biggest in the hardest game.

Meanwhile he has a million or more pay-per-view subscriptions to sell for this Saturday’s Las Vegas rematch with Marcos Maidana, the macho Argentinian who dragged him into his most rugged brawl of recent years.

At 37, there should be times when he feels like he’s going on 65.

Yet he looks fresher than the daisies which spring up the Nevada desert the morning after it rains here. And he lasts a lot longer.

Those flowers wilt within hours under the sun but Mayweather keeps a spring in his step.

Not only that but he does not appear to have a care in the world.

This is not only the highest-paid but probably the most single-minded of athletes.

Ms Shantel Jackson alleges – among other un-pleasantries endured between being showered with gifts like a $2.5million 17-carat diamond – that Mayweather held a gun to her head, imprisoned her in his bling-laden home and berated her with foul-mouthed insults in public.

Mayweather shrugs off Ms Jackson’s law-suit and Mr 50 Cent’s ‘tragic’ slur on his education as ‘just circus stuff to which I pay no attention.’

As it happens there is always the smell of greasepaint around his fights, which intentional or otherwise keeps selling the tickets at a rate which earns him around $40m a time.

This enterprise also demands that he focusses his mind away from all the hassle of his garish life.

‘Nothing ever distracts me from a fight,’ he says. ‘Nothing.’

Not even the prospect of being jailed, which he was for a previous conviction for assault and battery of a previous lady partner.

Certainly not now that he can see the giant safe at the end of the prize-ring’s tunnel of pain.

One final year of submitting to his own constantly repeated mantra – ‘hard work, dedication’ - should bring in another $150m. At least double that if he agrees to meet Pacquiao in one – or even both – those climactic fights next May and September.

For the moment, the Money Man is denying the assertion of the PacMan camp that they are in ‘serious negotiations’ to finally make the super-fight which the world has been waiting an eternity to see.

‘I can’t say what comes after Maidana,’ he reiterates. ‘I never allow any distractions from my next opponent.’

Since Maidana roughed him up in the MGM Grand for several rounds before becoming his 46th victim four months ago, that absolute concentration on the job at hand is probably advisable.

Not that many here expect him to have as much trouble second-time around.

Khan, who may be at ringside as he keeps up his pursuit of a fight with Mayweather before the great man retires, expects Maidana to be ‘chasing shadows on Saturday night.’

Britain’s two-time world champion – who awaits confirmation of an opponent for an interim fight in the US on December 6 - holds firm to the belief that ‘my speed is the one element which can give Floyd more problems than he has had of late.’

The waiting game goes on for Khan and Pacquiao, who defends his version of the world welterweight title against Chris Algieri in Macau next month.

The show goes on for Mayweather, circus or not.

Mayweather v Maidana will be live late this Saturday night on BoxNation.
