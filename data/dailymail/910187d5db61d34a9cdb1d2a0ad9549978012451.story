On the evening of August 26, 2013, a group of English cricketers walked on to The Oval pitch and sat together in the gathering twilight. They had won the series and retained the Ashes, now they drank champagne in celebration of their triumph. Then something extraordinary happened. A number of players climbed to their feet and, one by one, proceeded to urinate on the wicket, while colleagues cheered in laddish approval.

Over in the Press Box, a few Australian cricket writers were putting the last, sombre touches to their Test match reports. They looked up, realised what was happening out in the middle and gleefully began a whole new story.

The incident was scarcely earth-shattering, indeed, there were those who excused it as no more than ‘high spirits’. Yet it was undeniably crass and arrogantly disrespectful and, for some, it crystallised lurking misgivings about the England side. They were richly talented, hugely successful but too often they lacked the style, the class, the charm we seek in the best of our sportsmen. As such, they were widely celebrated but sadly unloved.

Victory usually writes its own cheque with the English public. We can think of any number of unappealing figures who became national treasures simply by beating Australia at cricket. But never has a team of proven winners attracted so many reservations among those who were desperate to celebrate their achievements.

Of course, there was a nucleus of quietly impressive individuals. The successive captains, Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook, spring swiftly to mind, as do the likes of Ian Bell and poor Jonathan Trott. But others seemed rather less engaging. There was Graeme Swann, a fine spinner, desperate to be recognised as a ‘character’. Swann, or ‘Swanny’, as he much prefers to be called, deserted Test cricket when England were 3-0 down in an Ashes series in Australia. There was Swann’s chippy chum Matt Prior, whose wearisome barking was a discordant sound of an English summer. And there was Stuart Broad, a notably preening, pouting presence in a team which had its share of preening pouters.

Which leads us, quite naturally, to Kevin Pietersen. One imagines that the past few days have been some of the happiest of his life. In recent months, he has been obliged to rely on the efforts of minor showbiz mediocrities to keep his name in the headlines. But now everybody, but everybody, has been talking about him! And all it took was one spectacularly dreadful book.

Boorish, vindictive, petulant, insufferably conceited and remorselessly self-justifying, Pietersen’s autobiography is a study in paranoia. Jealousy is everywhere, resentment is rampant, the world is conspiring to do down KP. But will KP be done down? He will not. And all of those enemies and ingrates, from Strauss to Andy Flower, to most of the England bowlers, to all of the cricket media; well, now they know that KP is not a man to cross.

Pietersen has spent the week shamelessly self-promoting his dreadful new book

His lack of awareness is astonishing. Last week, speaking to the Today programme on Radio Four, he was asked if there was anything he might have done differently. ‘Absolutely’, he said. ‘I think my biggest single flaw is that I’m too honest, too much of a straight talker.’

It was gauche beyond parody. A man with even a shred of self-awareness could not have uttered that line. Yet Pietersen had clearly rehearsed it.

In truth, the entire interview was studded with unconscious gems, but the following passage rang a familiar bell: ‘When I did get sacked, a lot of the youngsters who are in the team at the moment sent me messages saying, “I’m really sorry. Thank you so much for all your help”. I get messages when the team are playing against India saying, “How am I going to play this guy? What should I do in this situation?”.’

Then I recalled these words of another wickedly maligned titan: ‘You’ve seen how I react to people, make them feel good, make them think that anything’s possible. And I don’t do it so they turn round and go, “Thank you David for the opportunity, thank you for the wisdom, thank you for the laughs”. I do it so, one day, someone will go, “There goes David Brent. I must remember to thank him”.’

Pietersen had to pack his bags in February, when he was sacked by the ECB

Brent and KP have a good deal in common. Like Pietersen, Brent would have shaken off the dust of counties and nations with scarcely a second thought. Like Pietersen, he would have cast himself as perpetual victim. And, like Pietersen, he would have listened only to courtiers and sycophants while ignoring sane, intelligent men of cricket who were offering more prudent counsel.

And yet, we must curse the wanton waste. At a time when England face an impossibly crowded year of international cricket, a great player has placed himself beyond the pale. The bloom of Pietersen’s glittering talent has faded but he surely had more runs to plunder, more service to offer. No longer. He has gone and he will not be back.

And how will posterity remember him? I suspect Pietersen will be seen in the same light as the team he once adorned: richly talented, hugely successful and widely celebrated. But sadly unloved.
