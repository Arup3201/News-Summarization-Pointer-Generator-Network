A 33-year-old woman gave birth to a baby girl on a flight bound to New York from Jordan.

A spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says a nurse and doctor on the flight helped deliver the baby.

Vera Jaber, a 32-year-old Jordanian, gave birth to the 6-pound, 5-ounce girl with nearly three hours left to fly before arriving at JFK airport, said Port Authority Spokesman Joe Pentangelo.

Above the Atlantic: A woman aboard Jordanian Royal Airlines gave birth to a baby girl nearly three hours before landing at JFK airport  Tuesday evening

The birth happened over the Atlantic aboard Royal Jordanian Flight J261 at around 5 p.m. Tuesday.

Mother and baby were taken to Jamaica Hospital in Queens after the aircraft landed at John F. Kennedy Airport around 7:30 p.m.

Both appeared in good health though it was unclear how far along Jaber was in her pregnancy.

Pentangelo says the woman is a citizen of Jordan and was traveling alone. 

This isn't the first time a woman has given birth aboard a flight in recent months.

Just this past December, a Southwest Airlines flight from San Francisco to Phoenix had to make an emergency landing after a woman went into a labor and gave birth to a baby just minutes after takeoff.

The flight was diverted to Los Angeles International Airport after the heavily pregnant mother began having contractions at 10,000 feet.

An emergency room nurse and a doctor who happened to be aboard the flight delivered the child - with the help of a very rattled flight attendant.

There were 111 people aboard the plane at the time. 

The woman, 32-year-old Vera Jaber, had been traveling alone. She and her little girl were rushed to Jamaica Hospital in Queens around 8pm. Both were said to be doing fine
