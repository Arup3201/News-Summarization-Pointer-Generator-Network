The charred remains of a father and his two children were found in a garage yesterday just hours before he was due at a custody hearing opposite his ex-wife.

Jocelyn Marcoux, 47, is thought to have killed son Lindsey Brillant-Marcoux, 13, and daughter Karen Brillant-Marcoux, nine, before taking his own life at the family home in Warwick, Quebec, in the early hours of yesterday morning.

Just hours earlier, Mr Marcoux took to his Facebook page to post a lengthy, angry email denouncing the Quebec family court system for 'favouring' mothers over fathers.

Scorched: Firefighters work to put out the blaze in the early hours of Tuesday morning

Battle: About 20 firemen fought the blaze in the garage, which was about 20 metres behind the house, for 45 minutes

Writing in French, he said: 'I swore 
in my heart as a father that my children would never children be 
mistreated again, not even with the blessing of a hypocrite judge...

'For fathers, it's official - if you don't take justice into your own hands, you'll never have justice.'

Nadine
Brillant, the children's mother, wrote on her own Facebook page in a 
post that was later deleted: 'My ex has killed my children. I am 
crushed.'

Ms
Brillant had earlier posted that she heard about a fire on the street 
where her children lived with her ex-husband while watching the local 
news on television.

She said she hoped they were safe, before adding she feared the worst as police were on their way to visit her, reports MontrealGazette.com.

When
firefighters arrived at the scene shortly before 3am, flames were 
leaping 15ft into the air, according to Warwick fire chief Bernard 
Beaudet.

About 20 firemen fought the blaze in the garage, which was about 20 metres behind the house, for about 45 minutes.

Mr Beaudet said his team later found three bodies next to four tanks of propane gas and that Mr Marcoux's car was in the driveway.

He told TheStar.com: 'It was very tough. To arrive and find three people dead, itâ€™s tough.'

A police spokesman confirmed that the bodies belonged to an adult and two children.

The bodies are so badly burned that formal identification will take days, he said.

Mr Marcoux, who is thought to have been an electrician, and Ms Brillant separated in 2002 in what was initially an amicable split.

But the last few years saw their custody fight grow increasingly bitter.

They were due to attend a custody hearing at a court in Quebec City yesterday morning.

Numerous messages of condolence have appeared on Mr Marcoux's Facebook page.

One, written by Nicole Poirier, said: 'Rest in peace, you and your two loves who you cherished more than anything in the world.'
