Britain's two biggest airports were busier than ever in 2014.

Heathrow passenger numbers last year rose 1.4 per cent to a record 73.4 million, while a total of 38.1 million were handled at Gatwick - a 7.6 per cent increase on 2013 and another all-time high.

The Heathrow numbers were boosted by a record final month of the year which saw nearly six million passengers pass through the west London airport, which was a rise of 2.4 per cent on the December 2013 figure.

Heathrow Airport passenger numbers were up for 2014 - to a whopping 73.4million, an all-time high

Gatwick's December figure of 2.58 million was 8 per cent up on the same month in 2013.

And when it comes to most popular destinations, Latin America has seen a spike in interest.

Heathrow's full-year total included a 6.3 per cent rise in Latin America traffic, with East Asia up 5.2 per cent and Middle East and Central Asia up 3.5 per cent.

In December alone, Heathrow saw over 6 million passengers come through - a 2.4% increase on 2013

At Gatwick, there was a 2.8 per cent growth in North America traffic, while other long-haul destinations grew 12.1 per cent.

Bosses of both airports seized on the figures to support their case for being recommended by the Government-appointed Airports Commission this summer to be the site of a new runway.

Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: 'Only by expanding Heathrow can we add direct flights to the world's growing cities, increase our exports and connect all of the UK to global growth.

'Expanding Heathrow will help Britain win the race for growth.'

Not to be outdone, Gatwick also had a record-breaking year, serving 38.1million passengers

Gatwick chief financial officer Nick Dunn said: 'Our record-breaking figures show an airport serving the widest range of travel and airline models - exactly what is needed from the decision about the UK's next runway.'

London's third-busiest airport - Stansted in Essex - also had a good 2014, with passenger numbers rising 12 per cent to more than 19.9 million.

This was Stansted's best year since 2008 and was rounded off by December 2014 passenger levels of more than 1.5 million, an 18.5 per cent increase on the December 2013 figure.
