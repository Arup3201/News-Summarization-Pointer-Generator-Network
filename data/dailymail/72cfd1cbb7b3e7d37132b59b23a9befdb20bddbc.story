This is the scene at Wimbledon just weeks after Andy Murray clinched the Wimbledon men's singles title on the famous grass of Centre Court.

The grass has disappeared as groundsmen at the SW19 club strip the courts to resow them.

The team, led by head groundsman Neil Stubley, are tasked with the arduous job of keeping the lawns at the All England Club in perfect condition.

Barren wasteland: The crowds have disappeared from Wimbledon - and so has the grass

Groundsmen use specialist Koro machinery to strip away the grass and prepare the soil for the new seed

Every inch of the courts is painstakingly tended to by a team led by Neil Stubley

The court was constantly tended throughout the championships but showed some wear by the time Andy Murray won the men's singles final

As well hand-weeding, rolling and mowing the grass to 8mm every day during a tournament, staff also have to replace the grass every summer.

They use specialist machinery to take up the grass, remove weeds and till the soil, before laying the new seed.

Wimbledon courts are laid with a mix of perennial rye grass designed especially for them by seed company Limagrain, followed by a controlled-release fertiliser made by Everri to speed up growth.

Finally, the edges of the courts are sprayed with a herbicide to stop the growth of Poa Annua - a meadow grass which spreads quickly and would disrupt the perfect surface of the courts.

The courts are watered and covered over to allow the grass to grow in a protected environment.

The grass caused controversy at this year's Wimbledon when several high-profile stars, including Maria Sharapova, blamed the surface for players slipping during matches.

But Mr Stubley insisted that the grass was exactly the same high quality as it has always been.

Wimbledon will host a number of events before next year's championships
