Not even a shooting could quench the desire for a new pair of basketballer LeBron James trainers.

Atlanta Police are not charging the shopper who shot in 'self-defense' an armed man who attempted to rob customers queuing for sneakers at the front of Wish Clothing in Little Five Points about 5.30am yesterday.

After the shooter got back in line and the would-be-thief's body removed, customers continued waiting for the coveted denim shoe.

Dozens of people were queuing at the front of Wish Clothing in Atlanta for sneakers when the shooting occurred yesterday

This is Wish Clothing, in Little Five Points, where a customer shot dead an armed robber

The dead man, who has not been identified, allegedly tried to rob a group of more than two dozen people waiting in line to buy the newly-released $180 Nike LeBron X EXT 'Denim' sneakers, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Witnesses said a man queuing in front of the Moreland Avenue store then pulled out a gun and shot the would-be robber, before getting back in line.

His identity has not been released.

The suspect then ran a few yards before collapsing. 

Atlanta Police Department spokesman, Officer John Chafee, said police have not charged anyone and currently consider the shooting to be self-defense.

Customer Taylor White said the man had tried to pick-pocket locals all week.

'(The suspect) wanted to pick-pocket everybody. But people out here, they weren't going for none of that,' White told wsbtv.com.

'I didn't even expect him to come up here, thinking it was that sweet.

'Thinking it’s that candy land like that.

'He [the shooter] really stood up for all of us.

'I salute the homie that did that.'

Miami Heat forward LeBron James has a number of trainers named after him

The shooting occured six and a half hours before the retailer opened its doors, with more than 45 people queuing for the limited edition 'exclusive' shoes at 11.30am.

One customer told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution the LeBron X EXT was worth waiting for because: 'It’s the leather and the denim. It’s basically a pair of pants on your foot.'

Wish Clothing sold its supply of the Nike LeBron X EXT in less than two hours.

Sales were likely boosted by news that James' team, the Miami Heat, won the National Basketball Association championship Thursday night.

Police said investigations continue.
