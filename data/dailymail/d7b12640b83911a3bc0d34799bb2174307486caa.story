Breaking into 100 cars in one month - at least three each night - is no easy feat.

But a trio of Chicago teens stand accused of just that after being arrested this week on auto burglary charges.

Police have publicly thanked a local resident who called authorities and accurately described the serial thieves, allowing officers to track them down and put an end to the crime spree.

'Because that one person took the time to call there, there are definitely dozens of other people whose things aren't going to go missing at this point,' Park Ridge Deputy Police Chief Lou Jogmen told CBS Chicago.

Good at what they do: Michael Staples, 17 (left), Nikolas Pena, 18 (right), and Stevan Bulatovic, 18 (below), are accused of stealing cash and valuables from at least 100 cars in a one-month Chicago crime spree

Chicago police say the three teens 'spent less than a minute' in each car and were capable of breaking into 12 in one night. Stevan Bulatovic (pictured) is one of the trio facing charges

Stevan Bulatovic, 18, Nikolas Pena, 18, and Michael T. Staples, 17, all of Harwood Heights, currently face one misdemeanor count of criminal trespass to a motor vehicle each, and two counts of burglary to a motor vehicle.

But police say the three are responsible for more than 100 car burglaries in Chicago and across surrounding suburbs Park Ridge, Northbrook, Glenview, Niles and are looking to press further charges.

Deputy Police Chief Jogmen said the young men typically targeted unlocked vehicles late at night.

They moved quickly to take anything they could.

The three walked away with cash, laptop computers, cell phones, cameras, GPS systems, wallets and other valuables.

They would would hit up to 12 cars a night, according to police.

'It was in and out,' said Jogmen.

'They were literally in the car for a minute or less and then they moved on to the next one - just went up the block and continued to pull on doors and when they found an open one they went inside, saw what they could take, and took it.'

But it wasn't every night.

'I'm sure they took a couple days off here and there,' Jogmen said.

All three were held on a $5,000 bond and are due back in court in December.Â
