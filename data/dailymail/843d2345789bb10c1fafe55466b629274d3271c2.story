Mary Cheney, the openly gay daughter of one of ex-Vice President Dick Cheney’s two daughters, has taken to Facebook to blast her older sibling, Elizabeth.

Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, aired her views on gay marriage on Friday by saying it should be something for voters to decide on a state-by-state basis, and not a matter for 'judges' or 'legislators.'

Mary Cheney, openly lesbian and married to Heather Poe since 2012, responded by posting on her personal Facebook page: 'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage.'

Sibling disputes: Even though their father backs gay marriage to an extent, Liz Cheney has now come out stating her opposition to such act. Her sister Mary (pictured left) has in turn blasted her sister for holding such views

Opinionated: Mary Cheney, the younger sister of Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Senate candidate, sharply criticized her sister¿s stance on same-sex marriage and urged her own Facebook friends to share the message

She
continued:  “Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all 
families — regardless of how they look or how they are made — all 
families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as 
every other.”

'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage.'

She concluded her post stating: 'Please like and share if you agree.'

Liz
Cheney declared in July she plans to challenge incumbent Senator Mike 
Enzi in the state’s Republican primary. The election is slated for next 
year.

Partner: Liz's sister Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe (left) in 2012. They are pictured here at a memorial for victims of the 9/11 attacks

Departure: Even Liz's father Dick Cheney, seen here with Liz in 2011, supports gay marriage. 'My general view is freedom means freedom for everyone,' he said back in 2004

‘I am not pro-gay marriage,’ Cheney said in a statement released by her campaign.

Cheney announced her run for senate against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Enzi last month.

Since then, she has accused the Enzi campaign of running ‘push poll,’ reports ABC News, one in which voters are asked ‘Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?’

The Enzi campaign has categorically denied the claims, but Cheney has now pushed back with her unequivocal declaration.

Former Vice President 
Cheney has publicly voiced support for same-sex marriage, however he 
line with Elizabeth’s stance, he has reportedly said the matter should 
be decided on a state-by-state basis.

Push back? Liz Cheney claims her opponent Mike Enzi is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters 'Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?'

Family does matter in the runup to next fall's Senate elections: Candidates are wielding famous political pedigrees in a number of races that could determine whether Democrats maintain control in the 2014 elections

LIz's stance is also a slight departure in regards to her high profile family.

Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance.

‘Lynne
and I have a gay daughter, so it’s an issue our family is very familiar
with,’ Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while 
stumping in Iowa in 2004. ‘With the respect to the question of 
relationships, my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone. 
People ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want
to.’

The Cheney family dispute mirrors the broader disagreement among Republicans on same-sex marriage.

Some
in the party believe they are losing voters, particularly younger ones,
over an issue on which public opinion has changed rapidly.

Other
Republicans believe traditional marriage is a pillar of family values, 
and in some cases are reluctant to abandon their social conservative 
base on the issue.
