Prince Philip has a ‘raging intellect’, according to the leading British portrait painter he sat for.

Jonathan Yeo, who painted the Duke of Edinburgh’s portrait several years ago, defended the royal against his critics, saying he was ‘very insightful’.

Yeo, 43, spent hours with the 93-year-old and said he found him different to his public image of ‘a figure of fun’.

The celebrity painter, who is self-taught, said he was used to challenging individuals, having also painted politicians including Tony Blair and David Cameron.

He said of the Prince: ‘His public persona is one of being a figure of fun, always saying silly and inappropriate things.

‘It was very different from my experience of him, which was of a raging intellect. He gets bored very easily and therefore to make things interesting for himself is provocative. He’s very funny.

‘You can see why, if you’re easily offended, most of the things he says to you, it would be easy [to offend].

‘But I’m used to politicians and banter, where basically if take you one view, they will take the opposite one for sport.

‘He’s very knowledgeable. He was asking insightful questions about painting.’

He said the Prince had shown Yeo some of his own paintings.

Yeo added: ‘That’s when my heart stopped. But luckily it wasn’t terrible. They were very much early 20th century theme – sort of Bonnard style. I remember going “wow they’re amazing!”.
