A new father was tragically killed in a motorbike accident just 12 hours before his first son was born.

Michael Coray died in hospital at 3.30am on Saturday after being airlifted to hospital with severe head injuries following a crash three days earlier.

Just over 12 hours later, his partner Gemma-Louise Dunne gave birth to his son, Kylan Zane Michael Coray, a name he chose.

Looking after her baby at home this week, heartbroken Miss Dunne said: 'My loving partner will live on in our son.

'The day I gave birth to our baby we thought it would be the most amazing day of our lives. Mike was so excited to be a daddy, but that was sadly taken away from us.

'I know he would have made a great dad because he was already an amazing dad to our other children, he took them as his own.

'He was the most loving and caring partner anyone could ask for. He had so much to look forward to.'

Mr Coray, 25, died at Royal Aintree Hospital in Liverpool following the crash in his home town of Warrington, Cheshire.

Police
 say he was riding his Aprilia motorbike when it collided with a black 
Ford Focus, whose driver was unhurt in the accident.

He
 had been with Miss Dunne, 29, nearly three years, and acted as a father
 figure to her sons Bradley, eight, and Jayden, seven.

His mother Yvonne Coray held Mr Coray's hand in hospital, where he died surrounded by family.

Mrs Coray and Mr Coray's father Nigel said: 'Our beautiful son Michael, we have no words to describe how we're feeling.

'He made us laugh, he made us cry, but most of all, he made us happy. We used to look at you and we would be so proud of you.

'He
 was so happy when he found out Gemma was pregnant, he couldn't stop 
smiling. He would have been a fantastic dad to his little boy. He has left a huge gap that will never be filled.'

Michelle Coulson, 32, is Mr Coray's cousin but says the pair were 'like brother and sister'.

She described the motorbike lover, who could fix cars aged 12, as a 'gorgeous' personality with a 'big heart'.

Close 
since they were children, Miss Coulson took Mike on his first night out 
in Warrington, and went on family holidays to Lanzarote, Portugal and 
Wales together.

Miss Coulson witnessed the aftermath of the crash and sat with the Mr Coray, who was a welder by trade, as emergency crews 
arrived.

Miss Coulson said: 'He was a cheeky chappy, like a little Del Boy, always wheeling and dealing.

'He
 had the biggest heart, everyone adored him, he would do anything for 
anyone. I'll miss having him around, his phone calls, him needing me.

'Anywhere I went I'd know I'd see him on his bike, beep and wave and I'll miss his lovely smile. My heart will always be broken.'

The family also thanked medical crews at the scene and staff at Aintree Hospital for their 'brilliant' care of Mr Coray.

Cheshire Police are investigating the collision on Wednesday which also involved a black Ford Focus.
