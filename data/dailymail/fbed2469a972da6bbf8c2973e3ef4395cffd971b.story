Fresh-faced and dressed in a simple white shirt, the woman peering out of Richard Young's portrait of Sophie Wessex released over the weekend appeared to be in her mid-30s at most.

But the while the Countess of Wessex might have the complexion of a much-younger woman, she is celebrating her 50th birthday today.

So how has she managed to stay so fresh faced? 'Her secret is a good skincare routine and a healthy living,' says skin expert Samantha Gilbert of Swiss skincare brand Cellcosmet.

Fresh-faced: At 50, Sophie Wessex still has the glowing complexion of a much-younger woman

'Sophie is always smiling and looking happy too and this also has an effect on the skin.' And as she celebrates her half-century with a visit to a London hospital, the Countess has plenty to smile about.

The mother of two young children, 11-year-old Lady Louise Windsor and seven-year-old James, Viscount Severn, Sophie juggles family life with an increasingly busy schedule of royal engagements - including two today.

Like much of the work she does, the focus will be on the disadvantaged and disabled with the visit including a trip to see the work of the Avoidable Blindness Programme which is funded by the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Trust.

And in a further sign of Sophie's popularity within the royal family - in particular with the Queen - the Countess is set to be confirmed as vice-patron of the Trust, second only to the monarch.

But while her extensive charity work might fly relatively under the radar, her increasing sartorial confidence hasn't gone unnoticed - and neither has her fresh-faced complexion.

What's more, none of it, says top cosmetic surgeon Dr Roberto Viel, is the result of surgical nips and tucks. 

'Sophie is proof that lots of sleep and eating well keep you looking young,' says Dr Viel. 'Stop calorie counting and start enjoying the right foods. 

'Sophie also has great bone structure which always helps.'

Lily Simpson, a nutritional expert and founder of The Detox Kitchen, agrees. 'Sophie Wessex looks fabulous at 50 thanks to her beautiful glowing skin. 

'A diet of plant-based foods and lean protein has a huge impact on the appearance of skin, as does keeping well hydrated and getting proper sleep.'

Exercise is also crucial for keeping the years at bay, although as Rosalind Chapman, founder of cosmeceutical brand Transformulas, points out, this needs to be supplemented with good skincare.

'Sophie  leads a very healthy lifestyle - she rides horses and runs regularly both of which help keep her body and skin in great condition,' explains Chapman.

'She also lives out in the country which means there is less exposure to the damage caused by pollution and free radicals.'

But that's not all. 'The tone and texture of her skin is beautiful which suggests she uses some sort of brightening serum,' continues Chapman.

'Although she has some fine lines, her complexion is peaches and cream and that is what is most important for mature skin. A lack of tone and texture is far more ageing than lines and wrinkles.' 

That Sophie manages to pull all this off, despite having an increasingly busy schedule is no mean feat, although her embrace of cleverly applied make-up undoubtedly helps.

Careful choices: Her choice of make-up echoes the increasingly sophisticated shades in her wardrobe

Low key: Sophie, seen here meeting actress Laura Carmichael, opts for delicate peachy shades on cheeks

'Sophie has a great way of keeping her make up very balanced and clean,' explains bareMinerals make-up artist Sarah-Jane Froom.

'She lives by the less is more rule, which, when you are a public figure representing the royal family, is important.'

But, adds Froom, low key doesn't mean boring. 'Sophie keeps it classic but adds an up-to-date edge by subtly following tone and shade trends in her lip and blush and also the finish on her skin. 

'This could mean making her look slightly more dewy or matte, using different shades of peach or pink nudes on lips and livening the whole thing up by adding a pop of soft pink or peach on the cheeks. 

'Eyes are kept to a minimum but with definition. You will notice Sophie generally keeps most of the eye make-up to the top lid - this is a great way of keeping a look more natural.'

Her embrace of nude make-up echoes the soft palette that dominates her wardrobe. Gone are the pillarbox reds and lilacs that dominated her early years in the royal family and in their place are subtle cream, delicate shell pink and dramatic black.

Looking good: As Sophie Wessex enters her sixth decade, she looks lovelier than ever

Nowhere was this more obvious than during her appearance at church alongside the rest of the royal family at Sandringham last Christmas.

Resplendent in a powder pink coat, a smiling Sophie looked fresh-face and glowing, with the rosy colour of the coat emphasising naturally rosy cheeks.

She pulled off the same trick during a pre-Christmas visit to the races at Ascot in Berkshire, echoing the deep charcoal shade of her tweed suit in her soft, grey eyeliner.

At Royal Ascot last June, the glamorous Countess ensured all eyes were on her - despite facing stiff competition from the Queen and other members of the royal family - when she showed up in a dramatic all-black ensemble teamed with fresh pink cheeks and minimal eye make-up.

This less-is-more approach is key to looking good in your 50s, says make-up artist Mikey Phillips, who explains that the key to taking 10 years off is to keep your look fresh but polished.

'Sophie is a fan of minimal make-up but she isn't afraid to use make-up to define her features,' he explains. 

'The result is youthful, classic and timeless.'

Fresh-faced: Sophie Wessex might be 50 but she looks as glamorous as ever

While Sophie Wessex benefits from having beautiful skin and a great bone structure, those not so blessed can recreate the look using make-up. 

Celebrity make-up artist Mikey Phillips explains how getting Sophie's fresh-faced glow is done (and all within 10 minutes):

SKIN 

'Prep skin for make-up with a really good primer. I Love Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream (£70, charlottetilbury.com), which hydrates and adds radiance while making cosmetics stay on longer.

Next choose a light reflecting concealer such as Joan Collins Beauty Fade to Perfect (£18, joancollinsbeauty.com) in a shade that is one lighter than your real skin tone.

Apply all around the eye area and pat gently into place, This should lift your entire face and give the illusion of eight hours sleep.

Foundation is also key to getting a youthful look but make sure it's something light-reflective and moisturising such as YSL Le Teint Touche Éclat Foundation (£30.50, yslbeauty.co.uk).

Blend the foundation around the concealer - don't be tempted to go over it - and make sure it's an exact match with your skintone.

CHEEKS

A cream blush such as Bobbi Brown's Pot Rouge (£19, bobbibrown.co.uk) will give you an instant glow while the creamy formula won't collect in any wrinkles.

Apply it to the apples of your cheeks using your fingers and blend it back towards the hairline.  

LIPS 

Colour your lips using the same cream blush you used on your cheeks and finish with a lipliner - a beauty essential for older women.

Lips shrink as you age, so a defined lip line can help lift and define the face. I like the Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay In Place Lip Pencil (£17, esteelauder.co.uk).

EYES 

As Sophie's defined brows demonstrate, groomed eyebrows totally change your face and pull up the eye area and the whole face with it.

Choose a shade a little darker than your hair then start filling in using tiny strokes from the inside edges out.

Extend the line past the end of your lashes to frame your face and knock off the years. New CID Cosmetics i-groom is great for natural-looking brows (£17, newcidcosmetics.com).

Use a neutral base such as the ones found in Burberry's Complete Eye Palette in Pale Nude (£40, burberry.com) on the eyelids themselves, colouring from lash to brow, and then add a mid tone from base to crease. 

Sweep the same shade underneath the lower lashes to really this same shade and sweep underneath lower lashes to open up the eyes.

Finally, finish off the look with a sweep of black eyeliner across the top lashes and two coats of mascara to make eyes pop. I swear by Bobbi Brown Gel Eyeliner in Black Brown (£18, bobbibrown.co.uk) and CODE Volumising Lengthening Mascara in black (£19.95, code-beautiful.com).

Although lots of people think brown is softer, I always avoid it because it tends to make eyes look tired and sore.'
