They're often too sick to get out of bed, but the lion-hearted children of this New Hampshire hospital can still roar.

In a touching tribute to generous donors, the young patients at the Children's Hospital at Dartmouth-Hitchcock (CHaD) have released their own inspiring cover of Katy Perry's single, 'Roar'.

The emotional clip, in which the small children lip-synch to the powerful pop tune, has gone viral with nearly 70,000 YouTube hits.

Perry's hit song, which is about being a fighter in the face of a challenge, resonated deeply with hospital staff and patients.

CHaD child life specialist, Holly 
Gaspar, thought the video would be a beautiful way to pay tribute to 
those who supported the CHaD HERO fundraiser held on Sunday, which 
raised more than $650,000 for CHaD.

'All of our CHaD Kids have a roar,' 
Gaspar told Londonderry Patch. 'Sometimes we hear it, sometimes we see it, and sometimes 
we feel it. They are strong, they are brave, they are all fighters.'

Even Dr. James Weinstein, the president and CEO of Dartmouth-Hitchcock, made a special cameo, along with hospital administrators and the children's families.

The footage was gathered in a day when all of the children featured felt well enough to get out of bed 
and dance.
