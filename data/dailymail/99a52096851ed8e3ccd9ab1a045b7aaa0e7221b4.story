Two NFL draft prospects who left the bathroom of their Indianapolis hotel room covered in urine and feces during a scouting event in February have been identified as Clemson's DeAndre Hopkins and Rutgers wide receiver Mark Harrison, league sources told ESPN.

A report emerged over the weekend revealing that the staff at the Crowne Plaza Indianapolis Downtown discovered urine and feces in the bathroom, found the bathroom mirror matted with toothpaste and had to clean up leftover food discarded on one of the beds.

The hotel manager photographed the repulsive scene and sent photographs to National Football Scouting president Jeff Foster, who confirmed the embarrassing incident but failed to identify the instigators.

Claims: NFL sources allege Clemson wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, left at the Chick-fil-A Bowl in Dec., and Rutgers wide receiver Mark Harrison, right in Sep., were responsible for the disgusting hotel room

Scene: The two men were roommates for three nights in a room at the Crowne Plaza Indianapolis Downtown

A report published on Monday described the appalling state of the room, located on the first floor of the hotel, but did not identify the occupants of the room.

On Thursday, ESPN reporter Adam Schefter tweeted the identity of the players, citing NFL sources who have not been named.

Hopkins, who has been rumored to be a late first-round draft pick, and Harrison did share a room for their nights at the event but have denied any wrongdoing.

The football league hosts the week-long combine every year in February at the Lucas Oil Stadium in downtown Indianapolis.

Draft prospects strut their athletic prowess before NFL coaches, general managers and scouts in anticipation of the NFL draft in April.

The 2013 NFL Scouting Combine was held from February 20 - 26.

Just one hour after identifying DeAndre 
Hopkins and Mark Harrison as the alleged perpetrators, Mr Schefter posted a follow-up message on Thursday night saying, 'NFL 
sources said they are convinced that Rutgers wide receiver Mark Harrison
is not responsible for the trashed hotel room.'

Rutgers' former Head Coach Kyle Flood also issued a statement to Schefter defending his player.

'I've been on a lot of road trips and 
we’ve never had a single disciplinary issue with him,' Mr Flood said.

'He’s a model of 
the type of person we want here at Rutgers. It would be so out of 
character to be involved in this that I just cannot imagine under any 
circumstance that it would happen and involve him.'

Mr Flood then retweeted the message from Schefter that cast doubt on the accusations implicating Mr Harrison .

His agent, Ed Wasielewski, also has denied Harrison was involved.

'My client completely denies having anything to do with the hotel incident,' he said.

According to Mr Wasielewski's Twitter profile he was in Indianapolis for the week of the combine event in Indianapolis.

Clemson wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins has also denied he was involved in any shenanigans, in an interview with FOXSports on Thursday.

He claims he checked out of the hotel room before Harrison and said the hotel room was fine when he left.

'I got done before Mark Harrison, so I was already packed. I already took a shower and packed and everything.'

'Mark came in and we spoke for at least 20 minutes about the Combine. Then the bellman came in and helped me get my bags out. And I left. That’s honestly all I can say.'

He says he doubts that Harrison had anything to do with the incident.

'I say check the [security] cameras, that’s the best way that you’re going to get the answer. Check the cameras and check the timing of everything.'

Requests for comment placed to the NFL and to the NFL's Scouting Combine were not returned.

In the travel information page on the 
NFL 2013 Scouting Combine website, it lists the Crowne Plaza 
Indianapolis Downtown, which is adjacent
to the Lucas Oil Stadium, as the hotel of choice for participants in 
event. 

A representative from the hotel told 
the MailOnline that they would not comment or elaborate on anything 
having to do with the Scouting Combine.

National Football Scouting president Jeff Foster confirmed the shocking incident to Yahoo reporter Jason Cole earlier this week.

'I can confirm that a room was left in an inappropriate condition and we're disappointed by both players who occupied the room,' he said.

'There was no material damage to the room; otherwise we would be pursuing further action and really be trying to get to the bottom of the situation. It's just very disappointing, and the people we feel the worst for are the people at the Crowne Plaza who had to clean it up.'

Mr Foster reportedly warned all participants at the event to be on their best behavior and to keep in mind that all their movements during their week in Indianapolis would be observed.

Both agents for the players had called Foster after the incident was reported, in order to deny the allegations. 

One unnamed NFL coach reportedly told ESPN he was extremely disappointed to hear about the allegations involving Hopkins.

League sources have said such an incident could greatly damage a prospect's chances at the upcoming draft.
