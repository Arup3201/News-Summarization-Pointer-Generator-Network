David Cameron today led calls for a 'rethink' of the £90 price tag on the new replica England football shirt.

The Prime Minister said fans would 'welcome' the Football Association and kit makers Nike reconsidering the hefty costs which have been condemned as a 'rip-off' by fans.

The government has insisted the charges are 'not right' and risk punishing loyal supporters who are 'the bedrock of our national game'.

Problem: Supporters fear they are being priced out of purchasing England's World Cup strips - with the new Brazil shirt costing £90

Worth it? The home and away kits go on sale for as much as £90 before the tournament kicks off

Fans are unhappy that the new, costly kit has been launched less than a year after the last new strip went on sale.

It was only last May that the previous home kit was released, which has been worn just seven times.

The red away kit, released even more recently in June 2013, has had just two airings.

The £90 shirt is identical to those worn by Roy Hodgson's side, while an adult 'stadium' England shirt is priced at £60 and shirts for children aged between eight and 15 cost £42, with mini-kits priced at £40.

Sports minister Helen Grant took to Twitter to say: 'On £90 England football shirts for fans, it's not right. Loyal supporters are the bedrock of our national game - pricing needs a rethink.'

Prime Minister David Cameron called for a rethink on the prices after a backlash from fans

Mr Cameron's officials spokesman said the PM backed Miss Grant and called for Nike to think again.

He told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'I'm sure all fans would welcome a rethink.'

The spokesman said it was 'clearly not' for the Government to set the price of football shirts.

But he added: 'It is a matter for the manufacturers and the FA, but does he agree with Helen Grant that £90 is a great deal of money for a replica shirt? Absolutely.

'Would a rethink by the manufacturer be welcomed by all fans? I'm sure that would be the case.'

Labour's shadow sports minister Clive Efford said the price of the shirts was 'disappointing'.

Justine Roberts, founder of popular 
parenting website Mumsnet, said: 'With the previous kit less than a year
 old and the away shirt worn only twice since then, it's not hard to see
 why some people might just think the FA are exploiting England fans by 
churning out yet another expensively priced version.

'When we asked our users about this this issue, an overwhelming majority thought football merchandise was a rip off.

'Instead
 of charging £60-plus for an 8-year-old’s kit, the FA could lead the way
 and produce a fairly priced kit so all England fans could afford to buy
 it and show support for the national team.'

The
 latest shirts - to be worn at the World Cup in Brazil this summer - are
 going on sale on April 3, less than a year after the previous ones were
 released.

Mark Perryman, a member of England Supporters Club, said: ‘They certainly don’t help themselves the fact two new shirts were introduced well before the 18 months.

‘They seem to have broken that rule. I thought it was a legal requirement.

‘The FA are in a difficult position, they can’t have a Nike home kit and Umbro away kit.

‘I suppose the FA’s excuse for 
releasing the kits so early is that it’s a World Cup year, but I’m sorry
 they should’ve thought about that when they signed the contract with 
Nike. It’s crazy.’

Not happy! Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton isn't best pleased at the price of the shirt

Tough! Stan Collymore has branded kit maker Nike a 'joke' for the way in which they've handled the release

In the mid-2000s replica England shirts were on sale for £30 almost as soon as they were released.

The
 prices have since risen steeply, but they are dependent on results on 
the field. Following England’s 4-1 defeat to Germany in the 2010 World 
Cup the price for the replica shirts worn in that tournament plummeted.

Perryman, who has been a member of the ESC for 18 years, added: 'At the end of the day people will vote with their chests. If England are doing well, people will buy it.

‘If they lose to Italy in the World Cup it will drop to a fraction of that £90 price.’

Outrage from punters and those involved in the game poured out across social media websites.

Joey Barton said on Twitter: ‘£90 for the new England shirt is taking the mickey out of the fans. When will it stop?

‘I wonder what ‘magic’ technology it has this time that forces the price up but doesn’t actually work.

Coming thick and fast: These are the second new kits to have been released in the past year by England

‘Also [it’s] technology that the supporters don’t need. When will brands start to listen? Fans just want to feel a part of it. Part of the tribe.

‘[It’s] appalling, in my opinion. Football again allows commercialism to eat away at its soul. Something has got to give.

‘Its literally a white sports top with an England badge on. Costs about £2 pound tops to make in some sweatshop in the East.’

Stan Collymore added: ‘Nike have gone down American route. A “Match” shirt and “stadium” shirt, like NBA do. A joke, just make one please, £90 is a rip off.’

The FA are not allowed by UK and EU law to get involved with setting the price of the replica shirts.

A spokesman said: 'The FA is a not-for-profit Organisation that puts £100m back into the game every year.

'It is through relationships with partners such as Nike that we are able to maintain that level of investment in football.

'The FA's policy is to avoid any involvement with how its partners or licensees set their prices, so as to avoid any risk of or implications of price fixing.'

Nike have pointed out that the £60 replica kit is the one aimed at fans, whereas the £90 shirt is the exact one worn by the players with the full technological additions.

The prices are recommended to retailers who are able to set their own value.

A spokesman also confirmed that the kit cycle would return in future, saying: 'The previous kit marked the start of the partnership between England and The FA and the timing of the agreement put us in an unusual circumstance with regards to kit cycle.

'A normal kit cycle will resume with the new kits – the home kit will stay the same for two years, and the away for one year.'
