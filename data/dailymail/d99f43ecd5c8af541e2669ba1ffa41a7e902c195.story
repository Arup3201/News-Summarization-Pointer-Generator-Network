Tribunal win: Former BBC IT boss John Linwood has successfully argued he was unfairly dismissed by the corporation over a failed £100m project

A BBC manager who ran a botched IT project that cost the licence fee payer £100million was unfairly dismissed because the corporation plotted to blame him when it was scrapped, an employment tribunal has found. 

John Linwood, who was paid a salary of £280,000, said he was made a 'scapegoat' and sacked in a 'stitch-up' over the expensive failure last year.

The tribunal panel criticised the BBC's 'culture and climate' that involved 'the steering of the spotlight of blame in other directions'.

The corporation sacked him claiming he should be treated the same as a 'manager of a relegated football team', but a tribunal decided today this decision was 'cavalier'.

The BBC had ploughed £125.9 million into the scheme he managed - an attempt to create an integrated digital production and archiving system.

But it was scrapped by current director-general Tony Hall in his first weeks in the job leaving a net cost of £98.4 million.

It could now face a payout of as much as £100,000 after the tribunal verdict. 

The central London tribunal said Mr Linwood's claim he was unfairly dismissed was 'well-founded', but added that he had 'contributed' to his dismissal as well.

It rejected two other complaints he made against the corporation.

A BBC spokesman said it had been 'a very difficult set of circumstances' for the corporation.

He said: 'We had a major failure of a significant project, and we had lost confidence - as the tribunal acknowledges - in John Linwood. At the time we believed we acted appropriately.

'The tribunal has taken a different view - we are disappointed with the outcome, but nevertheless we will learn lessons from the judgment and we're grateful to staff who were involved in dealing with a very difficult case.'

Mr Linwood told the hearing that after leaving one meeting about his future, he was told by the BBC's head of strategy, John Tate, that the procedure leading up to his dismissal in July 2013 was 'a stitch up'.

It also heard from the BBC's then head of communications Gavin Dawson that Mr Linwood was 'arguably' a scapegoat, but he added that 'is not the way I would characterise it'. 

In one, a BBC boss, Pat Younge, said Mr Linwood could 'just spin in the wind' while Mr Coles could 'position yourself as the man who took it over, reviewed it and called time'.

The tribunal said the emails represented a 'culture and climate' that involved 'the steering of the spotlight of blame in other directions, on the part of those who felt themselves to be in danger of association with a sinking ship'.

It refused to accept the BBC's claim that 'this case was broadly analogous to...the manager of a relegated football team' and said some HR staff behaved at times with 'a cavalier disregard for any of the accepted norms of a fair disciplinary process' by not giving Mr Linwood enough time to study some of the evidence used against him.

The tribunal's report revealed Mr Linwood was paid a 'sign-on bonus' of £140,000 on top of his salary within 18 months of starting work at the BBC in 2009.

The tribunal ruling is another expensive footnote to the DMI fiasco, which experts predict could cost the Corporation another £100,000.

Julie Morris, a partner in employment law at Slater & Gordon, told MailOnline: 'His maximum compensation would be £74,200 assuming he was dismissed before 6 April 2014.

'On top of that, he may also have a claim for his notice - for which he could also recover £25,000 in an Employment Tribunal.'
