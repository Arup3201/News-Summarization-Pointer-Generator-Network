Missing: Authorities have stepped up the search for Bonny Anne Cooner, pictured, who disappeared from her Canon, Georgia, home more than a week ago

The live-in boyfriend of a Georgia mother who vanished more than a week ago 'knows where she is dead or alive' his niece has alleged in a series of angry Facebook posts.

Bonny Anne Cooner, 33, was last seen on January 28 at the home she shared with her boyfriend Brent and 12-year-old son Gavin in the Franklin County town of Canon.

On Wednesday, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation joined the Franklin County Sheriff's Office in the hunt for Cooner as it emerged that a woman claiming to be Brent's niece had alleged her uncle was behind the disappearance just days after she went missing.

Michelle Pilgrim commented on a Facebook page called 'rants or raves of elberton ga'
on February 1, 2013, saying that police had searched her grandmother's 
property for traces of the missing woman and that her uncle allegedly 
knew Cooner's whereabouts.

'Brent knows whats up. push him until
he gives,' Michelle Pilgrim wrote to Cooner's family members on the 
social networking site.

She
then said: 'If u want some 411 on brent, inbox me... plz inbox me. 
there is some things u and UR FAMILY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT HIM IF U DONT 
ALREADY KNOW (sic).'

The woman alleges that Brent drove off on Sunday night with Cooner, leaving her son, Gavin, and his friend at the house.

'He came back after leavin an arguin with her alone,' she wrote on Facebook.

'We
all know she aint leave gavin like that. we know she would have called 
someone by now. so if u dont push him for answers, thats on u. but i 
promise brent know where she is. dead or alive he knows (sic).'

Cooner was reported missing by a 
family member.

When officers arrived at the home they found her son, 
Cooner's car and other belongings still there.

Special Agent Mike Ayers said it was too soon to draw any conclusions about the circumstances of her disappearance.

'I'd be guessing about whether we have a crime or just a missing person,' he told OnlineAthens.

Police, however, said after disappearance that her boyfriend woke up and found Cooner was gone from the home.

Pilgrim wrote on Facebook that Brent has been in her family since he was 12.

'When his mom died, my grandma took him and my papa jim in,' she wrote.

'i know his manipulative ways... i go back with brent like no other (sic),' she said in another comment.

Pilgrim also claimed she wouldn't help police in the case because they 'never helped lock brent up in the past when he showed up @ my door with gavin in the truck and a gun his pocket ready to shoot my ma..'

Investigators have been questioning friends, family, associates and anyone who may have information about Bonny's whereabouts for 10 days now but have not released any breakthroughs in the case.

They are also going through her phone records.

Meanwhile, her family is frantically trying to locate her and have created a Facebook page called 'Please help Bonny Anne Cooner' in an effort to aide the search.

They have also posted missing persons notices on Craigslist websites across the country.

Cooner is described as white, 5-foot-5, 160-170 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes.

She has multiple tattoos including a butterfly on her shoulder, and flowers and blossoms on her left arm below the elbow.

Anyone with information about Cooner's disappearance is encouraged to call the Georgia Bureau of Investigation or the Franklin County Sheriff's Office at 706-384-2525.
