Newcastle have been rebuffed in an initial attempt to sign M'Baye Niang from AC Milan. 

The former Caen forward has been courted by Arsenal, Tottenham, Everton and West Ham over recent seasons. 

The 20-year-old would like to join a Premier League side with Milan willing to let him leave, and wanting to add an option to buy clause to the deal, but Niang is also waiting to see if any other offers come in.

The Frenchman courted a similar move away from the San Siro 12 months ago - leaving Milan for a six-month loan spell with Ligue 1 side Montpellier, which did not work out as well as hoped.

Although he scored on his debut against Rodez in the Coupe de France and managed four more goals in the first few months, his form dropped dramatically afterwards and he only netted once more in the next 17 games before being returned to Milan. 

The Magpies are also reportedly willing to take Niang on a six-month loan deal, providing that an option to buy the striker outright at the end of the season is included.

Newcastle may also have to fend off recent interest from the likes of Olympiakos and Udinese if they want to secure the striker's signature.

Niang spent an unsuccessful loan period with Montpellier last season before returning to Serie A
