The Catts of Katy, Texas seemed to be a normal, quiet, family before their secret lives as bank robbers was revealed last year.

Scott Catt, 50, and his 20-year-old son Hayden and 18-year-old daughter Abby stole $100,000 in two bank robberies before they were arrested at their middle-class apartment complex.

In a confessional prison interview, Scott Catt told Texas Monthly how he recruited his two children to become his accomplices in crime.

'All I can tell you is that I thought it would help us as a family,' Catt said.

'I did it for the family,' he said. 'I swear to you, I would only rob banks for my family.'

Catt first started robbing banks after his wife's death in 1997 from breast cancer, when Hayden was five and Abby was two.

The widower turned to alcohol and drugs to deal with the pain and began to struggle financially.

It was around 2000 or 2002 that he carried out his first robbery at a bank in McMinnville, Oregon where the family was then living.

After dropping the kids off at school, Catt drove to a nearby bank where he wore a ball cap, black sweats, a white painter's mask and sunglasses as a disguise. He threatened the tellers with an unloaded antique pistol and came away with $2,500.

A few days later, police issued a grainy photo of Catt from surveillance footage.

'My mother said the man in the photo looked a little like me, and I just laughed,' Catt said. 'And that was it. We all went out for dinner that night. The police never came to knock on my door.'

After that first heist, Catt was addicted and he continued to rob banks about once a year. Oregon authorities now believe Catt was responsible for about five unsolved robberies in the state.

'I didn’t feel like a criminal,' he told me. 'I didn’t load my pistol. I knew I wasn’t going to shoot anybody. And I kept telling myself that whatever money I got was insured, so who was really being hurt?'

Catt led a double life, convincing everyone who knew him that he was just a devoted dad who made a point of cooking for his kids every night.

Back in McMinnville, Catt is remembered as a single dad who supported his two kids and took them on summer trips to amusement parks.

He also became the president of the swim club his kids participated in. Kathryn Lundeen, who served on the club's board says Catt 'showed a lot of leadership...I liked the guy. He never struck me as being a person who had poor judgement.

The children only got involved after Catt moved to Texas for a new job as an engineer at energy-firm Kinder Morgan.

Sister and brother: The Catts were arrested after a bank robbery last October. Abby (left) is serving a five year sentence and brother Hayden (right) is serving a 10-year sentence. Abby will be eligible for parole after 18 months, while her brother will be eligible after four years

Punished: Scott Catt will spend the next 24 years in jail for his many robberies. He will be 62 years old by the time he is able to leave prison

The job paid a comfortable $40/hour but Catt couldn't help start thinking about another robbery and getting more money per bust with a 'team of accomplices'.

Catt didn't have any friends he knew he could trust in Texas, and instead turned to his two children. He also saw the money as a way to help them out.

'They were floundering,' he said. 'I could see the despair in Hayden, and I thought he could use—I don’t know—some inspiration, some excitement. Same with Abby. She had lost her self-esteem, not graduating from high school. All I can tell you is that I thought doing it would give us all a little boost in our lives—that it would help us as a family.'

Catt first revealed his criminal side-job to son Hayden back in Oregon.

'We were 
sitting at the kitchen table,' Hayden remembers. 'I was having some 
coffee, and he said he had something important to tell me. He said he 
had a second job as a part-time bank robber. The way he looked at me, I 
knew he wasn’t kidding.'

'Who else can you trust except family?' Scott said.

The
 two eventually decided to approach Abby, who worked as a sales person 
at a Victoria's Secret store in a local mall, hoping she could act as 
their getaway driver.

It was Hayden that approached his sister about the plan, while she was listening to music in her bedroom. 

'I
 need to tell you something,' Hayden said. 'Dad’s a bank robber, I’m 
going to become one too, and we want you to join us...We want you to be our
 wheel man.'

Abby agreed, but mostly because she felt she had to protect her family.

Cool dad: Catt was devoted to taking his children on summer vacations, especially to amusement parks

'This was something I felt like I had to do, to protect them, to make sure they got out of the bank and didn’t get shot or something,' she told me. 'I didn’t want to let Dad down.'

The three conducted their first robbery on August 9, 2013 - on Abby's day off from Victoria's Secret.

They covered the plates on Abby's Jetta and drove to a nearby bank where Catt and Hayden entered and ordered the tellers to empty their cash drawers.

All the while, Abby idled in the parking lot and used a walkie-talkie to update her dad and brother on the time. After raiding the bank's vault, the father and son exited the bank and got into the Jetta as Abby drove a normal speed home.

Back at the apartment, they emptied their bags and realized they had stolen $70,000.

They celebrated that night by treating themselves to dinner out at Tex-Mex chain Chuy's.

Abby says she was anxious, waiting for police to come in the restaurant and arrest them. But her brother was walking on air.

'I felt exhilaration, the most intense high I’ve ever experienced,' Hayden said. 'It changed my life. I’ll be truthful about that.'

But the money was gone in just a month. Catt spent it buying himself a new $10,000 motorcycle, a $17,000 Tahoe SUV for Hayden, a $12,600 Ford Focus for Abby as well as groceries, restaurants, clothes, furniture and, according to Catt, 'some partying'.

They carried out their second heist on October 1. This time Catt and his son dressed as road workers, complete with overalls and orange safety vests.

Clues: Catt and his son dressed as road workers for their robbery of the First Community Credit Union on October 1. Police eventually caught the family after tracing their safety vest purchases

The three raided the First Community Credit Union and came away with $30,000 this time.

They weren't caught immediately, but this time the Catt family gave police a clue that would lead to their downfall.

Witnesses at the bank remembered the robbers road-worker's uniforms and how the vests looked like they were brand new.

Police then were able to trace purchase of the vests to a local Home Depot, and found the family at checkout on surveillance footage.

The three were arrested at their apartment on November 9, the same day they planned to carry out another bank robbery.

The family immediately confessed to their crimes after their arrest and agreed to a plea deal late last year.

Abby was sentenced to five years in prison, and will be eligible for parole in 18 months. Her bother got a 10-year sentence and will be eligible for parole in 4 years.

Catt, meanwhile, got a 24 year sentence and will be 62 years old by the time he gets out of prison.

In the months since his arrest, Catt has lost seventy pounds as he's racked with guilt for causing his children to become convicts.

'When I look back on what I did, what led to this place, I would have been better off—we all would have been better off—if I had gone on welfare and been a stay-at-home dad.'

While both Catt children expressed remorse for their actions, they don't hold a grudge against their father for corrupting them.

Hayden says when he gets out of prison he'd like to go to college, and maybe train to become an engineer just like his dad.

Abby holds a bit more hostility towards her father saying, he 'should have been protecting me, instead of the other way around'

But just before her interview, she came across her father in the prison infirmary and the two had an emotional reunion.

'He told me he loved me, to be strong, and to be patient. And then he said he was so sorry. I broke down and started crying. I mean, like I’ve said, he is my dad.'
