John Edwards continued to ask his elderly heiress-turned benefactor for millions long after his failed bid for the presidency ended, even asking for $3million just months before he was indicted for corruption.

Another witness, Edwards' former friend Tim Toben, recounted a conversation that he had with him in 2008, where he said that it would be as easy as a 'chip shot' for Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, a rich heiress, to fund a foundation for $50million.

A year later, after news of his affair with Rielle Hunter became public and his onetime aide Andrew Young was planning on releasing a memoir that told of their false paternity plot, Edwards saw Mr Toben again and turned the tables on Mr Young.

Edwards said that Mr Young, who is now one of the lead witnesses for the prosecution, 'crossed a line'.

ABC News tells of how Mr Toben recounted: 'And then 
(Edwards) said something frustrating to me: That Andrew had tried to 
bilk Ms. Mellon out of $50million... I don't think he remembered a year 
earlier he told me it would be a 'chip shot' for her to fund the 
foundation, And it was the exact same number.'

The money given by 101-heiress Ms 
Mellon is at the heart of the Edwards corruption trial, as it has to be 
determined whether or not the former Senator himself knew that the money
was used for his campaign or whether it was understood to be a ‘gift’ 
that could be put towards the cover-up of his pregnant mistress.

If found guilty of breaking campaign finance laws, Edwards faces up to 30 years in prison.

Two
of Monday’s witnesses focused their testimony on the heiress’ funds, 
and one is thought to have given a slight advantage to Edwards’ defense 
by saying she viewed her payments as gifts from one friend to another 
rather than political contributions.

'I think her primary interest was in John as a person,’ Ms Mellon’s money manager Alex D. Forger told the court.

‘She in her later years has had few 
close friends. Her husband had died, her daughter was ill. She took a 
liking to Senator Edwards. Whatever was of interest to him, she would 
support.’

'Good morning for the home team': Edwards thought that the testimony put forth by Mellon-friend Alex Forger was good for his case, saying Mellon gave the money as a friend and not as a political contributor

Tallying up her 
donations is the complicated crux of the trial, as she gave $2,300 to 
the campaign- the amount legally allowed- along with $6.4million to 
political action committees and organizations related to Edwards,  and 
then a further $725,000 to former Edwards aide Andrew Young.

Mr
Forger testified that Ms Mellon was asked for the $725,000 by Mr Young,
and she gave it even though he simply said it was for a ‘personal need’
of Edwards’ and did not specify further.

It is now clear that personal need was the effort used to hide his mistress Rielle Hunter and her ever-growing baby bump.

Edwards
maintains that he did not know of Mr Young’s requests, and that Mr 
Young pocketed much of the money to build a mansion for his family.

‘She felt very strongly for John Edwards,’ Mr Forger told the court, explaining that her intentions were personal and ‘she wasn’t interested in becoming secretary of state’.

In light of Mr Forger’s testimony, Edwards was overheard whispering ‘It was a good morning for the home team’ to his 30-year-old daughter Cate, who has been present throughout the trial.

The tougher moment for Edwards’ team today, however, came when Ms Mellon’s librarian Tony Willis, who works in the heiress’ botanical library, began speaking about the letter he helped her draft when she decided to decline the former Senator’s request for $3million to help start the next phase of his life in 2011.

Though the heiress got Mr Willis to help her draft the letter, her lawyers later stopped her from sending it because, at the time, it was well-documented that Edwards was the subject of a grand jury investigation.

Edwards’ lawyers pushed- and were successful in their bid- to have this evidence removed from the trial, arguing that it would taint the juror’s impression of the man.

They said that the $725,000 given by Ms Mellon during the actual campaign is the money in question, and not later amounts.

Other personal friends of Ms Mellon have spoken at the trial, including the most entertaining testimony of interior designer Bryan Huffman.

Appearing in the Greensboro court last week, Mr Huffman said that Ms Mellon was not necesarily upset about the fact that Edwards had a pregnant mistress. Instead she was more bothered that it was her money being used to pay for it.

'She thought maybe you should probably pay for your girlfriend yourself,' he said in court, prompting an outburst of laughter- even from Edwards himself.

Mr Huffman was involved in the case directly, as he helped write the checks that totalled $725,000 and helped cover their tracks by calling them part of a fledgling (faux) furniture business.

The monetary requests and transfers between the Edwards camp and Ms Mellon have been occupying much of the trial, and one previous session revealed that the elderly heiress was 'apoplectic' when asked to donate $50million for a Edwards-intiated poverty foundation at one point.
