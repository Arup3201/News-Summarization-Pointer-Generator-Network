Real life superhero: Luke Junior, 24, who detained a shoplifter in Sheffield, South Yorkshire

The suspected thief fleeing a frozen food store with £10 worth of bacon was hardly in the arch-villain class.

But that did not deter Superman from swooping into action.

The Man of Steel, alias security guard Luke Junior, was wearing his red-and-blue caped outfit as part of an outdoor charity family fun day, with stalls and games for children.

When he saw staff chasing the shoplifter from the store, he grabbed the man, swiftly placed him in an armlock and held him until two policewomen arrived to arrest him.

As they marched the offender away in handcuffs, Superman was given a round of applause by onlookers while the movie’s theme tune was played over loudspeakers by the DJ who was hosting the event in Sheffield – coincidentally the City of Steel.

The drama unfolded as 24-year-old Mr Junior was helping the Gleadless Valley Community Action Group raise money for a skate park.

A Superman fanatic, he imported the £500 costume from Argentina and is a regular figure at charity events in South Yorkshire.

As he chatted with members of the public outside a Cash Converters shop, the 38-year-old thief emerged from Heron Foods pursued by the manager and others. He has since admitted theft of seven packs of bacon and is awaiting sentence.

Recalling the citizen’s arrest, Mr Junior said: ‘The last thing you want to do is run straight into Superman. He was going nowhere but the police station.

‘I saw the manager chasing him and I felt I had to physically restrain him and make a citizen’s arrest. I wouldn’t advise everybody to do it because it can be dangerous and it’s not something to take on lightly.

‘I had to pin him up against the window of the Cash Converters store. I had his arm up his back and I wasn’t letting him go.

‘There was a bit of adrenaline and I 
did it without thinking too much, but when that stopped I realised I was
 still dressed as Superman. I’ve not lived it down since it happened.’

He said the police officers ‘didn’t even crack a smile’ but families 
involved in the charity event were cheering and clapping the real-life 
superhero.

Mr Junior has a ferret called Kal-El –
 Superman’s Kryptonian name – and a girlfriend named not Lois Lane but 
Charlotte Smith.

He works as a shopping centre security guard but has 
ambitions to become a fireman.

He has already staked his claim to 
hero status after a crash eight years ago when he dragged two ‘boy 
racers’ out of their car following a collision.

‘I’m waiting until the 
fire service can recruit again and then I want to save people,’ he said.

‘The main priority was protecting kids
 and the public. When I was younger I always said I wanted to be some 
sort of Superman and the things I’m doing at the moment it’s like I 
already am.’

Karen Bayliss, assistant manager at 
Heron Foods, said: ‘A sales assistant and the manager needed some help 
and Superman came along.

‘We’ve got a hotline now to Superman in case there’s any more trouble.’
