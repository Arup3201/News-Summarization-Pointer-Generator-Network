Michel du Cille and his wife, Nikki Kahn, were scheduled to take part in sessions to review students' portfolios at the Newhouse School of Public Communications.

The decision to prevent the photojournalists from attending was allegedly made after a student at the school researched Mr Du Cille and raised concern having seen he was recently in Liberia. 

Mr du Cille told The Washington Post: 'It’s a disappointment to me. I’m p***** off and embarrassed and completely weirded out that a journalism institution that should be seeking out facts and details is basically pandering to hysteria.'

MailOnline had reached out to the school and was awaiting comment.  

As for the family who recently returned to Georgia from West Africa, school officials told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution they had a letter from CARE to say they had passed more than 21 days - the period when Ebola can develop - but that the school district needed proof from a local health authority or CDC.

MailOnline was awaiting comment from the Dekalb school district on Friday however a spokesman said earlier that the family 'understands' the decision.

It is not clear that an Ebola incident was suspected on Thursday in Manhattan - but emergency responders arrived in full hazmat suits.

While the two incidents appeared to be over-reactions to Ebola, they joined a growing number of potential virus reports across the U.S. 

The Pentagon police today shut down a building entrance and a portion of the south parking lot because a woman was sick and told emergency personnel that she had recently been to West Africa, officials said.

Arlington County, Virginia responded with a HazMat team and was treating it as a possible Ebola case. She was taken to a local hospital, county officials said.

Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Crosson said that out of an abundance of caution, all pedestrian and vehicle traffic was stopped across 17 lanes of the huge parking lot. A building entrance and parking lanes are temporarily closed, he said.

In New York City on Thursday, emergency responders wheeled a patient into an ambulance on the Upper East Side wearing full hazmat suits and facemasks,WPIX reported. 

It is not clear if Ebola was suspected or if the city had recommended the measures out of an abundance of caution.

Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut evaluated a patient with 'Ebola-like symptoms' on Wednesday. 

However the following day, preliminary tests showed that the Yale University graduate student did not have the disease.

The patient is one of two Yale epidemiology students who traveled to Liberia last month to advise the health ministry on using computers to track Ebola.

A female prisoner in Virginia, who traveled to West Africa in recent weeks, was taken to Inova Loudon Hospital on Thursday after developing a fever.  

She was being tested but officials say there's a 'very low probability' she has the deadly virus.

In California, Southwestern College was cordoned off for a few hours on Thursday following the news that a student had been on the same flight as Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Jay Vinson - and her younger sister has since vomited. 

There are currently four Americans being treated for Ebola in the United States. 

NBC News freelancer Ashoka Mukpo, 33,  is being treated at University of Nebraska Medical Center in Lincoln. 

Nurse Amber Vinson, 29,  is at Emory University Hospital, along with an American World Health Organization doctor, who has not been identified, who contracted the disease while working in Sierre Leone.

Nurse Nina Pham , 26, is being treated at the National Institutes for Health in Maryland. 

According to World Health Organization guidelines, Ebola is not an air-borne virus.

It is only spread through direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials (e.g. bedding, clothing) contaminated with these fluids.
