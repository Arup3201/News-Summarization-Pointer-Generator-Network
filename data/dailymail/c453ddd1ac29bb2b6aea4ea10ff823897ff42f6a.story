A mother-of-three abandoned her young children - including a baby - to go on a six-hour drinking binge, a court heard.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left the youngsters at the family home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire at 10pm telling them she was going to buy cigarettes.

But in the early hours of the morning she was arrested for being drunk and disorderly, 15 miles away in Leeds.

The woman was arrested after a six hour drinking binge in Leeds, pictured, in West Yorkshire. She had left her three young children, all 12 and under, at home alone in Huddersfield

Prosecutor Alex Bosman told Kirklees Magistrates Court that the 30-year-old woman left her home on December 14, telling her eldest child that she was going to get cigarettes.

But the 12-year-old child didn’t believe her because she was ‘all dressed up’.

The court heard it wasn’t until 4am the following morning that the woman was arrested for being drunk.

She then raised concern with police for her children’s welfare.

Mr Bosman said: 'Police carried out a welfare check at her address. The two eldest were asleep on the living room floor and the baby was asleep upstairs on the bedroom floor.'

The court heard at first the woman told police her husband had been due home but he did not confirm her story.

She pleaded guilty to the charge of willfully neglecting and abandoning her children in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health.

The court heard social services were now involved with the family.

Defence solicitor Paul Normandale said: 'This defendant does understand the seriousness of what she did.'

He told the court one of the woman’s children is disabled and a custodial sentence would have a ‘catastrophic effect’ on her and the family.

Magistrate John Scott told the defendant: 'This was something which could have been disastrous.'

He sentenced the woman to an 18-month community order with 18 months’ supervision and a 50 day activity requirement.

He also ordered a £60 victim surcharge to be paid.
