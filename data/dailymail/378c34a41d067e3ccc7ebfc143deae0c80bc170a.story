A judge fined a company ‘every penny it has’ after bosses admitted the corporate manslaughter of an 11-year-old girl killed  when she was flung from a banana boat.

Mari-Simon Cronje died when she was struck by a speedboat that was towing the inflatable at a friend’s birthday party.

Fining Princes Sporting Club nearly £35,000, Judge Alistair McCreath said: 'I propose to fine this company every penny that it has. I have no power to do anything other than impose a fine and I can impose no greater fine than all of its assets.’

Killed: Mari-Simon Cronje died during a birthday celebration in September 2010 after she fell from the banana boat. The Prince's Sporting Club in Bedfont, west London, pleaded guilty to corporate manslaughter today

It was also ordered to pay £100,000 in costs donated by the owner William Bottriell.

The club pleaded guilty to the charge at Southwark Crown Court, in London. Company director Frederick Glen Walker was cleared of any offences after the Crown Prosecution Service dropped charges against him.

Southwark Crown Court heard that there were several health and safety failings with the club at the time of the incident.

Mari-Simon's father, UBS Wealth Management chief executive Andries Cronje, told in a statement read out in Southwark Crown Court of his heartache at his daughter's tragic death.

He said: 'Our 11 year-old daughter Mari-Simon Cronje died prematurely on September 11th, 2010.

'A promising life stretched ahead of her and she touched the hearts of everyone who knew her.

'Her death has left an unimaginable void in our lives.

'She died as a result of a catalogue of errors, all of which could have been prevented by competent management.'

He said he was 'deeply disappointed' 
by the club and boat driver, who he accused of 'trying to avoid taking 
responsibility for the substandard way' the activities were carried out.

Calling
for tighter regulations, he added: 'We do not wish the past three years
on any parent and today's events bring no closure or consolation. 

'However, we are hoping that changes in the law will prevent something like this from happening again.'

He held hands with his wife, Ancia as he sat during the hearing.

The
driver, New Zealander Matthew Gibson, had no UK-recognised 
qualification despite having five years’ experience as a ski-boat 
driver.

Staff said 
there was a 'lax' attitude to health and safety, and several former 
employees and customers reported there being no 'spotter' on the boat to
warn a driver if somebody fell in.

The
court heard factors which contributed to the girl’s death included the 
lack of an observer on the boat at the time of the incident, the speed 
of the boat, it’s 'unnecessary' turning at tight angles, and the colour 
of the equipment the children were wearing - making it difficult to spot
them if they fell in the water.

Parents of some of the children were watching from picnic tables when Mari-Simon fell into the water.

Two of the witnesses leapt into the river after failing to get Mr Gibson’s attention. The driver later told police he did not see the girl fall in.

He said: 'I turned the boat around and she went under.' The court heard the 11-year-old was later pronounced dead.

'Changes in the law': Andries and Ancia Cronje gave a statement to the press outside Southwark Crown Court. Mr Cronje said 'Our 11-year-old daughter died prematurely. A promising life stretched out ahead of her'

Summing up, Judge Alistair McCreath said: 'The first thing that obviously must be said in this very unhappy case is a word of sympathy and a word of acknowledgment of the dreadful grief and terrible loss suffered by those who loved Mari-Simon. And of them there were plenty.'

He said that if the company was still solvent he would have slapped it with a bigger fine that would have led to its closure.

The judge criticised the company for not having a spotter on board, saying it was 'absolutely obvious' one was needed, and said the case was a particularly serious example of corporate manslaughter.

The firm was guilty of 'persistent and deliberate failures to provide observers', he added.

Closed: The Prince's Club closed its doors after the death of 11-year-old Mari-Simon Cronje. It was ordered to pay £134,579.69 - all the money in the firm's accounts and another £100,000 donated by owner, William Bottriell

Praising the 'dignified and deeply, deeply touching' statement of her father, he said the fine in no way reflected the value of Mari-Simon's life.

The club had originally denied committing corporate manslaughter but later changed their plea to guilty.

The club's director Mr Walker also denied a charge of neglect by a director, which accuses him of responsibility for the alleged health and safety failures which led to Mari-Simon's death.

No action was taken by the prosecution and a not guilty verdict was issued by the judge.
