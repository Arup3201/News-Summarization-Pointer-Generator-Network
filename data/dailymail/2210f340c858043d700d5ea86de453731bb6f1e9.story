Victims of Bernard Madoff's fraud will soon receive $2.48 billion to help cover their losses.

The payout more than triples their total recovery to about $3.63 billion, but is still only half of what was lost, the trustee liquidating the imprisoned swindler's firm said.

Checks ranging from $1,784 to $526.9 million were mailed on Wednesday to 1,230 former customers of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, according to trustee Irving Picard.

The average payout is $2.02 million.

Madoff's victims earlier recovered 
$1.15 billion, including sums committed by the Securities Investor 
Protection Corp, which helps customers of failed brokerages.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland 
in Manhattan authorized the latest distribution last month following two
legal victories for the trustee.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court decision that endorsed Picard's methods for calculating losses.

In
July, a former Madoff customer dropped a court challenge to a $7.2 
billion forfeiture by the estate of Madoff investor Jeffry Picower.

Of 
that sum, $5 billion would go to the Madoff firm's estate, and the rest 
to the U.S. government.

Picard has recovered $9.15 billion, or 53 per cent of the $17.3 billion he believes was lost in Madoff's Ponzi scheme.

The trustee is holding some funds in reserve as some Madoff victims pursue their own cases to recover more money.

Picard said this litigation is delaying further distributions.

The
trustee is also appealing court decisions that have limited his claims 
against banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co that did business with 
Madoff.

A spokeswoman for Picard was not immediately available to comment on the latest distribution.

The
market for trading claims on potential recoveries from Madoff's estate 
will adjust for the distribution, according to Joseph Sarachek.

Sarachek is the managing director of claims trading at CRT Capital Group LLC, a Stamford, Connecticut-based broker-dealer.

He said claims that recently traded at around 69 cents on the dollar will likely soon trade in the 30s. 'The Madoff market is fairly volatile,' Sarachek said.

'The real question is when people think the next distribution will be.'

Lifland has authorized Picard and his law firm, Baker & Hostetler, to bill $321.2 million of legal fees to pursue Madoff cases for the period ended January 31, 2012.

Mark Madoff, one of Bernard Madoff's sons, was found dead on Saturday, Dec. 11, 2010 having committed suicide at an apartment that is now up for rent

Madoff was arrested in December 2008 and pleaded guilty three months later.

The 74-year-old is serving a 150-year sentence in a North Carolina federal prison.

Madoff used his London trading operation to try to cover up his 20-year deception and wired millions to and from his Mayfair-based subsidiary in a money laundering operation to make it look as though he was investing in European markets.

He solicited billions from customers around the world under the pretence that it was being invested in securities.

In reality, he was simply depositing the money straight into a number of bank accounts.

The con was exposed in December 2010, after the financial meltdown meant many of his investors demanded their money back, but couldn't get it.

He claimed he was holding $76billion worth of investors' money. In reality, his assets had dwindled to a fraction of that.

As the charges against Madoff senior 
unraveled his son, Mark, physically and mentally changed, his wife 
Stephanie told People magazine.

Devastated by the allegations, Mark hung himself in his New York apartment in on December 11.

That
property was put onto the rental market earlier this week, with a price
ticket of $35,000-per-month, but it might not be there long.
