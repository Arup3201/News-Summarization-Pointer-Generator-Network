A father discovered his only son had died in a car accident after he first tried to text and then called the 18-year-old's cell phone - which was eventually answered by a cop at the scene of the crash.

Johnathan Leonard, 18, was a backseat passenger in a vehicle which crashed on the outskirts of Lexington, North Carolina just three days before Thanksgiving.

The accident happened less than a mile from Leonard's home and the boy's father Jeffrey had desperately tried to contact his son after hearing about the crash to check that he wasn't involved.

After hearing about the crash Jeffrey Leonard texted his son to check that he was okay 

'It's like a nightmare you don't wake up from,' Jeffrey Leonard told WFMY about the death of his only child.

His son Johnathan was one of four teenagers driving home from North Davidson County High School when 16-year-old driver Jordan Deal's 1988 Toyota car veered off the road, hit several  trees and flipped over. He was over the speed limit at the time.

Backseat passengers Leonard, 18, and Kayleigh Campbell, 15, were both killed instantly.

Campbell's older brother, Denzel Caige Campbell, 17, was in the front passenger seat and remains in hospital with critical injuries. Driver Deal suffered only minor injuries and is out of hospital.

The crash occurred close to Johnathan Leonard's home and he and his father Jeffrey had been texting just prior to the accident.

After hearing about the crash Jeffrey Leonard texted his son to check that he was okay. 

When Jeffrey Leonard didn't hear back from his son his sent another text urging him to let him know that he was alright

The accident happened less than a mile from Johnathan Leonard's home and the boy's father Jeffrey had desperately tried to contact his son after hearing about the crash to check that he wasn't involved.

‘Where are you?’ read the first message. 

Three minutes later, he sent another message: ‘John answer me right now. There has been a very serious car wreck below the church... air care is here now... I want to know it isn't you.’

After getting no response, Jeffrey Leonard called his son, and after the second call a police officer picked up the phone and told him the terrible news about his son.

‘In reading the texts, I could tell the father knew something was wrong,’ Sgt. R.C. Abernathy of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol told PEOPLE. 

‘I picked up more or less to ease the father's pain of the unknowing.’  

Crash scene: Driver Deal allegedly told the police he was driving with the window down and his hair blew in his face, which caused him to miss a turn in the road

Deal has been charged with two counts of misdemeanor death by motor vehicle, careless and reckless driving, a seatbelt violation (because Kayleigh Campbell wasn't wearing a seat belt) and a limited provisional license violation – because North Carolina law states that 16-year-old drivers cannot have more than one unrelated passenger in their car.

He is due in court in January to face the charges against him, which are all misdemeanors.

Deal allegedly told police that he was driving with the window down and his hair blew in his face, which caused him to miss a turn in the road.

According to WFMY, neither grieving family is blaming Deal for the crash, instead calling it a tragic accident and asking the public to pray for all involved.

Bambi Torrence, a friend of Kayleigh and Caige's mother, said she was ‘holding up, the best she can’ since the accident.
