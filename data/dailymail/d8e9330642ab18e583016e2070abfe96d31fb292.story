A four-year-old California boy has survived being thrown 20 feet from his car seat with just minor scrapes in what his mother hasÂ  called a 'miracle.'

Elisa Miranda and the boy's father were driving along the Interstate 5 in Anaheim around 8:15pm Thursday when he lost control while swerving to avoid tire tread on the road and hit a concrete wall.

Miranda's son Angel was thrown through the shattered back window of the SUV and landed 20 feet away in a tiny clump of vegetation - the only cushioned spot nearby.

'[There was] a bed of ice plant there, and anywhere north of that or south of that it's all concrete,' California Highway Patrol (CHP) officer Troy Christensen told KTLA.

'One in a million. It's something that you go through your whole career and never see,' he said.

Miranda says that after their car came to a stop she turned around and realized her son was not in the backseat.

'I was screaming "Angel, Angel where's my son?"' she told KTLA.

'I was scared that my son would be dead.'

Angel was ejected from the car, flying 20 feet through the air before landing in a lone soft patch of ice plants by the side of the road.

Miranda told KTLA that her son had been buckled into a booster chair. CHP is investigating if the device was fitted properly.

Angel was treated for minor cuts and scrapes at the UC-Irvine Medical Center and released Friday.

His mother says the only way to describe his survival is that is is a 'miracle.'

'He has a big angel next to him,' she said.
