Peter Clarke had food poisoning caused by campylobacter bacteria

Peter
 Clarke had invited his 19-year-old grandson, Cai, over for a meal and 
had made a special effort with the menu, starting with home-made 
vegetable soup, which was followed by roast chicken breast with new 
potatoes and peas, then chocolate mousse.

'I see quite a bit of Cai 
because he studies at university in Cardiff, which is where I live,' 
says  79-year-old Peter, a retired consultant structural engineer who 
lives alone. 'I enjoy cooking when it's not just for me.'

But that 
night in February left Peter with a nasty stomach bug that kept him 
housebound for nearly a week and led to him losing 9lb in just a few 
days.

He had contracted a campylobacter infection - and is thought to have caught it when he washed the chicken before cooking it.

It was something he, like nearly half of the population, had always done, little realising how risky it could be for health.

Yesterday
 the Food Standards Agency  (FSA) warned people to stop washing chicken 
before they cook it because of the risk of spreading the deadly 
bacteria.

Campylobacter bacteria are the most common cause of food 
poisoning in the UK, affecting an estimated 280,000 Britons a year - and
 are to blame for more cases than E.coli, salmonella and listeria put 
together.

'Often people don't report their symptoms, so the true 
number of cases is likely to be even higher,' says Bob Martin, a 
microbiologist and head of food-borne diseases strategy at the FSA.

Around
 80 per cent of these cases have been traced to contaminated poultry - 
it's thought that two‑thirds of chicken carries the bacteria, says  Mr 
Martin.

Laboratory tests on samples from infected people have found 
they contain the same campylobacter DNA found specifically in chicken. 
Other sources of the bacteria include raw meat, unpasteurised milk and 
untreated water.

Campylobacter is said to never be more than 3ft from
 a chicken shed, he says, adding that the FSA is working with the 
poultry supply industry in the UK to reduce the amount of the bacteria 
on chicken. But a key problem is that many of us are unwittingly 
spreading it by washing raw chicken.

As many as 44 per cent of 
people always wash chicken before cooking it, according to the FSA - 
usually because they think it gets rid of germs or the blood.

Washing
 raw chicken seems to be something you either do or don't do, 'perhaps 
depending if your parents did it', adds Dr Katie Laird, a microbiologist
 at De Montfort University in Leicester.

Caught common food poisoning bug after washing a chicken before cooking it

The problem is that 
droplets of water carrying campylobacter, and other bugs such as 
salmonella, can splash onto hands, work surfaces, sinks, clothing, 
cooking equipment such as chopping boards, sponges and cloths - and even
 other food that isn't then cooked, such as salad.

'We know the droplets from  washing chicken under a kitchen  tap can travel up to a metre,' says Mr Martin.

And just a few campylobacter cells are needed to cause disease and food poisoning, adds Dr Laird.

This
 won't occur as soon as you've eaten the contaminated foods - it can 
take between one and five days before you start feeling unwell. The 
symptoms are caused when the bacteria reach the 
epithelial cells that line the stomach - 'they have a toxic effect in us
 which triggers inflammation, and that causes symptoms,' explains Dr 
Laird.

In around half of the cases, the illness starts with 24-hour 
flu-like symptoms. It progresses to profuse diarrhoea that can contain 
blood, vomiting, abdominal pains and cramps that may resemble 
appendicitis. Typically, it lasts around a week.

'It is a severe illness that you don't get over after a day,' adds Mr Martin.

Drinking
 water helps, as this replaces the fluids lost through vomiting and 
diarrhoea - the body's ability to fight the bug is compromised if it is 
dehydrated.

The worry is that in around a quarter of patients, the 
bacteria can trigger a number of conditions, such as irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS).

'This is due to an irreversible change in the lining of the gut,' says  Mr Martin. This can last for years in some cases.

One possible cause is a toxin produced by the bacteria - research has shown this can disrupt bowel function.

The
 infection may also damage nerves lining the gut, responsible for gut 
motility (the normal movement of waste through the system) and 
sensation, leading to altered bowel movements and increased awareness of
 pain in the gastro-intestinal tract.

In around 1 per cent of cases, 
campylobacter can trigger 'reactive' arthritis, which is usually short 
term but can sometimes become chronic, says Mr Martin.

Here, inflammation - redness and swelling - are triggered in response to an infection.

This
 most commonly affects the joints (leading to pain and stiffness), the 
eyes (causing conjunctivitis) and the urethra (leading to pain when 
urinating).

The joint pain typically comes on two to four weeks after the infection has passed.

Another more alarming condition, Guillain-Barre  syndrome, is strongly linked to campylo- bacter.Although
 rare, it usually occurs after a viral or bacterial infection, which may
 trigger the immune system to attack nerve roots and peripheral nerves, 
causing partial paralysis and sometimes even death. Around 1,200 people a
 year suffer from it.

While anyone can get campylobacter food 
poisoning or the serious complications, the under-fives and over-60s are
 at a slightly increased risk because their immune systems tend to be 
weaker, says Mr Martin.

There is no reason to clean chicken or wash off visible blood - it doesn't make it any more hygienic

Taking medications that affect production of stomach acid can also make you more vulnerable to a campylobacter infection.

For
 instance, those taking proton pump inhibitors, which reduce the 
production of stomach acid, might be more susceptible because the acid 
in the stomach can kill the bacteria.

Usually drinking lots of water
 and taking oral rehydration salts to avoid dehydration, resting and 
eating easily digested foods if you feel up to it is enough to treat a 
campylobacter infection. Antibiotics may be prescribed if symptoms are 
severe.

If the symptoms last more than a couple of days or are 
particularly severe, such as blood being present in the stools, see your
 GP or call the 111 helpline if you're worried about leaving the house, 
adds Mr Martin.  

The consequences of washing chicken were not 
immediate for Peter Clarke. He started feeling 'vaguely unwell' three 
days later; his grandson Cai didn't become ill, possibly because the 
bacteria only splashed onto Peter's food or hands.

Peter woke that 
morning with an upset tummy. For the next four days, he was rushing to 
the lavatory so was stuck indoors and didn't feel like eating.

He 
decided to chance leaving the house to see his GP, who prescribed a 
medicine to stop the diarrhoea. By the following day he had started to 
improve.

His doctor asked Peter to give a stool sample - standard 
practice for anyone with severe symptoms - which was then tested and 
found to contain campylobacter.

Environmental Health contacted Peter
 to try to determine the source of the bacteria - this usually happens 
only when it's thought the cause might be linked to an establishment 
that sells food.

'Someone mentioned raw chicken and asked if I'd 
washed it,' explains Peter, who was back to full strength a couple of 
weeks later. 'Because I hadn't been out to eat, it was the most obvious 
cause. I was surprised something so routine was to blame. I stayed in 
bed most of the time, as I felt so rotten.

'There should be notices on chicken telling people not to wash it because most don't realise.

'What
 happened has made me wonder what goes on in kitchens, and I prefer 
eating out at places where I can see the food being prepared. I haven't 
eaten chicken since, but I certainly won't wash it again.'

For days Peter was rushing to the lavatory so was stuck indoors and didn't feel like eating

There
 are steps consumers can take to protect themselves from campylobacter, 
says microbiologist Bob Martin, from the Food Standards Agency:

@highlight

Peter Clarke, 79, from Cardiff had a nasty stomach bug in February

@highlight

It followed a chicken meal, and kept him housebound for nearly a week

@highlight

Contracted a campylobacter infection - common cause of food poisoning

@highlight

Thought to have caught it when he washed the chicken before cooking it

@highlight

Don't wash raw chicken. There is no reason to clean chicken or wash off 
visible blood - it doesn't make it any more hygienic or remove bugs.

@highlight

Use separate chopping  boards for chicken and other ingredients, such as salad  and vegetables.

@highlight

Disinfect surfaces, dishcloths, sponges and utensils that raw chicken 
has come into contact with to avoid spreading the bacteria around the 
kitchen. 

@highlight

When possible, clean them in the dishwasher, as the 
combination of heat, water and detergent kills the bugs. Clean work 
surfaces or other items with hot water and an anti-microbial 
disinfectant, such as a bleach spray.

@highlight

 Make sure the chicken is 
cooked properly - either by checking with a temperature probe that it's 
70c or by making sure the meat isn't pink - and that the juices running 
out of it are clear
