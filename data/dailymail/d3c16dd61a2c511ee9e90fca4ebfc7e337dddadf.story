Tragedy: Stephen Brookes, 29, who died after downing a pint of vodka after taking on a NekNominate challenge

A rugby fan died after downing almost a bottle of vodka during a NekNominate challenge, an inquest heard today.

Stephen Brookes, 29, was six-times over the drink-drive limit when he collapsed after drinking more than a pint of the spirit 'in seconds' while being filmed by a friend.

His distraught family said today he would still be alive today but for the NekNominate craze, which has claimed at least five lives in the past year.

An inquest heard how Mr Brookes died after a night out with friends having watched Wales play Ireland in the Six Nations.

Later he was dared to down vodka by friends as a crowd gathered to watch him.

The inquest heard the labourer told them he would be 'OK' just before performing the stunt, but within minutes he had collapsed and could not be revived.

Cousin Jodie Cummings told police: 'Stephen had been watching a rugby match with friends at a house. He had taken a 75cl bottle of vodka.

'A few weeks ago he had been NekNominated. This is something where somebody nominates a friend to down something like a bottle or a pint.

'After midnight when I was in the bathroom, Stephen down the bottle of vodka.

'It was filmed and I saw it on a friend's phone. I saw him neck back the bottle of vodka. He just held the bottle in the air.

'Afterwards he was in good spirits and said: "You know me".

'He was dancing around. But ten minutes later his balance has gone. He was slurring his words - it all happened so quickly.'

Friends told police how people were encouraging Stephen to down the vodka at around 1am in February - the day after he had watched Wales play Ireland in the Six Nations rugby.

Another friend Shaun Chivers said the vodka went 'within seconds' as he was filmed in the party near his home in Rumney, Cardiff.

He said: 'I saw Stephen had three quarters of the bottle left and I knew he was going to neck it.

'I said: "Stop effing around Brookes" But the next thing he necked the bottle and it was gone in seconds.

'Soon after he was swaying all over the place.'

Bereft: Mr Brookes collapsed after being filmed by a friend and his devastated family have said he would be alive if it wasn't for the craze

The Cardiff inquest heard how Stephen was taken home by friends and was put to bed.

But he died within an hour of the NekNominate stunt after falling unconscious. His friends called an ambulance but he couldn't be revived.

He was almost six times the legal drink-drive legal limit. He had 458 millilitres of alcohol in his blood - the drink-drive limit is 80.

He also had a high level of cocaine in his blood and had taken between ten and twenty lines of cocaine.

Pathologist Thomas Hockey said he was clearly 'well over' the fatal range for alcohol.

He said: 'Most likely in this case is the alcohol causing the depression of his respiratory function and greatly slows down breathing.'

Deputy coroner Christopher Woolley said: 'Stephen went to a party and had been drinking throughout the afternoon.

'He had drunk half a bottle of vodka and several cans of cider.

'At 1am it appears he drank a considerable quantity of alcohol - three quarters of a bottle of vodka in a NekNomination game.

'The idea is that the person is videoed and that is posted on Facebook.

'He very clearly deteriorated and was manhandled into a car. He was carried into his flat by friends.

'He was struggling to breathe and an ambulance was called. CPR was given to Stephen but one friend says he thinks he was already dead.'

He recorded a verdict of death by acute alcohol poisoning and cocaine use.

Speaking after the inquest, family spokeswoman aunt Christine Beresford said: 'He would still be alive if he wasn't playing this game.

'NekNominate obviously got out of hand. Young ones need to know the dangers of drinking. Stephen should still be here - it is a very dangerous game.

'He was loved by his friends and family. He always loved making somebody smile.'
