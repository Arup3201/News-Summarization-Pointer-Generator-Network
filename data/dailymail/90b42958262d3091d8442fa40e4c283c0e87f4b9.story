Who's hungry?

A Florida man faces criminal charges after he allegedly posted photos on Facebook of him posing with several dead wild turkeys.

But if that doesn't gross you out, this might: 27-year-old Travis McFatter also allegedly posed with a road-kill alligator, which he found on a highway, then took back to his house, butchered and ate.

'Mr. McFatter also explained he picked up the road-killed alligator near
his house,' Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Investigator Todd Hoyle told Jax.com. 'He took the gator home, 
snapped a few photos and ate the meat.'

The photos were posted on Facebook, where McFatter also has photos of him posing with the turkeys, deer, several rodents and fish.

According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, a hunter is allowed to kill two birds during Turkey season and no more than one on a single day. McFatter, however, admitted to police that he's killed five turkeys this season, including two in one day.

Authorities caught wind of McFatter's kills when someone anonymously tipped them off after viewing the carnage on McFatter's Facebook page.

Also featured on McFatter's Facebook page is his friend Blake King, who also is seen posing with dead turkeys.

Mcfatter, King and another friend, 26-year-old Dustin Parish, all were cited by the FWC. Another friend, 20-year-old Zachary Espenship, was cited for allegedly killing a deer as it stood on the side of the road blinded by the headlights on his truck

“Mr. King gave permission to search his truck and investigators found fresh blood in the bed and on the tailgate of his pickup,” Hoyle says. “He told us that he and his friend, Mr. Espenship, were headed home from their hunting club and saw a deer standing on the shoulder of the road. Mr. Espenship then shot the deer.”    In all, the investigation led to 13 misdemeanors and two infractions
