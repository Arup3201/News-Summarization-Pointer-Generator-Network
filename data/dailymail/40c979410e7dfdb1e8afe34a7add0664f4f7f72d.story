Inter Milan are set for a busy January as they close in on moves for attacking duo Ezequiel Lavezzi and Lukas Podolski.

Italian journal La Gazzetta dello Sport report that Lavezzi is all that is missing from the Serie A side amid rumours that boss Roberto Mancini is interested in the Paris Saint-Germain striker. 

A hot topic in Corriere dello Sport is that a deal between Arsenal's Lukas Podolski and Inter is 'done' as the forward struggles to cement a place in Arsene Wenger's first team.

Over in Spain, Sport are quoting La Liga hopefuls Barcelona as they remain convinced they 'will win this league.'

Technical staff at the Nou Camp are choosing to block out any negative critics as they trail leaders and fierce rivals Real Madrid by a single point. 

With Luis Enrique's men hot on their tails, Real Madrid pleased fans as they took to the training ground in front of a packed Alfredo di Stefano stadium.

A short ride from the coliseum that is the Santiago Bernabeu, the 6,000 seater stadium opened its doors to the public.

As Carlo Ancelotti's side performed for a 'happy Madrid' they were treated to 'saves from (Iker) Casillas and a wonder strike from Isco.'

Finally, Marca celebrates 'a success story' as Fernando Torres is confirmed as an Atletico Madrid player.
