A college student looking for 15 seconds of fame during a Weather Channel live broadcast got far more than than he bargained for when meteorologist Jim Cantore swiftly kicked him in the groin.

Cantore was broadcasting from the snow-covered College of Charleston in South Carolina on Tuesday night when he spotted his assailant running at him from out of the corner of his eye.

The student - emitting a convincing battle cry - ran towards Cantore, 49, and tried to jump on him, but was instead met with the force of Cantore's knee in his crotch.

See below for video

Incoming: The Weather Channel's Jim Cantore coolly lifted a knee when he saw a videobomber run towards him during a live broadcast from South Carolina's College of Charleston on Tuesday night

Ouch: The college student didn't know what hit him as Cantore's knee went straight into his groin

Cantore stayed remarkably cool throughout the incident and continued talking as he shrugged off his attacker.

The student could do nothing but run away - this time silently.

'Obviously, here at the College of Charleston they are already having a good time,' Cantore quipped.

The video quickly became an internet hit, with thousands applauding Cantore for his quick work.

But Cantore wasn't so impressed with the situation.

Pained: The man is filled with regret as Cantore removes his knee and continues the broadcast

'Honestly it happens more than you think, ' he told MSNBC'S Thomas Roberts. 'I'm sick of it.

'Do
 I come up to somebody in their office and scream and yell at them as 
they're doing their work? No. This is my office out here so get out of 
my space, get out of my face, don't touch me.'

But he said that his practice at dealing with the video bombers made him prepared this time around.

'I
 caught him coming out of the corner of my eye and I thought, "you know 
what, I'm not just going to stand here",' he said.

See ya: Cantore shrugs off the man, who silently runs away following the unexpected response

Not so brave now: The video has become an internet hit - but Cantore said he was fed up of people thinking they could interrupt and touch him while he was in his place of work

'"They're gonna feel 
this, they're going to remember this one". It worked out.'

Cantore, a father of two, has been dubbed the 'Rock Star
 of Meteorologists' for his commitment to covering the nation's 
strongest hurricanes and blizzards - and now for taking on video bombers.

He has worked for The Weather Channel ever since he graduated college in 1986.
