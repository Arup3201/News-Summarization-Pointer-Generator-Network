 A computer games fanatic battled his way to a new world record by playing 'Call of Duty: Black Ops 2' - for more than five-and-a-half days.

Determined Okan Kaya, 28, played the hit game for a total of 135 hours and 50 minutes.

Okan, of Sydney, Australia, smashed the previous record for continuous gaming which stood at 120 hours and seven minutes.

Okan wanted to smash the previous record for continuous gaming which stood at 120 hours and seven minute

The record breaker was allowed ten minute breaks every hour during the course of game

He began his epic session on Tuesday and was allowed to take a ten minute break every hour and kept his energy up with sports drinks and light meals.

Okan, a sales manager for online retailer 4Cabling, said: 'My hands were cramping up and I went through a lot of bandages. I even tried to 'pad up' my controller.'

Guinness allowed the breaks to be stored up and taken at once so Okan was able to sleep for several hours at a time.

Earlier this year a Taiwanese teenager died during a marathon 40-hour session of Diablo 3.

An incredible eight million copies of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 were sold on its opening day last week - netting publishers Activision £300 million.

The game now also hold the records for the most money generated in a day for any entertainment release - including the Harry Potter and Star Wars film releases.
