An Australian woman who allegedly sold fake ultrasound photos to pregnant mothers is now facing numerous charges of deception.

Scores of mothers-to-be cherished the images that had allegedly been printed of the babies they were carrying in the womb, but concerns grew when the women realised that others had been provided with the same pictures.

Now a West Australian woman in the town of Bunbury, running a business called ‘Amazing 4D Imagining’, has been charged with making false and misleading representations to consumers.

A woman in West Australia has been charged after she allegedly supplied dozens of expectant mothers with fake 4D ultrasound photos

The un-named woman is alleged to have provided pregnant women with pictures of babies in the womb and claimed they were the same images that the mothers-to-be had seen on the ultrasound screen.

But, it will be alleged, the photos the mothers-to-be were given - and cherished - had been downloaded from the internet.

The ABC reported on Monday that West Australia’s Department of Commerce had received dozens of complaints.

‘We had an unprecedented 76 actual written complaints in relation to that issue,’ said Ms Debbie Butler of Consumer Protection.

Dozens of expectant mothers claim to have received the same pictures and are devastated they had been misled

The Bunbury Mail reported earlier this year that more than 100 people had joined a group set up for people who believed they had been given false ultrasound photos of their unborn children.

The paper said that the issue had first come to light when a Bunbury woman posted her concerns on Facebook - which resulted in numerous other women coming forward. 

One mother, Catherine Osment, was said to have paid for an ultrasound DVD and photographs of her unborn baby, attending a private 4D ultrasound home business, but when she received her photographs she said it was ‘clearly obvious’ all eight images were of different babies

‘I knew as soon as I opened them they were fake and it made me feel sick,’ she said.

She added that when she searched the internet she found the same photographs in Google Images. Further checks revealed that the prints had been made before she had had her scan.

Women shared images on Facebook to compare the pictures, finding many of them had duplicates

Her partner, she revealed, had even been planning to have the baby’s image tattooed on his chest, but he cancelled the appointment when he realised the photo might not be of his child.

A second mother, Jacinta Langford, said she believed an ultrasound photos of her twins had been lifted from Google Images.

The Bunbury paper reported the business owner, who could not be named for legal reasons, said she was considering legal action for what she said were defamatory claims, adding that her work was legitimate and professional.

Women writing in response to the allegations expressed their horror and dismay with one commenting: ‘What a terrible thing to do to people.’

Another wrote: ‘OMG, this is absolutely horrible. I could only image the heartbreak these mothers must be feeling, having 2 kids of my own. My heart goes out to them.’

Yet another commentator wrote that it was ‘heartbreaking watching these parents put "their" little images up…and other parents are saying and posting “their” own images EXACTLY THE SAME…it is a disgusting betrayal of trust.’

Others took to Facebook to share and compare images they believed to be duplicates of their own, and pictures which they all believed showed their own children. 

The charged woman is due to appear before Bunbury Magistrates Court on January 12.
