Developers have been waiting months to get their hands on the next-generation Oculus Rift - and now a teardown has revealed what's inside.

Among the upgrades to the tracking technology and sensors, repair experts have discovered the screen is taken straight from the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

The teardown - an official name for taking a product apart to reveal its components - was carried out by California-based repair firm iFixit.

Oculus VR was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey.

It is designed to provide users with an immersive virtual reality experience not only for conventional video games, but for other activities as well.

Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when their $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved. 

It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg

The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year.

It also discovered that the display still features the Samsung logo. 

The device's 5.7-inch screen is a super AMOLED touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels. 

This gives it a pixel-per-inch density of 368, and is full HD. 

By comparison, Apple’s iPhone 5S has 326 PPI, and the HTC One M8 has 441.

The teardown also revealed a new positional tracking unit, which is a custom-made external infrared camera, designed specifically for the DK2.

It still has 360° orientation tracking, but as iFixit explained, to get the added benefit of positional tracking, you'll need to be in the external IR camera's field of view.’

Positional tracking is important in virtual reality because it tracks the position of the wearer’s head in 3D, relative to the sensor.

‘When you lean in to examine a virtual object, the environment zooms in to translate your movement, adding another layer of interactivity and realism,’ continued iFixit.

There are 40 LED lights on the outer casing and iFixit claims these are only visible to infrared cameras.

Elsewhere, it features an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer with an update rate of 1000 Hz.

The Oculus Rift developer kits are available from the Oculus VR website for $350 (£207).

For example, a bizarre pillow shaped like a pair of girls legs coupled with an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset is now offering hope to men who do not want to spend the evenings alone sitting on the sofa.

Anybody wearing the headset and sitting alongside the girls lap can rest their head in her lap, talk to her or just sit there - even if the rest of her is missing. The user has the feeling that they are sat next to a virtual girlfriend, in the absence of the real thing (in-game footage shown)

The idea to create the virtual girlfriend for lonely men was developed by the Japanese development firm Up Frontier that offers the chance to sit next to a blonde virtual girlfriend. 

The virtual partner is based on the Unity-chan cartoon character, which is the mascot for an open-source cross-platform game engine called Unity designed by Unity Technologies Japan.

Together with a ‘lap pillow’, which mimics the shape of the character’s legs, users can rest their head on ‘her’ legs both in the virtual world and real-life - sort of

The lap pillow is known as the Hizamakura and is designed to look and feel like a kneeling pair of female legs.
