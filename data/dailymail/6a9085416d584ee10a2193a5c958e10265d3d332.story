Sandeep Singh-Dosanjh has been ordered to repay £13million to the public purse or face another ten years in jail for a VAT fraud scam

The leader of a gang of organised criminals that cheated the taxpayer out of £38million has been ordered to repay £13million or face a further ten years in prison.

Sandeep Singh Dosanjh, 31, from London, was jailed for 15 years in 2012 for the massive VAT fraud scam.

HM Revenue and Customs has ordered him to pay back £3million in hidden assets within three months and the remainder of the £12,887,685.47 within six months.

He masterminded the scam with two friends Ranjot Singh Chahal and Navdeep Singh Gill.

The gang made millions in just 69 days running a series of bogus companies trading fraudulently in EU emissions allowances - known as carbon credits.

In the only case of its kind, Dosanjh and the rest of the gang stole the money through a complex 'missing trader' fraud over six months from January 2009.

The law was changed to prevent carbon credit VAT fraud as a direct result of this investigation.

Singh Dosanjh splashed the proceeds on luxury cars including a Rolls Royce, a Mercedes and a Range Rover and also bought a £1million home in Bayswater, west London.

HMRC said he also attempted to hide further money in offshore bank accounts but they was able to identify them and that money is part of the confiscation order.

Robert Alder, HMRC Criminal Investigations, said: 'Dosanjh enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, investing the proceeds of his crimes in property and luxury cars.

'This was a complex and lengthy financial investigation requiring enquires to be made with overseas authorities.

'This large confiscation order shows that HMRC is committed to not just bring criminals to justice, but also to ensure that we recover the money stolen from the taxpayer by criminals and return it to the Exchequer.'

The fraud was committed by bogus companies importing the carbon credits free of VAT into the UK.

They
then sold the credits on, charging VAT which was never paid to HMRC, 
and then dissolved the importing companies. The credits were then sold 
on again between three further 'buffer' companies – also run by the gang
– before finally being sold on to legitimate companies so the trading 
chain appeared legal.

The VAT charged by the 'missing trader' was then shared out between the gang.

Ranjot Singh Chahal, right, was jailed for nine years and Navdeep Singh Gill, left, was sentenced to 11 years

The trades were made in a matter of minutes via a computer system, and the stolen VAT was transferred to offshore bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates to ‘clean’ the stolen cash.

Confiscation proceedings are ongoing to recover further money from the other convicted defendants.

Gill, of Slough, Berkshire, was sentenced to 11 years and Chahal, of Southall, Middlesex, was sentenced to nine years in prison.

All three were convicted of conspiring to cheat the public revenue between September 2008 and July 2009 after a 14 week trial.
