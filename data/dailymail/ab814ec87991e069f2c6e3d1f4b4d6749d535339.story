Kevin Pietersen's early exit from international cricket is unbelievable, according to his former England teammate Eoin Morgan.

Pietersen's book release earlier this month effectively ended his chances of playing for England again, after the 34-year-old attacked former teammates and coach Andy Flower, but Morgan revealed that he could still be playing.

'I think it's unbelievable in a way, because certainly he could still be playing for England quite easily,' Morgan told Australian Associated Press. 'It is sad to think that probably the best cricketer I have ever played with is not playing [internationally] any more.'

Despite his absence on the international stage, the 34-year-old will join Morgan in Australia for the upcoming Big Bash, where he will feature for Melbourne Stars at the end of the year. 

Morgan, who himself will be playing for Sydney Thunder in an attempt to acclimatise for the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, believes that we will see a different side to Pietersen when he takes to the field for the first time on December 18.

'A guy I have had huge respect for, for a very long time and learnt a huge amount from isn't playing probably as much as he should be. But it is tournaments like the Big Bash that will benefit from that and I think everybody will see a different side to Kevin than they normally would.

'Because everybody sees him in an Ashes series trying to fight against Australia whereas he will be on somebody's side now. I think you will see a very relaxed side to Kevin.'
