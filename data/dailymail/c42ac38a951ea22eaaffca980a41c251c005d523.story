A Spanish football supporter has died hours after sustaining fatal injuries following street clashes between rival fans of Atletico Madrid and Deportivo La Coruna prior to the’ La Liga fixture in the Spanish capital on Sunday.

The man has been named as 43-year-old Deportivo supporter Francisco Javier Romero Taboada, who passed away at Madrid’s Hospital Clínico San Carlos on Sunday afternoon. 

He was pulled out of the Manzanares river near Atletico’s Vicente Calderon stadium earlier on having suffered cardiac arrest, hypothermia and head injuries.

The National Professional Football League (LFP), who were aware of the severity of the supporter’s condition before the start of the match, had tried to get the fixture called off but they were unable to do so as they could not contact The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF). 

A match referee is only permitted to call off a fixture under the orders of RFEF.

LFP sources also revealed that senior figures at the league organisation had attempted to get the match suspended during the first half, after it had started.

The supporter was in a critical condition when the match started at midday Spanish time and his condition deteriorated rapidly. He is believed to have passed away between 2pm and 3pm.

The brawls, which reportedly involved the Frente Atletico and the Riazor Blues ultras groups and took place near the stadium and the Manzanares river, started at around 8.40am, three hours and 20 minutes before kick-off. Atletico Madrid won the match 2-0.

In addition to the deceased, 10 others, including a policeman, suffered injuries. Twenty-five people have been arrested, while a further 30 have been identified, with reports suggesting up to 180 people were involved in the disturbances.

Presidents of both La Liga teams condemned the violence and distanced themselves from the incident.

Atletico president Enrique Cerezo, speaking before the supporter’s death was announced, said: 'I want to say that this has nothing to do with football. These are radical groups who meet up and these are the consequences.

'I repeat that neither Atletico nor Deportivo have anything to do with these incidents, they are organised by radical groups who have their histories and their accounts to settle.'

Meanwhile Deportivo president Tino Fernández said: 'It’s tragic news. I want to express our vehement opposition to violence.'

Sunday's incident was not the first death involving a football supporter near the Vicente Calderon stadium. 

In December 1998, a Real Sociedad supporter Aitor Zabaleta died after he was stabbed by a rival fan, who was later sentenced to 17 years in prison.
