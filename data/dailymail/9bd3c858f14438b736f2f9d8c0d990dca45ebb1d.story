James Packer's Crown casinos have copped a hiding from cashed up VIP gamblers - taking the Melbourne and Perth venues for more than $100 million in less than four months.

The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Mr Packer has told his fellow shareholders at the annual general meeting that the high-rollers are flying on the tables at the moment.

He told them 'the punters are killing us'.

'Our VIP businesses are almost $100million below the theoretical result less than four months into the financial year due to an adverse win rate or put simply, bad luck,' Mr Packer said. 

He told shareholders of the Melbourne and Perth venues, that the results had been mixed.

And as for the house always winning, Mr Packer told the meeting that the casino win rate of late had been 'poor'. The Sydney Morning Herald also reported that group chief executive Rowen Craigie told the AGM that local trading had been 'impacted by general softness in consumer sentiment' and that the roll of the dice had even affected Macau, which had suffered a slump.

Mr Packer is Australia's third richest person with a reported wealth of $6.6billion. He has more than 50 per cent shareholding of Crown.

His recent application for a new Crown Casino, slated for the redeveloped Barangaroo area of Sydney, was cleared in just three months by New South Wales authorities, which the body responsible for approval believed to be the fastest time in history.

The billionaire is also reportedly close to signing a major, multi-million deal to buy-out Peter Holmes a Court's share of the South Sydney Rabbitohs and  join Russell Crowe as co-owner of the club.

Negotiations between the parties are being finalised more than a year after they began, but have been kept silent in the hope that they would not disrupt the NRL club's tilt at a drought-breaking premiership.
