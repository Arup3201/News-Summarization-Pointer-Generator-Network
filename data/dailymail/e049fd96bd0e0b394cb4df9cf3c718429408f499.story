Four children who were rescued from a Texas 'swingers club' have been removed from their new foster parents after saying they were being abused there as well.

A 13-year-old girl, a 14-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy who are siblings, plus a 17-year-old boy have been placed in the temporary custody of child protective services by a Wood County, Texas judge.

The siblings had been living with John and Margaret Cantrell since 2005 and the 17-year-old boy had been adopted by the couple.

A Wood County Judge has ordered that four children be placed in the temporary custody of Child Protective Services following allegations of abuse

Fox News reported that Mrs Cantrell was the person who first alerted authorities to the plight of the children at a Mineola 'swingers club' in 2004.

Patrick Kelly received a life sentence for his role in the Mineola 'swingers club' in 2004

The three siblings had been among the victims of a 'kindergarten' at the club, where children were drugged and learned to dance provocatively. Seven people were convicted in the case.

The Cantrells have now lost custody of the children after a physical altercation between the 16-year-old girl and Mrs Cantrell.

Shari Pulliam, of the state's Child Protective Services, told Fox News: 'We were called by the Cantrells to pick up that 16-year-old.

'They were refusing to parent that child any longer'.

After the incident the agency interviewed all of the children living at the address.

According to court documents the 16-year-old girl said that she had been slapped across the face and 'popped in the mouth' by Mrs Cantrell.

Another child was allegedly beaten with a wooden backscratcher until it broke.

In 2008 Mr Cantrell faced charges of a lewd act with a child, but the prosecution was later dropped.
