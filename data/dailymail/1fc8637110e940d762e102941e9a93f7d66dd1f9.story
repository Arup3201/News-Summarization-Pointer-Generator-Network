New man in charge: Rob Edwards has been appointed as manager at Tranmere Rovers

Tranmere Rovers have appointed Rob Edwards as their new manager after the former Wales defender turned down a job in the Premier League.

Edwards, 41, is the permanent successor to Ronnie Moore, who was suspended by Rovers in February after being charged by the FA for breaching betting rules and then sacked last month after pleading guilty.

When Moore was suspended Tranmere were four points above the drop zone, but under the caretaker care of the 61-year-old's assistant John McMahon they won only four of their final 15 games and were relegated to League Two for the first time since 1988/89.

Edwards is
 the man tasked with trying to lead Rovers back out of the bottom 
division, with Tranmere announcing that the former Wales international 
had rejected a position with a top-flight club to take the job.

A Tranmere statement read: 'Tranmere Rovers have appointed former Welsh international Rob Edwards as their new manager.

'Edwards, 41, recently left Exeter City and has turned down a job at a Premier League club to take charge at Prenton Park.

'The
 former Preston defender was assistant manager at Exeter City where he 
played a key role as the club won successive promotions from the 
Conference to League One.'
