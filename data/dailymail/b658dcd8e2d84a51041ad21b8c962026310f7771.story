They say no publicity is bad publicity.

But when images of a £180-an-hour escort posing beside a four-poster bed in one of their plushest suites were posted online, bosses at an 18th century country house hotel reacted with horror to the unwanted plug.

Posing in little more than her underwear and a string of pearls, the sex worker - who calls herself Helen Jones - touts for work showing herself lounging seductively in the £190-a-night wood-panelled Mahogany Suite of the Soughton Hall Hotel.

No doubt the historic surroundings are intended to appeal to prospective clients of the 40-year-old, who claims to be a qualified accountant.

Certainly one satisfied customer was delighted with the service she offered, posting online: ‘If there were qualifications for escorts, Helen would definitely be PhD material. The arrangements were perfect.’ 

However managers at the family-owned hotel near Northop, Flintshire - close to the home of footballer Michael Owen - were less than impressed when shown the results of the unauthorised photoshoot. They are now trying to get the pictures removed from the website.

Room service: Jones promises punters a 'discreet' service, but her promotional pictures have already attracted attention from the hotel's owners

‘We were totally blown away - we are really shocked,’ general manager Annette Gallop said yesterday.

‘We’re going to try our best to get this removed from her website. We have never come across this before now.’ When asked for her part why she chose Soughton Hall for her photoshoot, Ms Jones said: ‘No reason other than (it’s) a nice hotel.’

On her site she describes herself as an ‘independent companion’ available for dates with ‘executive white and blue collar workers’.

She proclaims: ‘I have an excellent reputation as a genuine, high class, personable and friendly personal dating service.’

The site is liberally illustrated with glamour modelling-style pictures in which Ms Jones demurely turns her face away from the camera.

She describes herself as ‘almost 6ft bare-footed’ and with a figure ‘in perfect proportion to my height’, adding that she has been ‘blessed with a body that is naturally fit and lithe’.

While ‘quite shy’, she says she has ‘impeccable manners’ and enjoys ‘good food and wines’, the theatre and horse-racing.

She will only see clients aged over 35, giving them the option of coming to her apartment, going to their home, or visiting their hotel suite.

Explaining the arrangements for meeting at a date’s hotel, she assures them she knows ‘discretion is paramount’, adding: ‘A tall, immaculately groomed, slim, well-dressed lady might turn heads - for all the right reasons - whereas a less discreet escort visiting you is sure to attract the wrong sort of attention!’

Plush: The suite will normally cost punters £190 per night

For a home visit, she will arrive in a business suit, she adds, rather than ‘tottering up your garden path - make-up by Ronald McDonald, and swinging a handbag!’ Clients have to pay £180-an-hour for her services.

Overnight meetings of 12 hours cost £850, while a 24-hour ‘date’ with Ms Jones costs £1,500.

She stresses they are paying for her ‘time and companionship’ and that ‘any consensual sexual activity that occurs is a private matter between individuals’.

In comments on her site, one satisfied client describes how: ‘I opened the door to be greeted by this Amazonian-type woman.

‘The pictures on her site are genuine but in no way prepare you for seeing her in the flesh, so to speak. ‘She is blond, almost 6ft tall, so you can imagine the legs, but in splendid proportion, with a great figure and is also really pretty.’

Another wrote: ‘Very tall! Attractive and with a body stolen from an athlete 15 years younger.

Annette Gallop, general manager of Soughton Hall, said: ¿We were totally blown away - we are really shocked,¿

‘Helen’s only priority was that I enjoyed our time together and in that she succeeded brilliantly.’

While a third commented: ‘Woody Allen once said that the brain was his second favourite organ. To spend an evening where both were fully engaged was a delight.’

According to Soughton Hall Hotel’s website, the Mahogany Suite is ‘elegant... with large mahogany four poster bed with views over rear gardens and parkland beyond’.

The hotel dates back to 1714 and was originally built as a Bishop’s Palace, with former guests said to have included a chaplain to Queen Victoria.
