If you have six different jobs, one office romance and are late 154 times, you’re the typical British worker.

Mr or Miss Average also takes 125 days off sick and goes through ten job interviews before retirement.

We also drink 32,396 cups of tea or coffee at our desks and get eight sizable pay rises.

Stress: 2,000 British workers were polled in the study which found that the average employee will take 125 days off sick from work and have 875 arguments with other colleagues

Surprisingly, a survey of 2,000 
employees also found we only grumble about the boss 623 times over four 
decades – or around 14 times a year.

Although we have one office romance,  we apparently have just three major bust-ups with our colleagues.

The unpredictable economic climate also means the average worker will endure at least one period of unemployment or redundancy.

He or she is likely to have at least one period during their working life where doctors will sign them off with stress.

Number of different jobs - 6

Number of companies worked at - 6

Major bust ups / arguments - 3

Small disagreements / grumbles - 875

Office romances - 1

Cups of tea / coffee - 45,500

Sick days - 125

Late for work - 188

Periods of unemployment - 1

Job interviews  - 10

Periods of serious financial worries - 2

Redundancy - 1

Periods of stress - 3

Relationship strain due to long hours - 2

Signed off work with stress - 1

Financial stability is a big concern 
for many adults, despite an average starting wage of £10,983.50, people 
still struggle to cope with the rising cost of living.

Most will work their way through two long periods of financial worry before seeing light at the end of the tunnel.

For 34 per cent of the population, this means finding a second job to make ends meet.

Four in ten admit the demands of their
job have had a negative impact on family life and relationships – with 
the average worker going through a rough patch with their partner at 
least twice.

One third of those polled admitted 
they sometimes lose the balance between their work and personal life, 
letting long hours take over.

And for 29 per cent, the stress of work and the impact it has had on their personal life has led to them seeking medical help.

The survey was commissioned by 
healthcare provider Benenden Health. Spokesman Paul Keenan said: ‘We 
hear how UK workers are working longer and harder than ever before but 
this health check of the average adult’s working life confirms what we 
feared.

Within an average career span, you’re 
likely to find reasons to grumble 14 times a year yet will only change 
jobs once a decade – perhaps because the grass isn’t necessarily greener
on the other side.

‘Heavy workloads and disagreements 
with colleagues can all take a heavy toll on our well-being and many of 
us are seeing this spill over into our home lives.

‘This is coupled with the ongoing threat of redundancy whilst the UK economy struggles to get back on track.’

Engineering workers will have the most
pay rises over the course of their career, getting ten boosts to their 
salary over their working lifetime.

Those in hospitality have the least 
amount of pay rises getting just five. The culture and sport sector were
also found to be the most likely to have an office romance as well as 
take more sick days than any other industry.

Mr Keenan added: ‘There are small 
positives – for example, those losing control of a work-life  balance is
still in the minority.

‘But with over a third of people needing to find second jobs, maintaining this balance will become a losing battle.’
