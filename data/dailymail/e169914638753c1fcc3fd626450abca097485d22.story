Jacob Meyer called police after noticing this Jeep driving erratically down the I-70 in Kansas on Tueday

The Jeep can be seen veering on to the hard shoulder before hitting a trailer attached to a broken-down pickup truck at the side of the road

He captured the moment Harris ran off the carriageway, on to the shoulder, then launched off an empty trailer being towed by a 2006 Ford F350, flipping over the top of the vehicle.

According to police, Harris was the only one hurt in the accident, and his injuries are not thought to be life threatening.

Officers say the Ford had just been red-tagged, meaning it was broken down at the side of the road at the time of the smash.

Mr Meyer said: 'Today I was the main witness to this wreck I recorded. No one was in the truck that got hit and the guy in the jeep got out of the car on his own will.So happy know everyone is okay.'
