Mario Balotelli was in his usual playful mood as Italy continued their preparations for the World Cup at a training camp in Coverciano.

The former Manchester City striker was seen giving Andrea Pirlo a tap on the head as he ate a peach in a doorway.

Balotelli, had been subjected to racist chants during a training session at the national team's complex last week although he did not react.

The 23-year-old later condemned the 
actions of those fans in an interview with GQ Magazine, saying: 'They 
aren’t used to seeing people who are different, not white, who act not 
as rebels but normally.'

'I think what the ignorant people don’t like is that people who are different are allowed to act that way.

'These stupid people, they get angry with me, they say horrible things, but I haven’t done anything different from other people.

'I have made mistakes, like everyone does, and I have always paid for my mistakes.

'I think that if I was white maybe some people would still find me irritating or annoying but it wouldn’t be the same. Absolutely not.

'Jealousy is a horrible thing, but when this jealousy is towards people who are different from the majority, and who maybe also have more than you, then it becomes anger, it becomes rage, and that’s the overt racism.'

Italy coach Cesare Prandelli put the team through their paces on the training days after extending his contract to manage the Azzurri.

Prandelli, who secured a runners-up spot at Euro 2012 and third place at the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil will remain in charge until after the 2016 European Championships.
