As star names from across the globe gear up for the glitzy World Cup in Brazil next month, spare a thought for the top names who have been left behind.

There are only 23 men who can make up each country's squad which has left international managers with plenty to ponder and some tough decisions to make.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the best World Cup Snubbed XI...

Maarten Stekelenburg (Holland)

The Dutch goalkeeper fell out of favour at Fulham towards the end of their relegation campaign this season and it has cost him a place in Louis Van Gaal's side.

Stekelenburg was first choice in between the sticks for Holland when Edwin Van Der Sar retired in 2010 and played in the last World Cup and Euro 2012.

Despite winning 54 caps he was not even one of the four goalkeeper's included in the preliminary 30-man squad.

Difficult time of it: Maarten Stekelenburg didn't pull up any trees during his first season at relegated Fulham

Alvaro Arbeloa (Spain)

The Real Madrid right-back has paid for an inconsistent season with the Spanish giants.

He has won 56 caps for Spain and was part of the side to win the last three major international tournaments - Euro 2008 and 2012, plus the last World Cup in South Africa.

But the former Liverpool defender made only 22 appearances for Real and has not played for Spain since a friendly versus Belarus in October last year.

Domenico Criscito (Italy)

The Zenit defender was left shocked by his omission, not even making it into Italy's provisional 30-man squad.

He played in Italy's most recent friendly against Spain and was involved in matches against Nigerian and Germany last November.

Criscito assumed he was a shoo-in for the team.

Joleon Lescott (England)

The centre-back is set to leave Manchester City after struggling for a regular starting place, which has meant he was overlooked for Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad.

At 31 years old he will know time is ticking for him to regain some form to be considered for the national team again.

Ashley Cole (England)

Cole was the most high-profile omission from the England team and the toughest decision that Hodgson had to make.

Everton defender Leighton Baines is set to start for England at the World Cup and Hodgson opted for Southampton's teenage sensation Luke Shaw to get big tournament experience.

You've not played enough! Ashley Cole has struggled for games under new Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho

Samir Nasri (France)

France manager Didier Deschamps has divided opinion by leaving out Premier League winner Nasri.

Deschamps decided he was a disruptive influence and wouldn't be happy on the bench, but Nasri has notched up 50 appearances for club and country this campaign and won two cups.

Unbelievable! Didier Deschamps has caused uproar by not picking Samir Nasri in the France squad

Kaka (Brazil)

Once the world's most expensive player when he joined Real Madrid from AC Milan for £55million, albeit only for a few days.

Injuries have blighted his career and he has failed to reproduce the kind of form which commanded that fee, since then returning to the Italian club on a free transfer.

Philippe Coutinho (Brazil)

The tricky Brazilian has been outstanding for Liverpool and was one of the key players in their title charge this season.

His stunning winner against Manchester City, curled into the bottom right corner, had many believing this was to be Liverpool's season.

But stiff competition, particularly for attacking midfield players, meant he just missed out when Luiz Felipe Scolari named his squad.

Ronaldinho (Brazil)

Ronaldinho, arguably one of the most gifted players to take to the field, was left out after it was considered he was partying too much and not focusing enough on the game so close to the World Cup.

Scolari's assistant Carlos Alberto Parreira said he 'lacked dedication and consistency' to his international career.

Aged 34, he has 33 goals in 97 appearances for Brazil, won a World Cup in 2002, and has a glittering trophy cabinet, but this was a step too far.

Big surprise! Philippe Coutinho has been overlooked by the host nation Brazil despite impressing at Liverpool

Out: Ronaldinho

Going nowhere: Kaka

Snub: Robinho

Carlos Tevez (Argentina)

Never far from controversy, the Juventus striker, who scored 18 goals In his debut season for the title-winning side, told the Argentinian FA last month not to recall him to the national team because he had booked tickets to go to Disney Land with his family.

They duly obliged, and ex-Wigan striker Franco Di Santo was picked instead, meaning one of the best forwards in the world, in scintillating form, will not be at the tournament.

Dani Osvaldo (Italy)

A chequered history of fights and fall-outs with team-mates and managers did not stop Osvaldo earning a big money move to Southampton last summer.

And he was a regular as Italy's number 9 since making his debut in 2011.

In-different form for the south coast club, then another attack on a team-mate meant he moved to Serie A champions Juventus, but his return of three goals in 18 games has not impressed Italy manager Cesare Prandelli.

Too much trouble? Carlos Tevez hasn't been picked by Argentina because of his effect on the dressing room

One major flop: Dani Osvaldo failed to live up to his billing at Southampton before a loan move to Juventus

Substitutes' bench

John Ruddy (England)

The Norwich goalkeeper was left devastated after not only being relegated this season, despite being one of his club's best performers, but then being left out of Hodgson's plans.He would only have been back-up to Joe Hart, but it was a harsh omission on a player who has been involved in every squad that he has been available for in the past two years.

Gael Clichy (France)

The Manchester City left-back was picked for France's previous World Cup and European Championship squads but days after helping his club win the title was told he was not going to Brazil.Paris Saint-Germain's Lucas Digne and Patrice Evra made the cut instead.

Looking ahead: Gael Clichy won't be involved for France as they look to win back the biggest prize on Earth

Not too slick: Argentina have preferred Franco Di Santo to PSG's mercurial Javier Pastore

Rio Ferdinand (England)

The centre-back pulled out of England's final World Cup qualifiers after a meeting with Roy Hodgson to discuss his long-term injury problems and has not been considered since then.

Erik Lamela (Argentina)

A disappointing season at Tottenham meant the winger has not been included in Argentina's star-studded squad.

He was one of the most highly-rated players in football when he joined Spurs from Roma for £25.7million but, often playing with a muscle problem, he has struggled to live up to that.

Javier Pastore (Argentina)

The forward has failed to live up to his billing as one of the hottest young players in his teenage years.

He was in Argentina's last World Cup squad, aged just 20, but just two goals for Paris Saint-Germain this season has cost him his place in the national team.

Standing by! West Ham striker Andy Carroll will only be called upon by England if they suffer injuries up front
