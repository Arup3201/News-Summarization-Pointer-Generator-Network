Pressure to secure a better deal for pensioners facing crippling care home costs intensified yesterday.

Former minister Stephen Dorrell said a plan to offer loans to pay for care was not delivering ‘the objective the Government set out’.

Mr Dorrell, chairman of the Commons health select committee, particularly questioned a proposal to limit loans to people with assets of less than £23,000.

In July, the Coalition promised that the loans scheme would prevent anyone from having to meet the cost of care while they were alive.

In a second attack on the scheme yesterday, Lord Lipsey suggested that pensioners taking up the loans could be forced to repay thousands of pounds if they inadvertently failed to disclose all their assets.

He urged ministers to change a ‘nasty’ part of the new legislation that could penalise elderly people who make an honest mistake in applying for the loans from their council.

‘As the Bill is now drafted, if you make a mistake the local authority can pursue you for all the money and even sell your house if you make a mistake,’ he said. ‘Fraud should be pursued, but not an old lady who has just made a mistake. It is a very nasty clause.’

Lord Lipsey’s attack came as Downing 
Street signalled a change of heart over plans to deny middle-class 
pensioners access to the deferred-payment scheme, under which 
Government-backed loans would cover home help hire and care home fees, 
and would be repaid from the person’s estate.

Lord Warner, a member of the independent Dilnot Commission that drew up plans to cap care costs, said of the Government: ‘I think they’ve been a bit sneaky.’

Lord Lipsey has praised the Daily Mail for its ‘sustained and splendid’ campaign against crippling care home costs that force people to sell their homes.

The peer said the paper had made a real difference by bringing the scandal to the public’s attention.

On Monday night, he exposed the Government’s plans to restrict access to a deferred-payment scheme to those with assets of less than around £23,000.

During his speech in the House of Lords, he also mentioned his admiration for the Daily Mail, which has long highlighted the effects of sky-high care fees. Three years ago, we revealed at least 20,000 people a year have to sell up to pay their care costs, denying their children an inheritance.

Yesterday, he told the Mail: ‘I praise the Daily Mail for its campaign on people having to sell their houses to pay for care.

‘We owe the Government’s original proposals to impose a cap on care costs very much to the Mail’s sustained and splendid campaign. I’m sure the Mail will continue to campaign until the Government changes its position.’

David Lipsey, a former political editor of the Economist and Labour policy adviser, was created a life peer in 1999.

However, Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘£23,000 is the starting point because that is the means-test threshold. For those who have assets that are separate from their home, what is the level above which they should make some contribution? We are consulting on that.’

Care Minister Norman Lamb said: ‘No decisions have been taken. We’re listening carefully to all consultation responses and take seriously the concerns raised.’

However, he also suggested that anyone excluded had a ‘vast amount of money in the bank’.

Last night, Lord Lipsey, the Labour peer and former member of the 1990s Royal Commission on elderly care, welcomed the apparent shift by the Government. He said: ‘It would be good if they raised the threshold substantially, but it would be best if they dropped it all together.’

The charity Age UK shared his concern about councils being given the power to sell an applicant’s house if a mistake was made in declaring assets, saying that it could deter pensioners from applying.

However, a Tory health spokesman said local authorities already had such powers but only used them as a last resort.

Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser on older people’s care, said: ‘People with £23,000 in the bank, that they have saved up all their lives, do not have “significant means”. Everything in the Dilnot proposals is being watered down and I kind of wonder what these reforms are going to achieve.’

A Downing Street source said: ‘The idea that anyone will have to sell their homes to pay for social care is simply scaremongering.

‘The Government is spending £1billion a year in order to ensure people can keep their homes, deal with the crisis left by the Labour Party, and help provide dignity for all in old age.’
