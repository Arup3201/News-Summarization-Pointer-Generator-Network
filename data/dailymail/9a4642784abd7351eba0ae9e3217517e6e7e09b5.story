- Earlier that year he was named man of the match in the FA Cup final, as City won their first piece of silverware in 35 years after beating Stoke 1-0.

- On the final day of the 2011/2012 Premier League season, Balotelli set up Sergio Aguero’s last-gasp winner in Manchester City’s 3-2 victory over QPR to help secure their first title for 44 years.

Mario Balotelli 

Lows

- Balotelli, then with Inter, appeared on an Italian comedy show Strisscia la Noticia in March 2010 and was presented with an AC Milan shirt, adorned with his name and number. He was later caught by a secret camera wearing the jersey, much to the displeasure of his employer and their fans.

- The striker scored his first goal for Manchester City in a 2-0 win over West Brom in November 2010, but the achievement was marred after the striker received a red card for a rash challenge on Youssouf Mulumbu.

- In December 2010, then Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini told Balotelli that he would have to ‘change his attitude’ following the striker’s claims that he had never heard of Jack Wilshere, after beating the Arsenal midfielder to Europe’s Golden Boy Award.

- In March 2011, it emerged that Balotelli had thrown a dart at a City youth player at the club’s Carrington academy.

- When clean through against Los Angeles Galaxy in pre-season in 2011, Balotelli performed a needless pirouette and back heel and missed a virtually open goal. He was immediately substituted despite the fact it was just a friendly.

- In probably his most famous off-field incident, Balotelli set off a firework in his bathroom, causing a fire.

- In December 2011, Balotelli ignored curfew ahead of Manchester City’s game against Chelsea to visit a curry house.

- A few days later, he was involved in a training round scuffle with City team-mate Micah Richards.

- In January 2012, Balotelli was charged with violent conduct by the FA and subsequently handed a four-match ban, after being punished retrospectively for a head stamp on Tottenham’s Scott Parker.

Luis Suarez 

Highs

- Suarez described his £22.8million transfer from Ajax to Liverpool in January 2011 as a ‘dream move’ and scored on his debut in a 2-0 win over Stoke.

- In February 2012, Suarez lifted his first and only trophy on Merseyside, the League Cup, after beating Cardiff City on penalties.

- In April 2012, Suarez scored his first hat trick for Liverpool against Norwich, including a spectacular 45-yard effort that caught John Ruddy off his line.

- Last season Suarez scored 31 goals in just 33 Premier League matches, which saw him win the Golden Boot and be named PFA and FWA Player of the Year.

Luis Suarez 

Lows

- During the 2010 World Cup quarter-final between Uruguay and Ghana, Suarez prevented Dominic Adiyah from scoring a last minute goal with a deliberate handball on the goal line and was subsequently sent off. When Asomah Gyan missed the ensuing penalty, Suarez was filmed celebrating in the tunnel.

- In November 2010, while at Ajax, Suarez was banned for seven matches after being found guilty of biting PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal.

- Suarez was alleged to have made racist comments towards Manchester United defender Patrice Evra in October 2011. He was found guilty by a three-man panel and served an eight-game suspension, while paying a £40,000 fine.

- In December 2011, Suarez was handed a one-match ban for making an offensive gesture towards Fulham fans.

- Ahead of Liverpool’s clash with Manchester United in February 2012, Suarez caused controversy by refusing to shake Evra’s hand. He was branded a disgrace by Sir Alex Ferguson.

- In October 2012, having been accused of diving by then Everton manager David Moyes, Suarez performed a theatrical celebration in front of him after scoring a goal at Goodison Park.

- The striker’s biggest ban to date is the 10-match suspension for violent conduct after biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic in April 2013.

- The Uruguay striker bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder at this summer’s World Cup, before falling to the ground and clutching his own face. Retrospective action saw Suarez banned for nine international matches, as well as any football-related activity for four months and being fined £65,000. The suspension has since been modified and Suarez is allowed to train and play friendlies.
