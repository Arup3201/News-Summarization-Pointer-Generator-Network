A Florida teenager has earned her college degree at the age of 16... a week before she graduates from high school.

Grace Bush received her bachelor's degree in criminal justice from the Florida Atlantic University on Friday.

But she is now looking forward to a double celebration as she prepares to graduate from high school this week.

The teenager told CBS Miami: 'It's kind of weird that I graduated college before high school.'

Grace, who says she would like to become chief justice of the United States, managed to complete the four-year degree in just three years with a 3.8 grade point average.

She took advantage of her school's dual enrolment programme, which allows students to earn credit for degree courses while studying at school.

Grace plays the flute in two orchestras during her free time and hopes to study for a master's degree after the summer before continuing on at law school.

In May last year, MailOnline reported how a Georgia teenager who was homeless for most of her time at school credited hard work for being made valedictoria of her graduating class.

Chelsea Fearce, from Clayton County, said: 'I just told myself to keep working, because the future will not be like this anymore.'

Miss Fearce, who was 17 at the time, did so well at Charles Drew High School that she will start college as a junior in the fall.

'Worry about being a little hungry sometimes, go hungry sometimes. You just have to deal with it. You eat what you can, when you can,' the teenager, who achieved a 4.466 GPA, told WSBTV.

And in June 2012, it was reported that David Boone had gone from sleeping on a park bench to one of Harvard's dorm rooms after he was accepted to the university.

At the time David was a 17-year-old senior at MC2 Stem, a high school in Cleveland, Ohio, that focuses largely on engineering and science classes, who, with the help of a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was offered a full-ride scholarship to Harvard.

At the time Jeff McClellan, the principal of MC2 Stem, told the ABC News affiliate: 'Here's a kid who's doing everything in his power to get where he wants to go and we had the available resources to provide a little additional support.'
