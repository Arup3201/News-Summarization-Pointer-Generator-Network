Chlorine gas was 'systematically and repeatedly' used against Syrian civilians in attacks on their villages this year, according to a new report.

New findings by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) conclude that the dangerous, choking gas was contained in bombs dropped on the settlements.

The report does not pin blame for the attacks on anybody, though the Syrian Army, loyal to president Bashar Assad, have previously been blamed for horrifying chemical weapons attacks.

Aftermath: Chlorine gas causes choking, lung damage and even death. Pictured above are two mourners standing over the bodies of alleged victims of a chemical weapons attack 

International reaction: The Syrian regime earlier surrendered a huge cache of chemical weapons to be destroyed (pictured above are UN inspectors in the city of Ghouta)

Earlier this year they admitted possessing an arsenal of chemical weapons - but all the stockpiles they declared to international agencies have now been removed. 

The global weapons watchdog interviewed victims, physicians, eye-witnesses and others and concluded that the signs pointed almost certainly to chlorine.

The substance is a toxic industrial gas that is not specifically classified as a chemical weapon. The chemical irritates the throat can cause victim's lungs to fill with water, drowning them.

The gas can also attack the skin and eyes, causing burning, swelling, itching and irritation. 

An earlier report by the same OPCW mission also said chlorine likely was used as a weapon in Syria.

A separate organisation, Human Rights Watch, said in May that it had strong evidence that this year Syrian army helicopters dropped bombs containing chlorine on the same rebel-held villages mentioned by the OPCW report. 

The attacks earlier this year came as Damascus and the OPCW were involved in a complex mission to remove Syria's stockpile of chemical weapons and precursor chemicals from the country.

All of the poison gas, nerve agents and other chemicals declared by Syria have now been removed from the country and the most toxic parts of the arsenal destroyed.

The OPCW said the fact finding mission would continue its work as there was 'a spate of new allegations' of chlorine attacks in Syria in August.
