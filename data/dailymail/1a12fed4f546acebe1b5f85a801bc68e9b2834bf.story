A youth crime commissioner has been suspended after admitting having a relationship with a married former Tory councillor more than twice her age.

Kerry Boyd, 20, now faces being sacked after it was revealed that she had become close to father-of-two and ex Kent county councillor, Robert Burgess, 50.

It is just the latest embarrassment for police in Kent:  Miss Boyd was only appointed to the publicly-funded £15,000-a-year role in March, replacing teenager Paris Brown, who was forced out last year after posting a series of offensive tweets.

This morning there were calls for Miss Boyd's boss, the already notorious Kent Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), Ann Barnes, to resign. 

It is the latest fiasco under her watch, and Mrs Barnes herself has been criticised for overspending, behaving 'like a diva', and humiliating herself and the post with a 'toe-curling' appearance in a fly-on-the-wall television documentary.

'Very close': Youth tsar Kerry Boyd, 20, has been suspended over her friendship with Robert Burgess, 50

It was Mrs Barnes who told Miss Boyd, who lives with her parents in the village of Garlinge, outside Margate, to step aside after the younger woman revealed her close friendship with Mr Burgess.

Miss Boyd, whom it was hoped would improve the public image of the post following the Paris Brown fiasco, was interviewed before being appointed, and given a reference by Mr Burgess.

But she did not tell police chiefs about her friendship with Mr Burgess.

As a result, she was told to step down while the police commissioner looked into the scandal.

A spokesman for Mrs Barnes' office said they were supporting Miss Boyd 'at this difficult time' but added: 'We are concerned that Kerry did not feel able to disclose the full extent of her personal circumstances earlier...

'As part of our support for Kerry, she is not undertaking any public engagements for the time being.'

As Youth Commissioner for Kent, Miss Boyd's job involved building relationships between young people and the police.

Mr Burgess was a Tory councillor in Margate til he lost his seat last May, while Miss Boyd is a former head girl

A former head girl at Hartsdown Academy in Margate, she met Mr Burgess more than two years ago and was pictured with him holding an Olympic torch in 2012.

Mr Burgess, who lost his seat as councillor for Margate West, told The Sun: 'I have been very close with Kerry for a period of time, a good few months...

'If she lost her job because of a friendship with me, that would be a shame.'

An electronics teacher, he lives with wife Eunice, 49, in a £200,000 house in Ramsgate.

Mr Burgess said Miss Boyd was 'quite upset by all the allegations and stuff going on', but said she was refusing to contact him.

Today there were calls for Mrs Barnes to resign.

Writing on Twitter, Tony Stevens said: 'Just go, Mrs Barnes', while Robert Schifreen wrote: 'It really is time for you to go now.

'It's the right thing, and you need to do it for the sake of Kent Police.'

And councillor Tony Martin, of the Kent Police and Crime Panel, which will hear an explanation from Mrs Barnes at a meeting tomorrow, said: 'The general worry I have got is that it's not the first time it has happened with Ann Barnes.

'We were assured last time that this would not happen again.  It's on the back of an unflattering TV documentary last week which is reinforcing the lack of focus and detail in the office.

'That's a worrying trend.'

Mr Martin added: 'I think she should be considering her position and I am sure she will be looking at herself very closely....

'I would expect members to be briefed tomorrow on exactly what has happened.'

But a source close to Mrs Barnes said: 'She is not planning to resign', adding that Mrs Barnes would appear before the Kent Police and Crime Panel tomorrow to explain her humiliating performance in last week's Channel 4 documentary.

This afternoon Mrs Barnes reiterated her 'support' for Miss Boyd and said she would not say anything more before tomorrow's meeting.

Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) were brought in to improve relations between public and the police, and restore public faith in police.

But they have been blighted by controversy from the start, and nowhere more so than in Kent.

Ann Barnes became the highest profile of the country's 41 PCCs a year ago when The Mail On Sunday revealed her £15,000-a-year Youth Commissioner, Paris Brown, had posted a series of racist and homophobic comments online.

Television embarrassment: The Kent Police and Crime Commissioner tries to explain her 'crime onion'

Writing on Twitter shortly before she was appointed, the 17-year-old called homosexuals ‘fags’, immigrants ‘illegals’ and travellers ‘pikeys’, and said she had ‘a thing for older men’, an apparent reference to a teacher at her former school.

Kent PCC Mrs Barnes tried to save the teenager's job, but Brown was forced to quit.

Earlier this year, Mrs Barnes herself was criticised for spending nearly £200,000 on moving her office less than two miles and trying to keep the cost of it hidden at a time when her force was trying to make cuts of £20million a year.

The £85,000-a-year crime tsar also spent £7,500 on consultants for  advice on how to improve her 'brand', and was accused of parking her own £15,000 battle bus, which she called 'Ann Force 1', in disabled spots in a police car park.

Protest: The Kent PCC was accused of humiliating herself and Kent Police after appearing on television

Then last week, Mrs Barnes was accused of embarrassing Kent Police with her toe-curling performance in a fly-on-the-wall documentary called Meet The Police Commissioner.

Despite being advised not to take part, Mrs Barnes did, and was shown struggling to explain what her job was, as well as using incomprehensible management speak.  She was also filmed trying to explain what she called a 'crime onion'.

Viewers took to social media, calling her 'David Brent' and saying she was humiliating herself and the police force, while a plane was flown over Maidstone, where she works, trailing a banner saying: '#annbarnesout -resign'.
