A 27-year-old woman suffering from a rare cancer is desperate to raise £25,000 to fund an operation that could save her life.

Laura Baxter was diagnosed with cancer of the appendix last year, which affects just one in two million people. She had surgery to remove the deadly cancerous tissue in June but was told it had started to regrow in August.

Experts now say she has just six to eight months to live. But determined not to give up hope, Laura, of St Ives, Cambridgeshire, found a top doctor in Belgium who believes he can save her life.

The operation alone will cost £25,000, however, while she will need extra cash to cover flights.Laura and her friends and family have so far collected about £7,000 towards their vital target.

Determined: Laura, with her pet dog, and with boyfriend Wayne Cooper, says she is not ready to give up fighting

Miss Baxter said last night from her 
bed in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge: 'The operation in Belgium is 
with the hope of removing all or controlling the cancer.

'I don't know which it will be yet, but doing nothing... it will kill me.

'Doctors in Belgium are confident they can do a good job to hopefully remove it. I'm guessing that this is my last chance.'

Courageous Laura added: 'It's either that or admit defeat. What would other people do at my age and in my situation?

'I'm not ready to just give up.'

Pseudomyxoma peritonei, or PMP is a cancer of the appendix. It usually starts as a small growth that breaks through the appendix wall and spreads tumour cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity.

It produces a mucus, which contains the cancer cells, that spreads to the abdominal organs such as the intestines, liver and pancreas.

In June, Laura had a nine-hour operation at Basingstoke Hospital - one of two PMP specialist centres in the UK - to remove her affected organs, including parts of her small intestine.

The surgeon left small bits of 
cancerous tissue because of the length of surgery amid hopes of not 
damaging more of her liver and small intestine.

Doctors tried to kill the remaining cancerous cells through heated chemotherapy treatment. But
in August, Miss Baxter was told the cancer had started to grow again in
her bowel and was given six to eight months to live by doctors at 
Addenbrooke's

Giving hope: Prof Dr Wim Ceelen at Gent University Hospital, Belgium, believes he can help Laura

Laura, 
who works for golf ball manufacturer Titleist in St Ives, refused to 
accept the diagnosis and looked for doctors overseas who would be able 
to operate.

'When the 
cancer started growing back where they left it on the bowel and liver, I
was told there was not going to be a second operation,' she said.

'Basingstoke
and the Christie in Manchester - the other PMP specialist hospital - 
don't feel they can operate because of where the cancer is.

'They don't have the expertise.'

After
desperately searching for doctors in Switzerland, Germany and America, 
Laura found Prof Wim Ceelen at Gent University Hospital, Belgium.

Prof Ceelan has carried out more than 450 of the operations that Laura needs.

Her mother Jacky Baxter said: 'We have to raise the money for her. Some days I wake up and think it's a dream and then I realise it's actually happening.

'It's absolutely devastating for it to happen to someone so young.

'There are times when Laura seems to be coping, then the next moment she is very angry and cries.

'She asks - why is it happening to me? What have I done to deserve this?

'She's a nice girl and hasn't done anything, so it's very hard.'

Mrs Baxter added: 'The doctors at Addenbrooke's have said they don't have the knowledge and they say that if they operate, Laura will die on the table.

'But the doctor in Belgium says they have done the operation before and it will be successful.

'The NHS won't pay for the operation because Addenbrooke's says the cancer is terminal, but they have said they will reimburse her part of the money if she survives.

'That money would then be given to the Pseudomyxoma Survivors charity to put the money into research to stop this from happening to anyone else.'

Laura would have her operation within two weeks before spending a month in hospital in Gent recovering if she can raise the money.
