James Coney, Money Mail editor and Southampton supporter, assesses the rise-and-rise of the South Coast club, third in the Premier League table, after seven games. 

I admit it, if I look back to the state Southampton were in over the summer, I was desperate.

Mauricio Pochettino had quit, Rickie Lambert was gone already, Adam Lallana was following Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers was practically out of the door and Morgan Schneiderlin was at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war.

‘Where was the message of hope and stability from the board?’ I cried. The previous season where the side had finished eight playing glorious passing football had finished full of optimism. The new one would start full of dread.

Saints fans were split. Many thought as I did, others pleaded for calm - though quite what shred of hope they were clinging on to other than blind footballing loyalty was beyond me. 

So it’s barely credible that 60 days later Saints are sitting third in the table and to top it all striker Graziano Pelle has been handed the player of the month award and Ronald Koeman is manager of the month. If ever there was a moment things should fall apart, this is probably it!

Per game Southampton have conceded fewer goals, made more tackles and more crosses than any other team in the league. Only Arsenal have had fewer shots against them.

Saints run of games has helped. Liverpool on the opening day was followed by West Brom, West Ham, Newcastle, Swansea and QPR.

Morgan Schneiderlin wanted to leave in the summer, but his decision to stay was monumental for the club 

The only black mark was the disappointing capitulation at White Hart Lane.

Koeman’s appointment was a masterstroke. People talk of ‘The Southampton Way’ – a focus on developing youngsters and playing attractive football.

But he’s added a self-belief, possibly passed on from his own legendary reputation as a player, which has given the team more grit than last year.

Alongside him has been the addition of some excellent players, particularly the Serb Dusan Tadic.

I’m delighted for Pelle – his match-winning overhead kick against QPR was the kind of spectacular finish that has been a rarity on the south coast since Matt Le Tissier retired.

But it’s the more defensive players that deserve much of the praise, not least Schneiderlin. His decision to stay was monumental, if a little controversial.

He was the heart of the team last year, and has proved the right person to build the new look side around.

Competition for places has helped, too. Schneiderlin, Jack Cork (who I remain convinced is the most-underrated player in the country), Victor Wanyama, Steven Davis and, when fit, James Ward-Prowse are battling it out for limited midfield places.

Nathaniel Clyne has developed into the player Saints fans knew he would, scoring goals and forcing himself in to the England squad.

And they’re saying it quietly down at St Mary’s, but things could get even better. New signing Saido Mane seems a bit of a maverick, but one with bags of potential still to be seen. There is more to come from centre back Toby Alderweireld, and it barely seems possible that all this has been achieved without Jay Rodriguez, who will be like having a new signing when he returns from a long injury lay-off.

The real test of what kind of season will be what happens at the end of November when over nine games Saints face Manchester United and Arsenal twice, Chelsea, Man City and Everton.

Everything is rosy on the south coast – if only we’d beaten Pochettino’s Spurs side a fortnight ago, things would have seemed very sweet indeed!
