A polygamist Israeli cult leader whose 21 wives bore him dozens of children has been convicted of a string of sex crimes.

Goel Ratzon was convicted of rape, incest and other offences, at the Tel Aviv District court after it emerged that he kept the harem of women in a state of 'near total obedience'.

But the court acquitted him of an enslavement charge, sparking cries of outrage in the courtroom.

The
 case shocked Israelis when details of the cult emerged in 2010.

Ratzon 
kept at least 21 'wives,' some of whom tattooed his name on their bodies
 along with images of the short 64-year-old with long white hair and 
beard.

The children they bore him were named after variations of his first name Goel, or 'savior' in Hebrew.

Yehudit Herman, who was part of the harem, told channel 2 television she had mixed feelings about the court's decisions.

She said she was 'really happy' that he was charged with the sex crimes.

'I know what damage went on there, there are really women who were hurt by him for the rest of their lives, small girls and women.'

She said she is disappointed that he wasn't charged with enslavement but that is what she assumed would happen as it was difficult to prove.

An Israeli court convicted the polygamist cult leader of sex crimes on Monday, after he kept a harem of women who bore him dozens of children in a state of near total obedience

'This wasn't regular slavery where someone's passport is taken away from them and they are locked up and they are physically deprived of things,' she said.

'This was spiritual slavery, mental slavery,' she said.

She said she was 17 years old when she met Ratzon, then 30 years her senior. Herman had lived with Ratzon for 12 years and had 5 children with him according to the station.

Another former member of the harem, identified by her first name Maayan in Israeli media, was outraged and tearfully cried out at the courthouse after the rulings.

'I was in totally slavery. If the state of Israel wouldn't have freed me I would have been serving a life sentence.'

A sentencing date was not immediately set.
