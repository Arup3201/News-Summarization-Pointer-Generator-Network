Boasting a four and a half star rating on YELP and four dollar signs, Alan Wong's, established in 1995, is no run-of-the-mill dinner spot. A single meal there once ran Obama and friends $75 a person before taking into account the cost of wine, which brought the price up to $105 each.

'Every time, it's a chicken skin moment,' Wong told the magazine of his experiences cooking for the president.

Wong also catered a luau for congressional leaders at the White House for Obama's first year as a resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
