The co-founders of popular instant messaging service Whatsapp have become a last-minute addition to this year's list of global billionaires.

Jan Koum and Brian Acton made Forbes' annual rich list in February after Facebook offered a total of $19 billion to buy their company.

The deal gives Koum a fortune of $6.8 billion, while partner Acton is said to be worth at least $3 billion according to Forbes.

Late addition: Whastsapp founders Brian Acton, left, and Jan Koum, right, made this year's list of global billionaires following an acquisition offer from Facebook in February. Facebook offered the pair $19 billion for the service, but the founders are set to get a total of $9.8 billion between them

However, neither made the top twenty list, which was topped by Microsoft founder Bill Gates with his $76 million fortune.

This year's list had the largest number of female billionaires ever, including:

Sheryl Sandberg
 is arguably the most famous of the 34 women who are new to the list 
this year, and she just made the cut with $1.05billion after Facebook's 
share price increased dramatically.

Nigerian fashion head turned oil magnate Folorunsho Alakija who is worth $2.5billion.

Denise Coates from the United Kingdom who made her $1.6billion in online gambling and developed the site Bet365.com.

Estee Lauder's granddaughters Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer and Jane Lauder have been added to the list.

Sandra Ortega Mera, the daughter of Zara owner Amancio Ortega, made the list after inheriting her mother's wealth following her death in August.

Other new faces on the 28th annual list:

Jan Koum from WhatsApp, $6.8billion

Brian Acton from WhatsApp, $3billion

Evan Williams from Twitter, $3billion

Kenneth Feld of Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, $1.8billion

Alexandre Grendene Bartelle owns the Brazilian shoe company that produces Havaianas flip flops, $1.5billion

Drew Houston, the CEO of tech company DropBox, $1.2billion

Vince McMahon from WWE, $1.2billion

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg made the most money in the world over the past 12 months, according to the Forbes report, and his net worth nearly doubled, going from 2013's
 estimate of $15.2billion to $28.5billion as a result of the social 
network's increasing share price.

Koum
 and Acton are among a list of 26 newcomers to the annual list, alongside Twitter's Evan Williams who has a fortune of $3billion.

Drew Houston, the CEO of tech company DropBox who made $1.2billion, and Alexandre Grendene Bartelle who amassed a fortune of $1.5 billion with his Brazilian shoe company that makes Havaianas flip flops also made the cut for the first time.

Gates held the title of 'richest man in the world' for 15 out of the past 20 years, but he was succeeded- briefly- by Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim Helu for the past four years.

Gates, who now spends most of his time in philanthropy, earned his spot back as his net worth increased by $9billion to $76billion after Microsoft's stock had a promising year, putting him ahead of Slim Helu who came in at $72billion.

Zara owner Amancio Ortega held onto the third place spot for the second year in a row and was followed by investor Warren Buffett and Oracle head Larry Ellison came in fifth place. 

The rest of the top ten show the power of American family connections, as sixth and seventh place went to Charles and David Koch respectively.

Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson came in
 eighth place, followed by Walmart heirs - with Christy Walton and family
 coming in ninth and her brother-in-law Jim Walton came in 10th.

Their relatives Alice and S. Robson Walton also got their own spots on the list, meaning that the Walton family was responsible for four of the top 15 billionaires in the world.

Christy
 Walton's high placement means that she holds onto the title as the 
richest woman in the world, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a 
great deal of change for women on this year's list.

Back at the top: Bill Gates was the 'richest man in the world' for 15 out of the past 20 years but was dethroned briefly by Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim up until now

Going up: Mark Zuckerberg's net worth nearly doubled to $28.5billion since Facebook's share price is now up 130 per cent over the past year

More women than ever were included this year, with 172 female billionaires on the list of 1,645.

That jump marks a 24 per cent increase from last year, as only 138 women were on the list in 2013.

One
 of the new female faces was that of Sheryl Sandberg who is one of the 
youngest self-made billionaires with a net worth of $1.05billion.

Like Zuckerberg, she was helped dramatically by the fact that the Facebook share price is now up 130 per cent.

Though
 the new wave of wealthy technology leaders made their presence known on
 this year's list, neither of the Facebook faces were in the top 20 with
 Zuckerberg just narrowly missing the cut off.

Titans of tech: Google co-founders Larry Page, 
left, and Sergey Brin, right, came in 17th and 19th with $32.3billion 
and $31.8billion respectively

Earning her spot: Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, 44, is one of the youngest self-made billionaire women and a new entry onto this year's list

Gates clearly led the way with Ellison 
not far behind, younger iterations like Google's Larry Page and Sergey 
Brin came in 17th and 19th place respectively.

They were interrupted along the way by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who came in 18th place with $32billion.

Aside from Sandberg, another first time mention was given to designer 
Michael Kors, whose fortune breached the billion dollar mark after he 
took his eponymous company public in 2011.

Though he is near the bottom of the list, retail giants were represented well in the top 20.

Between
 Ortega, H&M's Stefan Persson, and LVMH's Bernard Arnault and the 
four Walton relatives, there were seven retail billionaires in the top 
20.

By comparison, 
there were only six tech billionaires in the same subset, including 
Gates, Ellison and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

 1. Bill Gates, $76billion

2. Carlos Slim Helu, $72billion

3. Amancio Ortega, $64billion

4. Warren Buffett, $58.2billion

5. Larry Ellison, $48billion

6. Charles Koch, $40billion

7. David Koch, $40billion

8. Sheldon Adelson, $38billion

9. Christy Walton and family, $36.7billion

10. Jim Walton, $34.7billion

 

11. Liliane Bettencourt, $34.5billion

12. Stefan Persson, $34.4billion

13. Alice Walton, $34.3billion

14. S. Robson Walton, $34.2billion

15. Bernard Arnault, $33.5billion

16. Michael Bloomberg, $33billion

17. Larry Page, $32.3billion

18. Jeff Bezos, $32billion

21. Mark Zuckerberg, $28.5billion
