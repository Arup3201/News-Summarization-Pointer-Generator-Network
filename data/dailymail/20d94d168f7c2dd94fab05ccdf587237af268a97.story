Sex pest policeman: PC Christopher Robb, 30, started messaging the 19-year-old hours after she had given him a statement

A married police officer sent sleazy texts to a teenage girl hours after she had given him a statement about an alleged case of vandalism.

When the 19-year-old rejected Constable Christopher Robb's advances, he later sent her a message saying: 'You're missing out on the ride of your life.'

Robb, 30, who was stationed in Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, admitted sending a string of messages begging the young woman for sex.

He was fined at Falkirk Sheriff Court and now faces being sacked from his job with Police Scotland.

The court was told that Robb started pestering the victim via text just hours after he took the statement from her.

The first message he sent said: 'Hey gorgeous, how's you? You're so sexy, by the way.'

Four others followed the next day. They included: 'You horny?' And on the next day he texted: 'You sound hot.'

Graham McLachlan, prosecuting, told 
the court that Robb was a serving officer with the former Central 
Scotland Police force, now part of Police Scotland.

The depute fiscal said: 'He had to attend at the home of a witness to make inquiries about an allegation of vandalism.

'He took a statement from the witness and got access to her personal detail including her mobile telephone number.'

Mr McLachlan said when the young woman made it clear she wasn't interested, Robb texted her: 'Oh well. It's your loss.'

This was followed by: 'You're missing out on the ride of your life.'

This caused some people in the packed 
public benches to burst out laughing. Mr McLachlan said the matter was 
'brought to the attention of police.'

Robb, of Dunfermline, Fife, admitted sending messages which were grossly offensive in February last year but denied a further charge of illegally accessing the police computer.

His not guilty plea to this second charge was accepted by the prosecution.

Defence solicitor David Hunter said 
Robb, who has not committed an offence before, had been suspended from 
the force for over a year.

He said the texts had been sent when the officer 'was having problems at home, and was at a low ebb.'

He said Robb's marriage had suffered through his behaviour, which, he said, had been a 'one-off'.

Mr Hunter added: 'Matters have progressed and the couple are reconciled now.'

He said the officer was 'most 
apologetic to the complainer' and was now likely to lose his job, where 
he earned £1,200 after tax each month.

Sheriff John Mundy told Robb: 'Clearly this is a gross breach of trust and a significant failure by you in your duty.'

He fined Robb £1,000, reduced from £1,200 for pleading guilty and saving witnesses the ordeal of a trial.

A spokeswoman for Police Scotland's Forth Valley Division said: 'We are aware of the outcome of this case and the matter will now be subject to an internal misconduct process.'
