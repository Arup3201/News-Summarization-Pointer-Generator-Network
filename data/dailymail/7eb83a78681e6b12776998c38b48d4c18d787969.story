Liverpool have announced that New Balance will become their kit supplier from next season in a multi-year partnership that has become the biggest in the history of the club.

Warrior, Liverpool's current supplier, is a subsidiary of New Balance, meaning the switch does not compromise the current six-year deal that has been in place from the beginning of the 2012-13 season.

The  multi-year contract announced on Thursday means Liverpool's entire packaging for additional merchandising could be worth a potential £300million.

The current  kit supplier for Liverpool is Warrior, whose deal at the club started in the 2012-13 season

'We are thrilled to announce this partnership with one of the world's leading sportswear brands, which is a record-breaking deal for the club,' Liverpool's chief commercial officer Billy Hogan said.

'New Balance has over 100 years of heritage and a global footprint... they also have a presence in many countries across the world, which will all feature LFC kit. We are very excited about joining forces with them,' Hogan added.
