Joe Hart is Manchester City's hero despite their Champions League defeat to Barcelona after saving a stoppage time Lionel Messi penalty.

The England international kept his side in with a shout ahead of the second leg at the Nou Camp after denying the two time Ballon d'Or winner.

Hart believes City's second half performance is something then they can build on and thinks his penalty save could prove to be crucial.

The England international saved Lionel Messi's penalty in second half stoppage time to keep the tie alive

Talking to ITV he said: 'I hope so [that the penalty save could prove crucial]. We will go there with a great group of fans, belief and we will have a right go.

'We pressed until the first goal and panicked a bit. We regrouped second half, put a lot of pressure on and were good for our goal and maybe good for a result tonight.

'The occasion did not get to us, sometimes things go against you. It is 2-1 and we go there with belief.'

Hart was beaten by a Suarez double the last time they played each other at the World Cup and the England goalkeeper praised his rival. 

'Luis Suarez is a fantastic player, he took his goal well.'

'It's not the result we wanted but the tie is still unfinished. And as usual we'll fight 'til the end. C'mon, City!  

The formidable three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar were dangerous throughout but the controversial former Liverpool player stole the headlines.

He replied: 'I think so [City have a chance of going through] . If they lost the game 3-1 that is really difficult for them but 2-1 is a good result for them.'

Spanish international Andres Iniesta allied his teammates comments that City shouldn't be ruled out but was pleased with the result.

He said: 'We feel like we've taken a big step tonight, but it isn't over yet.'
