Jessica Silva  has been found guilty of manslaughter for the stabbing death of her estranged drug-using partner following years of abuse.

Ms Silva, from Marrickville in Sydney's inner-west, lay down in the dock and began screaming and crying after the jury delivered their verdict following five days of anxious waiting.

Ms Silva was accused of stabbing James Polkinghorne, 28, up to five times outside her family home in Marrickville in Sydney's inner west on Mother's Day in 2012.

Jessica Silva leaving NSW Supreme Court after being found guilty of manslaughter for the stabbing death of her estranged partner following years of abuse

The 24-year-old pleaded not guilty to murder on the basis of self defence, with the Supreme Court hearing she had suffered years of abuse at the hands of her boyfriend of four years. 

Over the course of her trial, Silva repeatedly broke down as the court was played phone conversations in which her estranged partner abuses and insults her, before threatening to 'cave her face in'.

In one text sent to Silva on the day he was stabbed, Mr Polkinghorne wrote: 'I hope your mother gets poisoned by the flowers that you give her and you get gang raped.' 

Ms Silva claims that Mr Polkinghorne attacked her outside her family home, fighting with her brother and father while she ran inside.

She claims he punched her and ripped her pants before she retrieved a knife to defend herself with, stabbing him up to five times, reported 9 News.

Mr Polkinghorne died later from wounds to the back and shoulder. 

The court found her not guilty of the murder of Mr Polkinghorne but guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter.

Minutes before the jury came back into court the 24-year-old was crying and hugging supporters as they became increasingly distressed by the news that a verdict was to be delivered.

Ms Silva's father allegedly told Mr Polkinghorne's mother 'I will never forgive you', telling her that she 'could have stopped this'.

Silva, who has been on bail throughout the trial and has been sitting next to her lawyer, was then asked to step into the dock for the first time.

The Sydney Morning Herald reports that a jury of seven men and five women were not able to reach a unanimous decision on Ms Silva's guilt.

Judge Clifton Hoeben gave the jury further instructions before they returned with their verdict for the 24-year-old.

After the jury left the room, Justice Clifton Hoeben said he would be considering a large 'spectrum' of sentences for Silva from non-custodial to custodial. 

'I have a completely open mind,' he said.

He said Silva's bail should be continued before she returns to court for sentencing in February. 

The crown said the case was 'not a popularity contest' and no matter what Mr Polkinghorne had done while he was alive, disputes were not solved by force.

But Silva's barrister, Gregory Scragg, said all she had ever wanted was for Mr Polkinghorne to stop hurting her.

At the time of his death, Mr Polkinghorne was the suspect in another murder case, reported The ABC. 

Evidence from the murder investigation of Nikolas Argiropoulos was used as evidence in Ms Silva's trial.

Her trial heard recordings of a series of frantic phone calls she made to her brother Miguel in the hours before Mr Polkinghorne died. 

Ms Silva arrived at court on Thursday morning after five days of waiting for a jury verdict

Ms Silva was accused of stabbing James Polkinghorne, 28, up to five times outside her family home in Marrickville in Sydney's inner west on Mother's Day in 2012

According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Mr Polkinghore texted Ms Silva on Mother's Day calling her a 'f---ing slut', saying she deserved to be raped and threatening to come over to smash up her parents' house.

'He reckons he's gonna come and kill me, right now,' Silva says in one call to her brother Miguel. 

When Miguel tells her to call the cops, an increasingly distressed Silva replies: 'Why do you think I don't tell them so he can bash me up all the f***ing time. I'm sick of it ... and I don't know what to f***ing do any more.'

'Is there anyone we can f***ing contact ... to get him killed or something?' she asks, later adding: 'Don't worry I'll f***ing stab him myself'.  

When Mr Polkinghorne arrived outside the family home that night, Miguel told the court he was 'screaming and carrying on' and that his sister was afraid for her and her family's life.

When Miguel went outside with his sister in an attempt to calm the situation, he alleged Mr Polkinghorne came quickly towards him.

'He tried to punch me. I think when I put my hand up, and he broke my finger,' Miguel added.

Moments later, the two men were on the ground with Mr Polkinghorne on top, grabbing Miguel near his throat, the court heard.  

'Was he screaming out, `I'm going to get you, you f***ing c*** ... I'm going to kill youse (sic)'?' defence barrister Gregory Scragg asked.

'Yeah,' Miguel replied.

It wasn't until their father came outside to help wrestle Mr Polkinghorne to the ground that he saw blood everywhere and noticed the 28-year-old had a gash to his head, the court heard. 

Miguel said his sister was the only person he saw with a knife that night.

She allegedly stabbed him four or five times to the back, shoulder and head and he died on the road while Miguel and Ms Silva's father restrained him.

In the weeks before Mr Polkinghorne's death, Miguel told the court the 28-year-old had become increasingly paranoid from the drug 'ice'.

'The drugs had gotten to him really bad.'
