More than 10,000 Latvians rushed to withdraw deposits from the 
country's largest bank after rumour spread that it was in financial 
crisis.

The rumours that Swedbank was facing legal and liquidity problems 
in Estonia and Sweden saw thousands of panic-stricken people queueing outside cash machines on 
Sunday.

Maris Mancinskis, Swedbank's chief executive slammed the rumours as 
'absurd' and said in a statement that the bank was functioning normally.

He added that all deposit holders would have full access to their money via 
bank machines and branch offices.

Mancinskis told LNT television that the rumours started last week and 
proliferated over the weekend, culminating in Sunday's rush to bank 
machines.

Kristine Jakubovska, a spokeswoman for Swedbank, said that depositors
 had withdrawn 24 million lats (Â£29m) by Monday morning, or about
 1.5 per cent of all deposits in the bank, according to data from the 
Latvian Commercial Bank Association at the end of September.

The rumours, which were reportedly spread via Twitter, come at a time
 that Latvians are particularly sensitive to speculation about banks' 
health.

Latvijas Krajbanka, the country's 10th largest bank, was nationalised
 last month after regulators discovered evidence of massive fraud 
allegedly carried out by the bank's former owner, Russian businessman 
Vladimir Antonov.

Customers were deprived of access to their funds for days.

And three years ago the country's second largest bank, Parex Bank, 
entered technical default and had to be taken over by the government, 
which in turn forced Latvia to appeal to international creditors and the
 European Union for a 7.5 billion euro bailout.

Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis told journalists that the rumours 
were spread maliciously with the intent to harm Latvia's banking system,
 the Baltic News Service reported.

Interior Minister Rihards Kozlovskis 
said that police have launched an investigation into the source of the rumours.

Spreading false rumours which threaten the stability of the banking 
system is a criminal offence in Latvia, with a sentence of two years in 
jail.

The rumours were contained to Latvia and did not spread to neighbouring
 Estonia and Lithuania, which also have affiliates of the 
Swedish-controlled Swedbank.

Swedbank passed the European Banking Authority's most recent stress test, the results of which were announced in July.

The Latvian branch of Swedbank had assets of 3.8 billion lats (Â£4.6billion) as of September 30, or nearly one-fifth of the country's banking 
assets.
