A 20-year-old woman who was attacked for five hours by her baseball-bat wielding boyfriend has been left terrified about his release from prison after only six months, she revealed today.

Kaylin Mauchlen endured daily beatings during her nine-month relationship with Luke Strain, 21, suffering extensive bruising, a fractured arm, blood loss, a black eye, tissue damage and concussion.

Miss Mauchlen, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, claimed that during his rages, Strain even subjected their kitten Misty to a beating - fracturing two of her ribs, breaking her leg and splitting her nose.

Bruising: Miss Mauchlen, of Shrewsbury, claimed Strain had been abusive to her throughout their relationship

Strain was jailed for 16 months at Shrewsbury Crown Court last month after he admitted assault, but he will be released in March next year after completing a programme to ensure his early release.

Miss Mauchlen said: ‘I lived in complete fear of Luke. I ended up in hospital twice, and he even battered our little kitten Misty. But once the beatings stopped, he would kiss my bruises better after he had beat me and act like what he was doing was right.

‘He was brain-washing me into thinking that his behaviour was acceptable and that I should just accept the beatings. Almost every evening I would get a beating from him because of something that had gone on through the day.

‘I would say something that he didn’t like and all he did was look at me and I knew that I was going to get hit that night. I was constantly walking on egg shells, worried about how quickly his mood would change and knowing he would attack me if I did anything wrong.’

On one occasion Strain beat Miss Mauchlen
with a baseball bat in a five-hour ordeal, forcing her to lock herself 
in the bathroom until it was safe for her to come out.

She said: ‘I was trying to leave him and he went mad. He picked up the baseball and just started swinging it at me - forcing me to fall to the ground. There was nothing I could do to stop it. I was terrified.

‘At one point he pressed a Stanley knife against my neck and was strangling me and I just wanted him to kill me so that I would be out of pain.’

Miss Mauchlen claimed Strain had been abusive to her throughout their -relationship, isolating her from friends and family and subjecting her to beatings on an almost daily basis.

She said: ‘I didn’t want to admit what had happened and I wasn’t brave enough to seek help from a shelter. When I finally escaped from him I ran to the nearest place I could think which was a library and asked the librarian to help me.

‘She was so shocked at how I looked that she rang the police straight away and they came to collect me and take me to hospital. I was terrified that I would walk out of the library and he would be standing there waiting to finish me off.’

Difficulties: Miss Mauchlen has been unable to go back to work as a waitress after the attack left her so weak that she has had to have extensive physiotherapy to strengthen her muscles. Bruises on her body are pictured

She said: ‘After he had assaulted me for five hours, hit me with a baseball bat, battered me, I had to hide in the bathroom to escape him but thankfully I was helped by nurses at the hospital as they told me I would only escape this if I pressed charges.

'Once the beatings stopped, he would kiss my bruises better after he had beat me and act like what he was doing was right'

Kaylin Mauchlen

‘My friends and family had told me to walk away from him so many times but I was so naive and he always threatened to hurt me if I tried to leave him.’

‘I still have horrible nightmares about the attacks and I am in a lot of pain with my knee and my arm after the damage he inflicted on me with a baseball bat.

‘After what he did to me, I cannot believe he is being released so soon. There is no justice any more. He will be out of prison so soon and will be able to carry on his life but I still have the physical and mental scars he has left behind.’

Strain pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was imprisoned on October 16.
