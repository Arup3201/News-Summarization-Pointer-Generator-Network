Boris Johnson's plans for an island airport on the Thames might sound ambitious, but these drawings prove the idea has been at least 80 years in the making.

Vintage architects' designs unearthed today show how floating hubs like 'Boris Island', with at least four runways, were already being planned in the 1930s.

The Mayor of London has been demanding the grand idea of an island airport made out of landfill with superfast links to London.

Brave New York world: This 1931 design for the centre of the Big Apple shows how airport docks should be built for the metropolis

Eye opening: The wonderfully named Charles Clever argued for an airport to be built on London's roofs while in Detroit they argued it should be in top of a City Hall

But it appears pre-Second World War architects had ideas even more dazzling and ahead of their time, which included placing an airport on top of city centre buildings in London.

Designers in New York also argued for a huge transport terminal in water, with an airstrip on top and a shipping port below.

In Detroit planners suggested a an airport was built in the sky above their City Hall.

This month the Mr Johnson underlined his commitment to a futuristic estuary airport, either on the edge of the Thames or right in its heart.

Revolutionary: This spinning airport conceived by a French designer was planned so it could sit on the top of any major city, this plan said

Very similar: This one from New York even looks like current plans for an estuary airport in London, while North Beach Airport off Long Island would have had four runways too

His first choice is Sir Norman Foster’s plan for an airport on Kent's Isle of Grain.

Mr Johnson says it would be able to support more than 375,000 new jobs by 2050 and add £742billion to the value of goods and services produced in the UK.

Planes would fly in over the sea into the four-runway 'Foster Island', which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers and include an international railway station, which would include a service to Waterloo in 26 minutes.

The Boris Island plan, designed by Global firm Gensler, would be artificially created from landfill in the heart of the estuary, and would be two miles north of the Isle of Sheppey.

Ferries would link the site to Kent and Essex while a railway bridge could connect it to the mainland.

Vision: Foster Island (pictured) on the Isle of Grain has today been backed by the Mayor of London above his own Boris Island plan because of its proximity to London

New favourite idea: Boris has backed the four-runway 'Foster Island' (pictured) in the Thames Estuary airport, which would be capable of handling up to 180million passengers a year on the Isle of Grain in Kent

Elaborate plan: The Isle of Grain's proposed international railway station, which would include a service to Waterloo in 26 minutes

The final 'compromise' idea is an enlarged Stansted, as the Mayor is desperate to stop a third runway at Heathrow.

He is so bent on preventing it, that he'd like to buy the west London site for £15billion to create a new borough for 250,000 residents.

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'The UK needs to take a bolder approach than ever before to respond to our shortage of world-class hub airport capacity. And a four runway hub airport in either the outer or inner estuary or at Stansted is both credible and deliverable. It is necessary to ensure that London and the UK can continue to compete at the highest level in the world.'
