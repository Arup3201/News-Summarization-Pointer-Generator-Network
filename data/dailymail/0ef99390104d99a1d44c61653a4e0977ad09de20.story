Alexander Wang's highly-anticipated diffusion collection for H&M hit stores in Australia on Thursday, with the menswear pieces selling out in just three hours.

Before H&M had even opened in the rest of the world, Wang’s black and grey line in Australia had been snapped up by over 800 people who queued outside the Sydney and Melbourne stores.

The partnership between Wang and H&M was first announced at Coachella festival in the US, in April, and has been touted as one of the hottest high street collaborations ever.

When the stores began trading at 7.00 am on Thursday, some frenzied fashion fans had been queuing from 6:00 pm the night before to get their hands on the clothes which are priced between $30-350.

A grey cropped grey sweat was the top seller when H&M in Melbourne’s GPO centre and H&M in the Macquarie Centre in North Ryde, Sydney, threw open their doors.

Australians were the first to get their hands on the garbs and the Alexander Wang x H&M collaboration is the first designer collection available for purchase in Australia branches of the Swedish retailer.

The American designer is famous for his love of street style and sportswear and joins fashion giants Versace, Karl Lagerfeld, Stella McCartney and Marni in collaborating with H&M.

The androgynous range reflects the designer's signature sports luxe vibe, coming in a sombre colour palette of black, grey and white.

Voluminous coats are paired with sporty leggings and beanies for both men and women, giving an urban, minimalist look.

The range is described as capturing ‘the speed of the city, mixing sports and performance to create a new urban wardrobe’.

In Sydney H&M chartered a bus to take shoppers from the CBD to the new Macquarie Centre

A statement said: ‘Wang’s first ever versatile performance wear wardrobe is to be worn on the street, in the gym, at the club.’

Parkour performers, beatboxers and break-dancers were outside the Melbourne store to entertain the waiting crowds.

And in Sydney H&M chartered a bus to take shoppers from the CBD to the new Macquarie Centre.

Once the whole range sells out there will be no restocking.
