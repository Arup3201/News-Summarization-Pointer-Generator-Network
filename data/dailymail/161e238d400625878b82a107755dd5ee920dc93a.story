The weather kills at 
least 2,000 Americans each year and nearly two-thirds of the deaths are 
from the cold, according to a new government report.

That
 may surprise some people, the researchers acknowledged. Hurricanes, 
tornadoes and heat waves 'get more publicity, for some reason, than 
cold-related deaths,' said Deborah Ingram, one of the report's authors.

The
 report released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention analyzed U.S. deaths attributed to the cold, the heat, 
storms, floods and lightning.

The weather kills at least 2,000 Americans each year and nearly two-thirds of the deaths are from the cold, according to a new government report

It used national death certificate 
information for five years.

The report found:

-
 Of the 10,649 deaths attributed to the weather, about 63 per cent were 
tied to exposure to the cold or hypothermia.

Those who more often fall 
victim to the cold include the homeless, alcoholics, those who take part
 in wilderness activities and winter sports, and fragile people already 
fighting illnesses who live in under-heated homes.

-
 About 31 per cent of the deaths were caused by heat, heat stroke or sun 
stroke. The remaining 6 percent were blamed on storms, floods or 
lightning.

Over five years, 63 per cent of the 10,649 deaths attributed to the weather were tied to exposure to the cold or hypothermia

- More than two-thirds of 
weather-related deaths were men and boys, and men were twice as likely 
as women to die from storms, floods or lightning strikes.

And people 65 
and older had much higher death rates than younger people, perhaps 
because it's harder for them to endure temperature extremes, the 
researchers said.

- The highest heat-related 
death rates were in cities and very rural areas; the most isolated areas
 also had the highest rates related to the cold and to storms, floods 
and lightning. Low-income counties had higher weather-related death 
rates than high-income counties.

That could be due to people in poor 
rural or urban places lacking heating, air conditioning or help during 
blizzards or heat waves, the researchers said.

Cold victims include the homeless, alcoholics, those who take part in wilderness activities and winter sports, and fragile people already fighting illnesses who live in under-heated homes

-
 For blacks, the heat-related death rate was about 2.5 times higher than
 the rate for whites, and about twice as high as the Hispanic rate.

Blacks also died at a higher rate from the cold. That finding may be 
tied to higher concentrations of low-income blacks in large cities or 
very rural areas.

Also, blacks might be more vulnerable to weather 
extremes because they have more heart disease and other chronic health 
problems. Whites, however, died at twice the rate of blacks from floods,
 storms and lightning strikes.
