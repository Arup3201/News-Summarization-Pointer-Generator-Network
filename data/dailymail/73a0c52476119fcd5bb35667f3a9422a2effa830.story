After his heroic performance in the Nou Camp, Joe Hart came out in defence of his manager Manuel Pellegrini, claiming he deserves to keep his job.

Manchester City keeper Hart, who made an incredible 10 saves to limit Barcelona to a 1-0 win on Wednesday, admitted that his team-mates were feeling the pressure of speculation about their futures after another European failure.

But the England No 1 insisted the players are fully behind their manager as they seek to end their campaign on a high.

'We back our manager,' said Hart. 'He is a great manager and brought us two trophies last year. 

'Now we have nine games to win, and that's what we hope to do.

'It's always going to be the same at City, for all the players. We appreciate that if we don't win everyone will be speculated about. You have to be strong inside.'

Hart was easily City's best player at the Nou Camp, and his immense contribution stopped Barcelona adding to Ivan Rakitic's goal. 

Barcelona coach Luis Enrique said: 'The score could have been a rout. Hart was really on it towards the end. We had a lot of chances, which is not normal in this type of game. We deserved to win by a bigger goal difference.' 

Manuel Pellegrini has been beaten four times by Barcelona since becoming Manchester City manager
