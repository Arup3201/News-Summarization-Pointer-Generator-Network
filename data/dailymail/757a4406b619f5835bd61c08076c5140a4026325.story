Bomb disposal experts detonated a giant World War II mine found off the British coast - after a fisherman caught it in his nets.

Stunned Ben Cooper discovered the 70-year-old Nazi device while fishing in Herne Bay, Kent, on Thursday afternoon.

Four members of the Royal Navy bomb disposal unit based at Portsmouth detonated the device around 3pm this afternoon - sending plumes of water shooting more than 160ft in the air.

Officers detonated it just after 3pm, with plumes of water rising 80 feet in the air

Petty Officer Diver Ken Smith said: 'A fisherman has brought up a land mine, that is probably from the Second World War, in his fishing net.

'He has brought it back towards the shore and it is in four metres of water, two miles north of the coast.

'We are going to dispose of it in position.'

The Coastguard set up a one-mile exclusion zone around the mine.

Royal Navy spokesman Simon Smith said: 'The location was fortunate because it was not in the way of shipping lanes and we did not have to enforce any diversions.'

The detonation comes two months after
a pair of men were spotted carrying away what is believed to be an 
undetonated bomb from the Cold War.

The
2ft-long shells were found washed up at Warbarrow Bay, Dorset.  The 
area is part of the 7,000-acre Lulworth Military Range used by the Army 
for tank firing practice.

And the detonation at sea came three months after a homeowner discovered bombs from World War II tucked inside a kicchen cupboard in his new property.

The 24-year-old was giving his parents the guided tour of the house in Borth y Gest, near Porhmadog, in north west Wales, when he found the 16lb artillery shell which was packed with high explosives.

Police officers in Porthmadog alerted the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team which carried out a controlled explosion.
