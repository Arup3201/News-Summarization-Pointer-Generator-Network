The Queen Mary 2 became the largest ship to visit Milford Sound in New Zealand today, sailing into the World Heritage-listed Fiordland National Park on the latest stop in a round-the-world voyage.

The 151,400-tonne Cunard flagship cruised the waters of the fjord in the south-west of New Zealand's South Island, which featured heavily in the Lord Of The Rings films.

Author Rudyard Kipling was so taken with the area that he called it the eighth wonder of the world.

It is within the boundaries of the Fiordland National Park and the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage site, protected for its outstanding natural beauty.

The Cunard flagship, which is the largest passenger cruiser in the world, sailed into Milford Sound for the latest stop in a round-the-world voyage

The 151,400-tonne liner cruised the waters of Milford Sound as well as Dusky Sound further along the coast of New Zealand's South Island

The ocean liner reaches a height of 200ft above the water but was dwarfed by the stunning landscape of Milford Sound

The liner set off on its round-the-world voyage from Southampton on January 10 and will return to Britain on April 26 after touring the coasts of Australia, South Africa and Spain

The liner reached a height of 200ft above the water but was dwarfed by the stunning scenery.

Unesco, which certifies world heritage sites, describes Milford Sound as ‘the least-disturbed tenth of New Zealand's land mass’.

It said that ‘the landscape in this 
park has been shaped by successive glaciations into fjords, rocky 
coasts, towering cliffs, lakes and waterfalls.’

Although it is one of the wettest 
inhabited places in the world, it is New Zealand's most popular tourist 
destination, and it's not hard to see why.

After its stop at Milford Sound, the Queen Mary 2 set sail for Sydney - the next stop in its 106 day-long world voyage.

It set off from Southampton on January 10 and will return to port on April 26 after further stops in South Africa and Spain.
