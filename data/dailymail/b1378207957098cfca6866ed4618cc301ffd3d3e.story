Authorities in Colorado believe a bad batch of synthetic marijuana combined with a Phish concert is responsible for the hospitalization of more than 60 people over the past week.

Denver and Colorado Springs-area hospitals first started noticing more patients being admitted to the emergency room suffering from a bad reaction to the drug 'Black Mamba' last Tuesday.

But that number grew to more than 60 over the Labor Day weekend, corresponding with a three-day Phish concert at Dick's Sporting Goods Stadium in Denver.

Outbreak: Hospitals in Denver and Colorado Springs have reported more than 60 people being admitted for bad reactions to the synthetic marijuana 'Black Mamba' over the past week

Factor: Health officials believe the three day Phish concert at Denver's Dick's Sporting Goods Arena may have contributed in the outbreak

Spread at the concert? The band's performances are known to incite marijuana usage

'Black Mamba', also known as 'K2' or 'Spice', is a synthetic form of marijuana produced when a chemical substance which mimics the effects of THC is sprayed on herbs.

The drug used to be legal, but has since been outlawed in may states, including Colorado, for the sometimes fatal side effects and the fact that it can be 800 times more potent than THC.Â 

The synthetic drug can be purchased on the black market, or sometimes found in liquor stores marketed as incense.

Charge nurse Amanda Puhal of the University of Colorado Hospital has worked in emergency rooms for 11 years, and says she has never witnessed an outbreak this bad.

Denver Health Medical Center has reported patients being admitted screaming and violent - completely out of control.

Bad batch: Patients have been admitted to University of Colorado Hospital, above, and others with reactions such as hallucinating or worse - not breathing

Others have been admitted unresponsive or having seizures. Doctors have put several patients on life support and some are in comas.

'There have been reported fatalities in other states,' emergency room doctor Jeffrey Sankoff told 7News. 'In our cases, abusers have been out in traffic, they've jumped off buildings. Agitation to the point where they're totally out of mind.'

Medical toxicologist Dr Kennon Heard said he wouldn't be surprised if someone dies in this outbreak.

'The truth is that these people are sick enough that if they didn't get health care, there's a good chance that some of them wouldn't have made it,' Heard said.

While Denver doctors say it's clear that there's a bad batch of the synthetic drug being distributed, the Phish concert this past weekend may also be to blame for the spike in emergency room visits, as the band's performances are known to incite marijuana usage.
