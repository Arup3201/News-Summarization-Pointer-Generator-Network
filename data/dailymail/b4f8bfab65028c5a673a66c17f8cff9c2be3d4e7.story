A former New York financier found guilty of earning almost a million dollars from insider trading, who famously bolted from a press pack and lost his flip-flops, is hoping to become a North Dakota truck driver.

Michael Lucarelli, 52, pleaded guilty to a federal securities fraud charge last September and now hopes to begin a new life on the open road, driving trucks, it's been reported.

It's understood that he is working towards earning a truck driver's licence while living in North Dakota with his brother.

However, he may not realise his dream as he faces several years in jail and may have to pay back almost $900,000 that he obtained fraudulently.

A sentencing memo said he expects 'to be licensed and to drive tractor trailers', according to the New York Daily News.

It also said he 'will never again trade another stock or work in any stock related field'.

Mr Lucarelli was ridiculed last August when he ran from media waiting for him outside a court in New York following a hearing for his case.

He ran out of his sandals racing down the sidewalk in a tank top and slacks, earning him a mocking 'Moment of Zen' on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.

In a September hearing he described his crime to U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, Lucarelli apologized and paused briefly to cry.

He had used non-public information from drafts of press releases to earn nearly a million dollars.

He said long hours at Manhattan-based investor relations firm Lippert/Heilshorn & Associates Inc., where he was director of market intelligence, his failure to take vacation for two years and complications from Crohn's disease that led to a dependence on  cocaine, were in part to blame for his illegal trading over the last year.

He said commissions for his work sometimes were not paid in a timely manner.

'Fueled by anger at not getting paid and a dependence on drugs, I made a serious mistake,' Lucarelli said. He added that it was the first time he had run afoul of the law in his quarter of a century in the business.

'I apologize to the court for my decision to trade on material nonpublic information,' he said. 'I wasn't strong enough to resist. I'm very remorseful.'

The judge asked several questions about the trades he carried out in the securities of 13 of the firm's clients.

'Because of the physical pain and the dependence on drugs, I can't remember,' he said in one answer.

In a release, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in September: 'For using his company's and clients' secrets for his own personal gain, he now faces time in federal prison and the forfeiture of over $900,000 that he unlawfully obtained.'

His attorney Patrick W. McGinley said Lucarelli has no money and will await sentencing at the home of his brother in North Dakota.

The lawyer said his client has 'no ability to live here anymore.'

He is due for sentencing next month and could face up to four years in jail.
