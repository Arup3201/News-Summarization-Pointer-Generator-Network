Her sexually provocative dance moves and pop star lifestyle may not endear her to parents.

But Beyoncé’s ‘bling-a-ding’ image makes her great role model for young girls, the employment minister has argued.

Former GMTV presenter Esther McVey, who was promoted to the Cabinet in July, has praised the pop star for making a success of her career.

She told the Sunday Times: ‘What I like to see is people like Beyoncé. Here is a woman who is bling-a-ding. Not only does she look like that and act like that — I’ve seen her perform and I was blown away — but she is at the top of her profession.’

Beyoncé, 33, shot to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of R&B group Destiny’s Child. Since then she has had a lucrative solo career that has made her and her rapper husband Jay Z the highest-earning celebrity couple in the world, with profits of £59million last year.

But despite being mother to a two-year-old daughter Blue Ivy, the American star has been accused of setting children a bad example.

Role model? In 2010, a perfume advert featuring the singer was banned from being shown before the watershed because it was ‘too sexually provocative

In 2010, a perfume advert featuring her was banned from being shown before the watershed because it was ‘too sexually provocative’.

The Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) said it received 14 complaints that the advert was offensive and unsuitable for broadcast when children might be watching.

Miss McVey said she has no shame about her own colourful past which includes a saucy photo-shoot in 1999 when she was launching her TV career.

She insisted: ‘I’m not embarrassed. That is part of my life, part of my journey in life. I’ve worked in business, in TV, in construction. They’ve all made me the person I am.’

Single: Earlier this year, the Tory MP revealed that despite 'loving' children she has not met the right person to have them with

Earlier this year, the Tory MP revealed that despite ‘loving’ children she has not met the right person to have them with.

In her latest interview, she said: ‘It wasn’t a sacrifice for work. I never got married, but it wasn’t a decision, it just didn’t happen. I wanted to have children, but it didn’t happen.

‘Then, the older I got, the less important it became for me.’

Asked if she thought she still may have children, the 47-year-old added: ‘It’s not looking promising.’

During the interview Miss McVey revealed her role model was fellow Liverpudlian Rose Heilbron, the first woman QC.

She also named other high fliers including Eileen Collins, the first female astronaut to command a space shuttle, Debbie Moore, the chief executive of Pineapple and the first woman to set up a PLC, and Clara Furse who is the first CEO of the London Stock Exchange.

Other women Miss McVey admires include young scientist of the year Emily Cummins, war correspondent Christina Lamb and Olympic gymnast Beth Tweddle.
