From a black and white toilet seat to a life-sized family of Friesians in her front garden, this pub landlady has spent 17 years and £10,000 turning her home into a shrine to the humble dairy cow.

Muriel Edwin, 62, from Hulland Ward in Derbyshire, said her fondness for cow-themed trinkets 'snowballed' over the years from the odd clock or pair of slippers into a staggering collection of more than 2,000 items. 

The widow's hoard has now grown so large that almost every inch of her flat above the Black Horse pub is now stuffed with cuddly toys, pictures, ceramic figurines, and even a cow-shaped kettle.

Cow crazy: Derbyshire pub landlady Muriel Edwin, 62, has spent around £10,000 on cow memorabilia - including these three life-sized ceramic models

Passion: The widow is so obsessed with collecting cows that every room of her flat above the pub is stuffed with pictures, cuddly toys, clocks, mugs and slippers

Mrs Edwin's collection - which includes three life-sized ceramic cows and a calf on her front lawn - is now so well known she has even had a coach-load of tourists knock on her door to ask for a tour of her home.

'My obsession 
started off with a mug here and a pair of slippers there and it just 
snowballed when I moved into the pub,' said Mrs Edwin - who said her fondness for cows once earned her the nickname 'Moo'.'I've just always loved cows, and have spent thousands and thousands on them over the years - well over £10,000.

'But it's my hobby, it makes me happy and it's not hurting anyone - so I keep on collecting,' she said.'My nickname used to be Moo and my maiden name was Brown, so you can imagine the "how now brown cow" jokes I used to get.'

Obsession: From black and white mugs to miniature bovine ornaments, the 62-year-old's home is a shrine to the humble dairy cow

During the 17 years Mrs Edwin has
lived at the Black Horse pub, she has 
crammed her three bedroomed flat above the pub with Britain's largest 
cow collection.She said; 'My home is full of them, there is still space to sit when the family 
come round, but only just. They have started creeping down into the pub.
It's no good having them and not showing them off.'

The widow even has a cow print toilet seat - and two spares in a box, just in case one should break.

'Thousands and thousands have been spent
on them over the years- £50 here and £100 there, it all adds up,' she 
said of her collection.

'It just snowballed': Everything from clocks to crockery to bed spreads and even a toilet seat are emblazoned with cows at Mrs Edwin's Derbyshire home

Hobby: The hearth in front of Mrs Edwin's fireplace is home to enough cows to fill a farmyard

Mrs Edwin said the family of ceramic cows standing proudly outside the pub - each of which cost around £1,000 - had become a 'landmark' in the village.

'I fully accept that if I move house, not all of the cows would be able to come with me, but I could never get rid of the big ones outside, which my husband bought me. I don't expect any new neighbours would like them, but they would just have to put up with it.

'The amount of times the big cows have been photographed is out of this world. Kids love them, adults love them- I've even had whole coach parties spot the cows outside and come upstairs to see my collection.'

Mrs Edwin said she has no plans to change the name of the pub to what some might say would be a more appropriate title; the Black Cow.

'You have to keep some things separate. They aren't work related, the cows are the switch off mode,' she said.

'I love the quirkiness of it, and it's nice at the end of the day to be surrounded by the cows, which are completely different from my work.'
