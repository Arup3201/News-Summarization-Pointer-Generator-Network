When popping to the corner shop, most people come back with nothing more than a loaf of bread and a pint of milk.

But one mystery shopper in Burnley walked away with £4million after winning big on a £10 Lottery scratchcard - making it Britain's biggest ever win on one of the card games.

Mohammed Ikramm, who runs Welcome News in Briercliffe Road where the card was bought, said he sold the customer one £10 card, but the man didn't win.

Mr Ikramm added that the man then pulled out his last £20 note, saying he wanted two more cards - and pocketed £4million on the last one.

Mr Ikramm described the winner as a regular in his shop, but refused to name the man.

He said: 'He bought one and didn't win then he pulled out £20 and said it was his last and he wanted two more.

'The second one didn't win but on the third he scratched it and it showed the top prize of four million. He was so happy.'

There have been just four £4m prizes on scratchcards in circulation in Britain and there was a one in 4,232,860 chance of winning the top prize.

Mr Ikramm described the man as a regular customer at his shop (pictured), but refused to name him. At £4million, the mystery man's prize is the largest in the UK ever to be won on a scratchcard

The life-changing win comes after it was announced rugby league fan Simon Rustage won £250,000 every year until 2028 on a scratchcard bought in Warrington.

He won the top prize on a £10 Mega Rich and said he plans to spend some of his winnings on a car and a season ticket for his beloved Warrington Wolves.
