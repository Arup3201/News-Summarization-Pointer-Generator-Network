An adult film actress who fractured her foot after being hurled from the roof of a Hollywood mansion by a millionaire poker player now appears to be intent on making him pay for what he did.

A shocking video captured porn star Janice Griffith, 18, being tossed naked into a pool by Dan Blizerian, dubbed 'Instagram's Biggest Playboy,' during a photo-shoot at his sprawling Hollywood Hills home  Wednesday.

But the stunt went awry when on her way down, Griffith seemingly grabbed onto Blizerian's shirt and hit one of her feet on the side of the pool, breaking it.

Taking it easy: Porn actress Janice Griffith tweeted this photo of herself resting at home after breaking her foot in a fall from a roof

On Friday, Ms Griffith spoke with TMZ via Skype, saying that she is upset that the accident had cost her several jobs, including a photo-shoot for the X-rated site Kink.com. She will likely remain sidelined for another two weeks.

She tweeted to her 45,000 followers: 'I just want to get back to work... that's my only concern. Anyone trying to book a gal with a broken foot?'

The 18-year-old entertainer declined to discuss the particulars of the ill-fated rooftop photo-shoot, but she did express regret over the entire ordeal. 

‘Looking back on it, it's not the best idea we've ever had,’ Griffith told TMZ. ‘It seems [sic] like a good idea at the time.’

Referring to her unfortunate fall, the petite young woman said she was surprised she didn’t make it into the pool since she only weighs about 90lbs.

The teenage porn star also insisted that there were no drugs or alcohol involved in the accident.

Griffith would not say if she has retained an attorney in preparation for a possible legal battle with Blizerian, only saying, ‘I’m still sorting everything out.’

Griffith added that what especially upsets her about the incident is that the hard-partying professional poker player, whom she met for the first time Wednesday on his roof, did not apologize to her.

'i did not ever hear sorry from him,' the teenager said.

The footage shared on LiveLeak shows Blizerian scooping up the naked teen, lifting her above his shoulder and throwing her from the roof to a pool below.

But she apparently grabbed on to his T-shirt at the last second and could be heard screaming as she fell into the water, Elite Daily noted.

'I broke my foot today,' she later wrote on Twitter.

On Thursday, she added: 'I was looking forward to shooting for @SexAndSub SO bad today, stupid broken foot.'

But Bilzerian refused to take the blame and retweeted a message that said: 'Dan Bilzerian was almost murdered by a naked female that tried to pull him off a rooftop hahaha good thing he's part hulk.'

Bilzerian is reportedly worth $100million, making the bulk of his cash as a high-stakes gambler after developing his skills as a student at the University of South Florida.

He has won multiple tournaments, his 
most successful being the 2009 World Series of Poker. He is also 
co-founder of online poker room, Victory Poker.

Before gambling, he served with the Navy before eventually getting kicked out of SEAL training two days before graduating for offending an officer. He was ultimately given an honorable discharge.

He lives extravagantly with homes in Las Vegas, San Diego and Los Angeles, and his Instagram photos show the hard partying between their walls.

Gun lover: Bilzerian also often posts pictures showing guns, including this one saying, 'I picked the #bosshog'

The images are packed with mounds of cash, 
guns, 
supercars with license plates reading ‘SUCK IT’ and girls - many of whom are mostly naked and fawning over him.

'Basically I didn't get a ton of attention as a kid, I guess that's why I’m such a flashy lunatic,' he previously told MailOnline. 'I'm like a big kid. But it's not like a called myself the Instagram King. I put up what people want to see and that just happened.'

However, his risky lifestyle has resulted in some serious repercussions, including a double heart attack and a pulmonary embolism.

And now he claims he has begun making plans for a different existence.

He has part financed several feature films including Lone Survivor with Mark Wahlberg, which tells the story of Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell and a failed mission in Afghanistan in 2005.

He has small roles in two other upcoming films – The Other Woman and The Equalizer –and is in the midst of developing a horror film. 

He has also been giving to charity as part of his attempt to rebrand from playboy to 'gentleman of poker'.

Among the donations, he has given $100,000 to Typhoon Haiyan victims and the $20,000 to a family who adopted four children with terrible birth defects only for one of them to develop leukemia.
