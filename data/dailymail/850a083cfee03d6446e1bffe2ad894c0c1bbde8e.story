A thousand transgender Bangladeshis have marched in their country's first ever Pride parade to mark a year since their official recognition as a third gender.

Dhaka's busy streets were brought to a standstill as the transgender women, known as hijras in Bangladesh, drew crowds with their dancing and singing.

The group, many wearing colourful saris, unfurled a huge Bangladeshi flag and carried banners, one of which read: 'The days of stigma, discrimination and fear are over'.

'I never dreamt that I would see this day in my life,' said Sonali, a 25-year-old hijra who uses one name.

'We are stigmatised everywhere. We are discriminated against. We are laughed at just because we do not feel like a man or woman. But today is different. We feel like we're normal human beings,' Sonali added.

Hijras have been a part of life in south Asia going back to antiquity. They are mentioned in the Kama Sutra and live in communities across Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.

Their communities have sustained themselves over generations by 'adopting' young boys who have run away from or been rejected by their families.

Hijras have long suffered discrimination, particularly during the era of the British Raj when authorities labelled them 'a breach of public decency' and tried to eradicate them.

But last November, in a landmark decision, the government of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina passed laws to recognise hijras as a third gender, allowing them to identify themselves as a separate gender in passports and other state papers.

The government says there are around 15,000 hijras in the country. But rights groups put the number of hijras in the country at around half a million.

Bangladesh has a population of around 156 million, according to recent official estimates.

On Sunday the community held a seminar to discuss their rights and staged a talent show to identify the best dancers and singers. A hijra beauty contest is due to be held later this month.

Leo Kenny, country director for UNAIDS, said more should be done to uphold their rights.

'Stigma and discrimination for the hijras mean this population does not have access to social services and other human rights. Ensuring the rights for hijras is important,' he said.

The transgender pride march reflects a growing tolerance for the rights of sexual minorities in Hasina's secular government.

Early this year the country's first magazine for lesbian, gays, bisexual and transgender people was launched with hardly any protests.
