There could still be a place for Sir Bradley Wiggins at Team Sky despite saying his Grand Tour days are behind him, insists Sir Dave Brailsford.

The Team Sky chief was responding to the rider’s claim that road cycling is cut-throat, whereas the track ‘feels more like a family and a closer-knit group of people.’

He said: ‘We’re talking to Bradley and his management team and ideally we’d like to find a solution to support him through to Rio (the 2016 Olympic Games).

Compromise: Team Sky's Brailsford wants to 'get behind him and support him' to Rio

‘I don’t think it would be a straightforward road contract.

‘I think it’d be more creative in terms of what would help him get to where he needs to be for Rio.

‘We’d certainly like to get behind him and support him.’

Before the 2012 Olympics, Team Sky supported three riders — Geraint Thomas, Peter Kennaugh and Ben Swift — whose main goal was the team pursuit. Brailsford was performance director of British Cycling, a position he left this year, but he said he would still be willing to support Wiggins’ track ambition.

It would be on a drastically reduced salary, though. Wiggins is paid around £3million a year by Sky, a deal agreed after he won the 2012 Tour de France and which ends in December.

Whether or not he stays could depend on whether he is willing to stay for a fraction of that. ‘I think he’s made it quite clear himself he’d like to finish his career in Rio,’ added Brailsford. ‘If you want to get there at the level required, they saw (in Glasgow) that they’ve got some good foundations but they’ve got work to do as well.’

Brailsford didn’t rule out a return to the Tour de France by Wiggins, saying: ‘Physically he has another Tour in him, I’m sure, but it’s hard work to get ready for a Grand Tour. It’s very much down to Brad.’
