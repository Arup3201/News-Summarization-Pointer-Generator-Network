Tony Abbott has announced that a terror attack on Australia is 'likely' after revealing there had been a heightened level of 'terrorist chatter' in the aftermath of the Sydney siege.

The Prime Minister said the national security committee of cabinet's meeting on Tuesday received intelligence from ASIO and the Australian Federal Police Commissioner of the increased 'chatter' amongst terrorist sympathisers, the ABC reports.

'The briefing from the security agencies today indicated there has been a heightened level of terrorist chatter in the aftermath of the Martin Place siege,' he said.

'That's why it's important that people remain alert and aware as well as reassured that our police and security agencies are doing everything they humanly can to keep us safe.'

The terror threat level hasn't been lifted, and remains at high.

'At this level an attack is likely,' Mr Abbott said.

'We don't know when and how an attack may come, but we do know there are people with the intent and capability to carry out further attacks.'
