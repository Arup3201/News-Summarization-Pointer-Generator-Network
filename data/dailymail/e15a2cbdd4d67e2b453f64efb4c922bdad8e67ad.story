This year's mass emergence of mayflies in the Mississippi Valley was one for the record books.

The annual swarm rose above La Crosse, Wisconsin from the river on Sunday evening in a dark cloud so dense it caused a three-car roadway collision, blacked out the sun and even lit up area weather radar.

The nuisance occurrence always causes headaches but experts say this year's swarm was bigger than normal, though like every year the insects die off just as quickly as they emerge.

Living blanket: This year's mayfly emergence in the Mississippi Valley focused near La Crosse, Wisconsin was bigger than usual -- but as always became a stomach-turning nuisance

Atmospheric anomaly: The swarm was so thick and dense it appeared much like a rain storm on weather radar

And according to experts, the sizable swarm is a positive sign for water quality and after the many millions of bugs mate and die off within a day or two they'll become a long-awaited feast for famished fish.

While millions of protein and fat-filled bugs dying off is great news for fish--and, later, fishermen--the news is not so good for drivers.

In addition to the swarm briefly darkening out the sun this year, the less fortunate mayflies that find themselves smashed on the road become a thick, oily sludge that can and does lead to car accidents.

The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports that a Wisconsin road became so slick from the mayflies Sunday evening it caused at least one of the drivers involved in a three-car crash to lose control of her vehicle. They also noted the limited visibility at the time of the crash.

Two people were injured in the crash, but only one person was taken to a local hospital.

The problem has been so serious in the past that authorities have had to dump sand onto roadways and bridges to improve traction, much like salt and sand are used in the snowy months.

One of the most striking things about this year's Mississippi emergence was its marked radar echo.

Like a freak rainstorm in reverse, the emergence began to show up as a raucous blue and green around La Crosse at about 8:45 on Sunday.

The mayflies quickly moved along with a northerly wind up the Mississippi and appeared on radar screens just as a light-moderate rainfall might, according to NOAA.

Over the course of around three hours, the radar faded as the mayflies spread out. By midnight, they were all but gone.

And by no later than Tuesday, they were all dead, having mating and laying eggs to ensure next year's hatch.

 behind, of course, are their millions of gossamer bodies, piled in 
heaps along the riverbank, in parking lots and on porches and all over 
businesses and homes.

Dangerous? This year's emergence of the little bugs took place Sunday evening and quickly enveloped the Mississippi River town, even causing car accidents

Gross: The nuisance bugs cover just about everything once they emerge and nearby residents are warned to cover their mouths and noses

Slick conditions: A car accident involving three vehicles was reported this year after the protein and fat-rich bugs created a greasy mush on the road. No serious injuries were reported, however

Authorities are sometimes forced to use sand on the roads, much as they do during the snowy months, to prevent accidents caused by the greasy bug slicks

Messy: The bugs are a blessing for hungry wildlife but a curse for home and business owners who have to deal with the aftermath

The mayfly (Ephemera) looks innocent enough...when there's just one

While the bugs are large and can be a nuisance, people are urged not to kill them because they omit an unpleasant fishy odor when squashed.

Mayflies are an important source of nutrition for many species, including a wide variety of fish and birds. 

They’re an annoyance because they stick to clothes and sometimes land in hair.

However, they do not bite humans.

The mayfly population goes through cycles, said Don Schloesser, a researcher at the Great Lakes Science Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Some years they come earlier than others. This year along the Mississippi the emergence came later than usual, possibly due to earlier flooding.

Mayflies typically live for a day or two before dying. But the life cycle actually lasts two years.

Mayflies begin as eggs on the water’s surface before the eggs sink to the bottom of the lake. The larvae hatch and burrow into the mud. Later, they wriggle out of their burrows and take off from the water.

Die-off: The bugs die off and pile up in clumps after just a day or so, creating heaps of insect carcasses to clean up

It's a good thing? The mayflies are annoying but indicate a healthy waterway. They also make the environment even more vibrant by feeding hungry fish

The mayflies were concentrated near La Crosse, Wisconsin, often a focal point for annual swarms

@highlight

Their crushed bodies make roadways greasy - this year's Mississippi caused at least one car accident

@highlight

Two people were injured in the crash and one was taken to the hospital

The species, hexagenia bilineata, is a positive sign for water quality within the Mississippi Valley and a feast for sport fish

Just as quickly as they emerge, the bugs die off in about a day after mating
