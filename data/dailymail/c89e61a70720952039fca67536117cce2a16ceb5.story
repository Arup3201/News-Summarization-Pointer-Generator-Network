Diego Costa believes top sides cannot leave the smallest stone unturned in football nowadays if they are to win matches.

The Chelsea striker has started his career at Stamford Bridge with a bang scoring nine goals in as many appearances since his £32million switch from Atletico Madrid in the summer.

Costa's form has been mirrored by the Blues' start to the season that sees them leading the Premier League by four points after nine games.

The Stamford Bridge outfit also sit top of Group G in the UEFA Champions League and Costa has pinpointed their success to the level of detail the squad are prepared for before matches.

'Top teams nowadays are pretty much on a level playing field and you need to be super careful about every tiny detail of the contest because any single one of them could make the difference.' he told the latest Champions League Magazine.

'Chelsea is packed full of skilful players and if those of us up front become the first line of defence and help protect the rest of the team, then we are doing an important job,' he added.

'Since I was a kid I've always had a fierce hunger for victory inside me. I've always hated losing.

'Defeat can be useful for you if - and only if - you draw important lessons from it. My hunger to win is one of my fundamental assets. If one day I lose that desire then I'll not be useful any more.'

The 26-year-old enjoyed a stellar campaign at Atletico last season helping the club lift their first La Liga title in 18 years.

Costa played an integral part in Diego Simeone's side scoring 35 goals in all competitions last season as the club  also finished runners-up in the Champions League to bitter rivals Real Madrid.

Despite this though, Costa is happy with his decision to move to Chelsea this summer - revealing that playing in the Premier League was something he had always wanted to try.

'I was extremely happy at Atletico and the last year when we achieved so much was the best year of my career as a footballer.

'However, you always try to improve your life. The opportunity to join this tremendously important club came and while Atleti is a great team, this was a different league, one I'd always wanted to try.

'People always used to say that my game would fit the Premier League perfectly and so the opportunity to sign for an extremely famous club like Chelsea made me super-excited.

'I have to keep on working hard. I still have many years ahead of me in my career so I hope I will be able to play in another Champions League final - to have another opportunity to win this competition.'
