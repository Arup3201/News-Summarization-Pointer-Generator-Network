The Maryland Attorney General has been pictured at an underage party where his son and his friends are drinking and dancing shirtless on tables.

Doug Gansler, the state's top lawyer and a current gubernatorial candidate, is in hot water over the picture since he has been an outspoken activist against underage drinking.

His son Sam and a large group of friends were celebrating their high school graduation at a week-long beach house party in nearby Delaware.

Caught in the act: Attorney General Doug Gansler is seen taking a picture with his phone in the middle of a party where recent high school graduates are seen holding SOLO cups

Not only was he present at the party but Mr Gansler was one of the parents who chipped in and paid to rent the beach house for the graduating seniors.

In the middle: Gansler faces backlash over the photo because he has been outspoken against underage drinking

The Baltimore Sun obtained a list of rules that the parents gave to the partying teens, saying that there would be no coupling up in the bedrooms and no drinking hard alcohol.

'Assume for purposes of discussion that there was widespread drinking at this party- how is that relevant to me?' he said to The Baltimore Sun.

He went on to use the fact that the party- which revelers dubbed 'eviction party' 
because of the intensity of the partying- took place in Delaware rather 
than their home state of Maryland.

'The question is, do I have any moral authority over other people's children at beach week in another state? I say no.'

One of the most incriminating photos was found on Instagram, showing the 50-year-old Gansler in the middle of a crowded room of dancing teens, holding up his cell phone as if to take a picture of two bare-chest boys dancing on either side of a teenage girl in a bikini.

At a press conference held after the photo became public, Gansler continued to toe the line that he did not know if any illegal drinking was taking place.

'In this case, maybe I should have done something different,' he said according to The Washington Post.

'If I had seen anything that was dangerous or risky... I would have done something about it.'

He put up another defense as well, saying that while he did see plenty of teens drinking out of the distinctive red Solo cups- generally associated with beer pong- there was no way of knowing was was inside each cup.

'It could be Kool-Aid instead of beer,' Gansler said on Thursday.

He went on to say that it was not his job to stop other people's children from drinking under the state age of 21.

'My responsibility is only to my child,' he said in an interview with The Sun on Tuesday.

'Everybody has their own moral compass. Mine is to raise my own child." He said firmly that his son was not drinking.'

The issue is particularly poignant for Gansler as he has appeared in public service announcements calling to end underage drinking.

'Parents you're the leading influence on your teens decision not to drink. Itâ€™s never too early to talk with your kids about smart ways to say no,' he says to the camera in one of the videos.
