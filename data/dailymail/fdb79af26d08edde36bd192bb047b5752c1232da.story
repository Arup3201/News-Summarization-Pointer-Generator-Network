'We showed we can create a lot of chances. It's not easy in the Champions League. They have great players. This is the game. We need a bit of luck. Let's see how the coach wants us to play in the second leg.'

The Sweden international went on to warn his team-mates that they will have to be at their best if they are to find a way past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

He added: 'The goalkeeper did a very good job, don't take that away from him.

'He's a world-class goalkeeper and he showed it. Let's see how we do in the second game to get the ball past him.'

PSG manager Laurent Blanc and Chelsea goalscorer Ivanovic also heaped praise on Courtois, by stating: ‘What amazes me about Courtois is that despite his height, he’s very quick. I watched the headers from Ibrahimovic again and he makes such quick saves. Chelsea have one of the greats there.’

Ivanovic added: ‘Thibaut was amazing. It’s a great feeling to have someone behind you who is doing something.'

Ibrahimovic, who came close to scoring in the final stages of the last 16 first leg clash, penned the words '805 million names' on to his boots ahead of the match to show his support for the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).
