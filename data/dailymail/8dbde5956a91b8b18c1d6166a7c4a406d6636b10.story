A breakfast truck today highlighted food waste by handing out free smoothies and juices made from fruit which would otherwise have been thrown away.

Leftover ingredients such as oranges, apples, coconut milk and natural yoghurt were mixed together to form four recipes.

Smoothies such as the ‘Use me up, Honey’ and juices such as ‘Luscious Leftovers’ were served up for the first time in London today.

They are being given out as part of the Waste & Resources Action Programme’s Love Food Hate Waste campaign highlighting wastage across the nation.

It follows government figures this week that one million tonnes of food and drink are tossed away each year - costing the UK more than £2.4bn.

And almost half of this wastage comes from whole or unopened fresh vegetables and salads, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs funded report.

In London alone, more than half a million tonnes of food and drink are thrown away annually - costing Londoners over £1bn.

That alone amounts to a staggering £40m cost to London boroughs in reprocessing and disposing of the waste.

But customers can now get a taste of leftover foods when they try a fruity smoothie or juice from the ‘Liquid Greens Machine’ truck.

Emma Marsh, head of the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, said: 'The Liquid Greens Machine is just one example of a creative way for people to experiment with good food and drink.

'They should try making something delicious and different and, by doing just one thing differently, we can all help tackle the issue of food waste.'

All the food and drink sourced for the recipes comes from FoodCycle - a national food bank charity.

The ‘Use me up, Honey’ smoothies contains oranges, honey, kiwi, banana and crushed ice.

Meanwhile, customers can also try the ‘Tropical Tasted (Not Wasted)’ withpineapple, mango, banana, peach and coconut milk.

Also on offer are the ‘Do One Thing Differently Dessert’ with apple, natural yoghurt, blueberry, blackberry and raspberry and or the ‘Luscious Leftovers’ juice with pineapple, apple, broccoli, spinach, celery, ginger and cucumber.

The campaign believes the British public can each save £200 a year by using up food we consider as waste.

The Liquid Green Machine’s tour begins in London and will visit cities including Manchester and Cardiff before ending in Glasgow on September 5.
