Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Neymar stepped up to the plate and answered the calls of the Brazilian nation to help them ease through to the last 16.

After being stifled by Mexico last time out, the number 10 was back to his best as Brazil ensured they qualified as Group A winners with a 4-1 win against Cameroon to set up a showdown with Chile.

Neymar - who scored the 100th goal of this summer's World Cup - tormented the Africans all evening and his double moved him clear at the top of the scoring charts.

However, Brazil will be hoping a knee injury picked up by their star man midway through the second half doesn't prove to be serious.

The warning signs were there as early as the third minute when Neymar burst into the box and cut the ball back for Paulinho, who could only fire his shot straight at a defender.

The 22-year-old whizzkid was shoved to the floor by Allan Nyom, with the Cameroon man somehow escaping without a booking.

However, Neymar gained revenge 60 seconds later when he slotted Brazil ahead from 12 yards - his third goal in as many matches.

He was denied a second shortly afterwards when his thumping volley stung the hands of Charles Itandje.

Joel Matip's tap in hauled Cameroon 
level, but Neymar's superb individual effort restored Brazil's advantage
 10 minutes before the break.

The Barcelona ace picked the ball up inside the Cameroon half, waltzed past Nicolas N'Koulou like he wasn't even there and wrong-footed Itandje from 16 yards.

Neymar was denied a hat-trick early into the second half when a full-stretch Itandje clawed away his free-kick.

However, Brazil's main man suffered an injury scare when he appeared to jar his knee after a collision with Matip.

Luiz Felipe Scolari was clearly taking no chances and decided to take Neymar off as a precaution 20 minutes from time.
