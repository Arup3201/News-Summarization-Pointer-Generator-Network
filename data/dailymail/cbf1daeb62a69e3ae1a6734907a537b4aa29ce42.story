A bride who spent her wedding night in a cell next door to her new husband has admitted she racially abused and assaulted a hotel doorman after her credit card was declined.

Kirsty Bigland, 30, was still in her white wedding dress when she called the Asian security guard a 'p*** b******'  before spitting in his face and punching and kicking him.

The attack happened at the £300-a-night Hilton Hotel, on Deansgate, Manchester, on May 31 when Bigland and her husband Nicholas, 25, were due to spend their wedding night.

But when they tried to check in after their reception they were told that their credit card had been refused and sparked a vicious row  between the couple and members of staff.

Police arrived at the  hotel - a favourite of the city's Premier League footballers, musicians and other stars - and arrested both bride and groom to a nearby police station where they spent the night in neighbouring cells.

Manchester Magistrates' Court heard staff had tried to usher them out of the Hilton but Ms Bigland  began running at them swearing and spitting.

During attempts to restrain her, she shouted 'get off me you black p*** b******' then attempted to punch one member of staff and spat on his shirt and jacket before yelled: 'F***  you - you should not be in this country'.

She then spat in the guard's his face, punched him in the chest and kicked him once. 

Guilt: Mother-of-four Bigland was due to to stand trial today but changed her plea to a charge of racially aggravated assault to guilty. Her husband admitted a public order offence in September

Assault: Mrs Bigland was still in her wedding dress when she spat at and punched and kicked the security guard at the Deansgate Hilton in Manchester, before she called him a 'p*** b******'

Her new husband stood in the way of a hotel barrier so cars could not leave and eventually had to be pinned down by security staff after he shouted: 'come on you k***heads - I will knock you out.' 

After they were detained they spent their first night of marriage in separate police cells.

Mother-of-four Bigland was due to to stand trial today but changed her plea to a charge of racially aggravated assault to guilty.

One charge of harassment and one public order charge were withdrawn by Sabrina Sohota, prosecuting.

Bigland's husband admitted a public order offence when he appeared before magistrates in September.

Prosecutor Miss Ruth Mann said: ‘A member of reception staff was dealing with the couple. At first he could not locate the booking and when he did find it the credit card was then denied. Payment was required before the room could be allocated.

‘‘The receptionist then heard Nicholas refer to another member of staff as a “f***ing idiot”. The defendant was using his mobile phone at the time and swearing to who he was talking to.

Punishment: The couple, of Salford, are due to be sentenced on December 9 and were bailed on condition they do not contact witnesses or go near the hotel

‘Kirsty was heard saying “f***ing monkeys” then “f***ing P***s”. He took this remark as a reference to the ethnicity of himself and colleagues and the couple were not allowed to remain in the hotel due to their behaviour.’

She added: ‘Kirsty ran at the staff swearing and spitting at them. Nicholas then made comments that he would assault them if they touched his wife. He was pinned down and stopped from hitting anyone. Kirsty ran towards the staff. They stopped her and she said “get off me your P*** b******”. She attempted to punch him and spat on his shirt and jacket.

‘The defendant clearly most responsible here is Kirsty Bigland.’

The couple, of Salford, are due to be sentenced on December 9 and were bailed on condition they do not contact witnesses or go near the hotel.
