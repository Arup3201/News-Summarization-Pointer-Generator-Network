The former New York University professor accused of stalking and harassing her ex-lover, chief Citigroup economist Willem Buiter, appeared in court on Thursday morning.

Heleen Mees, 44, a Dutch economist and educator, was arrested in July 2013 and accused of sending him more than 3,000 sexually explicit and threatening emails and Facebook messages.

Buiter, a 63-year-old married father of two, was admonished by a judge in August 2013 for contacting his alleged stalker by LinkedIn and Skype in the month after she was arrested.

But Mees attended a hearing in New York today where her request for dismissal was denied and her case will now proceed to trial.

Mees's attorneys are arguing that her communication with Buiter was just an ordinary part of their relationship.

In August 2013 Buiter was ‘admonished' by Judge Joanne Quinones because he sent an ‘invitation to connect’ to Mees via business networking website LinkedIn.

He had also contacted her on Skype just weeks before she was charged with allegedly sending him thousands of messages.

The full extent of Mees’ alleged stalking was revealed in court papers which showed she followed him to China and Amsterdam, where she used a fake name to try and get into his hotel.

She also sent Buiter, the chief economist at Citigroup, a message which read: ‘I hope you die (read this to your wife)’.

Prosecutors say that her obsessive behavior lasted between 2009 and July 2013. Some of the emails were sexual, such as a request to 'also send him naked pictures of other women'.

But others were more disturbing such as a picture of some dead birds next to which she wrote: 'I hope your plane falls out the sky.'

In the criminal complaint against her Buiter said: ‘In May 2010, the defendant tried to meet with me at my hotel in Beijing, China, and in January 2013, the defendant tried to meet me at my hotel in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, by using a fake name.

‘On May 6, 2013, the defendant came to my apartment building in the County and State of New York, and tried to be let up to my apartment.’

In August 2013, Mees’ lawyer Ira London told a court that the reality was in fact very different.

He said that the affair was ‘encouraged on social media and in person' as well by Cambridge-educated Mr Buiter, who was born in Holland but has British citizenship.

Buiter sent Mees a cease and desist letter on February 27 but Mr London said that on June 19 he contacted his client on Skype.

Threatened: Mees allegedly sent harassing messages' to Buiter's wife, economics professor Anne Sibert (pictured), and the couple's two children

Buiter disconnected his alleged stalker as a contact on Skype on June 23 but three days later he reconnected her.

Mr
 London told the court that this behavior ‘only served to illustrate 
that this was a bilateral relationship and not harassment'.

Mees
 was arrested on July 1 when the first criminal complaint was filed.

Among the allegations was that she harassed Mr Buiter's children from 
his first marriage, David, 22, and Elizabeth, 19.

An
 amended complaint was sent on August 5 removing the allegation that Mr 
Buiter's children were harassed.

The message to Mees from Mr Buiter via 
LinkedIn was sent two days later.

It is not clear if he sent it or the message was automated but Judge Quinones made it clear that regardless she was unimpressed.

Judge
 Quinones told the prosecutor: 'The People will admonish the complainant
 witness (Mr Buiter) that he is not to contact this defendant in any 
way'.

During a testy 
exchange she raised her voice to Mees to ask that she understood she was
 to have 'absolutely no contact' with Mr Buiter and his wife under the 
terms of a protection order.

She demurely replied: 'Yes'.

Willem Buiter has chaired the World 
Economic Forum and was on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy 
Committee. In 2010, he was hired as Citigroup's chief economist.

Over
 the past three decades, Buiter had taught economics at some of the 
world's most prestigious institutions, including Princeton, Yale and 
Cambridge universities.

Buiter, a native of the Netherlands, is 
married to economics professor Anne Sibert, and the couple have a 
22-year-old son and a 19-year-old daughter

Among
 the other allegations against Mees is that she targeted Sibert, a 
professor at the University of London’s Birkbeck college.

Buiter
 said in the criminal complaint: ‘The defendant's actions have caused me
 severe annoyance and alarm, and to fear for my physical safety and for 
the safety of my wife and my children.’

Mees, who is fluent in five languages, including Mandarin and French, was assistant professor in economics at Tilburg University and a researcher at the Erasmus School of Economics in the Netherlands. Her area of expertise is monetary policy and emerging economies.

It is believed that the brilliant economist and vocal advocate for the advancement of women in the workplace has become obsessed with her distinguished lover.

Mees even dedicated her PhD dissertation to Buiter and thanked him for being 'so kind' to meet with her in the summer of 2008 in London, according to the New York Post.
