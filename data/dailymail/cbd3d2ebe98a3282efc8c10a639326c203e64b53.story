Two children who vanished from a street in Birmingham this afternoon sparking a major police search have been found safe and well.

Officers launched a major operation to find Saina Sava, 11 and her four-year-old brother Adi who went missing from the Washwood Heath area at around midday today.

But the siblings were found this evening on a bus in the Erdington area of the city when they were spotted by a bus driver around 8.10pm.

It is believed that the young boy was in a four-wheeled pushchair, pushed by his sister when they disappeared.

Concern grew for their safety as officers showed photos of the children to passers-by in Washwood Heath in an effort to trace them.

As darkness fell, West Midlands Police confirmed that they had drafted in additional resources to help to try and find the children.

They also used Twitter and Facebook to spread the word about the pair, originally from Romania, who had only been living in Birmingham for three months.
