Hotel chain Marriott International has announced that it will no longer block guests' personal Wi-Fi devices after it received a flood of complaints and was fined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

‘Marriott International listens to its customers, and we will not block guests from using their personal Wi-Fi devices at any of our managed hotels,’ the company said in a statement posted on its website on Wednesday.

In October the FCC fined the Marriott Gaylord Opryland hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, $600,000 for cutting off conventioneers from using their own Wi-Fi, rather than buying the service from the hotel for between $250 and $1,000 per stand.

Marriott had claimed the devices interfered with wireless networks provided on-site and created a potential security risk.

‘The question at hand is what measures a network operator can take to detect and contain rogue and imposter Wi-Fi hotspots used in our meeting and conference spaces that pose a security threat,’ Marriott said earlier this month.

The hotel noted it wasn't blocking the devices in guest rooms or lobbies.

Tech staff at the Marriott used a monitoring system to de-authenticate guests' personal Wi-Fi hot spots, but the FCC called their actions a violation of federal communications law.

Marriott had previously argued that conventions where attendees use their own Wi-Fi hotspots can cause interference with their own network and even a potential security risk

In October the FCC fined the Marriott Gaylord Opryland hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, $600,000 for cutting off conventioneers from using their own Wi-Fi.

It used scanners to spot networks, telling people to buy the service from the hotel for between $250 and $1,000 per stand.

The FCC had been considering a petition from Marriott to be allowed to continue blocking Wi-Fi devices in its hotels.

Hilton Worldwide and the American Hospitality and Lodging Association, the hotel industry’s lobbying group, had also supported the Marriott’s petition.

Technology giants including Google had called Marriott’s the blocking was 'inconsistent with the goals of promoting competition.'

‘We will continue to look to the FCC to clarify appropriate security measures network operators can take to protect customer data, and will continue to work with the industry and others to find appropriate market solutions that do not involve the blocking of Wi-Fi devices,’ Marriott said in its statement on Thursday.
