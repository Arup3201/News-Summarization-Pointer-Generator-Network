North Korea has a notoriously sullied human rights record but following the Ferguson protests earlier this week they described the United States as 'a tundra of human rights.'

A foreign ministry spokesperson cited the Ferguson protests, in which a police officer was not charged for shooting an unarmed black teenager, and said it is evidence of racist America.

'This is clear proof of the real picture of the US as a tundra of human rights, where extreme racial discrimination acts are openly practiced,' said the spokesman to North's official KCNA news agency.

Condemning America: North Korea, lead by controversial figure Kim Jong-Un, has called the United States a 'tundra of human rights' following the racially charged Ferguson protests 

This statement comes just one week after the UN pushed the Security Council to take North Korea and leaders like Kim Jong-Un to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for an indictment on crimes against humanity.

The resolution is drafted by both Japan and the European Union and states that North Korea's human rights abuses are 'without parallel in the contemporary world.'

Pyongyang has struck back at the resolution and said they were controlled by the US to humiliate leader Kim Jong-Un

'The great irony is that the US tries to measure other countries with its wrong human rights standard, though it is a typical human rights abuser,' the foreign ministry spokesman said.

Yahoo reports that earlier this week as Kim Jong-Un toured a museum dedicated to alleged bloodbaths by US forces during the Korean War and said Americans were like 'cannibals seeking pleasure in slaughter.'

The Guardian reports that also this week Russia also condemned the United States during the Ferguson protests and said, ‘the problem of racism in the US has a systemic nature and has the potential to cause serious unrest and splits in society.'
