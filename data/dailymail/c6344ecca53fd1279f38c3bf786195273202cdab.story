Pope Francis has given Christmas packages to 2,000 immigrants at a shelter near the Vatican.

The package included a Christmas card signed by the Pope, postage stamps, a pre-paid international calling card, and a free day travel card for the Rome metro.

Handed out at the Dono di Maria shelter the care package was designed to help the recipients reconnect with their families during the festive period.

The presents were distributed by Papal almoner Archbishop Konrad Krajewski and sisters at the shelter.

'The guests were very happy'” said Sister Michelle, the superior of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity in Rome.

She added that Benedict XVI had also reached out to those in need through various initiatives, in ways that were never publicized by the Holy See’s Press Office, reported the Catholic News Agency.

Meanwhile Pope Francis has made an amateur video praising the world's 'cartoneros' - the poor people who pick through garbage to find recyclable and reusable goods. 

He says their work is dignified and good for the environment.

Francis recorded the video Dec. 5 while 
meeting with members of the Excluded Workers' Movement of his native 
Argentina, which released the video this week at an annual meeting of 
trash recyclers.

Francis, known for his simple habits, has denounced today's 'throw-away culture' and said in the video that food that is tossed aside each day could feed all the world's hungry.

Francis has a long relationship with Argentina's 'cartoneros' - literally 'cardboard people.'

He would celebrate Mass for them as archbishop and invited them on stage during World Youth Day in July.
