Luis Suarez will have missed a staggering 39 matches because of biting opponents by the time he serves his latest ban.

The Uruguay striker was suspended by FIFA on Thursday for nine international matches and four months from all football activity following his bite on Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini.

It is the third time Suarez has been hit with a lengthy ban for such an offence.

Home time? Suarez boards the team bus ahead of training on Thursday, hours later he was banned for four months and nine Uruguay matches for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini

Stage 3: Suarez appears to clamp his jaws down and bite Chiellini's shoulder

It was during his time at Ajax in 2010 that he was suspended for seven matches for a bite on PSV’s Otman Bakkal.

Then,
 at Liverpool in April, 2013, Suarez sunk his teeth into Chelsea 
defender Branislav Ivanovic and was subsequently banned for 10 matches.

His 
latest indiscretion during Uruguay’s 1-0 victory over Italy on Monday 
- which qualified the South Americans for the last 16 of the World Cup - looks set to cost him 22 matches of competitive football and immediately rules him out of the finals in Brazil.

Those matches will 
include Liverpool’s opening nine fixtures of the Premier League season, 
as well as three rounds of Champions League group games and the third 
round of the League Cup, totalling 13 for the Reds.

The first Premier
 League match Suarez will be available for – should he remain at 
Liverpool – is their trip to Newcastle on November 1.
