Leaving his £2.5million home with a wry smile yesterday, Andrew Mitchell didn’t look like a man facing financial ruin after losing his Plebgate libel trial.

But that may be because the 58-year-old millionaire politician has calculated he can pay off his hefty £2million legal bill in a matter of months. Mr Mitchell’s political career was thought to be in tatters after a High Court judge ruling that he did call police officers ‘f***ing plebs’ in a foul-mouthed confrontation in Downing Street two years ago.

But the former Cabinet Minister last night confirmed he planned to stand again as MP for Sutton Coldfield at the election.

Mr Mitchell reportedly believes he can ‘wipe the slate clean’ by standing again and winning. He had a majority of 17,000 at the last election and is thought to believe he can restart his political career in a ‘new ball game’.

And he can draw comfort from the fact that business is booming in his private-sector work as a consultant to firms offering services such as offshore banking to the super rich. Since last November, the former investment banker has made more than £150,000 for just 28 days’ work, dwarfing the ‘basic’ £67,060 MP’s salary.

He commands as much as £18,000 a day, which would be enough to pay off the legal bill in four months if he managed to sustain the top rate.

Details of the ex-Chief Whip’s lucrative sideline emerged yesterday as the row over Plebgate continued.

A veteran officer who was on duty at the time said it was a ‘nonsense incident’ which needn’t have ended up in court if Scotland Yard had simply drawn a line under it.

Ian Richardson, who recently retired after 30 years in the Metropolitan Police, criticised the force’s handling of the row, saying no one – including Mr Mitchell – should have lost their job over the 63-second exchange at the Downing Street gates.

The constable, who heard part of the conversation in September 2012 when Mr Mitchell exploded with anger at officers who refused to open the gate for him to cycle through, said: ‘Mr Mitchell lost his sense of humour. Who hasn’t lost their sense of humour at work?

‘It was all totally unnecessary.’

He told the BBC that he wrote to his superiors, setting out what had happened, in the hope that the Met could put the matter ‘into some kind of reasonable perspective to draw a line under it there’.

But he said: ‘They were very interested in the leak and to find out where the leak was, but I was told that who said what to whom at the gate was of no interest. It could have been said that it is a minor incident that has been leaked to the newspapers and let’s all move on. But of course we didn’t move on and we ended up all at the High Court.’

He accused the Police Federation of ‘jumping on the bandwagon’ and criticised Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe’s handling of the affair, saying: ‘I think he could have done more at the time.’

Yesterday David Cameron said it was ‘never right to be abusive or rude’ to a police officer, and added: ‘The judge has made very clear his verdict and I think everyone should accept that verdict and move on.’ On Thursday a High Court judge castigated the ‘childish’ MP, ruling that he did shout at PC Toby Rowland: ‘You don’t run this f****** government. You’re f****** plebs.’

The devastating ruling came at the end of a complex libel trial after Mr Mitchell sued News Group Newspapers, publishers of The Sun, over the allegation, and Mr Rowland countersued the MP.

Mr Mitchell was ordered to pay costs of £300,000 by January 3 and may face a total bill of £2million as he will have to pay the other side’s legal fees and damages to Mr Rowland.

His law firm Atkins Thomson also faces an estimated £1million bill after failing to get documents relating to their budget into the court in time, meaning it had to represent Mr Mitchell on a ‘no win, no fee basis’.

But Parliamentary records published this week indicate Mr Mitchell may be able to afford the costs.

On May 16 this year, he was paid £18,000 for one day’s work with Investec, a specialist private banking group. The politician has several homes in Britain and Europe. He lives in a £2.5million house in Islington, North London, with his wife Sharon, a doctor. Yesterday the couple left their home without commenting.
