Brendan Rodgers lavished praise on Raheem Sterling - and his new haircut - on Wednesday night as the forward fired Liverpool to within touching distance of Wembley.

Sporting a shaven head, the England international - playing in an unfamiliar centre-forward role - scored twice as the Reds set up a mouthwatering Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea with victory over Bournemouth.

And Sterling’s manager waxed lyrical about his influential starlet, who is in talks over a new five-year deal worth £70,000 per week, after he scored his first goals since September.

‘Will he be keeping his lucky haircut? I hope so. He looked about 12, he looks so young, he’s just turned 20,’ said Rodgers.

‘I thought he was outstanding. He’s a kid that, for some reason, seems to be getting a lot of stick.

‘His contract situation is nothing to do with him. His representatives are the ones working with the club.

‘You can see he’s happy and enjoying his football. He was unfortunate not to score at Old Trafford on Sunday but he was a real threat.

‘He plays like Alexis Sanchez’s role for Arsenal, not an out-and-out striker but his speed and movement causes problems.

‘His ability to turn and drop in, his threat on the counter attack. He’s been the real catalyst for us this season.’

He added: ‘I was hopeful after losing at Old Trafford on Sunday, even though the result wasn’t ideal.

‘I saw moments in our game which were good, creating a lot of chances. We know we have a long way to go, but the signs were there.

‘This was a tough game against a team top of their league, so for us to dominate as we did was very pleasing.

‘Slowly, we’re getting there. The players are adapting. I’m looking to find ways to be more creative, because we’ve not been that this season.

‘But tonight it was more like we’ve produced last season.’

Commenting on the semi-final draw, Rodgers, who confirmed Dejan Lovren picked up a groin injury, added: ‘Our objective tonight was to get through.

‘We knew which ever team we got would be a difficult game. If you’re going to win the competition, which is our objective, you have to beat the best team.

‘It’s over two legs and we’ll relish that opportunity.’

Meanwhile, Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe admitted his disappointment at the phantom whistle that played a crucial role in Lazar Markovic’s goal.

Tommy Elphick, convinced he’d heard referee Mark Clattenburg’s whistle, stopped in the lead up to Liverpool’s second, which eventually led to the Serbian doubling Liverpool’s lead.

However, the whistle came from a section of Bournemouth fans as Liverpool made Elphick pay for his presumption.

‘I’m aware Tommy stopped because he thought the referee had blown,’ said Howe.

‘I heard the whistle myself from the stand, our supporters. Tommy thought it was the referee.

‘There you go; I’m sure the person who’s done it wouldn’t have meant to have cost us a goal.

‘I’ve never seen anything like that before. You believe the referee has blown the whistle, sometimes you get a booking for carrying on.’
