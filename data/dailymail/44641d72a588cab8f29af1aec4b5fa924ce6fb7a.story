Three people were rescued Saturday after a small plane went down near Beluga Mountain just northwest of Anchorage, Alaska.

The plane's emergency locator beacon sent a signal to the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center at about 1:30pm on Saturday.

The Alaska Air National Guard's rescue helicopter headed for the coordinates transmitted from the beacon and found the plane 1.2 miles away.
