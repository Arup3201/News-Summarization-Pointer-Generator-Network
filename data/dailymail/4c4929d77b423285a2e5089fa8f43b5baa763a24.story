It says a lot about how miserable a World Cup semi-final was contested in Sao Paulo that even the penalty shootout was somehow dull. The one moment of sparkling genius in an otherwise turgid match featuring Argentina and Holland was a tackle by Javier Mascherano.

What a tackle it was. With the game seemingly destined for extra-time, Holland’s star of this World Cup, Arjen Robben, made a last-gasp bid to snatch a spot in Sunday’s final with just seconds left on the clock. Robben burst on to a cute flick from Wesley Sneijder, took two touches at full pace to bear down on Sergio Romero’s goal and unleashed the shot that would break Argentine hearts.

But somehow there was Mascherano. His diving boot was dangled in hope and despair but arrived with timing so perfect it could make a Swiss watchmaker blush. Danger averted, match saved. Thirty minutes of stupefying extra-time and that anti-climax of a penalty shootout later, and Argentina were heading for their date with destiny.

Holland and Argentina are famed for producing players of rarefied skill and exquisite technique, but this was a match for demolition experts rather than architects of footballing beauty. Mascherano was the man swinging the wrecking ball into Holland’s midfield throughout. And he did all of this after an early clash of heads left him briefly unconscious.

In a team featuring Lionel Messi, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Gonzalo Higuain, plus Sergio Aguero and Angel di Maria when fit (and Carlos Tevez when selected), it is easy to forget about Mascherano. He breaks up play, passes the ball simply and goes about his business with the minimum of fuss, apart from the odd scything tackle here or there. You might say he rarely catches the eye, but he often catches the shin.

Mascherano doesn’t even play in his favoured midfield position for his club. Barcelona have instead squeezed him into the side as an auxiliary centre-back since his move to the Nou Camp in 2010, although that may change next season under new boss Luis Enrique.

Star man: Lionel Messi will carry the hopes of his nation in the final against Germany 

Wrecking ball: But it is Mascherano's grit and graft that could prove decisive, as it did against Holland

Javier Mascherano (Argentina) 478

Philipp Lahm (Germany) 458

Toni Kroos (Germany) 443

Daley Blind (Holland) 323

Stefan de Vrij (Holland) 323

Oscar (Brazil) 30

Mehrdad Pooladi (Iran) 19

Javier Mascherano (Argentina) 18

Kyle Beckerman (USA) 18

Luiz Gustavo (Brazil) 17

Liverpool fans will recognise the wisdom in that decision. After his bizarre arrival in English football alongside Tevez at West Ham in 2006, Mascherano moved to Anfield a year later and made his name as one of European football’s toughest-tackling midfield spoilers. Liverpool were powerless to stop him joining Barca, where he has faded from view somewhat, stuck behind Sergio Busquets and Alex Song in the defensive midfield pecking order.

But this World Cup has provided a timely reminder of just how effective a midfielder Mascherano is. At 30 years-of-age and with 104 caps to his name, the former Corinthians and River Plate star was able to call on a vast wealth of experience to rescue his county when they needed him most.

The statistics also show that Mascherano has had a highly effective World Cup overall, having made more tackles than any other players apart from Brazil’s Oscar and Mehrdad Pooladi of Iran (google him).

But the more eyecatching number posted by Mascherano is the amount of successful passes he has completed in Brazil – 478 and counting, the highest of any player at the World Cup so far - at a rate of 86.6 per cent.

Argentina owe their passage to the World Cup final as much to that tackle on Robben as to any of Messi’s four goals in Brazil. And if they are to claim the game’s ultimate prize in the Maracana on Sunday, it will depend on Mascherano's ability to roll up his sleeves and dismantle the German passing machine.
