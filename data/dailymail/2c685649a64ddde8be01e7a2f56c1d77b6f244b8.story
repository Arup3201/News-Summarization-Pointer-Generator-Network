British trio Laura Robson, Heather Watson and Anne Keothavong led a star-studded female cast as the tennis world's top stars hit The Roof Gardens in Kensington for a pre-Wimbledon party.

Maria Sharapova, world No 1 and defending Wimbledon champion Serena Williams, Ana Ivanovic and Petra Kvitova were among those to swop their trainers for heels at the WTA's event on Thursday night in London.

And they were joined by world No 2 Victoria Azarenka, Daniele Hantuchova, Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Agnieszka Radwanska and more.

The women dazzled on the red carpet, but they will be even keener to showcase their tennis prowess on the lush green courts at SW19 next week.

British
 No 1 Robson appeared far more relaxed once more after recently 
swearing loudly when on court and she will represent Britain's greatest 
hopes of success when the women's tournament gets underway.

She
 may have her work cut out however, with Sharapova and defending 
champion Williams in impressive form in the build up to the Grand 
Slam.

Robson was knocked out of the Aegon International at Eastbourne earlier this week after a 6-4, 6-4 second round defeat by Caroline Wozniacki.

Eyes on the prize: Ana Ivanovic and Serena Williams are both targeting glory at Wimbledon

Williams defeated Sharapova 6-4, 6-4 in 
the French Open final earlier this month and there is little to suggest 
they will not be among the favourites again.

Ivanovic missed last year's tournament through injury and is clearly happy to be in a position to compete once more while Kvitova, the 2011 champion, could again be a threat if she gains some consistency.

On Thursday night, however, their guards were all down before next week's serious business begins.
