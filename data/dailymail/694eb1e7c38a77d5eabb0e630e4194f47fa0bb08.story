Jailed: Grandmother-of-two Carla Buckle was sentenced to eight weeks in prison after she was taken to court for failing to pay £3,500 in council tax

A grandmother-of-two who was jailed over unpaid council tax was freed just in time to spend Christmas at home with her family after an online appeal raised enough money to pay off her debts.  

Carla Buckle was sentenced to eight weeks in prison after she was taken to court for failing to pay £3,500 in council tax.

But, just 48 hours before Christmas, the 52-year-old was released from HMP Bronzefield near Ashford, Surrey, after supporters donated more than £1,500 to cover the remainder of her bill.

A viral online campaign was launched to free the grandmother, on the grounds that she was on a low income and devoted her time to caring for others in her community.

Mrs Buckle, of Newbury, Berkshire, was said to be a carer on a zero-hours contract, earning just £7 an hour for around 25 hours a week. 

It was claimed that this left her without the means to pay the bill from West Berkshire Council.

The man who led the campaign to free the grandmother said she had been 'overwhelmed' with the support she had received.

He said: 'She was over the moon, absolutely overwhelmed with all the support and the work that has been going on behind the scenes to get her released. She was quite unaware of it.

'She's back home now. She's having a lovely Christmas with her family.'

When she was jailed at Reading Magistrates' Court on November 18, it was only the second time the district council had been granted a custodial sentence for the non-payment of council tax.

Mrs Buckle owed £3,500 in council tax at the time, which was reduced by £60 for each day she was in prison.

Speaking at the time of the conviction, the council's executive member for finance, Alan Law, said: 'We are all obliged to pay council tax to cover the cost of numerous essential services and it is totally unfair for some people to think that this shared responsibility does not apply to them.

'I hope that this sentence gives a clear message that expecting others to pay will not be tolerated.'

Campaigners insisted Mrs Buckle was a civilian, not a criminal, who had been held in unlawful custody. An online petition calling for her release garnered 1,671 signatures.

The High Court review granted the mother-of-three immediate bail and a judicial review application will be heard in January.

A West Berkshire Council spokesman said they had simply brought the case forward to try to retrieve the money and the court decided the sentence.

The council and the prison where Mrs Buckle was held said they could not comment any further on individual cases.

Speaking ahead of Mrs Buckle's release, her spokesman said: 'We have been invited to turn up with cash at the prison and pay Carla's council tax bill to them directly - and she will be released immediately.

'How utterly ridiculous in 2014 - we still have the Poor Laws in operation and debtors' private prisons. 

'It's completely against Carla's human and constitutional rights to be jailed for a debt she cannot afford and has no contract for.'

Writing on Facebook, Mrs Buckle thanked her supporters and said she was grieving for her uncle who had passed away while she was behind bars.

She said: 'To everyone that wrote to me and have sent me messages, I am not ignoring you and will get back to everyone in the near future and hope you understand that I am busy helping the heroes that put time and effort at the expense of pushing their own social lives aside for me and their sleep, to put a case together and get me out of hell.

'I'm also recovering from my traumatic experience and grieving for my uncle and saddened I couldn't be with my mother at such as sad time when she needed me the most.'
