Supermodel Beverly Johnson said  that she has finally spoken out about her alleged drugging by Bill Cosby because he 'had taken her power and she was taking it back'.

Johnson, 62, who made history as the first black woman to appear on the cover of American Vogue in 1974, on Thursday joined the ranks of two dozen women to accuse the comedian of attacking them, with some claiming to have been raped and sexually assaulted by the star.

The former model and businesswoman recounted the terrifying moment that she realized she had been drugged in interviews, aired on Friday.

In 1986, Johnson had visited Cosby's New York brownstone to read through lines for a small part on The Cosby Show.

Following a light dinner, Johnson said that Cosby insisted she try a cappuccino from his expensive espresso-maker, adding  'it would be the best cup of coffee she would ever have'.  

Johnson told Today: 'I felt something from the first sip and it was like I didn't believe it, so I took another sip and I felt the effects of being drugged. The room began to spin and I got woozy, I was on the verge of passing out.' 

She described the effects of the drug 'like a train coming on', to CBS. 

In a separate interview she told GMA: 'I knew I had been drugged and drugged really good...I knew I was in danger.'

The 62-year-old recalled how she went into 'survival mode' and began to swear and curse at Cosby 'because I wanted him to know that I knew he had drugged me'. 

Johnson claimed that she began to verbally abuse the star as he came towards her and placed his hands on her waist. 

She told him: 'You are a motherf***** aren’t you?', according to the detailed Vanity Fair account, published on Thursday.

Johnson does not think that Cosby sexually assaulted her.  

She said cursing at Cosby appeared to make him angry. She claimed he then grabbed her by the arm and dragged her down stairs with force, pulling her out into the street and dumping her in a taxi.

Initially, Johnson said, she was worried about calling Bill Cosby a 'motherf*****'.

She told People: 'I didn't know that he was raping women. That came out years after, and … it became more ugly and more sinister and more violent and dangerous. But at that point, I was an aspiring actress and I was scared.'

'I woke up the next day, totally disoriented,' she said. 'I remembered what had happened and I was devastated and disappointed.'

Ms Johnson said that it took several days for the effects of the drug to wear off and that when they did, she called Cosby to confront him.

Instead of the comedian, his wife Camille answered the phone and told her that it was too late for her husband to take the call and she should call back.

She never did.  

'At a certain moment it became clear that I would be fighting a losing battle with a powerful man so callous he not only drugged me, but he also gave me the number to the bedroom he shared with his wife,' Ms Johnson wrote in the magazine.

'In the end, just like the other women, I had too much to lose to go after Bill Cosby.' 

In interviews on Friday, the former model also addressed why she waited 30 years to reveal her story. 

She said at the time of the alleged drugging, she had just gone through an 'ugly divorce' with an ensuing bitter custody battle for her daughter. 

The model said that she felt she was risking her career to make the accusations public against such a revered entertainer. 

She said: 'At the time, I felt it would hurt my career. He was a very powerful, formidable man.'

But now, Johnson said that having watched other women come forward, including her friend of 30 years and fellow model Janice Dickinson, gave her the courage to speak out. 

Johnson told People: 'I thought I'm the lucky one, because I didn't get raped.' 

'I want to stand with these women who have come out,' she said on Friday. 'I want to have a platform for one out of every six women who are sexually assaulted during their lives.'

Johnson referred specifically to Dickinson - whose story was called 'a fabricated lie' by Cosby's attorney. She said that Dickinson was 'unfiltered' and that 'you only get the truth from Janice'.

The former model said that she does not plan to take legal action against Bill Cosby.

She added: 'This is bigger than Bill Cosby, this is about women and violence on women.

'I feel Bill Cosby took my power and that I took my power back.' 

The supermodel's allegations bring the total number of women who have come forward to accuse Cosby to 24.

Ms Johnson wrote in Vanity Fair that another part of her reason for staying silent on Cosby was that she didn't want to be an 'angry black woman' going after highly-regarded man in the African-American community.

The businesswoman said that the current racial climate in the U.S. and the cases of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner remained in her mind, even as she saw others come forward to claim that they had been attacked by Bill Cosby.

Something clicked. 'I couldn’t sit back and watch the other women be vilified and shamed for something I knew was true,' Ms Johnson told Vanity Fair. 

In the article, she also addressed why she had not included the Cosby allegations in her memoir published last year. 

Ms Johnson said she feared a 'he-said/she-said' scenario but now felt the time was right to come forward. 

She also said that she no longer feared damaging the African-American community by making her allegations against Cosby. 

She added: 'He brought this on himself when he decided he had the right to have his way with who knows how many women over the last four decades.'
