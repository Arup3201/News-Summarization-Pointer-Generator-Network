Poor pupils will be allowed to jump the queue for places at all primary and secondary schools in England, the Government has confirmed.

Ministers have torn up admission rules that forbid selection on the basis of family finances.

This will let state schools give low income youngsters top priority in return for extra cash as part of a flagship policy by Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg.

Pupils from low income families will be allowed to jump the admission queue under a new Lib Dem policy 

The shake-up comes despite critics warning of ‘large numbers of children being unable to access their local school. The revised School Admissions Code will come into force in December.

It allows primaries and secondaries to give ‘admission priority’ to children eligible for the Pupil Premium – extra money to encourage them to take in more disadvantaged youngsters. At present, only free schools and academies can do this.

In addition, primaries will be able to give priority for reception places to disadvantaged youngsters who attend their nurseries.

There will be no legal requirement for schools to change their admissions criteria.

Mr Clegg’s Pupil Premium is worth £1,300 per primary school pupil and £935 for secondary school children.

More than half of England’s 163 state grammars have already indicated they plan to rewrite admissions criteria to give priority to poorer pupils.

The Government launched a consultation on the proposed changes in July, leading critics to warn of a potential ‘detrimental impact’ on some families.

The Department for Education said: ‘This change…will provide all schools who wish to use it with a practical means to support the most disadvantaged in society.’

It added: ‘Many respondents were in agreement with the principle of this change, but some expressed concerns that schools would be required to adopt it, or that it would lead to large numbers of other children being unable to access their local school.

The new plan is part of a new flagship Lib Dem policy by leader Nick Clegg 

‘As stated in the consultation document, there will be no requirement for admission authorities to include such a priority in their admission arrangements. This will be an option open to schools, who may adopt it if they wish.’

In a further change, the government is making it clear to schools that parents of summer-born children can ask for them to start reception classes at five – a year later than usual.

Education officials must consider each request and state reasons for refusal.

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, yesterday accused the government of ‘continually meddling’ with school admissions.

He said: ‘Favouring pupils from low income homes means that other pupils will miss out on their local schools.

‘Quite why schools should be guided to prioritise poor children over, say, high ability children is not at all clear.

‘If I were a parent with a particular school in mind who couldn’t get a place because of this, then I would be very upset indeed.’

Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, has previously warned that parents of eligible Pupil Premium children may ‘feel under pressure’ to enrol them in a school nursery early instead of a childminder in order to gain priority for reception places.

He said he was concerned about the ‘potentially detrimental impact this could have on children and families’.

Last year’s annual report from the Office of the Schools Adjudicator said that the ‘practice of some primary schools of giving priority for admission to the reception year to children who have attended particular nursery provision has been found to be unfair to other local children’.
