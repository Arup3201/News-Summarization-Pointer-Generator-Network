The two Bronx men who lost their wives, daughters and other family members in a deadly crash on Sunday which claimed seven lives visited the site yesterday at 12.30pm - exactly 24 hours after the fatal crash occurred.

Ramon Rosario was joined by Juan Gonzalez as both men summoned up the strength to see the place their families met their end in a wooded area of the Bronx Zoo.

Mr Rosario, whose wife Maria Nunez, 35, and daughters Niely, seven, and Marly Rosario, three, perished in the crash, told the New york Post: 'I know what happened, but I wanted to see how it happened.'

Grieving: The two Bronx men - Ramon Rosario, left, and Juan Gonzalez - who lost their wives, young daughters and in-laws in a deadly crash Sunday somehow summoned the courage to visit the site yesterday

Juan Gonzalez lost his wife Maria Gonzalez, 45, and daughter Jazlyn, ten. He said: 'The family is destroyed right now. We lost three generations.

'We wanted to see how they lost their lives and also what the city is doing for protection [along the highway]. It’s not secure.'

Another victim: Marly Rosario, three, was one of the seven killed on Sunday

Maria Nunez and Gonzalez were sisters. Their parents Jacob Nunez, 85, and Ana Julia Martinez, 81,were also killed in the crash.

Seven other relatives of the crash victims joined them as they made their grim pilgrimage to the crash site.

According to the Post, Rosario and Gonzalez studied skid marks on the roadway and scuffs in a two-foot concrete curb that served as the launching point for the vehicle.

As the two men cautiously leaned over the guardrail to peer down at where their family took their last breaths.

Traffic slowed to take in the grieving family, with some shouting messages of support from the windows.

The van is believed to have been speeding when it crashed, crossing two lanes of traffic and going over the railing.

Police believe it was traveling at 68mph in a 40mph zone.

Relatives said another family member could have perished as Maria Gonzalez's son Jeury, 12, was supposed to be in the car to go to baseball practice but was not ready in time.

The boy was said to be inconsolable and telling relatives he wishes he had been in the car.

Jazlyn was looking forward to receiving her first communion this Saturday at St Raymond’s Church in The Bronx.

'We had her outfit ready, but now we plan on burying her in her first communion dress,' said Simon Torres, 53, the girl’s uncle.

Grandparents: Ana Julia Martinez, 81, and her 85-year-old husband Jacob Nunez died in the horrific crash

Yesterday morning, in an emotional interview with the New York Daily News, Mr Gonzalez said he was 'destroyed' by the news, crying: 'I don't want to live anymore,' he said.

Mr Gonzalez, a livery cab driver, 
shared a home not far from the crash site with his wife, a maintenance 
worker at Fordham University.

The Daily News reports the couple was working to pay for college for their 18-year-old son, Jonel.

Mr Gonzalez said the family had been to church earlier in the day.

The newspaper reports relatives said 
her sister, Maria Nunez, worked for a school bus company in the Bronx 
and had three daughters.

Tragic: The wreckage of the minivan lies in the grounds of New York's Bronx zoo. Seven people inside the van died after it fell 59ft from a freeway on Sunday

Police and emergency workers investigated the Bronx crash, which looks to be the deadliest in New York in the past year

Investigation: The car crashed into a non-public, heavily wooded area of the zoo and was not near any visitors or exhibits

Rescue work: Multiple emergency teams worked together to salvage clues from the scene

Police say Jacob Nunez and Ana Julia 
Martinez were staying with Maria Gonzalez at her home in the Bronx while
visiting from the Dominican Republic.

According to the News, the elders had a total of 13 children, six of whom lived in the U.S.; seven remain in Santo Domingo.

They are believed to have arrived on Thursday for a two-month stay.

Their son, Ignacio Nunez, 64, lost two sisters, his parents and three nieces.

'The injuries were quite horrific. In 30 years I've seen something like this once or twice.'

-EMS deputy chief Howard Sickles

'I went to the hospital. They’re all dead,' he told the Daily News.

'I don’t know how to feel,' he said. 'I feel very, very bad.'

The family of seven died after their minivan plummeted 59ft from the Bronx River Parkway.

Police say Mrs Gonzalez was at the wheel of a white 2004 Honda Pilot when it vaulted off an overpass.

A police source told MailOnline all 
seven of the victims had to be extracted from the crashed vehicle and 
were pronounced dead at the scene.

According to a police report, the van 
was headed south Sunday afternoon around 12:30pm on the Bronx River 
Parkway, a highway in the north of the city.

Area: The minivan crashed into the grounds of Bronx Zoo

The vehicle then bounced off the median, crossed all southbound lanes over to the guardrail and fell 59ft.

The car landed in a heavily-overgrown area of the Zoo grounds, which made the recovery difficult for emergency workers.

No criminality is suspected.

One fire fighter suffered minor injuries sustained on the scene.

'It’s terrible, just carnage. The passengers didn’t stand a chance,' an unidentified fire department source told The New York Post.

Police
say Jacob Nunez and Ana Julia Martinez were staying with Maria Gonzalez
at her home in the Bronx while visiting from the Dominican Republic.

The nearly Bronx Zoo, which is the largest metropolitan zoo in the world, is run by the Wildlife Conservation Society.

A representative for the Conservation Society told NY1
that the crash did not take place 'anywhere near the Bronx Zoo's 
exhibits or visitors'.

The injuries were quite horrific,' EMS Deputy Chief Howard Sickles told DNA Info.

'In
30 years I've seen something like this once or twice. Everybody was 
taken aback by it because everybody has a relative, everybody knows a 
child and everybody has a grandparent. ... It's very upsetting.'

The southbound side of the highway was closed Sunday afternoon while police investigated.

Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. said that he will be ordering a safety examination by the relevant authorities in light of the accident.

This is the worst crash New York has seen in over a year, since 14 people died in a bus crash on Interstate 95 headed back from Mohegan Sun casino to Chinatown.

A similar- though non-fatal- accident occurred at the same spot last June when an SUV bounced off the guard rail and fell off the overpass. In that incident, two people inside the car were injured but there were no deaths.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this tragic time,' Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.
