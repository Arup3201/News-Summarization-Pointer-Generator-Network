Lee had his charge upgraded after being initially charged with cruelty to children on Saturday.

Captain Christopher Bish had earlier told MailOnline: 'We are seeking to upgrade the charge to felony murder.'

Lee is not the child's father and the mother has not been named, police said.

Paramedics were called to a home in Madison by Lee on Saturday after reports that the baby had stopped breathing.

Lee was looking after the baby at the time, according to ajc.com. He told emergency services that the baby had fallen off a couch.

Captain Bish told local news that babies do not get such severe injuries from falling off couches.

Police searched the home on Saturday night but would not comment on the results.

Lee is being held without bond.
