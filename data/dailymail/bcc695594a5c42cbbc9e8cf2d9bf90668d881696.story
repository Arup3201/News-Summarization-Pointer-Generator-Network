No gain, just pain: Sarah, 33, suffered burns after a 'fat-freezing' treatment

After an ‘horrendous’ divorce, Sarah Hall decided to boost her confidence with a cosmetic treatment – and picked one that promised permanent fat reduction in just one session of ‘freezing’.

But instead of returning home with a sleeker silhouette and a spring  in her step, she was left burned, in agony, and possibly scarred.

Only afterwards did Sarah, 33, discover the practitioner who carried out the botched ‘fat freezing’ procedure last month at the Starbright skin clinic, in Liverpool, was actually trained as a hairdresser.

The case emerged last week as  the 
Government faced heavy criticism for failing to regulate the cosmetic 
treatment industry despite  a major review and a campaign by The Mail on
 Sunday.

Sarah is now 
considering legal action against the clinic, which she found through a 
discount voucher site offering prices reduced from £1,200 to a tempting 
£169 to treat two areas on her stomach.

It
 is the sort of hard-sell tactic  this newspaper is calling to see 
stamped out, as it puts undue pressure on potential patients. Yet the 
Department of Health has failed  to address this issue.

The
 treatment Sarah underwent, marketed as an alternative to liposuction, 
targets specific problem areas using a machine-based probe that freezes 
fat cells through the skin until they apparently die and are metabolised
 by the body.

But within 
hours, the skin on Sarah’s stomach went from feeling numb and white with
 cold to blisteringly hot and bright red. The inflammation was so 
painful she felt sick.

‘It was worse than sunburn,’ she said.
 ‘I couldn’t stand, sit or lie because movement or anything touching the
 affected area felt like being poked by a hot iron. Sleeping was impossible because I couldn’t bear even a sheet on top of me.’

She
 contacted the clinic and sent the pictures of the ever darkening 
lesions on her abdomen. But in the clinic told her: ‘We know it does 
rarely occur after treatment. It looks like a superficial infection.’ 
The clinic advised Sarah to keep the area clean and take painkillers. 
Later, they suggested applying an antibiotic cream.

A
 week later, in despair, Sarah  saw her GP, who confirmed she had 
serious burns – akin to frostbite. The doctor was able only to offer 
cream to prevent infection.

‘The
 intense pain lasted six days, during which time the skin began to 
blister and I wasn’t able to sleep or work,’ said Sarah, who runs her 
own graphic design and marketing agency in Port Sunlight on the Wirral. 
‘It felt like I had been branded.’

And she may well be left with a permanent reminder of the procedure as 
she has been told it is too early  to predict if her skin will fully 
recover. ‘I don’t know if there’s nerve damage,’ Sarah added. ‘When I 
grab that flesh with my fingers, it’s completely numb.’

When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, Starbright manager Glenn Pringle admitted her therapist was only qualified as  a hairdresser. Later, he tried to retract his statement, saying it was incorrect because he was ‘caught on the hop’. He also claimed that  the ‘therapist’ was fully trained in using the machine.

The Department of Health last week pledged to set up a committee of doctors to help the General Medical Council make cosmetic surgery a speciality in its own right. This was in response to last year’s Keogh Review of the Regulation of Cosmetic Interventions, which called for a major overhaul in regulation.

But the government fell short of saying there should be a requirement for those offering these operations to become specialists, meaning doctors still would not need to be qualified in cosmetic surgery in order to perform it. And there was widespread dismay that those offering non-surgical treatments, such as Botox, fillers, lasers and fat reduction, would not be brought into line.

Instead, non-medical professionals – including hairdressers – will continue to be able to offer and carry out these life-changing procedures.

Cryolipolysis targets specific problem areas using a machine-based probe that freezes fat cells through the skin until they apparently die and are metabolised by the body

Nigel Mercer, former president  of the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons, believes Sarah’s case again highlights how British patients are being left wide open to the horrifying consequences of cowboy cosmetic practitioners.

He said: ‘This new guidance from the Department of Health is yet another missed opportunity to protect patients. It beggars belief that  an untrained operator can be put in charge of aesthetic medical equipment, with the result that a woman may now be permanently scarred.

‘And the involvement of voucher sites is outrageous. You wouldn’t go to a voucher site for a hip replacement, so why would you use it for an aesthetic medical treatment?’

Sarah added: ‘I wasn’t expecting miracles, just a kickstart to a new fitness regime and I did my research on this treatment without finding a bad review. The clinic’s address, in Rodney Street in Liverpool, is known as the Harley Street of the North, and that reassured me, too.’

The clinic referred to the treatment as Cryolipolysis which, according to Starbright’s website, is ‘a celebrity favourite’ and has ‘numerous clinical trials citing its effectiveness’. But Cryolipolysis is a trademark of US company Zeltiq, for the fat-freezing process it pioneered as its own treatment, CoolSculpting.

CoolSculpting does have clinical trials to support its claims, as well as approval from US regulators the Food & Drug Administration.

Yet Zeltiq said it never sold any of its equipment to Starbright. The firm added: ‘We would be concerned to discover that a hairdresser would be involved in a treatment using Cryolipolysis technology. Our providers are all fully qualified, leading plastic surgeons, dermatologists and medical aesthetic specialists.’

The company is particularly worried about copycat or counterfeit devices that do not have a ‘kill switch’ to detect and stop treatment when skin has reached a temperature beyond which damage can occur.

Starbright has told Sarah it hasn’t had any other clients report similar injury. But she argues this is little consolation if she ends up scarred.

She added: ‘After years of having my confidence knocked, I’d just started dating again but I can’t take my clothes off in front of anyone now. I just hope other women think twice about purchasing treatments through voucher sites.’
