Tom Brady experienced a career high on Sunday when he led his team The New England Patriots to a Super Bowl win over the Seattle Seahawks.

And on Wednesday it was time to celebrate properly.

The 37-year-old football star took his son Benjamin, aged five,  to a Patriots parade in snowy Boston.

Fans chanted 'Brady! Brady!' and clambered atop massive snowbanks for better views as players danced and waved, according to local Boston site WCVB.com.

'Well-wishers blew kisses, pumped their fists and screamed themselves hoarse from behind barriers as the team rolled through downtown aboard the World War II-style amphibious duck boat vehicles that have become a staple of the city's championship parades,' the site added. 

Some fans climbed on piles of snow left from last week's blizzard to get a glimpse of Brady, coach Bill Belichick and other players.

There were also the wives and girlfriends of the players.

Confetti was thrown in the air and the Lombardi trophy was waved around.

Fans wore No. 12 Brady jerseys, shouted the MVP's name and held 'We are the CHAMPIONS' placards, the site added.

Gisele was on hand in Arizona on Sunday to plant a kiss on her spouse of nearly six years after he led his team to a victory.

Dressed in a plaid shirt and with her blonde locks flowing down her back, the Chanel spokesperson looked casual for the massive event, which was watched by more than 114m people.
