Wanted: Leilani Novak-Garcia, pictured, who goes by the pseudonym 'Hitler' is on the run after allegedly stabbing a man multiple times at the annual Rainbow Family gathering that is taking place in a Utah national forest

A hippie who goes by the pseudonym 'Hitler' is on the run after allegedly stabbing a man multiple times at the annual Rainbow Family gathering that is taking place in a Utah national forest.

Authorities in Wasatch County today released a photograph of Leilani Novak-Garcia, 32, who they claim screamed 'I'll kill you,' before pouncing on the unidentified man just before 1 a.m. this morning.

Uinta National Forest rangers discovered the man who suffered two stab wounds. His age and current condition are not known.

According to the Heber City Police Department's Facebook page, Novak-Garcia left the campsite before sheriff's deputies could arrive.

They believe, however, she may still be in the Heber City area.

She is described as 5 feet 9 inches tall and 170 pounds with hazel eyes and black hair, which she wears in dreadlocks.

According to Novak-Garcia's own Facebook page, she lives in New Orleans.

Police in the area had been bracing for nudity, drugs and general free-spiritedness during the counterculture gathering that began near Salt Lake City last week.

The unorthodox crowds even compelled a pair of nearby Mormon church-owned girls' summer camps to move elsewhere.

The first attendees began setting up camp at the annual Rainbow Family gathering, where attendance is expected to total about 10,000, on June 20.

They have started building kitchens and setting up tents in advance of their July 4 celebration.

Most visitors have come without incident through the closest town of Heber City, said Wasatch County Sheriff's Deputy Jared Rigby said last week.

But a few menaces had already rankled locals in the town of 12,000 prior to the frightening stabbing incident.

The town is dotted with churches and bordered by vast fields and ranches.

Some revelers last week crashed a nearby wedding reception in search of food.

Police
 also expect to find marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine in coming 
weeks, but aren't saying whether the drugs have already turned up.

They have doubled their force with help from the state in response to the expanding population.

'We don't deal with a lot of panhandling, people asking for handouts,' Rigby said.

'We don't have a lot of lewdness or public urination.'

With
 only about 200 participants, the gathering Sunday logged one death when
 a 39-year-old New Hampshire woman was found on the site hunkered around
 a bend in the Duchesne River, Rigby said.

She apparently died in her sleep, he added.

A total of around 10,000 people are expected to attend this years Rainbow Family festival in northern Utah, with attendees already starting to arrive for the July 4 celebrations. Here participants attend festival at Oscala National Forest in Florida in 2012

The Rainbow Family are committed to peace and egalitarianism and have thrown annual events every year - almost always in out-of-the-way parks and forests - since the 1970s

The Rainbow Family has no formal structure or leaders. An informal council decides each year where the gathering will be held. For years, the decisions have sparked court battles with the Forest Service over the group's right to gather without a permit

For the most part, participants have cooperated with officials, asking how they can limit their toll on the land at the spot about 40 miles east of Salt Lake City, said Dave Whittekiend of the Forest Service.

'People have approached and asked, ''How can we be lighter on the ground; how can we minimize those impacts?'" he said.

They
 have 'been very open' to requests of biologists, who barred the group 
from setting up camp within 200 feet of the river, Whittekiend said.

It's
 the first year the annual event has come to Utah since 2003, when it 
set up on the northern side of the same mountain range.

It has convened every year since 1972.

Last
 year, the group chose Montana's Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest, 
where law enforcement costs related to the gathering totaled $575,000, 
according to the Forest Service.

Officers issued hundreds of citations but only arrested two people out of 10,000.

Officials
 there compiled a list of lessons learned, advising their counterparts 
in other states to make clear where participants may camp, set up fires 
and retrieve water.

The Rainbow Family has no official leaders and no one website or member list.

Its creed revolves around nonviolence, inclusiveness and praying for peace, according to a number of websites asserting ties to the group.

The gatherings take the name 'rainbow' because they aim to incorporate a spectrum of people and cultures, says one website.

Jan Olpin, co-owner of the Dairy Keen, spotted a group in recent days rummaging through the eatery's garbage, 'so I said, ''Here's your cheeseburger with some soup, fries and a drink''.'

That's a one-off, she said: Police are urging against such donations.

At a community meeting, officials said the festival would boost local business, quelling anxiety, Olpin said.

Some pledged to welcome the visitors but also vowed to lock their cars.

'The whole audience kind of agreed we need to do what's best for Heber and make these people feel welcome,' Olpin said, 'yet be vigilant'.
