These rare photographs show the hard labour of Victorian miners digging for tin deep below the earth in extremely dangerous conditions.

The images, taken in the darkness of four separate mines in Cornwall, were captured with the help of very early flash technology, which allowed photographer J.C. Burrow to bring the underground world to life.

Published in 1893, Mr Burrow's photographs show the miners clambering through the warren of tunnels, held up by precarious wooden beams, as they dug out tin and copper and to fuel industrial Britain.

Toil: A bare-chested miner can be seen pushed a cart through Cook's Kitchen Mine in Cornwall, as fellow miners operate the machinery

Illuminated: Photographer J.C. Burrow used rudimentary flash technology to light up the underground scenes

The workers toiled in very harsh conditions - often for little pay - all the while breathing in filthy air under the ground. Accidents were common - indeed at Dolcoath, one of the mines pictured, seven men were crushed after timber supports gave way around the same time the photographs were published.

Some frames show the miners hard at work, drilling bore holes into the rock and setting up heavy machinery - while another shows them at rest, eating traditional Cornish pasties.

Mr Burrow was commissioned to take the photographs by local mine owners, who wanted to showcase the technology used in their underground enterprise. The illustrated guide which he produced - 'Mongst Mines and Miners: Underground Scenes by Flash-Light - was later used as a teaching aid.

At least four separate mines were featured in his book - Dolcoath, a copper and tin mine in Camborne; East Pool in Redruth; Blue Hills tin mine in St Agnes, and Cook's Kitchen mine in Pool.

Hard at it: In this frame the miners can be seen boring into the rock. The tin and copper from Cornish mines sold for millions across the nation

Cramped: Mines would often have to scrambled between the beams in claustrophobic conditions

At ease: In this more relaxed picture the miners are seen at rest, as many of them eat Cornish pasties

In order to illuminate his photographs Mr Burrow rigged up a system of lamps filled with highly flammable magnesium powder. He then instructed teams of miners to light the powder, creating a bright flash which allowed him to capture the scene.

The process was difficult, time-consuming and often didn't work - of the 100 images only 24 were deemed printable, and Mr Burrow wrote of how a whole day's work would often turn out to be useless.

In a text describing his efforts, he wrote: 'It is a
 rather disheartening experience to find the results of a whole days 
work with an energetic band of helpers are not "printable", but such 
experience was mine on more than one occasion.

'The
 work, however is so full of interest, and its performance so productive
 of welcome enlightenment on many critical points, that I have no 
intention of allowing it to remain where it is. I hope that at no distant date, the present attempt may be followed by another and more successful one.'

Technology: J.C. Burrows was commissioned to take the series of photographs to showcase the mines' advances

Widespread: At its peak, the mining industry employed as many as 25 per cent of Cornwall's working men

Heritage: Mr Burrow was commissioned to photograph the mines by their owners, and compiled the results in 'Mongst Mines and Miners: Underground Scenes by Flash-Light, right

Locations: JC Burrows took his photographs in several mines, including East Pool, left, and Blue Hills, right. They are pictured above as they are today

A copy of the book is for sale in an upcoming auction, and is expected to fetch £2,250. It goes under the hammer at this year's PBFA London International Antiquarian Book Fair, on May 23 and 24.

Bookseller Michael Kemp said: 'Mr Burrow was attempting to showcase the mining technology of his age, but in doing so he devised some pretty groundbreaking methods of his own.

'Using explosive materials in the open air would be challenging enough back in 1893, but to do it in the pitch dark confines of an underground mine shaft seems unthinkable.

'Evidently our late Victorian counterparts did not share our modern day obsession with health and safety.'

Cornwall's rich veins of tin and copper have made it a centre of the mining industry since pre-historic times. Cornish mining interests are suggested as one reason for the Roman invasion of Britain, and medieval documents attest to the productivity of the early mines.

But it was with the advent of the industrial revolution when mining in Cornwall really came into its own, prompted by demand for the valuable metals in industrial production. At its peak, mining in Cornwall employed as many as 25 per cent of the county's working men.

Plans: South Crofty was Europe's last functioning tin mine, but closed in 1998. It has been suggested that rising prices could lead to the mine re-opening, but this is yet to happen

Although the conditions underground were unforgiving, the work paid better than the alternatives of fishing or farming. Billions of pounds worth of metal was dragged up from the earth during the industry's late 1800s peak, though the Cornish industry experienced periodic slumps as prices rose and fell due to competition and new technology.

By the latter half of the 19th century many mines in the area had been forced to close thanks to intense competition from mines elsewhere in the world. According to Cornish Mining Heritage, as many as half a million miners left Cornwall between 1815 and 1915, often setting up their own mines in other countries such as Australia, South Africa and the the U.S.

The industry continued in Cornwall - albeit at a much lower capacity - until the late 1990s. South Crofty mine - the last working tin mine in Europe - remained open until 1998. Plans have been suggested to re-open the mine in light of increased global tin prices, but have yet to materialise.
