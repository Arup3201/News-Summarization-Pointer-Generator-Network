Imperious: Prince and Princess Michael of Kent attend a wedding in 2009

In her imperious way, she has always been keen to stress her blue-blooded lineage.

So it should come as no surprise that Princess Michael of Kent has drawn up a list of socially acceptable wives for her husband should she die before him.

The Austrian aristocrat, whose demeanour earned her the nickname Princess Pushy, has told Prince Michael of Kent that there are only three women worthy of succeeding her.

She tells Tatler magazine: ‘I said, “If I died, these are three people I’d like you to look at marrying because I think they’d be good for you.” I’m sorry, I’m very European about these things. Englishwomen don’t talk like this, I know.’

The 68-year-old adds: ‘I also said, “If you died first, I have to think about whether I’d stay here or go back to Austria.” I’m allowed to stay here – if I pay the rent!’

In an unintentionally hilarious interview to be published next week, Princess Michael of Kent offers the society bible a deliciously indiscreet insight into life at the heart of the Royal Family.

She and Prince Michael, 71, the Queen’s first cousin, live in a former grace-and-favour apartment at Kensington Palace.

Neighbours there are Prince William and his wife Kate, who recently moved into a four-storey, 20-room home that once belonged to Princess Margaret. Although there was talk of William taking his mother’s former apartment next to her own, Princess Michael says she always thought Kate would get ‘the wobblies’ living there amid so many memories of Diana.

She also reveals that Prince Harry has his eye on the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester’s house at the palace.

Of the Cambridges’ new apartment she says: ‘Right where Princess Margaret was! And you know, I was very much behind that. Because it’s the nicest apartment. The intelligence of the courtiers!

‘When Princess Margaret died, they gave it to the museum [the apartment was handed to Historic Royal Palaces for display and office space].

'And, obviously, the boy was going to marry one day. He’d need the best apartment, surely. A lovely big garden, next to the Gloucesters, who I think will leave... they’re rattling around this huge space.

‘And I think Prince Harry might go there, then they’d be next door to each other – very good move. And also, I thought she [Kate] would get the wobblies if she moved next door [into Diana’s former flat].

'You know, with [the ghost of] Diana. And I might lose my garden! Anyway, that apartment, it’s not the best. Whereas Princess Margaret’s – wonderful. Huge private garden, you know. And then they could open up into the garden next door. I’m sure Prince Harry wouldn’t mind. It would work wonderfully.’

Princess Michael, born Marie-Christine von Reibnitz in the Bohemian spa city of Carlsbad, takes great pains to spell out her impressive ancestry, which according to her includes at least two kings and dozens of dukes.

‘I have great lineage. As you know,’ she says. ‘Even Catherine de Medici and Diana de Poitiers [the first a French queen and mother of three French kings, the second the mistress of Henry II of France], I descend from them both.

'And sometimes people say, “Oh well, we all descend from Adam and Eve.” But do you descend from Charlemagne directly? Do you descend from Saint King Louis IX? I do.’

She reveals that her 1978 marriage was ‘arranged’ by Prince Charles’s great uncle, Lord Mountbatten, after she met Prince Michael at a party in the early 1970s. Romance blossomed only when he pushed them together.

‘I realised afterwards that Mountbatten thought I’d be good for my husband,’ she says. ‘He was our Cyrano de Bergerac.’

The issue of money clearly rankles. The Kents have never received taxpayer funding but when they married they were given their elegant five-bedroom apartment by the Queen for a peppercorn rent.

Since 2010, the couple have had to pay £120,000 a year in rent. Princess Michael – who once joked that she would ‘go anywhere for a hot meal’ – has become a speaker on the lecture circuit, dabbles in interior design and has taken on several well-paid consultancies.

She trills that she has done ‘a little bit of decorating in Russia – consultancy. I’ve got five jobs now. Pay the rent!’ She is also a writer. The Tatler interview was granted to publicise her first novel The Queen Of Four Kingdoms, set – unsurprisingly – in the court of 15th century France.

Princess Michael, who says ‘I’m not into fashion, I’m into glamour’, insinuates that she has been given a ‘rough ride’ as a royal but adds: ‘Look, I was taught, and I taught my children, if they ever came back from school saying “Oh, so and so’s father’s got a helicopter, it’s not fair”, I’d say, “Fair? Whoever said life had to be fair? Is it fair that you live in Kensington Palace? That you’ve each got a pony? There are an awful lot of kids without a pony, you know. Life is not meant to be fair.”

‘You’re dealt the cards and you make the best of them. I’ve never worried about that. I’m a survivor.’She agrees, however, that there is at least one upside to being an HRH: ‘Wimbledon! Three days!’ Princess Michael of Kent’s interview is in the January issue of Tatler, on sale from Monday.
