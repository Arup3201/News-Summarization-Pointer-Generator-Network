Visitors to Stonehenge will again be able to experience standing inside the ancient stone circle thanks to a 360-degree cinema.

The battle for access to the World Heritage site has been fought for many years, with campaigners wanting to be allowed into the world-famous monument.

At last, protestors may partially get their wishes, as English Heritage is developing a solution - a virtual visit in a panoramic cinema.

New evidence: Studies of cremated human remains show that a larger stone circle was erected at the same site as a community graveyard

The picturehouse will be the jewel in the crown of a new £27million centre and will include a 32ft landscape wall, on to which computer generated images of the countryside around the circle and other ancient earthworks will be projected.

The new auditorium’s 100ft circumference is smaller than the actual stone circle, which is around 300ft. It’s expected to be built just over a mile from the stones.

Also planned are films providing information about the monument and prehistoric items, exploring theories over the uses of Stonehenge.

Outside the complex, replica Neolithic dwellings are being built, where tourists can find out how early inhabitants of the sites might have lived.

The latest analysis of the remains of a Neolithic settlement near the monument show that thousands of people travelled from as far as Scotland to the site, bringing their livestock and families for huge feasts and celebrations during the winter and summer solstices.

The plans for the centre were revealed in a series of documents from English Heritage, which wants firms to provide the technological content for the audio visual displays, according to the Telegraph.

The documents describe the ‘immersive 360 degree projected film’ as the 'most important and high profile piece of audio visual ever undertaken by EH'.

Robert Campbell, the head of interpretation at the centre, said: ‘It’s meant to give people a sense of what it is like to stand in the middle of Stonehenge because most people just won’t be able to do that.

'It won’t feel like you are standing in a computer programme. The idea is to take our visitors back in time.’

New studies of cremated human remains excavated from the site suggest that about 500 years before the Stonehenge we know today was built, a larger stone circle was erected at the same site as a community graveyard, researchers said.

‘These were men, women, children, so presumably family groups,’ University College London professor Mike Parker Pearson, who led the team, said.

‘We'd thought that maybe it was a place where a dynasty of kings was buried, but this seemed to be much more of a community, a different kind of power structure.’

The virtual visits may not win over 
all campaigners including Pagans and Druids who want open access to 
Stonehenge, which was created about 5,000 years ago.

When
it was first opened to the public, it was possible to walk among and 
even climb on the stones. However, they were roped off in 1977 due to 
problems with erosion.

However, English Heritage does permit access during the summer and winter solstice, and the spring and autumn equinox.

British
researchers have proposed a new theory for the origins of Stonehenge: 
It may have started as a giant burial ground for elite families around 
3,000 B.C.
