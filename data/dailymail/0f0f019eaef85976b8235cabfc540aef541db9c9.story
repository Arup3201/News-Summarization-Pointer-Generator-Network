England are ready for another ‘cup final’ at Twickenham on Saturday, but they are aware of the need for patience despite the expectation of a big win over Italy.

Stuart Lancaster’s national team will go into the second instalment of their RBS Six Nations campaign on the back of an impressive 21-16 victory over Wales in Cardiff. 

They have never lost to their next opponents, but a close encounter in the same fixture two years ago has helped to sharpen English minds and guard against any hint of complacency this week.

The England coaches are confident that their players will have the right mind-set for their next encounter. Andy Farrell said: ‘All you can deal with is preparation and making sure that mentally and emotionally you're in the right place. That's important for tomorrow (Saturday) as well as last week.

‘To win a championship you have five of those cup finals. Emotionally and mentally you have to make sure you're in the right place to put that plan on the field, to have a feel for the game as it's unfolding and do the right thing accordingly.

‘We've had a good week. Earlier in the week we showed them what they did well, what they didn't do well. Mentally we brought them down a bit and then built them back up again. 

'Hopefully tomorrow (Saturday) we'll be at that cup final stage again at the weekend.’

In the last two years, England have finished runners-up in the Six Nations table on points difference, but Farrell claimed that the home team cannot afford to go into the match thinking about the winning margin. 

‘International rugby is not like that, you just have to look at the recent games between us,’ he said. ‘Two of the last three games have been close.

‘The game always takes its own way. What we have to do is be good enough to feel the momentum of the game and how to influence it. The performance will come on the back of that really. 

'To have a fixed plan of how it will unfold in your head before the game isn't reality. If Italy turn up and play exceptionally well, it will be a really tough game, there's no doubt about that.

‘We just need to try and influence our game on them early to try and get what we want from it. We'd have loved to have beaten Wales by 30 points last week. We'd love to have beaten Ireland (last year) by a lot of points as well. Each game is different and it's all swings and roundabouts.’

Lancaster, the head coach, suggested earlier in the week that England have more ‘X-factor’ players at their disposal than at any time before in his tenure. 

Farrell agreed, but added: ‘X-factor is something everyone wants but X-factor is only allowed to come to the fore when you have got forwards who carry the ball, get front-foot ball and then the flair comes on the back of that. 

'X-factor is the icing on the cake but there’s a lot that has to happen before that can come out.’
