The parents of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham have spoken publicly for the first time since their 18-year-old daughter's disappearance last week. 

The Grahams's heartfelt plea for more information on their daughter's disappearance comes as Charlottesville Police have issued an arrest warrant for 'person of interest' Jesse 'LJ' Matthew. 

Matthew is wanted on two counts of reckless driving for speeding away from the police station yesterday afternoon.  

According to Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo, Matthew turned himself into police on Saturday, but quickly left the station after asking to speak with a lawyer. Chief Longo says they are 'aggressively pursuing' Matthew on an arrest warrant for two two unrelated charges.

Heartbroken: John and Sue Graham spoke to reporters on Sunday, to thank locals for their support in searching for their missing daughter

Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo says that an arrest warrant has been issued for Jesse Matthew on unrelated charges

Shaking and with a faltering voice her parents John and Sue Graham held hands as they walked in front of the news cameras for the first time since their daughter disappearance over a week ago. Tears could be seen running down the Mrs Graham's face.

Speaking in a British accent Mr Graham said: ‘As this nightmare for Hannah, for us, for Hannah’s big brother James, her grandparents and extended family continues we would like to make this statement.

‘Hannah is our little girl, our only daughter, James’s little sister. She is also the oldest granddaughter of her grandparents. She is enormously precious to us.' 

Mr Graham then went on to ask anyone with information on Hannah's disappearance to call police, no matter how small the detail.

'All we want to do now is to bring Hannah home safely,' Mr Graham said, before he left the room with his sobbing wife. 

‘Now somebody knows what happened to Hannah. We don’t know who that is. Others who may be watching, they may know something about what happened to Hannah.’

Mr Graham appealed to anyone who saw ‘distinctively-dressed’ Hannah last Friday night.

He said: ‘Did anybody see Hannah? Did you see Hannah? Who saw Hannah? Somebody did. Please if you have anything no matter how insignificant you think it may be please call the tip line.

‘Anything that just might help us to bring Hannah home.’

During the address, Mr Graham held Hannah’s favourite soft toy, a white rabbit called Bibi, aloft.

He said the toy had been Hannah’s ‘constant companion and guardian angel’ until he returned from dropping her off at UVA last month without.

Mr Graham said Bibi was lost for three months when Hannah was six.

But he added: ‘We found Bibi and we brought him home to Hannah. All we want to do is to bring Hannah home safely and please, please, please, help us bring Hannah home.’

Mr Graham said his family had received countless messages of support including one from Hannah’s former High School teacher who said ‘if anyone can get through this it is Hannah.’ 

Meanwhile Virginia State Police have issued an arrest warrant for Jesse ‘LJ’ Matthew the man named by MailOnline as the ‘person of interest’ in the Hannah Graham inquiry.

Police have since conducted searches of Matthew's car (pictured) and house. They are awaiting the results of forensic tests which are due back tomorrow or Tuesday

Longo said he believed Matthew, 32, was the last person to see Hannah ‘before she vanished off the face of the earth’.

Hannah was last seen by friends at Camden Plaza Apartments, in Charlottesville at 11.50pm on Friday night at a party with another male friend and police have said she was heavily intoxicated.

At 1.20am, friends waiting at a party for the student got a text from her saying that she was lost in the area around 14th and Wertland Streets, which is near the student;s own off-campus home.

Surveillance footage released on Wednesday places her half-a-mile away at the Charlottesville downtown mall just 20 minutes before the text.

The 5'11' softball player was wearing black pants and a gold top that had black mesh cut outs on the evening she went missing a week and a day ago.

Chief Longo revealed Matthew had walked into the police station on Saturday afternoon just hours after he was named and his picture appeared on MailOnline.

However, he revealed his frustration as Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital has so far refused to discuss his ‘interaction with Hannah Graham’.

Crucial: The last footage of Hannah is from approximately 30 minutes before she called her friends to say she was lost

Chief Longo said he continued to be ‘very interested’ in talking to Matthew.

And he told how Virginia State Police had issued a warrant to arrest Matthew after he drove ‘recklessly’ to lose police and Federal agents who followed him from the Charlottesville City Police headquarters.

He said: ‘I believe Jesse Matthew was the last person she [Hannah Graham] was seen with before she vanished off the face of the earth.’

The police chief said he believed Matthew was the black man with dreadlocks seen in the video with his arm around Hannah’s waist on the Downtown Mall in the early hours of Saturday morning.

‘I believe that man was Jesse Matthew. I really do,’ he said.

‘I believe Jesse Matthew and Hannah found themselves at the Tempo restaurant. Eye witnesses have told us so. I believe Hannah Graham left Tempo restaurant with Jesse Matthew. In fact I believe that JM was the last person to see Hannah before she vanished off the face of the earth.

‘But somebody knows where she is. Somebody’s got to know where she is. And we want to know who that person or persons are.’

Jesse 'LJ' Matthew has confirmed he met the 18-year-old in Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall on the night she went missing and bought her drinks at a local bar, MailOnline revealed.

But Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital, told his mother that Hannah did not get into his car and that the pair 'went their separate ways.' 

Matthew’s grandmother, Christine Carr, told MailOnline on Saturday: ‘I have been talking with his mother.

Big break: The local police chief described the find of Matthew as a 'person of interest' as a major break in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham (pictured)

‘He said he went his way and she went hers. He told his mother he bought her some drinks. He said she did not get into his car. The girl went her way and he went his.’

Matthew has lived in Charlottesville his whole life, where he works in the operating room of the UVA Hospital, sources told MailOnline. He is a nursing assistant who transports patients to the operating room.

His grandmother, Mrs Carr, says she instantly recognized her grandson ‘LJ’ when she watched the video tape released by police investigating Hannah’s disappearance.

She told MailOnline: ‘I saw the video tape. That is him, that is LJ. The police went through his car and his apartment.

‘They took away his car and three bags out of his apartment.’

Mrs Carr added she was confident her 32-year-old grandson, who has dreadlocks, has nothing to do with the disappearance of Hannah, who has not been seen since the early hours of last Saturday morning.

‘LJ would never hurt anybody,' Mrs Carr, 82, from Charlottesville, told MailOnline. 'I know he is a good boy. I have known him all his life.

‘I’m sure he had nothing to do with it. He is a good boy. He has worked ever since he was able to work. He has never been in trouble. He would do anything to help anybody.

Chief Lingo added that although police have named Jesse Matthew investigators maintain an open mind to other suspects.

He said: ‘I don’t want to get tunnel vision just because we have a name, just because we saw her with a particular person.’

With friends: Hannah with a group of friends who have all described her disappearance as extremely uncharacteristic

Acquaintances immediately recognized this man as Matthew

However he added people should keep their eyes’ open ‘on all four corners of the nation’ for Matthew.

He said: ‘We were so interested in Jesse Matthew that we found our way to his apartment with a search warrant.’

Chief Longo also issued a photo of his burnt orange Chrysler car.

He said: ‘If you saw that car we want to talk to you. We want to know where you saw it and who was inside the vehicle. If you saw somebody get into that car about 1.20 1.30 we really need to talk to you. Because this is a critical piece of a puzzle with lots of pieces missing.

‘Jesse Matthew showed up at the police station yesterday. He walked straight in through the front door. He got inside and he asked for a lawyer.

‘They walked out of that door and I don’t know any more about that interaction than the minute he walked in.

‘I hope and pray that we might have an opportunity to talk to Jesse Matthew again. Because I think he can help us find Hanna Graham.’

Detective Sergeant Jim Mooney said investigators had received over 900 tips and had spoken to over 75 witnesses..

Mark Eggerman of Virginia Search and Rescue who coordinated the search for Hannah Graham thanked volunteers for giving up their weekend to help find clues.

He said: ‘We need to find that one thing that will turn this mission on a dime.’

Confusion: This map shows Hannah Graham's movements on the night of Friday 12 and Saturday 13. At 11.50pm she was seen at a party by friends with another male friend. She then seemed to head westward toward the Charlottesville downtown mall
