Coleen Rooney couldn't hide her delight from her face as she left hospital on Tuesday after giving birth to her second son Klay Anthony.

The thrilled WAG, 27, smiled at photographers as she led her husband Wayne out of the Liverpool Women's Hospital as he carried their precious newborn in a carrycot.

A short time earlier, their eldest son Kai, three, had left the hospital with his grandparents Colette and Anthony McLoughlin after meeting his new brother.

Growing brood: Wayne Rooney shared a picture of his newly-extended family after wife Coleen gave birth to their second son Klay Anthony 

The mother-of-two wore similar 
clothing to what she had worn when she left the same hospital with Kai 
three years ago - a blazer and leggings - which she teamed with a bright
fuchsia top.

With a wide 
grin on her face, the tired, but happy Coleen was carrying balloons 
presented to her by her parents Colette and Anthony.

A few hours earlier, proud father Wayne shared a picture of his newborn son in the Rooneys' first family photo.

Tired and emotional: Coleen looked worn out but happily posed for pictures with newborn Klay - who looked pretty wide awake already

Precious cargo: Wayne was left to carry baby Klay in a carrycot... and Coleen's Louis Vuitton 'overnight' suitcase

The 27-year-old footballer is seen 
cradling baby Klay Anthony Rooney while three-year-old Kai sits on his 
lap and radiant but tired Coleen, wearing a floral robe, envelops her 
family.

Alongside the image, Wayne wrote: 'My family with our new baby boy Klay.'

The picture came after Wayne announced the birth to his six million followers on Tuesday morning, writing: 'Our Beautiful 
Son Klay Anthony Rooney was born at 2.11am, Weighing 7Ib 11.5 oz. Both
Klay and Coleen are fine..... We're all delighted!!'

Helping hand: One of the hospital staff assisted Coleen and Wayne with their cargo

Glowing: Coleen looked amazing for someone who had given birth hours earlier

Coleen echoed her husband's sentiments by adding: 'At 2.11am our Beautiful Son .... Klay Anthony 
Rooney entered the world. He weighed 7Ib 11.1/2 oz. We're all so happy 
and doing well. X.'

Following
Klay's arrival, an excited Kai was seen arriving at Liverpool Women's 
Hospital on Tuesday morning to meet his new baby brother.

The three-year-old was carrying an 'it's a baby boy' balloon as he walked in with his grandparents Colette and Tony McLoughlin.

Wayne's parents Wayne Snr and Jeanette were also spotted visiting with one of his brothers Graeme.

Celebrities including Coleen's fellow
WAGs Danielle O'Hara, Alex Gerrard and Sheree Murphy, as well as other 
stars including Ed Sheeran and 
Apprentice mogul Lord Sugar were quick to send congratulations.

Among
the family tweets, Coleen's brother Anthony McLoughlin tweeted: 'Made 
up for @ColeenRoo and @WayneRooney ..well done , another nephew to put 
on the naughty step!!'

Claire Rooney, who is Wayne's cousin 
and Coleen's best friend, tweeted: 'Congratulations @ColeenRoo & 
@WayneRooney on the new addition to the family gorgeous baby Klay!! 
Can't wait to meet him! Well done!'

And
cousin Leanne Rooney tweeted: 'Congratulations @ColeenRoo @WayneRooney 
on your beautiful baby boy Klay!! Can't wait to meet him x.'

Fashion
designer Coleen, who revealed over the weekend she had passed her due 
date, was said to have been taken to hospital on Saturday, after 
admitting she had struggled to sleep the night before.

She tweeted: 'Such an uncomfortable sleep last night!!! #hurryupbaby (sic).'

And Coleen admitted during an 
interview in the Daily Mirror earlier this month that she was looking 
forward to having some sleep after giving birth... perhaps forgetting 
the sleepless nights having a newborn can entail.

Another boy: Kai and Colette were joined by his grandfather Tony McLoughlin

She said: 'It’s been really good, but I am looking 
forward to having a good night’s sleep. I have to keep getting up in the
night because I can’t get comfortable.'

The couple announced in December they were expecting a son, two months after confirming Coleen's second pregnancy.

Announcing the baby's sex via Twitter, Coleen wrote: 'Absolutely loved seeing our baby on the scan yesterday!!!

And then there were four: Kai has been preparing to become a big brother for months

'We decided to find out the sex...... It's a ..... BOY!! So exciting @WayneRooney.'

Coleen has previously admitted she 
would love to have a large family, saying: 'I'd like to have maybe three
or four children. I'd be happy to be a full-time mum.'

And Coleen added that Kai was more than a little excited about becoming a big brother.

Making it a double: Wayne announced the good news on his Twitter page in the early hours of Tuesday morning

Happy days: After going into labour late on Saturday night, Coleen was delighted to announce the arrival of her second son

She said: 'He’s
given up on having a brother now and doesn’t believe he’s actually ever
going to arrive. He’s so ready for him to be here now!'

Following in the footsteps of the 
Kardashians, the Rooneys could end up naming their future children with 
names beginning with K, after choosing the monikers Kai and Klay for 
their boys.

Klay - often spelled Clay - is an old English name which means 'mortal'.

Family excitement: The McLoughlins and Rooney were thrilled by the new arrival

Something to occupy Kai: Coleen's father Anthony was carrying a bag of Kai's toys

Visitors: Wayne's mother Jeanette and his brother Graeme leave hospital after visiting the new arrival

Manchester United ace Wayne and Coleen married in Italy in 2008 after a five-year engagement.

The unsettled striker is now expected
to have some downtime with his family before linking up with Roy Hodgson's England squad at the weekend 
ahead of next Wednesday's friendly at Wembley against the Republic of 
Ireland.

Despite 
ongoing issues at United, with his future at Old Trafford still 
uncertain having asked for a transfer, Rooney is in contention to 
captain his country.
