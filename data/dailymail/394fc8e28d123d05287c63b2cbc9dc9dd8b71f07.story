A multi-millionaire businessman who owns a 'chunk' of Laura Ashley and his estranged wife have resumed a High Court battle over money - months after a judge urged them to try to find a resolution.

In July, Mr Justice Bodey called on Khoo Kay Peng, 75, and Pauline Chai, who is in her 60s, to find a solution without doing more damage to themselves after hearing that they had run up legal bills of more than £2million.

But lawyers today returned to court for the latest stage of the divorce cash fight.

The couple disagree over where their fight should be staged. Dr Khoo, who is based in Malaysia, says litigation should take place there. 

Mrs Chai, who lives in England, says it should take place there.

Mr Justice Bodey is expected to make decisions about where litigation should be staged after hearing legal argument from both sides.

Judges have heard that Dr Khoo and Mrs Chai, a former beauty queen, have five grown-up children and were married for more than 40 years.

They have been told that the issue at the centre of the case is how big a payment Dr Khoo will make to Mrs Chai for the part she played in their 42-year 'matrimonial partnership'.

Mrs Chai says her husband is worth more than £400 million and says the amount she should get should run into hundreds of millions of pounds.

In July, Mr Justice Bodey said: 'I urge the parties to use their best endeavours with the help of their legal teams to resolve these extremely expensive proceedings without doing more damage to themselves.'

Earlier this year, another judge described the amounts spent on preliminary legal 'skirmishes' as 'eye-watering'.

Mr Justice Holman said Dr Khoo owned a 'chunk' of Laura Ashley and had properties in England and Malaysia worth more than £50million.

And he said that, on any 'feasible' view, Mrs Chai would get tens of millions of pounds.
