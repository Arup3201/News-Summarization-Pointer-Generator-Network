Shkodran Mustafi, the defender released by David Moyes while at Everton, picked up his third international cap for Germany as a half time substitute against Ghana.

The 22-year-old replaced Jerome Boateng at half time in Germany's 2-2 draw with Ghana but was part of a back four that looked shaky at times - and the former Everton man was outjumped by Andre Ayew for Ghana's first.

Mustafi has been in impressive form for his club Sampdoria and also appeared for the Germans as a substitute in their opener against Portugal

Name: Shkodran MustafiDate of birth: April 17, 1992Place of birth: Bad Hersfeld, GermanyClub: Sampdoria (2012- )Previous clubs: Hamburg (2006-09), Everton (2009-12)

Mustafi was let go on a free transfer by then-Everton manager Moyes after making just one substitute appearance.

After joining Everton from Hamburg in 
2009, centre back Mustafi was a German youth international right through
 his time at Goodison but made his only appearance as a substitute for 
Tony Hibbert in a Europa League tie with BATE Borisov.

Moyes was axed by Manchester United towards the end of last season after a dismal campaign at Old Trafford.

Mustafi, who is of Albanian heritage, was part of the side that won the Under 17 World Cup in 2009.

He has been a vital part of the Sampdoria defence this season, making 31 appearances in Serie A, netting one goal.

Despite strong competition from the likes of Arsenal's Per Mertesacker, Mustafi made it into Joachim Low's final squad and has already made two appearances in Brazil.

Making his mark: Since leaving Everton, Mustafi as played regularly for Sampdoria in Serie A

Through the ranks: Mustafi has been a regular for Germany's youth teams

Heritage: Mustafi is also eligible to play for Albania through his family but looks set to choose Germany
