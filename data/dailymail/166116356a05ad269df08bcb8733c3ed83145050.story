An attorney representing Stephen Collins hit out at the actor’s estranged wife Wednesday, accusing her of trying to blackmail the TV star ahead of their looming divorce trial.

On Tuesday, an audio recording from a 2012 couple's therapy session in which Collins allegedly confessed to exposing himself to three young girls was released to TMZ.

The bombshell claims concerning the actor who played a pastor on the long-running show 7th Heaven set off a firestorm and already cost him roles on the hit drama Scandal and in the upcoming film Ted 2, along with his position on the Screen Actors Guild National Board.

Suspected extortion: The actor's attorney said Grant has tried to blackmail the 7th Heaven star in order to get a bigger share of their assets as part of a future divorce settlement

Attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan pointed a finger of blame at Collins' wife of 27 years, Faye Grant, claiming that she has been threatening to leak the taped confession for years.

‘Over the course of my representation of Stephen in the divorce case, Faye has repeatedly threatened to give this audiotape to the media unless Stephen agreed to pay her millions of dollars more than that to which she was legally entitled,’ he told TMZ.

‘When these demands were rebuffed, Faye attempted -- without success -- to peddle the tape in numerous ways to numerous different people.

‘It appears that she has finally found an audience for this tape -- not surprisingly, on the eve of the trial in the divorce case where, again, she is seeking millions of dollars more than that to which she is legally entitled.’

Grant has denied releasing the tapes to the media, saying that the recordings were supposed to be part of a criminal case.

The estranged wife has filed documents in court listing her and Collins' assets totalling $14million, including more than $5million in property, an art collection worth $40,000, her husband's vintage guitar valued at $100,000, and his $16,000 Rolex.

Grants indicated in the legal papers that she is entitled to half of the assets, but sources close to Collins believe she wants it all.

Bombshell claims: Collins, 67, has been accused of molesting three teenage girls and expressing incestuous thoughts about his unborn child 

New York City police announced Tuesday they have an open investigation into allegations Stephen Collins molested a teenage girl in the early 1970s.

The complaint was filed in 2012 accusing Collins of forcing a then-14-year-old girl to commit a lewd act in the actor's Manhattan apartment in 1972.

An NYPD spokesman said the case remains open and is being handled by Special Victims Division detectives, but no charges have been filed.

Faye Grant wrote in a sworn court declaration in Los Angeles last year that her husband had disclosed he molested at least three young girls, including a relative.

Grant wrote in the November 2012 declaration in the couple's divorce case that she reported abuse to Los Angeles police, who said they are not actively investigating the actor, but could not offer details on any previous investigations

It's all about the money: Sources closed to Collins said his wife is hoping to walk away from their marriage with all of the couple's assets worth $14million 

‘Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long-term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago,’ Grant wrote in the sworn declaration, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in November.

The report to New York police was made six months after Collins filed to divorce Grant, who he married in 1985.

Grant and Collins separated in February 2012, about two weeks after the actress said she learned of her husband's alleged pedophilia in therapy sessions, according to her declaration. Collins filed for divorce three months after the separation.

Grant stated her husband has said two of the girls he molested were abused when they were between the ages of 10 and 14 years old.

She made even more shocking claims about her husband Wednesday, saying he had sexual thoughts about their unborn child while she was pregnant.

She said just before giving birth, Collins told her how glad he was they were having a girl, who they named Kate, instead of a boy who he may have sexually abused.

'The comment you made just before I gave birth to our daughter when you said you hoped we didn't have a little boy, because "you just didn't know if you could keep his little penis out of your mouth" was indication enough that you were sick,' Grant wrote in the email obtained by TMZ.

'I should have followed my gut then, and then again 14 years ago, and kicked your ass to the curb,' she added.

A source close to Collins dismissed the allegations as 'absolutely untrue.'

In the divorce filings obtained by MailOnline, Grant claims her husband used his fame to trick abused children.

'I believe that Stephen used his celebrity status to engender the trust of the families of the children he molested,' Grant wrote. 'I further believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those three girls.

'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.'
