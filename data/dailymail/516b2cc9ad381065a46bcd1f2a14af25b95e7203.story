A Massachusetts State Trooper's heartbreaking letter written just before he took his beloved K9 partner to be put to sleep was shared thousands of times on Facebook in mere hours and shows the inseperable bond of police partners, no matter their species.

In Trooper Christopher Coscia's nine years with German shepherd Dante, he came to see the the dog he calls 'Type A' as the truest of friends, even if he is 'best described as a one-person dog.

'Every morning when I opened the door to his kennel he would jump up on me, wrap his paws around my waist, get his morning greeting and pat from me, storm up the stairs, and push the door open ready to go to work,' he wrote.

The tearful letter was written as Coscia sat in the car not far from where he was supposed to take Dante to be put to sleep on a recent snowy morning after work was cancelled because of snow.

'It all started one day while taking Dante out to his kennel. He collapsed on me, falling like a rock with no control of his body,' Coscia wrote.

Tests revealed that Dante had pulmonary hypertension. His heart was enlarged and he started to suffer seizures due to a loss of blood flow to his brain.

'He had one of these seizures in the yard the other day, and after I sat on the ground in the snow with him patting him calmly waiting for it to be over, I came in the house. Upon walking in, to my dismay, I realized my wife and two children had been intently watching us to make sure all was okay,

'But it wasn’t and when I walked in the door, my wife and daughter were crying, knowing what was to be coming, possibly sooner than we were ready.'

I sit here writing this obituary in a parking lot not two miles before we reached our final destination.

'I
 am glad he made it through the holidays. My wife’s birthday was 
yesterday. I did not want to do that to her; for her to remember her 
birthday as the day we put down Dante would forever bring a tear to her 
eye. Much as it does to me as I write this with every new thought and 
remembrance of my partner, each paragraph brings a new thought and 
anguish for me.'

Even 
as Coscia drove Dante to his final destination, he was unsure of what he
 was doing. He even pulled off the road just to write his letter.

'I
 write this story with tears in my eyes and flowing freely down my 
face,' he wrote. 'Dante is still somehow sitting upright watching me as I
 write about him.'

Coscia
 wrote of how glad he was that Dante lived through the holidays and 
through his wife's recent birthday. But as happy as he was, what he knew
 he had to do was too much for him to bear.

'As
 it does to me as I write this with every new thought and remembrance of
 my partner, each paragraph brings a new thought and anguish for me.'
