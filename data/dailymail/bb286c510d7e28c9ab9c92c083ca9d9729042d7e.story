A primary school has become the first in Britain to ban packed lunches – after concerns that some parents were sending their children with leftover takeaways.

A government inspector called in by the school found that fewer than 1 per cent of its pupils brought packed lunches that were considered healthy.

Under controversial plans, every primary school will have to offer free lunches to all four- to seven-year-olds from September – and the headmaster of All Saints’ primary in Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire, is so horrified by the standard of food some children have been bringing from home that the free lunches will become the only option.

Ban: All Saints' Primary School in Clayton-le-Moors, Lancashire, has banned pupils from bringing in food

But last night parents reacted with 
fury,  branding the decision an intrusion by a ‘nanny state’. One father
 of two said: ‘I think it’s ridiculous and wrong that the school is 
stepping in to act as surrogate parents to our children.

‘It
 is an insult to parents to say that we are unable to feed our children 
properly and it should be against the law to ban freedom of choice. We 
are living in a nanny state which now governs what our children should 
eat.

‘There will be children who go under- nourished because they don’t like what the school has to offer.’

Another
 parent said: ‘I, along with other parents at the school, feel like our 
freedom of choice and liberty in this respect have been taken away from 
us.

'For those parents 
of children with food allergies and intolerances the food choices they 
make for their children are an important factor in their daily lives 
which I can only imagine must be difficult and time consuming.’

But
 another parent welcomed the packed lunch ban, claiming: ‘Some parents 
just give their kids crisps and chocolate for lunch or the remains of 
last night’s takeaway.’

The ban, which comes into force in September, applies to all of the school’s pupils, who are aged between five and seven.

Headmaster Ian Spencer defended the decision, saying only two parents had  complained about it.

Under fire: Nick Clegg has been criticised for forcing schools to offer meals before they have the facilities

He
 was spurred into action after inviting an inspector from  the Food 
Trust Agency to examine a selection of pupils’ packed lunches and 
finding that more than 99 per cent of them did not meet ‘nutritional 
requirements’.

He added: ‘If
 you start making exceptions, that will cause problems as the parents 
whose child is eating meals that are not balanced are going to slip 
through the net.

‘It is 
free and we are catering for diets  and allergies. If they previously 
went to a nursery they would always have to eat what they provide so we 
are not doing anything totally off the planet.

'We
 are trying to provide the very best meals for children and we are 
providing a packed lunch option in school so they can have that or a hot
 meal.’
