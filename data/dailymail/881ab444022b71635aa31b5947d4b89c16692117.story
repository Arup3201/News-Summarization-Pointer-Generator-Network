Adrian stole the show during West Ham United's 9-8 penalty shootout victory over Everton in the FA Cup third round on Tuesday night.

The match finished 2-2 after extra-time before Adrian's shootout heroics - the Spaniard saved Steven Naismith's spot-kick before nervelessly slotting home the winning penalty after Toffees goalkeeper Joel Robles had struck the woodwork.

Amazingly, Adrian was only signed as back-up to Jussi Jaaskelainen at Upton Park in June 2013.

After arriving on a free transfer from Real Betis, the 28-year-old took until the end of 2013 to displace Jaaskelainen as West Ham No 1 - but he has excelled between the sticks since.

Here, Sportsmail looks at the 10 best bargain-buy goalkeepers (costing £1.5million or less) in the history of the Premier League...

Shay Given - £1.5m (Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United)

His career may not have gone quite as planned since leaving Newcastle United, but ask anyone on Tyneside about Shay Given and they will rave about a goalkeeper who was quite simply brilliant for the Magpies - and that despite him having previously turned out for Sunderland during a loan spell.

Then-Toon boss Kenny Dalglish had been so impressed by Given at Blackburn Rovers that he decided to spend a modest £1.5million to bring the Republic of Ireland international to St James' Park in 1997.

In the almost 12 seasons Given spent at Newcastle he kept 91 clean sheets in the Premier League, in spite of the fact he was playing behind a usually dreadful back four, and represented the club in the Champions League, UEFA Cup, as well as the FA Cup final to defeat to Arsenal in 1998.

Peter Schmeichel - £505,000 (Brondy to Manchester United)

When Sir Alex Ferguson describes a transfer as the 'bargain of the century', then you know someone has been a success - and that was exactly what he said about Peter Schmeichel's move from Brondy to Manchester United in 1991.

Although Schmeichel arrived the season before the launch of the Premier League (in 1991), his performances for Man United throughout the 1990s ensure he thoroughly deserves a place on this list having cost just £505,000. With 11 major trophies won during his time at Old Trafford, Schmeichel's period at the club represented one of almost total domestic domination.

The Great Dane kept 113 clean sheets for the Red Devils in the league and, if you include later transfers to Aston Villa (free) and Manchester City (free), he averages a shutout every 0.42 Premier League matches - a quite remarkable record. A player who effectively redefined the role of the goalkeeper.

Joe Hart - £600,000 (Shrewsbury Town to Manchester City)

It is frightening to think that Joe Hart is still only 27 years old due to what he has already achieved in the game.

After arriving at Manchester City from Shrewsbury Town for £600,000 in May 2006, Hart spent time on loan at Tranmere Rovers, Blackpool and Birmingham City before eventually supplanting Given as the Sky Blues' No 1 in 2010-11.

Despite a couple of lapses in form since - leading to him being dropped twice - Hart has amassed 207 Premier League appearances, become England's undisputed first-choice keeper, won four major titles and kept more than 75 clean sheets. Not bad for someone who hasn't even turned 28 yet...

Mark Schwarzer - £1.5m (Bradford City to Middlesbrough)

Mark Schwarzer is now 42 and yet he is still going strong having just moved to Leicester City - his fourth Premier League club after Middlesbrough, Fulham and Chelsea - on a free transfer.

Although a household name now, when the Australian moved to the North East from Bradford City in 1997 for £1.5m he was largely unknown. But Schwarzer would soon establish himself as one of the most consistent goalkeepers in the English top flight.

Schwarzer amassed 93 clean sheets in 366 Premier League matches for Middlesbrough, winning the League Cup with the club in 2004, before excelling at Fulham. A further 56 clean sheets arrived in 172 appearances for the west Londoners - plus he reached the UEFA Cup final with Boro and then the Europa League final with Fulham. Certainly not a bad CV, you know.

Brad Friedel - Free transfer (Liverpool to Blackburn Rovers)

Another goalkeeper who is still plying his trade at the top level at the tender old age of 43, Brad Friedel will go down as one of the great Premier League goalkeepers - both for his sheer longevity and his ability between the posts.

Having played 25 times for Liverpool in the Premier League, the American was allowed to leave Anfield to join up with Blackburn Rovers - then in the First Division - on a free transfer in 2000. A mammoth 77 clean sheets followed in 262 top-flight appearances for Rovers as Friedel regularly helped the Lancashire club fight off the threat of relegation.

Friedel would then move to Aston Villa - where he would play ever single league games over his three seasons in Birmingham - and Tottenham Hotspur, setting a record for the most consecutive Premier League appearances in history (310 matches). An extremely under-rated goalkeeper.

David James - £1.2m (Manchester City to Portsmouth)

With a record 170 clean sheets from 572 Premier League appearances, David James - due to the fact he has played for five different top-flight sides - was always going to make this list.

Having already performed excellently for Liverpool (72 clean sheets), Aston Villa (21), West Ham United (18) and Man City (20), James left the North West for the south coast and signed for Portsmouth for just £1.2m in 2006.

Big-spending Pompey were determined to be successful and recruited an England international who still intended to play on. During his four years at Portsmouth, James added another 39 clean sheets and won an FA Cup. A brilliant signing.

Carlo Cudicini - £300,000 (Castel di Sangro to Chelsea)

Having been recommended to then-Chelsea boss Gianluca Vialli by Lazio goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani, Carlo Cudicini arrived at Stamford Bridge in 1999 for a fee of £300,000.

Although never capped by the Italy national side - largely due to the presence of Gianluigi Buffon - Cudicini eventually overtook Ed de Goey as Chelsea's No 1 goalkeeper. He was even voted the Premier League goalkeeper of the season in 2002-03 during an ITV poll.

However, injury problems that had dogged him during his time at Lazio returned in 2003-04 and, when Jose Mourinho spent big money to bring in Petr Cech in 2004, Cudicini found himself as the best goalkeeper sitting anywhere on the bench in world football. Despite this, Cudicini still managed 142 Premier League appearances during nine years at Stamford Bridge before moving to Tottenham, where he played another 19 top-flight matches.

Jussi Jaaskelainen - £100,000 (Vassan Palloseura to Bolton)

Another old-timer still trying to get back into the first-team picture at West Ham following Adrian's elevation to No 1, Jaaskelainen spent 15 years are Bolton Wanderers before moving to East London.

Having arrived in Lancashire for just £100,000 from Finnish side Vassan Palloseura in 1997, Jaaskelainen went on to keep 89 clean sheets in 379 Premier League matches for Bolton as they finally established themselves as top-flight regulars having endured years as a yo-yo club.

Another 19 clean sheets have followed at Upton Park since his free transfer in June 2012 and, although he is now second choice, Jaaskelainen is still very much trusted by Sam Allardyce.

Thomas Sorensen - £500,000 (Odense BK to Sunderland)

The second Dane on the list, Thomas Sorensen has played for three different Premier League clubs and kept 109 clean sheets - putting him 12th on the all-time Premier League list.

Having joined then-First Division Sunderland from Danish side Odense BK in 1998 for just £500,000, Sorensen established himself as the Black Cats' No 1 and went on to keep 36 clean sheets in 136 top-flight games for the North East club.

A further 46 shutouts have followed as Aston Villa, and most recently at current club Stoke City, with the 38-year-old serving as a worthy deputy to Asmir Begovic at the Britannia Stadium right now.

Tim Krul - £200,000 (ADO Den Haag to Newcastle United)

Newcastle are a club who have made some awful signings down the years, but goalkeepers is one department they almost always seem to get right - and Tim Krul is no exception.

The Dutchman arrived at the club when he was just 17 in 2006 from ADO Den Haag and made an extremely-impressive debut against Palermo in the UEFA Cup that season. Loans to Falkirk and Carlisle United followed so that Krul could gain some first-team experience before he returned to St James' Park in 2009.

With Krul and long-servant Steve Harper battling for first-team duties during Newcastle's season in the Championship, the former eventually gained No 1 status two months into the Magpies' first season back in the top flight in 2010-11. Since then, 37 shutouts have followed in 134 appearances - not to mention his World Cup quarter-final penalty shoot-out heroics for Holland in 2014 - and he has become one of the most sought-after goalkeepers in the Premier League right now.
