Atkinson's experience will help him cope with any pressures, just like I did when Manchester United beat Tottenham 2-1 to win the first part of their historic treble

Martin Atkinson has been entrusted with the game which is expected to see Manchester City confirmed as Premier League champions on Sunday.

The 43-year-old is often seen as the PGMOâ€™s safe pair of hands as he has the experience to cope with any pressures that might come to bear should the game not go as expected.

I remember refereeing the last game of the 1998/99 season at Old Trafford where Manchester United knew if they beat Tottenham they would be crowned champions and secure the first trophy of their historic treble.

Man in the middle: Martin Atkinson will referee Manchester City's home clash against West Ham on Sunday

Tottenham went a goal up and news came through that title rivals Arsenal were winning at Highbury.

It takes strength of mind and character to block out those outside influences and focus on the job in hand.

Atkinson will have to do that at the Etihad and not dwell on any negative thoughts regarding "costing" City the title.

He refereed their recent 2-2 draw with Sunderland and 6-3 home win over Arsenal - either result would suit them this time.

Been there, done that: Graham Poll refereed Manchester United's 2-1 final day win against Tottenham in 1999

End of an era? Phil Dowd (right) could referee his final game when Liverpool host Newcastle on Sunday

Liverpool also have the vastly experienced Phil Dowd on their final game which could be his last top flight appointment.

There is no retirement age any more but as Dowd turns 52 next season he must realise that his active refereeing must come to an end at some point.

Dowd had refereed only one Premier League game at Anfield this season, a 4-0 win against Tottenham.
