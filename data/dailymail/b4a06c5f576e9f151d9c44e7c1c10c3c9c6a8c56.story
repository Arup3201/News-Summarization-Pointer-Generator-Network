Mohamed Dar is on trial at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court accused of stalking two of his neighbours

An Muslim man dressed up like a 'panto' Englishman to taunt his neighbours boasting of his 'joy' over 9/11 and the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby, a court has heard.

Mohamed Dar wore costumes, including a red velvet dinner jacket with a pipe and slippers to taunt his alleged victim, leaving her feeling like she was trapped, 'living in a prison'.

The 52-year-old of Alfreton in Derbyshire has denied stalking Louise Mountford and Daniel Renshaw at Chesterfield Magistrates' Court.

A trial heard Dar also dressed up in an outfit that made him look naked and a red England hat as he tormented residents in his neighbourhood.

Dar harassed Ms Mountford and allegedly spoke of his joy over the 9/11 attack and the murder of Lee Rigby during pretend phone calls.

Giving evidence she told the court: 'He was pretending to be on the phone and was saying how happy he was about the murder of Lee Rigby and how funny he thought it was.

'He has his phone and has conversations to make you hear it. They are always terror-related like 9/11 was the proudest moment of his life and he said he cried with joy.'

Ms Mountford said Dar wrote ‘Free Gaza’ on his house in red spray paint and later wrote ‘Free Palestine’.

She said: 'He dresses up. He knows when you are going out and when you are coming back and tries to get a reaction. It’s like a show he puts on.

'He comes out and goes back to get his hat, pipe and slippers as you’re walking the dog. It’s not very pleasant.

'I put my head down and try to ignore it. I started to go to the police because my daughter is four and is very scared.'

Dar is accused of reveling in the death of drummer Lee Rigby of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers who was attacked and killed in broad daylight 
by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, southeast London

Angela Hadfield, prosecuting, said there have been difficulties with Dar and neighbours going back a significant time.

She
 said: 'Louise Mountford says there has been harassment from Dar. He has
 a better knowledge of her day-to-day routine than she does.

'Whenever she leaves the house and is due to return he knows and as soon as the family leaves, he’s there to harass her.'

'I don't like to go into the garden. I don't like to walk the dog. It's like being in prison'

Ms Hadfield claimed he questioned and measured the height of a new fence Ms Mountford put up for her privacy and allegedly followed her and her family.

Dar also allegedly stood on a wall and stared into her home.

The mother-of-three, said: 'Sometimes he points his binoculars about. It’s a bit of pantomime.'

But she added: 'I don’t like to go into the garden. I don’t walk the dog. It’s like being in prison.'

Firefighter Daniel Renshaw also claims Dar phoned his work and made malicious complaints.

Dar allegedly accused Mr Renshaw of using threatening behaviour against him, but no police action was taken.

The
 defendant reported his neighbour for leaving his car engine running 
after the firefighter had gone to help push another driver’s car.

The court heard Dar would pretend to be on the phone, telling of his 'joy' over the deaths of nearly 3,000 people when the Twin Towers in New York collapsed on September 11, 2001

Mr Renshaw also claims Dar falsely complained to the fire service that he had made racist, monkey chants.

He said: 'He follows me to work. He uses his background and religion to say I have made racial comments. It was a very stressful time.'

Defending his client Denny Lau, argued Ms Mountford disliked Dar and implied he used his binoculars for star-gazing and that waving and saying hello was normal.

Mr Lau argued Dar’s praying was part of his religion.

Dar, who has yet to give evidence, denies stalking Ms Mountford between September 22, and November 13, 2013. He also denies stalking Mr Renshaw between June 3, 2013, and October 31, 2013.

The trial was adjourned until May 12.
