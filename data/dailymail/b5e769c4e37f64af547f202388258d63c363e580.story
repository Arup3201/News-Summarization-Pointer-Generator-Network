Tornado
 warnings urging residents to seek cover immediately in parts of 
northern Oklahoma were issued on Thursday, raising concern about another
 powerful storm after a twister in the area killed 24 people and injured
 more than 300 last week.

The National Weather Service has already reported a tornado touched the ground during the afternoon near the town of Perkins in northeast Oklahoma.

A second tornado from the same storm system was reported near Ripley. Both twisters were in rural areas and didn't seem to cause significant damage.

'Take cover if you are in the path!!' the weather service tweeted just before the tornadoes formed.

One of the tornado warnings issued was for Cushing, 
Oklahoma, which is a critical hub for the U.S. oil markets and home to 
over 65 million barrels of crude oil storage.

Perkins Emergency Management Director Travis Majors said there were no 
injuries or damage there. Ripley, about 10 miles east of Perkins, did 
not seem to have significant damage. The Payne County emergency 
management director did not immediately return a phone call seeking 
comment.

Thursday's tornadoes were much less dangerous than the EF5 storm that 
struck Moore, Okla., on May 20 and killed 24 along its 17-mile path. The
 U.S. averages storms of that nature — with winds over 200 mph — only 
about once per year. The Moore storm was the nation's first EF5 tornado 
since 2011.

The warnings were put in effect for parts of several counties north of Oklahoma City, according to Corey Mead, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.

'It looks like it is going to be an active severe weather day,' Mead said. 'The Oklahoma City area is definitely at risk of tornadoes.'

In addition to tornadoes, the storms bring rain and hail.

'Right now we've been getting a few thunderstorms, but they're very 
severe supercell thunderstorms,' said Michael Scotten, a meteorologist 
with the National Weather Services.

'The whole storm rotates, and they 
produce on occasion some tornadoes and heavy hail.'

Severe weather is forecast for a large area of the central United States extending from north of Dallas, Texas all the way to near the Canadian border in Wisconsin, according to a National Weather Service map.

Oklahoma City's KFOR television showed video of a dark cloud a few miles from Cushing, which is the delivery point for the U.S. oil industry. Oil traders were closely watching the storm for any sign of damage to infrastructure.

Tornado warnings were also in effect on Thursday in parts other parts of Oklahoma and the state of Arkansas. The storms are also capable of producing 3-inch hail.

At least one injury was reported when a home was hit in rural western Arkansas.

Arkansas Emergency Management spokesman Tommy Jackson said first 
responders were having trouble reaching the destroyed home because a 
number of trees were blocking the road.

Montgomery County Sheriff's 
spokeswoman Brandy Wingfield said there was property damage, including 
downed power lines, in the area.

'Right now we've been getting a few thunderstorms, but they're very severe supercell thunderstorms,' said Michael Scotten, a meteorologist with the National Weather Services.

'The whole storm rotates, and they produce on occasion some tornadoes and heavy hail.'

Scotten said the severe weather threat would continue over parts of Oklahoma until 10 p.m. Thursday evening.

CBS News meteorologist David Bernard reported Thursday morning the Great Plains area already saw 75 tornadoes since Sunday.

Severe weather was also possible in other parts of the central United states, including parts of Kansas Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
