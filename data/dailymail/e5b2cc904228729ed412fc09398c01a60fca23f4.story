A man who recently penned a self-help book on how to lead a happy life has given away virtually everything he owned.

Over the course of just a few hours on Saturday, Brian Bagnall from Chicago held a garage sale like no other.

Mr Bangnall, 32, of Franklin Park, gave everything away for free to punters who stopped by as he prepares to move to a fully furnished home in Virginia.

Nothing left but the clothes he's wearing: Brian Bagnall decide to give away all his worldly possessions for free. But don't worry, he's just written a book on how to be happy which he is hoping will become a best seller

Free-for-all: People sift through Brian Bagnall's home as he offered up his belongings for free to help spread happiness and the holiday spirit

Lining up: Brian Bagnall gave away everything in his home aside from a few personal items as he prepared for a move to a furnished home in Virginia.

Brian Bagnall & Tiffany Brunelli: Brian says it was his girlfriends' idea to sell everything. The couple are moving to a full furnished house in Virginia. Tiffany was also editor on Brian's latest book

He know's what he's doing: Brian Bagnall just wrote the book on how to be happy which includes learning to live a simpler life with fewer possessions

Instead of selling his belongings, Mr Bagnall posted on Craigslist that he was giving things away.

'After seeing the many videos of people acting crazy on Black Friday, we wanted to encourage some human kindness,' the Craigslist ad read.

'We thought about selling it, but that just wouldn’t be in the holiday spirit.'

Brian’s girlfriend Tiffany came up with the idea.

'Brian had written a book and I was actually the editor for it and just reading the book just really makes you think about what you have and how you can help other people and basically what you put out comes around six-fold,' she told CBS News.

In exchange for the free stuff, potential purchasers had to stick to a few rules.

Mr Bagnall asked that no one push, shove, run, yell or do any other mean acts during the giveaway.

'This isn’t Walmart,' the ad said.

Roughly 200 people showed up on Saturday morning to clean out his three-bedroom home and within a few hours, the place was almost empty.

'People
 were waiting all over the lawn and cars were lining up and down the 
street,' Mr Bagnall said. 'There were 40 or 50 people on the front lawn 
when it first opened.'

Mr 
Bagnall said the sale was part of his plan to live 
the life he preaches, although some have suggested the entire sale was 
merely a publicity stunt to generate some much-needed interest in his 
new self-help book 'The Happiness Bible', which came out less than a 
month ago.

One big clearout: Instead of selling his belongings, Bagnall posted on Craigslist that he was giving away his things for free. After seeing the many videos of people acting crazy on Black Friday, we wanted to encourage some human kindness

People who saw an ad on Craigslist thought it was too good to be true: A house full of possessions, free for the taking. But it was true and about fifty people showed up Saturday morning and cleared the place out

Dash and grab: People made off with whatever they could lay their hands on. here a woman (left) takes away some chairs ans a bag. The minivan in the background is taking away Brian's mattress and some chairs too!

A number of high-end items were ready for the taking including a Sealy Posturepedic Queen Mattress, a Flexsteel couch and loveseat Set, lamps, a desk, bookcases and even DVD players and garden furniture.

It would appear that if his book doesn't sell, Mr Bagnall will truly be left with nothing after giving away everything from couches and love seats to tools and ladders. He said people were even taking shelves off the walls.

A man identifying himself as Ramasomie, said, 'This is a great thing. A lot of people need stuff to start their life with and he’s doing a great job. We’re very thankful for that.'

'There were a lot of smiles today,' Mr Bagnall said at the end of the day. 'People need happiness more than ever right now and Black Friday shows it.'

The author's mantra is to try and do little things each day to spread happiness, such as buying a coffee for the person in line behind them when they go out.
