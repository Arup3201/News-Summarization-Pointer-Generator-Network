A dive-bombing blackbird has made life a misery for visitors to one of America's most popular parks by launching ferocious airborne attacks.

The bird has been spotted swooping down on families - including children - and pecking them on the head near Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, US.

Mila Zinkoea captured the vicious attack on camera when she was pecked on the bonce by the winged menace in a scene straight out of Alfred Hitchcock's horror movie The Birds.

After moving to a safe spot, she started filming and singled out one bird in particular who was the main aggressor.

She said: 'It was circling its nest. There were dozens of nests around, but only this one bird kept attacking people.'

The angry bird can be seen dive-bombing people as they walk beside a hedge where its chicks sit in a nest.

It does not discriminate between blondes or brunettes or the young and the old, attacking anyone who comes within its vicinity.

And incredibly, Ms Zinkoea said she saw tourists who were antagonising the bird.

She said: 'I observed one Chinese couple who were violently shaking the bush with the nest on it in order to make the bird to attack them in order to take a picture.' 

The news comes after a spate of crow attacks on blonde women jogging in Eltham Park in London.
