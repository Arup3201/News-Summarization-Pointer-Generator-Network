Labour leader Ed Miliband will use a speech today to set out how he plans to tackle the country's vast deficit

Ed Miliband's bid to restore Labour's battered economic credibility backfired spectacularly last night.

He pledged that reducing the deficit would be a priority if he wins the election but independent experts warned his plans would mean 'much more borrowing and debt'.

The Labour leader – who forgot to mention the deficit in his party conference speech this year and has spent the past four years attacking Tory cuts – refused to say how and where he would reduce spending.

Mr Miliband claimed Labour would impose 'year on year' spending cuts to reduce the deficit, saying it was his 'first pledge of the election campaign'.

And he admitted that being seen to deal with the huge budget deficit left by the last Labour government was now 'an essential test of credibility' for the party, which lags far behind the Conservatives on the issue in opinion polls.

Mr Miliband pledged to bring day-to-day government spending back into balance 'as soon as possible'.

But he gave no date for bringing the public finances back into the black – suggesting that Britain's towering debts would continue to rise indefinitely under Labour. 

And though he said Labour was working on plans for 'common sense spending reductions', he refused to spell out where the axe would fall, saying the full detail would be released only after a Labour victory in next May's General Election.

Experts warned that his lax rules on public finances would rack up gigantic debts for future generations. 

Labour would continue to borrow for capital spending on things such as transport infrastructure, which is forecast to hit £27billion by 2020. 

And Mr Miliband rejected Mr Osborne's target of running a £23billion budget surplus that year, potentially allowing him an extra £50billion in spending and borrowing by 2020.

Advertising firm Clear Channel today tweeted this picture of the billboard using the slogan which Mr Miliband was challenged to come up with this morning

When your opponents are threatening to outspend you ahead of the election, you'd be happy with any free publicity.

But Ed Miliband could not have predicted he would see his name up in neon lights in Piccadilly Circus after bungling an attempt to come up with a snappy campaign slogan.

The Labour leader was asked by Andrew Morley, the chief executive of advertising firm Clear Channel, to failed to sum up his message to voters in eight words. He came up with 10.

They were: 'A country that works for you, not the privileged few.'

But five hours later the slogan, together with a picture of Mr Miliband, was emblazoned across the world famous screens of Piccadilly Circus, witness by tourists, office workers and passing taxis.

A spokesman for the firm said: 'We took the decision to provide the space free of charge following a humorous exchange between our chief executive Andrew Morley and Mr Miliband earlier in the day.

Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said Mr Miliband and his Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls had left themselves 'a lot of wiggle room' to let them get away with spending cuts that were 'very shallow indeed'.

Mr Emmerson told Radio 4's The World At One: 'You would get much, much less spending cuts potentially under a Labour government but you'd have much more borrowing and therefore more government debt.'

George Osborne warned that Labour's plans would mean 'economic chaos'. 

Public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018-19, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecasts of spending cuts

Under the latest forecasts, the deficit will fall from £91billion this year to put the country in surplus by 2018-19, but Labour has promised to only reach that point by 2020

Lord Mandelson said the rise of parties like Ukip was due to the failure of mainstream politicians

Labour was part of an elite that helped 'screw up' the economy, Lord Mandelson admitted yesterday.

The former business secretary said the rise of parties like Ukip in the West was partly due to the failure of mainstream politicians and institutions to prevent the financial crash.

He suggested the last Labour government, in which he played a leading role, was among those that had failed on the issue.

Speaking to the Institute for Public Policy Research in London yesterday, Lord Mandelson said: 'So many voters have turned outwards from the mainstream because they think those of us in the mainstream have screwed it up – and arguably we did.

'The financial crisis, and the crisis in the banks and sovereign debt – they were man-made.

'I'm not saying it was made in Europe, but the fact is we didn't have enough strength in our systems and structures to enable us to deal with the impact of the crisis.

'So we did screw up – the whole political, business and financial elite of the Western world – and you can't blame people for saying so.'

In a separate interview with Prospect magazine, Lord Mandelson suggested Britain was heading for another hung parliament after next year's election.

He said a Tory majority appeared impossible, but suggested an outright win for Labour under Ed Miliband 'also looks less likely'. 

The Chancellor said Mr Miliband and his party 'created the deficit and by delaying paying off the deficit what he's really telling the British people is that he would borrow more and put up taxes'.

Mr Miliband claimed the Conservatives were proposing 'extreme' cuts. He pointed to official forecasts suggesting that, under Tory plans, the size of the state will shrink to its lowest level since the mid-1930s.

But Mr Emmerson said the comparison was misleading. 'The size of the government as measured as a share of national income would indeed be back to the level last seen in the late 1930s,' he said. 'But that is not to say that living standards would be anything like they were in the 1930s. 

Our GDP is substantially higher than that, and therefore the amount we have to spend on our private consumption, on our public services in real terms is significantly higher.'

Mr Miliband said Labour had already spelled out some modest cuts, such as ending the winter fuel allowance for better-off pensioners, as well as proposing new taxes, such as a mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million.

Labour announced yesterday that it would also save more than £500million a year from local government budgets by cutting bureaucracy, scrapping a Coalition scheme to boost house building and considering mergers of fire and rescue services. 

But the savings identified so far pale in comparison with Britain's £91billion annual deficit.

The Labour leader also claimed that Britain's 'cost of living crisis' was holding back the recovery – just as official figures showed that Britain's standard of living has risen to be the fourth highest in the EU.

The Eurostat figures suggest the UK has overtaken the Netherlands and is well ahead of France, Italy and Spain, with a standard of living 15 per cent above the EU average.

Only Luxembourg, Germany and Austria are ahead of the UK.

n Mr Miliband came unstuck yesterday when an advertising executive asked him to devise a short election slogan. 

Told it should be no more than eight words – and despite counting on his fingers – he came up with the effort 'A country that works for you, not the privileged few' – a ten-word slogan.
