Out and about: Laura Johnson heads to the gym

Last summer, millionaire’s daughter Laura Johnson was behind bars for her role as a getaway driver in one of the most serious rampages of the London riots.

A year on and the former grammar school prefect seems to be making the most of her freedom, appearing relaxed as she prepared to get behind the wheel of a car and head to the gym.

It is a far cry from two years ago when she became 'infatuated' with convicted robber and ‘bad boy’ Emmanuel Okubote, 20.

Her trial last May heard how she had shunned her respectable background to embrace an ‘exciting new world’ of cannabis, alcohol and violent gangster rap music.

This included acting as a driver for Okubote and his friends as they embarked on a seven-hour crime spree during the riots that scarred the summer of 2011.

Straight-A student Miss Johnson, 21, was found guilty of burglary and handling stolen goods and jailed for two years.

During sentencing, Judge Patricia Lees told her: ‘You were pivotal to this planned criminal enterprise.

‘You drove to pick up the rest of the group and willingly remained with them throughout.

‘On your evidence so much was stolen throughout that night it necessitated trips to safe addresses where goods could be off-loaded.’

She served just seven months in prison before she was released on licence.

Miss Johnson, who is not believed to be working at the moment, lives with her parents Robert and Lindsay, who own a direct marketing business, and her two brothers, at the family’s £1million home, in Orpington, Kent.

Mrs Johnson declined to comment on her daughter’s release from prison.

Laura Johnson leaves Inner London Crown Court on March 26 last year. Following a trial in May 2012 she was found guilty of burglary and handling stolen goods and jailed for two years
