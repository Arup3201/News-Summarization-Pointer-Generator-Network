A cash-strapped council has been criticised for handing a rugby team at least £750 for a weekend jaunt to the south of France.

It is thought officials in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, have been offering the £50-a-head subsidy for several years despite savage budget cuts.

The biennial tour sees players take a 24-hour bus ride to their twin town of Bron, where they enjoy 'festivities' before a match against Bron's rugby club.

The grants were exposed this week and came despite North Lanarkshire Council axing 700 staff over three years to meet £62million of budget cuts.

The total handed to the club is likely to be higher than £750 (one grant per player), as council officials were unable to say what amounts were given out in previous years.

Rugby club president Jim Cochrane insisted the cash, which is for travel expenses only, showed the council's commitment to Cumbernauld.

But the handouts were criticised by an Scottish National Party councillor and a taxpayers' campaign group.

Eben Wilson, of Taxpayer-Scotland, said: 'Rugby clubs are private organisations and should survive or fail on their own efforts.

'It's not a good idea to start subsidising them, because there is no end to the number of people who might want support.

'Taxpayers want their taxes spent on public services, not private trips.'

North Lanarkshire councillor Tommy Cochrane, from the SNP, added: 'We need to find exactly where this money is being sourced from.

'All council spending should be focused locally rather than being taken out of the region.

'If the council is having to make cuts, then we should be very careful where we're spending money.'

Cumbernauld RFC began making the 1,000-mile in 1983 and the tours have been a tradition since then.

The Scottish and French clubs alternate who hosts the matches, playing an away match in one year and a home match in the next.

The club's president Jim Cochrane insisted the council's support showed its commitment to the town.

'The council have been supporting us for years,' he said.

'I'll be the first to admit that I was surprised, in these days of cuts, that they were still able to offer the money.

'It is absolutely great of them, and shows that they haven't lost sight of the strong links between two sporting organisations and value what the club are doing in maintaining these links.'

A council spokesperson added: 'Cumbernauld has a long standing twinning agreement with Bron and we are proud of the education, business and sporting links.

'Since 1983 annual exchange visits have taken place between the Cumbernauld and Bron Rugby clubs.

'The council is happy to support this and offers £50 to each participant from Cumbernauld to assist with their travelling expenses.'
