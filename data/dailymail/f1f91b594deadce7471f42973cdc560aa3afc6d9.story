When Lauren George was shot in the head outside her apartment building in Alabama earlier this year, no one thought she would make it.

Five months later, the 20-year-old who has survived against overwhelming odds is learning to speak and walk again.

'I'm glad I'm here, that I'm alive, even though it's been hard,' George said in her halting voice.

Devastating injuries: A bullet shattered the right side of Lauren's skull, leaving her with two brain injuries

Lauren's world was turned upside down at around 10.30pm on January 20 when a stray bullet struck her in the head in the parking lot of the Falcon Mano apartment on Overton Road in Montevallo.

Shots rang around a short time after a pair of armed men came to the apartment building with the alleged intent to commit a robbery, the station WBRC reported.

Lauren George was rushed in critical condition to University of Alabama Hospital, where she spent a few days in a coma before she finally opened her eyes and called for her parents.

The 20-year-year former veterinary clinic worker suffered two brain injuries when the bullet shattered the left side of her skull.

Nearly six months after the shooting, Ms George still has swelling in her brain. Eventually, she will have to undergo surgery to replace a part of her damaged skull.

Setback: Lauren's doctors recently have found blood clots in her lungs and legs

For Lauren and her parents, her recovery has been an uphill battle punctuated by setbacks. Recently, Lauren’s doctors have discovered blood clots in her legs and lungs.

Her speech is still slow and she moves around the house with a walker, but Lauren and her mother, Kameron George, are certain that she will come out on the other side stronger than ever.

‘Because God had more than one opportunity to take her if he wanted her,’ the mother said. ‘If she gets no better than she is now we are so lucky. She is so lucky.’

On her part, Lauren George said she 'shouldn't have survived,' and that the only reason she is still among the living is because she has a greater purpose in life.

The two suspects in the shooting that nearly ended Ms George’s life, Terry Searcy and Kevin Gutiérrez, both 18 years old, have been charged with first-degree robbery and assault.

According to a witness account, Lauren got into an argument with one of the suspect before she was shot in the head.

Her mother said this week that no prison time for the alleged robbers would satisfy their family. 

'Because of the life-altering events that have taken place, their punishment can never be enough for what we've endured and what we will still endure,’ she said.
