It began with the cruel taunts of a gang of youngsters. And it ended with a trail of destruction estimated at costing £260,000.

Coach driver Colin Scott, 52, ‘lost his mind’ after children in the street jeered at him, calling him a ‘fat b******’, making V-signs at him, and shouting: ‘How fat is your wife?’

He began swerving his vehicle at them to try to frighten them off.

Crash: Colin Scott, 52, 'lost his mind' and slammed into cars and buildings after children on the street called him a 'fat b******', made V-signs and shouted 'how fat is your wife?'

But his final swerve was too violent and he lost control of the bus, causing a six car pile-up and demolishing buildings.

Scott was disqualified from driving for three years, ordered him to pay £500 costs and to do 200 hours of unpaid work

Mercifully there were no serious injuries in the crash, which happened in busy bank holiday traffic on a  narrow high street.

A court heard Scott lost his temper after children on a bus in front of 
his coach stuck out their tongues and made V signs at him.

CCTV footage showed the group of a dozen children, aged between 11 and 
14, getting off the bus at a stop and continuing to abuse Scott, calling
 him a ‘fat b******’.

Initially, he reacted by returning  V-signs to the youngsters, who were 
running alongside his coach, but he became angry when they shouted ‘how 
fat is your wife?’.

Scott aggressively swerved his coach at the children a number of times 
to give them a warning, but they continued to mock him. On the final 
swerve, the coach, carrying five John Lewis staff on a training day, 
careered into oncoming traffic.

In a statement read at Croydon Crown Court, John Lewis employee Nick 
Henderson said: ‘He only stopped when a road sign came through the 
windscreen.

‘He had snapped and lost his mind. He was blaming everyone but himself, but I blame him.’
Scott, of Reading, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving on Carshalton High Street, Sutton, South London, on August 27, 2010.

He was disqualified from driving  for three years, ordered to pay  costs of £500 and to do 200 hours of unpaid work.
Kathy Hirst, defending, said: ‘Mr Scott has an unblemished record as  a coach driver of ten years. He  simply lost control.’

Pile-up: Scott lurched towards them and lost control of his vehicle in Carshalton High Street, Sutton, south London, causing £260,000 of damage to cars and to three buildings, on August 27, 2010
