Surrounded by breath taking landscapes, these incredible selection of photographs show some of the most beautiful golf courses ever created.

Captured from the ground and from the air, these images were taken by professional golf course photographer, Evan Schiller, 53, using lifts, helicopters and even drones to get the perfect shot.

Taken anywhere from the scenic coast of Scotland to the palm tree-filled greens of Hawaii, Evan has visited courses from all around the world.

With over 20 years of experience photographing golf courses, Evan has snapped some of the world's most prestigious courses, such as Pebble Beach Golf Links, California, Augusta National Golf Club, Georgia, USA, The Old Course at St. Andrews, Scotland and the Royal County Down, Ireland.

Incredibly, Evan was actually a former PGA golfer and has since been able to combine his talents as a photographer to show each course in all their glory.

Evan said: 'My time as golfer has taken me to some amazing places over the years, so one day I thought: 'I must get a camera'.

'My background in golf really helps my photography, I've been around it all my life and it gives me the ability to see the course in different and unique ways.

'I think my favourite ever course must be the Royal County Down in Ireland, it's so beautiful there and it's always a pleasure to both play on the course and photograph it.

'One of the most stand out moments in my career as a golf course photographer was when I saw two, huge bull moose fighting.

'I was at the top of a ladder at the time, waiting for the wind to stop when I heard a clanking sound behind me, I couldn't believe they were going at right in front of me.

'My mother gave me a camera as a child and I would take pictures of all the beautiful locations I visited, one day my friend mentioned the idea that I should sell them and it went from there.'
