An eight-year-old boy drowned after a lifeguard stopped watching swimmers to chat to a customer, a court heard.

Kelly Woods, 31, had been talking for up to 15 minutes when Suraj Mall got into difficulty.

When she turned back to watch the swimming pool, the youngster was found floating face down.

Woods, who is charged with failing to
properly supervise pool users, dived in to try to save him, but  the 
schoolboy had already been submerged for almost two minutes. Despite 
attempts to revive him, Suraj was pronounced dead in hospital.

‘She was at work and got talking to a
customer while she was on duty,’ James Puzey, prosecuting, told the 
court. ‘A few minutes later a boy – Suraj Mall – was found floating face
down in the water.’

The youngster’s mother, who had taken
Suraj and his three siblings to the pool, broke down in the witness 
stand as she recalled the tragedy which happened in February 2008.

Lajla Kaur, 35, went for a brief 
induction at the centre’s gym and returned to see her four children in 
the pool’s shallow end through a glass window. She then went to get 
change for a locker and on returning couldn’t see her son.

She said: ‘Suraj wasn’t there and I kind of panicked.

‘When I got the children’s attention 
they couldn’t hear me through the glass. When they did finally 
understand they pointed towards the changing room.

‘Then I heard the alarm and people were coming out of the pool.’

Wolverhampton Swimming and Fitness 
Centre lifeguard Natalie Emery, 24, told jurors that conversations with 
customers of more than two minutes were not permissible.

Jurors heard that five lifeguards were on duty that day, and from the man Woods was talking to, Barry King

Lifeguards took half-hour shifts 
overseeing one area of the centre and the most recent changeover had 
occurred at 4.30pm – 19 minutes before a 999 call was made about the 
drowning.

Miss Emery said: ‘I noticed Kelly was talking to a gentleman. It was for between ten and 15 minutes.’

But customer Barry King said he and Woods, from Tettenhall Wood, West Midlands, were talking for just ‘a couple of minutes’.

He said he went over to chat to Woods
about a previous incident in which he had been told the shorts he wore 
were too long to swim in.

He added: ‘She was concentrating on her job and I don’t think I distracted her.’

Mr Puzey told Wolverhampton Crown 
Court: ‘This defendant was a lifeguard and her job was to look after 
people who came to swim at the public pool.

‘Customers are at risk if the 
lifeguard allows themselves to become distracted. It is fundamental to 
what they do that their whole attention must be focused on the pool.’

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
