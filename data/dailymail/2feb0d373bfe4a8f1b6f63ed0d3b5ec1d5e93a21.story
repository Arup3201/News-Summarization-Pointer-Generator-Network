Nikica Jelavic has sensationally announced he is quitting the Croatian national team. 

The Hull striker was left out of his country's starting line-up for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia on Friday. 

Croatia won 1-0 thanks to an own goal from Nikolay Bodurov, starting with Mario Mandzukic and Ivica Olic up front.

Nikica Jelavic has scored six international goals, including this one in June against Australia 

The 29-year-old starred at the World Cup where he forced an own goal against hosts Brazil 

In the absence of Jelavic Croatia beat Bulgaria 1-0 in their latest Euro 2016 qualifier 

But Jelavic shocked Croatia coach Niko Kovac by announcing his desire to retire from international football and the manager wished him well for the future.  

Kovac said: 'I thank him for everything he has done for the Croatian national team. 

'I wish him the best in his life and his club football career.'

The 29-year-old has played 36 games for Croatia, scoring just 6 goals. 

He appeared for his country in Euro 2012 and this summer's World Cup, scoring against the Republic of Ireland in the former.  

Before joining Hull in January, Jelavic played for Hajduk Split, Rangers and Everton.

The striker can now concentrate on his club football with Hull, which will delight boss Steve Bruce  

Jelavic has scored eight goals since joining Hull from Everton in January
