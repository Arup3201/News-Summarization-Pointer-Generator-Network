When it was announced the G20 leaders' meeting would be coming to Australia, those living in Brisbane were assured the summit would be no interruption to their daily lives.

However, video shot on Tuesday showing a US aircraft whipping up an almighty dust cloud which engulfs a highway suggests otherwise.

The footage shows a two tilt-rotor Osprey aircraft practicing a landing near the busy Inner City Bypass in Brisbane when it hits an unexpected spot of trouble.

During a drill on Tuesday ahead of G20 this weekend US aircraft caused dramas when it whipped up a huge dust cloud

At first the aircraft appeared to be simply completing normal practice

The plume of red dust stirred up as the The United States Marine Corps (USMC) aircraft got closer to the ground stopped motorists driving along the six-lane strip in their tracks as the massive cloud spread.

At first the dust cloud covered only a small amount of space around the aircraft itself, but less than 30 seconds later it has completely engulfed the surrounding area. 

ABC Radio National presenter  Rhianna Patrick described the planes to the ABC as 'celebrities' of the aircraft world and revealed they are not often spotted Down Under.

However as the Osprey started its descent it stirred up a huge red dust cloud

The dust spread across the road and onto the busy Inner City Bypass in Brisbane

At one stage it engulfed the motorway making it near impossible for drivers to see 

'We all know these aircraft purely through cinema, through news, they are like the celebrities of the aviation world,' the keen plane spotter said.

'Air Force One is probably the most recognised aircraft in the world, closely followed by Marine One, which is what the Sea King helicopter is called when it is carrying the president,' Ms Patrick continued.

It's not the first air power that's been spotted flexing its muscles at Victoria Park Gold Club at Herston leading up to the G20.

All of the world leaders have brought aircraft to Australia with them, however the American planes are arguably the most impressive.
