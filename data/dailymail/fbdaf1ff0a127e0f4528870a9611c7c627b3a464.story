Senator Nova Peris has shared a photo of a vile racist letter sent to her at her Parliament House office in Canberra this week.

The address on the front of the letter labelled the Northern Territory Senator a 'dirty black a**o' - a derogatory term for Aborigines - and a 'corrupt liar'. 

Ms Peris posted the picture of the letter to her Facebook page with the caption: 'Today's mail. Only makes me work harder! Thanks to all who have sent their support.'

Ms Peris posted a picture of a racist letter she received to her Facebook page with the caption 'Today's mail. Only makes me work harder! Thanks to all who have sent their support.'

This comes less than two weeks after a Northern Territory News story published a string of her emails, raising accusations she used taxpayer money to facilitate an extra-marital affair with  sprinter Ato Boldon

Ms Peris told Daily Mail Australia she usually receives a racist letter once every few weeks, but said she had been 'inundated' in the past two weeks following a Northern Territory News story that published a string of emails between her and Trinidad and Tobago sprinter Ato Boldon.

The story raised accusations she used taxpayer money to facilitate an extra-marital affair with Mr Boldon, but Ms Peris defended herself against the charges during an address to the Federal Senate last month.

The senator said the emails were leaked as part of a long-running family dispute and the accusations about her misusing taxpayer funds were 'baseless'.

Australia's first female indigenous senator told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that she has been on the receiving end of racism her entire life.

'As a woman, an Aboriginal and a Labor politician I am a beacon for extreme right wing hatred,' Ms Peris said.

'I published the envelope because all Australians need to understand that this sort of racism is alive in this country and to remind a small select group out there that I won't allow them to discourage me or bring me down.' 

Ms Peris said she opened the letter but 'the contents are far too vulgar and steeped in hatred to bear repeating.'

More than 800 people commented on Senator Peris's Facebook post on Monday, with many labelling the sender of the racist letter 'disgusting', 'spineless' and a 'coward'.

'What a trashy low life scumbag this person is I hope you reported it and the cops charge them Nova,' wrote Gayle Head.

'How sad and disgusting that here we are in 2014 and Indigenous Australians are still subjected to this sort of abuse. This behaviour and attitude is wrong. It was always wrong and it will always be wrong. All Australians should be disgusted by it. Stand tall Senator Peris,' posted Ali Gibbs.

Meanwhile Dame-Lindy Sparrow wrote: 'Wow. Good on you Nova for posting it. It's good to shine the light on racism. By making this public you have taken the upper hand and the response from the people posting on this page shows that the writer is way out of touch with most Australians.'

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms Peris for comment.

An Australia Post spokeswoman said the postal service makes 'every reasonable effort' to prevent offensive items being transported through their network.

'Regrettably due to large volumes and the complex nature of our business we may be unable to intercept all offensive items,' she said.

'We have alerted our delivery staff to this issue and encourage any customers who receive offensive items to report it directly to the police in the first instance.'
