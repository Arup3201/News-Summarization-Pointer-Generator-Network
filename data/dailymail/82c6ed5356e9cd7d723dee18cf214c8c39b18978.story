Police at the scene of the shooting in Welling, south east London, where a police officer was shot in the hand by a drink driving suspect 

The incident occured last night at 9.10pm when police were called to reports of a car having crashed into a number of cars and then a lamppost in Welling.

The suspected driver of the car was then seen to walk away from the scene and a short time later was stopped by two officers from Bexley.

The man is alleged to have then pulled out the gun, shooting it, with the officer who was not hit detaining the suspect.

He was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and drink driving and remains in custody.

The weapon and ammunition was recovered at the scene and the two officers have been provided with welfare support by the Metropolitan Police.

Officers from Trident returned to the scene today to look for clues as they continue to investigate the incident 

Borough Commander of Bexley Peter Ayling said: 'Last night's incident highlights the dangers that police officers can face as they go about their job.

'My officers, knowing they were faced with a man in possession of a firearm, did not shirk from their duty to protect Londoners.

'They bravely confronted this man, disarmed him and arrested him - I cannot praise their courage enough.'

Police say that enquiries are continuing with officers from Trident continuing to investigate.

Anyone who witnessed the incidents is asked to contact police on 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
