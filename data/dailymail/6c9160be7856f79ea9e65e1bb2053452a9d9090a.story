Hearing the sound of birdsong and listening to music is something most of us take for granted, but around one in every 1,000 babies is born deaf and many people lose their hearing as they get older.

Cochlear implants have revolutionised life for people who are deaf or hearing impaired and cannot benefit from a hearing aid. But until recently, the experts who design and implant the devices have not known what they sound like.

Now, scientists have revealed what it sounds like to hear via an implant.

The cochlear implant is a surgically placed under the skin behind the ear and includes microphones to pick up sounds and a speech processor to prioritise audible speech externally - splitting the sound into channels and sending the electrical sound signals though a thin cable to the transmitter.

The transmitter is a coil held in position by a magnet placed behind the external ear that transmits power and the processed sound signals across the skin to the internal device by electromagnetic induction.

A receiver and stimulator secured in the bone beneath the skin concerts the signals into electric impulses and sends them though an internal cable to electrodes.

An array of electrodes wound through the cochlea send the impulses to the nerves in the scala tympani and then to the brain through the auditory nerve system.

As of December 2012, approximately 324,000 people worldwide have received cochlear implants.

In the best case scenario, the implants, which convert sound to electric impulses that travel to the brain, allow patients who cannot hear anything at all to achieve 100 per cent speech understanding.

Michael Dorman, an Arizona State University professor of speech and hearing science, made the discovery of what the world sounds like via an implant, when one of his patients who had lost hearing in both ears and had received an implant, regained his natural hearing in one of his ears.

‘That allowed us to have him match the sound quality of an implant with his hearing ear,’ he said.

‘And we'd always wondered, “what does it really sound like?”’

‘It was a tremendous help to us in understanding cochlear implants.’

The experts first experimented with tones in order to pinpoint what certain frequencies sound like to someone wearing an implant. The video shows that they appear slightly echoey, but nonetheless amazing to someone who has been without the ability to hear either temporarily or since birth.

They then showed what speech sounds like via a cochlear implant and it is clear – if slightly more robotic than natural hearing.

Professor Dorman’s team is currently working on a project to test the performance of patients by using a surround sound system that is calibrated so that if someone sits in the middle of the array of speakers, it sounds as if they are in a restaurant.

Busy spaces like restaurants can be a difficult places to distinguish speech for people with hearing difficulties.

'It's really a striking replication of the environment and will help them evaluate new signalling algorithms for the implant,’ he said.
