The college drama professor who gave Robin Williams his first stage role at aged 20 says that after watching the tragic actor on TV recently, 'he looked as if he had lost his charm.'

In an interview with MailOnline, Robin's friend and former drama professor James Dunn said, 'I hadn't seen Robin in a while but he was being interviewed on TV a month ago and I remember being shocked at how old he looked.

'For the first time his eyes looked deep set and his face looked tired. He always had an impish charm about him for as long as I can remember but that vanished.'

Charlie Chaplin of his generation: Dunn said: 'He always had an impish charm about him for as long as I can remember but that vanished'

Charmer: Dunn remembers Williams as a 'womaniser' who 'was from a very well-to-do family and he was an only child but he was always broke'

Dunn was devastated when he learned that his star pupil committed suicide dead body at his Californian home on Monday while his unwitting wife, Susan Schneider, slept in another room.

She revealed yesterday that Williams was in the early stages of Parkinson's Disease when he took his own life.

Speaking from his former office in the College of Marin, where he taught Williams for three years and continued to stay in contact, drama professor Dunn reveals how he was floored by Robin's talent from the getgo and compared his legacy to that of Charlie Chaplin.

'There was always this aura around him. He always had women attention. You just couldn't not love him and that definitely rubbed off on the ladies,' he said.

'He was a womanizer, there's no doubt about that - and he always seemed to be able to deal with anything.'

But Dunn never thought the 63-year-old was a self destructive person.

'He was a sharp guy. And even until recently Robin still seemed to be in good shape despite the major heart problems.

'There are
 some people who have demons but Robin wasn't that way, I never saw him 
as a dark person but some comics do have a dark side.

'I think it's hard to be funny and pull out the absurdities of life.'

Dunn said there was, however, a lot going on inside of him as with anyone who is that creative.

'He did a lot of drugs and then cleaned up on that. Then he got into alcohol and was in rehab a couple of times. When
 you look back on it you think "Well he lived life," he was like a moth 
to a flame - eventually he burnt out,' Dunn believes.

He thinks that the actor seemed indestructible.

'When he was my student I used to kick his a**, you've got to be able to put up with that. Robin's a true genius like Charlie Chaplin, and I think he'll be remembered the same way. It was an honor to know him personally and professionally, it's really sad.'

Talking to MailOnline, Dunn - who also hired Williams to work in his backyard - told how as a broke student he would borrow money from classmates and probably spent it on marijuana.

'He was from a very well-to-do family and he was an only child but he was always broke,' Dunn explains. 'So he was always borrowing money from every student. Every single one of them he owed money to because you just couldn't say no to him.'

Dunn first cast Williams, then 20, as Tranio in a wild west version of The Taming of the Shrew in 1971, and the class brought the show to Edinburgh Festival in Scotland that year.

Dunn also shared never before seen footage of a young Robin Williams behind the scenes of the school production.

The black and white video shows Williams, wearing cowboy attire for the Shakespeare adaptation, lapping up the attention in his first serious acting role and he is the last to leave after the final bow.

Williams and his fellow students - who raised money for the trip themselves - were rewarded by scooping the illustrious Best of The Fringe Award.

The rare archive footage shows Williams on stage in front of an audience that included Princess Margaret, who is also seen being greeted by cast members on her arrival at the theatre.

The 81-year-old, who recently retired, also recalled the moment he was first awestruck by the hilarious Williams during a rehearsal of Oliver! gone wrong.

'There were some sound problems and everyone was p***** off. It was like midnight and out of nowhere Robin started talking to the baton he was holding and then spoke back,' he said.

Dunn continued: 'Every person in the room went from being in a bad mood to hysterics with tears of laughter streaming down their face.

'I knew what kids in the group were going to go on and make it, I went home that night and told my wife "That boy's going to be a star." Robin blew my mind that night.Â 

Westward ho: 'There was always this aura around him,' Dunn says of Robin (standing, far right). 'You just couldn't not love him and that definitely rubbed off on the ladies'

'This guy, internationally known, invented a comedy that nobody else can do. Nobody can do Robin because he's so unique. For instance, in the mid-80s he came back to perform Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors - he did every single part and character by himself to help raise money for the college.'

Dunn recalled a touching anecdote from the Hollywood star who he remained close to until his final years.

'Robin used to work for me in my backyard and on his 40th birthday he invited me to his party in Napa,' he said.

'His family were preparing a book so I wrote this letter which said "Well, Robin, you used to work for me in my backyard for five dollars an hour." And since he was making a bit more money then so I finished it with "But I guess I'll pay you ten dollars now.'"

Despite reports of money troubles, Williams still gave generously to the college with yearly contributions of thousands of dollars over the last 20 years.

'He wouldn't have lived any differently if he wasn't famous, it's just who he was. He would have been a hyper individual no matter what,' Dunn reflected.

'Robin's made so much money that I imagine there may have been some bad deals along the way.'

The college will discuss memorial plans and consider various tributes to their most famous alumni.

'But we can't name the building after him,' joked Dunn, adding: 'Because it's already named after me!'
