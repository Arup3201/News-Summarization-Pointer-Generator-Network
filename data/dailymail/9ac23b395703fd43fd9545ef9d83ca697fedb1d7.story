A photograph of an iceberg claimed to be the one which sunk Titanic is being sold at auction for $10,000.

The black and white picture of the iceberg was taken two days before the sinking of the Titanic by the Captain of the S. S. Etonian on April 12, 1912.

The photograph is just one of over 400 Titanic memorabilia items included in American auction house RR Auction's sale next month.

Mugshot: The photograph of the 'guilty' iceberg was taken two days before the sinking of the Titanic

Experts believe it is the ‘guilty’ one due to its unusual shape, which matches sketches and eyewitness descriptions of the iceberg which fatally collided with the ‘unsinkable’ vessel on April 14, 1912, killing 1,502 people.

The black and white picture of the floating ice berg is set to make $8,000-$10,000 (£5,016 - £6,270).

Through the years a number of photographs have been claimed to depict the one which sealed the fate of the famous vessel, but experts say this one is the definite mugshot.

Titanic expert Stanley Lehrer said: ‘In my professional judgement this iceberg is the one that sunk the Titanic.’

‘Within the past two years, I discovered a photograph that had been taken by Captain Wood of the S.S. Etonian on 12th April 1912.

‘The captain took the pictures because he was fascinated with the unusual shape of the iceberg.

'This particular iceberg had an ellipse on the top right of the iceberg.'

A handwritten caption, scrawled directly onto the developed picture states the coordinates of the iceberg as 'Latitude 410 0 W Long 490 50 N' - not far from the widely documented position where Titanic sunk.

The caption scribbled on the photo reads: ‘Blueberg taken by Captain Good S. S. Etonian on 12/4/12 in Lat 410 50 W Long 490 50 N. Titanic struck 14/4/12 and sank in three hours."

Frederick Fleet, the lookout on duty who first spotted the iceberg, and Joseph Scarrott, an able-bodied seaman, both drew sketches of the ice which are eerily similar.

A spokesman for RR Auction, which are selling a total of 408 items in connection with Titanic said: ‘The story of the Titanic still resonates both here in America as well as in England.

‘To be able to auction a photo of the iceberg that sank the unsinkable is quite remarkable and something we are proud to offer to our clients from around the world.’
