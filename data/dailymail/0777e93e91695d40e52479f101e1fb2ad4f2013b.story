Shamed former IMF-chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has told a court that tales of his roles in sex parties with prostitutes have been exaggerated as he 'only' attended four per year.

The 65-year-old, who is facing charges of 'aggravated pimping', tried to play down his role in the alleged sex ring, saying he only attended 12 orgies in three years.

Topless protesters  jumped on his car as he arrived at the court in Lille, north of France, this morning, where the disgraced finance boss gave evidence today.

The former chief of the International Monetary Fund was giving evidence today at the courthouse in Lille, where he said the frequency of sex parties was 'rare' and had been 'exaggerated'.

But on his arrival, three women from the feminist group Femen, who had slogans scrawled on their half-naked bodies jumped on the vehicle carrying Strauss Kahn.

They also hurled insults as the car he was travelling in attempted to enter an underground parking area at the court in Lille, northern France.

They were eventually rounded up by police with pictures showing some of the women lying on the floor while officers tried to detain them.

The protest came as Strauss Kahn arrived at court this morning where he testified in his alleged role in sex parties with prostitutes. 

The three women, who had slogans scrawled on their half-naked bodies also hurled abuse at the car carrying Strauss Kahn 

Police eventually rounded up the three women with one of them being held on the ground as she was detained by officers 

The 65-year-old is accused of participating in a French sex ring and instigating parties involving prostitutes in the northern French city of Lille, as well as Paris, Brussels and Washington DC between 2008 and 2011.

His lawyers acknowledge their client took part in the parties but say he did not know the women were prostitutes and have rejected the charge against him of pimping, or 'procuring with aggravating circumstances.'

But giving evidence today he said he rarely took part in sex parties adding that there were only 12 parties in total - that is four per year over three years.

He also insisted that he hadn't committed a crime or any offence and attacked his accusers, saying he had done nothing wrong, and simply enjoyed a 'libertine' sex life.

Looking tired and drawn, and dressed in dark navy blue suit, Strauss-Kahn stood with his hands folded as judges asked him questions.

The protest this morning came as Strauss Kahn arrived at court for the trial where he is expected to give evidence today

One of his accusers meanwhile told the court that she was 'forced into' certain sex acts against her will, while Strauss-Kahn stared at her 'smiling'.

Referring to his co-defendants, Strauss-Kahn told the court: 'We didn't communicate daily. I had, without wanting to sound pretentious, other things to do at the time'.

Strauss-Kahn, who was said to be the 'King of the Party' in the vice ring, added: 'One has the impression of frenetic activity, but we only had four meetings a year for three years.'

Asked about the prostitutes who attended his sex parties, the man who is known in France by his initials DSK, replied: 'If you want to know if I was aware of the status of these young women, then the answer is no. 

'I had no knowledge that they were prostitutes.'

Four prostitutes identified as Melanie, Mounia, Sabrina and Sandrine are civil plaintiffs in the case.

Today was the first time he has come face-to-face with two of them, now retired sex workers, since the parties.

DSK, who was married to the journalist and art heiress Anne Sinclair at the time of the offences, denies all the charges.

Investigating magistrates say that the charge applies because in France it covers any activity seen as facilitating prostitution

In Strauss-Kahn's case, it is alleged that he allowed his rented apartment to be used for sex parties involving prostitutes and that the parties were organised for his benefit.

The three-week trial began last week with 14 people, including Strauss-Kahn, defendants in the 'Carlton Affair' case, so named after the hotel in Lille that sparked the investigation into a sex ring.

Strauss-Kahn, who was once tipped for the French presidency now says his political career is over and risks as much as 10 years in prison and a fine of up to 1.5 million euros (£1.1million) if convicted.

He served as French finance minister in the late 1990s before becoming one of the world's most influential decision-makers in 2007 as head of the International Monetary Fund, a public lender that plays a central role worldwide in the rescue of failing economies.

But his high-flying career ended in May 2011 when he was escorted handcuffed into custody in New York following accusations of sexual assault by a New York maid in 2011, which were eventually dropped.
