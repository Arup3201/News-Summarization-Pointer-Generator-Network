Real Madrid are looking to extend their 21-game winning streak by defeating San Lorenzo to claim their first ever Club World Cup title.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Co have been in scintillating form - winning the Champions League, Copa del Rey and European Super Cup in 2014 - and reached the final in Marrakech with a 4-0 demolition of Mexican side Cruz Azul in the semi-finals.

Copa Libertadores champions San Lorenzo, who are incidentally the team supported by Pope Francis, needed extra-time to defeat Auckland City 2-1 in their semi final.
