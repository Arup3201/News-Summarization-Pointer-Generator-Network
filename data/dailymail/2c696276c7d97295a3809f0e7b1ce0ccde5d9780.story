As the classic Australian invention of the cask wine turns 50 this year, the best goon bags on offer are revealed.

Many of us associate drinking from a shiny silver bladder as our cheap and nasty introduction to wine in our clueless youth - however casks have come a long way in the past half of a century.

So much so that in 2015, one in every three glasses of wine drunk in Australia actually comes out of a cask.

A stark contrast to back in 1973 when the cask hadn't taken off yet and drinking wine was only consumed on special occasions - hence each Aussie only drank about 9.8 litres of wine per year.

This figure jumped to 19.3 litres per capita consumption over the next decade as people really got into the boxed varietal.

Drew Lambert, a member of the popular wine blog, taste-tested all casks that were taken out of their boxes, numbered and then pegged to the clothes line 

The Wine W*****s blog decided to test 10 of Australia's most premium cask wine in the most stereotypically ocker way possible - hanging the bags from yet another fair-dinkum Aussie invention - the Hills Hoist clothes line - otherwise known as the Goon of Fortune game.

Drew Lambert, a member of the popular wine blog, taste-tested all casks that were taken out of their boxes, numbered and then pegged to the clothes line.

Drew encourages wine lovers to check out the variety of cask wines that is now on offer. 

'If you haven’t ventured into the cask section of your local bottle shop lately, you’re in for a treat. 

'Cask producers have responded to the trend of consumers drinking less wine, but drinking better quality. 

'You’ll now find real varieties and actual vintages, and even popular regions such as McLaren Vale and Marlborough.'

But enough about educational side of things - let's find out what Drew's taste buds believe are the top of the line in the cask wine world.
