A Scottish island that has been trapped in time for decades is going on the market for £250,000 and could one day play host to eco tourists.

The 64-acre island of Linga is listed for the same price as a two-bedroom flat in Edinburgh or Glasgow even though it has no power or water supply or a house which is move-in ready.

Located in the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland, Linga’s eventual owner will be permitted to create an eco-tourism business, install wind-generated power, build a pier for boat access and restore two derelict croft houses as holiday homes.

If the island sells and someone moves in it would be inhabited for the first time in over 80 years, although it is closer to Norway than it is to Scotland.

The last known person to have lived on the island, part of the most northerly group of the British Isles, is reported to have been Captain James Fraser, who died in 1931.

The stunning island lies in the Vaila Sound with just a few hundred yards of sea separating it from the mainland Shetland village of Walls.

Sheltered from the Atlantic Ocean by the larger island of Vaila and surrounded by blue waters the island is small enough to walk across in less than half an hour.

Untouched for a generation it includes pristine white beaches, a loch and an abundance of wildlife, according to a brochure from Shetland Estate, the listing agent.

The brochure says: ‘Visitors would be able to take part in traditional crofting and fishing activities experiencing first-hand the annual cycle of activities required to support crofting during this period.

‘Considerable design and study work has been completed along with a fully developed business plan.’

Evidence of prehistoric settlements prove continuous occupation and human activity on the island for several thousand years.

Linga's current owner, Bob Thomson, hopes someone will finish off his ambitious project

In 1881 it is recorded to have been home to 13 people split between the two families but by 1901 only one of the houses was inhabited.

Linga’s current owner, Bob Thomson, is selling the island with hopes that the new owner will revive it and finish off his ambitious project.

It would give tourists the chance experience life as it was on a traditional Shetland croft at the end of the 19th century.

Mr Thomson, who grew up in Shetland and bought the island in 2008, said: ‘I was brought up in Walls and as a child used to play on the island in the school holidays with friends as we grew up in small boats.

‘It needs a younger person to take over and complete the concept.’

He added: ‘Owning an island is Shetland is the best feeling ever and it is very sad to have consider selling especially as the development concept has received such fantastic local support.

‘When talking to people abroad about owning the island they are always really impressed. My wife especially likes to tell people we meet overseas about Linga.’

Linga’s new owner will have permission to rebuild the derelict croft houses alongside a new cottage to provide self-catering accommodation with en-suite facilities and ground source heat pumps.

And there are approvals for a windmill and solar panels to provide electricity to the island for the first time, in addition to new sewage systems and rainwater capture systems for water supply.
