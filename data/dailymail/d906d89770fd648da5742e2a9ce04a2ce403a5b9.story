Prince Andrew came under renewed fire yesterday over his continued links with one of the most corrupt regimes in the world.

His friendship with Azerbaijan’s billionaire dictator Ilham Aliyev was one reason why the duke stood down from his role as UK trade envoy last year.

But it has emerged that last week he held a private meeting at Buckingham Palace with Britain’s ambassador to the oil-rich state.

Palace officials say his discussion with Peter Bateman was instigated by the diplomat.

But the meeting raised fresh 
questions about links with the former Soviet state’s president – who has
 been accused of torturing political opponents and election rigging – 
and angered critics of the regime.

Natalia Nozadze of Amnesty 
International said: ‘We can only hope that Prince Andrew, who no longer 
has an official role in promoting trade, is instead using these 
“private” talks at Buckingham Palace to persuade the ambassador to raise
 serious concerns about the numerous human rights abuses in Azerbaijan.

‘These include the routine use of 
excessive and brutal force by police, restrictions on public protest, 
and the censorship imposed on bloggers and journalists who are beaten 
and imprisoned for criticising the government.’

Andrew has visited Azerbaijan’s 
leader, who is said to be a close friend, eight times in six years. His 
dealings with the despot range from official trips and private holidays 
to throwing a luncheon for president Aliyev at Buckingham Palace in 
2009.

He even made a detour to the country 
the following year on the way home from an official tour of the Middle 
East just to attend a dinner held by the president. During one stay he 
was reported to have visited a luxury spa owned by Mr Aliyev, which 
employs a blind Russian masseur described as having ‘the best hands in 
the world’.

The regularity of Andrew’s visits to 
Azerbaijan – where he is referred to as ‘the dear guest’ – has led to 
speculation in the country’s media that he may have business links to 
the state, including a golf resort on the Caspian Sea. However, 
Buckingham Palace has denied this.

2011 amid a political storm over his friendship with US billionaire 
Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.

Dogged by claims of lavish spending 
as he jetted around the world, ‘Airmiles Andy’ was also criticised for 
his friendships with leaders such as president Aliyev.

Andrew courted controversy last 
November when, despite standing down from his globe-trotting trade role,
 he made four taxpayer-funded foreign trips in eight weeks – including 
an unexplained detour on a private jet for a visit to Azerbaijan.

In January this year he provoked more
 criticism during a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, 
Switzerland, where taxpayers faced a bill of almost £13,000 for his 
eight-bedroom ski chalet.

In between attending a reception for 
UK businessmen and six hours on the ski slopes, Andrew held a meeting 
with president Aliyev.

Buckingham Palace last night strongly
 denied Andrew was in  regular contact with UK Government officials 
connected with Azerbaijan. A spokesman said that on this occasion the 
ambassador was in London at the time and had offered to go to the palace
 and brief the duke about British interests in the region.

He last visited Andrew just over a year before that.

‘Ambassadors come to see senior 
members of the Royal Family on a regular basis. Their conversations are 
private but the meetings are always openly listed in the Court 
Circular,’ the spokesman said.

A spokesman for the duke confirmed 
that he visited Azerbaijan on four occasions between 2005 and 2009 at 
the request of either the Foreign and Commonwealth Office or UK Trade 
and Industry

He travelled there on a further three
 occasions in a semi-official capacity. Officially classed as private 
trips, the duke paid for these out of his own pocket, but they were 
still recorded on the Court Circular because each time he officially met
 the president.

The spokesman added: ‘Despite 
relinquishing his official trade role, as a senior member of the Royal 
Family the duke continues to carry out public engagements on behalf of 
the country and is particularly keen to promote British industry both 
here and abroad.’
