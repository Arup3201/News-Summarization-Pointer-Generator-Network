The sister of a glamour model who was brutally murdered by her husband has died after turning to alcohol to help her cope with the loss.

Hayley Wilkinson, 31, from Whoberley, Coventry, struggled with the pain of losing her beloved younger sister five years ago and died from poor health after turning to drink. 

Her heartbroken mother Catherine Bloomfield said her daughter started drinking heavily after her sister Kirsty, 24, was strangled by her lorry driver husband Paul Grabham in March 2009.

The 58-year-old, of Bridgend, South Wales, said: 'Grabham has got the blood of both my daughters on his hands. Hayley would still be here if her little sister hadn't been taken away.

'I just cannot believe what has happened - losing one child was bad enough.

'Kirsty's death was awful. You can't even comprehend it. You think you could predict the heartache but you couldn't come close.

'I just think if there was a God why does he let this sort of thing happen? I think to myself what have I ever done in my life to deserve this?'

Grabham, 29, is currently serving a life sentence for murdering Kirsty after a row at their home in Swansea, South Wales.

Kirsty was working part-time as a glamour model and in the entertainment business when she was strangled to death by Grabham. 

He later attempted to chop her body in half before stuffing it in a suitcase and dumping it at the side of the M4 motorway near Bridgend.

The body was discovered by a lorry driver less than a week later.

Kirsty's sister Hayley was in court for Grabham's trial and was forced to relive the final moments of her sister's life. After the trial, she moved to Coventry to try and get away from the painful memories.

Ms Wilkinson said: 'She loved life, she was always giggling and didn't have a bad bone in her body.

'She was nice to everybody and she never ran anybody down. Hayley took people at face value.'

However, she said her daughter turned to alcohol after failing to cope with her sister's death and died on October 11 due to alcohol-related causes and under-lying health problems.

She said: 'She started to drink to excess five years ago. She had just lost her little sister and she couldn't cope.

Hayley, who had a daughter, died on October 11

'Hayley would never have drank to the extent that she did if her little sister had still been here.

'The drink took over everything. It stopped her going out. She just sat on her own in her house.

'She never really had anyone for her in Coventry. She was basically on her own.

'Five years of drinking led to her death. She wasn't eating either, she was just drinking.

'I want to help people that have drink problems. Maybe they will look at Hayley and see what has happened to her and seek help.

'I honestly don't know what I could have done differently. Maybe I'd have locked her in her room, anything to protect her.

'I did try to get her help. I tried everything to help her but Hayley marched to her own tune and she was her own person.

'She thought she was invincible. She never thought for a second that this would happen.'

Hayley's funeral was held at Canley Crematorium in Coventry on October 17 and was attended by dozens of friends and family, including her young daughter who she hadn't seen for a number of years.

Ms Wilkinson said: 'She had been searching for her little girl and she turned up. It was Hayley's dying wish to see her to see her little girl and she never got that.

'She had a lovely turnout for her funeral considering it all happened so quickly.

'It was beautiful. I asked everybody to wear something purple because it was Hayley's favourite colour.'

Paul Grabham, 26, of Swansea, South Wales, murdered wife Kirsty, 24, after a violent drink and drug-fuelled row at their city flat in March 2009.

He strangled her to death before attempting to chop her body in half, hiding it in a suitcase and dumping it beside the M4 near Bridgend. It was found nearly  a week after she was last seen by a lorry driver.

A Swansea Crown Court jury took just five hours to find Grabham unanimously guilty of her murder at the end of a 15-day trial. 

The judge, Mr Justice Butterfield, angrily threatened to clear the court after family and friends of the victim shouted in triumph as the verdict was delivered.

He jailed Grabham for life with a recommendation that he serve a minimum term of 19 years in prison.

Passing sentence, Mr Justice Butterfield told Grabham that his actions had been 'cold and calculated' and without remorse.

'I have watched throughout this trial for the merest flicker of remorse in your eyes and I have seen none,' he told him.

He added: 'You have been convicted of murder - just one year after you promised to love and cherish your new bride, you battered and strangled her to death.

'It was a vicious and sustained attack fuelled by drink and drugs that you had taken and it is without doubt that your intention was to kill her.

'But she was not to have, even in death, the decency and dignity to which, undoubtedly, she was entitled.

'You crammed her bleeding and still warm body into a suitcase like so much rubbish, hoping it would not be found for many years.'

During the trial, Grabham insisted he had had nothing to do with his wife's violent murder.

Despite evidence from neighbours detailing a violent two-hour argument they heard the couple having, he claimed it had never happened.

Grabham returned early to the couple's flat on March 27 2009 after arguing with his wife at a Swansea nightclub.

His wife came home in the early hours of the next day and was never seen again.

Confronted with evidence showing her blood on his shoes and jeans and the walls and ceiling of their home, Grabham said he had no explanation for it.

Asked why he had painted over areas of the walls and ceiling stained by his wife's blood, he simply said he had not.

He maintained that he had come home drunk and was asleep on the sofa when his wife returned and left, never to be seen again.

Kirsty was strangled to death by Grabham at their Swansea flat (pictured) in March 2009 following a row

When he got up the next day he surfed an online 'dogging' site looking for sex and in the afternoon visited a local brothel for sex.

Two days after the murder he reported his wife missing and quickly became the key suspect in the police inquiry. 

After the verdict, Mrs Grabham's family praised the jury and thanked South Wales Police for bringing Grabham to justice.
