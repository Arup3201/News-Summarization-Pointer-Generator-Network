A baby-faced and self-proclaimed 'leader' of a gang has been jailed for torturing and terrorising a family.

Ricky Purcell, a slight-looking 20-year-old, bragged that he was the 'Mr Big' 
behind a gang which carried out an attack on a couple’s flat in 
Bodmin, Cornwall.

Six men wearing balaclavas forced their way into the family home armed with knives and hammers, and attempted to extort money from the couple for drugs.

Baby-faced: Ricky Purcell described himself to officers as the 'Mr Big' of the armed attack in Cornwall

The gang struck the mother on the head and body, and inflicted deep cuts on her partner.

During the attack the woman’s 11-year-old son - who was hiding under a bed - offered them his £4 pocket money so they would go away.

Purcell described himself as 'Mr Big' to officers - but probation officers believed this was simply bravado.

Prosecutor Elaine Hobson said that 
when the mother answered her door at lunchtime, the men barged in and 
pushed her into the bathroom where she was hit on the head and body.

Terrifying ordeal: The attack happened in Ringway Flats, Bodmin

She screamed at them not to hurt her 
children before the gang, armed with knives and hammers, inflicted deep 
cuts on her partner’s arm in the bedroom - as her son hid under the bed.

The men demanded cash but when the woman said they did not have any, her son offered them his pocket money.

Judge Phillip Wassall said the attack was an attempt to extort money

After the attack Purcell gave himself up to police and said he had planned the attack and had wounded the man.

Purcell, of no fixed address, admitted
 violent disorder during the attack on February 26, and was sent to a 
Young Offenders’ Institute for six years and eight months by Judge 
Philip Wassall.

Purcell 
refused to name the other members of the gang, who had Mancunian and 
Liverpool accents.

They are still being hunted by police.

Nigel Hall, defending, said that Purcell was young and immature for his age
 and that he had been exploited.

Judge Wassall told Truro Crown Court 
that Purcell had been part of a joint exercise to extort money from the 
occupants and that it had been to do with drugs.

He said it must have 
been an 'absolutely 
terrifying experience' for the three victims, in particular the boy, who
 watched his mother kicked and beaten, and her partner slashed with a 
knife.

Police said they are still hunting the rest of the gang but were pleased with the sentence meted out to Purcell.
