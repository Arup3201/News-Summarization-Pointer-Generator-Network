Freed from the pressure of maintaining a remarkable podium streak, Jonny Brownlee has vowed to take the race to brother Alistair in Thursday’s triathlon.

Between 2010 and May 2014, the 24-year-old finished in the top three in every race, winning Olympic bronze and the world title in 2012.

But in back-to-back World Triathlon Series races in Yokohama and London, he could finish only fifth.

It was a blow but also a blessing.

Jonny goes into the Glasgow Games on the back of finishing third in Hamburg earlier this month and he is ready to throw everything into trying to beat Olympic champion Alistair.

‘In a way, I quite like not having a podium streak, because it was playing on my mind,’ he said.

‘It was a lot of pressure. I stood on the start-line and there were lots of other people who didn’t have anything to lose, whereas I had a podium streak to lose.’

Jonny started the season in decent form but was well beaten by Spanish rival Javier Gomez in both Auckland and Cape Town, before the two fifth-place finishes left him questioning everything in his training and preparation.

‘I think I over-trained a little bit in the winter and then lacked that real  top-end training,’ he said.‘Not having Alistair training with me definitely affected that.’

Alistair was recovering from his now customary early-season injury problems but, as usual, the older sibling appears to have timed things right, winning the European Championships and the race in Hamburg.

‘Alistair’s very fit,’ Jonny said. ‘This course definitely suits him. It’s a very hard bike and it suits his aggressive racing, but I’ll try my best.

‘In training we’ve been very similar so all I can do is try — again.’
