A teenage hoaxer told police a bomb was set to explode at a packed shopping centre - so his fed-up brother could finish his shift at Burger King early.

Luke Brown, 18, called 999 and claimed there was a device in the Castle Mall food court in Norwich city centre which was due to go off in six hours time.

But the crazy stunt went wrong immediately as cops swooped on the phone box where he was on Long John Hill and arrested him, a court heard on Friday.

Bomb threat: Luke Brown, 18, called 999 and claimed there was a bomb set to explode - to get his brother out of work at Burger King in Norwich

Furious police last night blasted Brown's incredible 'stupidity' after he was locked up for six months.

He was also rapped as being childish and immature by his own solicitor.

After the bomb threat was made, the shopping complex was quickly searched and cleared by police but no-one was evacuated.

Brown, of Norwich, admitted making the bomb hoax on March 6.

He told police his brother was working in Burger King and 'wanted to go home early' so he'd asked if he could ring police and 'make something up'.

Brown asked to enter the witness box at Norwich Crown Court yesterday to tell Judge Stephen Holt he was 'very sorry'.

Sentencing the teenager to six months in a young offenders' institution, Judge Holt said it was an 'unsophisticated prank' and branded Brown a 'foolish young man'.

But he said he would be 'failing in his public duty' if he did not pass an immediate custodial sentence.

Judge Holt told Brown: 'People must learn that you cannot send out bomb hoaxes because if you do you will end up in prison.'

Richard Kelly, prosecuting, said police carried out a 'discreet search' of the busy shopping centre but quickly established it was a hoax.

Mr Kelly said nine police officers, two police community support officers, a dog unit and a crime scene investigator all rushed to the scene.

Michael Clare, defending, said Brown, who suffers from learning difficulties and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, pleaded guilty and had been a 'stupid boy'.

Mr Clare said it was 'far removed from the sort of thing' that was 'politically motivated' or something that was 'criminally sophisticated'.

He said: 'It's a childish immature prank by someone who is seriously academically challenged.'

Speaking after the case, Superintendent Neil Baily, of Norfolk Police, said: 'It's astonishing to think of the stupidity of someone who would call to make a bomb hoax just to get his brother off work early.

'In any case our priority is the safety of the public and we have to treat these incidents seriously from the outset. Hoax calls are not victimless crimes.

'They create fear and disruption to the community and also require a significant amount of resource from emergency services.'

He stressed: 'The sentence underlines the seriousness of deliberately wasting police time and taking resources away from legitimate demands.

'We will always seek to prosecute where appropriate and I hope this case acts as a warning to others.'
