Hull City have made an offer to take Carl Jenkinson on a permanent deal.

The 22-year-old can leave Arsenal and was initially set to leave on loan.

Arsenal signed Calum Chambers from Southampton on Monday in a £12million deal that could rise to £16m, and it is clear Jenkinson is now surplus to requirements. They have also signed right back Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle for £10m.

Hull have bid around £3m but the player is valued closer to £5m by Arsenal.

Jenkinson's preference is to stay in London and West Ham would be favourites if they match or better the bid.

Hull

over Harry Maguire - despite the Yorkshire club initially rejecting 
Hull's offer last week.

Swansea, who have asked about Tottenham's Kyle Naughton, and Sunderland have also shown an interest in Jenkinson.

West Ham are continuing to look for a striker also but strain exists between manager Sam Allardyce and the club's owners.

Hull have also signed Robert Snodgrass, Jake Livermore and Tom Ince this summer.
