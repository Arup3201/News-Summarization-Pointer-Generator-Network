Islamic State have released their most boring and uninspiring propaganda photos on social media today, revealing gardening as one of the little known past time shared by their supporters. 

The dull photos appear to be an attempt by the brutal extremist group to show an interest in the environment and other calmer activities.

The images were taken in the Iraqi province of Nineveh, home to some of the most fertile earth in the Middle East. 

The ISIS photographer's report documents the garden nurseries in Nineveh province, Iraq.

One grey bearded customer is shown inspecting a pot plant. He appears to be one of the only customers in the empty garden centre.

For all the green-fingered ISIS supporters, the state apparently has a range of plants available on sale for cheap prices in the ancient Assyrian province of Nineveh in Iraq.

Surprisingly healthy looking orange pansies can be seen neatly potted up in the homemade greenhouse. 

It appears that when they are not fighting the Kurds or dodging coalition airstrikes, residents in Islamic State enjoy pottering around their garden. 

Surrounded by a selection of other plants, orange pansies can be seen neatly potted up in the garden centre.

Constructed out of green fabric and held together by a bamboo structure, the greenhouse is filled with a selection of garden plants and neatly trimmed trees.

Some of the plants appear surprisingly healthy looking considering the fierce heat in Nineveh province, Iraq.

It is unclear when the nursery was opened but its dire shortage of customers suggests gardening might not as popular as ISIS had thought in Iraq.

Pansies appear to be a popular choice among the few green fingered residents of Islamic State in Iraq.

Whilst several middle aged men appear to tending to the plants, few customers are shown buying any of the plants in the nursery. As usual, not a single woman is shown in any of the photos. 

One man is shown struggling to put a large plant into the boot of his car. Another grey bearded man is shown posing with  a pot plant in his hands.

With its spotlessly clean path and perfectly lined up plants, the photos underline the new level of boring propaganda from  the ISIS propaganda media groups.
