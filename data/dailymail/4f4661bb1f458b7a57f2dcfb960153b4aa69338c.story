Horrible: Curtez Graham, 18, raped a 65-year-old woman as revenge after he was sent to prison for twice burglarizing her home

An 18-year-old man raped a 65-year-old woman as revenge after he was sent to prison for twice burglarizing her home - and now he's going back behind bars.

Curtez Deshawn Graham returned this past June to the twice-burglarized St paul, MN., home after being furloughed from prison and raped the woman after blaming her for his previous imprisonment, the victim told police.

‘B***h, you sent me to prison for 14 months,’ he snarled at the woman while standing naked in her bedroom menacingly holding a pair of scissors, said an affidavit cited by the Pioneer Press.

Mr Graham removed his ankle bracelet while out of a St Paul juvenile correctional facility on work release and headed to the couple’s home after only nine days.

The frightened couple woke up to see the crazed man naked and threatening to kill them with the scissors if they did not do as he said, according to the affidavit.

He forced the man to tie himself up, revenge raped his helpless victim and then forced her to wash between her legs while taking a shower, the affidavit said.

‘We seldom see crimes as completely inhumane as this,’ prosecutor C. Ryan Tennison said in court. ‘This man raped the victim in her home in front of her loved one.’

The ex-con pleaded guilty Sept 30 first-degree criminal sexual conduct, first-degree burglary and kidnapping.

Mr Graham will spend the next 25 ½ years in prison for his depraved actions.
