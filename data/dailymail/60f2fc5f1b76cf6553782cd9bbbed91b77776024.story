A man was chased across a city centre park and stabbed to death by a gang following an argument over a £10 drug debt for meow meow, a court has heard.

Neil Bennett, 50, was stabbed once in the back before being fatally knifed again in the chest during the argument over a mephedrone deal - known as MCAT or Meow Meow – in the centre of Gloucester on the evening of July 27 last year.

Ricky James, 34, Lucy Dowdall, 20, Christopher Horn, 30, and Tyler Johnson, 26, are all on trial at Bristol Crown Court accused of his murder.

Prosecutors allege that Horn delivered the fatal blow having been egged on by Dowdall - with all four acting ‘jointly’ to murder Mr Bennett.

The victim and a friend had gone to a flat in the city centre where three of the defendants lived to buy drugs from Horn, who is said to be a dealer, the court heard.

Prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC told the jury: ‘It wasn’t a social or friendly visit.

‘It was clearly about drugs or a small £10 debt and some bad feeling arose from that debt.

‘It may be that you will think that having heard all the evidence that Neil Bennett was trying to obtain more drugs without having paid for them and that’s why he went around.’

Less than an hour later he had been fatally knifed having been chased through Gloucester Park, which is close to the flat where James, Dowdall and Horn lived.

Mr Langdon said that CCTV - although not showing the stabbings - showed Mr Bennett brandishing a pair of tweezers or a small knife towards the defendants.

‘At one point Christopher Horn bares his chest and invites Neil Bennett to stab him,’ Mr Langdon said.

‘There were witnesses in a car and they describe two men fighting, clearly Mr Bennett and Christopher Horn.

‘The witnesses in the car noticed Lucy Dowdall and their impression was that she was playing a prominent role in egging the men on to have a go.

‘She says to one of the others, referring to Ricky James, “You meant to be his boy. You let this happen. You going to do anything about it now?”

‘It is shortly after that the violence begins and the prosecution say that each of the three men on trial with Lucy Dowdall went on to play a part in the attack on Neil Bennett - ultimately resulting in his death.’

Mr Langdon said that after being stabbed in the back, Mr Bennett was shouting and threatening to return ‘with his boys’.

‘Whether that was a meaningful threat or something said in defiance by a wounded or frightened man is something you will perhaps have to consider,’ he said.

Mr Bennett ran away across the park, followed by the four defendants, where he was stabbed for a second time, allegedly by Horn with a knife taken from the kitchen of the flat.

 

‘It was clearly about drugs or a small £10 debt and some bad feeling arose from that debt.'

People who went to the aid of Mr Bennett thought he had been in a collision with a car as he was lying in the road.

‘Mark Newman, a security guard, noticed that very near to the wound and sticking through a leather jacket was the blade of a knife with no handle,’ Mr Langdon said.

‘It is unclear how and at what point the blade has been pulled out from the wound because it transpired that certain witnesses had seen the blade protruding from the chest of the man as he staggered around and fell.’

The knife wound had pierced Mr Bennett’s heart and he died despite medical treatment.

After leaving the scene, the four defendants disposed of clothing and went back to the flat to wash before returning to the vicinity where they were quizzed by police and allowed to move on.

‘They gave no indication that they knew anything about what had happened,’ Mr Langdon said.

Johnson then went home and the others went back to the flat. At around 10pm the three went out again and were stopped a second time and arrested by police.

Johnson was arrested the next day.

‘Each of these four, in different ways, is jointly responsible for the death of Neil Bennett,’ Mr Langdon said.

James, Horn and Dowdall, of Gloucester, and Johnson, of no fixed address, deny murder. The trial at Bristol Crown Court, pictured, has been adjourned until tomorrow

‘If you conclude it was Christopher Horn that held the knife that stabbed Neil Bennett, causing both wounds, you will need to consider the roles of the other three defendants because the prosecution say this was a joint enterprise, where each shoulders joint roles for the murder of Mr Bennett.

‘Indeed if you are not sure it was Christopher Horn that inflicted the fatal wound, provided you are sure it was one of those defendants that did so and it was the product of joint enterprise, you may convict any defendant you think was part of that.’

James, Horn and Dowdall, of Gloucester, and Johnson, of no fixed address, deny murder.

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.
