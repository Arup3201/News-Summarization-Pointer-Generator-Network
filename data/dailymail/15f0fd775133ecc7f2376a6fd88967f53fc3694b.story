Devastated: Olivia Hicks died when she was run over by her mother Kelly Quigley-Hicks, after being dropped off at her grandmother's house

A four-year-old girl died when she was run over by her mother after being dropped off at her grandmother's house, neighbours said today.

Olivia Hicks is understood to have darted behind the car as it reversed down the driveway.

She was pinned beneath the vehicle for nearly an hour before fire fighters managed to free her.

An air ambulance took her to hospital where staff at first hoped she would recover when a scan revealed no broken bones.

But
she died five days later as a result of brain damage, to the 
devastation of her mother, local government officer Kelly Quigley-Hicks,
and father Graham Hicks, an investment adviser for Deutsche Bank.

Police have been informed of the accident in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, but have made no arrests.

A
woman who lives near the scene of the tragedy said yesterday: 'I was 
told the mother was reversing the car down the driveway and the little 
girl got in the way.

Another homeowner added: 'Apparently the child gets dropped off with the grandmother when the mother goes to work.

'She usually runs inside the house but this time she went around the back.'

Neighbours said they had been putting cards of condolence through the door.

One said: 'It is a very sad subject. The family have not lived there long, probably about a year.

'The fire engine and police were there for ages. They asked us to stay inside.

'The helicopter could not land on the grass near the house so it had to land at the school.' 

Speaking from his £400,000 
four-bedroom semi-detached house, also in Biggleswade, last night, Mr 
Hicks said the family were too upset to talk.

'I am sorry, we have no comment to make,' he said.

A
woman believed to be Olivia's grandmother, Catherine, answered the door
yesterday at the semi-detached house where she was fatally injured but 
also declined to comment.

Olivia had just arrived at her grandmother's home at 8.30am on February 20 when she was trapped under the Ford Focus.

Emergency: Olivia was taken by air ambulance to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge around an hour after the accident, but she died five days later from brain damage

Paramedics rushed to the leafy suburban road and administered pain relief while fire fighters stabilised the car before using airbags to lift the vehicle.

Olivia was taken by air ambulance to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge around an hour after the accident.

Her parents, who are understood to have another young child, endured an agonising five-day ordeal before she lost her fight to live.

An inquest opened and adjourned by the Cambridgeshire coroner yesterday gave the primary cause of death as 'catastrophic, irreversible brain injury'.

A secondary cause was given as 'injuries sustained in a road accident'.

A Bedfordshire Police spokesman said a full investigation had been launched.

He added: 'A four-year-old girl has died after being involved in a collision in Biggleswade on February 20.

'She was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital for treatment and subsequently died.'
