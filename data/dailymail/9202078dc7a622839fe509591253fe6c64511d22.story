Accused: Donna Perry says she underwent a sex change in 2000 to stop being violent

A transgender woman accused of shooting dead three prostitutes in 1990 has blamed the killings on her violent male persona.

Donna Perry, 62, appeared in court in Spokane, Washington on Tuesday - 24 years after she allegedly murdered the women and dumped their bodies on the banks of the Spokane River.

When Perry was arrested in connection with the crimes in 2012, she claimed that she had transitioned into a female in 2000 to stop her male persona - Doug Perry - from being violent.

'Douglas didn't stop, 
Donna stopped it,' Perry told police about the killings, according to an affidavit filed in January. 'I'm not going to admit I killed anybody, I didn't. Donna has killed nobody.'

When asked if Doug was responsible, she responded: 'I don't know if 
Doug did or not, it was 20 years ago and I have no idea whether he did 
or did not,' according to ABC News.

In claims that experts say will only fuel misunderstandings about transgender people, Perry claimed she had the sex-change operation in Thailand - which involves removing the testicles and therefore affecting testosterone production - 'as a 
permanent way to control violence'.

She claimed when a person transitions from male to female, 'there's a great downturn in violence' - which experts deny.

She is accused of killing Yolanda 
Sapp, Kathleen Brisbois and Nicki Lowe, whom police say were 
prostitutes, and dumping their naked bodies on the river banks.

After
 the case ran cold for more than two decades, Perry was linked to the 
crimes through DNA and fingerprint evidence allegedly left at the murder
 scenes.

According to the affidavit, detectives also interviewed a woman who had shared a cell with Perry during a stint in an Oregon prison in 1998.

She claimed that Perry said she had killed nine prostitutes 'because she couldn't breed and the women had the ability to have children and they were wasting it being "pond scum".'

Perry is being held on $1 million bond in
 a Spokane County jail and initially refused to appear in court on 
Monday. On Tuesday, the judge issued a drag order and she was forced to 
appear, KHQ reported.

Victim: Nicki Lowe

Shot: Kathleen Brisbois

Loss: Yolanda Sapp

But experts have hit out at Perry's claim that her former identity was to blame, ABC reported.

'For some people, it's a metaphor: "I was a different person before I came out",' said Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychiatrist.

'It's a certain way that they use the metaphor when transitioning for those who were very unhappy before and now are happy. But it's different when a person makes a claim that somehow they have no linkage to the person they used to be - that would be more of a disturbed presentation.'

Experts also say there is no evidence that hormone therapy in gender treatments helps reduce aggression or violence.

Mystery: The case was cold for more than two decades until Perry was linked to it through DNA evidence

Jack Halberstam, a transgender professor of American and gender studies at University of Southern California, said that Perry's publicized statements are a 'weak defense'.

'Even if we as a person are less aggressive once we resolved a gender disorder, it does not absolve the responsibility of killing three women,' he said.

'As a legal defense, putting away the science, it's absolute nonsense.'

He added: 'Making being transgender into a motivating factor for murder is almost like the horror film, "Dressed to Kill". It feeds directly into the horror stories about gender identity disorder.'
