An international manhunt was launched tonight for the mother of a two-year-old girl found dead in her home.

The child's body was discovered at her semi-detached home after a member of her family became concerned for her welfare and contacted police.

Detectives from Thames Valley Police said they are trying to find the mother, who they believe may have left the country.

An investigation has been launched after the child's body was found in Bicester, Oxfordshire, this morning

Detective Chief Inspector Ian Hunter said: 'We believe the child was in 
the care of her mother at the time of her death and officers are 
currently trying to trace her whereabouts.

'At this time she is thought to have left the United Kingdom.

'We need to speak to the mother to establish the circumstances prior to the discovery of the child's body.'

Tonight, officers were continuing to semi-detached home following the little girl's death, which is being treated as
unexplained.

A post-mortem examination was being carried out tonight to 
establish how the child, who is yet to be formally identified, 
died.

No arrests have been made in connection with the child's death.

Forensics officers in white suits erected a blue tent at the front of 
the property today as they investigated the toddler's 
death.

Superintendent Colin Paine of Thames Valley Police added: 'Incidents of 
this nature are extremely sad and will inevitably be felt throughout the
community.'

James Keating-Wilkes, spokesman for South Central Ambulance Service, 
said the little girl was pronounced dead at the scene.

Shocked neighbours were at a loss as to what had happened at the property or how they failed to hear or see anything before police arrived.

Kevin Marshall, aged 28 years, has lived immediately next door to the sealed-off property for the whole of his life.

He said: 'The first I knew was this morning when the police were turning up. I didn't even know what was going on.

'When
all the barriers started going up I thought it was something serious. 
I've just been looking out the window all day. It's sad, with a 
two-year-old. It's never going to be nice.'

He said of the occupants: 'They lived there for about 10 years and maybe someone else rented it for a year. I don't really know the lady. She kept herself to herself. I said hello to her a few times.'

He said he was aware of her having a child but had not seen a partner.

Paul Rummery-Blackford, who lives nearby, had seen the mother and daughter before.

He said: 'Last year she had a gentleman there, then she moved out and rented the property out. 'I wasn't aware that she was back until she asked me about her car. I'm a part-time mechanic and work from home and she was finding out if I could work on the car.'

She said: 'I've moved back and the tenants have moved out'. She said she was moving on. She seemed quite a bubbly woman. I'm shocked, I really am. I'm shaken up.'

Local mothers returning with their children from school said they only knew of the woman because she would park her car partly blocking the pavement.
'We just saw them driving in and out,' one said.

'Nobody knows what happened and it's left quite a sinister feel on the street but it could be something completely innocent.'

One said she had heard shouting last night but thought it might be her neighbours in their garden. Immediate neighbours of the toddler's home did not report hearing anything untoward.
