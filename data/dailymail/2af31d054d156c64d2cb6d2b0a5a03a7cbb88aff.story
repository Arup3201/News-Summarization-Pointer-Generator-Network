Cancer: Peter Redfern has admitted killing his wife and daughter after reacting badly to cancer drugs, a court has heard

A retired gas fitter dying from cancer strangled his wife and bludgeoned his daughter with a hammer after reacting badly to cancer treatment, a court heard.

Peter Redfern, 70, had lived an exemplary and quiet family life with his wife Jean, 67, and Sarah, 33, at their bungalow home in Wath upon Dearne, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire.

But after he was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer he was put on chemotherapy with a combination of drugs including corticosteroids which can lead to 'drug-induced adverse psychiatric events'.

His barrister Mark George QC told Sheffield Crown Court: 'He was a man who would never have acted in the way he did had it not been for the reaction of the taking of these powerful drugs.'

Redfern admitted the manslaughter of his wife on the grounds of diminished responsibility and the murder of his daughter on July 22 last year.

After killing his wife in the bedroom he lay in wait for his daughter as she came in from work and bludgeoned her to death with a hammer in the kitchen so she could not see her motherâ€™s body.

Redfern wept in the dock and held his head down as the facts of the tragedy unfolded.

Graham Reeds QC, prosecuting, said Redfern had been diagnosed with incurable cancer and it was recognised that using corticosteroids in a small number of cases could lead to 'drug-induced adverse psychiatric events'.

Medical experts had concluded that the pensioner fell into the one per cent of the population who would suffer adversely from such treatment and it was likely to have been reponsible for his behaviour on the day.

He was also suffering from depression and the taking of the Dexamethasone corticosteroids in combination with other drugs 'may explain his conduct in carrying out the killings,' said Mr Reeds.

The couple married in November, 1968, and met when both worked for British Gas in Rotherham before Sarah was born in 1980.

Mr Reeds said: 'They were to all intents a reserved and close-knit family who tended to socialise together rather than with outsiders.'

The family took holidays and day trips together and Mrs Redfern regarded Sarah as her best friend

But in May last year Redfern was told he had incurable bone marrow cancer which is life-threatening and will limit his lifespan.

He was offered chemotherapy and opted to enter a national trial for its treatment with different combinations of recognised drugs to see which was the most efficient in treating the disease.

His trial started on June 3 but he stopped it on July 4 after suffering unpleasant side effects. He started a different trial on July 11 with other drugs but again asked for it to be stopped after just five days.

On July 22, the day of the tragedy, a nurse rang him at home and offered him a clinic appointment to see how they should proceed.

Later that day Redfern rang 999 to say: 'I have just killed my wife and daughter.'

'He was a man who would never have acted 
in the way he did had it not been for the reaction of the taking of 
these powerful drugs'

Police officers found Mrs Redfern dead in he bedroom and Sarah in the kitchen. 'Each woman was found with a plastic bag over her head secured with white elecrical flex wrapped around the neck,' said Mr Reeds.

Mr Redfern had strangled his wife first with the flex and repeatedly hit Sarah with a hammer when she returned home.

When arrested he behaved 'oddly' at the police station but did not appear to be mentally ill and later told a nurse he was 'feeling depressed and anxious and was worrying about his future'.

Mr Reeds said: 'He said that when he realised what he had done to Sarahâ€™s mother he decided he could not leave Sarah to see it and he decided to kill her.'

Mark George, for Redfern said: 'This is a truly tragic case. Less than a year ago having been retired for more than 15 years his life seemed to be a very pleasant one. All in the family seemed completely normal. All of this has come as the most appalling devastating blow to everybody involved in the case.'

He said Mr Redfern ran to keep himself fit but developed back problems and during tests for that he was diagnosed with incurable bone marrow cancer.

He told the nurse who contacted him on the day of the tragedy that he was suffering with sleeplessness, loss of appetite, he felt he was losing weight and was 'feeling jittery'.

Police officers who went to the house described him as 'agitated and pacing around' outside the house.

He had never been able to explain to anyone why he had killed Mrs Redfern.

Mr George said: 'But he has always maintained that the only thing he could think was that it was linked to the treatment he had for cancer. He had absolutely no motive to wish to harm Jean in any way. He acted without any pre-meditation or thought entirely on the spur of the moment.'

He went on: 'He had led an entirely blameless life. It is hard to get away from the feeling that in some way there was something about the effect on him of the treatment for cancer which precipitated this catastrophic chain of events.'

Mr George concluded: 'He knows there is no other alternative than he will die in prison.'

The judge Mr Justice Stephen Males was due to sentence Redfern tomorrow.
