Mrs Justice Parker at the Court of Protection described the 'grossly cruel' ordeal of the woman who has a reading age of seven

A British woman with serious learning difficulties married a Pakistani immigrant and had his baby as part of a plan to help him remain in the UK, a secret court heard.

The 37-year-old woman – who has a reading age of a child of seven – was even slapped around the face by her mother to force her to smile for the wedding photograph.

On the day the couple attended a register office to give notice to marry, an anonymous caller rang the office to allege that her parents had been paid £20,000 to marry off their daughter to the Muslim student.

Incredibly, although registrars were concerned about the ‘demeanour and vulnerability’ of the bride and feared she was being ‘manipulated’ as part of a visa scam, the civil marriage went ahead two months later. By then, the woman was pregnant and she went on give birth to a boy.

Her 33-year-old husband, from Lahore, is now using his human right to a family life to try to stay in the UK, and lawyers expect him to be granted indefinite leave to remain.

The case was heard earlier this year by the Court of Protection, which has the power to make life-or-death decisions on behalf of people deemed to lack mental capacity.

It emerged with the publication of an ‘anonymised’ judgment.

In her ruling, Mrs Justice Parker said: ‘I think there is a very significant possibility that this marriage was entered into, and indeed this child created, for reasons solely to do with immigration status.

‘To inflict pregnancy and childbearing on a person who cannot consent to that state is about as gross a physical interference as can be imagined.

'To put an incapacitated person in a position whereby she bears a child which she cannot look after is grossly cruel.’

The husband’s two-year student visa expired in September 2011. An application for further leave to remain was refused, so he lodged an appeal.

The woman, a Sikh who has converted to Islam, is said to have conceived ‘almost immediately’ after their Muslim wedding that November.

The next month they met registrars about their civil wedding. The registrars contacted the UK Border Agency, describing her as ‘obviously learning disabled’.

She was not sure of her husband’s name and could not remember being twice married and divorced – to a nephew of her stepfather and a maternal cousin respectively.

UKBA informed social services, who objected to the wedding, but it went ahead. A senior registrar was ‘concerned about being seen not to have taken into account the cultural background and [the woman’s] right to marry and found a family, said Mrs Justice Parker.

The child was made the subject of care proceedings after his birth and placed in foster care, with parental contact.

According to the judgment, the woman has a reading age of 7.7 years and a learning disability. It said social services assessment shows she cannot look after her baby safely.

The groom said he was ‘duped’ into marrying the woman by her parents, but now accepts that any ‘pretence that this is or could be a functioning marriage has now evaporated’.

He told the court he wants to be rehoused with the baby in a two-bedroom flat, with social workers visiting for two hours every morning and evening so he can ‘go to the mosque’.

After the judge’s ruling that the woman could not consent to sex, marriage or where she lived, the husband and the baby are likely to be rehoused separately by the council.

He is now thinking of having the marriage annulled.

John Hemming, the Lib Dem MP who campaigns to open up family courts, said: ‘One or more criminal offences have been committed and the registrars or immigration authorities should have reported it to police.’
