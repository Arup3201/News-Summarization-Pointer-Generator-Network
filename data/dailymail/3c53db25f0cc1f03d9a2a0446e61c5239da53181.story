A Melbourne man has prompted concern after offering  women money for sex on the dating site OKCupid.

Daniel, 28, asked several women if they have 'ever been offered money', before naming prices and urging them to consider the offer.

None of the women reported the messages to police, as the messages are not considered illegal in Australia, reports The Age.

On his profile, Daniel said that he was from Melbourne, with the personal description that he was 'extremely unlucky in love and not your average guy.' 

Daniel, who uses the account names dja86dj and daniel86dja, has since deleted the offending OKCupid account.

In all of the proposals towards Melbourne based women, Daniel offered $500 then raised the sum to $1000 then $2000.

One of the women said he had been messaging her intermittently from different accounts for years.

However, none of the women who were messaged by Daniel reported him to police.

A police spokesperson said that no offence had been committed in the messages: in Australia, it is legal to offer money for sex.

Sheila Jeffreys, a professor of feminism and prostitution at Melbourne University, told The Age laws should be tightened up on dating sites.

'Women are in no position to know whether men who they have never met are going to be dangerous to them or not,' she told The Age.

She said Daniel's messages would have been deemed illegal in Ireland, Canada, Sweden and Norway, where it is unlawful to offer money for sex.

OKCupid is owned by the same US company which runs Tinder, Match.com,and Collegehumour.

In March, a 65-year-old New York man sued the OKCupid after he was swindled out of $70,000 by a man he met on the site.
