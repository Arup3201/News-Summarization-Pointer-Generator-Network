Barack Obama's latest campaign gambit follows a familiar line of attack as it uses Mitt Romney's private equity past to cast the Republican candidate as  greedy, job-killing corporate titan with little concern for the working class.

The President is not the first of Mr Romney's opponents to try and paint the former governor of Massachusetts as a heartless uber-capitalist - even his Republican rivals used the same tactic during the heated primary battle.

But Mr Obama's campaign seems to have been particularly unoriginal - as his attack ad is almost identical to one produced by Ted Kennedy for his Senate campaign against Mr Romney in 1994, featuring unemployed workers complaining about Bain Capital, the firm founded by Mr Romney.

The timing of the Obama assault on private equity is also unfortunate, as on Monday night the President attended a fundraiser hosted by Democratic supporter Hamilton E. James, chief operating officer of the Blackstone Group, which is believed to be the world's largest private equity firm.

Mr Obama is opening himself up to 
criticism with the attack ad, given how similar it is to the message put
out by Mr Romney's other opponents over the years - but the message has
proved effective in the past, as it goes right to the heart of the 
candidate's much-touted business credentials.

The same message - that Mr Romney is concerned only with profits and not with the well-being of those people whose jobs he cut - was echoed by his gubernatorial competitor Shannon O'Brien in 2002, and then even by his Republican opponents Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich earlier this year.

At the center of the Obama camp's push - the 
president's most forceful attempt yet to sully Romney before the 
November election - is a biting new TV ad airing on Monday that recounts 
through interviews with former workers the restructuring, and ultimate 
demise, of a Kansas City, Missouri, steel mill under the Republican's 
private equity firm.

‘They made as much money off of it as they could. And they closed it down,’ says Joe Soptic, a steelworker for 30 years.

Jack Cobb, who also worked in the 
industry for three decades, adds: ‘It was like a vampire. They came in 
and sucked the life out of us.’

The
ad, running for an unusually long two minutes, will air in five 
battleground states: Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado.

The
campaign declined to describe the size of the ad buy though it's in the
middle of running a $25million, month-long ad campaign in nine states. A
longer version of the ad was being posted online Monday.

The commercial will 
be coupled with a series of events Mr Obama's campaign is holding this 
week in Florida, Missouri, Iowa, Nevada and North Carolina to highlight 
Mr Romney's role at Bain Capital, a company he co-founded.

It's
unclear whether Mr Obama, himself, will criticize his Republican rival 
on the subject when the president appears at events in New York on 
Monday or whether he'll leave the skewering to campaign surrogates as he
prepares to meet with foreign leaders during the G-8 and NATO summits 
later this week.

Also this 
week, Vice President Joe Biden holds two days of events in Ohio, where 
he's expected to discuss Mr Romney's role as a corporate buyout 
specialist.

Under fire: The ad focuses on Bain Capital's work with GST Steel beginning in 1993, and eventually the company filed for bankruptcy in 2001

Lasting impact: About 750 workers lost their jobs, and were left without any health benefits and reduced pension

The Romney campaign did not comment on the ad early Monday.

The
former Massachusetts governor was spending the day in Boston, with no 
public events scheduled, after delivering a commencement speech in 
Virginia on Saturday.

Mr Obama's new ad, which reprises 
criticism leveled at Mr Romney during the Republican primaries, focuses 
on one of those unsuccessful companies, GST Steel.

Bain
was the majority shareholder in GST Steel beginning in 1993. The 
company eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2001, which was a period in 
which the U.S. steel industry was roiled by a flood of cheap steel 
imports.

About 750 workers lost their jobs, and
were left without any health benefits and reduced pensions. The federal
government was forced to infuse $44million into the company's 
underfunded pension plan.

Bain
received $12million on its $8million initial investment and at least 
$4.5million in consulting fees, according to a January report by 
Reuters.

Mr 
Romney has accused Mr Obama of attacking free enterprise and called the 
criticism of his business background an attempt by Democrats to distract
voters from the president's record.

Both candidates were entering a new week in the campaign seeking to shift the focus back to voters' No. 1 issue- the economy- from social issues that dominated after the president announced his support for gay marriage.

The two campaigns contend that in a nation where unemployment is hovering around 8 per cent, voters will choose between Mr Obama and Mr Romney based on economic arguments. Obama is trying to convince voters to stick with him as he heralds an economic rebound, as sluggish as it is.

Mr Romney counters that Mr Obama has had enough time, and only he - with his deep background in business - knows how to jumpstart the nation's job market.

Mr Obama, hosting his first campaign rally earlier this month in Columbus, Ohio, gave a preview of the new line of attack, saying Mr Romney had ‘drawn the wrong lessons’ from his business experience at the helm of Bain.

‘He doesn't seem to understand that maximizing profits by whatever means necessary - whether through layoffs or outsourcing or tax avoidance or union-busting - might not always be good for the average American or for the American economy,’ Mr Obama said then.

Mr Romney, a multimillionaire, left Bain 
in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympic Games but maintained a 
financial interest in the company after departing.

He has said that his firm had a strong overall track record, creating jobs in prominent companies like Staples and Sports Authority, while acknowledging that some companies Bain invested in were unsuccessful.

Mr Obama's new ad, which reprises criticism leveled at Mr Romney during the Republican primaries, focuses on one of those unsuccessful companies, GST Steel.

Bain was the majority shareholder in GST Steel beginning in 1993. The company eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2001, which was a period in which the U.S. steel industry was roiled by a flood of cheap steel imports.

About 750 workers lost their jobs, and
were left without any health benefits and reduced pensions. The federal
government was forced to infuse $44million into the company's 
underfunded pension plan.

Bain
received $12million on its $8million initial investment and at least 
$4.5million in consulting fees, according to a January report by 
Reuters.

The commercial 
shows interviews with former workers at the Kansas City plant who said 
Bain's role led to job losses and slashed benefits.

It
intersperses their claims with clips of Romney promoting his business 
background and empathizing with the jobless during campaign events.

There also are images of a closed factory, run-down buildings and a road sign that says ‘Dead End.’

‘Bain Capital walked away with a lot of money that they made off this plant. We view Mitt Romney as a job destroyer,’ said steel worker John Wiseman.

David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr Obama's campaign, said Mr Romney wants to ‘create the illusion that somehow his experience equips him to lead the economy but there's nothing about the record that would support that.’

‘His central premise is that he's an economic wizard who can really get this economy moving and if that's the only claim he is making for this office, that's a premise worth examining,’ Mr Axelrod said.

During a commencement address at Barnard College, a private women's college, President Obama urged the graduates to fight for their place at 'the head of the table' and help lead a country still battered by economic woes toward brighter days. Obama said 'I believe that the women of this generation will help lead the way.

Women, young people and gay voters all made up crucial voting blocs for Mr Obama in the 2008 election. And with the president locked in a close race with Republican rival Mitt Romney, his campaign is focused on rallying support among those groups once again.

The president's choice of Barnard as his first commencement address of the spring underscored the intense focus both candidates have placed on women. An Associated Press-GfK poll conducted earlier this month showed Mr Obama with a sizable advantage over Mr Romney with women voters, 54 per cent to 39 per cent.

Mr Obama acknowledged that today's college graduates are entering a shaky job market. But to those who say overcoming the nation's challenges isn't possible, Obama said: 'Don't believe it.'

He told the graduates that if they ever despair, they should think of the country's history and what young generations before them have achieved.

'Young folks who marched and mobilized and stood up and sat in from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall they didn't just do it for themselves, they did it for other people,' Mr Obama said. 'That's how we achieved women's rights, that's how we achieved voting rights, that's how we achieved workers' rights, that's how we achieved gay rights, that's how we've made this union more perfect.'
