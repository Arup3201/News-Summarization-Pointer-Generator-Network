Christian Benteke will not be sold by Aston Villa even if a bid of £25million comes in for the Belgium striker, Paul Lambert has insisted.

The Villa manager is adamant Benteke will stay to aid his low-scoring side’s fight against relegation – even with owner Randy Lerner open to selling the club.

Benteke is Villa’s most prized asset and has been a target for Tottenham and Liverpool.

Asked if he was worried Lerner might accept a big offer this window, Lambert said: 'No chance.'

He added: 'Twenty-five million? That’s for his left boot that one. Listen, there is no way and I am pretty sure Randy will be totally fine.'

Benteke has only scored three times in 15 games this season after missing six months with a ruptured achilles, but remains one of the Premier League’s most-wanted centre-forwards. Top-six clubs are expected to explore the possibility of luring him away from Villa Park this summer.

The 24-year-old, signed for £7m from Genk in 2012, remains vital to Villa’s ambitions of staying up. The team have only found the net 11 times in 22 Premier League games.

Lambert said he was looking at the bringing in another striker this month but laughed off any suggestion Villa had countenanced Jermain Defoe, whose £80,000-per-week wages are far beyond their pay scale.

‘A top, top striker in football now you are talking, £10m, £15m-plus,’ said Lambert. 'I knew we weren’t going to do these sort of things. I had to respect Randy’s way and there is no problem – that is the way the club is.'

Libor Kozak, in action against Crystal Palace in December 2013, has been recovering from a broken leg

Libor Kozak was bought for £6m in 2013 to support Benteke but has been out for a year with a broken leg. Lambert was unable to say whether the Czech Republic international, who has experienced setbacks in his recovery, would play again this season.

'He is running. We need to sit and discuss [moving on to ball work] but for the horrific break it was, he is doing well,’ said Lambert. 

'We have to wait and be guided by him and the medical people on how he is doing.'
