It is a special day in middle America when you step out of your front door and bump into the sister of British loyalty.

But that was exactly what happened to nine-year-old Cayman Terbroc, who met a lycra clad Pippa Middleton who had stopped for a pit stop to change riders in Missouri during her Race Across America challenge.

An athletic looking Pippa was happy to pose for pictures and chatted with Cayman and her mother Lisa, before asking them to help her cheer on her brother James, who is taking part in the race with her, as he rode past them.

The 30-year-old looked every inch the professional cyclist in her patriotic get-up of a blue, white and red lycra all in one, with sunglasses to help shield her eyes from the glaring sun.

The Duchess of Cambridge's little sister also seemed to have topped up her tan during her challenge, sporting a healthy golden glow.

She is only part way through her 3,000 mile ride across the United States as part of the Race Across America challenge.

The charity ride kicked off in Oceanside, California, on Saturday, and the six participants are expected to arrive in Annapolis, Maryland, next Thursday.

The Route: Race Across America takes place across 12 days, with cyclists venturing from Oceanside, California to Annapolis, Maryland

She will be joined by a team including her brother James, 27, and six other individuals, in aid of the Michael Matthews Foundation and the British Heart Foundation, according to People.com.

The ‘ultra-endurance’ event promises to be a challenge even for ultra-fit Miss Middleton, who regularly takes part in charity races. In the race’s 32-year-history less than 200 individuals have successfully completed the event. 

Pippa, 30 and James, 27, appeared upbeat about the enormous challenge ahead of them before they set off on Saturday

The cyclists will climb more than 100,000 vertical feet over the course of the route, and will likely be biking on very little sleep in order to reach the finish within 12 days.

Pippa and her fellow cyclists are raising money for the Michael Matthews Foundation is an educational charity, though it not known how much they have collected.

Like her older sister, Pippa has always been a keen sportswoman, enjoying numerous sports at school and taking part in an endurance ski race in Switzerland in 2012.

She also participated in the Highland Cross in 2011 – a fell run that is held in Scotland.
