A former Royal Marine has earned himself a place in the record books for freediving after reaching a lung-busting depth of 315ft - the same height as Big Ben.

Mike Board, 40, held his breath for an incredible two minutes and 52 seconds to claim the title for the deepest freedive ever carried out by a Brit.

And he went on to plunge to an even deeper depth of 100m in another dive but was disqualified when his nose clip fell off.

Deep breath: Mike Board made his mark on British freediving by taking the record for Free Immersion at a recent event in the Bahamas 

Record breaker: For the British record-breaking dive, Mr Board held his breath for an incredible two minutes and 52 seconds under water

The diver, from London, claimed the British record during the recent free diving championships held in the Caribbean off the Bahamas.

Wearing a wetsuit and flippers, he used a rope to guide himself through the water in a straight line.

He explained that diving to such depths puts so much pressure on the lungs and muscles that competitors are prone to blacking out.

He said: 'The air in your lungs gets really compressed.

'At about 40 metres down the lungs are crushed until they are about a quarter of their size and blood then enters them, protects them and stops them from getting smaller.

'You really aren't worried about having enough oxygen to get back to the surface, its more about not blacking out.

Nearly there: Mr Board makes his way back to the surface following his enormous dive down into the water

'The more you dive the more you condition yourself to it.

'The
competition was in the Bahamas so it was a long way to go but you are 
surrounded by world class divers and you get quite a few opportunities 
to dive.

'My first dive didn't go very well but I got my head together and after that every dive felt easier.

'As
soon as I broke the record of 91 metres and made it to 92 metres the 
pressure was off and it was relatively straight-forward from there to 
get to 96 metres.

Pressure: Mr Board said after 40 metres down, the lungs are crushed until they are about a quarter of their normal size

'It would have been nice to get 100m, which I did do, but my nose clip came off and rules are rules.

'It was an immense relief to get the British record. You try and tell yourself it doesn't matter but I had built it up because this record was the one I wanted.'

Mike, who now runs a diving school in Indonesia with his girlfriend Kate, became interested in free diving while working as a scuba diving instructor.

He used to get into contests with his friends to see who could hold their breath the longest and found he was quite good at it.

He said: 'I wanted to do more of it and learned to become a freediving instructor. I've been doing if for four-and-a-half-years now.'

The previous British free dive record of 91 metres was held by Dave King, a geography teacher from Brighton who set it in 2009.

The world record holder for free immersion diving is William Trubidge, from, New Zealand, which stands at 121 metres.

Mr Board dived 315ft - which is the same height as Big Ben
