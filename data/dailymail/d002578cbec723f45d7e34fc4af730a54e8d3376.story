Jesse Jackson Jr, the son of Reverend Jesse Jackson and former congressman, has been moved prisons after he was locked in solitary confinement following a dispute with prison officials, it has been claimed.

A guard at the federal prison in North Carolina where the 49-year-old has been held since October reportedly took exception to him advising fellow inmates about their rights.

Jackson, who was a Democratic congressman from 1995 until he resigned in November 2012, was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison last August after pleading guilty to illegally spending $750,000 in campaign funds on personal items.

Jackson's transfer reportedly transpired after he was placed in solitary confinement for four days last month following a dispute with a guard, a source told The Chicago Sun-Times.

A hearing cleared him of any wrongdoing and Jackson asked for a transfer. He has now been moved to the prison camp at Maxwell Air Force Base, in Alabama.

He is now listed on the Bureau of Prisons' website as an inmate at the Montgomery facility.

Family members confirmed the move to The Chicago Sun-Times on Saturday.

His father, the Rev Jesse Jackson, told The Chicago Tribune that his son's spirits were 'great'.

'He's been writing and teaching and honoring his medical regime,' he said. Jackson has been treated previously for bipolar disorder.

At the time of his sentencing last year, Jackson, who emotionally apologised to his father, mother, congressional colleagues and others, was given less prison time than federal guidelines recommended.

The judge recognised him as a 'complex person' who had done both good and bad.

His wife Sandra Jackson, a former Chicago alderman, was sentenced for filing false joint federal income tax returns.

She will serve her time once her husband is released.

According to court documents, the Jacksons had spent campaign money on TVs, restaurant dinners, an expensive watch and other costly personal items.
