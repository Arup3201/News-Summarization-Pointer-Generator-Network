Ever since he won the lottery three years ago, Lucien Nault's life has been plagued by calamities, from legal battles to the breakup of his marriage.

And now the 77-year-old retired taxi driver from Montreal has suffered a double blow when his son and daughter-in-law passed away just weeks apart.

Mr Nault hit the jackpot in March 2009, vowing to ‘spoil his family’ with the $16.9million prize from the 6-49 lottery, but instead of happiness and stability, the money has brought nothing but misery to the elderly man’s life, tearing his family apart.

On Tuesday, the Edmonton Sun
 reported that the lottery winner's son, Daniel, was struck and killed 
in a car crash as he ran out of his yard in a Montreal suburb to catch 
his runaway dog.

The 
tragedy comes less than three weeks after Daniel's wife was found dead 
in the pool the two had built at their home in the Gaspe region.

The
 untimely deaths of the couple were just the latest in a series of 
misfortunes Lucien Nault has faced since the day he held the oversized 
check in his hands.

Daniel was furious with his father for giving away $5million of the prize money to his neighbors.

Tragedy: His death comes less than three weeks after his wife drowned

This
 spring, he sued four neighbors and a relative of his father's 
ex-wife, claiming that they took advantage of the elderly man whose mind
 has been fading lately, and who is 'a total invalid,' according to 
court filings.

The 
lawsuit alleges that one neighbor manipulated the elder Mr Nault into 
buying her a $300,000 house and a Mini Cooper valued at $35,000, among 
other costly gifts.

Daniel also sued Roger Thibodeau, brother-in-law of his father's wife who had left him just months after the lucky win.

Meanwhile, the son and his wife, Therese Rehel, who had received a large portion of the jackpot, continued to enjoy their new-found wealth, building a luxurious pool complete with floodlights and stonework at their home in Lavaltrie, Quebec.

The couple celebrated the completion of the months-long construction project with friends, and days later, on September 2, Therese Rehel Nault was found dead under water in the pool of her dreams.

On Tuesday, the lottery curse claimed another victim in the Nault family when Daniel was killed after bolting into the path of an oncoming Jeep.
