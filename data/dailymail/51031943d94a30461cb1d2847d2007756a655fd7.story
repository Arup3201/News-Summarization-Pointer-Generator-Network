A lapdancer who was earning £150 a night in a strip club carried on claiming benefits - even after she had won thousands in a radio contest.

Nikita Baker, of Blackpool, Lancashire, collected £10,000 in cash when she answered a question about Australia on a radio station's phone-in quiz.

The mother-of-one pleaded guilty to three offences of failing to notify the authorities of a change in her circumstances.

She was sentenced to 40 hours unpaid work and ordered to pay a £60 victims' surcharge by Magistrates in Blackpool.

Pam Smith, prosecuting, said benefit fraud investigators received a tip-off about Baker and started to look into her lifestyle.

They followed her to a club in Carlisle, Cumbria, where she did lap and pole dancing earning £150 a night, the court heard.

Investigators also found out she had won £10,000 in July last year by answering a question correctly on a radio station. 

When she was formally interviewed she admitted how much she earned as a dancer and said she believed she could work sixteen hours a week without disclosing it to the Department of Work and Pensions or her local council.

She admitted her winnings saying she spent the money on a new car and gave some to her boyfriend.

Baker illegally claimed £3,843 in income support, council tax and housing benefit in a one year period.

Suzanne Mugford, defending, said her client had co-operated with the investigation.

'She bought the car because she is her mother's carer and needs to drive to her mum's address,' said the lawyer.
