A rioter has been evicted from his council flat exactly two years after he looted a bank during the London violence.

It is believed to be the first successful eviction carried out in relation to the riots.

Jonathan Mason, 37, joined a mob to burgle the HSBC branch in Lavender Hill, Battersea, south London, on August 8th, 2011. He was convicted of burglary and jailed for three years in 2012.

Wandsworth Council, which owns Mason’s flat in Fontley Way, Roehampton, started proceedings to evict him following his conviction.

Punishment: Jonathan Mason, 37, is the first person to be evicted as a result of his part in the London riots of 2011

Anniversary: His eviction, thought to be the first in connection with the riots, happened two years on from the trouble itself

After a ‘lengthy legal process’ an eviction order was granted in July this year on the grounds that he had breached his tenancy agreement. He was also ordered to pay off £5,695 in rent arrears.

Mason had 28 days to appeal - but that time ran out yesterday.

He is believed to still be serving his sentence and the eviction took place in his absence.

Wandsworth housing spokesman Councillor Paul Ellis said: 'Mr Mason’s decision to involve himself in the shocking scenes of violence, looting and disorder that struck Clapham Junction in August 2011, coupled with his wilful refusal to pay his rent, has resulted in him losing his council flat.

'As a consequence, it is extremely unlikely he will be offered taxpayer subsidised social housing by any other council or housing association. He will have to stand on his own two feet and arrange his own accommodation from now on.

'This is the price he must pay for his actions that night.

'The date of today’s eviction is nothing more than pure coincidence, but it does serve as a timely reminder that here in this borough we make no apology whatsoever for taking a tough stance with those who choose to engage in serious criminality.

'We have no room on our estates for looters, rioters and those who refuse to pay their rent.'

A council spokesman said: 'When a tenant is given the keys to a council property in Wandsworth they must sign a binding agreement that neither they nor any of their household members will engage in criminal or anti-social behaviour anywhere in the borough, or commit any acts that that cause fear, harassment or nuisance to other people living in the area.

'Failure to abide by this tenancy agreement renders them liable to eviction.

'In parallel, the council’s finance department was also seeking Mr Mason’s removal from the property as a result of his rent arrears, which now stand at £5,695.

'The judge ordered Mr Mason to pay these off without delay.'
