Extraordinary coincidence: Convicted paedophile Andrew Sadler (pictured in 2012) taught at schools attended by David Cameron, Prince Edward and 'psycho' banker Rurik Jutting

A convicted paedophile who was caught in bed with two child prostitutes in Romania taught at schools attended by David Cameron, Prince Edward - and 'psycho' banker Rurik Jutting.

In an astonishing coincidence, MailOnline can reveal that Andrew Sadler, who was jailed after abusing two 15-year-old boys, was a teacher at prestigious boarding schools where the prime minister, princes Andrew and Edward, and the trader accused of murdering two sex workers in Hong Kong were all pupils.

Sadler was also a member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) - a vile web of perverts that at one stage was linked to three of Labour's most senior figures, including deputy leader Harriet Harman.

He taught French at £6,600-a-term Abberley Hall in Worcestershire when Jutting was a pupil in the early 1990s.

Sadler had previously taught at the prestigious Heatherdown Preparatory School near Ascot, Berks, now closed, and is even pictured in a school photograph with a young David Cameron and Prince Edward in 1977.

In one image from his time at Heatherdown, Sadler stands just a row in front of a ten-year-old David Cameron in 1976-77.

Sadler taught French and Spanish and was also one of the staff members charged with keeping an eye on boys during dormitory duty.

There is no suggestion any abuse happened at Heatherdown, which closed down in 1982 while Sadler was standing in as headteacher.

Prince Edward attended Heatherdown for five years until 1977, when he was 13, while David Cameron spent five years at the school before leaving in 1979 for Eton.

It is not known if Sadler taught Mr Cameron or Prince Edward directly - although he was at the school at the same time.

Sadler (seen, left in 1994) went on to teach Rurik Jutting (pictured, right, being driven to court accused of murder in Hong Kong) at Abberley Hall, where he was reported to police and took 'early retirement' in 1995

Rhidian Llewellyn, an education consultant and former teacher at Heatherdown, told MailOnline: 'I can confirm the Andrew Sadler who taught at Heatherdown was later convicted [of child abuse]. 

'I was absolutely shocked. I can't confirm if he directly taught them [David Cameron and Prince Edward], but it was a small school, about 80 or 90 boys. 

'There was no suggestion anything went on at the school though.'   

Former pupil Alexander Bathurst said: 'I remember him [Sadler] very well, he taught me for at least a couple of years. I was an awful student and he was an extremely competent teacher.'

Mr Bathurst, now a life skills and leadership consultant from Cirencester, Gloucestershire, said Sadler stood in as head shortly after he had left and before the school closed in 1982.

'Mr Sadler would have certainly taught David Cameron and Prince Edward.

'Cameron was in the year below me and Prince Andrew in the year above,' he said.

'The majority of the teachers in those days were generalists and Mr Sadler taught just about every subject in the curriculum.'  

Sadler taught French at £6,600-a-term Abberley Hall (above) when Jutting was a pupil there in the early 1990s

He says Sadler taught English, Latin and Geography and history.

'He also took us in sports: rugby, cricket, football, I remember he loved cricket and he umpired the games.'  He said he was 'extremely surprised' at the later conviction. 

It also emerged today that Sadler went on to teach Rurik Jutting at Abberley Hall boarding school in Worcestershire, where he was reported to police and took 'early retirement' in 1995.

Jutting is accused of slaughtering two prostitutes in Hong Kong last week in an unexplained act of savagery.

While Sadler was never charged with abusing any children at Abberley - and there has been no suggestion that Jutting was among his victims - he was convicted in 2000 in Romania.

He was found guilty of having sex with a 14-year-old boy and engaging in an obscene act in the presence of a juvenile in Romania after being caught in bed with two under-age male prostitutes.

They were found in a squalid property which had been covered with newspapers to stop anyone looking inside. It was then that his sickening double-life was finally exposed.

British police who helped the Romanians convict him described Sadler as a key member of a network of public school paedophiles.

He was described as the 'quartermaster' of PIE – it was his 'job' to help co-ordinate other abusers in their ceaseless search for the world's most vulnerable children. 

Police believe Sadler – who confessed to a colleague of having 'sex with hundreds and hundreds' of boys – was an associate of PIE leaders including its treasurer Charles Napier and founder-member Morris Fraser.

PIE, which in the 1970s lobbied for sex between adults and children to be decriminalised, helped paedophiles to secretly pass around their young victims.

Sadler, who now lives 100 yards from another prep school, told the Mail: 'Yes, I was a teacher at Abberley, but I don't know [Jutting]. I didn't teach him and I don't recognise him from the photograph.'

Asked about his paedophile activities, he said: 'It has all been a terrible misunderstanding. I have been fighting to clear my name for 14 years.

'I am the subject of a SOPO [Sexual Offences Prevention Order] which prevents me from associating with boys under 18 and I have to notify the police if I leave the country.'  

From angelic schoolboy to bloated 'zombie' banker: Rurik Jutting pictured aged six at Wallop Preparatory School in Weybridge, Surrey in 1990 (left) and (right) while working as an investment trader in Hong Kong

'Not he most popular kid in the school': A former classmate at Wallop Preparatory School in Weybridge, Surrey said Jutting (second right, middle row) was 'a bit of a strange chap' in his days at the school

He said he had previously visited other countries including Hong Kong, adding: 'I have been to all over that part of the world as a teacher.

'There is a lot of poverty, which is why a lot of these girls go into prostitution - I have to say with their parents' knowledge.'

He spent 16 months of a four-year sentence in jail in Romania before being deported back to Britain on medical grounds.

In 2007, he then breached an interim court order not to have children under 18 at his home after he allowed a 15-year-old to smoke cannabis, drink beer and stay overnight.

Worcester Crown Court heard Sadler had employed an 18-year-old gardener who brought the youth along to his house.

In a failed attempt to appeal the ban, Sadler maintained he was only 'helping' a vulnerable boy who was having problems with his parents, it was reported by Worcester News at the time. 

Sadler had claimed the order was 'unjust' telling the court: 'I have never gone near a child in my life.

'I'm not a paedophile and think the whole subject is abhorrent. I was helping the boy purely out of compassion.' 

'Can still feel her presence': Seneng  in a photograph from the family album. Her parents said she 'a lovely girl' who always helped around the house when she was still at school and later on the family's coconut plantation

Quashing his appeal, Judge Andrew Geddes said: 'It is highly probable the boy was at his home to be groomed for sexual ventures. It is a very similar situation to the one in Romania.'

Sadler was subsequently given a full SOPO that also banned him from working with children under 16.

Details of Sadler's links to Jutting emerged after the British trader was accused of slaughtering two prostitutes in Hong Kong last week in an unexplained act of savagery.

Speaking to the Mail yesterday, Michael Haggard, former headmaster of Abberley Hall, said: 'There was never any suggestion that Sadler had done anything wrong while at the school.

'I have no reason to think that anything happened.'

He described Jutting as 'a highly intelligent and respected chap', adding: 'He excelled in academics but he also did a lot of other things. 

Seneng, also known as Jesse Lorena (pictured posing with cash) was found by police with her throat slashed at Jutting's apartment

'He played musical instruments and was in lots of sport teams. He got on well with his peers and teachers.

'He was very intelligent and got a scholarship to Winchester College, which is not a terribly easy thing to do.'

Police in Hong Kong are expected to carry out a video reconstruction of the alleged murders at Cambridge-educated Jutting's high-rise apartment in the near future.

The former Merrill Lynch banker has been asked to take part in the exercise, ahead of his next court appearance on Monday.

A spokesman for the princes said: 'It's in the public domain that and Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were both educated at Heatherdown Preparatory School. 

'I don't have any further information.' 

MailOnline has also contacted David Cameron for comment.
