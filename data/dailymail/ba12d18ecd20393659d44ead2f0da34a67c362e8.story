Zlatan Ibrahimovic has apologised for any offence caused by his outburst following Paris St Germain's defeat to Bordeaux - but claims his words have been 'twisted'.

Ibrahimovic is facing an investigation by the French football league (LFP) for comments made as he left the field on Sunday.

The Sweden striker's two goals were not enough to prevent PSG suffering a 3-2 defeat and he was angry not to be awarded a free-kick by referee Lionel Jaffredo after Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso picked up a clear backpass from defender Ludovic Sane with five minutes remaining.

As he walked off the field Ibrahimovic - no stranger to making controversial remarks - was filmed venting his anger.

Speaking in English but in partial sentences, he can be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.'

An LFP statement on Monday read: 'Following the receipt of the officials' report, the disciplinary commission of the LFP will study in its meeting of Thursday March 19 the comments made by Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the end of the game between Girondins de Bordeaux and Paris St Germain (29th round of Ligue 1).'

French sports minister Patrick Kanner called on the Swede to apologise, which he later did in a post on his Instagram account.

And talking to PSG's website on Monday evening, Ibrahimovic reiterated: 'First of all, I was not aiming for the people.

'When I said it, I was angry at that moment. Whoever felt offended, or took it in the wrong way, I apologise.

'I have no problem with that. I'm a man of honour, I stand by my things I do, and I apologise.

'I think that whoever saw it, or however the media is trying to twist it, I think the French people are intelligent enough to understand the situation.

'The welcome I have had here, I'm very happy. I respect people who respect me, every day I go through here I've had a fantastic time.

'I have no regrets and nobody will change my opinion. From the first day I came, I had a good time and I will continue to have a good time.

'So don't twist it, it's about football we talk, so let's focus on the football. The football here is the most important (thing) for me.'

Ibrahimovic's comments towards Jaffredo come less than a week after he was sent off in his side's Champions League victory over Chelsea and accused the Blues' players of acting like 'babies' after they surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers.

Ibrahimovic had previously accused Chelsea of acting like 'babies' during their Champions League defeat

Injured team-mate Serge Aurier faces UEFA disciplinary action after labelling Kuipers a 'dirty son of a bitch' in a video posted on Facebook, and the two incidents prompted a response from France's elite referees organisation SAFE (Syndicat des Arbitres du Football d'Elite).

An open letter from SAFE president Stephane Lannoy on the organisation's website read: 'We thought we had seen a peak in media outcry after Chelsea-PSG. We thought we had heard everything. But no.

'Sunday night, for a back-pass, we had a new outburst of hatred and verbal abuse. The equation is simple: back-pass = worst referee in 15 years = s*** country.

'After Mr Kuipers on Wednesday (from what country...?), Mr Jaffredo on Sunday - and ultimately, as the cup was not yet full, the whole of France.'

The letter concluded: 'It is time to realise we cannot say anything, do anything and accept anything. It is high time that finally, in football, everyone recognises the status of the referee and accepts and respects it.'

Ibrahimovic has been told he should leave France by the nation's far right National Front leader Marine Le Pen. 

The National Front Leader told France Info Radio: 'Those who consider that France is a s*** country can leave it. It's as simple as that.'
