Whitney Tilson, the outspoken founder of Kase Capital, posted a blog online regarding sex advice to his young daughters

A New York hedge fund manager has undoubtedly mortified his young daughters after recommending in a blog post that they bite the penis of any man who pressures them for oral sex.

Whitney Tilson, the outspoken founder of Kase Capital, also added that he would buy his first gun if he ever discovered that someone had coerced one of his girls into a sexual act.

Tilson posted the column on his blog in response to a New York Times article about college 'hookup' culture and the prevalence of casual sex on campus. 

'How can so many smart young women be so massively stupid?!' Tilson wrote with a link to the Times story. 'Getting drunk and/or hooking up regularly is such a bad idea in so many ways, especially at such a young age and especially for young women.'

Tilson is married with three young daughters, two of whom are teenagers.

Referring to a part of the article where a young woman recalled being ordered by a man to 'get down on [her] knees,' Tilson writes, 'I certainly hope that my daughters would never spend a second with a guy who would ever dare say “get down on your knees."'

'But if that happened,' he continued, 'they would: a) walk away b) better yet, punch him in the mouth and walk away c) better yet, kick him in the balls and walk away d) better yet, pretend to go along with it, but when he pulls it out, squint, laugh, and walk away e) better yet, bite it!'

After either injuring the man or embarrassing him (or both), Tilson advises his daughters to 'come home and tell me his name so I can by my first gun and ... well you get the idea!'

Tilson's advice, which was first reported by Business Insider, won wide praise on Twitter.

'Amen!' tweeted CNBC anchor Melissa Lee.

'This guy is freaking awesome,' added Sean Aday, a professor at George Washington University.

The managing editor of CNBC.com, Allen Wastler, tweeted, 'As the father of twin girls, couldn't agree with Whitney Tilson more.

Tilson told the New York Post that the bulk of responses to his post were from 'parents agreeing with my reaction.'

But a handful of people also asked to be removed from a listserv that he emails regularly regarding education news. (He had sent the post to the listserv in addition to publishing it to his blog).

Below is a copy of Tilman's blog post, entitled: 'Hookups Replace Dating on College Campuses.' MailOnline has shortened Tilman's excerpts from the New York Times article, but otherwise the post is reprinted in full.

'Hookups Replace Dating on College Campuses

A truly horrifying story from the front page of tomorrow’s NYT (especially if you have three daughters, the oldest two of which are teenagers).

How can so many smart young women be so massively stupid?! Getting drunk and/or hooking up regularly is such a bad idea in so many ways, especially at such a young age and especially for young women.

[From the Times:] It is by now pretty well understood that traditional dating in college has mostly gone the way of the landline, replaced by “hooking up” — an ambiguous term that can signify anything from making out to oral sex to intercourse — without the emotional entanglement of a relationship.

Hookups can lead to things like this:

In November of Haley’s freshman year, a couple of months after her first tentative “Difmos,” or dance-floor makeouts, she went to a party with a boy from her floor. She had too much to drink, and she remembered telling him that she wanted to go home.

Instead, she said, he took her to his room and had sex with her while she drifted in and out of consciousness.

....

A friend of hers, Kristy... had been making out with a guy at his house, not sure how far she wanted to go, when he stood up and told her, “Get down on your knees.”

At first she froze. “I was really taken aback, because I was like, no one has ever said that to me before,” she said. Then he said something like, “ ‘I think that’s fair,’ ” she recalled. When she still hesitated, he pushed her down.

“It was at that point that I was like, ‘I’ll just do it,’ ” she said. “'I was like, 'It will be over soon enough.'"

I certainly hope that my daughters would never spend a second with a guy who would ever dare say “get down on your knees” – but if that happened, they would:

a) walk away

b) better yet, punch him in the mouth and walk away

c) better yet, kick him in the balls and walk away

d) better yet, pretend to go along with it, but when he pulls it out, squint, laugh, and walk away

e) better yet, bite it!

Lastly, after doing any of a-e, come home and tell me his name so I can buy my first gun and...well, you get the idea! ;-)

It’s good to see that at least some women have some good sense – and very interesting that it’s more likely to be those from “modest” (i.e., low income) backgrounds:

At colleges nationally, by senior year, 4 in 10 students are either virgins or have had intercourse with only one person, according to the Online College Social Life Survey. Nearly 3 in 10 said that they had never had a hookup in college.

....

[Researchers have] found that the women from wealthier 
backgrounds were much more likely to hook up, more interested in 
postponing adult responsibilities and warier of serious romantic 
commitment than their less-affluent classmates.
