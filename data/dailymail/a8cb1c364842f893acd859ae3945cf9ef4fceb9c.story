Martha Lane Fox is to become the youngest woman in the House of Lords, when she becomes Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho

Web guru Martha Lane Fox's initiation into the House of Lords got off to a shaky start today, when she pre-empted announcing her official title and joked online that she would not be entitled to 'free nipple tassels'.

Announcing her appointment as a crossbench peer, she vowed to ‘shake things up’ on the red benches.

But the co-founder of travel site Lastminute.com jumped the gun in announcing her title would be Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho, as she also joked the peerage would secure ‘free cocktails and nipple tassels’.

The 40-year-old told her 49,000 
Twitter followers she could not wait to ‘get [her] robe on and get them 
moving’ as she joked about becoming the first member of the Lords to 
include Soho in their title.

She told one user: ‘Don’t think it gets me a discount in Chinatown or late night bar entry but…’

But when another person told her it was a ‘cool title’ she responded: ‘Get free cocktails and nipple tassles right?'

After MailOnline published the tweet, she deleted it, insisting it 'was joke to friend'.

She added: 'To take tweet not for everyone and use it trivialises v serious privilege I feel.'

When journalist James Lyons pointed out a 'certain irony in web guru and HMG adviser complaining that they didn't think Tweets were public, she replied: 'Just was worried cos such a privilege don't want to make light of it as u can imagine.'

In a bizarre twist, Lords rules mean 
she must add a hyphen to her surname, to change from Martha Lane Fox to
officially take up the title of Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho when she is introduced in the Lords on March 26.

Asked by one Twitter follower if she planned to ‘shake things up’ she replied: ‘Hell yeah’.

Baroness Lane-Fox will be joined in the 
upper chamber by composer and BBC Radio 3 presenter  Michael Berkeley, the 
independent House of Lords Appointments Commission said.

Mr Berkeley said: 'Naturally I feel very honoured to be appointed to the House of Lords and I am particularly pleased that the Appointments Commission was keen to increase representation in the field of music and the arts.'

The new peer used Twitter to release a picture of the letter from the Lords authorities confirming her ennoblement

Lane Fox co-founded Lastminute.com in 
1998, selling it in 2005. She went on to set up the karaoke club chain 
Lucky Voice and Go On UK, a charity that aims to teach people about 
using the internet.

She is also a non-executive director of Marks and Spencer and the Women's Prize for Fiction.

In
2009 she was appointed the UK Government’s digital champion, and has 
worked closely with both the Labour and coalition governments.

The youngest member of the Lords is Tory Big Society guru, who was born on 19 January 1977.

Having
turned 40 on February 10 this year, Baroness Lane Fox is almost a year 
younger than the previous youngest woman in the upper chamber, Baroness 
Berridge, who was born on 22 March 1972.

The newest member of the Lords joked about the potential perks of her new role

Bombarded with messages of congratulation on Twitter, she joked that including Soho in her title did not secure perks in the infamous London district

Only last week Lane Fox received a CBE for services to the UK digital economy and to charity at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

The businesswoman suffered horrific injuries in a car crash in 2004, breaking her pelvis in six places and damaging her arms and legs.

After receiving the honour, she said: 'Life’s so serendipitous. I’ve had unbelievable luck - my education, my family, all those fundamentals - and some less good luck - the accident and so on.'

She added: 'I quite often think what a parallel life would have been like - a frustrated and terribly bad actress.

'I’ve always loved innovation. It’s less about the actual technology - I’m not good technically - but I love what it can enable.'
