For a short while, there was a rumour that Neymar could recover from a broken back in time to feature again in this World Cup.

There was a treatment, it was said. There was medication. If you were going to break your back, it was reasoned, the L3 vertebrae was the way to go.

One possible procedure involved isolating the area to return full feeling to Neymar’s extremities, followed by a series of painkilling needles.

Great significance was read into the fact that the medication administered to the player so far included nothing on FIFA’s banned list. Why bother with that detail,  it was argued, if he wasn’t going to  play again?

Suddenly, coming back five weeks early from a stated six-week absence was a credible option. 

The national characteristic of Brazil is hope. So even now, following a mystified  official statement by the national federation denying Neymar’s return, it remains.

They will continue to pray for the miracle, obviously, for this is a religious and superstitious country, too. Yet if hope can be said to have a plan A it is that, without Neymar, some of the more mediocre talents within the selecao sprout wings and fly in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday evening against Germany.

Oscar had a good game against Croatia 
on the opening day; Willian has potential if given the opportunity; 
maybe Hulk through the middle.

Leading man: If there is one who represents Brazil¿s undying hope, it is Fred (right)

Alas, poor Fred. If there is a footballer who embodies Brazil’s default state of optimism it is Fred and the faith Luiz Felipe Scolari, the coach, has in his striker.

To the rest of the world, Fred has been as effective at this World Cup as a professional ice-sculpting business in Manaus, but Scolari believes and the nation must, too.

Watching Brazil’s match with Colombia last week, Juninho Paulista, whose career at Middlesbrough belies the fact he also made 50 appearances at No 10 for his country, was almost apoplectic at Fred’s inertia.

Yet this week, Rio de Janeiro tabloid Meia Hora — Half Hour News, named for being a very light read — depicted the striker on its front page as Superman, flying to the  rescue of his team in their World Cup semi-final. They may have been joking.

Capital da Esperanca is the pet name given to the country’s federal capital, Brasilia. It translates as ‘capital of hope’. It was built under the orders of former president  Juscelino Kubitschek as part of his plano de metas, which translates as ‘plan of goals’.

His slogan was ‘50 years’ prosperity in five’, an optimistic leap even by the standards of political rhetoric. And that sums up Brazil. It is a country in which better times are always around the corner, in which the  population remains largely happy and  optimistic despite a murder rate more  conducive with civil war.

Between 1980 and 2011, 1.1million people were murdered in Brazil. In 2012 alone, 47,136 were intentionally killed, although that figure is probably between 10 and 25 per cent higher, due to the number of deaths listed as unexplained in the poorest regions.

Roads are treacherous and journeys carry an underlying risk of tragedy, with roughly 35,000 dying on the roads each year (compared to under 2,000 in the United Kingdom).

Kubitschek’s plano de metas included much highway construction, at the expense of rail transportation, but many of these roads are no longer adequately  maintained and have dangerous potholes and other hazards.

Kubitschek himself died in a car accident in 1976 and it is hard to find a Brazilian life that does not contain at least one similar tragedy. A nephew of Brazil coach Scolari died in a car accident on the eve of the  tournament. Garrincha lost two sons, and his mother-in-law, all in separate road  collisions.

Optimism rises: In such volatile environment, what else remains but hope in Brazil?

Highs and lows: Brazil fans will either be celebrating wildly or heartbroken by Tuesday evening

A son of Pele was sentenced to prison for causing the death of a motorcyclist in Santos in 1999, although the decision was later overturned. Neymar was fortunate to survive a serious car accident at the age of four months.

In this volatile environment, what else remains but hope?

Western tourists now revel in the authenticity of pacified  favelas and while the team is still in the World Cup this remains a pacified Brazil.

The locals take the same optimism into their football that they display in their daily lives. Mostly, it will be OK. Mostly, we will be the lucky ones. And, if we are, then the sun is shining and the view might be beautiful, and life is good, and our team wins. E o jeitinho Brasileiro. It’s the Brazilian way.  

So while Neymar is still mourned - and his team-mates sent a tribute to him by mimicking his 'E Tois' celebration and posting it on Instagram - on Tuesday Brazilians will gather again in an almost evangelical state of expectation. This is also a country in which otherwise rational citizens place their hands on the screens of televisions sets and cry ‘O nome de Jesus’ during penalty shootouts.

Their players’ response to the national anthem is cathartic, religious in its intensity. Eyes tight shut, or weeping, they sing, long after the music has stopped.

Repeat performance? Luiz Felipe Scolari is on the verge of leading Brazil to a second World up triumph

Heart: Scolari was willing to give Oscar (background) time off after becoming a father

Scolari, an emotional, devout man who embarked on a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Caravaggio near the city of Porto Alegre to give thanks for the World Cup win of 2002, is the perfect choice to lead such a group.

At times, he is as emotionally overwrought as the country he leads in this tournament. Asked, gently, about the motivation of Neymar’s absence on Monday, he gave a reply dripping with drama.

'Neymar has left a lot of himself with us, and he will have taken a lot of us with him,' he said. 'He has done his share, now it is time for us to so our share – myself, Thiago Silva, the players, all the Brazilian people.'

There is, for obvious reasons, some wonderful writing on football in Brazil — the true name of the Maracana is Estadio Jornalista Mario Filho, after the sports journalist and writer who campaigned most tirelessly for it to be built — yet the country has preferred to deal with Neymar’s injury by emoting rather than analysing.

One-man team? Juninho, who played 50 times for Brazil, believes the side are Neymar-dependent

There has been very little criticism, for instance, of Scolari’s brutal approach to James Rodriguez and the more creative players in the Colombia team that may have inspired Juan Zuniga’s fateful payback assault on Brazil’s greatest player. So, how weakened are Brazil by his absence? Statistics suggest, not as much as people think.

Since 2010, Brazil have played 60 international fixtures of which Neymar has missed six, and five of those have ended in victory nonetheless. The greatest pull, therefore, is psychological.

‘Brazil are Neymar-dependent,’ said Juninho. He meant as much in the mind as in the way they play.

It has been noted, particularly against Colombia, that the backline were frequently bypassing the midfield, in a desperate attempt to pick out their best player as if unable to contemplate an alternate route to goal. This attracted more criticism than any violence in Brazil’s play.

It means the game against Germany can take two directions: either the team will look lost without their marquee match-winner, or they will have no choice but to play as 11, rather than 10, plus one.

It would be foolish to say they will be better without Neymar, but they might not be bereft. That is the hope, and the fervent prayer. And esperanca springs eternal in Brazil, as it always does.
