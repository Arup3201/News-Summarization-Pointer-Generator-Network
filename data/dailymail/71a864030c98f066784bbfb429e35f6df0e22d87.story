The head of the world’s economic watchdog yesterday delivered an extraordinary call for the Bank of England to cut interest rates even further as British households were warned the income squeeze will last for another 18 months.

Christine Lagarde, of the International Monetary Fund, gave a strong endorsement of the Government’s deficit cutting plan – but suggested that if growth failed to pick up, temporary cuts in VAT or National Insurance should be considered.

Mrs Lagarde said the Bank of England should ‘reassess the efficacy’ of cutting rates below the current record low of 0.5 per cent to reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses and homeowners.

Labour insisted the IMF report showed Britain needed to come up with a ‘plan B’ to kickstart growth and stop the economy sliding further into recession.

But Chancellor George Osborne said the study backed his decision to take tough measures in 2010 to start slashing back the deficit inherited by the Coalition.

Mrs Lagarde’s intervention raises the prospect of the first zero per cent interest rate since the Bank of England was founded in 1694. 

Japan cut rates to zero in the 1990s when it suffered a decade-long depression. But because the banks were so focused on reducing bad assets, they were not interested in handing out more loans and the plan did little to speed up growth.

Mrs Lagarde also suggested that the Bank considers a fresh round of money printing – so-called ‘quantitative easing’ – to stimulate growth.

Both measures would be grim news for savers, who have already been hit hard by low interest rates and earlier rounds of QE, which have helped drive the value of pension annuities to rock bottom levels.

The Office for Economic  Co-operation and Development, meanwhile, warned that consumer prices will rise faster than disposable incomes both this year and next, meaning another year-and-a-half in which families can expect to be worse off in real terms.

The IMF boss, in London  to deliver her annual assessment of the UK economy, delighted Mr Osborne by backing the Coalition’s deficit reduction measures.

She said that when she looked back to the last election in May 2010, she ‘shivered’ to imagine what would have happened to the British economy without the austerity programme. ‘She later told ITV News that the Government had cut the deficit from 11 per cent of national income to 8 per cent now.

‘You have to compare that against other countries which experienced severe deficit numbers, did not take action right away and are now facing very, very stressful financing terms that is putting their situation in jeopardy,’ she said.

However, in its annual assessment of the UK’s economic record, the IMF said the Treasury should be ready to consider making temporary tax cuts to kickstart the economy if ‘recovery fails to take off’.

One possibility would be a temporary cut in VAT, which was raised to 20 per cent from 17.5 per cent in the Chancellor’s first budget.

Such a move would be a political disaster for Mr Osborne, since it is precisely what Labour has been calling for since the economy began to stutter again in the final months of last year.

An alternative would be for the Government to offer a temporary cut in National Insurance – raised by Labour before it left office – as a means of boosting business and jobs.

The IMF noted that the economy remains ‘flat’ and warned that the weak recovery may be ‘more protracted than previously anticipated’.

The Chancellor listens intently as Christine Lagarde said the Bank of England should ¿reassess the efficacy¿ of cutting rates below the current record low

Mrs Lagarde backed a suggestion by David Cameron that the Government should consider using its hard-won credibility on the international money markets, which means Britain is able to borrow at record lows, to do more to underwrite infrastructure and housing projects and loans to small businesses.

The IMF also suggested there was scope for the Government to boost growth through higher infrastructure spending, which could be funded by imposing further public sector wage restraint or reforming property taxes.

The Chancellor said: ‘The IMF couldn’t be clearer. Britain has to deal with its debts and the Government’s fiscal policy is the appropriate one.’

Pressure: The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.5% for several years but is being asked to go further

Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, insisted a plan B was required. He added: ‘If we fail to do so, and we see years of slow growth and high unemployment being entrenched.’

The OECD left its 2012 growth forecast unchanged at 0.5 per cent, but suggested another small decline in real incomes would be seen this year and next.

Households have already suffered the sharpest fall in living standards since the 1920s.

The Prime Minister will today warn EU leaders that Europe will be plunged into recession unless action is taken to prevent Greece falling out of the single currency.

At an emergency summit on the eurozone crisis, Mr Cameron is expected to step up pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to allow the European Central Bank to issue ‘eurobonds’ – which would effectively see Germany underwrite the debt of stricken countries such as Greece.
