A Harvard-educated professor is set to spend one year living in a 33-square-foot dumpster.

Dr Jeff Wilson, who teaches environmental science at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, says he wants to spread awareness about sustainability and promote the model of 'less is more'.

He will move into the six-foot-nine-inch high steel waste bin - which gives him eight inches of head room - on Thanksgiving day with only a sports bag full of possessions.

My new home! Dr. Jeff Wilson, a Harvard-educated university professor, is set to spend one year living inside a 33-square-foot dumpster - gradually he will deck it out with creature comforts

Dr Wilson will start out by camping out in the sanitized and safety-tested garbage unit - which cost in the region of $2,000 - with a sleeping bag, arranged in a hammock-like set-up.

Luckily, temperatures in Austin stay around the 50F mark throughout winter, so he doesn't anticipate needing a heater.

Over time, he plans on kitting the tiny shelter with 'creature comforts' including a bed, lights, shower, toilet, air conditioning, WiFi and even an Xbox console.

'In the end I want that space capsule to be designed to a standard that even my mother would give it a go for a night.,' Dr Wilson told MailOnline.

Welcome to my new abode: Dr Wilson will start out by camping out in the sanitized and safety-tested garbage unit - which cost in the region of $2,000 - with a sleeping bag, arranged in a hammock-like set-up

To make the space as energy efficient as 
possible solar panels will be installed along with other environmentally-friendly gadgets.

Keeping his teaching cap firmly on, Dr Wilson plans on getting all of his students involved in his year-long experiment.

daughter sleeping with daddy in a dumpster'

They will help renovate the dwelling and also be invited to stay their when Dr Wilson 'needs a break.'

He said after the project, depending 
on what the dumpster ends up looking like, he'd like to have it as 'at 
least a holiday home or bachelor pad - off campus - perpetually.'

The divorced, father-of-one sold all of his personal items last year for a $1-a-piece in preparation for living a frugal life.

He also gave up his apartment and spent nights sleeping on the floor of his office and staying at his girlfriend's apartment.

I'll be just toasty: Luckily, temperatures in Austin stay around the 50F mark throughout winter, so Dr Wilson doesn't anticipate needing a heater

And now with his long-held plan to move into a 
dumpster university-approved - as an educational 
experiment in low-impact living called The Dumpster Project - he is ready to up sticks again.

He says some people have not been so enthusaitic about his project, including his ex-wife 'who did not express a lot of encouragement in our [six-year-old] 
daughter sleeping with daddy in a dumpster.'

However, his students says they are excited about his zany idea. Evette Jackson, a psychology and criminal justice major at Huston-Tillotson University told KVUE.com: 'I think it's pretty intriguing. It's pretty cool. I want to live in it too.'

Eccentric: Dr Wilson's students say they are excited about his dumpster project

Dr Wilson's plan is to eventually take the show on the road.

'This will allow us to do some interesting experiments, [like] dropping it on a kid’s playground and seeing what happens. Because they’re going to open the door and see an Xbox, a bed, a shower, all these things.'

He concluded: 'This is a grand experiment on living in less space with the hypothesis that one can have a happy, fulfilling, and productive life in one per cent the size of the average American home.

'It may turn out that it's an absolutely fab arrangement. Or, it might not. We'll see.'
