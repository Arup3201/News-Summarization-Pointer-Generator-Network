New South Wales Premier Mike Baird has revealed he feared all of the Sydney siege hostages were going to die in an emotional interview. 

Mr Baird, who has only been in the job since April, also told the ABC's 7.30 program about the moment he was told a hostage had been gunned down by Man Horan Monis on Tuesday morning.

'My deep fear at the first sight, as the scene started to come to television, was that we were going to lose everyone,' he said.

'I just had this deep fear. And I do remember when the - I received a call that a hostage had gone down. 

'My heart sunk to the floor and I couldn't believe that it had happened. I was just an absolute - a wreck.' 

Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson were killed by the crazed gunman as the sixteen hour siege came to a bloody end around 2am Tuesday. 

Monis was killed by tactical police officers in a hail of bullets as they tried to save the lives of the eighteen captives. 

In the interview, Mr Baird - who said he was proud of how Sydney and the state had responded to the tragedy - said  he hoped the growing flower memorial in Martin Place would continue.

'In many respects, Leigh, I don't want it to end. It's just so beautiful down there,' he said. 'And it's the people, it's the stories, it's the families. 

'I mean, people, complete strangers are hugging, in tears, putting down the flowers, reflecting on the loss, the thankfulness, in some respects, for the hostages that are still with us and an overall sense in this city that we will get through this.'

Mr Baird was scathing about Senator David Leyonhjelm's proposal that Australia loosen its guns laws.

'Yeah, I've never heard anything more ridiculous than those comments today,' he said.

'I mean, to put those sorts of comments at this time is absolutely inappropriate. it's almost outrageous.'

Following the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 where a gunman killed 35 people, Prime Minister John Howard introduced new gun laws which radically restricted the availability of firearms to the public. 

According to a study by Labor MP Andrew Leigh, the gun buyback saves the lives of around 200 Australians each year.
