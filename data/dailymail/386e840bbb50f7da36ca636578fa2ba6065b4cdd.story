Muslim students from the disputed Indian territory of Kashmir, who were suspended from their university after cheering for the Pakistani cricket match, have been charged with disturbing communal harmony, police in the state of Uttar Pradesh said.

At least 66 students were kicked out of Meerut Swami Vivekanand Subharti University (SVSU) in Srinagar, Kashmir after cheering for the team during a televised Asia Cup match against India on Sunday.

Protests later broke out against the suspensions which led to the arrest of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) leader, Yasin Malik, as well as half a dozen of his supporters.

Protest: Hundreds took part in protest marches after Muslim students 
were suspended from an Indian university for cheering on Pakistan during a
 rival cricket match. At least 66 students were suspended and threatened with a sedition charge by the UP 
government

Before the protests, authorities tried to 
track down the students for questioning over the alleged incident. It was believed they would be charged with sedition - which carries a life sentence.

But the charges were dropped after sharp criticism from political circles and the Pakistani government.

Akhilesh Yadav, chief minister of 
northern Uttar Pradesh state, said he told state officials that sedition 
should be not be used because the students probably did not understand 'the seriousness of their actions'.

India's Meerut Swami Vivekanand Subharti University (SVSU)

The students had been living in the 
dorms at the university about 560 miles from 
their homes in India-controlled Kashmir while studying at the university.

After the incident, many of the students went back home to Srinagar, the main city in the state.

Several claimed they had been discriminated against.

Muteebul Majid, a business administration student in his 20s, said: ‘We didn't do anything illegal. Are they slapping these charges against us for being Kashmiris or for cheering for the Pakistani team?’

Gulzar Ahmed, also a business administration student, said he and his friends were never given a chance to explain themselves.

He said: ‘They (local students) attacked us with stones and abuse after the match. Instead of taking action against their hooliganism, police bused us to the railway station and directed us to go home.'

Chanting: Supporters of the JKLF shout 
pro-freedom slogans during the protest in Srinagar, India on Friday. The day before, the students have been threatened with being charged with sedition which carries a life sentence

Cricket is one of the few things which unites Pakistan and India, but Sunday's incident shows how easily things can turn sour.

Minutes after Pakistan won the close match, hundreds of Kashmiris lit firecrackers and chanted 'Long live Pakistan' and 'We want freedom'.

Omar Abdullah, the top elected official in the Indian portion of Kashmir, said the students had been 'misguided' but that sedition charges would ruin their future.

He said: ‘I don't condone what they did, what they did was obviously wrong and misguided.

‘That having been said, they are young and sedition charges will further push them to the fringes.'

The banned Kashmir University Students Union said in a statement the reaction was ‘testimony to the fact that we have been in a perpetual state of war with India since the past 67 years’.

Pakistan's government also showed support for the students.

Pakistani Foreign Office spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said: ‘If these Kashmiri students want to come and pursue their studies in Pakistan, our hearts and academic institutions are open to them.'
