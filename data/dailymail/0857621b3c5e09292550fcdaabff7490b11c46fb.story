A historical mystery has been uncovered at Sheffield Cathedral after 15 aristocratic bodies disappeared from the crypt.

In the Tudor era, the Earl of Shrewsbury built a special chapel to house the bodies of his descendants - but 500 years later, nearly all of them have gone missing.

The body-snatching whodunnit was only revealed last week, when archaeologists opened up the sealed crypt and found 15 fewer bodies than they had expected.

Mystery: This is the entrance to the crypt of the Shrewsbury Chapel, where 15 bodies have disappeared

Setting: The remarkable find was made by archaeologists during renovations of Sheffield Cathedral

George Talbot, fourth Earl of Shrewsbury, constructed the Shrewsbury Chapel in 1520, when the cathedral was just a parish church.

He intended the chapel to house him and his descendants after their deaths, and when he died he was buried there.

The monument to the fourth Earl - along with that to his grandson, the sixth Earl, who guarded Mary Queen of Scots - became one of the church's most famous features.

More than a dozen of their descendants were also buried in the chapel, as the Talbots were considered Sheffield's leading family thanks to their status as Lords of the Manor.

Investigation: Canon Rev. Simon Cowling peers into the entrance buried in the chapel's floor

Discovery: Workers had to dig deep through the centuries-old floor of the chapel to find the crypt

However, by 1809 all but two of the coffins supposed to be in the chapel had vanished, according to antiquarian Joseph Hunter, the last man to visit the crypt before it was sealed in the early 19th century.

Although Hunter dutifully recorded the loss of the 15 bodies, his discovery seems to have slipped out of the historical record until this year.

A renovation project began in the cathedral earlier this year, and last week workmen were digging up the floor of the chapel when they came across the entrance to the Shrewsbury tomb.

However, when they entered they realised that of the 17 nobles supposed to be buried there, only two remained - the seventh Earl, Gilbert, who died in 1616, and 18th-century aristocrat Henry Howard.

Powerful: George, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, is supposed to be in the crypt of the Shrewsbury Chapel

Iconic: The monument to the sixth Earl, pictured, is one of the most impressive sights in the cathedral

The most obvious solution to the 
puzzle might seem to be grave-snatching, but the fact that the heavy 
lead coffins are missing as well as the corpses themselves would seem to
suggest that this was not the case.

Archaeologists
are now exploring the possibility that the crypt harbours a secret wall
concealing the true location of the bodies.

Alternatively, the coffins may have been removed from the chapel and taken to a different location.

Cathedral
officials are now collaborating with historians from the University of 
Sheffield in an effort to crack the mystery and hunt down the bodies.

Peter
Bradley, the Dean of Sheffield, said: 'We will be working closely with 
our partners at Sheffield University to solve this mystery, as one of 
the missing bodies belongs to one of the most important men in 
Elizabethan England - George Talbot, the sixth Earl of Shrewsbury.'

The Talbot family, who were ennobled in the 15th century as the Earls of Shrewsbury, owned most of Sheffield and rose to become one of England's most influential families under the Tudor dynasty.

The fourth Earl built the Shrewsbury Chapel before his death in 1538, and in his will ordered a monument to be made featuring him flanked by his two wives, Anne and Elizabeth.

He married Anne when he was just 13, and the couple had 11 children before she died and he re-married.

The Earl was made Lieutenant General of the North, and once entertained Cardinal Wolsey as the notorious priest travelled south to face trial for treason.

In 1536, he put down the 'Pilgrimage of Grace', a popular rebellion against Henry VIII's religious policy.

However, it is his grandson, the sixth Earl, who has the largest monument in Sheffield Cathedral, standing against the chapel's south wall.

He was best known for marrying Bess of Hardwick, then the richest woman in England apart from Elizabeth I, and for guarding Mary Queen of Scots during her 14 years of imprisonment in Sheffield.

Looking after Mary, the mother of James I, nearly ruined him financially - and he is said to have suffered emotional turmoil too, having fallen in love with her yet being forced to watch her execution.

Works: The chapel has been turned into a building site during the renovations and investigation

Atmospheric: The cathedral has providing the setting for a 500-year-old historical detective story

Archaeology: The cathedral and chapel are set to be restored to their former glory

The monument to the sixth Earl shows him lying on a rush mat wearing elaborate armour, his feet resting on a trusty dog.

At his funeral, so many townspeople turned out to catch a glimpse of his coffin that two trees were said to have collapsed under the weight of the men who had climbed them to get a better look.

The Shrewsbury Chapel passed out of the hands of the Talbot family when one of their heiresses married Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, whose descendants became the Dukes of Norfolk.

The church where the chapel was located became Sheffield Cathedral in 1914, and in 1933 the 16th Duke of Norfolk donated the chapel to the cathedral to be enjoyed by the public.

Fame: George, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, who served as custodian to Mary Queen of Scots

1406: Sheffield was passed to John Talbot, first Earl of Shrewsbury, from Sir Thomas Nevil.

1453: The first Earl died in battle at Chatillon in France. He was immortalised in Shakespeare's Henry VI Part 1 as 'valiant Talbot, above human thought'.

1460: The second Earl, John, died during the Wars of the Roses, and the Lordship passed to the third John Talbot.

1510: The fourth Earl, George, ordered the construction of Sheffield Manor just one mile from Sheffield Castle.

1520: The fourth Earl added a chapel to the parish church, now Sheffield Cathedral, to hold the family tombs.

1530: Cardinal Wolsey visited Sheffield Manor as a guest on his way to London to stand trial for high treason before Henry VIII.

1538: The funeral of the fourth Earl took place in Sheffield amid much pomp and ceremony

1553: The sixth Earl, George, right, took over the lordship of the manor.

1570-84: The sixth Earl was responsible for safe custody of Mary Queen of Scots and kept her at Sheffield Manor, Sheffield Castle and Worksop Manor as well as at his Midlands estates.

1590: More than 20,000 people attended the elaborate funeral of the sixth Earl at Sheffield Cathedral. Gilbert became the seventh Earl and inherited the lordship of Sheffield Manor.

1616: The seventh Earl died. He had no sons so his property, including the Sheffield estates, were inherited by his daughter Alethea Talbot. She was married to Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, so the Sheffield estates were absorbed into the House of Howard.
