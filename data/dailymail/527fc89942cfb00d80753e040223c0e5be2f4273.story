The Countess of Wessex has issued a plea for more people to learn first aid, after a close friend’s daughter saved the life of a stranger on the Tube.

Honouring Britain’s lifesavers at the St John Ambulance Everyday Heroes Awards last week, run in association with The Mail on Sunday, she revealed that first-aid training meant the 19-year-old was able to treat a man who collapsed in front of her at a station.

‘She immediately rushed to see if she could help him, checked his breathing and put him in the recovery position.

'Then she had to run to find someone to call for an ambulance. After this she went back to the man and stayed with him until help arrived,’ said Sophie, Countess of Wessex.

‘During all this time not one person stopped to offer assistance. Thankfully this girl had received first-aid training so she did all the right things.

‘So many people seem to walk on by when something happens; I think the biggest barrier is that without proper first-aid training we think that we might do more harm than good.’

Her call echoes The Mail on Sunday’s campaign for every schoolchild to be taught first aid.

The awards were presented by Tess Daly at a star-studded ceremony at the Lancaster London Hotel.

Restaurant team leader Ceinwen Morgans (pictured below) saved the life of 82-year-old John Ollerenshaw when he had a sudden cardiac arrest shortly after arriving for a meal.

‘I
 watched him collapse and quickly ran over,’ says Ceinwen, who had been 
sent on a first-aid course a few months before through her work at The 
Princess Pavilion in Falmouth, Cornwall.

‘It
 took me a few moments to work out what was going on and then I started 
compressions straight away.

The adrenaline kicked in and I was 
completely focused on keeping going and saving his life. I carried on 
for 35 minutes, which was pretty exhausting.

Even when the ambulance 
arrived I carried on as they set up the defibrillator.’

Ceinwen,
 26, adds: ‘It was a strange experience but I didn’t have time to stop 
and think about it at the time.

'I’d only done my first aid training 
really recently and never imagined I’d have to use it in real life in 
such a serious situation.’

John went on to make a full recovery and the pair have kept in touch

Parkland Primary School in South Wigston, Leicestershire, won the Top of The Class award for its forward-thinking attitude to teaching first aid.

All 500 children are given the opportunity to attend first-aid training – starting when they are just four.

Pupils continue to receive refresher courses every term until they leave at 11.

‘We start with teaching them how to call 999 and by Year One they are learning basic CPR,’ says nursery nurse and first aider Alison Chapman.

‘At the beginning they are just bouncing around but they can do it quite competently by Year Six.

'So many adults don’t know how to do it but it’s an essential life skill and I’d love it to be part of the national curriculum.’

Alison, right, adds: ‘It’s really important to start teaching children first aid from as young as possible.’

The school is the first in the country to have an automated defibrillator, which is also available for use by the community.

The TV presenter said the importance of first aid hit her after an emotive ad campaign by St John Ambulance which showed a boy falling from a tree with nobody nearby who knew first aid.

She said: ‘As a mum to two young daughters, I’ve seen my share of cut knees and bumps to the head. But seeing the advert, I realised how serious some childhood accidents can be.’

Mail on Sunday readers voted 15-year-old Sam Herbert winner of the Guy Evans Award.

He saved a man who collapsed in the street, despite himself having a congenital heart defect.

Sam had received first-aid training as an Army Cadet so he immediately began CPR.

‘Because of my heart condition I was worried I wouldn’t have the strength to perform CPR for long so I showed a woman who was passing by how to do it,’ says Sam.

Assistant head teacher Simon Underwood saved the life of a 15-month-old boy found face down in a stream.

Simon, 40, had just arrived at a holiday park for a camping trip with his wife Tabitha, 32, and children Finlay, four, and Islay-Mae, two, when he heard the distressed cries of the toddler’s family and ran over.

‘He was limp and his skin was purple and he looked bloated,’ says Simon, who began CPR while everyone around him was panicking and shouting.

‘The family were clearly distraught so I stepped in. I  feel instantly calm in situations like that and I went on to autopilot; I knew we had  zero time to waste.’

Simon, right, had learnt CPR after co-coordinating and supervising first-aid classes for his pupils at Oxford Academy over several years.

After three minutes of CPR, Simon had made no progress so he held the toddler upside down to allow some water to come out of his mouth and nose. Then he carried on with CPR for a couple of minutes until the boy vomited. He suddenly heard shallow, gurgling breaths coming from  the child.

He explained: ‘I didn’t want to carry on in case I caused damage so we put him in the recovery position and put a blanket over him until the ambulance arrived.’ The toddler was taken to hospital from the Northamptonshire park and fully recovered after time in intensive care.

Simon describes the events of that day as ‘the best and worst experience of my life.’ He still has flashbacks but imagines it is the lives of his own children he is trying to save.

‘Having young children myself has made it really hard to come to terms with,’ he says.

‘Not having seen the boy or spoken to the family since that day it’s been difficult to get any closure. It still feels very raw.’

‘We do lots of practice at first aid in Army Cadets but I never thought I’d use it in real life.’

Sam,
 who lives in Derby with lorry driver father dad David, 50, stepmother 
Beverley, 44, who is a shop assistant, sister Katie, 17, step sister 
Rebecca, 17 and step brother Dylan, 13, has Ivemark syndrome.

This means he was born with a deformed heart and lungs and most of his internal organs are reversed. He has had countless operations and it has reduced his strength as a result. But he said: ‘I’ve never let my condition hold me back.’

Also presenting an award was former 
footballer Fabrice Muamba, whose life was saved by first aid when he 
suffered cardiac arrest at an FA Cup match in 2012.

He said: ‘It doesn’t matter what car you drive or what’s in your wallet when you need first aid.’Here we feature four other winners and their inspirational stories.

Engineer Karen Lawrence and administrator Diane Fullerton saved the life of 33-year-old Chris Middleton who had a sudden cardiac arrest while visiting their workplace for a meeting.

Ironically, Karen, 48, was standing next to the defibrillator in fellow first aider Diane’s office when colleagues at General Dynamics rang for help. Karen dialled 999 while Diane, 49, drove them – and the defibrillator – to the meeting room in a different building on the site in Pershore, Worcestershire.

The pair could tell things didn’t look good for Chris, whose breathing was ragged and sporadic. The 999 operator stayed on the line the whole time and advised them to use the defibrillator.

‘I was surprised to have to use it because Chris didn’t look like heart attack material. He’s young, not overweight. The training kicked in though and we just got on with it,’ says Diane, who lives in Ledbury, Herefordshire, with husband Peter.

After delivering the first shock to Chris, Karen carried on with CPR. They were then advised to give him a further shock, after which Diane took over with CPR until an ambulance arrived.

‘Seeing Chris looking so much better now is lovely,’ adds Karen, who lives in Worcester with her 13-year-old son Ben.

‘I still get very upset at the thought that he might have missed his first father’s day with his baby son if it hadn’t been for the defibrillator.’
