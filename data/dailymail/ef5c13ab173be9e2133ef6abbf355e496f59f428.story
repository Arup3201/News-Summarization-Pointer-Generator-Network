Loans: Sandra Lowe, pictured, is accused of lending money to friends before demanding it back 'with menaces'

A foster carer ran an illegal business lending her friends thousands of pounds in cash then threatened them when they could not repay the money, a court has heard.

Sandra Lowe is alleged to have made a 'nice little profit' running the loan business - but the 50-year-old insists she was only acting out of charity.

The 50-year-old mother of two from Manchester also allegedly had an unlicenced catalogue business in which she charged commission for ordering goods for her friend.

Lowe, who works as a foster carer for her local council, denied eight charges of unlawfully engaging in the activities of a consumer credit business without a licence and one charge of blackmail at Manchester Crown Court.

Cafe owner Maria Turner, who said she was 'like a sister' to Lowe, told the court that she borrowed up to £50,000 from her friend over a seven-year period to repay her mortgage and other debts.

She ended up repaying £125,000, according to the prosecution - and shortly before Lowe was arrested in 2012, she was told she still owed £40,000.

Ms Turner told the court she felt like an 'idiot' for losing track of her finances and not monitoring how much she owed the defendant.

She said that her money troubles had 'snowballed' because she was under 'enormous pressure' running a sandwich shop, a chip shop, an ironing business and nine rental properties.

Her home was repossessed in 2011 and she went to stay with Lowe, who had to talk her out of committing suicide, she told the court.

But the next day, Ms Turner claimed, her friend forced her to sign a document saying she still owed her £52,000, even though she had been handing over hundreds of pounds a week for several years.

Sobbing, she told the court: 'When I saw the £50,000 I owed it kind of sent me to another place. I thought, "I'll never do it - I'll be paying it until I'm 70."'

It is alleged that Lowe 'demanded money with menaces' between May and July 2012.

'Threats': Jurors were read a series of text messages allegedly sent from Lowe to Maria Turner in which she said she would tell her friend's relatives about her debts

The court heard excerpts from a series of text messages allegedly sent by Lowe to Ms Turner threatening to reveal her debts to family members if she did not repay them.

One read: 'You better get the f***ing money in or I will tell your son. I will come to the shop and will take it out of your till. Don't think you can get away with missing this week. I need my money.'

In another, Lowe allegedly wrote: 'Please let's not be playing catch up, don't think you know how p***ed off I am, I need my money ASAP, if you don't pay I will tell.'

A third read: 'Sorry for the text but you bring it on. I want £575 in my bank so start putting it in now. Can't believe after how I've been. I'm sick of playing catch up. I'm being as fair as I can.

'I don't want it split in drips and drabs, my patience is running really thin. I'm struggling because of you, friend or not.'

Ms Turner said: 'I was waking up to it and going to bed with it. It was awful, terrible, disgusting. It makes your body shake... you can't focus, your mind's in a spin. You want to rob a bank to pay it.'

She added that only Lowe's arrest allowed her to escape her spiralling debts, saying: 'It would still be happening now if this didn't happen. I just used to pay it.'

Ms Turner told the court that she was never told what the interest rate was on her loans.

The prosecution also allege that Lowe ran an unlicensed catalogue business, supplying friends with goods she had ordered from firms such as Kays and Argos and claiming a profit on them.

Following her arrest, Lowe insisted that she did work for Kays, although the prosecution says the firm has no record of her.

Opening the case, Ben Mills, prosecuting, told the jury: 'She says this was all charity work - me loaning money for nothing, me administering all these loans for nothing.'

The trial continues.
