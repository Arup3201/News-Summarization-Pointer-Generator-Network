The chalet ski holiday is a quirk of British culture - and my goodness, it's a survivor.

Most civilised countries think being cooped up in a poky wooden house with eight or ten others, sometimes sharing bathrooms and eating food cooked by gap-year students, has all the ingredients of a ghastly TV reality show.

But as a nation, we can't get enough of it.

A hideaway on the edge of the slopes: Nid d'Aigle is perfectly positioned for skiing in Courchevel 1650

Yes, things can go wrong (I remember coming down early one morning and seeing a young man rushing up from the basement where the chalet girls stayed. "Sorry, forgot my trousers," he said.)

But standards have risen greatly since the Seventies when Colin Murison-Small pioneered this kind of holiday with the help of his Sloaney 'Muribirds'.

Powder White has been in the game more than ten years and operates in the ski world's Big Five - Val d'Isere, St Anton, Verbier, Meribel and Courchevel.

It's a super-efficient and flexible company.

Come on in, the fire's lit: The chalet has a cosy atmosphere in its main lounge space

If you want only three or four dinners in the chalet, rather than six, that's fine (the price is adjusted accordingly) and if you book ski and boot hire in advance, a man appears on your first evening with all the clobber.

We opted for chalet Nid d'Aigle in Courchevel 1650, where eight of us snuggled down in four double rooms, all with en-suite bathrooms.

Chalet girls Antonia and Hannah, who had been at school together, were charming and rustled up simple, but delicious, food (freshly baked cakes for tea) and the selection of wines (included at no extra cost) was greatly appreciated.

We drank vast quantities.

A lot has been said about the Russian invasion of Courchevel 1850, the next valley along from 1650 - and it's all true, with Prada, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari et al setting up shops beside the piste.

A space to relax away from the slopes: The chalet has space for eight people in four double rooms

But Courchevel 1650 is a different world entirely, with a few simple bars and restaurants, one or two hotels and lots of chalets on the hill.

What's admirably swanky, however, are the escalators that save you walking long distances with your gear to and from the main bubble lift up the mountain.

The Three Valleys (Courchevel, Méribel, Val Thorens) is such a large area it's worth spending a day or even half day with a reputable ski guiding company.

We chose Marmalade and not one, but two, qualified ski instructors arrived - the boss Derek and colleague Nick.

They skied with effortless style and were good company, too. While lots of people make for the dizzy heights of Val Thorens, we tended to ski mainly in 1650 and then found some superbly uncrowded runs through trees down to La Praz and La Tania.

The challenge most days was to find places to eat on the mountain that were accessible to non-skiers such as my wife, for whom even sitting upstairs on a double-decker bus is something of a vertigo challenge.

Out on the terrace: The chalet offers the opportunity for al fresco dining - if you feel it's warm enough

This proved remarkably easy.

Le Bel Air, at the top of the Ariondaz bubble lift, has a gorgeous balcony and the food is top-notch without charging Russian prices; the newly opened Les Chenus restaurant in 1850 is another good option if you're happy with a fancy burger and there's a decent and lively restaurant at the top of the La Tania bubble.

Sadly we could not get to my favourite, Les Cretes, where the Jacquemard family has been in business more than 25 years.

On the chalet girls' day off, the younger members of our group enjoyed a fondue at Le Petit Savoyard, while my wife and I checked out 1850's newest hotel, L'Apogée.

My goodness, it's plush.

Wonderful food. Gorgeous pool. Stay here and your skis are put out for you in the morning and there is even a small drag lift so you don't have to walk uphill for all of 20 yards.

A mountain marvel: Courchevel is one of the most fabled ski resorts in the French Alps

Life was a little more simple back in our chalet - and a lot more British.

But just as wonderful.
