A woman who chose to leap 20ft from a window onto concrete to escape a crazed sex attacker has shared the story of her horrific dilemma. Â 

Jemma Rixon appeared on today's This Morning to reveal how she risked her life to jump from a building rather than be left in the clutches of schizophrenic Craig Cantwell.

She told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that she had 'no option' but to leap from the window at the care home where she worked in Birkenhead in last July after Cantwell started threatening her.

Horrific dilemma: Jemma Rixon chose to leap 20ft from a window to escape a sex attacker

Jemma, 20, admitted she may have been 'naive' about Cantwell, 29, in the past when he had made references to them being a couple as she carried out her duties at the home where he was a patient.

Then one day when she was helping him with his medication, he locked her in a medication room with him.

Jemma recalled: 'I had my back to him but I heard the sound of the door being locked and knew something wasn't right. I tried to 
be normal and to stay clam and professional. He started being 
aggressive and pushing me on the shoulder, demanding me to get into 
bathroom and bend over.'

She added: 'I managed to fight him off, we had tug of war with the bathroom door but I managed with all my strength
 to lock it.

'I had my phone and was trying to call the police but I was so frightened I couldn't dial. I managed to ring the person on my last call list but they didn't answer.

'Then he started saying, "Jemma come out or I'll hurt you".'

Nightmare: The care home worker shared her story on This Morning. Presenter Eamonn Holmes said her experience was 'like a horror film'

In what Eamonn described as like 'something from a horror film', Cantwell then started smashing a hole in the plasterboard wall to try and reach Jemma. Within seconds, he had been able to create a gap large enough to push his head and shoulder through.

'...it completely knocked my confidence, I now suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and have nightmares'

Jemma said she knew then her only option was to jump out the window.

She said: 'I realised he could get to me in seconds, my only option was to jump. 
The window was so small, I just flung myself out and landed on my back on concrete.'

As a result of her fall, the care worker fractured her spine, neck and foot. But her ordeal still wasn't over as Cantwell then began rushing from the building to reach her.

Still recovering: Jemma suffers from post traumatic stress

She said she managed to 'stagger' into the street where she appealed for help from some milkman doing their morning rounds.

Cantwell then appeared on the street brandishing a metal pole which he used to start smashing parked cars.

As previously reported in the Daily Mail, he was then arrested and stood trial at Liverpool Crown Court after he denied inflicting grievous bodily harm, affray and committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence.

Despite his mental health issues, the court heard Cantwell, from Manchester, knew what he was doing on the night of the attack.

He was found guilty by a jury on all charges and jailed for nine years.

Jemma said on This Morning that she was 'happy' with the sentence but she is still struggling to come to terms with her ordeal.

She said: 'It completely knocked my confidence, I now suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and have nightmares.'
