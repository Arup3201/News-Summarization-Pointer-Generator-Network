They are among motorists' pet hates, with councils constantly under pressure to fix potholes as soon as they blight any road.

But one local authority appear to have different priorities - after they ignored the two-inch deep hole and instead painted white speed camera lines straight over it.

Drivers in Kelvedon Hatch, near Brentwood, Essex, have been left astonished after highways engineers refused to fill in the pothole and simply painted over it.

Safety first? Essex County Council opted to paint over this pothole near Brentwood rather than fill it in

The speed camera next to a pothole is on the A128 near Kelvedon Hatch on the way to Brentwood, Essex

Officials ignored the one foot-long dip in favour of painting small white stripes along the road in line with a speed camera placed a few metres away.

The bizarre action has left furious villagers convinced that Essex County Council are more interested in making money from speeding fines than making roads safe.

Paul Bonnet, parish councillor for nearby Stondon Masey. said: 'You couldn’t make this up. It is absolutely crazy. I’m a taxpayer and I couldn’t believe what they had done.

'If they’d had enough white paint they could have filled the whole thing up and made it level.

The pothole is around two inches deep and has already caught out dozens of drivers on the way through Essex

'When the lorry turned up my immediate reaction was, at least they are fixing the pothole, but then they just repainted the lines, one of them actually in the pothole itself.

'They obviously care about the money from the camera more than the safety of motorists and cyclists.

'Why are they not prioritising people’s and motorists’ safety rather than a speed camera?'

The camera is in the pretty village of Kelvedon Hatch on the A128 road which runs towards Brentwood.

The side of the road is littered with hubcaps that have come off when motorists have driven through the huge pothole too fast and numerous drivers have suffered split tyres.

'The pothole is at least two inches deep and really dangerous if you don’t know it’s there,' said resident Sarah Clarke.

'It’s ridiculous that they have painted the white lines before repairing the damaged road.'

A spokesman for Essex County Council said last night: 'Essex Highways is currently renewing the lining at various safety camera sites across the county.

'Unfortunately, on this occasion the lining crew proceeded with the lining renewal as instructed, despite the appearance of this defect.

The pot hole is due to be repaired within the next three days and any damaged markings will be repainted immediately afterwards. Instructions have been issued to the crews to prevent this from happening again.'
