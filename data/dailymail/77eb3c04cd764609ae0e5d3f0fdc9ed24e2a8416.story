Australian of the Year Rosie Batty has sparked an outpouring of reactions on social media about domestic violence after she appeared on Monday night's Q&A program on the ABC.

The panel program had a frank discussion on the issue, which included former politician Natasha Stott Despoja, Victoria Acting Police Commissioner Tim Cartwright, sports broadcaster Charlie King and family social worker Simon Santosha.

Ms Batty provided a victim's point of view to the show and her experience struck a nerve with the audience and Twitter users.

When asked by a viewer why women stay in abusive relationships, the family violence campaigner gave a heartbreaking response, which shed light on the emotions victims go through.

'When we say "why doesn't she leave", sometimes it's because that is the highest point of risk to be killed or injured and sometimes when you're in that type of relationship, all I can say is that you have a fear that you can't really explain, it's a dread... of what could happen next,' Ms Batty said.

'Quite often you stay in the situation you know because by taking out an AVO it's gonna piss him off, by taking him to court, making a statement to police it’s gonna piss him off. You don’t know what we’re going to exacerbate.'

It seems Ms Batty's appearance on Q&A was an emotional one for many social media users who took to Twitter to thank her for speaking out.

Ms Batty was named Australian of the Year last month after she became a voice for campaigning against family violence when her son, Luke (pictured abovewith her), was killed by her ex-husband

'#qanda is bringing up many emotions tonight. #leavingisthehardest #stillrecovering #strongwoman,' one woman wrote.

While another said: 'Rosie Batty explained so much about the psychology of DV, and not wanting to leave an abusive situation on this evening. Opened my eyes.'

Ms Batty told Daily Mail Australia she was grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the discussion.

'It was a wonderful opportunity on Q&A which is well respected program. It has never been done before [speaking about domestic violence] and it was long overdue. We [the panel] were please with the response we received from the audience,' she said.

In the lead up to the program, there were criticisms about the number of men on the panel compared to women.

But Ms Batty said what was important that the conversation about domestic violence was being discussed.

'It's important to have a variety of people talking,' she said.

'Resources are being cut back and it's really important to have a platform to remind people of the reality of how people are living.'

Last month Ms Batty was named Australian of the Year for her work for campaigning againist family violence.

Ms Batty became an influential figure after her ex-husband killed their son, Luke, during cricket practice in outer Melbourne in February 2014.
