As his new $1.2 million limited edition Bugatti Veyron came off the road three years ago and crashed into three-feet of salt water, driver Andy House had no idea the incident was being filmed.

Veering off the Interstate 45 feeder road in Texas and into La Marque lagoon, auto dealer House told police that he dropped his phone while driving and that when he looked up, he saw a pelican, swerved off the road and crashed.

However, upon filing a $2.2 million claim for the totaled car, House was hit with a lawsuit scheduled to begin in Galveston this week from his Philadelphia insurers who claimed that he was committing fraud because there is no pelican visible in the video.

Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Co. said that it issued the $2.2 million policy on the 2006 Bugatti, of which of only 300 were made, three weeks before the accident.

Using the video evidence in their civil lawsuit, the insurance company also says that House, who owns Performance Auto Sales in Lufkin, made no attempts to brake and he 'intentionally drove the Bugatti into the lagoon to destroy the car and collect proceeds approximately twice the value of the car.'

The East Coast insurance firm also claims that in addition to the video which has been viewed 3.7 million times it has an informant who alleges that House offered him cash to steal the car and set it on fire.

The auto-dealer is counter-suing, demanding the withheld $2.2 million for his ruined super-car.

He declined a request for an interview, but in a statement to ABC News, his attorney said, 'we will not try our case in the media, but will rely on the facts and evidence admitted during the trial of the matter.'

ABC News legal analyst Dana Cole said, 'This video is exhibit A. It is the critical evidence that the insurance company is relying on to void this insurance policy. It is extremely rare to have evidence like this.'

Gilbert Harrison of MCH Truck and Auto, who was called out to tow the vehicle at the time, said Mr House 'took the loss in his stride'.

Philadelphia Indemnity also said that they found no skid marks on the road and said the car expert 'left the vehicle running for over fifteen minutes while it was submerged until it died on its own causing unnecessary damage to the vehicle's engine'.Â
