Mozambique club Ferroviario Maputo paid the price for celebrating their goal against K-Stars when their opponents took advantage of their exuberant celebration by scoring straight from the kick off. 

In the 2015 Future Champions Gauteng International Tournament, where the likes of Sunderland and Orlando Pirates are also taking part, Ferroviario were hoping to take advantage of their first appearance at the annual competition. 

Dos Santos Adriano had given Ferroviario the lead with an impressive free-kick when the whole team, including the goalkeeper, decided to run around the pitch, throw in a few somersaults and make the most of the occasion.

But want happened next was quite astonishing when Zambian side K-Stars took advantage of the overenthusiastic celebration in bizarre fashion. 

The referee allowed K-Stars to kick off while Ferroviario were still soaking up the atmosphere and Kapilingo Francisco lobbed the stray goalkeeper to level the scores with the match finishing 1-1.

It was certainly a goal celebration that Ferroviario won't forget in a hurry.
