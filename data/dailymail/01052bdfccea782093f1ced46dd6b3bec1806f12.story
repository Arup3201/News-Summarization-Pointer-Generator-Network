A former college student who attempted to blow up a Christmas tree lighting was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison today. 

Mohamed Osman Mohamud was just 19-years-old and a student at Oregon State University when he planned to use a car bomb at a holiday celebration in Portland, Oregon.

The bomb he detonated however was a fake, given to him by undercover FBI operatives who then arrested the Somali-American teenager.

Site: The bombing was planned to happen during the lighting of the Christmas tree at Pioneer Square in Portland, Oregon (above), where tens of thousands were gathered

At the time, tens of thousands of people were gathered at Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square for the city's annual tree lighting and holiday celebration.

According to CNN, Mohamud, now 23, had previously told agents, 'I want whoever is attending that event to leave, to leave either dead or injured.' 

Now, a judge has ruled that he will spend 30 years in federal prison, this after he was convicted of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction this past January.

'It's very difficult for me to comprehend how a young man who this country has given great opportunities to could waste those opportunities and be willing to commit a horrific crime,' said Portland Police Chief Michael Reese at the time of the planned bombing. 

'It is very sad.'

Mohamud's defense team had argued that he was entrapped by the FBI.
