A 63-year-old man is desperately trying to reconnect with his first love after a severe bump on the head rekindled his feelings for her.

George Eyres was in a relationship with Sylvia Holland for four years before his family moved to Ireland in the early 1970s, meaning the couple lost contact.

Nearly four decades on, after a head injury brought memories of her flooding back, Mr Eyres would like to reacquaint himself with his long-lost love, who he never really got over.

After the 2010 incident, Mr Eyres underwent an operation to reduce bleeding on his brain and was warned he might lose all of his memories.

Instead, the injuries rekindled his feelings for his long-lost love – and he has put an advert in his local newspaper asking for her to get in touch.

Mr Eyres, who lives in County Meath, said: ‘I’m not sure why we broke up. I’ve regretted not being with her my whole life. It’s only when the memories came back that I realised how much.

‘She would be 61 now and I just want a
chance to get in touch with her. I would love to talk to her and know 
what happened to her.

‘She probably got married and maybe she had children. All I know is that her mother wrote to me that all her dreams came true.’

The pair were an item for four years when they lived next door to each other in Swindon, Wiltshire.

She visited him once for a three week holiday in Ireland, but they then lost touch.

He said: ‘I was a little bit older than Sylvia - she was 19 and I was 20 or 21 years old.

‘We’d been together for three or four years when I went back to Ireland. I didn’t want to go and I was reluctant to leave her.

‘When she came for three weeks, I was struggling financially and I couldn’t go back to Swindon.

‘I wanted to do well in life before I went back. And that was the last time I ever saw her.

‘I had a couple of relationships but nothing compared to what I had with Sylvia. I never really got over her.’

Mr Eyres was injured in October 2010 when he slipped on a wet patch of road when he was walking between two parked cars.

He said: ‘It was the weirdest feeling. I was half-conscious and the only way I can describe it was as though my head was a ton of bricks.’

He was rushed for an emergency operation to reduce bleeding on his brain and spent three weeks in hospital recovering.

Retired George, who worked as a baggage handler at Dublin Airport, said: ‘The surgeon told me I might forget things but it was the total opposite.

‘I could remember things I thought I had forgotten. I could remember Sylvia's facial expressions, the way she used to cover her top lip over her bottom lip when she was shy.

‘She was very shy sometimes back then, but I found it quite endearing.’

He placed the advert in the Swindon Advertiser to track her down last Friday.

He added: ‘I know she is probably married now, and I don't want to cause a fuss or anything, but when I stopped hearing from her mother a few years ago, I feared the worst and it would be nice to just catch up with Sylvia and find out how her life turned out.'
