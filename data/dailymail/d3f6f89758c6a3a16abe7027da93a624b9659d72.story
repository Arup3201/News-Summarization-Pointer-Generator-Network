A retired army officer heckled Philip Hammond during his Tory conference speech today, branding the Defence Secretary a ‘disgrace’.

Colonel Ian Brazier accused Mr Hammond of betraying members of the Royal Fusiliers by cutting the regiment back.

But Mr Hammond insisted the cuts were ordered by army chiefs and not ministers, as union protesters marched on the conference to oppose spending cuts across government.

Mr Hammond was using his keynote address to the Tory conference in Manchester to set out plans to recruit hundreds of part-time web specialists to counter such internet attacks or even ‘to strike in cyber space’.

But he was interrupted by the retired soldier, a Conservative party member, before he was ushered out of the hall by security guards.

Interrupting Mr Hammond's speech in the main hall, retired Colonel Brazier said: ‘Tell the truth about the disbandment of the Fusiliers.

‘I write you letters, you don't respond. The public must know the truth - the Fusiliers are loyal soldiers, you have betrayed them.

‘Sir, you need to be looking at defence. This is denial, not defence. You're a disgrace.’

The 2nd battalion fusiliers, who also held a protest outside the conference centre, was formed in 1968 have served in Cyprus, Germany, Northern Ireland, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Speaking outside the main hall to 
reporters, Col Brazier, chairman of the Fusiliers Association, said he 
was speaking on ‘behalf of all retired fusiliers’.

He was accompanied by Captain Joe Eastwood, 76, from Cambridge, when he interrupted Mr Hammond.

Colonel Brazier, 59, added: ‘I am very angry about the fact the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (2RRF), is to be disbanded.

‘The MoD are not answering our questions, it (the process) has not been open and therefore I am left with no choice.

‘I have asked, I have written, I have petitioned - I have been denied, it has been denied evaded and avoided and yes I am angry. My soldiers, the people I had the honour to serve with have been betrayed.

Protest: Away from the conference hall thousands of people marched through the streets of Manchester in support of a variety of causes including the National Health Service

‘We cannot operate as an armed force, when we are talking about being the force largest defence budget.’

He continued: ‘It's not just 
about reviews and money. I know Mr Hammond is a banker and he obviously 
behaves like one. What he has to do is look at the need. Of course there
have to be cuts but make them rational, make them about manning, make 
them about capability, make them about recruiting.’

He said Mr Hammond should now be replaced as Defence Secretary by somebody ‘who knows what they are doing’.

However Mr Hammond insisted the decision was made by the Army. ‘If they'd stayed in the hall a bit longer they would have heard the case that I was building in my speech for why we have to invest in the new capabilities we need to defend Britain,’ he told Sky News.

‘While we all cherish our military traditions - and we have great regiments with proud histories - we have to reduce the size of our conventional armed forces as we are investing for example in new cyber.

‘The Army has made the decision about 
how it needs to restructure to be able to defend Britain in the future 
with a smaller army than we've had in the past.

‘These two RRF guys - the campaign's been long running - they know very well the point that we are making.’

Elsewhere around 40,000 people marched through Manchester on a union protest against austerity cuts and public service reforms.

The protest is highlighting the impact of Government policies on jobs and spending across the health service, as well as the 'rapid sell-off' of the most lucrative parts of the NHS to private healthcare companies.

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Austerity is having a devastating effect on our communities and services, with 21,000 NHS jobs lost over the last three months alone.

'The NHS is one of Britain's finest achievements and we will not allow ministers to destroy, through cuts and privatisation, what has taken generations to build.'
