A dentist who bought one of John Lennon's rotten teeth at auction for nearly £20,000 now wants to use it to create a clone of the assassinated musician.

Dentist Michael Zuk, 51, from Alberta in Canada, who bought the Beatle’s molar by telephone bid at an auction two years ago, announced his plan on BBC radio this morning.

He told BBC Radio 5 Live breakfast: 'Many people have thought about cloning famous people and I think John Lennon should be at the top of the heap.'

Yellow: John Lennon's tooth, which dentist Michael Zuk from Canada wants to use to clone the Beatle

Mr Zuk said that the next step would be to extract Lennon's genetic sequence from the yellowed wisdom tooth he had in his position.

'From there its just a matter of sitting around waiting for the technology to advance just a little bit longer because they are already cloning animals from small amounts of DNA,' he added.

'So we have some time to think about all the different considerations.'

Assassinated: Lennon, who was shot dead in 1980, gave the tooth to his housekeeper after he had it pulled. It was put up for auction in 2011 by her son

He went on: 'When people are doing genetic clones they actually get an exact replica of the person or animal that they are bringing back.

'I believe they are doing it with race horses already and with people's favourite pets, so it's already being done.'

John Lennon gave the tooth to his housekeeper Dorothy Jarlett, who between 1964 and 1968 lived in Weybridge, Surrey.

She later moved to Canada where she married and had kept it with her ever since.

The Beatle's former employee is now 90 and her son Barry Jarlett decided to sell it so that the 'unique' piece of memorabilia is not lost.

John Lennon, who was shot dead in 1980, formed a close bond with Miss Jarlett. He also gave her a pearl necklace and a wallet which the family are planning to keep.

The pensioner provided an affidavit to confirm that the tooth was genuine.

Mr Zuk bought the tooth, which he says is probably a wisdom tooth, after it was sold through Omega Auctions in Stockport, Greater Manchester, in 2011.

At the time he said he was ‘buzzing’ after the purchase, adding that it would join his collection of dinosaur teeth.
