A huge earthquake hit just south west of Alaska this morning, threatening a devastating tsunami.

People living in coastal areas were told to leave their homes immediately and flee inland to higher ground after the 6.8 magnitude quake struck close to the Aleutian Islands, 1,031 miles away from Anchorage.

Widespread damage was at one point feared across the West Coast - from British Columbia, Canada, to Washington - as towns braced themselves for oncoming waves.

Frightening: The earthquake hit just over 1,000 miles south west of Anchorage, Alaska

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued the tsunami warning this morning, stating that residents should flee their homes immediately.

'Those feeling the earth shake, seeing unusual wave action, or the water level rising or receding may have only a few minutes before the tsunami arrival and should move immediately.

'Homes and small buildings are not designed to withstand tsunami impacts. Do not stay in these structures,' the warning read.

'Earthquakes of this magnitude are known to generate tsunamis,' the message added.

The quake, which struck at 6:55 a.m. EDT, was 22.1 miles deep, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.

The tsunami warning has since been cancelled but people in Pacific coastal regions outside California, Oregon, Washington, British 
Columbia, and Alaska have been told to check updates for fear of damage.

Last week, terrifying tremors were felt in New York, Washington D.C. and as far north as Toronto when America's East Coast was struck by the biggest earthquake in over a century.

Major buildings, including the Pentagon and the White House had to be evacuated and several top tourist attractions in Washington have been closed for safety reasons after the city was shaken by a 5.8-magnitude quake, which originated in Virginia.

Flights from JFK in New York and Reagan National Airport in Washington were also temporarily suspended while the airports checked for runway damage.
