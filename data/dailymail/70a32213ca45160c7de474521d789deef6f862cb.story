Detective Constable Adele Cashman died of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome after chasing two muggers

A 'super-fit' detective who collapsed after chasing muggers who had stolen an iPhone was killed by a problem with her heart, an inquest found today.

Witnesses said DC Adele Cashman, 30, appeared 'really tired' before falling to the ground on bonfire night last year.

Colleagues who had also been chasing two suspects in Belsize Park, north London, immediately came to her aid.

She was rushed to the Royal Free Hospital but was pronounced dead an hour later.

Her parents said today that their daughter died 'doing what she loved'.

A hearing at St Pancras Coroners Court was told she died from a fatal cardiac dysrhythmia in a morphologically normal heart.

DC Cashman had been chasing two boys who had allegedly snatched a mobile phone from a 59-year-old woman in Haverstock Hill.

Two 17-year-olds were later each given a six month referral orders for stealing the £550 iPhone5.

Her parents Geoff and Lorraine said: 'Adele died on duty, serving the public, doing what she loved, working for the Metropolitan Police.

'Adele achieved a lot in her short life, she travelled the world, was well educated and she lived life to the full.

Police officers lay flowers outside a tent where Detective Constable Adele Cashman collapsed. Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Tucker said DC Cashman was a 'much loved and wholly dedicated officer'

'We as a family are greatly comforted
by the many tributes received from her friends and workmates and by 
knowing how many people really knew and loved her.

'We
would like to thank the police and our family and friends for their 
unending support and help during these very difficult times.'

Cardiac arrhythmias are linked to sudden adult death syndrome, which kills up to 500 people in the UK 
every yea.

DC Cashman joined the Metropolitan Police in 2006 and was made detective constable in Camden in 2010.

The hearing today heard she had not 
suffered any health problems in the run up to her death and regularly 
went to the gym and planned to run a marathon.

Her close friend and colleague Claire 
Hart, who had recently been on holiday with DC Cashman, said she had 
never even known her to have a cold.

In a statement she said: 'I'm completely devastated as to understand how someone so young could die like this.'

The coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe has recommended that members of DC Cashman's family now be screened

DC Cashman's partner Colin Baker said they had gone out for a meal the 
night before she died and she had seemed fine. The last text he got from
her was at 9.18pm on November 5.

Fifty minutes later she collapsed on the pavement in Belsize Park Gardens.

Witness
Juliet Butcher, who saw the moment DC Cashman fell, said: 'She looked 
really tired. She was staggering then she collapsed on the ground.

'I watched to see if she got up but when she didn't I went out to see if she was okay.'

Within minutes DC Cashman's colleagues were on the scene and an ambulance was called.

But despite having heart compressions for nearly an hour there was no response.

Pathologist Dr Simon Poole said a post mortem showed no suspicious circumstances and toxicology tests proved negative.

The officer's brain and heart were sent off for further examination but experts were again unable to find any abnormalities.

Dr Poole said: 'By process of elimination
she is more likely to have died from a sudden and unpredicted 
disturbance in the electrical activity in the heart which caused her 
collapse and death.

Flowers and messages laid in tribute to Dc Cashman. Her parents today said she died doing the job 'she loved'

Cardiac dysrhythmia is a condition in which there is abnormal electrical activity in the heart, causing it to beat too fast or too slow, and may be regular or irregular.

According to the NHS, Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias), are experienced by over 1million people a year in the UK.

Certain types can cause sudden cardiac death, which kills 100,000 people a year in the UK. 

Some arrhythmias are life-threatening medical emergencies that can result in cardiac arrest and sudden death.

Others cause symptoms such as an abnormal awareness of heart beat (palpitations).

Some types of arrhythmia can cause symptoms such as an abnormal awareness of heart beat, while others do not cause symptoms at all. 

Increased risks include stroke, heart failure and sudden cardiac death.

Cardiac arrhythmias are a common cause of sudden adult death syndrome, which kills up to 500 people in the UK every year, and may be genetic.

'This is clearly unusual but it is a well documented phenomenon in young people who are otherwise fit and healthy.'

It has since emerged that DC Cashman's mother suffers with a heart abnormality.

Detective
Chief Superintendent Richard Tucker, Acting Borough Commander for 
Camden, said: 'Adele was a much loved and wholly dedicated officer. It 
is always devastating when a colleague loses their life, especially when
it is someone so young who devotes their life to keeping others safe.

'Adele
was such an officer and was held in very high regard by all who met her
- she continues to be sorely missed by everyone at Camden who had the 
privilege of working alongside her.'

St
Pancras coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe recommended members of the 
officer's family now be screened in case they are also affected.

Giving a ruling of natural causes she said the police chase had no bearing on the death as it 'could have occurred at any time.'

She added: 'Adele Cashman was a young, healthy serving police officer who had no risk factors which were obvious at the time.

'There was some family history of potential congenital cardiac dysrhythmia.

'The
pathologist has concluded this is a death from natural causes due to 
inherited abnormalities of the electrical components in her heart 
structure.

'I'm 
recommending her family undergo screening to make sure they are not 
similarly affected and I want to convey my deepest condolences to them.'

DC Cashman lived in St Albans with friends. Her family are from Somerset but did not attend the inquest.

Her brother Adam and Claire Hart are running the London Marathon on
April 21 in her memory, to raise money for charity Cots For Tots.
