It was one of those unavoidably surreal moments in broadcasting history.

BBC presenters Julian Worricker and Sophie 
Long were delivering the news from one side of a glass-screen studio 
when a small figure in a turquoise coat loomed into view on the newsroom
 behind them.

The Queen was shown surrounded and all but mobbed by 
dozens of staff, apparently ignoring instructions to remain in their 
seats as the monarch toured the building.

Newsflash: Presenters Julian Worricker and Sophie Long turn round to find the Queen has turned up during one their bulletins

Caught unawares: The newsreaders appeared a little flustered as their celebrity guest appeared in the background

Earlier she had sat motionless as she 
listened to a special performance in the ‘Live Lounge’. Just for a moment, she seemed somewhat alone.

Pensive: The Queen on a visit to the BBC yesterday, as Prince Philip underwent abdominal surgery

The cameras fleetingly caught her 
looking reflective, the briefest of expressions to confirm there was a 
great deal on the Queen’s mind yesterday.

In
 different circumstances the Duke of Edinburgh would have been at her 
side for this, one of hundreds of engagements they carry out together 
throughout a busy working year.

But yesterday – not for the first time – she found herself unexpectedly on a solo mission to maintain business as usual .

The Queen is 
known to be a fan of classical music but she was treated to a rendition 
of David Bowie’s ‘Heroes’ – which became a theme song for the Olympics –
 by Irish band The Script.

At
 the end she chatted briefly to Script lead singer and Voice host Danny 
O’Donoghue and when she learnt he was playing the Glastonbury festival, 
joked about the mud.

She said: ‘Glastonbury, the place you get covered 
in mud? The singer replied with a laugh: ‘You’ve got to bring good 
wellies.’

The Queen was at the BBC’s new 
£1billion Broadcasting House headquarters on the fringes of the West 
End, a tour that had been on each of their diaries for months. A 
thousand yards away, the Duke was preparing to go under anaesthetic for 
an operation at The London Clinic.

For
 each of these two most senior royals, at a time when they are gently 
being advised to pull back from the most arduous engagements they 
undertake, more lone appearances such as this could easily be a taste of
 the future.

He will not be alongside her for two key events next week, Beating Retreat, and Trooping the Colour.

Speech: Speaking on Radio 4 and the World Service she said how she had been to the original Broadcasting House with her parents before the war and then later before her Coronation, with Prince Philip

Happy: The Queen looked relaxed as Buckingham Palace said Prince Philip is 'progressing satisfactorily' after his operation

Not
 that you would otherwise have detected any sign of easing off 
yesterday, despite the last-minute logistical difficulties of turning a 
two-person tour into one.

Prince
 Philip (‘Do I look bloody ill?’, as he angrily once put it) might not 
have been cracking as many jokes as he had done at a Palace garden party
 some 24 hours earlier, but even from his hospital bed, it is safe to 
assume he would have wondered what all the fuss was about.

The Queen, meanwhile, maintained her 
usual calm, although she did have to unveil a yet-to-be corrected plaque
 that declared she was accompanied by Prince Philip.

Then she had to fend off a question 
from fearless veteran broadcaster John Humphrys, apparently the only BBC
 soul bold enough to ask how her husband was. ‘I have no idea,’ she 
said, looking slightly displeased. ‘He’s only just gone in.’ 

Her
 Majesty was escorted around the recently revamped building on a day 
when she and the Duke were making headlines around the world. ‘Is that 
me?’ she enquired, watching herself on the news screens.

All smiles: The presenters turned around and laughed when they realised Britain's monarch was standing behind them in the studio

Chat: She spoke to lead singer  Danny O'Donoghue of The Script, and they briefly discussed Glastonbury, with her Majesty saying he should be careful of the mud

Royal performance: The Script played a cover of David Bowie's track 'Heroes' which became a theme song for the Olympics

Reflection: Only on once occasion did the Queen look to have something on her mind as she sat in the BBC's Live Lounge

Daley was joined by Doctor Who actress Jenna-Louise Coleman also came to

Brave: The Queen still managed to  smile despite being forced to visit BBC  Broadcasting House without her beloved husband Prince Philip, who is in hospital nearby

She seemed unimpressed by the modern music (although she did volunteer later she was a big fan of EastEnders).

Two more familiar icons of entertainment – Sir Bruce Forsyth and a Dalek – were among those who paid their respects. Brucie said afterwards it was ‘a great shame’ the Duke could not attend the opening.

Her encounter with Humphrys came before the Today Programme stalwart presented her with a special edition digital radio.

He wished her many happy hours of listening to the radio, only to be told rather waspishly: ‘Well I don’t get a lot of (time)...to listen to the radio.’

She was later shown an original television camera used during the Coronation broadcast, and was introduced to Sylvia Peters, the BBC announcer who introduced the coverage back in 1953.

Miss Peters spoke to her about how people’s voices tend to get lower over the years. ‘I hadn’t noticed that,’ said the Queen, adding: ‘Maybe one’s been getting deaf.’

Aside from her reflective moment, the 
Queen looked relaxed and at ease, appearing to enjoy meeting famous 
faces from television and radio. Hundreds of BBC staff lined the 
approach to the new building yesterday, many waving Union Jacks.

Meet and greet: Sir Bruce Forsyth and his wife, 
former Miss World Wilnelia Merced, as well as veteran broadcaster David 
Dimbleby also met the Queen

Nice to meet you: The Queen says hello to Sir Bruce Forsyth with Dvid Dimbleby, Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman

Scores of office workers and shoppers also paused to watch the Queen arrive and depart, following the BBC journalists’ lead to take souvenir snapshots on their mobile phone cameras.

Outside in the crowd, Iris McIntosh carried a ‘Get Well Soon’ card she planned to deliver to the clinic afterwards. ‘I’ve always liked the Duke,’ the 66-year-old charity worker said. ‘Of all the older royals, he seems to be the most down to earth.’

For all the proud history of Broadcasting House, possibly one of the most familiar addresses in the land, the Queen was still able to put it all into context. She was already six when the building was opened in 1932. She first visited it in 1939, when she was still princess Elizabeth, accompanying her father King George VI, and subsequently made four more visits, not including this one.

In a live broadcast yesterday she said it was ‘a great pleasure’ to come again, adding: ‘I hope this new building will serve you well in the future.’
