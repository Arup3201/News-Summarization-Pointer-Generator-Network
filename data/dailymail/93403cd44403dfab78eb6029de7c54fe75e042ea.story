Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar?

Brazil has woken to realise it was not all a mind-bending dream of disturbing contradictions. Yes, the World Cup hosts are into the last four.

And, yes, Neymar is out of the competition, injured in a quite innocuous incident at the fag-end of a chaotic quarter-final against Colombia.

'To win the Cup without him?' asked Fortaleza-based newspaper O Povo on its front page; a headline to accompany the image of Neymar being carted from the pitch in the city's Castelao Stadium.

'Gained but lost,' was another headline and 'Joy and Sorrow' declared Diario do Nordeste, with a split front page to mirror the ecstatic features of David Luiz after his goal from a free-kick, Brazil’s second in a 2-1 win, and the tragic early exit of Neymar prone on a stretcher with his face screwed up in pain.

Agony: Neymar lies in agony after being kneed in the back just three mintues from the end

Stretchered off: Neymar is carried away by medics leaving all Brazilian fans in a state of panic

Carried away: Neymar was stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital after Brazil's quarter-final win

There were detailed diagrams to explain how Brazil’s poster-boy had a tiny crack in the third vertebra, near the bottom of his spine, in more or less the area where Juan Zuniga connected with his knee.

Outside in the streets of Fortaleza, the debris from a night of muted celebration was being cleared and market traders were adorning their stalls once again with replica Brazil shirts with 'Neymar Jr' and a No 10 emblazoned on the back.

He seems set to remain the commercial force of the World Cup but Luiz Felipe Scolari must begin the process of finding a creative force to replace his playmaker on the pitch, ahead of a semi-final against Germany.

Scolari must lift the spirits, convince the nation this campaign does not end with the exit of Neymar and a one-match ban for captain Thiago Silva, also ruled out of Tuesday’s game in Belo Horizonte. More than that, he must convince his team.

The gloom descended as Brazil’s players shuffled through what is called the 'Mixed Zone', the area set aside by FIFA where players are made available for interview after each game. It is a snaking route like you might find at an airport or in a post office.

The first to emerge told how they would pray for Neymar’s speedy recovery, how important he was to their progress. By the time the final ones trailed through, an hour or so later, the reports from the hospital were filtering though.

Neymar was definitely out, according to Brazilian broadcasters as they buzzed around. The team doctor had confirmed it. This news was relayed to players as they were interviewed and the tone altered from one of hope and optimism to one of sadness and regret.

Cynical: With the ball nowhere near Zuniga smashed his knee into the lower part of Neymar's back

The damage: Brazilian television stations obtained an x-ray of Neymar's back and highlighted the broken bone

Welcome back: There were emotional scenes as Neymar was greeted by his team-mates upon returning to the base at Teresopolis

Oscar had already climbed aboard the bus and as he wakes this morning, he will find millions of hopeful eyes turning in his direction, just like when he carried the famous No 10 on his back, as he did until last year.

Scolari 'demoted' Oscar to No 11 and the quiet and diligent Chelsea midfielder was forced wider to accommodate Neymar in the same way he was often forced out wide at Stamford Bridge until Jose Mourinho arrived and sold Juan Mata.

Despite Mata’s brilliance over two years in London, Mourinho’s decision did not seem entirely absurd because Oscar started last season in wonderful touch. There were goals, assists and shimmies and feints, combined with wiry strength and an appetite to work hard and contribute defensively.

As the season went on he faded, however, prompting the Chelsea manager to wonder aloud if he did not like the winter weather. There were flickers and moments of quality but Oscar could not reproduce his early-season form. He has scored only twice in the last 18 games for his club, two goals in the same game against Arsenal.

Room for improvement: Oscar will be expected to step up in the absence of Neymar against Germany

At this World Cup, too, he has been subdued. There was a 90th-minute goal against Croatia but he has been largely eclipsed by Neymar’s goals and public dazzle, even though giant billboard posters of Oscar with Calvin Klein pants and six-pack on display are a frequent sight around Brazil.

This is the time to reclaim his place as playmaker for the Selecao. If they are to survive this setback and win a sixth world title in the Maracana, then they need Oscar to spark into life. Brazil needs the sublime and creative Oscar who marked his first Chelsea start with two magical goals in the Champions League against Juventus.

He is still only 22, seven months younger than Neymar, who was the youngest Brazilian to carry the honour (or is it a burden, these days) of wearing the No 10 at a World Cup. Oscar will continue to wear No 11 but he must start to think again like a No 10.

There is no doubt he has the craft and the vision although - more than an individualist like Neymar, he thrives on the movement of others around him: runners to thread passes to, team-mates on his wavelength to combine with.

Expectation: Oscar and quarter-final hero David Luiz (right) have the weight of Brazil on their shoulders

Vision: The Chelsea midfielder relies on the movement of his team-mates to get the best out of himself

He certainly can threaten goal if he is moved into the centre as many expect he will be in Scolari’s enforced reshuffle, to play behind centre-forward Fred, with his Chelsea team-mate Willian and Bernard of Shakhtar Donetsk the leading candidates to come into the team.

Brazil’s Chelsea connection will be strengthened if Willian gets the nod. David Luiz may be bound for Paris St Germain but he remains a Blue for the moment, and Ramires has made important contributions albeit mostly from the bench in Scolari’s team.

The Londoners can lay claim to the fab four if Brazil achieve their dream, just as Arsenal claimed to be the driving force behind France’s world title in 1998 and West Ham with England in 1966.

If that is to become reality, it is time for Oscar to step forward and deliver. To prove they can do it without Neymar.

It is time for Brazil's other No 10 to step forward.
