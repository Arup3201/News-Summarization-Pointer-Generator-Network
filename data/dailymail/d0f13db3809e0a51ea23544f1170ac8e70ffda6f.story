Maybe there's something about the royal family that makes them hard to paint?

It seems Kate Middleton isn't the only one who artists have had trouble recreating on canvas.

This portrait of the Queen painted 60 years ago was rejected because critics said it looked nothing like her and her neck was 'too long'.

This portrait of the Queen by John Napper was rejected after criticis said it looked nothing like her in 1952

Much better: Her Majesty the Queen pictured in 1953 in Buckingham Palace. The John Napper portrait was said to look nothing like her

The painting by John Napper was especially commissioned by Liverpool Town Hall for the Queen's Coronation in 1953.

But it faced such criticism at the time it was quickly shelved and Napper was sent back to the drawing board to start again.

A second version with a shorter neck was eventually accepted.

Last
week Kate Middleton's first official portrait faced a barrage of 
withering criticism from art lovers who branded it 'rotten', 'ghastly' 
and 'ordinary'.

Paul 
Emsley's painting was also subjected to a deluge of Photoshop 
alterations by amateur artists who then posted their work on Twitter and
Facebook.

The Duchess of Cambridge was more polite, insisting she was 'thrilled' with the oil painting and praising it as 'amazing'.

Another royal portrait which was slammed by art critics has gone on display at Liverpool Town Hall

Artist Paul Emsley has faced a slew of criticism for his portrait of Kate Middleton which some of has said makes her look much older

Mr Napper, who died in 2001, famously said of his first effort: 'It's a beautiful painting of a queen, but not this Queen'.

He also painted Winston Churchill but his best works were said to be his still lives which attracted the praise of Prince Charles.

Trustees at St George's Hall in 
Liverpool have announced the portrait will be permanently showcased
there to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation.

Liverpool's deputy Lord Mayor Gary 
Millar said: "We are very proud that Liverpool 
now has the original first painting hanging in St George's Hall, which 
has been rehung to celebrate the anniversary of the Queen's Coronation.

'It
will be the first thing people will see if they come to get married or 
have a civil partnership or attend a citizenship ceremony.'
