Ministers were today accused of being so desperate to sell off Royal Mail they were prepared to accept 'any cost'.

MPs on the influential Business Select Committee attacked the Government for privatising the company on the cheap - leaving taxpayers more than £1billion out of pocket.

But Business Secretary Vince Cable and Business Minister Michael Fallon insisted the sale, last October, had been a success.

Tory MP Brian Binley said the claim was 'absolutely Alice In Wonderland'.

Business Secretary Vince Cable has come under fire from all sides over his handling of the controversial Royal Mail sell-off

Mr Cable claimed Royal Mail workers were to blame for the low share price - for threatening to go on strike over pay.

He said that two weeks of strike action by the Communication Workers Union would have 'wiped out' the company's profits.

The Lib Dem minister said: 'One of the key uncertainties was the threat of industrial action. We could have found ourselves selling in significantly worse conditions.'

Mr Fallon added: 'It is the one missing piece of this whole story: had we got a pay deal on time, from April 1 last year, and had a settled industrial relations climate, it is wholly possible that we could have achieved a higher price at the sale.'

Union chief Billy Hayes attacked the claim and demanded Mr Cable resign or be sacked.

He said: 'For Cable and Fallon to continue to claim industrial action was the main reason they sold Royal Mail at a low share price is utterly ridiculous.

'The Committee heard that 'relatively few days had been lost to industrial action'. The shares were 24 times oversubscribed so for the Government to say they wouldn't have been able to get a good deal for the taxpayer is wrong.'

He accused Mr Cable of being 'completely incapable or downright careless'.

Mr Hayes said: 'It's clear Cable needs to go - this is a man who lost the taxpayer a billion pounds.

'A postal worker who lost a valuable item would be sacked and the same standard needs to apply to Mr Cable - he can't carry on as Secretary of State.

'It's beyond belief that the Government see nothing wrong with the sell-off and that shows the fundamental difference between them and Britain.'

Mr Fallon told the committee that he stuck by the initial share price at the time of last year's flotation - even though the value of shares soared by 38% on their first day on offer.

Mr Cable also claimed that the world economy was in much better shape than it was at the time of the flotation - allowing the company's share price to rise.

But the Lib Dem minister accepted that there had been a big surge in the valuation of the company since the government sold it off.

Mr Cable said: 'It is true there is a very high level of volatility in the share price.'

But he insisted that Royal Mail was 'still a fragile company' whose shares could go up or down.

The Committee's chair Adrian Bailey claimed the approach of the Government was to sell the Royal Mail at any cost, with value for money for the taxpayer only a secondary consideration.

He added that there was 'robust evidence' that the shares were under-valued.

Mr Bailey said: 'The whole approach of the ministers I find quite bizarre in terms of selling something.

'The approach of the department seems to have dwelt on the negative, which if you are selling something - and particularly when that something is a public asset that the public were entitled to get money for - seems, quite frankly, utterly ridiculous.'

But Mr Fallon said: 'I don't accept that. It was a successful flotation.

'I have not seen any evidence that the shares were under-valued at the time of the flotation. I stick by the share price.'

Tory MP Brian Binley said the level of interest in the shares, which were oversubscribed many times, should have led the Government to consider a higher price.

He asked Mr Fallon: 'Are you generally telling me that all of that oversubscription would have fallen away if those shares had been priced at higher than 330p?'

But Mr Fallon told him: 'Facebook was oversubscribed by 25 times, it fell 10% on the first day of trading. There is no link between oversubscription and the actual price.'

Labour committee member Katy Clark told the ministers: 'You were the custodians of a public asset. The impression that's been given is that you were not going to let anything stand in the way of selling off this asset as soon as possible and anything that might cause delay was just going to be swept aside.'

Mr Fallon told her: 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I'm quite confident we got the best price we could at that particular time bearing in mind all the circumstances.'

Mr Bailey said: 'That's absolutely Alice In Wonderland. The fact is that you didn't get the best price because on the day of sale the share prices soared. That's just an astonishing assertion.'

The minister responded: 'That was on a small number of shares. There is no evidence that people would have paid more than 330p for 600 million shares, whatever they were prepared to pay for a handful of shares on the day.'

Labour's Willie Bain said: 'I think the public will be flabbergasted that ministers are happy with the advice that has been tendered given that they have foregone hundreds of millions of pounds as a result of this flawed transaction.'

He added: 'No one put the long-term return to the taxpayer first.'

Mr Cable insisted: 'We were overwhelmingly concerned with the long-term interests of the taxpayer. That is what drove the whole process.'

Royal Mail workers were unhappy with the sell-off - despite receiving free shares from the Government as a sweetener

Mr Fallon added: 'Two years ago we had a loss-making Royal Mail. Today we have one of Britain's top 100 companies, with every prospect of a secure future and able to deliver on a sustainable basis the six-day-a-week service that our constituents rely on. That's a success.'

The Business Secretary acknowledged that there were lessons to be learned about the way privatisations were handled, but insisted he had nothing to apologise for over the Royal Mail sell-off.

He said: 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but on the basis of the facts we had, the information we had, the knowledge we had of the company, this was a successful transaction.

'We don't apologise for it and don't regret it.'

He added: 'The lesson to be learned from this whole exercise is 'is this the best system for getting the maximum value for taxpayer assets?'

'We accept the need to look at different methods and I suspect we may come back to the conclusion that the IPO route was the only one that made any sense.'

When the Royal Mail floated last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was looking for long-term stability from ‘the right kind of investor community’.

As a result, 16 of the City’s investment giants were singled out from the 796 which wanted to buy shares and given favoured status.

This group was awarded a much larger tranche of shares – about £46million worth each – while 506 received nothing and the rest between £600,000 and £6million worth.

But few of the ‘priority’ investors – believed to include Legal & General, Threadneedle, BlackRock, and Fidelity – have been as long-term in their approach as Mr Cable had hoped.

The NAO said: ‘Almost half of the shares allocated to them had been sold within weeks.’

In one example, Standard Life bought nearly 12million shares in October, but now owns just 118,480.

On the first day of trading last year, Royal Mail's shares closed at 455p, 38 per cent higher than their sale price.

This meant the shares were £750 million higher on their first day of trading than the government sold them for.

The National Audit Office said Mr Cable's department took a 'cautious' approach to a number of issues, which led to shares being priced at a level 'substantially below' the initial trading price.

The Government could have kept 110 million more shares, worth £363 million at the 330p offer price, while still privatising the business, the NAO report said.

Today's committee hearing follows a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee yesterday at which a city regulator said the spike in the share price of Royal Mail on the day of privatisation was at the 'top end' of what would be expected when a firm floated - but insisted there was no need to launch an inquiry into the sale.

Financial Conduct Authority chief executive Martin Wheatley said there was nothing to suggest a failure of regulation about the way the shares were sold.

He told the MPs: 'If you wanted to look at where the failure was, the failure was in the pricing decision, not in the regulation.'

Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge called for an inquiry into whether investment banks involved in the sale had properly followed the rules preventing them sharing information with their asset management arms, which were allocated Royal Mail shares.

The NAO report said that of the seven investment banks in the syndicate that advised the Government on the sell-off, at least five were given shares on behalf of their asset management arms for distribution to their clients.
