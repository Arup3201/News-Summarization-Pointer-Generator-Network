A singer who created a custom song for a newlywed couple has revealed the lyrics about falling and climbing up hills that seem spooky now that the wife admitted to killing her husband by pushing him off a cliff.

Jordan Linn Graham has been released from police custody after allegedly telling police that she and her husband Cody were fighting during a hike and she ended up shoving him to his death.

Jordan, 22, has been put under house arrest and is wearing a GPS monitoring bracelet while she stays at her parents' Kalispell, Montana home until her trial.

The latest revelations about the seemingly prophetic song now adds another layer of intrigue to the case, as the woman who wrote the song said that she came up with the lyrics based on a series of interviews with the couple before their wedding.

'I used words like "you helped me to climb higher for a better view, you're my safe place to fall, you never let me go,"' songwriter Elizabeth Shea told CNN.

'Now when I hear those words, it's a little creepy.'

Judge Donald Molloy determined Friday that 22-year-old Jordan Linn Graham does not pose a flight risk.

Molloy said during a brief hearing that restrictions placed on Graham's release address concerns that she poses a risk to the community or herself.

Under the conditions for her house arrest Graham must live at her parents home in Kalispell, undergo a mental health evaluation and submit to radio frequency monitoring.

Authorities say Graham has admitted to shoving Cody Lee Johnson, 25, off a cliff in Glacier on the night of July 7 during an argument.

According to charging documents Graham had been having second thoughts about getting married around the time the body of her husband was discovered.

Her release comes a day after Montana prosecutors revealed that an email was allegedly sent from a man named 'Tony' while Graham's husband was still missing.

The email, sent three days after Cody Lee Johnson went missing, claimed he had fallen and died after going hiking with three friends.

According to the affidavit, the message also suggested 'the search should be called off', according to the Missoulian.

However, the email was traced to a 
computer belonging to Graham's stepfather Steven Rutledge, and it found 
to have been written on the day the gmail account it was sent from was 
created, FBI Special Agent Steven Liss said. She made her confession to 
police only after this email had been sent.

Her
 25-year-old husband died on July 7 and Graham allegedly confessed to 
pushing him on July 16, but she wasn't arrested on second-degree murder 
charges until Monday.

When 
she interviewed by the police on July 18, Graham admitted that she had 
lied about the death of her husband and provided false statements, 
according to ABC News.

Graham posted this photo around the time of Cody Johnson's death. She said she was doing some 'modeling' after a night of bowling

Graham posted this photo to Instagram in December 2012 with the caption: 'He proposed!! Best early Christmas present ever!! :)'
