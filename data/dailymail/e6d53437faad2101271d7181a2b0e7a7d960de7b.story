Attack: Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite warns Labour to prepare for an early general election

The leader of the country's biggest trade union has warned of more co-ordinated strikes across Britain as anger mounts over pay freezes and job cuts - on the same day more than 50,000 Revenue and Customs workers are downing tools in protest at 'massive cuts'.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of 
Unite, warned that industrial action over pay, pensions and cuts to 
public services is 'inevitable' and will continue until the next polling day.

He has urged Labour to prepare for an early
general election because of the continuing economic uncertainty and 
anger over the Government's policies.

Meanwhile, members of the Public and 
Commercial Services union (PCS) are striking today claiming job cuts are undermining efforts to clamp down on tax avoidance schemes.

They will take action across the UK, warning 
that the walkout will close offices and leave telephone calls 
unanswered.

It comes as it emerged HMRC doesn't have the resources to deal with more than 20,0000 tax tribunal cases where billions of pounds of potential revenue is tied up.

The backlog is so huge it will take 38 years to clear at the current rate, according to The Times.

In the past year there have been a series of national strikes held by public sector workers, while teachers are threatening co-ordinated action in the autumn and doctors took industrial action last week for the first time in almost 40 years, while police and prison officers have also staged demonstrations.

'This campaign will run and run, probably up to the next election,' said Mr McCluskey ahead of Unite's national conference which opens in Brighton on Monday.

'Governments that don't listen to the concerns of ordinary people tend to get turfed out of office. There will be further campaigns and further strikes and all this will be a major issue at the next election.'

He told the BBC that further strikes were 'inevitable'.

Mr McCluskey said Labour has to 'get its act together' and prepare for a general election in 2014, a year earlier than the next poll is due.

'The Labour Party would be sensible to prepare for an election. These are extraordinary times - none of us have been here before, no-one knows what is around the corner.

'Anything can happen, but I hope people don't forget the ineptitude of this government and the blame they are trying to put on workers for the economic crisis.'

Mr McCluskey who will make his keynote speech to delegates on Monday, said workers desperately needed hope amid the government's austerity measures and 'attacks' on public services, adding it was 'frightening' that most of the spending cuts haven't been implemented yet.

He said the 'attack' on millions of hardworking families is 'forfeiting the (government's right to rule'.

He urged Labour leader Ed Miliband, who addresses the conference later this week, to give details of the party's alternative to the government's policies.

Unite has been involved in a spate of industrial disputes this year involving fuel tanker drivers, public sector workers and London bus drivers, who went on strike on Friday in a row over an Olympic bonus payment. 'It can only get worse,' added the Unite leader.

The PCS union say job cuts are undermining efforts to investigate tax avoidance schemes like the one used by comedian Jimmy Carr

The PCS union said 30,000 jobs have been axed since 2005 and a further 10,000 are set to go, 'undermining' efforts to investigate schemes such as the one used by comedian Jimmy Carr, which sparked a political row last week.

The PCS said an estimated £120 billion was lost every year because of tax evasion and avoidance, claiming that HMRC did not have enough resources to tackle the problem.

The strike is also in opposition to 'creeping privatisation' in the department, which is currently trialling the use of private firms to handle tax credit inquiries.

The strike will be followed by other forms of action such as a ban on overtime.

PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'It is sickening to see millionaires in the cabinet wringing their hands about the immorality of tax avoidance when it is their lack of political will to act that means we lose tens of billions of pounds every year.

'The case for investment in our public services as an alternative to austerity could not be more obvious than it is in HMRC. Yet the government wants to cut 10,000 more jobs from the department, letting the wealthy tax dodgers off the hook and punishing the rest of us for a recession we did not cause.'

An HM Revenue & Customs spokesman said: 'HMRC is disappointed with the decision to strike and will do everything it can to maintain services to the public.

Upset: Protesters march with placards in London in November last year when more than two million public sector workers staged a nationwide strike

'We are seeking dialogue with the PCS to address their concerns and will work to minimise any disruption to our customers.

'In our 2010 spending review the Government made £917m available to us to tackle avoidance, evasion and fraud.

'This is being used to increase our tax take from compliance work by £7bn a year in 2014/15 which we are on target to do.

'Last year alone we increased the yield from our compliance work to £13.9bn.'
