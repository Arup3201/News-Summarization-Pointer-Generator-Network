A British man spent a fortnight in prison in South Africa after police mistook bath salts in his apartment for the illegal drug crystal meth, his lawyer said today.

Peter Parnell, 34, from London, was arrested and held in a crowded Cape Town jail before lab tests revealed the granules were just harmless toiletries.

Today his lawyer David Mbzwana said the case, which was dropped earlier this month, had 'disturbed him deeply'.

He said: 'Peter has had a very tough time. The whole thing was a complete mess.

'He was held in conditions that are not fit for humans - a prison room that is meant to hold 20 men may be filled with 60.

'Peter's head was in a mess when he came out - it disturbed him deeply. It is just such a relief that no charges were brought. It was ridiculous.'

Mr Parnell had been in South Africa nearly three months when officers arrived with a warrant to search his apartment in the Cape Town suburb of Table View on February 29.

Mr Mbzwana added: 'The police found 9.5 kilos of the substance, which had an estimated value of ZAR10 million (around £900,000).

'When Peter told them it was bath salts, they arrested him anyway.

A fortnight inside: Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, where Peter Parnell was held

'I'm not aware of why he had such a big pile of bath salts in his place.

'He had arrived in December in South Africa. His fiancée lives here.

'He now is due to leave for Britain as soon as possible, and hopes to put the whole thing behind him.'

'Mr Parnell was held at notorious Pollsmoor prison, where former South African president Nelson Mandela spent part of his 27-year jail term.

Earlier this month a hearing at Cape Town magistrates' court saw charges withdrawn, but he was rearrested because his three-month visa had expired while he was in custody.

Mr Mbzwana said: 'Immigration officials said Peter had broken the law because he was meant to leave by March 8, but at that time he was behind bars. This was not his fault.'

Mr Parnell was given his passport back last week, leaving him free to return to Britain.

Possession of the party drug crystal methamphetamine, known locally as 'tik', carries a jail sentence of at least ten years in South Africa.

The highly addictive substance has become a widespread problem in the sprawling townships of the Western Cape.

It is a stimulant which often provokes violence, and is a factor in South Africa's high gun and knife crime rate.

The arrest is understood to have been part of a drugs crackdown operation by the country's elite Hawks police wing.

The South African Police Service and Hawks branch declined to comment.
