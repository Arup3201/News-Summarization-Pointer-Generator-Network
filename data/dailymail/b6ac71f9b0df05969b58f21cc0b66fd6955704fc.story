When Charlie Mulgrew left Celtic first time around, he did so not so much as under a cloud as under angry, darkened skies.

A public spat with former manager Gordon Strachan stamped the player’s ticket to England – initially with Wolves – and there seemed no doubt back then that it was of the one-way variety.

If the chances of the player returning to the home of his boyhood heroes looked slim as he embarked on a tour of duty including outposts like Southend, then the prospect of him skippering the Parkhead side one day looked next to nil.

Turnaround: Charlie Mulgrew is set for the armband against KR Reykjavik

Little wonder then that upon being handed the armband in Iceland by Ronny Deila last week in the absence of the injured Scott Brown,  the 28-year-old midfielder took a moment to take stock.

Whilst Mulgrew had occasionally enjoyed the honour under previous manager Neil Lennon, never before had he led the team out for a European tie.

‘Being captain is huge,’ Mulgrew said. ‘Growing up a Celtic fan, to captain the side – be it in a friendly or a reserve match, never mind a Champions League qualifier, is a proud moment. It’s a huge honour and I’m delighted.

‘When I left Celtic the first time, I never thought something like this would happen. When you leave, coming back is the last thing on your mind – never mind captaining the club.

‘What was the secret? Keep believing in yourself and hard work is the main thing. But it’s a proud moment to stand in for Broony and I’m delighted.’ Now a seasoned Champions League and international player, Mulgrew might well have been forgiven for glossing over the honour bestowed on him in Reykjavik.

A lifetime of following the club taught him better, though, while the esteemed company he joined served to remind him of his responsibilities.

‘Paul McStay was a great captain when I was growing up. Neil Lennon, too, and Henrik Larsson captained the side.

‘There are guys like Jackie McNamara - and Billy McNeill won the European Cup as captain.

‘I grew up as a Celtic fan and watched some of these guys captain the club. It’ s a dream come true to do it.

‘It is an important role. You just have to lead by example. Scott has done that for three years and I will try to carry that on.

‘It’s a great confidence boost to be handed the armband after he got injured. He’s a great captain and it’s good that the manager has come in and seen me as a captain, too.

‘There is an added responsibility but you just try to do things the way you normally do.

‘The responsibility is in the back of your mind, but you just need to keep doing your normal things.’

Captain's role: Facing the press ahead of the key Champions League game

Very much his own man, Mulgrew believes there would be no sense in him attempting to merely parrot the approach of Brown in the lead-up to tonight’s second leg.

‘We are two different characters,’ he insisted. ‘We are good friends off the pitch and hopefully some of what he does rubs off on me.

‘Do I see myself as a leader? I suppose I’d like to think I lead by example in some ways. But that’s for other people to say. If I’m captain, I’ll just look to lead by example.

‘I’ll speak to younger players but I do that anyway. I try to help the young guys naturally.’

For all Celtic lead by a goal going into tonight’s match, the job isn’t yet done. Given the high-stakes game they hope to be a part of, Deila’s side can assume nothing.

‘We just look after ourselves and hopefully that will be enough,’ Mulgrew added. ‘It won’t be easy. It never is when a team camps in to defend.

‘But we created chances in Iceland and hopefully we can do the same again and take them this time.

‘Maybe it should have been more convincing over there but it’s early in the season and that bit of sharpness will come. There are just small things that we need to work on.’
