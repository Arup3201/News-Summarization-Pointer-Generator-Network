Americans drink more in the winter, a study has revealed.

From December to March, most enjoy a generous tipple at least five days a week.

Typically the season starts on the first Friday of advent.

It ends with a heavy two-day marathon on St Patricks Day weekend.

Revealed: Americans drink more between December and March according to a new breathalyzer app

The results emerged in a study by BACtrack breathlyzer - an app that lets people monitor their blood alcohol content levels.

Analyzing the anonymous data from all its users, the firm compiled a graph showing when most people had a blood alcohol content level of more than 0.06 per cent - the scientific definition of slurring-your-words drunk. 

Let the drinks flow at Christmas: More than five days a week are spent drinking in winter, the study showed

This year, Valentine's Day fell on a Wednesday - but that didn't hold back the hordes of people treating themselves to a hump day beverage.

Other days of intense drinking in the past 12 months fell on December 6 and 7 - with an average BAC of 0.088 per cent - and New Year's Eve, with a 0.094 per cent BAC average.

January 18 and 19, January 25, and March 7 and 8 when the other days that saw the heaviest drinking.

The rest of the year, Americans rarely drank as much, and never as often - only pouring a tipple a maximum of three days a week.
