Brendan Rodgers has branded criticism of Raheem Sterling as 'incredible' as he prepares to unleash the England international on Arsenal.

During an unusually brief and tense press conference at Liverpool's Melwood training ground, Rodgers was economical with his words but his longest answer was saved for when the subject of Sterling arose.

The 20-year-old scored twice in Wednesday night's 3-1 win over Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup quarter-final and is almost certain to lead the line against Arsenal on Sunday, given that Mario Balotelli is suspended.

Sterling enjoyed one of his finest games in a Liverpool shirt when Arsenal were demolished 5-1 in February and Rodgers did not waste his chance to highlight what he feels is unjust criticism of the young forward.

‘Raheem is an outstanding talent,” Rodgers said. “It is incredible the stick that the kid has received. He has been outstanding for us, wherever he has played. (On Sunday) we will do what is in the best interests of the team.’

When asked about Mario Balotelli’s one-game ban from The FA, Rodgers said: ‘We accept the ban so it is fairly clear. He is here as a footballer player and is trying to become a better player.’

During his four minutes and 33 seconds in front of the cameras, Rodgers would not give any indication whether he would be looking to make new signings in January or give any indications whether Fabio Borini, who is admired by Sunderland manager Gus Poyet, has long-term future at Anfield.

He did, however, speak briefly on Liverpool missing out to Arsenal in the race to sign Alex Sanchez last summer.

‘He is a world-class player,’ Rodgers said. 

‘He was identified as somebody who could come here and be perfect for us. He is a brilliant footballer with outstanding quality and a great work-rate. Arsenal are a top side with top players, but the focus will be on ourselves.’
