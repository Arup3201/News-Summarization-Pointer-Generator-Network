A mother and her boyfriend have been indicted in the murder of her five-year-old daughter who was beaten to death just weeks after child services dropped its investigation into the family.

Amanda Hendrickson, 33, and Roderick Buckner, 35, were indicted in Monroe County, Georgia on Tuesday for murder and aggravated battery in the death of Heaven Woods, WSBTV reported. 

Heaven was found unresponsive at Buckner's Forsyth home on May 20 and was pronounced dead in hospital. An autopsy showed that she had died of blunt force trauma to the abdomen.

It also revealed evidence of other injuries, some old and some new - and after her death, it emerged that a teacher and family members had allegedly witnessed her being mistreated by her mother.

Charged: Amanda Hendrickson and her boyfriend Roderick Buckner have been indicted for murder in the death of her five-year-old daughter, who died last year after blunt force trauma to her abdomen

Victim: Heaven Woods, pictured, was found unresponsive at Buckner's home last May and later died

Just three weeks before she died, one of Heaven's teachers reported seeing Hendrickson kicking the little girl hard in the back and contacted the Division of Family and Children Services.

The agency launched an investigation but Hendrickson, Heaven and a family friend denied the little girl had been kicked and said she had bruises from falling. The teacher was never interviewed.

The DFCS dropped the investigation - even though it was the ninth complaint they had had about the family since 2009, according to the case summary obtained by The Atlanta Journal Constitution.

On one occasion, Hendrickson told the girl's grandmother that she had a bump on her head because she had fallen into a coffee table.

When Heaven had bruises in the shape of a handprint on her neck, the mother claimed it was because the girl was autistic and would sometimes hurt herself.

The property manager of their home in Rome also reported seeing the mother drag the girl around on a harness 'like a dog'. 

'History of abuse': Heaven (left) was found to have new and old injuries on her body when she died, and it emerged that child services had been called nine times about her mother, who gave birth while in jail last year

Heartbroken: Hendrickson's mother Lisa Coursey said last year that both should face the death penalty if the accusations against them were true. She said she saw signs of abuse but bought her daughter's excuses

Relatives also reported seeing Hendrickson lift the girl off the ground by her hair and said Heaven had a black eye around Christmas.

'How do you get bruises to go away?' Hendrickson wrote on Facebook on the morning of Heaven's death.

Ashley Coursey, Hendrickson's half-sister, told The AJC last year: 'I wish I would have stepped up and done something.'

After the girl's death, her maternal grandmother, Lisa Coursey, added to WSBTV: 'I want the death penalty on both of them. If she did that to my granddaughter, she needs to rot.' 

It also emerged that Heaven's father Antony Woods had petitioned for primary custody of Heaven in 2012, adding that her visits with her mother should be limited because of violence towards the child.

But Hendrickson responded that Woods was the violent one. 

Scene: The girl was unresponsive when emergency responders arrived at this home in Forsyth, Georgia

He continued his fight to see his daughter and petitioned the court in October 2013 and January 2014. 

The caseworker and their supervisor were removed from duties interacting with families while an investigation into their conduct was carried out. 

Hendrickson was taken into custody last year and, while in jail, she gave birth to another daughter, who has now been placed into state custody.

She was initially charged with felony child cruelty but extra charges were expected to be brought. 

They will be arraigned on April 16, according to WSBTV.
