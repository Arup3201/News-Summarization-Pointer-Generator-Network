A radiator sales director called Phil Neville was told to die and get cancer as he received a torrent of abuse on Twitter intended for his namesake following his commentary during England's World Cup opener with Italy.

Former football referee Mr Neville, 60, said he received at least 1,000 tweets as Twitter users got him mixed up with the ex-Manchester United and Everton footballer.

BBC commentator Neville has been criticised for his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during the game on Saturday.

Mr Neville, of Hadleigh, Suffolk, has now offered to do a job swap with his football commentator namesake after he got caught up in the crossfire.

Twitter users confused his Twitter handle, @philneville, with that of the ex-footballer, @fizzer18.

Mr Neville said: 'I haven’t gone to the police because it’s not for me, but there are some very sad people out there.'

He went on to say: 'Some tweets said "I hope you die" and "I hope you get cancer".'

Mr Neville said he went out to watch the match with friends and left his phone at home.

His mobile phone had been going off all night with alerts but Mr Neville went to bed and ignored them until the next morning.

Ex-footballer Phil Neville has welcomed the feedback on his first live commentary and insisted the criticism 'will only make me better'

'I reckon I’ve had about 1,000 tweets,' he said.

'This weekend has been unbelievable, just unreal. There were a lot of Fs and Cs, particularly from Liverpool fans, but for me it’s been more fun than abusive.

'I just don’t take any notice.

'A few have said sorry when they have realised and have seen the funny side too.

'I have been able to laugh at it, it has been amusing and it just keeps getting funnier.

'Apparently he has said he will try to do better so I am sure my phone will come alive again.'

Mr Neville, who played football before becoming a referee, has joked that he is available for commentary work.

Since then he has been offered a possible opportunity to commentate on England's game against Uruguay on Thursday.

'I don't know what will come of it but I know a bit about football so who knows, maybe I could do a decent job,' he said.

Mr Neville, who was the fourth official at a few Premier League matches in the 1990s, said he enjoyed watching the football match on Saturday.

He said: 'I must admit that when listening in the first-half I didn’t realise it was Phil Neville, but he was terrible.

'It was only when they went back to the commentary team for the second-half and they said it was him that I realised - and I couldn’t believe it.'

The ex-footballer Neville has welcomed the feedback on his first live commentary and insisted the criticism 'will only make me better'.

He admitted the job is harder than he thought after hundreds of viewers complained about his on-air performance.

A BBC spokeswoman said there were 445 complaints after Saturday night’s game, which pulled in a peak audience of 15.6 million viewers.

Neville, 37, told Radio 5 Live yesterday: 'I think the biggest thing I learned is that co-commentary is harder than what I thought it was going to be.

'I welcome all the feedback you get and it's a welcome to the social media so you come in after a game you're hyped up, its just like playing doing a co-commentary, you're focused for 90 minutes, you turn your phone on and you’re getting some lovely messages.

'But I’m really looking forward to the game on Thursday, I’m back in the co-commentary booth and I will get better. It was my first live gig and I'm just glad I helped everybody sleep back home.'

Neville, who said he 'really loved' working as a commentator, said: 'The feedback is [that] the content I put out was quite good, obviously the feedback is I need to show a little more excitement so I think you’ll see that on Thursday night.'
