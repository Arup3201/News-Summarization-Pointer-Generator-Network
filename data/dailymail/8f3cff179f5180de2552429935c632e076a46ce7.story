After more than a month spent living without teeth, 16-year-old cancer survivor Alex Hunter finally has something to smile about.

The Delano, California, teen had all his teeth removed in early July due to chemotherapy side effects.

When the family's medical insurance refused to foot the bill to fit Alex with dentures, the Hunters took to the Internet, launching a fundraiser to collect the $11,000 needed to pay for the dental procedure.

Say 'cheese'! Alex Hunter, 16, a cancer survivor from California, is showing off his new dentures, which his family were able to pay for thanks to a fundraising campaign

This morning, the boy's wish for a new set of teeth finally became a reality.

Speaking
 exclusively to MailOnline Friday evening, Alex's mother, Lizbeth 
Hunter, revealed that her son was overjoyed to have his new dentures.

‘He
 was a little more excited than he thought he would be,’ Ms Hunter told 
MailOnline in a phone interview. ‘It was an emotional moment for all of 
us, but definitely a good one.’

Alex’s
 mother said the procedure took more than an hour since the teen, who 
has beat two rare cancers, suffers from some issues with his jaw bone.

When all the dental work was complete, Alex was thrilled at the results and proclaimed his dentures 'perfect.'

‘He just smiled really big. He just had nothing but joy,’ his mother said.

It
 will take a few more days for Alex to adjust to the new teeth before he
 is able to talk and eat normally, but Lizbeth Hunter said her brave son
 is taking everything in stride.

 revealed that for his first meal after the long-awaited dental 
appointment the teen chose Wendy’s, but because he is not entirely 
comfortable yet wearing the dentures, he was forced to take them out to 
eat.

Lizbeth Hunter also said that the dentist who performed the procedure and his staff were very pleased with the results and marvelled at how naturally Alex’s dentures looked on him.

‘To me they don’t look natural because I’m not used to seeing him with teeth,’ Lizbeth said with a laugh. 

As for Alex, Mrs Hunter said, ‘He loves them.’

On the eve of the dental procedure, Alex told his friends at school that he was planning to go to Los Angeles to be fitted with a set of dentures – news that came as a shock to them.

‘They didn’t realize he had no teeth!’ Mrs Hunter told MailOnline.

In an interview with MailOnline last month, Lizbeth Hunter said Alex was 'blown away' by the reaction from around the world as cash for his dentures poured in from those touched by his story published by MailOnline.

In less than a day, the family raised the $11,000 for the procedure - and then some!

Declined treatment by his insurance company, Alex took to his gofundme page to express his heartfelt gratitude, 'from friends, to family, to my community and everyone else that has been beyond generous to help me in meeting and surpassing my goal. Thank you!'

In
 less than 48 hours, Alex has seen donations of more than $17,000 flood 
into his gofundme page to help him and his initial goal of $11,000 was reached in less than 
20 hours.

Addressing the Good Samartinas’ largesse, Ms Hunter said her son was surprised and ‘very very grateful.’

‘He had no idea so many people would actually care,’ she said Friday after the dental appointment.

One anonymous donor pledged $5,000 and Lizbeth said that she was extremely touched by the gesture.

'I am praying God blesses you as much as you have blessed Alex,' said Lizbeth to MailOnline in July.

The remaining money left over from the fundraising campaign will remain in an account to help Alex with any more medical expenses he will need.

Lizbeth Hunter said her son still suffers from side effects related to one of his ailments. Later this year, the high school junior will undergo a scan to make sure his thyroid cancer has not made a comeback.

Alex, from Delano, California, made the tough decision to get his 19 remaining teeth in July after years of radiation left the roots fragile and the teeth too loose to use.

While his insurance - which is provided by the state because of his mother's job working for Bakersfield - covered part of the procedure to remove the teeth, it refused to cover the dentures, his family said - prompting their internet fundraising.

'They say it's not a medical issue but they know they took out the teeth because of a medical issue,' his grandmother, Roberta Hunter, told MailOnline earlier this summer about the insurance company's stance.

'It feels like the insurance is just bailing out on him.'

Now the teenager, who loves to sing and one day hopes to be a high school counselor, will be able to eat and speak normally - and finally smile.

'Even when he smiled, he didn’t show any teeth,' his mother recalled.  

On the mend: Alex was first diganosed with cancer when he was four and overcame it, before being diagnosed again when he was 13. His family is now hopeful that he is cancer-free for the second time

Alex's family, who have never asked for anything throughout Alex's 11 years of treatments launched their gofundme page, Alex Hunter's Medical Fund, last month in the hope of raising the money.

Alex was just four when he was first diagnosed with a rare type of cancer, Embryonal Parameningeal Rhabdomyosarcoma, after a mass started growing in his cheek.

He underwent aggressive chemotherapy and stayed in hospital for months as he battled the side effects of the radiation. He lost vision in his left eye and feeling on the left side of his face.

He was also left with a thin frame, loose teeth and thyroid gland issues, but in July 2003, doctors said he was cancer-free.

Then in November 2011, when he was 13, he was back to hospital to undergo surgery on an enlarged thyroid gland - and doctors learned he had Hurthle Cell Carcinoma, a rare thyroid cancer.

On the gofundme page, his family explained that the cancer is believed to be an effect of treatment from his first battle with cancer.

But now, nearly three years on from his second diagnosis, and his family said he is free from cancer again. One final scan in October will confirm that he's been cured.

In the meantime, Alex is impressing his family with his commitment as a student and a friend.

Relatives told KERO that he once put together a yearbook for a friend, including photos and signatures from staff and students, after the teen could not afford to buy one from the school.

Alex is also taking advanced placement classes and has been singing with the choir for two years. He is already thinking about college, where he wants to major in psychology and sociology.

'He's just so positive,' his grandmother said. 'He sings, he's really active in school - but kids do stare at him. I can't wait for him to get his teeth but right now all we can do is take it one day at a time.'
