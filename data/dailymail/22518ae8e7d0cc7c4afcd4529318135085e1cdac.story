Liverpool will be without England midfielder Adam Lallana for the next month due to a thigh injury.

The 26-year-old had been beginning to produce the kind of performances which led the Reds to pay Southampton a reported £25million for his services in the summer.

Lallana scored a brace as Swansea were seen off 4-1 last Monday and started a sixth successive match in all competitions in the New Year's Day encounter with Leicester at Anfield.

However, the attacking midfielder was forced off after 55 minutes with what manager Brendan Rodgers called 'a tweak in his thigh'.

It is a complaint that will rule the England international out for four weeks.

The injury saw Lallana miss Monday's FA Cup third-round clash at AFC Wimbledon, which Liverpool won 2-1, and will see him miss both legs of the Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea, as well as several Barclays Premier League matches.
