Changing your own appearance in post-production, be it via Photoshop or an array of filters, is becoming more commonplace.

But users will soon be able to edit what they look like in real time, thanks to a new app set to be released for iOS and Android later this year.

Called Looksery, it uses tracking technology to change the user's face live on the screen, whether it’s during a video call, or when taking a picture.

Looksery is a new app set for release later this year on iOS (August) and Android (November) that enables you to change your appearance on the go. Using some high-tech facial tracking technology, the app can alter your appearance, from changing the colour of your eyes to turning you into a zombie

The team behind the app are currently seeking funding on Kickstarter to ensure it arrives on iOS in August and Android by November.

'We have developed our own code for video face tracking, and designed unique video filters which work in real-time,' the team wrote on Kickstarter.

'The Looksery app is programmed using C++, GLSL and ASM and we use some of the features of the OpenCV library.

'Our tracking and initialization algorithms are based on the Active Appearance Model.

'Currently we have five patents pending, involving real-time face-tracking and the technology that modifies it.

'The app has a user friendly interface and you can change your appearance with just a singe tap.'

Aside from the aforementioned features, the app has a ‘simple interface’ and social media sharing options.

It is even able to track and alter a face when there are multiple people in the shot.

To use the app, a user opens the app and points the camera at themselves.

The face tracking software then builds a mapped ‘model’ of that person’s appearance.

Along the bottom of the app there are 16 filters that can be applied to change the look of someone.

These range from ‘zombifying’ a person, to making them appear thinner.

Within the app the user can take an edited picture of themselves and send it to others.

They can also take a video or make a live video call, altering their appearance on-the-go.

Additionally, there is a chat feature included, which lets people send images and videos to each other alongside text.

‘The technology that drives Looksery was built from scratch by our team,’ the company wrote.

‘We are the first company to bring the full power of such complex face-tracking technology to mobile.

‘This
 means you can now do so much more than just adding a few generic 
pictures or animations to your media; it is the ability to completely 
modify your appearance and exchange video messages as 3D characters.

‘With Looksery you can explore different filters that change entirely the way you look and enhance videos.’

There are 16 filters available that can be used to alter your face. There are several ways the app can be used, including taking a picture and sharing it with friends or making a live video call and changing your face as you talking. The app can also pick out one face from a crowd of many

Making yourself look like a zombie is perhaps one of the scarier features of the app, and the effect is seemingly quite real. Some of the other effects include making your face appear as an x-ray, turning yourself into a 3D animated bear, changing your neck shape and more
