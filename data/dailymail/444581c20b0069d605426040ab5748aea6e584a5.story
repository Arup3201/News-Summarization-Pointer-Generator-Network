Stoke City have intensified their row with Garry Monk by complaining to the FA about the Swansea manager's 'cheat' against Victor Moses.

The FA are already investigating Monk's criticism of referee Michael Oliver, who awarded Moses a soft penalty in Stoke's 2-1 win on Saturday.

Monk branded the decision 'disgraceful' and 'disgusting', while he also said Moses should be 'ashamed of himself' – comments that enraged Stoke chairman Peter Coates, who has also reported pundit John Hartson to the BBC over his claim on Match of the Day 2 that Moses dived.

Coates has since contacted the FA about Monk's remarks. He said: 'We've been in touch with the FA to ask what is happening with Garry Monk because of what he said.

'It's up to the particular authorities concerned about what they do now because it's not in our jurisdiction and not up to us to offer advice.

'But we are unhappy when they come out and accuse one of our players of cheating.

'We don't believe that is justified in any shape or form. The player was caught, and then he went down.'

Sportsmail understands that Coates' complaint will have little to no impact on the ongoing FA investigation, which is centred on Monk's comments about Oliver rather than those said against Moses. Monk is expected to receive a formal charge or warning for the comments made about Oliver.

Monk is this week likely to be contacted by referees chief Mike Riley, who was also criticised by the Swansea manager at the weekend. Monk hit out at Riley for his 'very poor' failure to respond to his numerous complaints about the officiating of Swansea matches this season.

Monk's grievances include his trenchant feeling that Swansea have been on the wrong end of several significant decisions this season.

Monk, who has repeatedly aired his complaints in the past month and passed on his views to Chris Foy on the official's recent training visit to Swansea, has been angered that Riley has never contacted him to discuss his concerns.

The rookie manager went to the length last Friday of bypassing Riley altogether by posting a letter and DVD to his superior, John Williams, the chairman of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, detailing the incidents that have riled him.

A Premier League spokesman said on Monday: 'The correspondence from Swansea was received by PGMOL on Monday morning and Mike will no doubt be speaking to Gary this week.'

Monk had said about Riley: 'I have sent a DVD off with a letter, expressing my disappointment and I've had no contact from Mike Riley.

'I think it is about being pro-active and he is clearly not doing that - he is clearly not listening to anything I am saying. (Riley's) job is to ring me - it's not mine to ring him. He is supposed to be the head of these guys and overseeing it all, and seeing what managers feel.

'But I've had no contact whatsoever, and for me, that is very poor.'
