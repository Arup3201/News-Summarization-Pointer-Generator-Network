A white Detroit man who killed a young, unarmed black woman on his porch heard her 'boom, boom, boom' at least four separate times before he opened the door and shot her in the face.

The pounding caused Theodore Wafer to fear for his life, his defense lawyer argued today, and made his use of force justifiable under Michigan self-defense law.

Jurors heard opening statements Wednesday in the trial of Wafer, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 19-year-old Renisha McBride last November in Dearborn Heights.

The 55-year-old Wafer claims he acted in self-defense, but prosecutors say his actions were unreasonable. The shooting occurred around 4.30am, 3-and-a-half hours after McBride crashed her car about a half-mile away. An autopsy found she was drunk and had marijuana in her system.

McBride's pounding on the door at such
 an early hour led Wafer to think his life was in danger, defense 
attorney Cheryl Carpenter told jurors.

'"People
 were trying to get in." That was reasonable for Ted to believe and 
that's what he believed that night," Carpenter said, according to the 
Detroit Free Press.

'Why? He doesn't have a clue.'

McBride
 had been smoking marijuana most of the day before she was killed. Her 
friend, Amber Jenkins said that McBride had been at her house partying 
that night. The pair played drinking games and smoked three blunts 
together.

Ms Jenkins estimated that McBride had half a fifth of New Amsterdam Vodka - which sells for about $12 to $14.

Prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark says Wafer could have called police instead of shooting McBride.

Defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter says Wafer feared for his life.

But Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark told jurors that despite the loud noises of McBride knocking on Wafer's door - she was no threat to him and never was.

'There was no prying (of the doors) or no kicking,' she said, according to the Detroit News.

The screen door, which Wafer fired through to shoot McBride, was still locked when police arrived.

The shooting has stoked racial tensions in Detroit. McBride's family and community activists have compared her death to that of Trayvon Martin - another unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed by a man who claimed self-defense.

The jury of 12 and two alternates is made up of seven men and seven women. Four jurors are black.
