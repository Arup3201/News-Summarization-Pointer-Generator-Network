Michael Sam, the first openly gay player signed to the NFL, is without a team after being waived by the Dallas Cowboys.

The 24-year-old defensive end was signed by the Cowboys on September 3 following his release by the St Louis Rams, who had drafted him in the seventh round earlier this year.

But Sam, who spent all his time in the practice squad with the Cowboys and did not make the 53-man squad, once again finds himself without a team and will become a free agent if he is not claimed off waivers by another club.

Sam tweeted: 'I want to thank the Jones family and the entire Cowboys organization for this opportunity, as well as my friends, family, teammates, and fans for their support. While this is disappointing, I will take the lessons I learned here in Dallas and continue to fight for an opportunity to prove that I can play every Sunday.' 

'The Cowboys have decided to waive defensive end Michael Sam,' read a statement on the Cowboys' official website.

'The practice squad player who joined the team on September 3 spent the first seven weeks of the season on the 10-man squad and never made it to the 53-man roster.'
