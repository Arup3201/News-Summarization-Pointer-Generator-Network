London Fashion Week is one of the world's most exclusive style events.

Front rows are teaming with clusters of A-list celebrities and fashion powerhouses such as Anna Wintour and Alexa Chung and no invite means no entry.

We might not be able to offer you seat next to Alexa but you can catch one of the catwalk's first big shows from the front row with our exclusive Fearne Cotton's SS15 catwalk show video below.
