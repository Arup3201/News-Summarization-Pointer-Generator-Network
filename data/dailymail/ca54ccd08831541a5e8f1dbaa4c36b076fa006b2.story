Mark Zuckerberg has revealed that if he were to tell his 19-year-old self anything as he was starting to launch Facebook, it wouldn’t be anything related to business.

‘I don’t know, maybe marry Priscilla sooner,’ he said.

The 29-year-old billionaire married his college sweetheart in May 2012 at a surprise ceremony in their Palo Alto home after dating for years, but apparently he feels he waited too long.

Big day: Tuesday marks the 10th anniversary of the creation of Facebook and founder Mark Zuckerberg says that the company is still planning to grow

Looking back: When faced with an interview that he did at age 19 (right), he said that the advice he would have told his former self would be to marry his wife Priscilla sooner

In spite of the emotional moment during his interview with The Today Show’s Savannah Guthrie, he clammed up when she asked about the prospect of the couple adding kids to their brood anytime soon.

‘Ooh, Savannah, have you been talking to my mom?’ he joked.

Instead, he admitted that couple have been focusing on their less complicated interests, saying he recently splurged on a nice grill because they like to cook and he constantly adds pictures of their pet dog, Beast.

‘He actually has more than a million fans,’ Zuckerberg said of Beast’s invidividual Facebook page.

‘He's like this ridiculously cute dog. He looks like a little sheep, he's a sheep-herding dog and he's just this little 30 pound dog and he's just amazing.’

Happy day: After meeting as students at Harvard, Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg got married at their Palo Alto home in May 2012

Having fun: Zuckerberg said that he takes tons of pictures of the dog that he and Priscilla (pictured) share, and have even created a Facebook page for the Hungarian sheep-herding dog named Beast

The mogul talked about how Facebook is continuing to grow even after reaching the 10-year milestone birthday today.

‘When I think back on this I just think, “You know, I'm one of the luckiest people in the world,”’ he said.

‘If I'd only had a fraction of the experiences I've had, and only met a few of the people I've had the opportunity to work with, I would still be one of the luckiest people in the world. I mean, that's not lost on me.

'It's been a pretty amazing journey. It's so rare to touch a billion people's lives.’

Zuckerberg, 29, was famously still in college at Harvard when he launched the company, and said that despite recent reports, teens are not fleeing the social network.

‘Facebook and Instagram are both really popular with teens, both in the U.S. and globally. I think what you're starting to see is that there are all these different ways that people want to share and communicate. I think increasingly, people aren't going to get them all from just one app,’ he said.

When asked about his company's phenomenal success, Zuckerberg put it down to the fact that he, and his employees, simply 'cared more'.

‘I've spent a lot of late nights pacing around my living room with teammates just trying to plot out what our next move can be in order to keep pushing forward on this mission, but there's always a next move,’ he told the Today Show host during an interview at Facebook’s California headquarters.

‘But one of the big things that I've taken away from the last 10 years is, there's always a next move and you just need to keep on pushing forward and keep on doing the best thing that you can.’

Last week, the company has had the largest single-day stock rise since July 2013, jumping from $53.47 to $61.03 per share.

Making a jump: The increase in company's stock last Wednesday from $53.47 to $61.03 per share was the highest single-day jump since July 2013

Future plans: One of the biggest projects that Zuckerberg is working on is called internet.org, which is trying to help connect more people to the internet across the globe

The company’s share price has remained high, and is currently at $62.38 per share on Tuesday morning.

Facebook's fourth-quarter revenue rose to $2.585billion from $1.585 billion in the year-ago period, beating analysts' average expectation of $2.33billion.

Facebook said on Wednesday that revenue from mobile ads represented 53 per cent of its total fourth-quarter advertising revenue, up from 49 per cent in the third quarter.
