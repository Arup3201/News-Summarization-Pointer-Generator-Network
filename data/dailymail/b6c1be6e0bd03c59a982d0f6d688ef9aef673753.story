A controversial new BBC reality TV show is under investigation by police over the shocking driving offences committed by teenage motorists on the programme.

Barely Legal Drivers, broadcast on BBC Three, uses dashboard cameras to film youngsters screaming swear words at other drivers and talking on mobile phones while behind the wheel.

Now more than 300 viewers have complained about the behaviour of the teenagers, and police are looking into whether any of the participants should be prosecuted for their sloppy driving.

Many have expressed outrage at the fact that some contestants are apparently rewarded by being given a free car by the BBC.

The show hit the headlines even before its premiere after one teenager revealed that she had been tricked into taking part by being told that the programme would be similar to The Only Way Is Essex.

In the first episode, broadcast last week and seen by 700,000 viewers, 19-year-old Chantelle Jefferies from Bristol was shown repeatedly yelling obscenities, talking on her mobile while driving and even eating a sandwich on the road.

She also applied lipstick while cruising on the motorway, and screamed in surprise when a bus pulled out in front of her at a junction.

However, at the end of the episode she was judged to have learned her lesson, and producers gave her father enough money to buy her a brand new car.

Outrage: Bradley shown taking a breathalyser test on the show which has attracted 300 complaints

Another boy on the programme took pride in doing 100mph on the motorway, and at one point producers had to stop him from driving after he was found to be almost twice the legal drink-drive limit.

One girl featured even said: 'I drive so much better when I'm a little bit tipsy.'

Each episode sees the contestants given either a car or advanced driving lessons after their driving habits are analysed by their parents and retired traffic policewoman Judith Roberts.

Avon and Somerset Constabulary, Miss Jefferies' local force, is looking into the behaviour depicted in the programme.

'We are investigating the driving offences being committed on the programme and are considering prosecution,' Superintendent Paul Richards said.

'At the very least, we condemn such irresponsible behaviour and would reassure everyone that we treat it extremely seriously.'

Lesson: Lauri, another contestant on the show which the BBC claims teaches the importance of good driving

So far, 286 people have complained to the BBC about the dangerous driving shown, and the apparent reward of bad behaviour by a free car.

In addition, 45 people had complained to regulator Ofcom by the time the second episode was broadcast on Tuesday.

Road safety charity Barke warned that Barely Legal Drivers must ensure that 'depictions of risky driving aren't glamourised'.

The BBC insists that the programme rewards those who learn from their mistakes and improve their driving, adding that the car given out as a reward is 'sensible' and has a small engine.

'Barely Legal Drivers highlights the issue that young drivers in the UK are some of the most dangerous in Europe,' a spokesman said. 'It's about making young people better drivers.'

Before the show aired one contestant, Amy Smith, complained that she had been tricked into appearing after producers told her it would be a glossy lifestyle programme like Towie or Made in Chelsea.
