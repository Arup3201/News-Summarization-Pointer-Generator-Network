From pelicans outside a seafood shop to a crocodile roaming through a school hall - these are the unique moments of life from across Australia.

The spectacular photos were shared on Instagram as part of a joint Tourism Australia and Art & About Sydney competition calling on people to share their favourite moments using the hashtag #AustralianLife.

One winner and five finalists have now been announced after the judging panel trawled through 30,000 Instagram entries.

The finalists shared moments from all over Australia, including a riverside lunch on the Hastings River, an unexpected classroom visitor and a kangaroo filled foggy sunrise.

The winning photograph captured the moment a group of pelicans gathered outside a seafood shop at Port Macquarie in northern NSW in the hope of getting a free feed.
