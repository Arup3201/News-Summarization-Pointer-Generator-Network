Bad teacher: 38-year-old surf instructor Dylan Greiner was arrested Friday night on suspicion of child molestation

A surf school instructor in Santa Cruz, California was arrested late Friday night on suspicion of 'lewd and lascivious acts' with children.

Dylan Greiner, 38, is the owner of the Santa Cruz Surf School, and police say that he has been engaging in inappropriate relationships with children for at least the past four years.

Many remember Greiner as a local hero who posted a video drawing attention to the problem of needles on a local beach. But that was changed when two teenage girls, 13 and 14, alerted police that the instructor lured them into relationships by offering free surf lessons.

He then proceeded to make sexual advances on the children and videotaped their private body parts.

And police believe there may be more victims.

An
initial search of Greiner's home and business turned up 'thousands' of 
images of young girls, focusing on the 'breasts, buttocks and genitalia 
of young girls,' according to Santa Cruz police spokesman Steve Clark.

There was even video footage taken of students changing in and out of their wetsuits in the school's dressing rooms. The photographs and footage captured girls as young as 8-years-old.

Greiner
admitted to taking the secret changing room video and photographs and 
to downloading inappropriate images of teenage girls. He also admitted 
to viewing other child pornography.

His roommates and a 14-year-old girl were present at his house when Greiner was arrested.

After
his arrest, Greiner wrote letters to the two victims who came forward 
to police and to the community, apologizing for his actions. The letter to the community has not been made public.

Greiner
was somewhat of a local legend after a video he posted online of 
needles he found on a local beach spurred a clean-up effort.

Wipe-out: Greiner's Facebook was still public as of Sunday morning, with several shots of him surfing. A few images on his profile show him teaching young kids how to surf

I'm sorry: After his arrest, Greiner wrote letters to two to of the teenage girls he had a relationship with and the community, apologizing for his behavior

'Unfortunately, his video skills didn't stop there,' Clark told the San Jose Mercury News.

T.J. Magadallanes, who helped Greiner raise awareness about the needle problem was surprised to learn about the surfer's arrest.

'It's sickening. I can't believe it,' he said. 'It was quite a shocker considering he was a local hometown hero.'

As of Sunday morning, his Facebook account was still public and friends were taking to his wall to condemn Greiner.

'F*****'
pedophile...Can't wait for them to let you loose in gen pop. I give a 
pretty boy like you 5 minutes,' Bobby Hall wrote.

Greiner
was arrested and taken to the Santa Cruz County Jail where he is being 
held on $500,000 bond. A judge agreed to raise the bail amount 
considering more victims may come forward.
