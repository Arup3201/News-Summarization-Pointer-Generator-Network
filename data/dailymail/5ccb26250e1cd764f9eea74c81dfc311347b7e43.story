A father who launched a transatlantic custody battle against his estranged wife over their daughter has accused his former partner of drunkenness and domestic violence.

U.S. Army Sgt Jeffrey Lee Chafin is reportedly 'deeply concerned' about Lynn Hales' abilities as a mother.

The bitter custody dispute is over the couple's five-year-old daughter Eris.

When the couple split up in 2010, Ms Hales, a Scottish native, sued for custody and took the girl back to Scotland from Alabama.

The Supreme Court is now considering whether an American court can have any further say in the international custody dispute.

A decision is expected to be made in the next few months.

Sgt Chafin this week questioned Ms Hales fitness as a parent.

He said she was arrested on 
Christmas Eve 2010 for threatening him with a knife as their marriage broke down, according to the Daily Telegraph. Ms Hales denies 
these claims.

She was also arrested earlier in December 2010 for being drunk in public and reportedly fighting with a taxi driver in the U.S. but was never charged.

Sgt Chafin's lawyer Michael E. Manely told MailOnline today that he expected a swift decision on the case and believed that the Supreme Court would find in favor of his client.

Mr Manely said his client, who remains on active service with the U.S. Army, wants his daughter to be returned to America.

Mr Manely described the Chafins, who have a divorce case pending in Alabama, as having a 'love-hate' relationship. However he added that they seemed intent on working out custody arrangements for their daughter.

Custody fight: The Supreme Court is trying to determine whether Sgt Jeffrey Lee Chafin, can appeal a federal judge's decision to let his estranged wife take their daughter Eris back to her native Scotland

Sgt Chafin and Ms Hales, of Muirhead,
Lanarkshire, got married in Germany in 2006 and their daughter was born
there the following year.

The
family resided in Germany before Sgt Chafin, 42, was deployed to 
Afghanistan. Mother and daughter returned to her family in Scotland.

In
2009, Sgt Chafin was posted to Redstone Arsenal, Alabama and was joined
by 35-year-old Mrs Chafin and Eris where they began to build a life 
together. However over the next year, the relationship broke down.

Hales was deported back to Scotland in 2011 for overstaying her tourist visa.

She
sued to take their five-year-old daughter Eris with her, citing the 1980 Hague convention on 
international child abductions.

The
convention is designed to return children 
illegally taken from member countries. She said their daughter's 
residence was Scotland and that her husband illegally retained the child
in the United States. 

A
federal judge agreed and allowed the girl be taken to Scotland. The 
judge also refused to allow an appeal.

Sgt
Chafin then took the case to the circuit court, which said the case could not be considered because the child's official residence is in Scotland.

Now in the Supreme Court, judges are trying to 
determine whether Sgt Chafin can appeal a federal judge's decision to 
let Lynne Hales Chafin take Eris to Scotland. 

The
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Sgt Chafin's appeal was 
moot because the girl has now been in Scotland for more than a year, and
that his only remedy is in the Scottish courts.

Firing back: Hales has argued that their daughter's residence was Scotland

Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg told Sgt Chafin's lawyer
that the point of the Hague Convention was to stop the shuttling of 
children from country to country during custody disputes.

She
said: 'What you're urging is exactly what this Convention was meant to 
stop.

'This child has been in Scotland for 14 months. Now, you say bring 
it back to the United States, and we start over.

'The whole object of the return procedure is so that you get the child to a place that's a proper place to determine custody.'

But several judges seemed concerned by the idea that a foreign-born parent could escape U.S. court jurisdiction by leaving the country.

Chief Justice John Roberts said the situation would encourage such parents in custody disputes 'to leave immediately' following a favorable decision, even though it is not a final decision in U.S. courts.

Roberts said that was a parent flees 'it is all over', calling the situation a 'very unfortunate result'.

Lynne Chafin's lawyer Stephen Cullen said if a child has left America on an international flight the jurisdiction of the U.S. court system is over.

'There can be no re-return' order from the U.S. courts, Mr Cullen said, adding that Sgt Chafin can plead his case in Scottish courts.
