Robin Williams' daughter Zelda has denied claims made by her step-mom Susan Schneider that she and her siblings have taken items from home where he committed suicide in August.

On Monday, attorneys for Schneider, who married the late comedian in 2011, and his three children from previous marriages - Zachary, Zelda and Cody - headed to court in a battle over the late comedian's estate.

Schneider argued that she is entitled to keep the tuxedo he wore to their wedding, the wedding gifts he gave her and the photos from the couple's wedding.

Susan Schneider has agreed to settle a legal challenge against  her late husband Robin Williams' children that would have barred them from taking things out of his house in Tiburon, California. Susan is seen with Williams and his daughter Zelda (right) in 2011

Schneider had filed a motion seeking to bar her stepchildren from taking those items and anything else from the late actor's Tiburon, California, home.

She also claimed some of Williams' personal items were taken from his home without her permission.

The children responded by arguing that their step-mother - the actor's third wife - was 'adding insult to a terrible injury' by trying to change the trust and rob them of their farther's possessions. 

Zelda also posted a seperate statement on Monday in which she denied going to her father's home in Tiburon to take items.

'My brothers and I have not at any point since dad's death been invited to or visited his and Susan's house in Tiburon, nor have we removed anything from it,' she said in a statement posted on Instagram.

Following Monday's meeting between lawyers for the two sides, both parties have agreed to settle the matter out of court.

As per the actor's will, his three grown children - age 31, 25 and 23 - will get most of his jewelry, memorabilia and other belongings, including his awards. 

However, Susan Williams asked a judge to exclude the belongings in their 'marital home' in Tiburon from the list of belongings the children are allowed to take.

Both the children and the trustees of the estate took exception to the request.

'The Williams children are heartbroken that petitioner, Mr Williams' wife of less than three years, has acted against his wishes by challenging the plans he so carefully made for his estate,' the lawyer for Williams' children wrote. 

On Monday, following a scheduled court appearance in San Francisco, the two sides agreed to work out a solution out of court and return in June to report back to a judge.  

Most of Williams' $50million estate goes to his children. Susan, who married Williams in 2011, had a prenup agreement that gives her a slice of his fortune and the home outside San Francisco, where he killed himself on August 11.

Susan Williams' attorney said she was only seeking guidance from the court about the meaning of certain terms in the trust.

Schneider's lawyer said she was only hoping for a judge to clarify Williams' $50million will

Williams died at his home in Tiburon north of San Francisco in August. The coroner ruled his death a suicide that resulted from asphyxia caused by hanging.

Susan Williams has said the actor and comedian was struggling with depression, anxiety and a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

Williams' trust granted his children his memorabilia and awards in the entertainment industry among other particular personal items, according to court documents.

Susan Williams says that because he wanted her to continue to live at the Tiburon home, it makes sense that he intended only for his children to have the specific personal items he delineated that were kept at another home he owned in Napa.

The two sides also disagree over items put in storage, watches Williams owned and his memorabilia.
