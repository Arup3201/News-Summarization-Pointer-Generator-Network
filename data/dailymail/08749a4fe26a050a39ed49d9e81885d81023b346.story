When seven-year-old Kady Akester went trick or treating with her mother she hoped to get some sweets and at worst thought she may come across some scary Halloween costumes.

But when the child and her mother returned home to look at the treats she had gathered, they discovered an unwelcome surprise inside. 

In a sealed tub of Marks and Spencer Super Berry and Almonds mix lay an inch-long screw.

Toni Cole, mother to Kady, said she was shocked by the discovery and concerned about what could have happened had a toddler, or her younger son Zak, got hold of the tub.

The screw was spotted after Ms Cole handed the tub to her partner, Gareth Akester, 25, to show him their daughter's spoils.

It is the second problem to hit M&S in a week after a pianist spotted a dead earwig in his wholefood salad.  

Ms Cole, of Hull, East Yorkshire, said: 'I am disgusted - a child could have choked to death on that bolt.

'I had wanted to open the tub of nuts while we were out, but fortunately Kady said, "No mummy. We'll wait until we get home."

The one-inch long screw was spotted by the seven-year-old's father after she showed him her treats

Marks & Spencer said it was investigating how the screw got into the tub. The incident follows the retailer's apology last week after a dead ear wig was found in an M&S nutty super wholefood salad (right) by Lee Reed

'When we got home I handed the tub of nuts to Gareth but before he opened the tub he spotted a bolt, which was about an inch long.

'We put the tub away in a cupboard, because we didn't want to risk the children opening it.

'It's a good job Zak wasn't with us when we were out trick or treating.

Ms Cole said it was fortunate her daughter had decided not to open the tub until they got home 

'I'm sure he would have wanted to open the tub straightaway and I'd have probably let him.'

Initially the parents thought the tub may have been tampered with by a Halloween prankster, but when they checked it was still sealed. 

Ms Cole added: 'It would have been horrible if a younger child had found the bolt.' 

It is not known in which M&S the nuts, costing £2.99, were bought but Ms Cole took the tub into a city centre store, where the manager said they would investigate.

An M&S spokesman said: 'We're sorry to hear about Miss Cole's complaint.

'Quality is extremely important to us so we've asked the customer to send us the fruit and nut pot, which she has done, and we're now investigating further.'

Last week pianist Lee Reed was horrified after he discovered a dead earwig in his M&S nutty super wholefood salad. The retailer apologised and gave him a £15 voucher, saying the discovery was an 'isolated incident.' 

It is also not the first time a screw has been found lurking in a bag of sweets. Last year Stephen Friel, 47, found a screw in a bag of Haribo sweets in his nine-year-old daughter's Christmas stocking.
