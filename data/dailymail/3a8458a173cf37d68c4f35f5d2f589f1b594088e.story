A stunning long-range volley from former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne handed Wolfsburg a share of the spoils against Lille, after Liverpool loan striker Divock Origi had scored for the French side.

On a night when several Premier League's loan stars made an impact in the Europa League, Origi had broken the deadlock from the penalty spot in the 77th minute following a Ricardo Rodriguez handball.

But De Bruyne leveled things up with a stunning strike five minutes later. The ex-Chelsea man let fly following a cleared corner, finding the top corner with the sweetest of hits.
