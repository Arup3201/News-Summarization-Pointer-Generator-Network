A four-year-old boy suffers from a rare condition that means a scrape or an argument could kill him, his parents say.

Four-year-old Morgan Taylor has adrenal insufficiency which means he cannot naturally deal with physical or emotional setbacks.

The youngster’s body does not produce the stress hormone cortisol, and so his body will begin to shut down if he is not administered a life-saving injection within 30 minutes of any stressful event.

Morgan Taylor, four, has adrenal insufficiency which means his body doesn't produce the stress hormone cortisol. As a result, without a life-saving cortisol injection after stressful events, his body would shut down

After Morgan started school in Burnley his mother, Susan Murwald, 39, said: ‘Every day I watch the clock, waiting for him to come home.

‘I miss him and it’s hard because I worry about anything happening.

‘He should be my responsibility, but I have to let him be a normal little boy and go to school.’

Morgan was diagnosed with the condition after being born by emergency caesarean at 28 weeks, weighing just 1lb 8oz.

Morgan (pictured with his mother, Susan) was born at 28 weeks weighing just 1lb 8oz. When he was a week old he developed an infection and his parents were told he would not survive

Morgan (pictured with his mother, Susan, father, Neil, sister Abbey, 14, and brother, Ollie, 18-months) also has growth problems, chronic lung disease, a heart defect and behavioural problems

When he was a week old, he contracted
an infection in his bowel and Susan, and his father Neil, were told to 
expect the worse by doctors who said he was not strong enough to 
survive.

The adrenal glands, which are found at the top of the kidneys, produce steroid hormones that are essential for life - cortisol and aldosterone.

Cortisol mobilises nutrients, enables the body to fight inflammation, stimulates the liver to produce blood sugar and helps control the amount of water in the body.

Adrenal insufficiency is caused by the failure of the adrenal glands to produce sufficient (or any) cortisol.

A prolonged lack of the hormone causes severe fatigue, depression, loss of appetite and weight loss.

Cortisol is particularly important when the body is subjected to stress, such as surgery, trauma or a serious infection.

If the adrenal glands do not produce cortisol, the body might not be able to cope with this kind of major stress.

This causes a life-threatening condition called adrenal crisis which causes symptoms including low blood pressure, stomach pain, nausea and fever.

There are a number of potential causes for adrenal insufficiency including an infection, an autoimmune disease and pituitary gland tumours.

Ms Murwald, a 
mother-of-five, said: ‘We knew we were having a small baby, but we 
didn’t know there was anything medically wrong with Morgan until he was 
born.

‘They sent us home for the night to be with our other children and said they would call as soon as he started to deteriorate.

‘It was so upsetting to be told our baby wasn’t going to last the night.

‘We had only had him a week and I hadn’t even been able to give him a cuddle.’

But amazingly, the call never came and the couple returned to the hospital the following morning to learn that their little boy was pulling through.

‘It was a massive turning point for Morgan,’ Ms Murwald said.

However, Morgan has be left with adrenal insufficiency which makes him vulnerable to physical and mental stress.

Other symptoms of the condition include fatigue and muscle weakness, dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite and stomach ache.

Mr
Taylor, a 37-year-old engineer, said: ‘If you or I fall over, our body 
will deal with the stress of that situation, but Morgan’s body can’t do 
that.

‘Even if he had an argument with someone, he wouldn’t be able to sit down and calm himself down. He’s just not capable.

‘Any
kind of shock to the system, physically or emotionally, means he needs a
cortisol injection as his body won’t naturally release it.

Morgan has just started school but because of his condition is cannot play with the other children in the playground in case he becomes stressed

Morgan (pictured at school with Grace Naylor, four) is still small for his age and his parents do not know what the future holds for him

‘If he doesn’t get the injection, his
body will start to shut down and he becomes clammy, lethargic and run 
down and he would eventually die.

‘We have to take his kit wherever we go as just a trip to the park or the shops can be dangerous.’

Ms
Murwald has stayed at home to look after Morgan, who also has growth 
problems, chronic lung disease, a heart defect and behavioural problems.

All of the staff at Morgan's school are trained to administer his cortisol injections if he needs them

She said: ‘I worry about him and he’s in a class with other children who are much bigger than him. He has to really think about what he’s doing.

‘He knows all about his condition and he knows what the injections are for.

‘He’s aware that he has to be cautious and knows he’s not allowed to play contact sports. We have had to drill it into him.’

Ms Murwald said: 'I worry about him and he's in a class with other children who are much bigger than him. He has to really think about what he's doing'

All of the staff on the school premises are trained to administer cortisol injections to Morgan if he needs them.

‘I feel more comfortable because of that,’ said Ms Murwald. ‘All the staff came forward to be trained which is nice because they didn’t have to.

‘But I can’t help but worry that everything will be OK as he has complex medical needs, just like any parent would.

Ms Murwald said: 'He's very happy and incredibly cheeky, and although he's got this illness we just have to deal with it. It's heart breaking really because he's always got a smile on his face no matter what. We don't know what the future holds for him but while he's happy that's all we can ask for'
