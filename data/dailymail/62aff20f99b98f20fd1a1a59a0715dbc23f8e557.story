They decided to make their own version with strangers in the street

When the creators of the Italian version discovered 'those strangers were in fact actors playing a part for the cameras in a studio' they said they felt 'cheated' and decided to make their own version in Italy.

They went out in the streets and asked total strangers - male and female - to have a kiss on camera.

Although many participants looked sheepish at first, one couple then became so involved that they stopped, looked at each other, and then started again.

When many of the pairs broke apart they looked slightly embarrassed at getting caught up in the moment of passion.

'We took to the streets and told random people we bumped into about this video, and how it broke our hearts,' said the creators

On their website the creators wrote: 'By now you must have seen 'First Kiss' from Tatia Pilieva, and many of you probably felt cheated when you found out that those strangers were in fact actors playing a part for the cameras in a studio.

'This broke my heart so much that I just couldn't help it. I called four friends that didn't know each other, and on Friday the 14th, instead of going to work, we all went downtown.

'We took to the streets and told random people we bumped into about this video, and how it broke our hearts. We asked them to take up a needle and thread to help us mend it with real kisses.

'This video is the result of that day. It left us exhausted, shaking, tired, and in love with life like never before.'
