Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil is the latest football star to take on the ice bucket challenge before nominating pop star Rihanna and then his girlfriend.

The World Cup winner posted a video on his Instagram of his attempt and shivered after standing under the fall of ice.

Ozil thanked Bayern Munich defender Jerome Boateng and DJ Steve Aoki for their nominations on his Instagram before returning the favour for pop star Rihanna, his girlfriend Mandy Capristo and Chicago Bulls star Derrick Rose.

Star pals: Ozil met Derrick Rose at a USA basketball training camp during the summer on holiday in Las Vegas

The 25-year-old met Rihanna after the Germans triumphed to win the World Cup in Brazil this summer.

The German playmaker then met Derrick Rose in Las Vegas on holiday ahead of linking back up with Arsenal for pre-season training earlier this months, after his gruelling World Cup campaign.

Ozil will hope to play an integral part in Arsenal’s success this campaign as the Gunners look to build on winning the FA Cup last season along with the season opening Community Shield victory over Manchester City.
