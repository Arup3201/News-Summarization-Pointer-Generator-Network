Two thieves have been caught on camera stealing poppy tins as part of a three day spree to raid the charity collections just before Remembrance Sunday.

Police are looking for the two men who struck a tea room, pharmacy and three shops in Solihull within a few hours - with some of the thefts taking place within minutes of each other.

Their actions have been denounced as a 'wicked and deplorable crime', taking money that had been donated to help war veterans.

West Midlands Police has released CCTV footage of the pair as they struck shops and a garden centre over three days to repeatedly swipe collection tins, and are now trying to trace them.

Police have released CCTV of two men they are trying to find in connection with a string of thefts of poppy collection tins in the West Midlands. A worker in One Stop (pictured) grabbed back one of the tins from the thief

One of the men frequently appears in a 'deerstalker hat.'

At 11.35am last Monday the men walked into Meriden Tea Rooms on Fillongley Road, Solihull and pretended to wait to be seated.

Security cameras showed one of them take a poppy tin on the counter and calmly place it under his jacket before walking out.

They were then seen getting into a green coloured car - possibly a Ford Focus - and speeding off. 

Then at around 2pm on the same day, a poppy tin was stolen from Balsall Common Pharmacy after a man walked in and placed it in a plastic bag.

At 5.45pm the thieves attempted to steal an appeal tin from Blooms Garden Centre in nearby Hampton-in-Arden, but were unsuccessful because it was chained to the counter.

Minutes later at 6.30pm, one of the men went into One Stop in Knowle, and tried to steal a poppy tin by cutting the string attaching it to the counter. But he was spotted by a worker who grabbed the tin and the man fled the store. 

Just 30 minutes later, at around 7pm, another tin was stolen from Threshers on Widney Road also in Knowle.

The man appears to have got away with the theft, putting the scissors and collection tin in his bag at the store

The next day, a man walked into Murco petrol station in Knowle, at 2pm and again stuffed a tin under his jacket before walking out.

Officers also believe the pair targeted Lloyds Pharmacy in Meriden, as well as the butchers and dry cleaners in Balsall Common.

Inspector Allan Green, who is investigating the thefts, said: 'There are no circumstances under which such thefts are justifiable.

'This is a wicked and deplorable crime and we need the public to help us catch those responsible.

The string of thefts have taken place days before Remembrance Sunday as preparations are made at Westminster Abbey with red poppies on crosses being planted at the Field of Remembrance 

'This money was intended for service men and women, veterans and their families - people who have risked their lives for our country, and the loved ones of those who gave their lives doing so.

'From our CCTV inquiries, it appears one man usually removes the tin while the other acts as a distraction to anyone who may try and disturb him.

'The first man is described as white, 6ft, of a slim build and in his 20s. He is often seen wearing a distinctive-checked deerstalker hat.

'The other man is described as black, around 5ft 11ins, of a medium build and is also in his 20s.

'We are doing all we can to track down the pair but in the meantime, we would urge any businesses with poppy tins to be vigilant and report any thefts to us at the earliest opportunity.'

Anyone with information about the identity of the men is urged to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
