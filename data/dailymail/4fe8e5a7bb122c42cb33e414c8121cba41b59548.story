Pope Francis brought some much-needed Christmas cheer to sick children today as he continued to ride a wave of popularity - while telling his staff that 'gossip' was spoiling their service to God.

The 77-year-old pontiff walked minutes from his home to bless and kiss smiling youngsters of all colours and creeds at the Bambin Gesu children's hospital in Vatican City.

His visit, echoing one in 2005 by his predecessor Benedict XVI, came after the moderniser was named person of the year by Time magazine - which said he had pulled the papacy 'out of the palace and into the streets'.

After his election in March he washed Muslim prisoners' feet, caught shuttle buses with other bishops and called his local newsagent in Argentina to cancel his delivery when he was elected Pope.

Christmas spirit: Pope Francis waves to the cameras today. He is preparing for his first Christmas Day address

This week he handed Christmas packages with an international calling card and a Rome metro travel card to 2,000 immigrants living at a shelter.

But the pontiff's Christmas address today to the Vatican Curia, the 1.2 billion-strong church's governmental arm, exposed the gossip, infighting and bureaucracy which still dogs the Holy See.

He said the Curia had its 'saints' but warned staff to be more professional to avoid 'a slow drift downwards toward mediocrity'.

'When the attitude is no longer one of service to the
 particular churches and their bishops, the structure of the Curia turns
 into a ponderous, bureaucratic customs house, constantly inspecting and
 questioning, hindering the working of the Holy Spirit and the growth of
 God's people,' he said.

He urged staff to exercise a 'conscientious
 objection to gossip', adding: 'I'm not simply 
moralising! Gossip is harmful to people, our work and our surroundings.'

Gossip is in no short supply in the 
Vatican, where the Pope's attempts to overhaul its ageing bureaucracy 
are fast taking effect.

The need for change ramped up last year when the secretive, closed world of the 
Vatican was exposed as a den of gossip by the leaks 
of papal documents from the previous Pope's butler.

Last week Pope Francis reshuffled the 
advisory body of the powerful Congregation for Bishops, the office that 
vets all the world's bishop nominations.

He has already removed the arch-conservative
 American Cardinal Raymond Burke, a key figure in the U.S. culture wars 
over abortion and gay marriage, and the hard-line head of Italy's bishops, Cardinal Mauro 
Piacenza.

In the next few weeks he will name his first batch of
 cardinals and in February will preside over the third summit of his 'Group of Eight' cardinal advisers, who are expected to put forward a 
first round of plans for revamping the Holy See bureaucracy.

Two commissions of inquiry, meanwhile, will work on reforming the troubled Vatican bank and
 rationalizing the Holy See's finances.

Four big-name consulting 
firms - Promontory Financial Group, KPMG, EY and McKinsey & Co. - 
have been contracted for various projects.

The Pope has said he wants a Curia more responsive to the needs of local bishops, who have long complained of Rome's slow or unhelpful interventions in their work.

He also said he wants the church as a whole to be less consumed with moralising over issues like gay marriage than showing mercy to the needy.
