Thailand has vowed for the first time to take steps towards putting an end to the country's ivory trade, as wildlife groups warned the slaughter of elephants will continue until a ban is imposed.

The country's domestic ivory trade is currently legal, but activists say smuggled African tusks are mixed in with native stocks, and that skyrocketing demand in Thailand is helping to fuel the worst poaching crisis in sub-Saharan Africa in 20 years.

Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra has pledged to tighten controls on the country's local tusk trade and to 'work towards' putting an end to the trade altogether, but failed to give a timeline for implementing a ban.

Ms Yingluck made the pledge during the opening meeting of the 178-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Bangkok this week.

She said her government would tighten controls on Thailand's local tusk trade by systematically registering domestic elephants and ivory products. Then, 'as a next step, we will work towards amending the national legislation with the goal of putting an end to (the) ivory trade and to be in line with international norms', she said.

But there was no timeline and Theerapat Prayurasiddhi, deputy director of Thailand's department of parks and wildlife, said there were no immediate plans for a domestic ban.

He said that could happen 'step by step in the future - maybe', but called it 'the long-term goal'. For now, the government will focus on boosting measures to tighten domestic trade controls and slow the flow of African ivory from entering Thai markets.

Thai traders currently have the right to buy or sell ivory obtained legally from domesticated stocks, and Mr Theerapat said taking those rights away could be tantamount to the struggle to ban assault weapons in the United States.

'You cannot change everything overnight,' he said. 'It's going to take time.'

Asked how Thailand's legislation might be amended, he said there was a push to add African elephants to Thailand's own lists of protected species, a move that would allow authorities to impose higher fines and harsher jail terms on smugglers.

Carlos Drews, head of the World Wildlife Fund's delegation to Cites, welcomed Ms Yingluck's pledge but said 'the fight to stop wildlife crime and shut down Thailand's ivory markets is not over'.

Ms Yingluck 'now needs to provide a timeline for this ban and ensure that it takes place as a matter of urgency, because the slaughter of elephants continues', he said.

Around 70 years ago, up to five million elephants are believed to have roamed sub-Saharan Africa.

Today, just several hundred thousand are left. Last year, 32,000 elephants were killed on the continent, according to the Born Free Foundation, which says black-market ivory sells for around £865 per pound; much of it ends up as tourist trinkets.

Thailand is one of the world's top destinations for smuggled ivory - second only to China, according to the wildlife monitoring network TRAFFIC. The group has called for Cites members to impose economic trade sanctions against Thailand, along with Nigeria and Congo, which would halt those nations' ability to trade in all 35,000 species regulated by the convention.

Cites banned the international ivory trade in 1989. But the move never addressed domestic markets like Thailand's, where trading remains legal as long as only ivory from domesticated elephants is involved.

Animals such as rhinos, tigers and orangutans will not be left in the wild in 30 years' time, more than half of Britons believe.

The poll finding comes as the Government launches a new 'If They're Gone' campaign to highlight the threats to some of the world's highest-profile endangered species - rhinos, elephants, tigers and orangutans - and the action people can take to help them.

Launching the campaign, involving more than 20 wildlife groups, zoos and safari parks, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said he did not want future generations to think of the four species in the same way he thought of the dodo.

The survey of more than 1,700 people for the campaign found that 54% did not think those animals will be left in the wild in 30 years' time.

The concern over the fate of species such as rhinos is mirrored by the experts, with Tusk Trust's chief executive Charlie Mayhew warning that this year one rhino has been lost to poachers every 11 hours, on average.

He said: 'If this poaching continues to escalate, a species which has existed on this planet for 40 million years faces the very real prospect of extinction in our lifetime.

'We cannot be the generation that allows this to happen and Tusk is working hard to preserve all endangered species.'

The Government's campaign comes as countries meet in Thailand for the latest meeting of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), where efforts to protect species such as rhinos, elephants and sharks are on the agenda.

The Duke of Cambridge, royal patron of the Tusk Trust, has urged the conference to do more to protect rhinos and elephants from illegal killing for their ivory and horn, which has become extremely valuable for use in traditional Asian medicine.

The UK Government is calling for countries attending the meeting to maintain the ban on ivory sales and to protect rhinos by bringing in stricter controls on the export and re-export of rhino horn.

The campaign, launched today, also outlines how the public can help protect endangered species, urging them to think before they buy anything that could be made from or contain body parts of endangered species, ask where products have come from and get involved with wildlife conservation projects.

Launching the campaign at the Cotswold Wildlife Park, Mr Paterson said: 'If They're Gone aims to raise awareness and encourage individuals to take action to protect four of the planet's most iconic species, rhinos, elephants, orangutans and tigers, from extinction.

'It's by working together that we show international leadership in the fight against the disastrous trade in wildlife and the devastating impact of deforestation.'

He added: 'There are no medicinal benefits to traditional Asian medicines that contain animal parts and by turning your back on them you can help to protect these iconic animals.'

Meanwhile, the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has gathered 40,000 signatures for a petition calling on Cites to implement a full ban on any trade in ivory to stop the poaching of African elephants.

A recent report by conservation charity WWF warned that trafficking of wildlife products, from rhino horn to illegal timber, is one of the world's biggest trades, worth £12 billion a year, and is driving species towards extinction, funding war and damaging communities.
