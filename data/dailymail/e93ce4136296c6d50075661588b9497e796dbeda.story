When Stephen Colbert did his daily stalk of himself, he discovered an upsetting error - he was too short.

Searching the internet for his own height, the political satirist found that Google listed him as being 5ft 10ins, one inch shorter than he is in real life.

The 50-year-old host used his own talk show as platform to jokily threaten Google and it's CEO Larry Page with severe reprisals if his height-issue was not addressed.

'I'm THIS much taller, Google!': Stephen Colbert did some internet stalking of himself and discovered he was listed as 5ft 10in - one inch too short - on Google

Speaking on his show The Colbert Report, the political satirist feigned upset, with a serious undertone.

Addressing Mr Page directly, Colbert demanded 'a retraction, an investigation, an apology and a substantial cash settlement.'

He joked that he wanted the 5'11 glory he shares with Brad Pitt and Russell Crowe, rather than share 'the stale air' of the (5ft10in) Johnny Depp.

'All I want is the height I deserve. And I fought for every inch, and no one, but no one, is taking that away from me. Especially not Larry Page, who according to Google, is 5'11'.'

Jibe: Colbert made a joked about making a 'physical threat' to Google CEO Larry Page

'Fix it, or I will fix you, Page. And yes, that is a physical threat.'

Knowing that a man like Colbert is not a wrath one wishes to invoke, Google quickly took action on the matter - in the best way possible.

Now if you google 'How tall is Stephen Colbert?', it results in '5ft 10.5ins (1.79m -ish)'.

Colbert's height is also compared to other talkshow hosts - Larry Page (5ft 11ins) and Conan O'Brien (6ft 4ins).

However, in another jibe from Google, not-exactly-NBA-material Jon Stewart is simply referred to as 'Shorter'.
