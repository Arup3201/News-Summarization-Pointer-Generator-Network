British scientists could have found the key to wiping out malaria-carrying mosquitoes - by developing a genetically modified species that produces just male offspring.

Malaria is spread by infected female mosquitoes who pass on the killer disease when they bite humans.

But Imperial College London researchers looked to genetics to disrupt the breeding of mosquitoes so fewer females are produced, which should see mosquitoes die out within a few generations.

In lab tests they have modified mosquitoes to produce sperm that will only create males, pioneering a fresh approach to eradicating malaria.

Genetically modified mosquitoes that almost exclusively produce male offspring could wipe out malaria

The new genetic method distorts the sex ratio of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, the main transmitters of the malaria parasite.

In
 the first laboratory tests, the method created a fully fertile mosquito
 strain that produced 95 per cent male offspring, the study published in
 the journal Nature Communications revealed.

These were introduced to five caged wild-type mosquito populations.

In four of the five cages, this eliminated the entire population within six generations, because of the lack of females.

The
 hope is that if this could be replicated in the wild, this would 
ultimately cause the malaria-carrying mosquito population to crash.

This is the first time that scientists have been able to manipulate the sex ratios of mosquito populations.

Since
 the millennium increased prevention and control measures have reduced 
global malaria mortality rates by 42 per cent, but the disease remains a
 prevalent killer especially in vulnerable sub-Saharan African regions.

Malaria
 control has also been threatened by the spread of insecticide resistant
 mosquitoes and malaria parasites resistant to drugs.

Over 3.4 billion people are at risk from contracting malaria and an estimated 627,000 people die each year from the disease.

Professor
 Andrea Crisanti from the Department of Life Sciences said: 'Malaria is 
debilitating and often fatal and we need to find new ways of tackling 
it. We think our innovative approach is a huge step forward.

'For
 the very first time, we have been able to inhibit the production of 
female offspring in the laboratory and this provides a new means to 
eliminate the disease.'

Colleague Dr Nikolai Windbichler added: 'What is most promising about our results is that they are self-sustaining.

'Once
 modified mosquitoes are introduced, males will start to produce mainly 
sons, and their sons will do the same, so essentially the mosquitoes 
carry out the work for us.'

In this new experiment the scientists inserted a DNA cutting enzyme called I-PpoI into Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes.

In
 normal reproduction, half of the sperm bear the X chromosome and will 
produce female offspring, and the other half bear the Y chromosome and 
produce male offspring.

The
 enzyme that the researchers used works by cutting the DNA of the X 
chromosome during production of sperm, so that almost no functioning 
sperm carry the female X chromosome.

As a result the offspring of the genetically modified mosquitoes was almost exclusively male.

It took the researchers six years to produce an effective variant of the enzyme.

Dr
 Roberto Galizi said: 'The research is still in its early days, but I am
 really hopeful that this new approach could ultimately lead to a cheap 
and effective way to eliminate malaria from entire regions.

'Our goal is to enable people to live freely without the threat of this deadly disease.'

If they were released into the wild, they could wipe out disease-carrying insects by denying them the opportunity to breed through lack of females
