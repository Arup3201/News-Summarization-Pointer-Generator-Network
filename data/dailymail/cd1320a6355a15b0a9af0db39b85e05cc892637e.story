Denver Broncos wide receiver Wes Welker has denied taking MDMA after being suspended for the first four games of the 2014 season for testing positive for amphetamines.

Welker violated the NFL's performance-enhancing substances policy but wrote an email to the Denver Post denying taking the party drug.

'I wouldn't have any idea where to get a Molly or what a Molly is', Welker wrote.

Wes Welker (pictured in August) denies that he knowingly took an illegal substance

'That's a joke. I don't do marijuana, I don't do drugs. I don't do any drugs', he added. 

It was alleged that Welker consumed MDMA at the Kentucky Derby, to which he said that someone must have slipped it into his drink, without him knowing.

The league never makes public what substances athletes test positive for but another report alleged it was the banned stimulant Adderall, a drug prescribed to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), found in his system.

In his email to the Post, Welker said he was 'as shocked as everyone' and would fight to clear his name.

'I would NEVER knowingly take a substance to gain a competitive advantage in any way,' he said.

'I have never been concerned with the league's performance enhancing or drug abuse policies because under no scenario would they ever apply to me.

'But I now know that (drug-policy procedures) are clearly flawed, and I will do everything in my power to ensure they are corrected, so other individuals and teams aren't negatively affected so rashly like this.'

The news comes just five days before the Broncos, who lost last season's Super Bowl, begin their season with a home game against the Indianapolis Colts.

'Tonight's news regarding Wes is very disappointing for our team, but we understand the league's authority in this area,' Denver coach John Fox said on the team's official website.

'I have no doubt that Wes will remain focused on his preparations for the season and stay in excellent shape during his time away from the team.'

Welker, who has been to the Pro Bowl five times, is a key receiver for Denver quarterback Peyton Manning and made 778 yards on 73 receptions last year.       (Reporting By Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina, editing by Nick Mulvenney)
