Islamic State has renewed its call for followers to carry out lone wolf killings of Australians and citizens from four other countries in the alliance against the militant group.

The jihad group's latest call to arms in its propaganda magazine, Dabiq, was headlined, 'Rush to Support Your State, O Muslim'.

The article said it is very important that attacks take place in every country that has entered into the alliance against the Islamic State, especially the US, UK, France, Australia and Germany.

The article 'Rush to Support Your State, O Muslim', released in the jihad group's  propaganda magazine, Dabiq, calls on Muslims to act out violent killings on citizens from Australia, UK, US, Germany and France

'Every Muslim should get out of his house, find a crusader and kill him. Secrecy should be followed when planning and executing any attack,' says the fourth edition of the IS recruitment publication.

'The smaller the numbers of those involved and the less the discussion beforehand, the more likely it will be carried out without problems.

'One should not complicate the attacks by involving other parties, purchasing complex materials, or communicating with weak-hearted individuals.

'"Rely upon Allah and stab the crusader" should be the battle cry for all Islamic State patrons.'

Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the threat was directed to 'everyone' who did not align themselves with Islamic States' views,The Australian reported.

'This death cult wants to kill everyone who thinks, acts and worships differently,' Prime Minister Abbott said.

'That is why it’s important that Australia, along with our friends and allies including Muslim countries, Middle Eastern countries, does what we can to disrupt and deprive the death tolls at home and abroad.

'That is why we have our force in the Middle East, why we have upgraded security here in ­Australia.

'I want to assure the Australian people that we will do everything we humanly can to keep our country safe.'

There was a similar call three weeks ago for IS followers to attack non-Muslim Australians. 

At the time, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he was deeply concerned about the threat of lone wolf terrorism but urged Australians to remain calm and not inflame tensions within communities.
