The teenage son of a Sheikh led police on a high speed car chase the wrong way through a one way system in his mother's stolen Mercedes before crashing into a traffic light - but has avoided a driving ban.

The 16-year-old, from Kensington, London, who cannot be named for legal reasons, careered through red lights with five police cars in pursuit before smashing into the pole and then hitting a taxi.

The disturbing incident was caught on video by CCTV cameras in the area and shows the teenager tearing through the streets pursued by police patrol cars - at one point on the wrong side of the road - before he hits a traffic light with such force the pole is knocked over.

The 16-year-old son of a Sheikh, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is pictured driving on the wrong side of the road on a one way system before hitting a traffic light - but he has not been banned from driving

His driving was so erratic the first person to make an emergency call to police told the operator the car's driver must be under the influence of alcohol.

Police have now released CCTV footage of the chase after the teenager was sentenced to a 12 month rehabilitation order and 60 hours community service for his escapade - but no driving ban

Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard the teenager stole the car from outside his father's flat in a multi-million pound home in  Kensington, near to the Natural History Museum, on October 19 last year.

The boy claimed a friend had driven the car the 10 miles to a house in Kingston-upon-Thames.

CCTV footage from that night shows the black Mercedes speeding through the bus lane in Eden Street towards Clarence Street at 3.30am, before taking a wrong turn into oncoming traffic in Wheatfield Way.

Cars were stopped at a red light when the Mercedes smashed into the traffic light.

The chase only ended when the Mercedes crashed into a taxi, giving the driver minor whiplash.

Police then managed to dive into the car and put the handbrake on.

Last month the teenager pleaded guilty to  aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving.

At earlier hearings prosecutors said the driver was alleged to have nearly run into pedestrians on three different occasions during the chase, although this was disputed.

The youngster also denied driving into a police officer who tried to stop him.

His parents accompanied him at his sentencing in Hammersmith Magistrates' Court, where he spoke of his deep regret and his struggles with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

He sat on his mum's lap at one of the hearings, and kissed her hand at another hearing. 

His elderly father was also at the hearing, although the boy's parent's are now separated.

Kingston police sergeant Jim Dicks said at the time of the incident: 'He had done a complete circle of the town while being pursued.

'I don't think the driver knew where he was going - he just went round the town centre in circles.

'There were about four or five police cars involved so officers boxed him in.

'The windows got smashed and an officer dived into the car to put the handbrake up to stop him.

'I have not seen anything like this in Kingston for a long time.' 

Magistrate Julie Baldwin said she would enforce one of the harshest sentences she could in an aim to both punish and help rehabilitate him.

She said: 'It is almost a miracle that nothing worse happened. 

'There are a lot of people here rooting for you and a lot of agencies involved in this case.

'You have support from both of your parents and a successful road ahead of you is very achievable if you adhere to your order.'

The teenager told the court: 'I know that someone could have been seriously hurt and I would not have been able to live with myself knowing that I had done something that foolish and stupid.'

However, outside the courtroom after the sentencing the teenager realised his sentence had not included a driving ban. 

He excitedly shouted to his father that he was 'going to get straight on his moped' when he got home.

It is not the first time he has been in court in relation to a car.

He was given a warning for aggravated vehicle taking in March 2011, and also has other non-driving related convictions, which were not disclosed in court.

He was the subject of a youth rehabilitation order at the time of the crime.

Magistrates were asked to lift the anonymity of the boy, on the basis he was a repeat offender who had endangered lives and that the public had a right to know his name.

But they ruled that he was a vulnerable youth and revealing his identity was not in the public interest. 

The teenager was sentenced to a 12 month rehabilitation order and 60 hours community service for his escapade. 

He was also electronically tagged and will have to adhere to a curfew from the hours of 9pm to 7am for the next three months.
