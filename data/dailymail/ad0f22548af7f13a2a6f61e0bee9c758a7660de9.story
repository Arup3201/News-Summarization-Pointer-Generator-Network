More Americans over 50 are getting divorced than ever before.

A study out of Ohio’s Bowling Green State University found that 1 out of every 4 divorced person nationwide fits is considered a late in life divorcee.

Researchers at the university’s National Center for Family and Marriage Research say that number has doubled since 1990, though race and education level make some more likely to divorce after 50 than others.

Demographic shift: A study finds that Americans over 50 now account for 1 in 4 divorces. That's double the rate seen in 1990

Trending: More Americans over 50 are getting divorced than ever and at twice the rate in 1990, the trend could continue

The study used data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), which asks respondents if they’ve been divorced in the last 12 months.

When paired with other census data, the 
ACS allowed researchers Susan L. Brown and I-Fen Lin to pin age and 
other demographics onto a respondent’s divorce history.

A study out of Bowling Green State University-based National Center for Family and Marriage Research gives surprising results about older Americans and divorces.

1 out of 4 divorces now involve a person over age 50.

That number has more than doubled since 1990, when that number was1 in 10.

Black Americans are the most likely to divorce late in life.

They are followed by Hispanics, then whites, and Asians in late in life marriage statistics.

Better educated Americans are less likely to divorce after 50 than are the less educated.

Lead researcher Susan L. Brown attributes the change to several factors, including:

First off, the data told them that divorce rates had continue to increase in those over 50 while rates had begun to plateau in other group.

‘This surprised us, because the rate for younger people has leveled off,’ Brown, a sociology professor, told the Chicago Tribune. ‘In 1990, only 1 in 10 divorces were people 50 and older.’

A recent example of the trend can be seen in documentary filmmaker Michael Moore.

In June, Moore filed a complaint against his wife Kathleen Glynn, who is 55, after 21 years of marriage.

According to Brown, the change is rooted in several contemporary demographic shifts.

Brown says that ‘that huge segment of baby boomers’ who have now entered their ‘senior’ years are simply more prevalent.

She also attributes the change to the fact that more women are now in the workplace and, thus, ‘don't have to stay in empty-shell marriages for the money.’

Finally, Brown suggests that fewer people are now observant of their church rules against divorce.

In addition to age, the study found that race affected the likelihood of divorce.

African-Americans were most likely to divorce late in life. Hispanics less likely, followed by whites and Asians, who were the least likely to divorce after 50.

Education level also played a role and the more you’ve had the less likely you are to divorce.

Meanwhile, rates of widowhood, the study revealed, have gone down. However, Brown says society shouldn’t forget the plight of yesterday’s spouse left alone in his or her old age.

‘We need to look at these people the way we've looked at widowhood. Many need help financially,’ she says. ‘They had fewer kids, and the kids aren't always nearby, so they more often have to look outside the family for caregiving.’

Race affected late in life divorce as well. Blacks were the most likely to get one, followed by Hispanics, then whites, then Asians

Study from Ohio's Bowling Green State University shows that 1 in 4 divorces now involve someone 50 or over

That's over twice the 1 in 10 statistic found in 1990
