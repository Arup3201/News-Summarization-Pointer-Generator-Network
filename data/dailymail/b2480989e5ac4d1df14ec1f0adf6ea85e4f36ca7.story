The last remaining French citizen held abroad by a terrorist group has been freed by Al Qaeda militants kidnapped him in Mali three years ago.

Serge Lazarevic, 51, was freed by his captors in the desert city of Kidal this morning and is in 'relatively good health',  French President Francois Hollande revealed.

He was snatched by armed men from the group known as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb on November 24, 2011 while on a business trip with fellow Frenchman Philippe Verdon.

There was no immediate information on how the release was secured or whether France paid ransom money to the group, as is often been demanded by Islamist groups after a kidnapping.

Hostage: After Serge Lazarevic's appearance with a thick beard and dark headdress in the last Al Qaeda video, his daughter Diane urged the French President to do everything possible to secure his release

Lazarevic is the last of more than a dozen French citizens taken captive in recent years, with those held in Africa reaching a high of 15 last year. 

Four journalists held by Syrian jihadists were released earlier this year.

'Our hostage Serge Lazarevic, our last hostage, is free,' Hollande said this morning. 'There are no more French hostages in any country in the world,' he added.

Hollande said Lazarevic would be met by his daughter in Niger's capital Niamey before making his way back to France where he and his family would be welcomed by the president.

'He is in relatively good health, despite the gruelling conditions of his long captivity,' Hollande said.

A Malian security source explained that the final stages of Lazarevic's release took place in the city of Kidal but refused to say whether a ransom payment or prisoner exchange took place.

During his three years in captivity, Lazaravic appeared in several  videos released by Al Qaeda.

The most recent video emerged in November and showed Lazaravic claiming to be so gravely ill that he believed his life was in danger.

Fears spiked for the safety of the towering Frenchman of Serbian origin in September after hiker Herve Gourdel was abducted in neighbouring Algeria and beheaded  by ISIS-linked militants.

After Lazarevic's appearance with a thick beard and dark headdress in the last Al Qaeda video, his daughter Diane urged Hollande to do everything possible to secure his release in time for Christmas.

Kidnapped at a small hotel in Hombori in northern Mali, Lazarevic and Verdon were held captive during one of the most turbulent periods of the country's history.

The pair, who worked in security and construction, were accused of being French intelligence agents  by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Their men's families have always denied these allegations.

They paid were in the hands of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb as it and other hardline Islamist groups launched a takeover of vast areas of northern Mali in 2012, and as they were in turn ousted by the French army who intervened in January the following year.

Verdon, who suffered from an ulcer and tachycardia - an abnormally fast heartbeat - was found shot dead last year, and those close to his family suggested he had been executed as he was unwell.

Uncertainty remains over the fate of another French hostage, Gilberto Rodrigues Leal, whose death was claimed by an Al-Qaeda splinter group but whose remains have never been found.

'We have the grimmest information concerning him. His family knows this. But, France has no more hostages, it must have no more hostages,' Hollande said.

Hollande thanked authorities in Mali and Niger for their assistance in securing Lazarevic's release.

'This liberation was the result of intense and continued efforts from authorities both in Niger and Mali,' the presidency in Niamey said in a statement.

While the details of Lazarevic's release were not given, France has repeatedly denied paying ransoms despite being accused of using back-channels to do so by other Western nations.

'France does not pay ransoms, nor does France engage in prisoner exchanges,' Hollande said in September. But he added: 'This does not mean that countries do not do it. It has happened that some countries, to help us, do it. That I concede.'

Failed rescue: Only this week British-born American photographer Luke Somers (left) was shot dead by Al Qaeda militants in Yemen after U.S special forces attempted to carry out a rescue operation rather than make a ransom payment to the terror group. South African teacher Pierre Korkie (right) was also executed

Former anti-terrorism judge Alain Marsaud was far more sceptical on the subject of a paid ransom. 'There is no reason for heated debate. We pay, we pay and that is all,' he told RTL radio. 

'There is no release if there is no payment. Someone paid, if not the government, a business or insurance company.'

The practice of paying ransom money to terrorist organisations is highly controversial, as the common view is that they only encourage further kidnappings at a later date.

Nevertheless the majority of foreign nationals held by the likes of Al Qaeda and ISIS have been freed, with the terrorist groups themselves claiming Britain and the United States  are the only countries who do not make secret payments, often totalling millions of pounds.

Only this week British-born American photographer Luke Somers was shot dead by Al Qaeda militants in Yemen while U.S special forces attempted to carry out a rescue operation.

The mission was ordered by Barack Obama after terrorists had on Thursday threatened to kill photographer Luke Somers, 33, within 72 hours unless a ransom was paid.

Another hostage, South African teacher Pierre Korkie, 56, was also executed by captors in the midst of the raid, US officials said.
