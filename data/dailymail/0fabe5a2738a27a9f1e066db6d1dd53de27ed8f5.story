One of the longest standing mysteries of migration has finally been solved after scientists discovered where the UK's Painted Lady butterflies go each autumn.

The large, colourful butterflies, commonly seen in the UK countryside, migrates to our shores in varying numbers from the continent each summer.

But until now scientists had no idea whether the Painted Lady made the return journey at the end of summer, like the closely related Red Admiral, or simply died in the UK.

Thanks to a massive survey of the creatures' habits, it has now been revealed that they make an epic intergenerational journey each year spanning thousands of miles from Africa to the Arctic and back again.

In one of the largest citizen science projects ever conducted, scientists from Butterfly Conservation, the NERC Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and Rothamsted Research amongst others, discovered exactly what happens to Painted Ladies each autumn.

More than 60,000 public sightings of 
the butterfly were collected across Europe during 2009, with 10,000 
British observers taking part.

Scientists also used radar to track their
movements across southern England.

They discovered that the Painted Lady did indeed migrate south each autumn but made this return journey at high altitude out of view of butterfly observers on the ground.

Radar records revealed that Painted Ladies fly at an average altitude of over 500m (1,640ft) on their southbound trip and can clock up speeds of up to 30mph by selecting favourable conditions.

The findings also revealed that the species undertakes a phenomenal 9,000 mile round trip from tropical Africa to the Arctic Circle.

That's almost double the length of the famous migrations undertaken by Monarch butterflies in North America.

The whole journey is not undertaken by individual butterflies but is a series of steps by up to six successive generations.

Painted Ladies returning to Africa in the autumn are thus several generations removed from their ancestors who left Africa earlier in the year.

The UK's first major study of 'flying ant day' has revealed not one but two flying ant days, and indeed large numbers of ants were reported over two flying ant weeks.

When the UK’s garden ants took to the air this summer, the Society of Biology received over 6,000 reports from members of the public as part of its first flying ant survey.

About one-in-five sightings happened on Tuesday 24th July, and another one in five came two weeks later on Wednesday 8th August. These peaks were extremely striking, but still these two flying ant days accounted for fewer than half of the records.

In fact, flying ants were a common sight for the days in July and August around the two peaks.

The time between the two peaks was a period of low pressure, which is usually associated with clouds, wind and rain. This suggests that the weather had a large role to play in determining when the ants flew.

Professor Adam Hart, an ecologist at the University of Gloucestershire, said: 'We found a relationship between flying ant swarms and weather conditions, which we expected, and geographical variation, which we didn’t expect.'

Richard Fox, Surveys Manager at Butterfly Conservation, was one of the report authors. He said: 'The extent of the annual journey undertaken by the Painted Lady butterfly is astonishing.

'This tiny creature weighing less than a gram, with a brain the size of a pin head and no opportunity to learn from older, experienced individuals, undertakes an epic intercontinental migration in order to find plants for its caterpillars to eat.

'Once thought to be blindly led, at the mercy of the wind, into an evolutionary dead end in the lethal British winter, this amazing combination of mass-participation citizen science and cutting edge technology has shown Painted Ladies to be sophisticated travellers.

'We are extremely grateful to the many thousands of members of the public who reported Painted Lady sightings and contributed to this extraordinary discovery.'

Radar in Hampshire operated by Rothamsted Research revealed that around 11million high-flying Painted Ladies entered the UK in spring 2009 with 26 million departing in autumn.

Dr Jason Chapman, a researcher at Rothamsted Research, who led the radar studies of Painted Ladies, said: 'The apparent lack of a return migration of the late-summer generation of Painted Lady butterflies was one of the greatest enigmas in insect migration ecology.

'But, through a combination of traditional monitoring by butterfly enthusiasts and new radar techniques, we have finally solved this long-standing puzzle.

'Migrant insects continue to amaze the public and research community alike as they are capable of carrying out the most remarkable journeys.'
