Usain Bolt's injury-plagued 2014 may have allowed American Justin Gatlin to slip in and take advantage to become the world's top sprinter, but the Jamaican speedster showed he is still the sport's undisputed king of cool.

In a week that has seen him strike his famed 'lightning bolt' pose in front of a packed Times Square in New York, Bolt was in a more relaxed mood on Monday morning whilst sharing some downtime with fellow athlete and close friend Edino Steele.

In a one-take shot the pair were filmed showing off their latest handshake, which consisted of around 30 combinations.

The pair's handshake combination consisted of around 30 moves, including a backwards low five (pictured) 

Posting the video to his Instagram, the six-time Olympic gold medalist wrote: 'Friendship is different hand shake is on point @edinosteele credit to the camera lady @miss_gabymolina #greatness #happiness #manofsteele #ForeverFaster.' 

After announcing that he plans to retire in 2017, with the World Championship 100 metres final in London pencilled in as his last individual race, Bolt is relishing the prospect of a fightback as he declared himself fit for the new season.

‘I live for competition. I thrive on competition. I live to compete against the best,' he told Sportsmail's Matt Lawton in an exclusive interview on Friday. 

‘My main aim now is to stay injury free this season so I go into Rio in peak form; at my best. Because in the past I’ve suffered these [injury] setbacks.’
