England and Leicester received mixed news on Tuesday as Tom Croft insisted it is ‘business as usual’ following a shoulder scare — only for club captain Ed Slater to be ruled out for the season.

Croft pulled out of Saturday’s Aviva Premiership opener against Newcastle after experiencing pain as a result of a stinger he suffered in pre-season.

Given Croft’s injury history — he sustained a career threatening neck injury two seasons ago and last year needed extensive surgery on torn knee ligaments — there were fears the England and Lions flanker could be facing another extended spell on the side-lines. But, speaking exclusively to Sportsmail, the 28-year-old revealed he is fit and ready to face Exeter at Sandy Park on Saturday.

Blow: England lock Ed Slater will be sidelined for several months after undergoing knee surgery

‘It’s business as usual as far as I’m concerned,’ he said. ‘I felt a bit of a twinge in the shoulder in training last week and we decided the safer option was to miss one game rather than risk a longer period of time off. The idea is to play against Exeter.

‘It’s the first full pre-season I’ve had for a long time and I’m feeling really good. I’ve put on some weight and am weighing in around 109kg (17st 2lb) but the speed tests say I’ve maintained my speed.

‘I’ve got a new knee and a new neck and I’m feeling stronger and fitter than I have done in years. My hunger for success is as strong as ever.’

The news was not so good for Croft’s team-mate Slater.

The highly regarded lock, a member of England’s elite player squad and an outside bet for next year’s World Cup, had knee surgery last week to repair damage sustained playing for England against Canterbury Crusaders in New Zealand in June. ‘It’s horrific for Ed in many ways,’ said Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill. ‘It’s a critical year for us and for him with the World Cup coming up and the likelihood is that he is not going to play a game between now and pre-season next year.’

Slater played on for 20 minutes after suffering the injury, which was only spotted when he returned to Leicester following the tour.

‘He has had his ACL reconstructed and he will be pretty much out for the season,’ Cockerill added.

‘Those things don’t show up well on scans and it looked relatively OK, so the first option was to rehab it and see how it settled. But it wasn’t settling so we had another look and it (ACL) was hanging on by a thread so the surgeon put him back together.’

Slater was not the only England hopeful to be dealt an injury setback as London Irish revealed their 24-year-old goal-kicking full back Tom Homer, who missed the bulk of last season with a groin problem, suffered significant knee ligament damage in Saturday’s loss to Harlequins.

Meanwhile Premier Rugby have ruled out any possibility of a change to the structure of the league following calls from Saracens chief executive Ed Griffiths to scrap the play-offs and introduce a fixture list more akin to Premier League football, with the side finishing top of the table at the end of the regular season being crowned champions.

Saracens lost last season’s play-off final in the dying minutes of extra time to Northampton after topping the league by nine points.

‘There are no plans to change the structure of the competition,’ said a Premier Rugby spokesman.

Bath wing Anthony Watson has signed a new deal that will keep at the Recreation Ground until 2017.
