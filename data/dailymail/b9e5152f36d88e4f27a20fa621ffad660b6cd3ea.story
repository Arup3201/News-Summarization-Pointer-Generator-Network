David Cameron has given ministers until the end of the week to find the money to help the heroes of Bomber Command pay for the unveiling of a memorial to their fallen comrades.

The Prime Minister intervened last night to insist that the shortfall for the cost of staging the event in June, which was attended by the Queen, will be met by the Government.

Anxious Second World War veterans had feared losing their homes as ministers refused to fill a £550,000 gap in funding for the poignant ceremony.

Survivors had already raised £6.5million
to build their own monument to recognise the sacrifice and bravery of 
the 55,573 comrades – nearly half the unit – who lost their lives during
raids against the Nazis.

But the hard-pressed Bomber Command Association trustees had also found themselves liable for the outstanding bill for the unveiling ceremony in Green Park, central London, which attracted more than 6,500 veterans, widows and children.

Until now, pleas to ministers for financial assistance to settle invoices from firms who provided seating, security, insurance and catering have fallen on deaf ears.

But last night, Downing Street sources said Mr Cameron had ordered a U-turn. Culture Secretary Maria Miller is expected to announce that her department will make up the shortfall as early as today.

‘The Prime Minister has taken a personal interest, given all the concerns that have been raised. He has said we need to find a way to sort this out and find the money that they need,’ said one source.

‘Downing Street is working with the Culture Department and we will have a result by the end of the week. We need to have a conversation with Bomber Command to establish precisely what they need and then we will find the money across Government.

‘Given the role veterans played in the War, and the commitment of all those involved in the memorial, the Prime Minister feels strongly that this is the right thing to do.’

Earlier in the day, former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth had urged ministers to ‘bite the bullet’ and make up the difference.

Praising the ‘decisive’ move, he said last night: ‘I am absolutely delighted. I know the Prime Minister has a very deep affection for the Armed Forces and it is excellent news that this now looks like it is going to be resolved.

‘The veterans made provision for a modest ceremony. But such was the public support and enthusiasm to honour those who gave their lives that the cost of the day itself increased enormously.

‘It would have been unthinkable that these guys should be required to dip into their own pockets.’

The Government has already waived £1million in VAT on building the memorial and provided £375,000-worth of support for the ceremony in the form of RAF personnel and aircraft. This was on top of £200,000 from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

Earlier in the day, mobile phone tycoon and philanthropist John Caudwell, who contributed £1.8million towards the memorial, had tried to shame ministers into action by suggesting he would make a further contribution as ‘a last resort’ if necessary.

The Phones4U founder said last night: ‘I have got to know a lot of these trustees as friends and the stress of all this has affected their health. If the Prime Minister has sorted it out, that is fabulous. I think it’s completely outrageous that the trustees have been in this position and I am not prepared to see them lose their homes.’

So three bold old men can now sleep more soundly in their beds – and the relatives of 55,573 heroic airmen can allow their blood pressure to return to normal.

The extraordinary saga of the Bomber Command memorial would appear to have been resolved and the trustees behind this magnificent monument will not be left to shoulder a thumping £550,000 bill for the opening ceremony after all.

Following an appeal by the Mail, a generous offer by the philanthropist, John Caudwell, and the wise intervention of the Prime Minister, common sense has prevailed.

Saga resolved: The scene in Green Park in June when the Queen unveiled the memorial

As the Mail reminded its readers yesterday, the new memorial, opened just over three months ago by the Queen, was long overdue. While all the other notable participants in the Second World War have long had a national monument to their endeavours, there had been none to the men with the bleakest life expectancy of the lot.

Nearly half of the 125,000 men in Bomber Command perished. Come peacetime, though, the bombing of German cities sat uncomfortably with the narrative of victory. There wouldn’t even be a campaign medal.

Yet, the fact remained that 55,573 families had lost a father, husband, brother or son. Where were they to lay their wreaths? Four years ago, Bee Gees singer Robin Gibb – whose family had worked in the factories which built Lancaster bombers – joined forces with a team of volunteers to make amends.

It was a long haul but they managed to raise the £6.5million required to build an appropriate monument. And very fine it is too – poignant, proud yet utterly non-triumphal. It even includes a dedication to all those who died, the bombed as well as the bombers.

When it came to this summer’s opening ceremony, the trustees received early ministerial assurances that the Government would help cover the costs of a dignified event. But they were victims of their own success.

The event ballooned into a state occasion with a huge royal, diplomatic, political and military turnout (plus all the consequent security). Applications from veterans and bereaved families were treble the original estimate.

The Bomber Command Association, while delighted by all the interest, was a little overwhelmed. Bills poured in. On the eve of the ceremony, for example, the trustees were stunned to be handed a fresh insurance demand for £50,000.

One of the organising committee managed to produce a personal cheque for £22,000 just to secure enough portable loos.

To make things worse, it would later turn out that those ministerial assurances had not been set in stone. Some, like the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, did their bit and paid up. Others did not.

The Ministry of Defence even tried to present its Lancaster Bomber flypast as payment in lieu. That was little comfort to the eight trustees – three of them veterans – this week as they found themselves liable for a £550,000 deficit.

Yes, they were not as thorough as they should have been in their financial management. But who can blame them? They were organising an unveiling, not a state occasion. They aren’t clever accountants or civil servants.

They are that great British institution without which civic society would fall part – a committee of volunteers. And they have achieved a great thing with their memorial. It would have been wholly unjust for them to be punished for it.
