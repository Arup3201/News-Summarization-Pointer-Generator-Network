A quick-thinking couple saved the life of their three-year-old neighbor as he plunged from a three-story building in California.

Konrad and Jennifer Lightner were moving furniture on Sunday night when they saw the boy throwing toys out of the window of an apartment on N. Pass Avenue in Burbank.

Fearing for the child's safety, the couple called 911 seconds before the boy crawled out of the window and became tangled in power lines.

The couple threw down their box-spring mattress and Mr Lightner caught the falling boy, using the mattress to cushion the blow.

'It feels like I watched a TV show, like it didn't happen to me,' Mr Lightner told ABC 7.

Good timing! Konrad and Jennifer Lightner (not pictured) were moving a mattress into their Burbank, California apartment when the boy fell out of a three-story window and got caught in phone lines

Mr Lightner described the incident as 'surreal'.

'It doesn’t seem like it really 
happened. You don’t really carry a box-spring with you everywhere, and it kind of worked out with us being there,' he told NBC.

'(The boy) grabbed a telephone wire and started hanging from it. After 40 seconds, he started crying because he understood he couldn’t go back to the window.

'I knew I didn’t want to go against him. I tried to slow him down enough to break his fall.'

Ms Lightner said she and her husband were overwhelmed by their incredible timing.

She had called emergency dispatchers before the boy fell and kept them abreast of what was happening before crews arrived on scene.

'We called 911 and Konrad threw the box spring down trying to break his fall and stood there to catch him,' she said.

'It
 was very surreal afterwards. We were just moving the rest of day and 
every once in a while we'd look at each other and just be like, 'That 
happened. That was real'.'

The couple told ABC 7 that, earlier in the day, they'd been stuck in an elevator for 30 minutes.

The fatalistic couple said if that didn't happen, they would not have been there at the right moment to save the little boy.

MyBurbank.com reported that the boy's parents, who were in another part of the apartment at the time, heard the commotion and ran down the stairs.

The boy's father thanked Mr Lightner for saving his son's life. Incredibly, the boy was treated for only minor injuries.

Although Mr Lightner refused to describe himself as a 'hero', emergency workers at the scene commended his quick-thinking.

'It’s one of the most wonderful things I have ever seen,' paramedic Royce Nix told NBC.

Firefighter Eric Rowley, this year’s ‘Burbank Firefighter of the Year', was also at the scene.

He awarded Mr Lightner the Burbank fire department challenge coin, the same coin that has been given to soldiers since WWI for brave acts and good deeds. 

For Mr Lightner, being in the right place, at the right time brought its own rewards.

'I'm not a hero,' he told ABC 7. 'I just walked by and just tried to help. Just something happened and were there. We were lucky to be there.'

He told NBC he will never forget the experience.

'If and when we have kids, I’ll make sure the windows are closed and locked,' he said.
