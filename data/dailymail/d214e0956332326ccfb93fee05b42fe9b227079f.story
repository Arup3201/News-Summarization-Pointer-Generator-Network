'Children's end': Nick Clegg told told the Leveson Inquiry he was 'ignored and derided' before the Lib Dems entered Government

Nick Clegg was left to sit at the 'children's end of the table' when he first met Rupert Murdoch, he told the Leveson Inquiry today.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he was 'ignored and derided' before the Liberal Democrats entered Government.

Giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into media standards, Mr Clegg revealed he questioned David Cameron on his decision to appoint Andy Coulson as his press secretary in the days after the coalition was formed.

But the Prime Minister told him that 'everyone deserves a second chance'.

The Lib Dem leader said prior to the election he was shunned by the Press and was only an observer at the dinner party in December 2009 which Rebekah Brooks also attended.

But after he performed strongly in the first televised debate in the run-up to the last general election, he said that newspapers led a 'vitriolic' campaign against him.

Mr Clegg accused the media of going after 'the man rather than the ball' to tackle the new 'yellow team' who had come to the field.

In contrast, the Liberal Democrat leader said when he became leader of the party in 2008 many senior figures did not 'know me from Adam'.

Talking about the dinner on December 
16, 2009 that he attended with Mr Murdoch, Mrs Brooks and Sunday Times 
editor John Witherow and a number of other people, Mr Clegg said he was little more than 'an 
observer'.

'I was at the very end of the table, where the children sit, so to speak,' he added.

It is unclear who else was at the dinner.

The following March he had lunch with
Sun editor Dominic Mohan, and a 'brief' meeting with Mrs Brooks and Mr 
Murdoch lasting a maximum of 10 minutes.

He had also met the media mogul's son James Murdoch twice before in April 2008 and July 2009.

The Lib Dem leader's appearance before Lord Justice Leveson meant he avoided frontbench alongside David Cameron at Prime 
Minister's questions today after he ordered his MPs not to back Jeremy 
Hunt in the House of Commons.

The Prime Minister is due to give evidence to Lord Justice Leveson himself tomorrow.

Labour will force a vote on whether 
there should be a sleaze inquiry over his handling of the Murdoch 
empire’s takeover bid for BSkyB.

Mr Clegg said Jeremy Hunt has given a 'full, good and convincing account' of his handling of the BSkyB bid.

The Deputy Prime Minister delivered 
his strongest backing yet for the Culture Secretary - despite signalling
last night that Mr Hunt should be subject to a sleaze probe.

Mr Clegg said he sought assurances from 
then cabinet secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell that News Corporation's attempt
to take full control of BSkyB would be handled properly if 
responsibility was shifted to Mr Hunt.

'I was ready to accept the reassurances,
as I did, that the process would have to be conducted in a sort of 
objective and quasi-judicial manner and that in one sense Jeremy Hunt's 
personal views were as irrelevant as Vince Cable's were,' Mr Clegg said.

Evidence: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today said newspapers played the 'man and not the ball' with attacks on him after he performed well in the first television debate before the general election. However, he defended the right of papers to be partisan

Mr Cameron has refused to call in Sir 
Alex Allan, the independent adviser on the ministerial code of conduct, 
to investigate if Mr Hunt breached the rules.

Mr Hunt has faced criticism over his office's ties with News Corporation lobbyist Fred Michel.

Tennis partner: News Corp lobbyist Fred Michel's children goes to the same school as Nick Clegg

Nick Clegg lives near Mr Michel in Putney, south-west London and has also played tennis with the lobbyist.

However, he today sought to distance himself from him and said they have barely met since the general election.

Mr Clegg told Lord Justice Leveson: 'Fred Michel and I first met each 
other many years ago well before I thought of entering British Politics 
when he was working at the time for a centre-left think tank.

'Our children go to the same school in
south-west London so I very much knew him before he was employed in his
current capacity.'

My Clegg added that he had not seen Mr Michel since November 2010.

He said: 'Since the general election 
in May 2010 my social contact with him is very very infrequent indeed 
there was one dinner we were both invited to held by someone we both 
know in Putney in September 2010.'

Nick Clegg said he questioned David Cameron about his decision to appoint Andy Coulson as his press secretary in the days after the election.

But the new Prime Minister said that the former News of the World editor 'deserves a second chance'.

Mr Clegg said that Mr Cameron was free to make his own appointments.

The Liberal Democrat leader told the inquiry: 'I said to the Prime Minister "is this the right thing to do given the controversy around Andy Coulson and my party's view on him?".'

 Nick Clegg today praised the Daily Mail for their 'outstanding' campaign to have Stephen Lawrence's killers brought to justice.

The Deputy Prime Minister said it was important that newspapers led campaigns and that politicians responded to them.

Gary
Dobson and Stephen Norris were jailed for life in January for the 
racist murder of 18-year-old A-level student Stephen Lawrence in Eltham,
south London, in April 1993.

The
Daily Mail campaigned for justice for Stephen's parents Doreen and 
Neville Lawrence, culminating in the landmark convictions.

Mr
Clegg said: 'The Daily Mail's outstanding campaign on bringing the 
murderers of Stephen Lawrence to justice was a brave campaign and 
undoubtedly justified.'

He
also praised the Guardian for pursuing phone-hacking and said it was a 
'virtue' of the British press that they launched such campaigns.

But Mr Clegg said Mr Cameron replied that he 'felt, as he put it, he deserved a second chance. A lot of the allegations we now know were not known to us then and this conversation would have been quite different.

'In a Coalition the Prime Minister has a right to make choices about who he appoints to his team which I can't, and wouldn't ever, seek to veto.'

Mr Clegg gave details of an apparent warning over the BSkyB bid which was conveyed though his then parliamentary aide Norman Lamb.

The MP had been told 'that it would be good for the Lib Dems to be open to the bid, otherwise we would expect no favourable treatment from the Murdoch press', according to the Deputy Prime Minister.

'Norman was quite agitated about that,' Mr Clegg went on. 'As we had not received particularly favourable treatment in the first place I did not think it was a particularly credible threat.'

Mr Clegg said newspapers led an at times
'vitriolic' campaign against him in the run-up to the last general 
election after he performed strongly in the first television debate 
between the three party leaders.

He said the Press had gone from being 'indifferent at best' to 'lashing out' after his ratings spiked in the polls.

'If that is what you are used to in 
the press it must come as a bit of a shock, I guess, when you suddenly 
have these people who you have been either ignoring or deriding suddenly
doing well in a general election, you start lashing out a bit and that 
is what happened,' Mr Clegg said.

However, he defended the right of newspapers to hold whatever editorial positions they want.

Asked by Robert Jay QC about a Sun 
editorial before the election which said 'vote Clegg and you will get 
Gordon Brown, he responded: 'Editorials are about expressing partial opinion and I would defend that to the death.'

Mr Clegg said his contacts with 
journalists and media executives were more formal since entering 
government, partly because he was based in Whitehall rather than 
Parliament.

Mr Clegg said his contact with national 
newspaper editors had been infrequent - although there had been a spike 
in the run-up to last year's AV referendum.

Discussing his meetings with editors and proprietors, he said he often could not remember what they talked about.

'All of these meetings are a whole lot
less intriguing and surprising, I suspect, to the outside world than it
might initially seem,' Mr Clegg insisted.

'A lot of them are fairly humdrum.'

He praised the British Press for their 'campaigning zeal' - which he contrasted with that of foreign media.

He said without the Guardian's pursuit of phone-hacking, the Leveson Inquiry would never have happened.

He
told the inquiry: 'It is one of the great virtues of our press that 
we've got the campaigning zeal in our press – I think readers like it 
and it's something we should celebrate.
