In the small lock-up garage where he helped his father run a fabrics business, Bob Galbraith never dreamed of where hard work and ambition might take him.

But there is hardly a bigger showcase for a curtains-maker than the Oval Office, where a fine example of the company's products hang behind the president's desk.

Scottish weaver Mr Galbraith, 46, began life helping his dad run the small business Calzeat & Co in Biggar, South Lanarkshire.

From modest beginnings in a garage, the company grew and hit the summit of its achievements when a call came through from Barack Obama’s interior designer.

The required wool fabric was made in just three weeks and has been hung in a number of rooms in the White House, including the famous Oval Office.

And in a further stroke of luck, Mr Obama's election means his curtains will hang on the walls of power for another four years.

The father-of-three said: 'My dad started with nothing, making ties in a lock-up garage and now we have curtains hanging in the White House.

'They were designed and developed specifically for them at the request of Michelle Obama which is really flattering, we are so proud.

'We have always prided ourselves on quality and design and hopefully that is reflected in our products. I’m very pleased the Obamas seemed to like our work.

'I have a little piece left, and you never know, I may make some cushions for myself from it one day.'

Calzeat & Co was founded in 1973 by Mr Galbraith's father Robin, 74, in a lock-up garage in Biggar, South Lanarkshire.

He built the business up and now runs shops in Biggar, Peebles, in the Borders, Stockbridge, in Edinburgh, and is planning to open a fourth in December in the capital’s Morningside area.

The company also counts celebrities Sean 
Connery, Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg, Dustin Hoffman, George 
Clooney, Mike Myers and Gerard Butler among its customers.

These accounts came via US interior design Michael Smith, who orders Mr Galbraith's fabrics for homes belonging to his famous clients.

The company, run with the help of Mr Galbraith's brothers David, 50, Kevin, 48, and Graeme, 35, employs 52 full- and part-time staff and has an annual turnover of £4million.

It also produces clothing, and created a series of contributions for last year’s Dressed to Kilt fashion show in New York.

Mr Galbraith said:  'I have met Sean Connery five or six times and I know Mike Myers really well.

'Mike used me to test his Scottish accent when making the Shrek films and when he got married he asked to make him a kilt.

'I feel really lucky that I get to travel around the world and meet all these brilliant people.'

The family’s crowning moment came in September 2010 when they received a call from Mr Smith, who became a fan nearly 10 years ago when he unwittingly began to use their fabric for various projects.

Mr Smith had been commissioned by First Lady Michelle Obama to furnish the inside of the White House, which included replacing the brown curtains hung by former President George W Bush, and wanted to use the family’s fabric.

Mr Galbraith and company designer Fiona Knight set to work and three weeks later a sample was sent to the White House for personal approval.

After being given the green light, 120 yards of the fabric was dispatched to a curtain-maker in New York for cutting in January last year

The finished design has hung in the White House ever since.

Mr Galbraith said: 'I suggested we make them out of pure wool and give it a two tone effect which, from a distance, would look like one block colour.

'I think the design works really well. They hang beautifully and really look the part.

'We made 135 yards but only shipped 120, I have kept the remaining 15 for myself.

'This is a family business, it always has been, and I really hope I can pass that legacy onto my children.'
