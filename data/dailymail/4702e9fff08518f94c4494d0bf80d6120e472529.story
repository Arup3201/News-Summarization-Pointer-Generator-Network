A startling video has emerged showing Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson unleashing another homophobic rant - just months after the TV show's network suspended him for a similar tirade.

Robertson was filmed giving an Easter Sunday sermon at Whites Ferry Road Church in his hometown of West Monroe, Louisiana on April 20, according to the video on YouTube.

In the footage, the 68-year-old expresses his anger at the outcry over his December interview in GQ magazine, in which he likened homosexuality to bestiality and branded gay people sinners.

'They were mad at me,' he tells the congregation in the video. 'You
 say, "why'd they get mad at you?" Cuz instead of 
acknowledging their sin, like you had better do, they railed against me 
for giving them the truth about their sins. Don't deceive yourselves.'

Rant: In an Easter Sunday sermon at his Louisiana church, Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson complained about the outrage against him following his homophobic comments last year

He went on: 'The news media didn’t even know it was a verse! They thought I
 was just mouthing off. "Is homosexual behavior a sin?" The guy asked me. I
 said, "Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of 
God? Don't be deceived".'

Paraphrasing a Corinthians verse, he continued: 'Neither the sexually immoral, nor the 
idolators nor adulterers nor male prostitutes, nor homosexual offenders,
 nor thieves, nor greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will
 inherit the kingdom of God.'

'That list of sins covered me in my past life,' he said. 'We've all been there. The reason we're here today is to remind us of the gospel that's preached.'

His rant is met by scattered applause and cheers from the congregation.

It comes just five months after Robertson, a born-again Christian, gave the controversial GQ interview.

Tirade: The congregation claps as he repeats that gay people - as well as thieves and cheaters - are sinners

'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine,' he said in the interview. 'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there.

'Bestiality, sleeping around with this 
woman and that woman and that woman and those men... Neither the 
adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual 
offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - 
they won't inherit the kingdom of God.'

His homophobic comments also included such insights as: 'It seems like, to me,
 a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man's anus.

'That's
 just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She's got more to 
offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: 
It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical.'

He also grouped
 homosexuals with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone 
on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job. We just love 
'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they're homosexuals, 
drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I'm 
saying?'

After the interview emerged, Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus from Duck Dynasty.

In hot water: Robertson, 68, was briefly suspended from Duck Dynasty last December following an interview

While his removal was lauded by gay rights organizations, fans of the 
show denounced it as a violation of his right to free speech.

Conservative supporters included 
Sarah Palin, who wrote in a Facebook post: 'Free speech is an endangered
 species. Those intolerants' hatin' and taking on the Duck Dynasty 
patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.'

A&E initially said his views were 'disappointing' but two weeks later, they announced that Robertson would be included when they began filming again in the new year.

'After
 discussions with the Robertson family, as well as consulting with 
numerous advocacy groups, A&E has decided to resume filming Duck 
Dynasty later this spring with the entire Robertson family,' the network
 said in a statement.

Uncertain future: Duck Dynasty (the cast is pictured) has seen lower ratings since the tirade last year

Robertson also released a public apology saying, in part: 'I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me.

'We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.'

Whether or not this latest rant will affect his position on the show - which has suffered falling ratings since the first tirade - has yet to be seen.

The show is scheduled to begin its sixth 
season on June 11.
