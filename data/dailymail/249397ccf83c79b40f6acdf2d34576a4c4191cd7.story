Football referee: Gary Connor, 40, hanged himself the day after bailiffs hounded him for money he did not believe he owed, an inquest heard

A football referee hanged himself the day after bailiffs hounded him for debts he did not believe he owed and was close to clearing, an inquest heard today.

Gary Connor, 40, was becoming 'overwhelmed' by his financial worries, and the day before his body was found he was visited by debt collectors in relation to his car.

However, at the inquest into his death doubts were raised over whether the debts amassed by Mr Connor, from Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, were as bad as he feared.

His body was discovered in a field near to his hometown on the morning of September 28 last year.

His former girlfriend, Stacey Gallagher-Hammond, told the hearing in Hatfield that the former footballer and qualified referee had seemed stressed and nervous at the time of the bailiffs' visit.

She said she thought Mr Connor was around £1,600 
in debt, but the inquest heard he may have been 
close to sorting his financial issues.

Detective Constable Steve Blackie told the hearing a PPI claim Mr Connor made should have been enough to clear his debts.

Graham Danbury, deputy coroner for Hertfordshire, recorded a verdict of suicide.

Recording
 his verdict, Mr Danbury said: 'We have had quite a bit of evidence 
about his financial affairs, which appear to have been in something of a
 mess, although the overall picture seems to be that it wasn’t as bad as
 he thought.

'On that day Gary appears to have been overwhelmed by a combination of mainly financial issues.

'This was his way out.'

The family of Mr Connor, a qualified referee and former footballer, said after the hearing that banks and companies he supposedly owned money to were not sure what cash they were due.

They described him as 'a wonderful man, kind and generous and loved by many, many people', but criticised the pressure debt collectors put on people.

'The hole left in our lives by his loss will never be filled,' the family said in a statement.

'It has been a complete shock to us that Gary felt driven to do this.

'It is clear that he was being chased for debts that he did not believe he owed.

'As his family has continued to deal with his bank and their debt management company, it has become clear that those institutions do not themselves know whether any debts are owed.

'We do not know how much this confusion and the demands affected Gary’s decision, but the stress that people are put under by financial institutions that do not understand their own demands must be immense.”

The family added that they were unhappy at the 'lack of communication and contradictory information' from police during the investigation.
