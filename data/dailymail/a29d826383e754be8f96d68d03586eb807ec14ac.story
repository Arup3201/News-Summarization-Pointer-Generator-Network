Tony Pulis is on the brink of becoming West Bromwich Albion manager after rejecting Newcastle United.

The former Stoke boss, who quit Crystal Palace on the eve of the season, is clear to work again from January 1 under his severance deal with the south London club.

He had been interested in the vacancy at Newcastle but told his advisers to end talks when they became worried that controversial club owner Mike Ashley and head scout Graham Carr would want a say in team selection.

Ashley and Carr control the recruitment of players at St James’ Park, a situation Alan Pardew reluctantly accepted. But it was a factor in Pardew’s decision to accept an offer to become Palace’s new manager.

Pulis, 56, was not prepared to accept that. Newcastle were unavailable for comment.

Indeed, Pulis insisted he would only succeed sacked head coach Alan Irvine at The Hawthorns if it was written into his contract that he would be in charge of transfers. Last season’s LMA Manager Of The Year is expected to be in charge for Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie against non-League Gateshead.

Having rejected Newcastle, a lawyer and an agent representing Pulis opened discussions with West Brom. But Pulis had given them strict instructions not to agree to a position that fitted into the current management structure of the struggling Premier League club.

Pulis had no interest in allowing a technical director to recruit his players when he prefers to trust his own judgment. It was over recruitment that he parted company with Palace in the summer and he was not prepared to compromise. It meant West Bromwich owner and chairman Jeremy Peace, who had also approached Tim Sherwood, had to rethink a structure that has Terry Burton as technical director and Richard Garlick as sporting director. Burton is essentially head of recruitment.

Pulis will be joined by his former Stoke and Palace assistant David Kemp. The appointment of Pulis suggests that Peace is ready to accept the terms of a more traditional manager.

He had little choice, given the difficulties West Brom have endured since losing Roy Hodgson and Dan Ashworth to the FA.

Pulis will become the fourth boss at The Hawthorns in a year after Steve Clarke, Pepe Mel and Irvine.
