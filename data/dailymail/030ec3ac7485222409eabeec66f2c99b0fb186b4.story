High Street hotty Primark has unveiled it plans for our spring/summer wardrobes and the fashion forecast is hot prints and icy sweet colour palettes.

Featuring a flash of futurism for the cool kids, the womenswear collection also includes waspish waists and voluminous skirts in its 'Modern Couture' story and utility-inspired tailoring that could work for, well, work.

Prints are the biggest trend of the season for the bargain brand ranging from nostalgic My 
Little Pony stamps in to heady kaleidoscope tiling.

And for accessories the heels are strappy, jewellery is dainty and pocket-front
 bags come in miniature, all painted in saccharine-sweet colours.

Primark has unveiled its Spring 2014 collection exclusively to the Mail Online and the range is defined by a sugary colour pallette, clashing prints and some f-ugly shoes

The menswear designs take inspiration
 from sportswear, featuring hi-performance fabrics and retro team 
colours. You're not expected to do any actual sport in them though, just
 look cool as you pose nonchalantly in the pub. Even the looser, more 
relaxed 'Downtown Bauhaus' story features a nod to athletics.

Prints are big news for the boys, too - are you brave enough to clash camo, animal, Batik and Hawaiian floral?

Suits have been given a revamp, including a skinnier fit - with prices starting at just £40 - and tailoring details such as polka dot pocket squares, satin lapels and contrasting buttons give a subtle nod to the heritage trend . 

Arrives in store from January 2014 in sizes 6-10. Fashion prices start at £5.
