Hull City took the unusual decision to play two pre-season friendly matches in one evening as one side travelled to North Ferriby United and the other Harrogate Town on Monday.

And the Tigers endured mixed fortunes as they comfortably saw over Harrogate 5-0 but could only draw 1-1 with North Ferriby. 

Manager Steve Bruce accompanied the team to North Ferriby where Hull left the Eon Visual Media Stadium with a draw following Shane Long's 51st-minute penalty.

New signings Tom Ince and Robert Snodgrass enjoyed their first outings in a black and orange shirt. 

Mark Gray equalised for the home side with 11 minutes remaining to deny Hull a victory, but the Tigers still retained the Billy Bly trophy.

The other Hull side left Wetherby Road as 5-0 winners, however, as they strolled to victory at their fellow Yorkshire town.

Braces from George Boyd and Robbie Brady, as well as a strike from Calaum Jahraldo-Martin, saw the Tigers win 5-0 in the town where Mark Cavendish crashed during the first stage of this year's Tour de France.

Assistant manager Steve Agnew made the step up to temporary boss for the night as he oversaw the victory at Harrogate due to Bruce's attendance at the North Ferriby game.
