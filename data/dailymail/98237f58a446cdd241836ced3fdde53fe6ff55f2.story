Our galaxy - which is around 100,000 light years wide, is thought to have 40 billion planets with potential for life.

The figure is an estimate drawn up from our current knowledge 1049 planets orbiting around other stars, with over 2000 more candidates currently awaiting follow-up observations.

Of those 1049, we know of a dozen planets around other stars with any possibility to support life as we know it.

This infographic by U.S. web comic Randall Munroe shows just over 2,000 potentially habitable planets that scientists estimate could be within 60 light years from Earth.

The
 planets in the image are in the 'habitable' or 'Goldilocks' zone, which
 is a belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water 
to pool on a planet's surface - and support life.

Mr Munroe used existing data to make a visual representation if the size and amount of potentially habitable planets.

Earth is placed in the centre of the infographic to provide a sense of scale, and all the planets are organised by approximate size.

While it doesn’t provide a sense of distance or position, the xkcd image shows that alien life may not be as far as we might think.

Mr Munroe, who is a former Nasa robotocist, created the infographic after news in November that the nearest habitable world is near enough to see with the naked eye.

The hunt is on for planets about the 
size of Earth that orbit at just the right distance from their star - in
 a region termed the habitable zone.

The
 habitable zone is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal 
for liquid water -- an essential ingredient for life as we know it -- to
 pool on a planet's surface.

To determine the location of a star's habitable zone, scientists have to first learn how much total radiation it emits.

Knowing precisely how far away a habitable zone needs to be from a star also depends on chemistry.

For
 example, molecules in a planet's atmosphere will absorb a certain 
amount of energy from starlight and radiate the rest back out.

How much of this energy is trapped can mean the difference between a turquoise sea and erupting volcanoes.

Researcher Andrew Howard said: ‘Potential sites for life to get started are abundant in the galaxy

‘We still don’t know how easily life can spring forth on a potentially habitable planet but with 40 billion chances, I’m optimistic that we’re not alone.’

The findings, detailed in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, were based on a statistical analysis of observations made by Nasa's now-crippled Kepler space telescope.

Scientists used data collected by Nasa’s Kepler telescope, which took photographs of 150,000 stars every 30 minutes for four years.

These images were then analysed for 
small but regular dips in the star’s light – a telltale sign that a 
planet is passing in front of it.

Some 42,000 of the stars monitored were like the sun or slightly cooler and these had 603 planets orbiting them.

Ten of these were Earth-like, that is,
 roughly the size of our planet and just the right distance from their 
star for it to be neither too hot or too cold for life to survive.

After
 accounting for holes in the data, they estimated that 22 per cent of 
all sun-like stars are circled by a planet that could be suitable for 
life.

‘Our galaxy has 40 billion chances for life to get started and evolve,’ said Dr Howard, of the University of Hawaii.

‘Today, more than ever we need to focus on searching for intelligent life.’
