The setting couldn't be anymore stunning, with the 26-year-old posing in front of a backdrop of crystal blue water.

On Thursday afternoon, Lara re tweeted a post from Who magazine's Twitter page.

'@MsLaraBingle is not or has not married Sam Worthington in a beach ceremony, her rep confirms to @WHOmagazine,' it read.

Lara and Sam have been inseparable over the past few months after meeting at the Cotton On Foundation's Global Citizen Concert headlined by Bono, Kings of Leon, Stevie Wonder and Alicia Keys at Central Park back in September.

As an ambassador to the brand, Lara was guest of honour, and was joined by Sam, Natalie Imbruglia and Scott Eastwood for the charity music event.

According to onlookers, 'sparks flew' between the pair during the concert, and they soon were seeing the sights of NYC and later Paris and other cities around Europe together.

Sam clearly likes to date women from his home country as he briefly dated Aussie singer and actress Sophie Monk this year, and before that was in a relationship with Australian bartender Crystal Humphries.

Meanwhile, Lara was formerly engaged to Australian Cricket Captain Michael Clarke, but she most recently dated fashion designer Gareth Moody, 35, and then New York DJ Nick Cohen.Â 

Lara is currently in Western Australia spending time with Sam while he films his new movie, Paper Planes.

The Avatar star grew up in Perth before making it big in the film industry and he spends a lot of his time these days Stateside.

It was recently announced that the 37-year-old actor will reprise his role as Jake Sully in James Cameron's long-awaited Avatar sequel.

The movie will start shooting in New Zealand next year, with a tentative release date set for 2016.

Avatar was the highest-grossing film in history and made $2.7 billion worldwide, along with winning three Academy Awards.

Cameron has already revealed he has 'an idea for a fourth' movie in the franchise and said the forthcoming motion picture will tell the story of the 'early expeditions' on the moon Pandora.

He told MTV News: 'Basically it goes back to the early expeditions of Pandora, and kind of what went wrong with the humans and the Na'vi and what that was like to be an explorer and living in that world.

Earlier this week, Lara was seen spending time on a $30m super yacht, cruising around Rottnest Island with good gal pals Emmi Moore and Nadia Rosa.
