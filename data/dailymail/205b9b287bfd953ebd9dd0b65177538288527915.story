Is he fur-eal?

NFL icon Joe Namath may have messed up the coin toss, but he nailed his fur coat at the Super Bowl XLVII in New Jersey tonight.

The football great made a fashion splash in the opening moments of the epic play-off with his pimp-esque, voluminous skin - almost identical to one he used to wear in the Seventies.

But it didn't take long before the internet took over and the 70-year-old was compared with everyone from Thriftshop-master Macklemore to Seinfeld character Kramer to...the IKEA monkey.

Huffington Post poll: Punters thought the IKEA monkey looked better in the fur coat that NFL legend, Joe Namath

Beneath his hooded shaggy outwear, the 
American football legend dressed conservatively in a white button-up 
shirt, grey sweater and black trousers.

News websites were awash with quick polls asking punters to decide who wore the coat best.

By 8.30pm, the monkey was leading Huffington Post's poll, with 66 percent, with Namath and Macklemore trailing with 18 per cent and 15 percent respectively.

The IKEA Monkey is the 
Japanese snow macaque named Darwin that was found roaming around a Canadian IKEA store in December 2012 wearing a coat. 

Namath seemed to have impressed Sean 'Diddy' Combs, as the musician shared a silly Photoshopped snap of the two saying: 'Me and the original Broadway Joe with our furs draggin!! Seahawks let's go!!!! (sic)'

Priorities: Joe Namath may have botched the coin toss, but at least he nailed the fur coat

While Namath is famous for his flamboyant style, the former New York Jets quarterback's outfit choice tonight wasn't 
appreciated by all punters. Animal lovers predictably criticized
his fur.

Sarah
 wrote on Twitter: '@RealJoeNamath, that fur coat just doesn't suit you.
 You know who it would look great on? The animals who wore it first. 
@peta.'

Mark Critch tweeted: 'I'm not a big PETA guy but I don't agree with what #JoeNamath did to Lassie.'

However, it was generally agreed that Namath stole the show with his impressive attire, despite botching the coin toss early on.

Before referee Terry McAulay had a chance to ask the Seahawks whether they wanted heads or tails, Namath flipped the coin, USA Today reported.

McAulay caught it in the air, asked the Seahawks for the call, then gave the coin back to Namath.

Tonight's wardrobe selection proves Namath is still living up to his 'Broadway Joe' moniker.

He has rocked the furs since his prime in the 1960s, with pictures of him  watching the Baltimore Colts defeat the Jet at Shea Stadium on November 14, 1971 and getting fitted by a furrier in 1968.
