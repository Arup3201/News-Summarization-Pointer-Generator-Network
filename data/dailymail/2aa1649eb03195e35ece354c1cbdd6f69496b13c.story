Tony Blair's multi-million-pound fortune has received an £80,000 boost from the will of his father Leo.

Probate records reveal that Leo, a former barrister and law lecturer who died aged 89 last November,  left a net estate worth £295,000.

His will, drawn up in 2005, left a legacy of £50,000 to his daughter Sarah, 56, who is unmarried. The rest of the estate was then divided between all three of his children, meaning Sarah, Mr Blair and their elder brother Sir William, 63, a High Court judge, each receive £80,000.

Mr Blair, 60, was very close to his father and named his youngest son after him.

The former Prime Minister is notoriously secretive about his wealth, with most of his earnings since he left office in 2007 being hidden in a network of private companies.

Mr Blair makes millions of pounds a year from advising business chiefs and governments. He is also one of the world’s highest-paid after-dinner speakers.

It was revealed just last month how Tony Blair and his wife Cherie have added house number eight to their expanding property portfolio.

Like the purchase of their seventh house, costing £1.35million in September, cash was again paid when they snapped up a £600,000 cottage for the former prime minister’s younger sister, Sarah Blair.

The pretty woodland retreat – about a mile from the Blairs’ Buckinghamshire mansion for which they paid £5.75million in 2008 – was bought on Valentine’s Day earlier this year.

Land Registry documents show it is owned jointly and ‘equally’ by Sarah and Cherie Blair.

The homes the Blairs bought for their children are also co-owned by Mrs Blair.

Mr Blair, 60, is said to be protective of his sister, who is unmarried, has no children and shuns publicity.

He has said that they and their brother Bill were all very close and that he would often turn to his siblings for emotional support.

Until recently Miss Blair lived in a £450,000 flat in Islington, North London.

The Blairs also lived in Islington until the 1997 election when they moved to No 10 and sold their home only to see it rocket in value.

Now the combined estimated value of the eight properties in their portfolio is nearly £21million.

Mr Blair reputedly earns £20million a year from government advisory work, speeches and consultancy work and has amassed a fortune of up to £60million.
