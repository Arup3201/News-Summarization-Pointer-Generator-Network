A teenage boy has been stripped naked and chained to a lamppost after allegedly trying to mug a pedestrian in Brazil.

The youngster, believed to be aged between 16 and 18, was ambushed by vigilantes in Flamengo in Rio de Janeiro.

He was stripped of his clothing, before being shackled by his neck to the lamppost with a bicycle lock.

The boy, who was also stabbed in the ear, is believed to have tried to mug a pedestrian in the street in the minutes leading up to the attack.

However, he was allegedly spotted by three men, who decided to make him pay by stealing his clothes and tying him up.

He was eventually saved after passerby Yvonne Bezerra de Melo, a local teacher and founder of the educational project, UerÍ, called the emergency services.

She told Rio-based newspaper O 
Globo: 'He was beaten, stabbed in the ear, stripped naked and tied by 
his neck - and no-one in the street did anything to help.

'I asked him who had done that and he said it was the "motorcycle vigilantes".'

Firefighters
 arrived at the scene and were forced to use cutting equipment to rescue
 the boy, who was later taken to hospital by ambulance.

Following the incident, Ms de Melo, 66, shared a photo of the teenager on her Facebook page - describing him as 'young', 'bruised' and 'naked'.

More than 150 people have since commented on the photo - many of whom claim they have 'no pity' for the boy.

Leonardo Costa posted: 'I have suffered at the hands of thieves and I couldn't care less if they are tortured or killed.

Meanwhile,
 Danillo Fernandes said: 'Wake up, you idiots. Anyone who walks around 
in Flamengo knows this is a THIEF who mugs old ladies and women every 
day on Avenue Oswaldo Cruz and adjacent streets.

'He has a gang, generally with four other thugs and two women. He deserved more.'

However, Ms de Melo condemned the vigilantes' actions - saying: 'If we let a gang of pitbulls kill and tie teenagers to lamp posts, this thing will get ugly.'

A
 spokesman for the firefighters of the Catete Quarter said: 'A man was 
tied to a lamp post on Avenue Oswaldo Cruz, corner with Avenue Rui 
Barbosa, in Flamengo.

'The victim was aided by the military police and taken to the Municipal Souza Aguiar Hospital.'

It comes as Brazilian network Rede Record reported that crime in Flamengo has risen by 200 per cent since 2012.

Seven 'delinquents' were arrested in the neighbourhood on Sunday as 
part of a crackdown, according to the command of the second BPM, or Botafogo quarter of military police.

Police have now identified the teenager and launched an investigation.
