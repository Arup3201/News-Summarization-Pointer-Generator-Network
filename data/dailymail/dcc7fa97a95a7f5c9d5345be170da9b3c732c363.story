Hazard and Lukaku are two names likely to appear in Belgium’s team to face Australia on Thursday, but they won’t be the same players so familiar to Chelsea and Everton fans.

Instead, Thorgan Hazard and Jordan Lukaku are set to feature for Marc Wilmots’ Belgium squad - the younger siblings of Eden and Romelu who are hoping to emulate the success of their older brothers.

Thorgan has already represented Belgium, coming on for a substitute in Belgium’s 4-2 victory against the USA in 2013, while Jordan will be making his debut after being called-up to the senior squad for the first time.

Both youngsters have represented Belgium at every youth level from Under 15s all the way through to Under 21s, with Thorgan making 61 appearances to Jordan’s 27 so far.

Chelsea have high hopes for 21-year-old Thorgan - who is currently on loan at German side Borussia Monchengladbach. The attacking midfielder was sent out on loan last year to Belgian side SV Zulte-Waregem, where he has impressed.

Hazard scooped the coveted Belgian Golden Shoe in January 2014, effectively a prize for the best professional player in the Belgian Pro League. The prestigious accolade was previously bestowed to the likes of Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany.

Lukaku will look to impress upon a possible debut against Australia, as the left-back is yet to be capped for the full national side. The 20-year-old signed full time this year with Belgian side Ootstende following a successful loan year spent at the club.
