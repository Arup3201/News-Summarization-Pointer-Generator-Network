Al Pacino is returning to the London stage in a play for the first time in 30 years, and vows: ‘There will be decadence!’

The Oscar-winning legend told me he will lead a full production of Oscar Wilde’s Salome in the spring of 2016.

Pacino has performed productions of Salome in Brooklyn and Los Angeles, but they were more rehearsed play readings than a full, dressed-up show.

Al Pacino said he will be leading a full production of Oscar Wilde’s Salome in the spring of 2016

‘We’ll be wearing clothes for London,’ he joked when we chatted at a splashy dinner at the Corinthia Hotel off Trafalgar Square, where the 74-year-old was being honoured with the British Film Institute’s highest honour, the BFI Fellowship.

‘There will be make-up, sets, costumes . . . and decadence. It will be a whole different thing to what we did in America,’ he promised.

‘We had Jessica Chastain play Salome in Los Angeles, and made a film of the play. It was her first film. We lucked out on her, but we need to discover a new actress to play Salome in London. We’re all looking,’ he said, referring to Salome’s director Robert Allan Ackerman and his long-time producer Robert Fox.

Pacino added that he had been ‘addicted’ to Wilde’s Salome ever since he saw Steven Berkoff in it in London back in 1989. He said he’s hoping to appear in a new play, possibly by David Mamet, in New York before doing Salome in London the year after next. ‘Otherwise, I’d be here sooner,’ he added.

Pacino starred alongside Jessica Chastain in the film version of Salome which opened on Sunday

The filmed version of Salome, starring Chastain, and Wilde Salome, an insightful documentary about Pacino’s obsession with the piece, was screened at the BFI National Film Theatre and broadcast into cinemas by Omniverse Vision last Sunday.

The films will be released on DVD/download on November 10.

Pacino appeared in Mamet’s American Buffalo at the Duke of York’s Theatre in 1984. Various attempts to get him treading the boards again failed, though he did present an Evening With Al Pacino at the London Palladium last year. That doesn’t exactly count as proper theatre, though.

The actor was at the BFI event on Wednesday with his lively romantic partner, actress Lucila Sola.

John Hurt, Joan Collins, Richard E. Grant and Ian Holm were among those who popped open a few bottles of Moet to toast Pacino at the Corinthia.

Though flutes were replenished, promptly and often, by sommeliers, there was some amusement when guests attempted to open the magnums of Moet & Chandon proudly displayed on each table — only to find they were movie prop dummies.

Even so, it was still what Pacino called a ‘classy affair’.

The Billy Boys are back in town 

Liam Mower said he was the ‘diddy’ one of the original three lads who played Billy Elliot on stage.

Now, the 22-year-old ballet dancer towers over fellow Billy, James Lomas, 24. (George Maguire was the third member of the trio, when the show first hit the Victoria Palace stage.)

All three will be taking part in a special Billy Elliot show on Sunday afternoon that will be beamed by Working Title and Universal into cinemas.

Liam will play ‘grown-up’ Billy, just for that special performance; while James, George — and 22 other actors who play played the role over the past nine years — will dance in a finale that has been choreographed by Peter Darling. Director Stephen Daldry said it was ‘phenomenal’ to see them all together. ‘They’re the extraordinary legacy of the show.’

Darling, meanwhile, said he wanted to ensure that every single actor got to show off their best skills on Sunday. ‘Some boys are at the Royal Ballet, one is a tattoo artist, one’s a movie actor, others are dancers and singers. They’re all different,’ Darling said.

Twenty-three of the Billy boys were joined by Ruthie Henshall, the show’s current leading lady, for this picture.

Watch out for... 

Olivia Vinall who was in Othello and King Lear at the National Theatre — and who’ll be back there, starring in Tom Stoppard’s new play The Hard Problem. Nicholas Hytner will direct: his final production as artistic director of the NT. The drama will run at the Dorfman Theatre in January.

Back in July, the playwright revealed the title to me, joking that it was a bit premature to say too much about it, but adding that it’s not about ‘erectile dysfunction’. However, I understand that it’s a very contemporary piece, set in some kind of thinktank organisation.

Guy Pearce, who will portray F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Dominic West, who will play Ernest Hemingway in Genius, the first film to be directed by lauded stage director Michael Grandage.

They join Colin Firth as Max Perkins, a legendary New York book editor who handled Fitzgerald, Hemingway and Thomas Wolfe. Jude Law will play Wolfe; Nicole Kidman is Wolfe’s lover Aline Bernstein, and Laura Linney plays Louise Sanders, Perkins’s wife. The screenplay for the movie, produced by Grandage and business partner James Bierman, is by John Logan.
