Everyone loves flying Virgin America according to new Consumer Reports findings.

The domestic cousin to more worldly Virgin Atlantic received some of the highest satisfaction scores the publication has seen in years on this, the company’s first appearance on the list.

The ratings were based on a survey of 16,663 Consumer Reports readers who flew on a combined 31,732 domestic flights with eleven different airlines.

Sweet ride: 16,000 consumer reports readers who flew over 30,000 domestic flights have named Virgin America the best airline in new Consumer Reports findings

The respondents were asked about their satisfaction with check-in ease, cabin-crew service, cabin cleanliness, seating comfort, baggage handling, and in-flight entertainment.

Along with JetBlue, Virgin America got flying colors in the area of in-flight entertainment. Even in coach, every Virgin America seat has its own video interface for ordering refreshments, playing games or watching movies, and even chatting with other passengers.

Those and other similar comforts were part of what won the airline the highest ranking.

No thanks: Readers named Spirit Airlines the worst

‘The leather seat cushions are so 
nice in coach,’ reader Janice Dunn told Consumer Reports. ‘There’s no 
reason to fly first class.’

The company also won fans for is 
baggage handling. Despite charging $25 each for the first and second 
checked bags, it received the top score in the category.

The
company had competition mostly from JetBlue, which lets flyers check 
one bag for free, and Southwest, which lets them check two for free.

But in all categories, Virgin America excelled.

Solid: Virgin America got high marks all around, but was boosted by its in-flight entertainment

Over 16,000 consumer reports readers were asked to rank 11 domestic American air carriers on their satisfaction with check-in ease, cabin crew service, cabin cleanliness, seating comfort, baggage handling, and in-flight entertainment. Out of a possible 100, here's how they scored:1. Virgin America, 892. Southwest Airlines, 853. JetBlue Airlines, 854. Hawaiian Airlines, 825. Alaska Airlines, 816. Frontier Airlines, 787. Delta Airlines, 788. US Airlines, 669. American Airlines, 6610. United Airlines, 6311. Spirit Airlines, 50

‘While other airlines on the list like 
Southwest and JetBlue have done a very good job of satisfying fliers,’ 
said Senior Editor Amanda Walker of Consumer Reports, ‘ Virgin America 
is a cut above in the eyes of our readers.’

At the other end of the list was discount carrier Spirit Airlines, which received the lowest marks in all categories.

The bargain airline has deeply discounted ticket prices, but makes up for them in areas like increased fees and smaller seats, which Consumer Reports responders did not seem to like.

On CBS ‘This Morning,’ Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza defended his compan’s ranking in a surprising way.

‘No
one goes into McDonald's and is surprised they don't see filet mignon 
on the menu,’ Baldanza said. ‘When they come to Spirit, they know what 
they're getting. They know they'll get a lower total price than they'll 
get anywhere else.’

Virgin
America was started in 2007 and have expanded recently. The carrier now
serves 21 cities, including Austin, Texas and Anchorage, Alaska, which 
it added this year.

Interesting technique: Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza defended his airline by comparing it to McDonalds, where your expectations should be low because so is the price
