Juventus legend Pavel Nedved believes the Italian side's Champions League last-16 match-up with Borussia Dortmund will be a 'very even tie'.

The Serie A champions will face Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund over two legs for the right to reach the quarter-finals after the draw was made on Monday.

And, although Dortmund were finalists two seasons ago, Nedved believes the draw could not have been much kinder to Juve.

The former Czech Republic international told UEFA.com: 'We have to be very careful because Dortmund have young, talented players.

'It could have been worse because there was still Bayern (Munich) and (Real) Madrid when Borussia's name came out.

'It will be a very even tie.'

Juve sit top of Serie A under the management of Massimo Allegri while Dortmund are languishing in 16th place in the Bundesliga following a dreadful start to their campaign.

And Nedved, who scored 65 goals in 324 appearances for Juve between 2001 and 2009, thinks his former side have a great chance of progressing at the expense of Klopp's men.

He continued: 'There are a few teams who are almost impossible to compete with, so we are happy to have a side against whom we have a chance.

'I'm a big fan of Jurgen Klopp and I'm curious to see our level in Europe.

'The games against Dortmund will give us a clear indication of that.'
