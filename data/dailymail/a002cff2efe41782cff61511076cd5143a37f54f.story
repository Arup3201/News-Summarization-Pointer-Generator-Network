A seven-year-old who lost both his legs to meningitis is making a splash after his parents raised £1,000 to pay for a pair of prosthetic flippers to help him swim.

Cieran Kelso was just hours from death after he 
was struck down with meningitis as a baby and despite pulling through he
 had to have both legs amputated below the knee and also lost the tips 
of most of his fingers.

He was later fitted with false legs 
and given a wheelchair to help him get around but he desperately wanted 
to swim with his friends.

So his father Gary, 34, and stepmother Gemma, 28, spent months fundraising on his behalf. They raised enough money to pay for a custom-made pair of legs that could be used in water.

Paul Leishman, at the Leeds branch of The London Prosthetics Clinic also made him a pair of flippers that attach to the ends of the feet.

Mrs Kelso, from Northwich in Cheshire, said: 'Cieran loves swimming and has been having swimming lessons for just over a year but he couldn't propel himself through the water or stay afloat as easily as everyone else.

'As soon as Cieran first wore the 
flippers it was incredible the speed he could travel through the water, 
his instructor even had to swim with him to keep up.

'We want Cieran to see that even though 
his legs were taken away by his meningitis he can still follow his 
dreams and be like his friends, just sometimes we have to make slight 
adaptations to aid him along the way.'

Cieran wears the flexible legs to play football and 
do some gymnastics and his family are planning further fundraising to pay for new pairs of legs as Cieran grows.

They also hope to one day fund a dream holiday to Florida to meet Winter the dolphin. The aquatic mammal has a stump for a tail but was recently fitted with a prosthetic one. She stars in the blockbuster movie 'Dolphin Tale' about her eventful life.

Mrs Kelso said: 'When Cieran watched Dolphin Tale, he just couldn't believe it, it's one of his favourites now.

'He obviously took a real shine to 
Winter, who has a prosthetic tale and now he dreams of hopefully one day
 meeting and swimming with her.'

When Cieran first fell ill in 2006 with a high temperature, his father, Gary, rushed him to A&E thinking he had a stomach bug.

But within hours he had been diagnosed with Meningococcal Septicaemia and was rushed to intensive care as doctors battled to save his life, and his parents were warned that he had less than three hours to live.

Champion: Cieran also wears his new legs to take part in gymnastics

Over the next few days Cieran's fingertips began to drop off as a result of the condition, and a short time later the family were told that his legs would have to be amputated. He had two operations to remove his lower legs.

After seven and half months in hospital, Cieran was allowed home. He had to learn to walk using his prosthetic legs, and also relied on a wheelchair to help get around.

But the youngster didn't let his disability slow him down; he regularly took part in sports day at school and went to gymnastics and swimming classes in the evenings, often without wearing his false legs.

He has even won medals for his sporting prowess, including a gold for a floor display and a bronze for a vault against able-bodied children.

Mrs Kelso said: 'All we want is for him to be happy and not to hate the fact that he had meningitis. To appreciate, yes that he's different, but that life goes on.'
