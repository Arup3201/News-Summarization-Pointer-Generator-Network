Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker are now fully fledged members of the QPR squad having officially been initiated by their team-mates. 

The two new central defenders were forced to sing songs during the club's pre-season tour to Germany.

Ferdinand, who joined on a free after being released by Manchester United, rapped a bit of Notorious BIG's 'Juicy'. Caulker, who signed from Cardiff in an £8million deal, sung City High's 'What would you do?'.

While 36-year-old Ferdinand seemed to thrive in the spotlight, 22-year-old Caulker seemed more reticent and uncomfortable. But Caulker did manage a whole chorus of his song while Ferdinand could only manage one line.

Using an empty water bottle as a microphone, the England pair were far from pitch perfect as they sang at an Italian restaurant in Germany.

QPR beat Rot Weiss Erfurt 1-0 on Tuesday and are next in action against Red Bull Leipzig on Saturday.

Ferdinand watched from the sidelines after doing the pre-match warm-up and the Rs wasted no time in showing the former United man what they can do.

Jack Collison, who is training with the club after being released by the Hammers, watched from the stands but remains hopeful of sorting out his future in the coming weeks.
