A 49-year-old woman stands accused of brutally abusing her 7-year-old granddaughter while dressed up as her alter ego - a witch called 'Nelda'. 

Geneva Robinson of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was arrested Tuesday on child abuse charges after taking her unnamed granddaughter to the hospital, saying she 'could not control' the girl anymore. 

Doctors reported that the girl was malnourished, and had bruises, burns and cuts all over her body. 

The girl told a Department of Human Services worker that her grandmother regularly dressed up as a witch wearing a green mask, hat and robe, to abuse her.

The face of evil: Geneva Robinson of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma stands accused of physically abusing her 7-year-old granddaughter while dressing up as her alter ego - a witch named 'Nelda' 

She says Robinson would take her to the garage and make her sleep there on a pair on pants because 'she was in trouble'. 

Robinson allegedly used a dog leash to hang the girl from the garage ceiling by the armpits, telling her 'the creatures in the attic were going to come get her'. 

The report also says Robinson burned her and hit her with an orange and black whip, and threatened to cut her with a knife.

When police searched Robinson's house, where she lives with three other children, authorities found the dog leashes and whip in the garage and the witch costume in the woman's bedroom. 

One of the boys who lives at the residence told police that Robinson once cut his finger with a pair of scissors and threatened to sever it as punishment for cutting the hair off a doll.

Another child who lives there said Robinson picked on the 7-year-old, making her eat different food and sometimes alone in the garage.

All four children who live with Robinson have been placed in the protection of DHS. Police have not said what relation the other three children had to Robinson.

An adult who also lives in the home, and wished not to be named, allegedly told police that Robinson also abused him as Nelda, and that she kicked him in the genitals on a regular basis.

But a man named Joshua, who refused to give his last name, told KFOR that he doesn't believe the allegations at all.

'It’s not true at all,' Joshua said, adding that the children who live there are troubled. 'She’s never dressed up as a witch to punish any of the kids.'

Neighbors agreed: 'It’s just something I don’t believe because I’ve seen the kids and they look fine, they look happy,' said Heidi Campbell.

Robinson was arrested on a charge of child abuse on Tuesday and booked in the Oklahoma County jail where she was held Wednesday in lieu of $10,000 bail.
