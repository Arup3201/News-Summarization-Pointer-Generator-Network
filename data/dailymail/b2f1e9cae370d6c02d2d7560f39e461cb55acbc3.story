Australian F1 driver Daniel Ricciardo has topped the leaderboard as the fastest driver in Top Gear's 'Star in a Reasonably Priced Car' challenge.

Dethroning Britain's Lewis Hamilton in the latest episode of the show, host Jeremy Clarkson said Ricciardo made the best time he's ever seen.

'That’s the fastest anybody’s ever gone around our track,' Clarkson declared during the episode.

Earlier in the week Daniel Ricciardo had already set his sights on toppling Hamilton this season - and his attempt at the famous Dunsfold Aerodrome site in Surrey was screened on February 8.

Hamilton, who clinched his second Formula One world title last year, took some beating as he is the fastest of all the F1 drivers to have taken to the makeshift circuit, ahead of the likes of Sebastian Vettel, Damon Hill, Nigel Mansell and Rubens Barrichello.

The 30-year-old Mercedes driver set his time two years ago in the car reserved for the F1 stars, a Suzuki Liana. 

Ahead of his crack at Hamilton's time, 25-year-old Australian Ricciardo said: 'It's been a while since I heard people asking 'When are you going to go on Top Gear?', so the time has come.'

Red Bull driver Ricciardo, who won three grands prix last season, added: 'I hope it's cold so the engine is crisp, but I also hope it's dry so I can actually have a good crack.

David Coulthard, a Formula One driver turned television pundit, took to the mic to ask some questions

'We'll see how we go. I believe Lewis has the crown at the moment, so it would be nice to take at least one title off him.'

Ricciardo and fellow Red Bull man Daniil Kvyat appeared at Milton Keynes' SnoZone on Tuesday, for a 'Meet the Drivers' event alongside team principal Christian Horner.

Former driver turned pundit David Coulthard was also present, as the team enjoyed the slopes on skis and sledges. 

The latest episode of Top Gear featuring Daniel Ricciardo will air tonight at Monday 9th February at 7.30pm on BBC Knowledge
