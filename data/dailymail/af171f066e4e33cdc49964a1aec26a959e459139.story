Bella the dog survived a 100ft cliff fall and then walked to the holiday home she had only been to once before as her owner searched for her.

The Labrador's incredible homing instinct saw her trudge one mile to the unfamiliar property having escaped the near life-threatening fall.

Owner Chris Sexton spent 30 minutes desperately scouring the seaside cliffs and beach for his beloved pet before his wife called to say Bella had arrived home safe and well.

Homeward bound: Bella the dog survived a 100ft cliff fall and then walked back to the holiday home she had only been to once before

The lucky Labrador's incredible homing instinct saw her trudge one mile to the unfamiliar property having escaped the death-defying tumble

The 15-month-old black dog plunged off the cliff as she chased after a seagull while out for a walk with Chris, 68, at Peveril Point, near Swanage, Dorset.

She bounced down the sloping rock face before coming to rest in one piece on the beach below.

Chris Sexton (68) from Salisbury, was out searching the cliffs for Bella when his wife Jo (68) called to say the clever dog had arrived home safe and well

Chris, a retired company director, raced down to the bottom but found no sign of Bella, who had climbed back up the cliff to begin her incredible journey.

She walked along the South West Coast Path and then made her way down several residential streets until she found the family's holiday home in Swanage.

Family friend Michael Ayling peered out of the window and saw Bella bounding down the driveway towards the block of flats.

Chris said: 'She is only 
15-months-old. I walked her down to the cliffs from the holiday home 
last summer but I would never have thought she would have remembered the
route.

'I have no idea how 
she survived the fall, got back up the cliff and then found her way back
home by herself. It is quite amazing.'

He said Bella had been well away from the cliff edge until she spotted the seagull.

He said: 'She just went for it and then went over the edge with her legs splayed out.

'I thought it was the end of her and I 
looked over the edge and thought I could see her on the beach but didn't
know if she was alive or dead.

'When I got down there, there was no sign of her. I called and whistled for her but nothing.

'After about 10 minutes I called my wife Jo who was back at the flat to tell her what had happened.

'Then I got a call back about 20 minutes later saying Bella had arrived back safely. She was fine.'

Bella's route: 1) Bella falls off the cliff at Pevril Point 2) after walking along the rocky beach she makes her way back up the cliff and along the coast path 3) Bella continues her walk back to the holiday home she had only been to once before

Chris said his wife Jo, 68, had been distraught after hearing the news but was overjoyed when Bella turned up.

Simon Williams, of Portland coastguard, said: 'The owner searched the cliffs for about 15 minutes before we were alerted.

'But the job was called off 15 minutes later when he got a message from home to say that the dog had come back of its own accord.

'It must have had a homing instinct.'
