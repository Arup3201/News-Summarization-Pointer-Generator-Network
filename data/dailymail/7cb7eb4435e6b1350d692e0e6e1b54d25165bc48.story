Killed: The American Ambassador Chris Stevens died in the attack by Al-Qaeda militants on the US Consulate in Benghazi on September 11

Officials feared the US Consulate in Benghazi was vulnerable to a 'co-ordinated attack' and had convened an 'emergency meeting' just weeks before Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in an assault by Al-Qaeda, a classified cable reveals.

Mr Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the US Mission in the Libyan city on September 11, for which Al Qaeda in North Africa and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia were implicated.

Classified cables obtained by Fox News reveal concerns expressed by the State Department's senior security officer in an emergency meeting on August 15 that the consulate could not be protected.

It also said that consular staff knew Al-Qaeda and their affiliates were running ten training camps in Benghazi and that an attack was likely.

'RSO (Regional Security Officer) expressed concerns with the ability to defend Post in the event of a coordinated attack due to limited manpower, security measures, weapons capabilities, host nation support, and the overall size of the compound,' the cable said.

The consulate's Emergency Action Committee had been briefed 'on the location of approximately ten Islamist militia and AQ (Al-Qaeda) training camps within Benghazi' and had asked the consulate in the capital Tripoli for 'additional physical security upgrades.'

The cable suggested there was no 
specific evidence that the US consulate would be attacked but warned 
that the Libyan Government was in danger of losing control in Benghazi.

It
 states: '...did not have information suggesting that these entities 
were targeting Americans but did caveat that (there was not) a complete 
picture of their intentions yet.

'RSO
 noted that the Benghazi militias have become more brazen in their 
actions and have little fear of reprisal from the (government of 
Libya).'

Gutted: Secret cables have revealed that officials based in Benghazi feared a 'co-ordinated attack' on the consulate

In a further three-page cable sent on the day he died, Mr Stevens wrote about 'growing problems with security' in Benghazi and 'growing frustration' with the security forces and Libyan police, who were 'too weak' to guarantee their security.

The US State Department said it would investigate the attack.

The revelations follow a message posted on Facebook by Navy SEALs claiming that President Obama denied them back-up as militants overran Benghazi.

The social networking site twice removed the message, which was contained in a meme suggesting Obama had relied on the SEALs when he wanted to kill Osama Bin Laden, but had denied them help when they called for it in Libya.

The message was posted by the 
Special Operations Speaks PAC (SOS), an organisation founded by Special 
Operations veterans dedicated to protecting forces at home and abroad, 
and was shared 30,000 time within 24 hours of being posted.

It
 reignited the debate over how much the administration knew about the 
circumstances of the Benghazi attack and could influence the result of 
this month's presidential election.

Astonishing claim: This message posted on Facebook suggested that President Obama denied SEALs back-up in Benghazi

Also last week, ex-Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, part of a small team at the CIA annex about a mile from the consulate, claimed he twice asked his superiors if he could go and assist the consular staff during the attack but was denied.

Sources claimed a desperate last request for military assistance made by the CIA when they were attacked was denied, even though elite counter-terrorism units were only two hours away.

Woods and two others defied the 
orders and made their way to the consulate, by this time ablaze, and 
started firing on the attackers.

Their
 presence helped an evacuation of the main building and recovered the 
body of State Department staff member Sean Smith, who had been killed in
 the initial attack.

However,
 the CIA team were unable to locate Ambassador Stevens and returned to 
their own base around midnight, where they came under attack themselves.

At
 this point, they called for assistance from Sigonella Air Base in 
Italy, two hours away, but air support was told to wait - despite the 
gun battle raging for four hours.
