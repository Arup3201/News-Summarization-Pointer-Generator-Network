Israel denied deliberately targeting hospitals in the region as rockets continued to blast the Gaza Strip on the second day of fighting since the collapse of the three-day ceasefire yesterday.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government said that it started targeting 'terror sites across the Gaza Strip' in response to Hamas rockets fired in the early hours of Friday - shortly before the ceasefire collapsed at 6am UK time.

Meanwhile, the White House joined the UN 
in condemning the collapse of the truce, which ended in the deaths of 
five Palestinians, including a 10-year-old boy.

Israel launched more than 30 aerial attacks in Gaza on Saturday, while Palestinian militants fired rockets at Israel as the conflict entered a second month - defying international efforts to negotiate an agreement for an extended ceasefire.

The renewed fighting shattered a brief calm in 
the month-long war which has claimed more than 1,960 lives, and dealt a 
blow to Egyptian-led efforts to secure a long-term cease-fire between 
the territories.

The Israeli government's comments come as the White House joined the UN in condemning the collapse of the truce.

The White House urged Israel and the Palestinians to do what they could to preserve civilians after having failed to extend their ceasefire. Spokesman John Earnest said on Friday 'the United States is very concerned' about the renewed violence.

While U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon 
expressed 'deep disappointment' at the failure to extend the cease-fire 
and urged the parties to swiftly find a way back to the negotiating 
table, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said.

Earlier,
 Amnesty International claimed it has evidence that Israel's military 
forces have specifically targeted hospitals, health workers and 
ambulance personnel during the conflict.

Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told Sky News: 'We don't target hospitals, we don't target civilians.'

He
 added: 'What we've had to do on a number of occasions is to hit 
terrorist targets in the immediate vicinity of hospitals and things like
 that, where they've abused them.

Hamas
 are deliberately abusing humanitarian structures and using them to 
shoot their rockets at Israel, he continued, and said that they should 
be 'held accountable' for their actions.

He said Hamas 'threw away the chance' to extend the ceasefire and Israel waited six hours before striking back.

Today Palestinians gathered to retrieve bodies from the rubble of al-Qassam mosque in Gaza, where three people - including senior Hamas official Moaaz Zaid - were killed in an air strike on Friday.

Elsewhere, residents returned to bomb-hit homes to see the devastation caused by the more than 30 rockets fired at the Gaza Strip since Friday morning.

Hamas have fired more than 65 rockets at Israel, 
military officials said, with one injuring two Israelis on Friday.

Meanwhile, the UK, which has already contributed 
over Â£17 million to help those affected by the conflict in Gaza, has deployed a world-class team of NHS staff directly to the region within the next 48 hours 
to help treat hundreds of those affected by the crisis.

Announcing the decision today, Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'The
 conflict in Gaza has taken a terrible toll. The UK has been at the 
forefront of humanitarian efforts to help those affected and it is right
 that we see what more we can do.

'The NHS has always stepped up to the 
plate to help those in need and this expert team will play a crucial 
role in helping hundreds caught up in this conflict.

'The initial team
 will be made up of a combination of doctors, nurses, surgeons, 
anaesthetists and paramedics from the specialties of emergency medicine,
 orthopaedic trauma surgery and plastic surgery.

'The medics will 
co-ordinate with local health authorities, charities, the UN and Red 
Crescent, and other international medical teams. Medics will also 
explore whether there is need for them to assist elsewhere in the 
region.'

Palestinian families fled their 
bombed-out homes yesterday morning as Israel claimed Hamas fired at 
least 18 rockets from Gaza shortly after the end of the tense ceasefire.

A
 ten-year-old boy is believed to be among three Palestinians killed in 
an airstrike near a mosque in Gaza City on Friday, in which five other 
children were injured, health officials have said.

Palestinians were killed when their motorcycle was struck, according to a
 senior Palestinian official.

A
 rocket that hit the Sdot Negev regional council of Israel injured a 
civilian and a soldier, according to a tweet from the Israeli military. 
It took to the social network to declare that it had struck 33 sites in 
Gaza, though it did not specify where they were, while six rockets had 
hit southern Israel. The military said that more 
than 70 rockets have been fired from Gaza since the end of the 
ceasefire.

Israeli tanks also fired into northern Gaza and Israeli gunboats targeted the central area of the strip, according to reports.

Tensions
 have also been growing in the West Bank where protesters have clashed 
with Israeli troops. Reports say two Palestinians have been shot dead, 
one on Friday and one on Saturday.

A
 Palestinian man died of a bullet wound during a confrontation with 
Israeli soldiers in the city of Hebron, health officials said on 
Saturday.

More
 than 1,900 Gazans have been killed in the war, roughly three-quarters 
of them civilians, according to Palestinian and United Nations 
officials. At least 429 of those killed are understood to have been 
children.

The Israeli military took to Twitter to say that they had struck 33 targets in the Gaza Strip since midnight after the truce collapsed yesterday morning

Israel 
disputes that breakdown, saying more militants have been killed. 
Sixty-seven people have been killed on the Israeli side, including three
 civilians from rocket fire.

The
 war grew out of the killing of three Israeli teens in the West Bank in 
June. Israel blamed the killings on Hamas and launched a massive arrest 
campaign, rounding up hundreds of its members in the West Bank, as Hamas
 and other militants unleashed rocket fire from Gaza.

On
 July 8, Israel launched an air campaign on the coastal territory, 
sending in ground troops nine days later to target rocket launchers and 
cross-border tunnels built by Hamas for attacks inside Israel. Gaza 
militants have fired more than 3,000 rockets into Israel.

Hamas,
 which violently seized control of Gaza in 2007, rejected several 
cease-fire offers throughout the fighting. Its primary demand is the 
lifting of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after they seized power.
 Militants had warned they would resume fighting after the cease-fire 
expired unless there was a deal to ease the restrictions.

The
 blockade, which Israel says is needed to prevent weapons from reaching 
Gaza, has led to widespread hardship. Movement in and out of Gaza is 
limited, and the economy has ground to a standstill and unemployment is 
over 50 percent.

Israel has said that the militants must disarm first, a demand dismissed by Hamas.

Hamas entered the Cairo talks from a position of military weakness, as Israel has said Hamas has lost hundreds of fighters, two-thirds of its rocket arsenal and all of its tunnels under the border with Israel during the war. Egypt also has destroyed a network of smuggling tunnels that was once Hamas' economic and military lifeline.

A delegation of Palestinian negotiators remained in Cairo in hopes of salvaging the talks. But participants said the negotiations were not going well. The Palestinian delegation met again late Friday with Egyptian mediators.

Azzam al-Ahmad, head of the Palestinian delegation, said the delegation would stay in Egypt until it reaches an agreement that 'ensures' the rights of the Palestinian people. 'We told Egyptians we are staying,' he told reporters.

The Israeli delegation to the Cairo talks left Egypt on Friday morning, and it was not clear if it would return. 'There will not be negotiations under fire,' Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said.

Egypt's Foreign Ministry urged restraint by both sides and called for a new cease-fire to resume negotiations. The ministry said progress had been made in the talks but did not explain.
