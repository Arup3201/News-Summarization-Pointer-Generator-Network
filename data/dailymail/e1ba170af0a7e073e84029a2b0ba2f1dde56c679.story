An auction of memorabilia belonging to prison-bound former 
congressman Jesse Jackson Jr has been halted over concerns about the authenticity of one of the items.

The auction got underway on Tuesday, but concerns were later raised about a guitar, said to be signed by Michael Jackson and Eddie Van Halen.

The online auction by the U.S. Marshals Service is an attempt to 
recoup part of the $750,000 in campaign funds the disgraced Chicago Democrat and 
his wife illegally spent.

Pricey: U.S. marshals were selling prize possession of Jesse Jackson Jr and his wife Sandi after they were sentenced to jail for spending campaign money on personal purchases. The items included these bright capes

Court: Former Illinois Rep Jesse Jackson Jr and his wife, Sandra, leave their August sentencing hearing in Washington after both were jailed for misusing $750,000 in campaign money

Fame: The auction includes celebrity memorabilia like a framed and autographed Michael Jackson cymbal, as well as Bruce Lee poster

Fake? Authorities are suspicious of a guitar supposedly signed by Michael Jackson and Eddie Van Halen

'After receiving legitimate concerns 
about the authenticity of the guitar purportedly signed by Michael 
Jackson and Eddie Van Halen and out of an abundance of caution, the 
Marshals Service will conduct a secondary review of all the assets,' the
Marshals Service said on Friday.

Once the lots have been investigated the service will decide whether the items will be sent for auction again, according to CBS News.

In
addition to the guitar, other Michael Jackson memorabilia and multiple 
fur coats were among a dozen items being auctioned off to help pay off a
$750,000 money judgment against Jackson.

He
and his wife were handed prison terms last month. The couple now have 
to witness some of their prize possessions being sold off to the highest
bidder. Get your bids in at txauction.com.

A lady's red cashmere cape with black mink fur trim drew the most early action as 
bidding started at 10am Tuesday - attracting 16 bids within 15 
minutes. The highest offer by lunchtime was $615.

Other ostentatious clothing includes a lady's black sheared mink jacket with 40 per cent silver fox sleeves and a long black sheared mink hooded parka.

All of the fur items come with a sales receipt from Edwards Lowell Furs in Beverley Hills from November 14, 2009. This must have been a particularly expensive day in the Jackson household.

Before the auction started, the highest minimum bid set by the 
auction house was $350 for a Bruce Lee autograph.

But within 15 minutes,
not a single person had bid for it. Later in the day it got one minimum bid.

Also in the collectibles section are a Michael Jackson-autographed Zildjian ZBT Splash 10' cymbal as well as a number of signed posters and photos by Jackson and Bruce Lee.

The objects up for auction illustrate the disgraced legislator's passion for both pop iconography and for what some might consider gaudy and pricey fashion.

Prosecutors said Jackson spent tens of thousands of dollars other apparent frivolities, including two mounted elk heads for his office. Those were not listed among the objects on sale this week.

Collectible: This framed Michael Jackson poster had received 13 bids a few hours after the auction opened
