The family of a filmmaker linked to an anti-Islamic movie has left their California home in the middle of the night to join the man in hiding.

A
spokesman with the LA County Sheriff's Department said that Nakoula
Basseley Nakoula's relatives, each with his or her face covered, left their Cerritos home about 3:45am on 
Monday.

Deputies gave them a ride and they were reunited with Nakoula, 
then taken to an undisclosed location.

Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the LA County Sheriff's Department, told ABC News: 'They decided they would be safer where they could move about and live a normal life.

'All we did was pick them up and reunite them with Mr. Nakoula.'

He would not say when or if Nakoula and his family were planning to return - if ever.

He told ABC: 'What we do know and what they told me is that for the time now and for the immediate future, for the weeks and months to come, they will not be returning to this address.'

Nakoula
wore heavy apparel to disguise his appearance when he left his home 
over the weekend.

His family was no different, keeping their faces covered as they were led away by deputies.

Meanwhile, as fresh protests broke out in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Iranian Vice-President Mohammad Reza Rahimi issued an stark message directed at Nakoula.

'The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran condemns... this inappropriate and offensive action,' Mr Rahimi said.

'Certainly it will search for, track and pursue this guilty person who... has insulted 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide.'

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also issued a statement, calling on the West to show it respects Islam by blocking the film.

'They must prove they were not 'accomplices' in a 'big crime', he said.

Nakoula was interviewed by federal probation officers, who 
are reviewing a 2010 case in which he was convicted of bank fraud.

Federal
authorities have identified Nakoula, a self-described Coptic Christian,  as the key figure behind 'Innocence
of Muslims,' a film denigrating Islam that ignited violence against 
U.S. embassies in the Middle East.

Nakoula later admitted that he produced the film with the help of his 21-year-old son, Abanob Basseley.

The 14-minute clip on YouTube has sparked violence across the Muslim world.

Violence began Tuesday when 
mainly Islamist protesters climbed the U.S. Embassy walls in the 
Egyptian capital of Cairo and tore down the American flag from a pole in
the courtyard.

Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to 
Libya, also was killed on Tuesday along with three other Americans, as 
violent protesters stormed the consulate in Benghazi.

A federal law enforcement official told The Associated 
Press on Thursday that authorities had connected Nakoula to a man using 
the pseudonym of Sam Bacile who claimed earlier to be writer and 
director of the film.

Nakoula pleaded no contest in 2010 to 
federal bank fraud charges in California and was ordered to pay more 
than $790,000 in restitution.

He was also sentenced to 21 months in 
federal prison and was ordered not to use computers or the Internet for 
five years without approval from his probation officer.

His attorney cited Nakoula's poor 
health in a bid for leniency and home detention, stating his client 
suffered from Hepatitis C, diabetes that require twice-daily insulin 
shots, and other ailments that required more than 10 medications a day, 
according to a transcript of the sentencing obtained by the AP.

Many records in case remain sealed, 
but prosecutors sought a longer prison term and noted that he misused 
some of his own relatives' identities to open 600 fraudulent credit 
accounts.

Nakoula apologized during the proceedings and his attorney 
James D. Henderson Sr. said Nakoula had learned his lesson.

'He's clearly gotten the message,' 
Henderson said. 'I can't imagine him doing anything stupider than what 
he did here, but what's done is done.'

Henderson said during the hearing that
his client had been enlisted by another man to open the accounts and 
had only received $60,000 to $70,000 from the fraudulent transactions.

He got involved in the scheme after losing his job in the gas station 
industry and had been forced to work for a few dollars a weekend at swap
meets to try to support his children and an ailing father, Henderson 
said, according to the transcript.

It could be difficult to establish a 
probation violation case against Nakoula. In the federal court system, 
the conditions of supervised release are geared toward the offense for 
which a defendant was found guilty and imprisoned.

In Nakoula's case, the offense was 
bank fraud. His no contest plea was to charges of setting up fraudulent 
bank accounts using stolen identities and Social Security numbers, 
depositing checks from those accounts into other phony accounts and then
withdrawing the illicit funds from ATM machines.

While it was unclear what might have 
provoked authorities' interest, the filmmaker's use of a false identity 
and his access to the Internet through computers could be at issue, 
according to experts in cyber law and the federal probation system.

Nakoula, who told the AP that he was logistics manager for the film, was
under requirements to provide authorities with records of all his bank 
and business accounts.

The probation order authorized in June
2010 warned Nakoula against using false identities.

Nakoula was told 
not to 'use, for any purpose or in any manner, any name other than 
his/her true legal name or names without the prior written approval of 
the Probation Officer.'

Federal prosecutors had charged that 
Nakoula used multiple false identities in creating his fraudulent 
accounts.

Several, Nicola Bacily and Erwin Salameh, were similar to the 
Sam Bacile pseudonym used to set up the YouTube account for the 
anti-Islamic film.

Other pseudonyms used in the accounts ranged from 
Ahmed Hamdy to P.J. Tobacco.

Nakoula was also told he could not 
have any access to the Internet 'without the prior approval of the 
probation officer.'

Nakoula was ordered to detail any online devices and
cellphones to authorities and was told his devices would be monitored 
and subject to searches.

Jennifer Granick, a criminal defense 
lawyer who specializes in online crimes, said authorities might not have
been aware of Nakoula's online activity even if monitoring devices were
placed on his computers. 'That may be very hard for a probation officer
to catch ahead of time.'

Granick also noted that Nakoula's 
conviction for financial crimes might provide a basis for probation 
officials to review bank and other monetary records.

'Somebody charged 
with a financial crime might receive some supervision categories where 
they might re-offend,' she said.

Nakoula was arrested in June 2009, 
pleaded no contest to the bank fraud charges a year later and was 
released from federal prison in June 2011 after serving a 21-month 
prison term, according to federal records.
