A teenage girl's ashes were tossed into the street by thieves after they found them in her mother's truck.

The ashes of Emma Ransom had been kept in a velvet pouch by her mother since the 19-year-old's death in 2009.

Culprits apparently tipped the ashes out of the pouch onto the pavement when they found them in a truck during a series of vehicle break-ins in Calgary, Canada, on August 2.

Precious: Emma Ransom, 19, was killed in a car crash in 2009 - since then her mother had kept her ashes close to her in a velvet bag

A green jacket 
that belonged to Emma was also taken.

Emma was killed along with two other women when the car they were driving in 2009 near Nanton, Alberta, slammed into an oncoming car.

Ransom was barely able to hold back tears yesterday as she discussed losing her daughter for a second time.

'The first thing I looked for were my daughter's ashes, and they were gone,' she said.

'The policeman found the little pouch in the middle of the road and it was empty, so we went down to the corner and found the pile of ashes there.

Grief: Colleen Ransom tried to salvage as many of her daughter's ashes as she could from the rain-soaked street

Robbed: Thieves found the bag containing the ashes in Mrs Ransom's truck

Spree: Several other vehicles were stolen from the area of Calgary on the same day

'It had been raining, they were wet and we couldn't scoop them.

'We got a few anyways.'

Ransom, who tightly clasped a large picture of her smiling daughter, said she always kept her close by.

'Anybody who has lost someone knows how precious it can be. They were the only things I have left of my daughter and I like her to come with me wherever I go,' she said.

'I thought, who would do that? Who would take the ashes and dump them? And then I realised they probably didn't know they were my daughter's ashes.'

The few remaining ashes are now safely in her home. Ransom said in future she plans to take her daughter's ashes with her, but will keep them in her purse.

Ransom said the pain of the loss of her daughter hasn't eased over the past four years.

'It never goes away. She's always there. I wake up â€¦ I think about her. I think about her constantly.'

Mourning: Colleen Ransom held her daughter's picture and the ashes she had retrieved as she spoke to the public

Plea: Police and Emma's mother are still looking for a green jacket, which was also stolen with the truck

Calgary police are looking for three teenage girls who were spotted in the neighbourhood.

All three were very petite and one of them might be named Sarah, police said. One was blond, one had brown hair and the third had black hair.

'It's hard for me to even imagine suffering the loss of a daughter and, of course, to have this happen again,' said acting Staff Sergeant Lee Stanton.

'And now, unfortunately, our victim has been victimized once again, so we're looking for the public's help to find those responsible for that.'

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.
