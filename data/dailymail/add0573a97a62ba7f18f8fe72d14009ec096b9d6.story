A gold medal-winning Paralympian had his medal hopes at London 2012 ruined when he was knocked down by a hit and run driver while training, a court heard today.

Double gold medallist Simon Richardson MBE, 44, was training on a dual carriageway in Bridgend, South Wales, when he was knocked off his cycle by a driver allegedly twice over the drink-drive limit.

Mr Richardson was training hard to qualify for the 2012 London games, but his bike was destroyed and he suffered life-threatening spinal and lower body injuries which ruled him out of competition.

Farmer Edward Adams, 60, is accused of hitting Mr Richardson while more than double the drink-drive limit - and driving with chronically bad eye-sight.

A jury heard today that Adams should not have been driving because his judgement was 'severely impaired'.

Prosecutor Jane Rowley told Newport Crown Court today: 'Mr Adams simply drove through him. He collided into the rear of his bicycle with the passenger side of his van.

'Mr Richardson and the bicycle were thrown into the air and he travelled 26m before landing on the grass verge.

'His specialised Beijing Paralympics bike was broken into pieces due to the force of the impact and Mr Richardson suffered serious life threatening injuries.

'Mr Adam’s driving was more than simply careless, it was dangerous and incompetent.'

Mr Richardson, of Porthcawl, South Wales, suffered fractures to his spine, sternum and pelvis and was left with deep lacerations to his leg and a perforated bowel.

Richardson, who won two golds and a silver at the Beijing 2008 Paralympics, had hoped for more glory but is now ruled out of the competition

Adams, pictured arriving at a court hearing last year, was allegedly twice over the drink-drive limit and had 'severely impaired judgement'

He received an MBE after winning two golds and one silver medal at Beijing in 2008.

Mr Richardson was in training for the London Paralympics and had clocked up 250 miles on the country roads near his home.

He was 20 miles into his training ride when he was hit from behind by the passing van.

But he was left lying on the grass verge as Adams drove away from the scene of the crash and tried to hide the van at his farm near Cowbridge, South Wales.

The court heard even with his driving glasses on he could not read a number plate from four metres away - and could only partially read one from two metres.

Motorist Gordon Broomfield drove past the cyclist before witnessing the crash in his rear view mirror.

He said: 'The visibility was very good and I had no trouble seeing the cyclist from a distance away on the very straight road and passing him.

'When I looked back I saw the white van coming closer to the cyclist.

'I kept waiting to see when it would move out of the way but it just kept on going. He drove through him.

'I was just in disbelief that this all happened.'

Mr Broomfield gave police the registration number of the white Peugeot van he had seen as it drove away.

Miss Rowley said the van was found later by police helicopter flying over Adams’ farm.

Officers landed nearby - and found Adams in his house with a tumbler of whisky and was double the drink-drive limit.

Adams initially denied any knowledge of the crash in August last year - but later admitted he was behind the wheel.

Adams told police he was bilnded by the glare from the sun and thought he had 'hit a sheep'.

He said: 'There was a bang and I thought: 'Oh my God I have hit a sheep'. But then I thought 'Oh well there are a lot of them around' and so I carried on.

'When I got home I had a couple of whiskys to calm myself down because I was shaking. I didn’t realise I had hit a person. I am very sorry I hit someone.'

Adams, of Pentre Meyrick, Vale of Glamorgan, denies one charge of dangerous driving.

He has admitted drink-driving and failing to stop after an accident.

The trial at Newport Crown Court continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
