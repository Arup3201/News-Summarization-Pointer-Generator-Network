A three-year-old cancer patient has been raising thousands of dollars for a cancer research charity with her colorful hand-painted Mother's Day cards.

Aubrey Castro, from San Dimas, California, who has been battling Type 2 Leukemia since last May. She hopes that her artistic talents can help benefit the 175,000 kids like her who are diagnosed with childhood cancer every year around the world.

'She already is such an artist. She does the flower in one stroke,' her mother, Vanessa Castro, tells ABC News, adding that her daughter paints three flowers on each card, one for every year of her life.

Aubrey was rushed to hospital last year when doctors discovered a high temperature in her stomach. After running tests, she went into surgery and the very next day, started on a course of chemotherapy.

'Ever since she’s been going through treatment, she’ll paint or color with crayons or makers,' Mrs Castro explains. 'Even when she was at home and on steroids. She had an easel, it was painting and coloring… that’s how the cards evolved.'

Aubrey, whose favorite colors are pink 
and purple, wants to be an artist when she grows up and she seems well 
on her way; her family have already sold over 1,500 cards, and Aubrey 
wants to sell 2,014 by Mother's Day.

The card materials have been donated by a local printing company, and the cards are being sold of the St. Baldrick's Foundation's website - a charity which raises money for childhood cancer research - and on a friend's Etsy store for $5 a piece.

'I wanted Aubrey to just know that we've been so blessed in this journey, and that she, as a little three-year-old, can make a huge impact,' her mother says.

'She's the little girl her parents had prayed for, who loves to dance, sing, paint and write,' reads the website set up in her name. 'She loves her big brother, the two of them are best friends always taking care of one another.'

Aubrey is responding well to her 
chemotherapy and hopes to be finished in July of next year. In an act of
 solidarity with her daughter, who lost her beautiful brown locks as a 
result of her treatment, Mrs Castro is planning to shave her own head 
for the same charity.

Along with 46 other volunteers - the number of children diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. each weekday - the devoted mother will travel to Boston for the 'Mommas Shave for the Brave' event - despite little Aubrey's reservations.

One little gesture of using your talents in painting can just spiral into something phenomenal

The adorable three-year-old apparently hasn't 'warmed up' to the idea and has said she doesn't want her mother to lose her hair.

If their target of 2,014 cards is reached by Mother's Day, the family will raise $10,000 dollars for the Baldrick's Foundation, and if not, Mrs Castro says they will keep selling them anyway.

'One little gesture of using your talents in painting can just spiral into something phenomenal,' she concludes. 'So that's why we're doing it.'
