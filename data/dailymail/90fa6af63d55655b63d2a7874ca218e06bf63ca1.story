A judge has chastised himself for not doing ‘his public duty’ after sparing a burglar jail – only for the thief to break into another house just 11 days later.

Judge Scott Wolstenholme bemoaned his own ‘foolishly optimistic’ decision to give Steffan Jackson, 18, who had burgled his father’s home, a final chance.

The teenager, whose own mother has had to call the police about him in the past, was given a community order.

But less than two weeks later he burgled another house, this time belonging to an 87-year-old man.

It is not the first time that Judge 
Wolstenholme’s ‘lenient’ sentencing has caused controversy. One man 
spared jail for a stabbing went on to murder four people.

Yesterday the judge admitted Jackson’s second victim had suffered directly because of his decision.

 ‘I was optimistic and, as it turns out, foolishly optimistic,’ he said.

‘Because of my optimism I am afraid 
[the victim] has suffered a huge loss which he wouldn’t have had I have 
been doing my public duty last time.’ He has now sent Jackson to a young
offenders’ institution for four years after Leeds Crown Court heard how
his elderly victim now felt anxious and afraid living on his own.

Last night, Jackson’s mother said she felt for the victim.  

Teresa McDarby, 52, said: ‘Steffan had
a lot of court appearances and that was the first time he was given a 
chance – but he messed it up.

‘I’m not going to defend my kids if 
they do wrong, and I do feel for the victim. Steffan is no angel. I 
agreed with the judge when he gave him that chance. However, he blew 
it.’

Jackson targeted the elderly man’s 
house in Leeds early on April 1 this year. He was subject to a curfew 
after being given a 12-month community order for the previous burglary.

The court heard the teenager, who has 
been committing offences since he was 11, smashed a window to get in and
stole more than £1,000 in cash.

He was caught by police after he cut himself and left blood at the scene, later pleading guilty to burglary.

The judge said he had not been doing his public duty when he had seen Jackson at Leeds Crown Court earlier

A statement read to the court on the 
victim’s behalf said: ‘I find it terrible somebody could come into my 
home and steal [my money] and spend it because I worked hard in my 
younger days to save. I am sure it will take a long time to feel 100 per
cent safe again. If ever I do.’  John Bachelor, mitigating, said many 
of Jackson’s offences were linked to drug abuse.

Jackson has been in trouble with the 
police from an early age and boasts on his Bebo page he likes to ‘smoke,
drink and have fun’. He also uploaded a picture of himself to Facebook 
brandishing a sword.

When he was just ten, he featured in 
the BBC3 series Honey We’re Killing The Kids, saying he had been smoking
since the age of four. His mother, who herself smoked 60 a day, blamed 
her son’s five-a-day habit on peer pressure.

The show revealed he and sister 
Shannon, now 19, had problems since their father walked out, lacking 
discipline and gorging on fast food.

His mother said Steffan was the 
youngest of her five children and she had called the police about him in
the past after he kept emptying the TV meter.  

Judge Wolstenholme attracted 
controversy in 2010 when he told two women who ran a brothel which raked
in almost £500,000 that it was a ‘model’ for how such a business should
be run if it were ever legal.

In 2005, he was criticised over his 
‘lenient’ sentencing of murderer Mark Hobson, who was spared jail for 
stabbing a man and went on to kill his girlfriend Claire Sanderson her 
twin sister, Diane, and an elderly couple James and Joan Britton.

The Brittons’ daughter, Catherine 
Wilkins, said her parents might be alive if Hobson had been jailed 
instead of being given a community service and a probation order.
