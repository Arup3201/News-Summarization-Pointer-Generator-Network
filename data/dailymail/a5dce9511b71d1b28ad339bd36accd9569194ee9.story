A group of thugs who were involved in a shopping centre brawl which led to the death of a 24-year-old man have been jailed.

Five men from rival gangs in Walthamstow and Stratford were sentenced for their part in a running battle at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, east London, which broke out when a yoghurt pot was thrown.

The violent exchange ended in the death of Liam Woodards who was stabbed in the chest.

Riaz Anderson, 19, and Tristian Mullings, 21, from one gang were both jailed for 20 months, while Danny Caton, 24, Michael Ndefo, 22, and Rhys Regisford, 21, all from the rival gang were jailed for 34 months, 28 months and 16 months respectively for violent disorder.

The Old Bailey heard that terrified shoppers fled and shops closed their shutters when trouble broke out on June 29 last year at the then-newly opened centre which is next to the Olympic Park.

The fighting started when Caton threw a yoghurt pot at a rival gang member.

Mr Woodard, who celebrated his birthday just a day before he was killed, was stabbed, steel chairs were thrown and at least three knives were brandished by gang members including Anderson and Ndefo.

The gangs continued to do battle when Mr Woodard collapsed. As one gang fled, three of the men, Caton, Ndefo and Regisford, seeking revenge for Mr Woodards's stabbing chased them to Stratford underground station where one rival was stabbed in the shoulder and another was hit with a belt.

The attackers men fled when they spotted a PCSO coming up a nearby escalator.

The whole incident, just weeks before last summer's Olympics, was caught on CCTV.

The court heard that 45 minutes before the murder of Mr Woodard, Anderson and Mullings had been threatening and intimidating three other youths in the mall.

Then the duo with four others saw the rival gang consisting of at least eight others, including Mr Woodard, and witnesses described how the two gangs became increasingly hostile to each other.

Drinks glasses and the yoghurt pots were then hurled at each other which sparked the mass brawl.

Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said: ‘This was a frightening event for members of the public who were obviously around at the time, simply trying to shop and enjoy themselves at such a venue shortly before the London Olympics was due to begin.’

Sentencing them, Judge Stephen Kramer QC said: 'Those who engage in this kind of needless, mindless and potentially dangerous violence in public must expect to receive a custodial sentence.

'Westfield Shopping Centre in Straford in east London was busy with members of the public, normally going about their business, That normality was shattered by what happened in about two-and-a-half minutes.

'Such was the intensity the area where it was happening emptied of members of the public and shops shut their doors.

'The confrontation between the members of the two groups appears to be a turf war.'

He told Caton, Ndefo and Regisford: 'Each of you lost a friend that day.

'That was upsetting for you but although it may explain it does not excuse the violent behaviour in which each you engaged.'

Anderson, who was given a warning when he was found with a knife at school aged 14, and Mullings were jailed for 20 months each for their part in the violence. They had no other convictions.

Caton was given 24 months for his role in the incident, but, because he was in breach of a suspended sentence for aggravated burglary, must serve 34 months behind bars.

Ndefo who used a knife to stab a rival in the shoulder was given 28 months behind bars. He had previous convictions for ABH, criminal damage and affray.

Regisford, who wanted to become a fitness instructor and only joined in the violence at the Underground station using a belt as his weapon, was given 16 months. He had previous convictions for having a knife, assault and theft.
