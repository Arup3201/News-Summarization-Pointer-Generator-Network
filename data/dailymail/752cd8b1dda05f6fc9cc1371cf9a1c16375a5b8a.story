Patrick Loughrey recieved a £866,000 payoff from the BBC before moving into another public-sector job

A former executive  who left the BBC with an £866,000 settlement has found another highly paid public sector job.

Patrick Loughrey, 57, was given 12 months’ salary ‘in lieu of notice’ even though the former ‘nations and regions’ boss had agreed his exit 14 months earlier and worked out his notice period.

The payment – which the Government spending watchdog said was ‘inconsistent’ with  Corporation policy – included a £266,288 ‘pension augmentation’ as part of his ‘early retirement’.

Mr Loughrey, who in April 2010 started a £200,000-a-year job as the taxpayer-funded Warden of Goldsmiths University, joined the BBC in 1984 as an education producer and left in 2009. 

He told the Daily Mail any  severance payments were ‘made in fulfilment of long standing entitlements’ and ‘approved at the highest level’.

On Monday, a National Audit Office report sparked a furious row as years of BBC pay-offs were revealed. In all, it handed staff £369million over eight years, the watchdog said.

MPs said the massive sum showed an ‘outrageous disregard for licence fee payers’ money’.

The National Audit Office said the BBC often breached its own guidelines and had ‘put public trust at risk’ by authorising the payouts, including £61million to senior managers.

Mr Loughrey said that he was unable to discuss his payment. 

In a carefully worded statement this week, he said: ‘As you will be aware from yesterday’s National Audit Office report, certain staff names were anonymised by the BBC to comply with data protection law.

Loughrey took up a £200,000 a year job as warden at Goldsmith's University

‘You will also know from the Report that there are clauses in their employment contracts which prohibit those individuals from disclosing details about their severance payments. 

‘Given this, I consider I am unable to respond to the specific questions you have raised.

‘I would however like to make clear that any severance payments I received . . . were made in fulfilment of long-standing contractual entitlements and approved at the highest level.’ The former teacher took early retirement from his role as director of nations and regions in December 2009. 

Loughrey's generous pay deal reportedly came after discussions with then director general, Mark Thompson

He had responsibility for BBC Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and English Regions and led 6,500 staff, with a £300,000 salary, an expense account and pension contributions.

Mr Loughrey was referred to by the National Audit Office as ‘Case Study 1’. It said his generous pay deal came after discussions with then director general, Mark Thompson, and deputy director general, Mark Byford.

It added the BBC ‘offered to work closely with the manager with early planning for moving to a career outside the BBC’. 

He secured a year’s pay for redundancy, as well as a year’s pay ‘in lieu of notice’.

The report observed: ‘This case provides an example of a departing senior manager receiving their maximum pay in lieu of notice (£300,000) despite the fact that they worked their notice.’

The NAO report showed Mr Loughrey had found ‘alternative employment’ before leaving.

The report said the executive’s final salary was £300,000. The BBC’s website archive also shows that Mr Loughrey was paid £300,000 when he left.

Irish-born Mr Loughrey, who lives in Kew, south-west London, is now paid £206,000 a year by Goldsmiths University.

He did not deny the suggestion that he was the recipient of the £866,000 deal, but stuck to his carefully worded statement.
