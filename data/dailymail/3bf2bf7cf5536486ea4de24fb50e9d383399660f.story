Bakary Sako is wanted by Tony Pulis as the West Bromwich Albion head coach considers a bold move for the Wolverhampton Wanderers winger.

Pulis is determined to add pace and width to his team and the 26-year-old fits the bill having scored seven goals in 27 games for West Brom’s arch rivals this season.

Sako only has six months left on his contract and Kenny Jackett has spoken about potentially doing a deal if a large enough bid comes in from a Premier League club.

Wolves want ideally to keep hold of one of their best performers and would rather let him leave in the summer for free – aiding their Championship promotion campaign in the process – than sell him now for less than their valuation.

West Brom have tabled two bids for Callum McManaman, the latest being around the £4million mark, and the Wigan winger remains a primary target. But Pulis revealed the club has ‘irons in the fire’ and Sako matches this description.

Sako is currently away with Mali at the Africa Cup of Nations, playing in the 1-1 draw with Cameroon, and has a final group match this coming Wednesday. Wolves paid £2.5million for Sako in August 2012 and rejected a bid of £4m from Nottingham Forest in August 2013. West Brom were also interested that summer.

The path to cross the Black Country divide is clearly fraught – the animosity between the two clubs is fierce – but Pulis is desperate for reinforcements this window to strengthen his fight against relegation.

West Brom are also interested in Matt Phillips at Queens Park Rangers, and had a £2m bid for Nottingham Forest’s Michail Antonio turned down this week.

Pulis said on Thursday: 'I'll be hoping to bring players in and the club is hoping we can bring players in so we will be working very hard over the next 10 days.

'The chairman will ask me if it’s value for money or not but I don’t get involved in the wages. We’ve an interest in McManaman along with one or two others.

Tony Pulis claims he has got 'other irons in the fire' if his bid for McManaman cannot be completed

'If it’s not McManaman we’ve got other irons in the fire. Like a lot of things, you’d love things to drop into place straight away, but it’s often not that way.' Jackett said on Thursday: 'We've had some transparency with Sako. We’ve said, "look, if a Premier League club comes in for you, we’ll speak to you". And because of that, we’ve got the best out of him.

'We haven’t had a bid and we don’t want one but if a Premier League club makes the right offer, we’d speak to the player. We wouldn’t accept a bid lower than our valuation.

'We paid £2.5m for him, but there’s no desperation to sell him. (Owner) Steve Morgan and (chief executive) Jez Moxey would love him to see the season out and then talk in the summer. Sako is relaxed about the situation.' -ends
