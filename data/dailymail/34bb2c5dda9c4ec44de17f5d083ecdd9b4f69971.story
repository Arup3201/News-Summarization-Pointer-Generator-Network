The killers behind a sickening triple murder which shocked America are being locked up for 22 hours a day and segregated from each other as they await lethal injection.

Details have emerged of the conditions in which murderers Joshua
Komisarjevsky and Steven Hayes are being kept in as the pair await execution in a tough penitentiary.

The notorious killers are being 
detained at Connecticut's Northern Correctional Institution in Someras 
and, while they are only two of 11 inmates in the death penalty section 
of the prison, they have no direct contact with one another.

Komisarjevsky and Hayes tortured and murdered Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, in a horrific home invasion.

The only person to survive the 2007 attack was husband and father, Dr William Petit, who was beaten, tied
up and taken to the basement. He managed to escape and hop, roll and crawl across a yard to a neighbour's house for help.

They are both now on death row, awaiting execution.

In an interview with Radar Online,
Brian Garnett, the facility's director of external affairs, revealed 
how death row prisoners spend 22 hours a day in their cells with two 
hours of recreation.

He also said those awaiting execution
are segregate unlike other prisoners who are permitted to socialise by 
playing sports and board games.

Garnett told Radar Online:
'We keep them separate for safety and security reasons after instances 
in the past where there were very serious assaults between death row 
inmates.'

Victims: Hayes was convicted in 2010 raping and strangling Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, before tying her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11, to their beds and setting the house on fire. Father and husband, William Petit, was the only survivor in the horrific 2007 attack

While they are banned from conversing face to face, inmate are able to communicate through cell doors or through ventilations shafts, Garnett added.

Garnett told Radar Online: 'They talk to staff so it’s not a situation where they don’t have communication with the folks around them.'

The inmates spend much of their time in 8ft by 12ft personal cells.

Mental health specialists meet with them three times a week and they are also allowed a once-weekly meeting with a chaplain, two 15-minute phone calls a day as well as unlimited professional visits with their attorneys.

The 11 inmates currently 
on death row at the facility will be the last to face execution since 
capital punishment was abolished in the state.

Despite the change in law, the inmates - who range in age from 20s to 60s - will still face execution.

Garnett added: 'They are still eligible for the death penalty but no one going forward will be.

'We have had one execution in 2005 
and the last one prior to that was in 1960. The one in 2005 was the 
result of the inmate giving up his appeal and volunteering.'

Both killers are due to be killed by lethal injection.

Earlier this year it emerged that Steven Hayes came up with a bizarre plan to end his own life by lying about other victims.

Hayes wrote letters bragging about how he had killed 17 other victims and raped dozens of women.

However, he later claimed in an interview that he had 'made it all up' and that he had hoped the letters would lead
prison authorities to notify police and he could trade information for 
food.

He planned to use the ploy to eat oysters in his cell to which he is deathly allergic.

The four letters that Hayes now says 
were made up as part of a bizarre suicide plot described in chilling 
detail how in two of the attacks he had tied up, tortured and killed 
women.

In the 17 pages of handwritten 
letters, which were confiscated by prison authorities, Hayes gleefully 
recounted the rape and murder of his first victim in 1982 and his 
eighth.

He wrote that all of his victims were aged between 14 and 25.

Now Hayes says the killings, 
rapes and torture documented in the letters were all lies.
