Oprah Winfrey is turning to a Downton Abbey style drama in a bid to save her ailing TV network.

The chat show queen has commissioned Tyler Perry to produce an hour-long drama called The Haves and Have Nots which strongly echoes the hit PBS series.

Perry’s show will supposedly ‘focus on the dynamics and secrets of the wealthy Cryer family and of the family of their maid, Hanna.’

Struggling: Oprah Winfrey speaks at a press event for her OWN TV network. She has since admitted the company is 'bleeding money' and has now commissioned six new shows in attempt to boost the network

It is based on the play he wrote of the same name which has already toured the US to critical and commercial success.

Commissioning Perry is part of an attempt by Winfrey to remake OWN after it failed to take off and lost her a reported $330m.

In one interview she even admitted that she might have to shut down her beloved O Magazine because she is ‘bleeding money’.

Whilst The Haves and the Have Nots is an upstairs downstairs drama like Downton, which has just begun its third season on PBS, there are a number of differences.

Downtown is set in England in the 
early 20th Century, whilst The Haves is set in the modern day and is 
about a black family in the US.

According to the play’s website it is a ‘powerful story of love and honor told with honesty and brutal truth’. The Chicago Tribune has described it as ‘another romp through the melodrama of African-American life’.

Blazing a trail: The Downtown Abbey series has been a huge hit for PBS. Now Oprah Winfrey is looking to a similar show to boost her struggling network

It said: ‘The proverbial Joneses are 
preoccupied with their superficial priorities, until they have to take a
look at life on the other side of the tracks. Powerhouse songs and 
slapstick comedy round out things.’

The other shows OWN will work on will be another Perry project called Love Thy Neighbour, a sitcom set in a diner, and a documentary called Blackboard Wars about a struggling school in New Orleans.

Raising Whitney will be a about a comedian bringing up a baby whilst Dogfellas is the working title for a show about a retired gangster who becomes a dog groomer. Golden Sisters will be about three pensioners who run a hair salon.

Erik Logan, president of OWN, told the Wall St Journal: ‘It's exciting for us. It's our first step into scripted programming.’

OWN launched in January 2011 but has been such a struggle that Winfrey has said in hindsight she might not have bothered at all.

After its blockbuster opening week which saw one million people tune in, ratings tumbled and sank to 300,000 in prime time and 150,000 in the day.

Oprah was forced to lay off 150 members of staff and personally decided to cancel Rosie O’Donnell’s nightly talk show, The Rosie Show, because of poor viewing figures.

Chief executive Christina Norman and another senior boss stepped down and Oprah herself was forced to assume overall control.

In an interview in August 2011 Oprah admitted OWN was ‘not where I want it to be’ and that it had to get better.

She also begged audiences to wait before making their minds up and asked for a grace period - of three whole years.

Things appear to have been finally turning around more recently and average audiences increased to 328,000 in December last year, a rise of 28 per cent on the year before.

That however is well below rivals like Bravo which regularly gets 900,000 viewers or Lifetime which draws in one million.

Adding to her woes, Winfrey, 58, recently revealed that she had a breast cancer scare in front of a group of 5,000 devotees at O Magazine’s annual conference in Los Angeles.
