A freshman basketball player with rare brain cancer who made it through full season despite being given only a few months to live is now having problems swallowing as her condition worsens.

During her senior year of high school, Lauren Hill was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 per cent.

But she still made it through a full season at the Cincinnati university while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor she has.

Made It: Lauren Hill, 19 (pictured), made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life

Her mother Lisa updates her followers on her Facebook page about her daughter's progress and said this week that Lauren was having trouble swallowing, although her humor and bravery are shining through. 

She posted: 'Lauren sleeps about 12 hours a day and still does not like to take naps.

'Her appetite is not as big as it use to be. She has been having increased issues with swallowing. We had to add some thickener to her water to make it easier to swallow. Food we cut down into bite sizes these days to prevent chocking.'

She said her daughter's pain medication has been increased to help her deal with headaches and aches across her body.

She added: 'She still has a sense of humor even if her legs give out and she falls. My favorite quote of the week.... "I didn't fall, I gracefully assaulted the floor." Got to love her.' 

Despite the diagnosis, Hill decided to attend college and play for the Division III school. 

In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. 

She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups.

As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. 

The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena.

The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 — a date that matches Hill's uniform number — but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. 

Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.

So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together.

'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said.

The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. 

The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet.

In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' 

Life: Doctors didn't expect Hill (center at hospital) to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain
