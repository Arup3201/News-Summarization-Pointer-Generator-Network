A seal takes an unexpected detour into a divers shark cage in South Africa during this dramatic video which also features a great white shark and two startled divers.

The divers are seen filming and monitoring a great white shark from their cage during the 25 second video when a seal suddenly passes by the cage unexpectedly. 

One of the divers shouts, 'There's a seal' and as he shouts and points towards the marine mammal the seal swims through the iron bars and enters the cage.

The two startled divers then have to jump to avoid the seal as it swims towards them in the cage.

One of the divers can be heard gasping as he just manages to raise his legs out of the way of the seal's head during this extraordinary video.

There is further drama when the seal gets stuck in the cage and one of the diver's has to gently nudge the seal through the iron bars with his foot. 

Seals are known to be an important source of prey for great white sharks.
