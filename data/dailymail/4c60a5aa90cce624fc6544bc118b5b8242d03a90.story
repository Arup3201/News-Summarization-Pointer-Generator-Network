Heartbroken: Danielle Deaver is fighting against the abortion law which left her no option but to give birth at 22 weeks to a baby girl who died just fifteen minutes later

Nebraska’s new abortion law forced one woman to give birth to her terminally ill, premature baby who she then helplessly held dying in her arms.

Danielle Deaver gave birth to one pound, ten ounce Elizabeth last December and could do nothing but hold and comfort the baby with her husband, Robb, as the newborn struggled to breath and died fifteen agonizing minutes later.

Deaver rushed to hospital when her 
waters broke at only 22 weeks into the pregnancy but doctors told the couple that
 their baby had almost no chance of surviving.

They
 explained that a lack of fluid would cause muscle tissues to shorten, 
affecting the baby's developing lungs. They would likely never develop 
beyond the 22-week point and the baby would not be able to breathe.

With this heartbreaking information the couple decided to have an abortion to avoid the baby going through any pain.

However a new law in Nebraska, the 
only one of its kind in America, bars abortion at 20 weeks except in 
specific situations when the mother’s life is in immediate danger.

The
 Deavers did not qualify and were not allowed to have an abortion. 
Instead they were sent home where they had to wait for ten days knowing 
that when their baby arrived she had no chance of surviving.

After
 the days of waiting Deaver gave birth to Elizabeth and held her as she 
struggled for breath and died fifteen minutes later.

Now the couple, who had wanted a sibling for their son, are fighting against the law to try and prevent anyone going through the same ordeal.

Agony: Banned from having an abortion the couple waited for ten agonizing days before Danielle could give birth to their baby who they already knew would not survive

The law, which took effect last October, is based on the disputed argument that a baby’s nerves are developed enough to feel pain at the 20 week stage.

In a letter urging Governor Jan Brewer to veto the bill which which bans abortions after 20 weeks Danielle Deaver,34, of Grand Island, described the pain of waiting to give birth to a baby she knew would die.

'While we waited, we tried to pray, but we didn't know what to pray for.  So we spent our days and nights telling our daughter how much we loved her, how sorry we were, and how we wished we could do something different.

'There are no words for how awful the 10 days were from the moment my water broke to the day my daughter died. There are no words for the heart break that cut deeper every time she moved inside of me for those 10 days,' she wrote. 

Ruth Nash, 34, was pregnant with twins when her waters broke 18 weeks early.

She was told her babies had a zero chance of survival and soon after lost her daughter Matilda.

However, the mother from the Isle of Wight managed to delay giving birth to her son Stanley for three weeks by lying with her feet elevated in a hospital bed.

Her precious son was born at just over 24weeks weighing a tiny 1lb - less than a bag of sugar.

Surgeons performed several operations on Stanley including fixing a hole in his heart.

Six months later, Stanley is healthy and showing no signs of his traumatic birth.

The standard of viability, based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, is generally considered to be between 22 and 24 weeks.

'The outcome of my pregnancy, that choice was made by God. I feel like how to handle the end of my pregnancy, that choice should have been mine, and it wasn't because of a law,' Deaver told The Register.

And the couple believe that the new law doesn’t take into account individual circumstances like their own.

Julie Schmit-Albin, who heads Nebraska Right to Life, believes the tragic outcome was still better than an abortion.

'We acknowledge the tragedy that occurs with a poor prenatal diagnosis for the baby. But isn't it more humane for the baby to die in a loving manner with comfort care and in the arms of her parents than by the intentional painful death through abortion?'

Deaver believes that such a decision should belong to her and her husband.

'It was very frustrating and added to our grief because the waiting compounded everything,' she said.
