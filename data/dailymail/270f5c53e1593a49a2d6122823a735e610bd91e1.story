China has seized the largest haul of gangland weaponry in its history - a cache of arms including tens of thousands of sniper rifles, machine guns, crossbows... even samurai swords.

Following a four-month investigation that led undercover agents deep into the heart of the country's criminal underworld, investigators blew open a gun-and-blade-trafficking network that has fuelled gang wars and terrorism across 30 of China's provinces.

The massive seizure, in the southwestern province of Guizhou,  includes 10,500 illegal guns and 120,000 forbidden knives - all destined for the country's flourishing underground arms trade.

firearms were arrested, state media said.

The gang's distribution network covered Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan and 27 other provinces, CCTV said.

Gun attacks are rare in China but the government has stepped up efforts against violent crime following a spate of incidents, including a knife attack at a station in Kunming city in March blamed on homegrown Islamist militants from the western region of Xinjiang that left 33 people dead and 143 injured.

It is believed that more than 10 people took part in the attack. Four were shot by armed police and four have been arrested.

Big business: An official said the illegal arms ring was a family-run business, adding that the suspects even 'gave out their business cards all over China'

Dissident fears: China's leadership is highly sensitive to issues of unrest from separatists in Xinjiang to dissidents organising through social media networks

Last month, police shot dead a man who went on a rampage with a knife killing five people after a dispute between market vendors got out of control.

China's leadership is highly sensitive to issues of unrest from separatists in Xinjiang to dissidents organising through social media networks.

Du Chuang, a public security official from Guiyang, told China Daily newspaper that the illegal arms ring was a family-run business, adding that the suspects even 'gave out their business cards all over China.'

China does not disclose statistics on organised crime, although public security officials have acknowledged that this is a 'huge-occurrence period'.

Since the opening up of the economy there has been a rise in drug use, prostitution, counterfeiting, smuggling and intimidation. Many gangs are in league with officials but, with no independent judiciary or media in the one-party state, there are few channels to expose their activities.
