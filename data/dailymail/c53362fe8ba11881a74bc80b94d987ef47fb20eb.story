Barcelona ran out 2-1 winners against bitter rivals Real Madrid on Sunday night to move four points clear at the top of La Liga.

Rik Sharma rates the players from both sides after an action-packed 90 minutes at the Nou Camp.

BARCELONA

Claudio Bravo 8: Made two excellent saves, one from Cristiano Ronaldo's first-half piledriver, the second from a deflected Karim Benzema strike near the end. No chance with Ronaldo's goal.

Dani Alves 6: Some shocking defending at times, but as we've come to expect, the Brazilian knows how to contribute in attack. His wonderful ball created Barcelona's second goal.

Gerard Pique 9: This was a performance from the defender which some believed was beyond him after his fall from grace. Got his head to every ball when it mattered and executed some perfect tackles.

After his impressive performance, Pique left the stadium with his pop star girlfriend Shakira

Jeremy Mathieu 8.5: When the Frenchman was signed it turned a few heads. He used his own to send Barcelona 1-0 up and defended expertly after that. One scary moment, when he nodded inches wide of his own goal.

Jordi Alba 6.5: Restrained himself going forward for the most part, but coped perfectly well with Gareth Bale down the wing. Fired a late chance wide after good work by Lionel Messi.

Javier Mascherano 7: Tried to copy Sergio Busquets’ style of play, instead of rushing around in his usual bulldog style. Some unnecessary play-acting aside, a fine performance.

Ivan Rakitic 6.5: Not an indelible presence in this Barcelona side, but a useful one. The Croatian helped shuttle the ball forwards to the attackers nicely, but could have offered more with Barcelona under the cosh in the first half.

Andres Iniesta 7: Captained Barcelona for the first time against Madrid and put in a mature display. Showed he can be a tough customer when he needs to be in a midfield battle, too.

Lionel Messi 7.5: Nutmegged Toni Kroos early on, and set up Mathieu’s goal with a wicked free kick. Dropped out of the game for a while, but was running the show by the end.

Lionel Messi set up Barcelona's opener and was a constant menace despite not being at his very best

Luis Suarez 8.5: Fought hard up front, in a long running battle with Pepe. Got the goal he deserved with a brilliant piece of control and an instinctive finish.

Neymar 6: Missed a golden chance in the first half, after which Madrid broke away and equalised. Some phenomenal dribbles, which terrified Madrid’s back line, but was too selfish – and wasteful - with his chances.

Sergio Busquets 6: Brought on for Rakitic as Luis Enrique tried to shut up shop.

Xavi 6: Replaced Iniesta, coming on in what could be his final Clasico. Little time to make an impact.

Rafinha 6: Gave Barcelona a safer look, with Neymar making way.

REAL MADRID

Iker Casillas 6: No errors, which was his main concern after his shocking performance against Schalke. Both Barcelona goals were impossible to keep out.

Dani Carvajal 6: Booked and was lucky not to be sent off when he tangled with Neymar. Otherwise a solid performance.

Pepe 4: Booked for going through the back of Suarez, and done for pace by the Uruguayan for the second goal. Not his finest night, and it ended early when Ancelotti hooked him for Raphael Varane.

Sergio Ramos 5: Caught out when Mathieu escaped his clutches and headed home the opener. Was too slow to react to Suarez for Barcelona’s second.

Marcelo 7.5: The Brazilian was a lively attacking outlet down the left, combining with Benzema to set up Ronaldo, when he hit the bar.

Toni Kroos 6.5: A strong first half, helping Madrid dominate proceedings. However, the midfielder has been tired in recent weeks and that took its toll in the second period, when he was quiet.

Luka Modric 7: After a three-month injury lay-off, he’s slotted straight back into the side and it looks like he's never been away. A classy customer who can hold his head high despite the defeat, playing a key role in Ronaldo’s goal.

Isco 6: The Madrid press claim he’s a national treasure, and he’s been Real Madrid’s best player in recent weeks. However, he was quiet here, and outshone by Iniesta, the man he’s tipped to replace in Spain’s side.

Gareth Bale 5.5: The Welshman nearly had the goal he dreamed of scoring, but his close-range effort was ruled out for Ronaldo being offside in the build-up. This was his chance to prove his doubters wrong, but was often on the fringes of the game, which won't ease the pressure on his back.

Gareth Bale had a goal ruled out for offside and was something of a spectator for large parts of the game

Karim Benzema 8.5: Out of the six forwards, Benzema has the lowest X factor. However, he was arguably the most effective here, setting up Ronaldo with an impudent back-heel.

Cristiano Ronaldo 7: Barcelona’s supporters whistled and screamed at him every time he touched the ball… but he’s used to that from the Bernabeu. Scored, as he tends to do, with a poacher’s finish.

Raphael Varane 7: Came on for Pepe to steady the ship and made a good tackle on Messi in the box.

Jese 6: Too little time to make an impact.
