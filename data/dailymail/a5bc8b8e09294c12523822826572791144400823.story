This shocking photo shows the girlfriend of a drug dealer boastfully rolling around in a pile of £20 notes - just before she was caught by police for her part in the lucrative business.

Victoria Murphy, from Manchester, posed for a photo with thousands of pounds worth of illegal drugs money which her boyfriend had made through his cocaine-dealing trade. 

Minesh Patel, 30, and his brother Rakesh, 34, ran the 'professional' enterprise from a corner shop in New Moston, Manchester, where they hid £120,000 worth of drugs under the counter.

business to pay her rent, posed for a photo as she rolled around in 
thousands of pounds worth of £20 and £10 notes

They also stashed cutting agents - which are used to dilute illicit drugs - in a Haribo sweet box.

The brothers even offered their customers a drug mail order service - described by the judge as the 'hallmark of professionalism' - which involved sending bundles of cocaine through the post after customers paid via bank transfer.

Murphy used some of the cash to pay her rent and was convicted for concealing criminal proceeds after the shop which fronted the high-purity drug business was raided in October last year by police.

Meanwhile, the brothers were jailed for a collective 11 years for masterminding the illegal set-up.

Manchester Crown Court was told how police found cocaine stashed behind 
the counter, while a Haribo sweets drum found in the cellar was stuffed 
with the anaesthetic Lidocaine, which is used to mix the drugs.

Another 1kg of cocaine was found buried under a child's bunkbed when Minesh's home in Blackley was raided.

During the hearing, Rakesh, from Ashton, admitted
possessing cannabis and being concerned in the supply of cocaine. He was jailed for five years.

Minesh admitted possessing cocaine with intent to supply and was jailed for six years.

Caroline Smith, defending Minesh, said: 'Having worked hard over the years to build up the family business he found himself struggling financially.

The pair kept cocaine under the counter at the shop and cutting agents - a chemical 
used to dilute illicit drugs - in a Haribo sweet box at the newsagents

'He needed to alleviate the debts 
arising out of his drug misuse. He was buying cocaine so frequently it 
led him into contact with dealers - he saw what he thought was an easy 
way to make a profit.'

Police found two years of texts linked to drug dealing on Rakesh's phone.

Nikki Gatto, defending Rakesh, said he originally turned a blind eye to his brother's dealing and then got 'sucked in' himself.

She said: 'It's quite clear Rakesh's involvement at each level was much reduced.'

Judge Richard Mansell said: 'A hallmark of the professionalism of this enterprise is that you would supply drugs by post - an increasingly popular method. You were using the shop as a cover.'
