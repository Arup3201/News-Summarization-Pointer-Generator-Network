Two parents were arrested last week after boarding their son's school bus to confront his alleged bullies while threatening to 'kick the kids' a****'

Since the beginning of this school year, Christina and Christopher Gring of North Wales, Pennsylvania say their 8-year-old son was the target of bullying. When he came home crying one day, they were only trying to get answers.

But the school district says that they were never told about the bullying and that the Grings shouldn't have taken matters into their own hands by getting on the bus - and police agree. Both parents were charged after getting on the bus and yelling obscenities at the children, making some of them cry and others hide under their seats in fear.

Taking matters into their own hands: Christina (left) and Christopher Gring (right) were arrested last week after boarding their 8-year-old son's school bus to confront his alleged bullies

Target? The Grings say their son has been picked on by other kids since the beginning of the year but a school investigation found no evidence of bullying

According to the police affidavit, Christina Gring flagged down the bus after it dropped off her son and the driver stopped thinking that her son must have left something on board.

But instead, Christina and her husband Christoper got on the bus. While Christoper stood on the steps of the bus, Christina walked to the back of the bus yelling 'Who made my son cry?'

The criminal complaint says both Grings yelled obscenities at the children and the bus driver and that Christina even threatened to 'kick the children's a**** if they continued to pick on her son.'

Many of the children on the bus were terrified and went home crying. Some hid underneath their seats during the parents' rampage.

Before leaving the bus Christopher yelled: 'My kid can beat any of you guys.'

After making bail, Christina Gring gave a different account of what happened that afternoon to NBC Philadelphia.

Claim of innocence: After making bail, Christina Gring said she was allowed on the bus by the driver who told her to ask the student safety monitors about her son's crying

She says she flagged down the bus and asked the driver why her son was crying and he told her to talk to the student safety monitors.

'I wanted to know what happened' she said. 'When the bus driver told me to ask the kids, why wouldn't I ask them?'

Christina insists that she and her husband did not threaten the kids.

'We're not monsters,' she said. 'We didn't mean to scare kids. We love our child just like anybody else loves their child.'

She believes that they were arrested as scapegoats for the district and bus driver who failed to confront her child's bullies.

'I think it's because my husband has a record and they needed someone to take the fall for this, because the district wasn't doing what they were supposed to be doing and the bus driver wasn't doing what he was supposed to be doing,' Christina said.

All together: It appears that the couple have three children total, according to a family photo posted on Facebook

The school district says that no complaints were filed on the child's behalf. After the bus incident, they conducted an investigation and found 'no reports of bullying'.

'Under no circumstances does NPSD ever want a parent boarding a bus or taking matters into their own hands.

But some parents who had children on the bus think that arresting the Grings was overzealous.

'Maybe they went a little overboard with getting on the bus but I don't think they should have been arrested,' Ian Quinn told Fox 29.

Howard Henderson's granddaughter Shaniece was on the bus and he's known Christopher for a long time.

'He should have done it in a mature way but I do believe as a parent he was sticking up for his kids. Anybody would stick up for this kids,' Mr Henderson said.

Both Grings have been charged with unauthorized school bus entry, making terroristic threats, recklessly endangering another person and disorderly conduct as well as summary harassment.

Bail was set at $10,000 each. Christina Gring made bail but Christopher is still in jail. They have a preliminary hearing set for November 5.Â
