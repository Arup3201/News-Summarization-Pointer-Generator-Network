New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal was welcomed with a floral tribute in the town centre.

The mural was made up of 25,000 tulips shipped in from Van Gaal's native Holland and measured 18ft by 12ft.

The artwork was commissioned by bookmaker William Hill and was on show in the Cathedral Gardens of the National Football Museum.

Van Gaal, who led Holland to a third-place finish at the World Cup earlier this month, began the work of restoring United's fortunes on Wednesday.

The deposed Premier League champions could only muster seventh in the top flight last season under the beleaguered David Moyes.

Van Gaal is due to give his first press conference at 3pm on Thursday ahead of the club's first pre-season friendly against LA Galaxy a week later.
