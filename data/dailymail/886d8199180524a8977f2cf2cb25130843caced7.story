Danny Welbeck will no doubt have taken to the Emirates pitch on Saturday with ideas of making former boss Louis van Gaal eat his words as the young striker made his Arsenal debut against Manchester City.

The Dutch boss allowed the English striker to leave Old Trafford for £16million on transfer deadline day before labelling Welbeck as not up to United's 'standard' but the Gunners faithful will disagree after Saturday's performance.

The 23-year-old striker may not have been able to find the net, but his energy and movement helped Arsenal to a 2-2 draw in north London.

Welbeck began brightly, working the channels and managing to keep both Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis busy during the early stages.

The game was barely 10 minutes old before Welbeck ran off the shoulder of Demichelis and haired down on Joe Hart's goal with a debut goal in his sights.

As 60,000 Arsenal fans jumped to their feet in anticipation, Welbeck sent a deft chip over Hart's head and agonosingly onto the City post.

It would have been a memorable opener and the Arsenal fans applauded, but they will all have been wishing the former United striker just put his foot through the ball.

It's a trait that seemed to anger United legend Paul Scholes, who couldn't understand why Welbeck went for such a showboat finish.

Scholes told BT Sport: 'When the big chance comes he didn't take it. I think it's to do with ruthlessness

‘It's the part of the game he needs to improve. He's not a Ruud Van Nistelrooy he's not an Andy Cole they would have put them away no doubt. He [Ian Wright] would have put that away.’

However, Welbeck didn't let the first half miss play on his mind as he covered ground and made space for the onrushing Arsenal midfield.

The former Sunderland loanee looked to be thriving in his favoured role and it was his tackle on City defender Vincent Kompany that eventually led to Wilshere's equalising goal. 

Welbeck did brilliantly to rob Kompany of the ball before releasing allowing the Gunners counter-attack which culminated in a brilliant Wilshere leveller.

The former Manchester United striker was unlucky not to open his Arsenal account

Shortly afterwards as Arsenal attacked down the right, Welbeck's slight nudge on Kompany inside the City penalty area put the big Belgian off his stride which caused him to miss-time his header and give Wilshere the ball.

Wislhere headed to the back into the City box and former Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez needed little invitation to strike towards goal and put Arsenal into a 2-1 lead after 74 minutes. 

With the score at 2-2, Arsene Wenger brought Welbeck off after 87 minutes to a standing ovation from the Gunners faithful.

He may not have hit Van Gaal's high 'standard' just yet, but seemingly already settled in an Arsenal shirt, that 'standard' doesn't seem too far away.
