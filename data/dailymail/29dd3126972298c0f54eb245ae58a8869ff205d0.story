At the age of 20, I was going to have to spend the rest of my whole life 
looking like Albert Steptoe. Or at least that's what I told myself on 
the day a dentist grabbed my cracked front tooth, tore it out without 
warning and gave me a denture.

For the past 18 years I've lived with a plastic plate on the roof of my mouth and an utter fear of visiting the dentist.

I've
 wanted to lose the false tooth and the fear - but time and again my 
courage and finances failed me. Ten years ago, I enquired about how to 
replace the denture, but the procedure sounded terrifying.

Back then,
 getting a more permanent tooth would have involved cutting in half two 
good neighbouring teeth and building a bridge with a false tooth over 
the gap. No, sireee, that wasn't for me.

Finally, though, I've been 
nagged into submission by my wife. She never minded the look, but I had 
complained about the denture a lot. Also, while in most areas I'd become
 less bothered about my appearance the older I got, I found I really 
wanted to have a full set of good teeth again.

That front tooth had 
been knocked out twice - both times playing hockey. When I was 12, a 
ball bobbled up, I wasn't wearing a gum shield (idiot) and it cracked my
 top front left tooth in half.

The dentist removed the nerve and 
patched the gaps with filling material. That lasted until a university 
hockey match, when I took a stick to the chin. I was wearing a gum 
shield this time, but the tooth wobbled loose.

I waited months before
 visiting the same dentist. He pushed the tooth then, without warning, 
ripped it out. There was a searing pain and my mouth filled with blood.

That was enough to fill me with a permanent dread of the dentist. In 15 years, I probably had two check-ups.

You can't tell it's not a real tooth as it was carefully matched to the colour of James' existing teeth

But
 it did at least prompt me to take good care of the teeth I had left - 
steering clear of fizzy drinks and sweets, and becoming a meticulous 
brusher. Probably more by luck than judgment, I never seemed to suffer 
any problems.

The denture itself - a plastic plate with a plastic 
tooth attached to it - was a neat fit, and unless you really stared, you
 couldn't tell the plastic tooth from the real ones.

Most 
acquaintances never knew I had it - save for the odd mortifying moment 
(spitting it into a drink as I chatted to a colleague at a Christmas 
party or losing it over the side of a boat on holiday).

But there 
were times it could cause throbbing pain, particularly where the top of 
the plastic tooth rubbed against my gum, and discomfort at the back of 
my mouth where the plate met my teeth.

Worse, dentists call them 'gum killers', because dentures make gums recede and can cause infection from the constant pressure.

There
 are an estimated 11 million denture users, and according to the charity
 British Dental Health Foundation, most will experience some degree of 
difficulty. 'While dentures are a good solution for people who need 
them, they are no substitute for natural teeth,' says the charity chief 
executive Dr Nigel Carter.

Problems include poor fit, ulcers and 
difficulty with chewing or speech. 'And the earlier teeth are lost, the 
more problems are likely to be experienced in later life as the 
supporting bone for a denture shrinks away.'

Having an implant fitted
 involves drilling a hole in the jawbone and inserting a screw, which 
will then hold a replacement porcelain tooth in place.

Last December,
 I made an appointment with Dr Eddie Scher in Chelsea, London, who is a 
leading specialist in oral surgery. As I sat in his waiting area, my 
hands went clammy, my legs shook. I'd crossed the rubicon.

Dr Scher came into the room and cracked a weak gag. I chuckled and he led me to his surgery.'Do
 you know why I made that joke?' he asked. 'I'd already started the 
consultation. I wanted to see how you smile - to see if you had a big 
Julia Roberts grin.

'I need to see if you show your gums when you smile, and then we can be sure we get the right tooth for you.'

The drop in heart attack risk by having teeth cleaned by a dentist at least twice in two years

As many as one in ten adults suffers from dental phobia: it is the third most common phobia after agoraphobia and heights.

A
 phobia of dentists is triggered by many things - the sound of the 
drills, fear of choking, chronic embarrassment, the needles. Mine is all
 about fear of pain and the powerlessness.

You can get it treated. A 
specialist clinic at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in London treats 
3,000 to 4,000 patients a year for dental phobia and has long waiting 
lists.

Or you can find a dentist who is particularly supportive. Dr 
Scher is a walking, talking anaesthetic. His soft-spoken charm put me at
 total ease even as he ran through the various procedures.

There 
were risks. The implant might not fix in my mouth, it could get 
infected. Then there was talk of making incisions and fixing things in 
my mouth.

They sounded terrifying - but Dr Scher described them so 
practically that by the end of the conversation I was almost ready to go
 ahead there and then.

'We're going to do a tooth in a day,' he 
said. I was staggered, having imagined weeks of appointments. Implant 
surgery has come on hugely since I last checked.

These days, using 
the latest X-rays, 3D imaging and piezo drill technology - a special 
type of precision drill - Dr Scher would drill precisely into my jaw and
 insert a screw socket.

If needed, bits of bone from my jaw could be
 grafted on to the implant site to help the healing process and plasma 
from my blood used to help heal the area. This would also speed up the 
healing of my gum.

He'd then put in a tiny screw and cement an implant on top.

I'd
 be in at 8am and home by 6pm. The success rate is 95 per cent, though 
all I could think is that this meant one in every 20 fails and ends up 
falling out.

And dental implants are not cheap. Classed as cosmetic 
surgery, they are not funded by the NHS. A basic implant costs around 
£2,000.

On the day of the surgery, I was given a sedative. It didn't 
knock me out, but made me forget. One minute I was in the waiting room 
nervously reading the paper, the next I was being escorted to a room to 
sleep off the drug. I'd been in surgery three hours and the screw was 
in.

I had to wait a few hours for the swelling in my gum to settle 
down. By 5pm, a temporary plastic tooth was glued on top and I went home
 with a soft toothbrush to use, antibiotics, painkillers - and very 
precise instructions to eat soft foods and take care in trying not to 
bump the tooth for a couple of months.

Some gums bleed in the days after, but luckily mine didn't.

A
 few weeks later, after the bone had grown around the screw - to ensure 
it was firmly in place and my mouth had healed - I had a permanent 
porcelain tooth glued over the screw.

It should last ten years or 
more. You can't even tell it's not a real tooth as it was carefully 
matched to the colour of my existing teeth.

Oddly, losing the 
denture has proved a bit like losing a limb. Now it's gone, I constantly
 think it's there  - and when I realise it isn't, I fly into a quiet 
panic thinking everyone can see me toothless. And then I remember...

The new tooth does need extra care - particularly flossing, to make sure nothing gets stuck around the top of it.

But
 not having that horrible plastic plate in my mouth has been joyful. I 
can barely believe I put off having the surgery for almost two decades.
