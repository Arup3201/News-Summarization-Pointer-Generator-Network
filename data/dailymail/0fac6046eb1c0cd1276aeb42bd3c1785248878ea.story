If you feel that you’ve seen these people before, you’re probably right.

This is the Phillips family, whose wholesome looks and winning smiles have earned them roles in hundreds of adverts.

As Britain’s most sought-after modelling family, they have appeared in newspaper and magazine adverts for everything from supermarkets to holidays.

Look familiar? You may have seen them on the back of your cereal box or on the brochure to your holiday. With hundreds of adverts under their belt, the Phillips family are the faces of products including cars and chocolate

Selling power: The family star in commercials up to eight times a month. Whether its frolicking in the sea (left) or sipping a coffee (right) they can get up to £6,000 for each job

Jason and Michelle Phillips, their sons Louis, 15, Luca, five, and Cobie, three, and daughter Evie, one, are signed to one of the country’s biggest modelling agencies.

Advertisers are so keen to use them that they model together eight times a month for up to £6,000 a go.

Industry experts say it is rare to find an entire family of appealing people who all want to take part in shoots. And they say the chemistry of a real family makes for better adverts than a group of strangers put together for a day.

They have worked as far afield as Barbados, Majorca, Ibiza, the Maldives, Holland, Austria and France.

Mr Phillips, 42, from Cardiff, has been modelling since he was 16 and decided to get his family involved.

He said: ‘It’s the easiest job in the world, the money’s fantastic, I travel to some of the most beautiful places on earth with my family and I enjoy every part of it.

Strike a pose: Even when they're off set, three-year-old Cobie (left) and five-year-old Luca (right) can't help but pull faces for the camera. Mr Phillips said his family are like a Welsh version of the Waltons and it's easy to see why from this adorable shot

I wouldn’t change it for the world. All my children enjoy doing it together. We’re like a Welsh version of the Waltons.’

The family have worked for Cheltenham & Gloucester Building Society, Audi, Cadbury, Mercedes, Disney, Zirtek hayfever tablets, holiday firms Haven Hoseasons and Thomson and hundreds of other companies.

Mrs Phillips has even modelled while pregnant, and her husband said: ‘The money we earn is saved up for the children’s future.

'We make sure they invest it properly and our eldest Louis has been able to buy a flat with it for when he grows up.’

Despite the glamorous lifestyle and easy money, the family say they take nothing for granted.

Mr Phillips said: ‘Looks don’t last for ever so we’re just enjoying ourselves and as parents giving our children the best start to life with a secure financial future.’

Snap happy: Father Jason began modelling when he was 16 and encouraged his family to get involved. Industry experts say it is rare to get a whole family who are attractive and appealing to work together
