Rene Meulensteen has admitted West Ham have rejected a bid from Fulham to buy Ravel Morrison.

It is believed Fulham offered around £4million for the 20-year-old but West Ham want nearer £10million.

Meulensteen worked with Morrison at Manchester United and suggested an improved bid would be submitted, with the youngster keen to make the switch across London.

‘We got knocked back,’ he said. ‘We 
need to review it and move on. I left it with (chief executive) Alistair
 Mackintosh. I’ve explained what I think about the situation so we’ll 
have to see what happens.

‘I
 make my desires clear then leave it to those people to deal with it. We
 will review it because I don’t know exactly the ins and outs of how 
it’s been rejected.

‘(Morrison offers) youthfulness, energy, unpredictability, strength. Loads of things.’

Impact: Morrison impressed in his cameo appearance against Fulham earlier this season

Meulensteen
 said he hoped a deal could be concluded this window but added: ‘We all 
know it’s very difficult in January transfer window. Why would clubs do 
business early? They know the longer they wait the higher the price 
goes.’

When asked 
whether Morrison would want to join Fulham, the Dutch boss replied: 'I 
have known him a long time. Yes. He does want to come here.'

Morrison has 18 
months left on his current £15,000-per-week deal at Upton Park and 
negotiations to extend his contract have broken down.

It has been revealed a clause in his contract stipulates his wages at Upton Park must quadruple to £60,000 per week if a club offers £10million, Rene Meulensteen is understood to want to use his personal connection with Morrison, from their time together at Manchester United, to help engineer a switch to Craven Cottage.

While the Cottagers are obviously keen on bringing Ravel in from the fellow relegation strugglers, Sam Allardyce insisted they would do everything to keep him at the club, as well as dismissing reports of a transfer request from the youngster.

'There's no truth in that [transfer request]. But I'm not surprised there's another rumour about Ravel Morrison.'

He added: 'We haven't had any discussions about Ravel Morrison being sold by this club.' Morrison, who has 18 months left on a contract he signed in January 2012, is West Ham's top scorer this season with five goals.
