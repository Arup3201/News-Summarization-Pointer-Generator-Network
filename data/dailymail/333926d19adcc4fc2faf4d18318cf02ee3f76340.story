Lord Hill, is said to have tried to quit his job as education minister but was unable to after Cameron ignored him

When education minister Lord Hill decided to quit his post, the biggest challenge was telling the Prime Minister face-to-face.

After a string of cancelled meetings, 
the peer finally received some time with David Cameron – but the 
resignation didn’t quite go as planned.

In a scene that could have come from 
political satire The Thick Of It, sources say Mr Cameron was too 
distracted to realise his visitor was quitting.

Instead of accepting – or protesting –
Lord Hill’s decision, he reportedly told him to carry on his good work,
and strode out of the room after being told he was late for a 
photocall.

Lord Hill was left bemused – and very 
much still in his post. He went on to be the only member of Education 
Secretary Michael Gove’s team to survive the recent reshuffle.

The minister, who worked as a 
political secretary for Sir John Major before setting up a PR firm, had 
told friends that he had had enough of his current job after spending 
two years taking education Bills through the House of Lords.

David Cameron, left, was so distracted when Hill told him he wanted to resign as part of Michael Gove's team, right, that he appeared not to hear

He has said he has ‘no intention of 
commenting’ on the reshuffle, adding: ‘I am delighted to be at the 
Department for Education.’

A Downing Street spokesman said they would not comment on private discussions between ministers.
