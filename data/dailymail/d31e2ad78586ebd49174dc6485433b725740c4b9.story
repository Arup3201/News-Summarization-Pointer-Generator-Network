David Beckham's intelligence, or alleged lack of it, could be about to land the New Zealand Prime Minister in trouble.

John Key is accused of labeling the former England captain as 'thick as bat s***' on a recent visit to a school in Auckland.

It is claimed that the PM was discussing a 2008 exhibition match between Mr Beckham's LA Galaxy and local side the Oceania All-Stars at the time.

Guest: David Beckham pays a visit to New Zealand in 2008, when he also met current Prime Minister John Key. Recalling their meeting during a recent visit to an Auckland school, Mr Key is accused of labeling the former England captain as 'thick as bat s***'

Mr Key first described Mr Beckham as handsome and 'a really nice guy', before adding the offensive remark, according to Radio New Zealand.

But when pressed about the claims, Mr Key refused to confirm or deny what had been said.

'That is someone that thinks they have overheard a conversation I have had,' he said on breakfast television. 'I am not going to engage in that because otherwise I am engaging in every conversation that someone thinks I have.'

The presenter pushed the Prime Minister for an answer, adding: 'Can I just clarify that you are saying that you didn’t call David Beckham thick?'

Mr Key replied: 'No, what I am saying is that somebody has overheard a personal conversation and that’s their recollection of it. I am just not going to engage in discussions about that. That’s their view.'

Under fire: Mr Key refused to answer whether or not he mocked the footballer's intelligence

It is not the first time Mr Key has landed 
himself in trouble, nor indeed is it the only time in the last seven 
days.

He angered the gay and lesbian community on Friday when he referred to a 
radio presenter's jacket as 'gay'.

When preparing for a golf challenge, he said: 'You're munted mate, you're never going to make it, you've got that gay red top on.'

After the latest gaffe, one user took to Twitter comparing Mr Key with Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy character, Borat.

@guywilliamsguy wrote: 'John Key is quickly becoming to New Zealand what Borat was the Kazakhstan,' in reference to the negative publicity brought on the nation.
