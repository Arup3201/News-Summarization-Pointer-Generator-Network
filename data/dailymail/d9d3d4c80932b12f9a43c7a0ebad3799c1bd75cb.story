Sir Cliff Richard, pictured, was interviewed by detectives over a child sex abuse allegation 

Sir Cliff Richard was interviewed yesterday by detectives investigating claims that he sexually assaulted a schoolboy at a Christian rally almost three decades ago – and denied the allegation.

The veteran star returned to Britain and voluntarily met officers from South Yorkshire Police but was not arrested or charged, said his spokesman.

He ‘entered South Yorkshire police premises by arrangement,’ said a statement released by the force, and was interviewed under caution.

It is claimed that he assaulted a 
youngster under the age of 16 at an event held by American evangelist 
Billy Graham at Sheffield United’s Bramall Lane stadium in 1985.

The development comes nine days after a controversial raid by police on the 73-year-old’s £3.1 million Berkshire apartment that was broadcast live on the BBC.

Last night his spokesman said: ‘Sir Cliff Richard voluntarily met with and was interviewed by members of South Yorkshire Police. He was not arrested or charged.

‘He co-operated fully with officers and answered the questions put to him. Other than restating that this allegation is completely false and that he will continue to co-operate fully with police, it would not be appropriate for Sir Cliff to say anything further at this time.’

Earlier, the police chief leading the investigation into Sir Cliff accused the BBC of a ‘cover-up’ over how its journalists learned the star’s property would be raided.

The Corporation has received 762 complaints over its live coverage of the incident.

Sir Cliff was furious it was broadcast on TV before he had been spoken to by police. It led to an outcry from fans and MPs.

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the claims of a cover-up were a ‘matter of deep concern’.

He was left furious after the BBC screened the search live while he had been given no prior warning

He has summoned the South Yorkshire chief constable and BBC director general Lord Hall to appear before his committee on September 2. Lord Hall has insisted that BBC journalists ‘acted appropriately’ in their coverage of the story.

It emerged last week that Sir Cliff has pulled out of a visit to the US Open tennis championships in New York and turned down the freedom of his adopted Portuguese home town of Albufeira.

He also cancelled an appearance at a charity event at Canterbury Cathedral next month because he does not want the event to be ‘overshadowed by the false allegation’.

Sir Cliff 
reacted with fury earlier this month after learning that police were 
searching his £3million apartment in Sunningdale, Berkshire - while the 
BBC filmed live - when he had no prior notice.

He
 was on holiday in Portugal at the time and has since met lawyers in the Algarve before returning to the UK ahead of 
yesterday's meeting with police.

Since
 his arrest, a number of celebrities have come out in support of the 
former pop star, while others have criticised the handling of the raid.

Cilla Black said in a statement earlier this week: 'Cliff is a very close friend of mine and has been for a million years.

'I, like everyone else, was shocked to hear of these allegations and I am absolutely positive that they are without foundation.'

Former BBC journalist Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, has described the investigation as a 'witch-hunt' and attacked the BBC for an 'error of judgment'.

The BBC has refused to reveal its source, but says it did not find out from South Yorkshire Police, which carried out the raid.

South Yorkshire Police sources have blamed staff working on Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police-led inquiry into historic sexual abuse, for the leak.

The police chief leading the case has criticised the BBC over the ‘improper and unauthorised’ way journalists had learned that officers were set to search Sir Cliff’s £3million home.

Chief constable David Crompton said he had complained to the BBC about an article on its website stating the force had deliberately attempted to ‘ensure maximum coverage’.

He added: ‘This appeared to be an attempt by the BBC to distance itself from what had taken place and cover up the fact that it had initiated contact with the force about the story.’
