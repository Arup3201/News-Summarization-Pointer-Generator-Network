'Excessive speed': Michael Yeates, 20, was sentenced to three years jail after he hit and killed an 80-year-old man

A young man has been jailed after he mowed down and killed a Royal British Legion standard bearer while driving at ‘excessive speed’ to show off his souped-up car.

Michael Yeates, 20, had only passed his driving test three months earlier and had already written off one vehicle when he hit Frank Fielding, 80, in Rishton, Lancashire.

Eye witnesses said they heard the ‘roar of an engine’ and noticed Yeates looking down, not paying attention to the road ahead in the lead up to the fatal accident.

Tests showed he was travelling at 47mph in the 30mph zone when he hit Mr Fielding as he crossed the road outside a local library in October last year.

The victim, a widower and grandfather of five, suffered fatal injuries and later died at Royal Blackburn Hospital.

Yeates, of Longridge near Preston, admitted causing death by dangerous driving at Preston Court yesterday and was sentence to three years in jail.

He also admitted insurance fraud after he failed to notify his insurers about engine changes after he replaced the engine of his new 1.2 litre Vauxhall Nova with a 1.6 litre engine, making his policy invalid.

Judge Jonathan Gibson, in passing sentence, said: ‘No sentence I can pass can ever compensate Mr Fielding’s family for their very great loss.

Killed: Frank Fielding, 80, suffered fatal injuries when Yeates' car hit him as he crossed the road. He was a long-serving member of Rishton's Royal British Legion branch

‘What you did highlights the very grave dangers posed by driving at excessive speed and the catastrophic consequences that can result from that and a failure to observe the road ahead.

‘Your driving was plainly irresponsible and the consequences beyond description.’

In court Mr Fielding was described as a ‘sprightly man’ and ‘active member of the community’, serving the Royal Horse Guards in Chelsea and Windsor for 10 years and was a long-serving member of Rishton’s Royal British Legion branch.

He regularly supported poppy campaigns and in September last year was the standarad bearer at the funeral of a local marine commando who was killed in Afghanistan.

Eye witness Antonia Bates said she heard the roar of an engine and saw Mr Fielding crossing the road at about 5pm on October 18.

In a statement she said: ‘I looked and saw the driver of the car. He wasn’t looking ahead. He was looking down towards the gearstick.

Where he was hit: Mr Fielding was crossing the road near the local library in Rishton, Lancashire when Yeates mowed him down. According to tests, he was driving 47mph in the 30mph zone

‘As he looked up he had no time to react. He hit the man and pressed the brakes at the same time.’

Yeates had initially tried to blame Mr Fielding for the crash, claiming he ran onto the road. He told paramedics: ‘Why did he run out? He hesitated and he just ran out. He was in the middle of the road.’

But his consel Sharon Watson said: ‘This is a young man who is terribly, terribly sorry for the suffering he has brought on the Fielding family.’

Yeates had passed his driving test in August last year but just three days later wrecked a 1.6 Vauxhall Nova when he drove it into a hedge. 

He then acquired another Nova, a less powerful 1.2litre, but without telling insurers he changed the engine and gearbox to the more powerful versions taken from the wrecked model.

Judge Jonathan Gibson said at Preston Court yesterday: 'No sentence I can pass can ever compensate Mr Fielding's family for their very great loss'

Yeates was disqualified from driving for five years and ordered to take an extended test before he can return to the wheel.

After the case Sgt Dave Hogarth from Lancashire Constabulary said: ‘This is a tragic case for both families and highlights the stupidity of reckless speeding, which played a huge part in this tragic incident.

‘The terrible consequences of this collision should serve as a strong warning to people not to speed.’

Former Hyndburn mayor and Mr Fielding’s family friend Paul Barton said: ‘Frank was known by everyone in Rishton and thought of the people in the town as his family.

‘He was a true gentleman, a gentle giant and I just found it so, so tragic the way he died. I feel sorry for both families involved, they will be feeling it too. Frank as the people’s champion in Rishton for so many years. He was a cracking fellow.’
