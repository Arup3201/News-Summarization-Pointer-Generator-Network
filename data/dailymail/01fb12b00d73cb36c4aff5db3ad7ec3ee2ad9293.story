The Barclays Premier League returned with a bang over the weekend, with spectacular goals, thrilling football, moments of controversy and some late drama.

We've watched all of the 26 goals again - with a little help from our friends at Opta - and here's the full breakdown of how they were scored.

PAYING THE PENALTY

The opening weekend saw three penalties awarded in the 10 games, with one scored and two missed.

Saido Berahino slotted home to open the scoring for West Brom against Sunderland after referee Neil Swarbrick had adjudged Valentin Roberge to have tangled a little too closely with Victor Anichebe.

Out of character: Mark Noble missed his penalty for West Ham against Tottenham

At Upton Park, Mark Noble fired wide from 12 yards - his first penalty miss in 10 - as West Ham went down 1-0 to Tottenham in the London derby.

And Charlie Austin had a Premier League debut to forget when Allan McGregor saved his spot-kick at Loftus Road. 

There were three penalty goals on the opening day last season and five the season prior to that. 

SET-PIECE SPECIALISTS

They are the spectacular goals that get us on our feet, but there were no goals direct from free-kicks on the opening weekend. 

This is in contrast to last season's first weekend, when two were scored - Frank Lampard rifled home for Chelsea against Hull and Yaya Toure curled one in for Man City against Newcastle.  

Some came close, like Wayne Rooney, who curled one against the outside of the post in Manchester United's defeat by Swansea, or the fan who ran 70 yards across the pitch to take one at Upton Park.

INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE BOX

The vast majority of the weekend's goals (24) were tucked away from inside the penalty box, with just two scored from outside. 

This is a low count compared to recent form - there were six long-range hits on the opening day last season and five the year before that. 

It perhaps demonstrates a trend of working the ball into the box with passing, rather than shooting from range.

There was Lee Cattermole's superb 25-yard strike for Sunderland at West Brom and Ki Sung-yeung's curled effort from just outside the area to give Swansea the lead at Old Trafford.

HEADERS

The opening round saw three headed goals and, in a trend that maybe shows the decline of high crossing in favour of passing moves and all of them came from set-piece situations. 

At Loftus Road, Hull defender James Chester won a battle of strength with Rio Ferdinand to head home Stephen Quinn's corner and settle the contest. 

The other two came 10 minutes apart at the Emirates - Brede Hangeland was left unmarked to meet a Jason Puncheon corner and give Crystal Palace the lead, before Laurent Koscielny bent his run to get in behind the defence and nod in Alexis Sanchez's free-kick to equalise.

Four headed goals were scored this time last year.

WHICH FOOT?

16 of the 26 came with the right foot and seven with the left. Both of Swansea's goals came off the left boot, Ki sweeping home and Gylfi Sigurdsson slotting home the late winner. 

Eric Dier also slotted home after rounding goalkeeper Adrian to score Tottenham's late winner at West Ham.

PASSING STATS

The weekend underlined once again how English football's top flight has thrown aside the traditional long ball game in favour of short and precise passing. 

87.48 per cent of attempted passes in the 10 matches were short - 7,951 in total - with just 1,138 over a longer range. 

This stat has remained consistently in the high eighties for the last three or four seasons now.  

The best example was, of course, Andre Schurrle's magnificent goal for Chelsea at Burnley. This comprised 23 passes, working the ball from one end of the pitch to the other, before Cesc Fabregas played the final killer ball into Schurrle to finish with aplomb.

TOTAL GOALS

The 26 goals scored is one more than this time last year but some way short of the 33 racked up on the opening weekend of the 2006-2007 season, helped by Man United's 5-1 thrashing of Fulham and Reading's 3-2 home win over Middlesbrough. 

The lowest in the last decade came in 2011-2012 with just 18 scored and three goalless draws.
