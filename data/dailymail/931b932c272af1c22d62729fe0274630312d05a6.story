There is a well-worn saying that footballers should always play the game, not the occasion. 

Given that Sunday's eagerly-anticipated Old Firm clash will be the first for many of those on the pitch, that adage seems particularly poignant.

Derby debutants could do a lot worse than talk to David Robertson. The Ibrox legend was no stranger to high-pressure semi-finals before arriving at Ibrox in 1991, having won the Scottish Cup and League Cup with Aberdeen.

Yet in his first Old Firm last-four encounter wearing the blue shirt of Rangers — a Scottish Cup showdown against Celtic at Hampden — he let the hype and hubris get the better of him. 

Then a 23-year-old left-back, Robertson's afternoon lasted just six minutes after he was shown a straight red for a body-check on Bhoys winger Joe Miller.

'I lasted six minutes in the semi in 1992 and that's what I'm famous for now,' reflected Robertson, who was back at Hampden studying for his UEFA Pro Licence this week. 'It's the most nerve-racking game I ever had.

'After I was sent off, I went into the dressing room and I heard all of this thumping from people banging on the old wooden stairs.

'Wee Doddy (Rangers kit man George Souter) came running in and told me it was a goal and I was thinking: 'Oh no.' But it was Coisty (Ally McCoist) who had scored to put us 1-0 up and I went to watch the second half.

'Celtic did what they did in those days and pounded us to death. We managed to hang on and I was more relieved than anyone else. It was a great occasion but I still felt as though I had let everyone down.'

Amongst the current Rangers camp, seven have experienced the derby against Celtic — but for the likes of Fraser Aird, Nicky Law and Jon Daly, Sunday's League Cup semi-final at Hampden will be their first taste.

Nicky Law has never played for Rangers in an Old Firm derby against Celtic before 

Robertson (right) — who won six league titles with Rangers during the nine-in-a-row era — warned that nothing can quite prepare a player for the intensity of the fixture.

'I've played in Rangers games against Aberdeen and for Aberdeen against Celtic, big games, but in my first Old Firm game you couldn't hear anyone,' he added. 'I was trying to give an instruction to Goughie (Richard Gough) and he couldn't hear me. You are almost on your own.

'My first game was at Parkhead. I'd go and take a throw-in and people are spitting on you and doing all sorts of stuff. Obviously, those days have changed a little bit.

'It's going to be a strange atmosphere there and, hopefully, the Rangers supporters forget about the turmoil that's going on and really get behind the team and make it a bit of a spectacle.

'They are the underdogs, probably for the first time in a long time in any game, but it's a good chance for the team and the players to try to prove people wrong,' added the now 46-year-old Robertson, currently a director of boys coaching at Sereno Soccer Club in Phoenix, Arizona.

'Rangers will need to show their character. It's the first time the clubs have met since all of the problems and now they are on their way back up.

'Every cup tie they have played on that journey against Premiership opposition, they have been expected to win. So this is the first where there isn't any expectation because all of the pressure will be on Celtic.

'You never know what will happen in a cup semi-final. All of these guys will relish playing in this game and they will see what's at stake. It will give them an escape from all of the drama that's going on at the moment.'
