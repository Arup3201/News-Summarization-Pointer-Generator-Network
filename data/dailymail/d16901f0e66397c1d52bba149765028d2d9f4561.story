John Moylan had been a longtime member of the board of directors for the Golden Gate district when, in 2008, following years of campaigning, controversy and debate, they decided to install suicide barriers on the Golden Gate Bridge in an effort to stop the two dozen people that jump from the structure each year.

But on Thursday the 85-year-old lost his grandson, Sean Moylan, 27, to the same San Francsico span he has tirelessly tried to make safer.

It was said to be the second time the 'troubled' young man, from Novato, in the city's North Bay area, had tried to take his own life.

Mr Moylan had previously lost a grandnephew to suicide, which added drive of his push for the barriers.

Gone too soon: Sean Moylan, 27, of Novoto, jumped to his death from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco on Thursday, despite his grandfather spending years trying to make the site more resistant to suicide attempts

Advocate: John Moylan is a longtime bridge district director who was board president in 2008 when directors made the historic decision to move forward with a suicide barrier after years of debate and controversy

More than 1,500 people have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge - which has a 220 feet drop to the water from road-level - since it opened in 1937

On Saturday Mr Moylan said that while the incident had been 'heartbreaking' for him and his family, he refused to blame the bridge or its barriers for the suicide.

'The poor kid was a very troubled young man,' he told local paper The Marin Independent Journal.

'He was generous and good natured, but he just had that demon in there.

'There is no blame in this at all. It's not the bridge's fault, it's not anybody's fault.

'It's just that he was a very troubled young man. He had a problem and that's it.'

In February, Sean Moylan, while dealing with the breakdown of a relationship, stepped in front of a commercial truck on a highway in Oregon.

At the time police said he was out walking his dog near the town of Eugene, but had let go of the dog's leash before walking into the path of the truck.

Sean was critically injured after the driver was unable to stop.

However his grandfather said he appeared to have fully recovered from the injuries when he had lunch with him last Sunday.

'My niece was here from Ireland and he was laughing and talking with the kids,' Mr Moylan told the paper.

'Everything was fine.'

A body believed to be Sean's was pulled from the water by the Coast Guard about 4.22pm Thursday.

Mr Moylan said there is a bridge board meeting slated for June 29 to discuss funding for a suicide net under the bridge - a $68 million project that has been under discussion for some time.

Mr Moylan said Sean's death will very much be on his mind during the meeting.

More than 1,500 people have jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge - which stands about 220 feet from the road to the water - since it opened in 1937.

Another 80 or so contemplating suicide are pulled off the bridge every year.

Mr Moylan said he has always been at the forefront of bringing in barriers and imposing other means that would safeguard the bridge from suicide attempts.

'But that's not going to stop suicide,' he said.

'Suicide is an epidemic in this country.

'Sean will be thought about at the next board meeting, that's for sure, and all the others.

'But we can't lay it on the bridge.'
