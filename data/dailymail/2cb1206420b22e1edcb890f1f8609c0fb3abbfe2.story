Christopher Dean Owens, 20, died on Sunday after police suspect he took a home-made ecstasy tablet at his home in South Shields

Police have issued a fresh warning over the dangers of home-made drugs after a man died taking what is believed to be an ecstasy tablet.

Christopher Owens, from South Shields, was taken to South Tyneside District Hospital after his father called the ambulance service on Sunday morning.

The 20-year-old had suffered a fit in his home and it is thought he had taken an illegal substance.

Police were called to the address at around 2.20pm and confirmed the tablet taken was a pale green colour.

While
 most ecstasy pills found on the market are believed to be imported from
 Holland and Belgium, officers described this batch as 'potentially 
home-made'.

Residents have spoken of their shock at finding out about Mr Owens.

Marie
 Smith, who lives next door, said it was confusing with police and 
ambulance vehicles blocking the street on Sunday morning.

'It
 was like a hospital,' she said. 'There were blue flashing lights 
everywhere and a few hours later the police arrived with their dogs.

Ms Smith continued: 'When
 the paramedics brought the young man out he was wearing very little and
 he had an oxygen mask on his face. He looked in a really bad way. I 
knew immediately that drugs had to be involved.

'I've lived here for over 23 years, but I didn't know the family very well because they've only lived here 18 months and they kept themselves to themselves.

'I don't think there was a mother living with them, I only ever saw the dad.'

A woman who lives nearby, but did not wish to be named, said she's still in a state of shock.

'It's absolutely unbelievable,' she said. 'He was far too young to die and it must be devastating for the family. I can't believe this has happened on such a quiet road like ours.'

Police have issued a warning of
the dangers of taking illegal drugs. South Tyneside coroner Mr Carney has also expressed his concerns for members of the public taking any similar tablets.Â 

Detective Inspector Paul Woods said: 
'These tablets are potentially very dangerous and anyone thinking of 
taking any drug, particularly one similar to this, should not.

'If anyone thinks they have taken this drug they should seek immediate medical attention.'

So far, no arrests have been made.
