Plans: Nick Clegg plans to create communities with at least 15,000 homes across the South of England

Families living in new garden cities would be encouraged to grow their own food in allotments under plans drawn up by Nick Clegg.

The Deputy Prime Minister wants to create planned communities with at least 15,000 homes each across the South of England centred around large garden plots.

His vision of the modern ‘Good Life’ was unveiled yesterday after years of wrangling with the Tories.

A document for ‘locally-led garden cities’ said they should provide ‘opportunities for residents to grow their own food, including generous allotments’.

Aides later said this would encourage ‘sustainability’ and that surveys showed people valued allotments and growing their own vegetables.

Ministers will start working on plans for three garden cities by the end of August.

Mr Clegg vowed to cut help remove planning red tape and secure a share of the £2.4 billion funding for private developers.

But officials have stressed that the garden cities must be backed by local residents to get the go ahead.

Garden cities would not be ‘imposed’ on areas and they would ensure ‘public services, green spaces and amenities are hard-wired into designs from the beginning.’

Mr Clegg has argued that his garden cities would be better than ‘highly contentious’ developments on the outskirts of towns and cities.

There was an ‘ark of prosperity’ stretching from Oxford to Cambridge where many people wanted to live but were unable to find or afford houses.

He named Bicester in Oxfordshire as one such place and officials have also pointed to Cranbrook in East Devon, Wokingham in Surrey and Didcot in Oxfordshire.

‘People are starting to understand, particularly in that ark of prosperity that goes from Oxford right through to Cambridge, where more and more people want to live but simply can’t live at the moment or are totally priced out of the housing market altogether, one way of making sure that more families can live there, more people work there, more kids can go to school... is to plan it properly through garden cities.’

He argued we need developments like Welwyn Garden City when residents will grow their own foods

He rejected an accusation from National Trust director Dame Helen Ghosh that councils are being ‘hustled’ into allowing development on greenfield land by central Government.

Mr Clegg said: ‘The point for those who care about the countryside is to ask oneself ‘is the best way to protect our countryside a rash of often rather unplanned, highly contentious encroachments on to our countryside as existing developments are extended?’

‘That’s what’s been going on for years. It creates huge local controversy and aggravation, it leads as well to housing developments which are not supported adequately by the right transport infrastructure, school infrastructure or local amenities and shops.

‘My point has always been, let’s return to the genius of the people who have the vision of saying ‘we need a Milton Keynes, we need a Welwyn Garden City, we need Hatfield’.’

Green belt development was at its lowest in 20 years, he said.

Hilary Benn, Labour’s shadow communities secretary, said: ‘After four wasted years of empty and over-hyped announcements on garden cities it is only now that ministers have got around to inviting bids for development.

'We need a new Milton Keynes' he told people gathered at a launch of his new community

'This Tory-led Government has presided over the lowest levels of house building in peacetime since the 1920s and the publication of this long-delayed document is far too little, too late.

‘Ministers’ failure to take the real action needed to tackle the housing crisis will mean that home ownership remains out of reach of many low and middle-income earners, rents will continue to rise and waiting lists will grow ever longer.’

John Rowley, planning officer for the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England, said: 'CPRE’s Planning Officer said garden cities should only be built on previously developed sites with good rail access.

'We must seek to minimise the unnecessary loss of greenfield land that is so important for quality of life, food production and flood management.’

Tory peer and Next tycoon Lord Wolfson, who is offering a £250,000 prize for ideas on how to build a new garden city, welcomed the plans.

He said garden cities would ‘take pressure off London’s Green Belt and valuable countryside like the Chilterns, as well as preventing unplanned incremental edge-of-village development across the South East’.
