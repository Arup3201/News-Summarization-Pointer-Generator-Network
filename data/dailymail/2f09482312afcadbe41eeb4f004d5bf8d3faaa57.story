They are the new big three of American golf — and no, they don’t go by names like Tiger, Phil or Rickie. Meet Michelle, Stacy and Lexi, the trio who have breathed fresh life into the struggling women’s game.

At a time when the men’s variety is crying out for an old-fashioned rivalry, these three are regularly battling each other down the stretch.

Each presently holds a major. Now they are bringing their compelling act to these shores, where they will start as three of the favourites for the Ricoh British Open at Royal Birkdale this week.

Star: Michelle Wie is an icon in women's golf and her rivalry with Lewis and Thompson is good for the game

Not just a pretty face: Wie shows off her US Open trophy in New York but she has earned her glory

Of course, it does not hurt that they are photogenic. Dressed in a dazzling aqua blue dress for a whirlwind day of publicity after winning the US Open last month, Michelle Wie showed she could hold her own in the fashion and beauty stakes alongside anyone on the tennis circuit.

What is great for women’s golf, though, is that there is much more to them than the fact they look good. This trio can really play and each has an intriguing story to tell of their rise to the top.

Lexi Thompson was playing in the US Open at the age of just 12. Now, still only 19, she has become the fully fledged article, with a major already to her name after winning the Kraft Nabisco Championship impressively in California in April.

Wie, of course, was the one who was always tipped for the top. At 14 she missed the cut in a men’s PGA Tour event in her native Hawaii by a single stroke, coming in with a better 36-hole score off the same tees than players as good as Adam Scott.

Young star: Lexi Thompson is still only 19 but made her US Open debut seven years ago

Thereafter, her struggles have been well-chronicled but she never gave in. Now, a decade later and with a degree from Stanford University also to her name, she is fulfilling all her promise.

The one they are both trying catch, however, is current world No1 and this week’s defending champion, Stacy Lewis. At 29, what a triumph for guts and determination her rise to the top represents.

Consider that for all her high school years Lewis had to wear a brace for 18 hours each day to correct a curvature of the spine.

She sat out playing golf during her first year at college because she was recovering from surgery, yet still went on to become one of the most decorated players in the amateur game. No wonder her website is: stacysback.com.

Right now she is playing the best golf of her life and holds a Tiger-like lead at the top of the rankings.

On top: World number one stacy Lewis stormed back to beat Wie in Arkansas last week

She has won three of her past seven events and showed her mental strength last Sunday. The task was to catch Wie in the final round, after she had beaten her into second place in the US Open the previous week.

In front of an adoring crowd in Arkansas, where she went to college, she pulled it off.

So after the first major of the season was won by Thompson over Wie and the second by Wie over Lewis, it would be no surprise if the trend continued at Birkdale, particularly if the event is blessed with sunshine.

Let’s not forget either the two precocious teenagers: Lydia Ko from New Zealand, just 17 and already the world No2; and our own Charley Hull, only 18 and yet a star of the last Solheim Cup.

The first of two successive Opens on England’s gilded North West coast promises to be every bit as fascinating as the men’s version at Royal Liverpool next week.
