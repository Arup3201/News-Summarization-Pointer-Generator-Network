Don’t throw orange peel, used teabags, fish bones and over-ripe tomatoes on the compost heap. They can have some surprising beauty benefits.

From improving nails and hair to deflating puffy eye bags, Mandy Francis takes a look at the foods in our diet that are actually beauty secrets . . .

Broccoli leaves to beat bumpy arms

Eating plenty of dark green vegetables like broccoli leaves will help to boost skin condition

A 30mg serving of these leaves — a small handful — can provide 70 per cent of your daily vitamin A requirement — almost twice as much as is in the equivalent serving of the florets.

‘One of the first signs of a diet that is deficient in vitamin A is dry, rough skin,’ says nutrition therapist Alice Mackintosh, who specialises in treating skin conditions through diet.

‘Eating plenty of dark green vegetables like broccoli leaves, which contain both betacarotene (a protective antioxidant converted into vitamin A by the body), and omega-3 fatty acids, will help to boost skin condition.’

Used teabags to deflate puffy eyes

To make your own caffeinated eye-booster, squeeze the excess fluid out of two used teabags — black or green — and put them in the fridge for ten minutes

A U.S. study in the Eighties showed that when applied topically, caffeine — the stimulant in tea and coffee — can have powerful anti-inflammatory effects.

Many major skincare manufacturers now use caffeine as a significant ingredient in their eye creams to help freshen and tighten skin around the eyes.

To make your own caffeinated eye-booster, squeeze the excess fluid out of two used teabags — black or green — and put them in the fridge for ten minutes. Then lie back and place the cold bags over your eyes for five minutes.

Dr Adam Friedmann, consultant dermatologist at the Whittington Hospital in North London, says: ‘While more research is needed to prove caffeine will work wonders around the eyes, the combination of the cool, wet bag and powerful antioxidants in tea could help to soothe inflammation and puffiness around the eyes.’

Fish bones for strong nails

Fish bones can be a great source of calcium

‘Don’t pick the bones out of tinned fish like salmon, pilchards and sardines,’ says Alice Mackintosh. ‘They are soft, edible and a great source of calcium.’

She adds: ‘Good calcium levels in the diet also have a positive impact on the skin. It’s an important mineral, alongside zinc, which is also found in fish bones and flesh, for keeping cell turn-over steady and consequently the complexion clear and itch-free.

Avocado skin for a radiant complexion

Avocados — a good source of protective antioxidant vitamin E and heart-healthy fats — are a welcome addition to our diets, and the skin also has hidden beauty benefits. Even Victoria Beckham, who can afford top skin care experts, is said to favour homemade avocado face masks.

So try this trick. Rub the inside of the skin over your face. Leave any pulp on your skin for 15 minutes then remove the residue with warm water and pat dry.

Dr Adam Friedmann says: ‘Applying anything oily and vitamin-rich, such as avocado pulp, to your complexion can help to moisturise skin.’

The fats in the avocado oil will help replenish moisturising factors in the skin. Antioxidants in the pulp have useful protective and healing qualities, too.

Melon seeds ward off wrinkles

Don’t bin melon seeds, either. ‘They are an excellent source of zinc, a mineral that is vital for efficient collagen production in the body,’ says Alice Mackintosh.

Collagen is a protein in the skin that helps to keep it looking plump and firm.

Although collagen levels drop as we age and can be damaged by UV exposure, smoking and poor diet, they can be preserved and boosted with a healthy diet and lifestyle.

Rinse the seeds and dry them with a clean cloth. Toast them in a medium oven or frying pan with a spritz of oil over a medium heat until they’ve started to brown on both sides

Cabbage leaves for a flatter tummy

Turn tough, outer cabbage leaves into sauerkraut for a flatter, less bloated stomach.

‘Sauerkraut, which is finely chopped cabbage fermented in salt with a few spices, contains up to 100 times more probiotic bacteria gram for gram than yogurt,’ says Alice Mackintosh.

Probiotics develop from the bacteria on the leaves as the sauerkraut ferments. ‘Probiotic foods help to keep our digestion healthy and improve intestinal function,’ says Ms Mackintosh.

Coffee grounds to rub away cellulite

Most cellulite-busting treatments contain caffeine these days, predominantly for its stimulant and diuretic effects — so why not apply used coffee grounds as a caffeine-rich scrub to your hips and thighs?

Dermatologist Dr Friedmann says: ‘There’s no proof that caffeine helps to reduce cellulite, but gentle exfoliation can improve circulation and the superficial look of skin on the hips, bottom and thighs.’

But he warns that coffee grounds might be too scratchy and harsh as a scrub on their own. So you could follow the lead of actress Halle Berry who, it’s rumoured, makes a body scrub by mixing a fistful of coffee grounds with a moisturising body wash in the shower.

Tatty tomatoes to protect your skin

In a study by researchers from the Universities of Manchester and Newcastle, lycopene — the protective antioxidant in the red pigment of tomatoes — was shown to boost the skin’s natural sun protection factor by as much as 33 per cent when eaten daily as tomato puree.

Chopping and cooking tomatoes boosts the amount of lycopene by releasing it from the cells of the fruit. So with sun damage the main cause of premature skin ageing — even in winter — it’s well worth turning your squashed, tatty tomatoes into antioxidant-rich soup or pasta sauce.

‘Don’t forget to add olive oil, too.’ says dietitian Sarah Schenker. ‘Lycopene is a fat soluable nutrient. The oil will help to release it from the fruit during the cooking process and allow the body to absorb it more readily when you eat it.’
