Cesc Fabregas admits he would 'love' to have his former Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi join him at Chelsea.

The pair played together as youngsters before being reunited at the Nou Camp following Fabregas' transfer from Arsenal in 2011.

The Spain international has since moved to Stamford Bridge  and has been one of the Blues' most consistent performers during their rise top the top of the Premier League table - racking up more assists than any other player.

When asked if he thinks Messi should join him in west London, Fabregas told Radio Marca: 'I wish! Why not? I'd love that to happen. I'd be all for it.

'As a Barca man, I believe that Messi deserves to retire there for all that he has given the club.

'He is a legend that has changed Barca's history. But, as his team-mate and friend, without doubt I'd love to have Leo by my side. 

'This season Barca are Messi and 10 others. Messi has saved his team on many occasions.'

The Spain international also claims that Jose Mourinho would be able to manage at the club where he started his career as a translator.

Jose Mourinho's philosophy at Chelsea is similar to Barcelona's, according to the Spanish midfielder

'I'd say that Barcelona have a style that he (Mourinho) has already experienced and understands perfectly,' he said. 

'Chelsea play a very similar game: we want to be the protagonists, have possession and look to score. We may have a different system, but the philosophy is similar.

'Mourinho adapts to the players he has. What makes him so great as a coach is that he adapts to any situation and his teams can play in many different ways. It's a very intelligent way of managing.'
