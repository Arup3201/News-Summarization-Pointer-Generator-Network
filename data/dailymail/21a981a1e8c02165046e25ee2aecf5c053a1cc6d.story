This is the shocking moment two men appeared to smoke crystal meth in the middle of the day while travelling on a tram in Manchester.

A commuter, who does not wish to be named, took the picture of the pair while on an East Didsbury-bound Metrolink tram on Monday evening.

The two youths, who appear to be in their teens, got on the tram before Central Park and stayed on past St Peter's Square in Manchester city centre.

The picture was taken as the tram stopped outside the headquarters of Greater Manchester Police in the Newton Heath area.

The commuter said: ‘I could see white smoke coming out of a plastic coke bottle and something was bubbling away in there.

‘I'm not sure what it was but something was bubbling away in there. It looked like what I've seen on Breaking Bad, it wasn't an electric cigarette that's for sure.’

‘I tried to take the picture discreetly. I wasn't sure what to do because I didn't know if I called the police or said something to them if they might attack me,’ she added.

Methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth, is a class A drug often compared to crack cocaine because it is also smoked and is highly addictive.

After taking the picture, the commuter on the tram then posted the image to Twitter, alerting Greater Manchester Police’s city centre Twitter account, but it took them 40 minutes to respond.

When they did, they told the woman to phone the non-emergency hotline number 101 if she saw it happening again.

They tweeted: ‘"@MCRMetrolink Just seen this. If you witness again can you call straight away on 101. Will try intercept".

The commuter, who travels from Salford to Oldham every day for work, then replied: "@GMPCityCentre @MCRMetrolink will do, didn't think about the 101 number. Not sure how they would have took it as I was near them".

A spokesman from Metrolink, who operate Manchester’s trams, said they were happy for people to report problems via Twitter and said they would have responded if the incident had occurred during their office hours, which they are looking to extend.

A spokesman said: "If the claims being made are proved to be accurate, it's criminal behaviour that has absolutely no place on the network. We will review CCTV footage from the tram and at stops that, together with the picture tweeted, should help police to take action.

‘Our drivers and staff are encouraged to report any anti-social behaviour they witness to build intelligence so that we can work with the police to target areas as required.

‘Incidents like this are incredibly rare. To keep it that way, passengers should report any criminal incidents direct to the police as matter of urgency, and contact our customer services team on 0161 205 2000 so we can support any action required as quickly and effectively as possible.

'Passengers can also use the help points at stops to pass information on.’
