Perched quietly on top of a hill overlooking the Channel, it is what the late Alan Whicker, the veteran broadcaster and TV presenter described as 'my island paradise'. 

Now, a year after the journalist's death, his secluded Jersey home has gone on sale for £4.95million. 

Nestled among pine trees at the top of a winding driveway, the four-bedroom Mont d'Olivet is where Whicker found peace after a lifetime of globe-trotting.

Alan Whicker's beloved Jersey home, Mont d'Olivet, has gone on the market for £4.95million. The property has four bedrooms and a heated outdoor swimming pool  

The house is one of the most secluded on Jersey with three acres of tall pine trees hiding it from view in the nearby valley. Whicker bought the property in 1962

years

With sweeping views towards the Cherbourg peninsula, the 1950s property is described as one of the most secluded in Trinity, Jersey. 

Bought in 1972 by Whicker and his long-term partner, Valerie Kleeman, it was the couple's home until his death last July at the age of 91.

Lush gardens and a tear-drop shaped heated pool are among the property's most coveted features, but it's unrivaled views across the water towards France is what held the TV presenter's life-long adoration.

'He had always been desperate to live near water,' said Ms Kleeman, with whom Whicker shared his life since 1969.

'One of his first childhood memories was of a holiday to Ullswater and he had taken a boat out at dawn. He was around seven or eight-years-old and had been totally enchanted with it. 

'It stayed with him his whole life'.  

Panoramic views of the Channel towards the Cherbourg peninsula  are what captured the journalist's affection after searching for a home that overlooked  water

Alan Whicker was a British broadcaster and TV presenter whose documentary series, Whicker's World, ran for more 30 years. He is pictured with his partner Valerie Kleeman (right) receiving a CBE in the 2005 New Year Honours list 

Set among three acres of woodland, the house is so secluded that only in winter when the trees are bare can its gables be seen from the nearby valley. 

Alan Whicker served with the British Army in Italy in World War II and later became a war correspondent.

He joined the BBC in 1957 with the Tonight program, but soon after launched his Whicker's World series, which made him a household name.

Whicker's World, a documentary program that ran from 1959 to 1990, showed the broadcaster travelling the globe, probing the private worlds of the rich and famous.

He was also the man behind the popular advertising slogan Hello World for Travelocity.

The presenter was given the Richard Dimbleby Award at the 1978 Baftas for his contribution to broadcasting and became a CBE in the 2005 New Year Honours list. 

The quietness the house and island became the perfect refuge for Whicker during a 60-year-career in broadcasting and entertainment.  

'The fact that Jersey was away from England but close to England was what appealed to us, the communications were and are so good,' said Ms Kleeman. 

'Alan was a news junkie so it was important for him to have English newspapers early in the morning and to have the TV channels too.  

'He also felt that if he was too close to London he would always be drawn back to it. He wanted to be in the country but needed to be to be close enough to London.

'He loved this house, he loved this garden and felt very peaceful here. He loved to travel but this was where he loved to come home to.' 

Its three reception rooms and hallways are scattered with photographs of Whicker's illustrious career, including happy portraits of the journalist with Sean Connery, Dudley Moore and Peter Sellers to name a few.

A paved sun terrace leads on to manicured lawns before rows of pine trees. A large study with a plush judge's chair is where he worked tirelessly on a plethora of programmes and scripts, including those for travel his documentary series, Whicker's World. 

'This place is full of wildlife, I have about 20 red squirrels that I've been feeding for 20 years,' adds Ms Kleeman. 

'It really is quite a remarkable place.'

'It became his haven, a place to write and edit Whicker’s World without having to travel further than a flight of stairs, a far cry from the first home of Yorkshire Television, an old shirt factory in Leeds. And he could relax.

'In his study with its wide windows overlooking the garden he could work till all hours every day of the week, distracted only by a sparkling invitation from the pool or the crackling of a log fire upstairs.

'Mont d’Olivet brought happiness and contentment to a man who had been set in his airways.  Hopefully, the next owners will find peace here too.'
