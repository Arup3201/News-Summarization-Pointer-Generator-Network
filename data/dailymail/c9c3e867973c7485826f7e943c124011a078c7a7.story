Mark Cavendish is out of the Tour de France after crashing during the sprint for the line at the end of the opening stage in Harrogate yesterday.

The British rider boarded the team bus to the start of stage two in York this morning but his team, Omega Pharma-Quickstep, have now confirmed the worst fears of cycling fans hoping to see him sprint to glory on The Mall tomorrow after failure to do so at the London Olympics in 2012.

Cavendish suffered 'ligament ruptures with an AC-joint dislocation' between his collarbone and his shoulder after trying 'to find a gap that wasn't there' on Harrogate's Parliament Street.

Had he succeeded in beating German 
Marcel Kittel, it would have been Cavendish's 26th stage win and his 
first opportunity to wear the Tour's yellow jersey.

Instead, the 29-year-old tumbled after colliding with Australian Simon Gerrans.

As it is, his Tour 
ends in disaster after only one stage.

The pain of his injuries means he is no longer able to continue.

'I knew straight away because normally in crashes I bounce back straight away My shoulder was sticking out the way it shouldn't,' Cavendish said on Sunday morning.

'This was the first time in my career that I knew something was up but I wanted to finish and I was able to do that but I was in pain.

'I had some optimism that the swelling would go down overnight but it's not possible from a medical point of view to start today.

'I'm absolutely devastated. Firstly, the Tour is the UK for anther two days and secondly we have an incredible team.'

Cavendish also accepted responsibility for
 the crash, which came as he was pursuing a first yellow jersey of his 
distinguished career in his mother's home town.

'I
 spoke to Simon Gerrans at the finish and then I called him at his hotel
 last night too. We both went for Peter Sagan's wheel but I wanted that 
gap so bad but it wasn't there.

'I hope that Simon is OK and today is a stage for him. He's a good guy and I wish him well for the rest of the Tour. I'm sorry.

'I would have loved to have been here for three weeks as we have a really strong team here but the crash was my fault.'

It
 is the first time since 2008 - when he left prematurely to prepare for 
the Beijing Olympics - that Cavendish will not complete the Tour.

The 2011 points classification winner and world champion won in Paris for four consecutive years from 2009 to 2012.

And
 his withdrawal means just three Britons remain in the race - defending 
champion Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas (Team Sky), and Simon Yates 
(Orica-GreenEdge).
