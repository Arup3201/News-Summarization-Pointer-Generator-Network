A son was today arrested on suspicion of murder after his mother was found dead in their home.

Police were called to a large £350,000 four-bedroom property in Wickford, Essex, at about 10am where they discovered the body of a woman named locally as 46-year-old accountant Tolu Kalejaiye.

Her son, who is aged 21, was arrested shortly after and remained in custody tonight. Neighbours said they had been told the mother was stabbed to death, but it was not confirmed how she died.

Scene: Neighbours of the mother in Wickford, Essex, said they were told she had been stabbed to death

More than 10 of Mrs Kalejaiye’s 
friends and family stood in tears this afternoon outside the family 
home, which remained cordoned off whilst a team of forensic officers 
worked inside the property.

Michael
Day, 57, her neighbour on the quiet road, said: ‘I left my house at 
just gone 9.30am and when I came back 10 minutes later, there was all 
this commotion.

‘People 
were running around on the grass outside on their phones and it was all 
very chaotic. Police cars were quickly on the scene and then the police 
helicopter was overhead.’

Mr
Day described Mrs Kalejaiye as ‘pleasant’, saying that he would only 
usually see her on Sunday mornings when she went to church. ‘She would 
wave when she saw me,’ he added.

According to her Facebook profile, Mrs Kalejaiye is engaged, studied accounting and finance at Middlesex University in Hendon, north London, and is originally from Abeokuta in Nigeria.

'Officers attended and found the body of a woman in her 40s. The death is being treated as suspicious.
