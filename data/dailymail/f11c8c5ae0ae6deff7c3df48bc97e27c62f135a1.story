The fairy-tale story of a lovelorn New Zealander, who ignited a worldwide search to track down an American he'd met once on New Year's Eve, has ground to an abrupt halt, after the girl told him she was 'flattered, but not interested' - though she kept his scarf as a memento.Â 

Reese McKee launched a Facebook campaign last month with a heartfelt plea for help in tracking down the mystery 'Katie' who he met just once on New Year's Eve in Hong Kong.

His plan was successful, but student Katie Capp has now told smitten Mr McKee that she has good memories of the night, but is not interested in a relationship.

Sad: McKee, pictured, found his plan was successful, but student Katie Capp has now told smitten Mr McKee that she has good memories of the night, but is not interested in a relationship

He sent her a heartfelt email, but when she finally replied it was 'lukewarm,' saying only that it was 'a memorable night' for her too.

The heart-breaking note read: 'At any rate, I just wanted to tell you that I'm flattered, but not interested in any relationship or whatever. It was a memorable night and I'd just like to leave it at that.'

However, Ms Capp did admit to keeping a romantic souvenir from the night- the scarf Mr McKee gave her to keep her warm still hangs in her room.

The pair met on New Year's Eve 2012 in Hong Kong. Mr McKee, 25, says he was wandering the city admiring the lights when he saw a girl crying at the side of the road and approached her.

'She was lost. She'd lost all her friends,' he told the New Zealand Herald. 'I just cheered her up. I sort of have this undeniably bad sense of humor that no one can resist laughing at.'

Campaign: On his Facebook campaign page, pictured, McKee explained that the next morning he woke up and discovered the picture on his cell phone 'and the good memories came sweeping back'

The couple spent the night dancing, 
drinking and chatting until 6 a.m., when she reconnected with her 
friends and they parted ways.

Before she vanished into the night, she told him her name and that she lived in 'D.C'. She posed for a photograph and left him with a bold request: 'Find me.'

On his Facebook campaign page, he explained that the next morning he woke up and discovered the picture on his cell phone 'and the good memories came sweeping back.'

But he had few clues to track her down and when he tried to find her email address - he had some recollection of it containing the words 'kitty cat' - he had no luck.

After months looking for her in vain, he launched a heartfelt appeal on Facebook.

Found: The pretty brunette, pictured left and right, tracked down by MailOnline to a small town in the south of France on the Italian border, at first thought she might have feelings for him too

Um no: After thinking it over, the student, pictured, who is taking French classes at a campus of Paris' elite Sciences Po University, decided she didn't feel the same way and rejected his advances

'I was hurt a long time ago,' he wrote. 
'The hopeless romantic in me was locked away when he got hurt because it
 was too much. For too long, this has affected my relationships, and 
I've failed people.

'Somewhere along the line my romantic soul went silent, and this is a step towards putting that right.

'The chances are billions to one, but I like those odds,' he wrote. 'The is me putting all my chips on the table because it's go hard or go home and I am not going to give in.'

He said he had no illusions and that he wouldn't be surprised if Ms Capp had another boyfriend but that he was 'foolishly optimistic.'

Friendly: Mr McKee replied in a friendly way, saying he accepted her decision and just wanted to reconnect and stay in touch. But he later confided: 'I don't think I'll hear from her again'

Hopeful: However, the quirky Kiwi says he is still 'romantically optimistic' Katie, pictured, center, will hahve a change of heart

Revealing she was single she said: 'I haven't made up my mind yet about whether I like him or not. I'm still waiting for him to get in touch.'
