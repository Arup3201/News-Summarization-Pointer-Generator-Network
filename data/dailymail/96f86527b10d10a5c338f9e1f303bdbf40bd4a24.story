Extradited: Former Playboy model Brandi Brandt was extradited to Australia today to face cocaine conspiracy charges

Former Playboy model Brandi Brandt was extradited to Australia today to face cocaine conspiracy charges.

The 45-year-old actress and Playmate of the Month for October 1987 appeared in a Sydney court after her arrival this morning on a flight from the United States.

The former wife of Motley Crue bassist Nikki Sixx did not apply for bail or enter pleas.

She was remanded in custody to appear in court in December.

She is accused of being involved with a cocaine importation syndicate that hid packages of the drug on Qantas and United Airlines passenger planes that flew from California to Sydney.

Employees of an airline catering company allegedly then collected the packages in Sydney.

Court documents filed in Sydney allege that Brandt conspired with others to import a commercial quantity of cocaine between July and December 2007 at Sydney airport.

It is also alleged that California-born Brandt dealt with more than AU$130,000 ($120,000) in proceeds from criminal activity between July and November of the same year.

It is not clear what prison sentence she potentially faces if convicted.

Her former boyfriend, Crusty Demons motorcycle stuntman Rusty Setser, was extradited to Sydney from Los Angeles to face charges over the alleged drug importation last month.

Brandt was also the cover model for the August 1989 issue of Playboy.

On screen: Brandt appeared on the TV show 'Married... with Children' in the early 90s
