Ken Stray, 82, (pictured) has set tongues wagging with his toothless with his toothless dog Toby.

This cheeky little terrier can't help being rude - because his tongue constantly pokes out his mouth after losing all his teeth.

Owner Ken Stray, 82, and his tongue-wagging terrier Toby have become local celebrities in Boston, Lincolnshire., with children stopping them in the street on a daily basis.

The 20-year-old pooch fell out of a van last year and lost all of his teeth meaning he now looks like he is constantly blowing raspberries at passers-by.

Retired Ken, who bought Yorkshire 
terrier Toby up from a puppy at his home in Boston, said today:  'People
think Toby is brilliant- if not a little bit rude with his tongue 
constantly poking out.

'A
lot of dogs will be panting in the heat at the moment but they should 
spare a thought for Toby who always looks like he is panting.'He's so friendly because he's used to children stopping in the street to pet him and ask about him. 'They always come and stroke him and give him loads of fuss. 'I think people feel sorry for him but it is quite funny to see his little tongue sticking out all of the time.

Toby the terrier has been left with his tongue permanently sticking out following an accident which caused him to lose his teeth

'We are pretty inseparable and he's an old boy like me - I just don't go around poking my tongue out at people.

Toby the toothless dog constantly attracts attention thanks to his rare condition

'Everybody loves him though - and he seems to enjoy the attention.'
