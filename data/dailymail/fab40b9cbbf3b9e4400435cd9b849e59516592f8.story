On trial: Captain Francesco Schettino, who was in charge of the cruise ship Costa Concordia when it steered into rocks and sank at the cost of 32 lives

The captain who piloted the cruise ship Costa Concordia onto rocks off Tuscany, killing 32, should serve 26 years in jail, prosecutors said today.

The trial of Captain Francesco Schettino had proved he 'thought only and always about himself,' said prosecutor Maria Navarro in scathing closing statements.

She told the makeshift courthouse in Grosetto that Schettina had lied from the start, never apologised to the victims and saved his own life 'without even getting his shoes wet'.

Calling him a flight risk, she asked the court to detain him again and seize his passport and navigation licence.

Schettino is being tried for manslaughter, causing the shipwreck and abandoning the Concordia while many passengers and crew members were still aboard.

Survivors of the January 13, 2012, wreck described a chaotic and delayed evacuation, with lifeboats unable to lower because the ship was already listing so much.

Ms Navarro said the requested sentence, beyond the 20-year maximum speculated, was not 'exaggerated' considering Italy's high court recently confirmed a 10-year prison sentence for a car accident that killed four people.

The defense is expected to respond in court starting February 9, with a verdict expected thereafter.

Schettino claims he saved lives by steering the liner to shore after it hit uncharted rocks. He accuses his crew of botching his orders and blamed faulty generators aboard the ship for contributing to the disaster.

Defense lawyer Donato Laino was incredulous at the prosecutors' request to re-arrest Schettino, saying the flight risk was 'nonexistent.'

Schettino was granted house arrest soon after the wreck, and later was allowed to remain in his hometown near Naples during the course of the trial. 

He has attended most court sessions, though he was absent today.

Five other Costa Crociere employees indicted in the case were allowed to enter plea bargains and none is serving prison time.
