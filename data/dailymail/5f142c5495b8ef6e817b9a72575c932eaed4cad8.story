If a trip to the art gallery is beyond your means or impossible because of distance, then the National Gallery has the answer.

It is going to give cinemagoers the chance of a detailed view of its paintings along with their popcorn.

The National Gallery has said its major autumn show on Johannes Vermeer, the 17th-century master, will be beamed into cinemas worldwide, using new digital technology able to show the paintings in unprecedented detail.

Available in cinemas worldwide: Paintings such as Johannes Vermeer's The Love Letter from 1670 in London's National Gallery will be shown in 30 countries

Pioneering: Award-winning director Phil Grabsky is turning three major exhibitions into films beginning in April

The pioneering initiative - designed to bring highbrow exhibitions closer to those who live away from major UK cities - will use groundbreaking technology to show the images in incredible detail.

Phil Grabsky, an award-winning British documentary film-maker, says that art is to be seen for the first time with 4K, which is four times clearer than HD.

‘It is completely new. It is being talked about as possibly putting an end to 3D because it’s so powerful.

‘We’ll be the first to film artworks using this technology… People will be see artworks with a quality that was previously totally impossible.’

Its potential is huge, he tells the Daily Mail.

Beyond taking audiences to exhibitions which a huge majority could never otherwise see, it could allow masterpieces like Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel ceiling - which can only be admired from afar - to be seen close up, without a crush of elbows and craned necks.

Grabsky says: ‘I would always urge people to go to a gallery and have direct communication with a painting. But, for the millions who can’t, this is absolutely the next best thing.’

The success of his pilot, which took the National Gallery’s Leonardo exhibition into 1,000 cinemas worldwide, suggests real demand. In Britain alone, it went into 41 cinemas, 39 sold out - and that, even without the new technology.

The Metropolitan Opera, New York, led the way in seeing cinema’s potential.

Its productions are now shown in 1,900 cinemas in 64 countries and, since 2006, have sold 12 million tickets.

Now Grabsky plans to take art into 1,500 cinemas in almost 30 countries.

In Britain, Vermeer will screen in 70 cinemas, including VUE and Picturehouse/ City Screen.

Premiering in October, it will focus on a master whose Girl with a Pearl Earring inspired the acclaimed 2003 film with Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.

Grabsky says that 4K and cinema’s huge screens will reveal secrets of Vermeer’s astonishing technique: 'Anyone who’s looked at a Vermeer thinks ‘how on earth does he do that?'

In April, he will also offer cinema audiences a ‘visit’ to the current Manet exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, and, in June, to Munch at the Oslo National and Munch museums.

However, unlike the Vermeer, they were shot before 4K technology became available.

The films’ presenter is Tim Marlow, renowned art historian and broadcaster.

He says: 'Although there’s no substitute for looking at pictures with the naked eye, you can use a camera to see things in ways you hadn’t known were possible.'

Grabsky, whose previous productions include award-winning history films with Monty Python’s Terry Jones, is now planning further films of major 2014 art exhibitions.

Charles Saumarez Smith, the Royal Academy’s head, says: 'It is exciting that new advances in digital technology will allow an even greater viewing experience for art lovers.'
