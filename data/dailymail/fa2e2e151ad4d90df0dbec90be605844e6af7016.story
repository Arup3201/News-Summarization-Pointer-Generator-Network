France's First Lady, Valerie Trierweiler, is 'fooling herself' by clinging to the hope that her relationship with President Francois Hollande can survive his affair with actress Julie Gayet.

The claim came just hours after Ms Trierweiler left hospital for ‘a bad case of the blues’ following revelations of the affair.

A close friend, who asked not to be named, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She wants to forgive him and believes things can return to the way they were, but it’s impossible.

First lady Valerie Trierweiler left hospital after an eight-night stay having 'taken one too many pills' in the scandal's wake. A close friend says she is 'foolish' to think things can continue as they were

‘Now we have learned this affair was going on even when Hollande took office two years ago, Valerie is fooling herself if she thinks he will return to her.’

The friend said he did not think French public opinion would stand for a straight swap of ‘first girlfriends’ for Hollande, who has always rejected marriage as ‘bourgeois’. ‘I cannot see Julie Gayet moving into the Elysee Palace as a new First Lady.

‘It would look wrong. I think she will continue to live outside as she had her own career as an actress, but perhaps she will appear at the President’s side from time to time and on foreign visits. But first Valerie must be handled, and she won’t go quietly.’

The source has known Ms Trierweiler for 20 years and spoke to her by phone several times during the ten days she spent in the Pitie- Salpetriere hospital, Paris, where Princess Diana died in 1997.

Ms Trierweiler left hospital in an official limousine shortly after 3pm yesterday. Sources at Paris Match, where she has worked since 1989, confirmed she was heading for a property on the Versailles estate to continue her convalescence, as she had requested.

The friend’s comments came as Ms 
Trierweiler’s family spoke for the first time about the affair, with her
 uncle condemning the President’s behaviour as ‘disgraceful’.

Retired
 engineer Florent Massonneau, told The Mail on Sunday from his home in 
Angers, western France: ‘I think the fact my niece is being cuckolded is
 disgraceful. Her situation gives us a lot of pain.’

According
 to some reports, Ms Trierweiler, 48, took pills when 59-year-old 
Hollande broke the bombshell news to her that he had been photographed 
getting a lift on a police bodyguard’s scooter to a flat where he 
enjoyed secret liaisons with blonde mother-of-two Ms Gayet, 41.

The
 next day, France was rocked by the pictures which were  splashed across
 seven pages of the magazine Closer.

Hollande argued that his privacy 
had been invaded, but failed to deny the affair. Ms Gayet has since sued
 Closer for breach of privacy.

Friends of Ms Trierweiler denied suggestions that she had tried to commit suicide by taking an overdose, but admitted she was suffering from stress and exhaustion.

The source who spoke to The Mail on Sunday said Ms Trierweiler had been aware of the rumours linking Hollande and Ms Gayet – but that confirmation of their affair had still come as a huge shock.

‘There are always rumours in French politics that someone is sleeping with someone else,’ said the friend.

‘But when you see photographic evidence, it’s another thing entirely, and it really knocked Valerie sideways. Valerie is a very bright woman but love has made her blind.

She thinks her relationship with Hollande can be patched up, but everyone around her knows it  is beyond repair.’

Plans to hold an Anglo-French summit between David Cameron and Francois Hollande at historic Blenheim Palace have been scrapped – to avoid upsetting the French, writes Brendan Carlin.

The Prime Minister wanted to welcome the French President to the sumptuous 18th Century stately home later this month. 

But the idea has been dropped after Mr Cameron was told that Mr Hollande would regard the choice of venue as a huge insult.

The palace was built as a gift for John Churchill, the 1st Duke of Marlborough and commander of the Allied forces in one of the nation’s greatest victories over ‘old enemy’ France – the Battle of Blenheim in 1704.

The January 31 meeting, which ironically is due to include talks on greater Anglo-French military co-operation, has now been moved to the windswept airfield of RAF Brize Norton.

Blenheim Palace, a World Heritage Site at Woodstock, north of Oxford, was the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill and has an imposing sculpture of an English lion savaging a French cock as a symbol of military triumph.

A well-placed Government source said last night: ‘Cameron came up with the bright idea of staging the meeting at Blenheim. But given what it celebrates, the PM was politely but firmly warned that he would be rubbing Hollande’s nose in it a bit.’

A Tory MP last night added: ‘Maybe Cameron was just feeling a bit sorry for Hollande given all the fuss about his private life.

‘At least tucked away on a military base, he may not have to worry about which First Lady he brings with him.’
