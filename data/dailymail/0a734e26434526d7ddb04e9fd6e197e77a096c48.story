Dead: Paul Andrade, 30, of Hollywood

The bodies of a father and his six-year-old daughter have been discovered inside a minivan.

Paul Andrade, 30, of Hollywood, killed himself, his daughter Amira and their dog through carbon monoxide poisoning, according to police.

The Nissan Quest  was found outside the home of his ex-wife and mother of the child Vicky Paredes early on Thursday morning. 

Andrade and Paredes had broken up about a year ago and she had recently remarried.

The father was upset over that,' Davie Police Capt. Dale Engle said.

Andrade had regular visitation with his daughter, including an overnight visit with the girl Wednesday, police said. 

'It appears that he routinely saw his child,' said Davie Police Capt. Dale Engle.

Two teenagers saw a hose attached to the van and at 6:44 a.m., officers responded to 
the incident in the 3700 block of Northwest 74th Avenue.

One neighbor said she unsuccessfully tried reviving the girl through CPR. 

When police arrived, Mr Engle said, they saw the distraught mother rocking her daughter in her arms.

'I just heard screaming at 6:30 in 
the morning. She was crying for help,' said a neighbor, who preferred 
not to be identified told the Sun Sentinel.

'You could hear the hurt; you could just feel her pain.'

Covered in a white sheet, Andrade's body was removed from the minivan and placed into a coroner's van.

The girl's mother was taken to hospital clutching a soft toy.
