This is the moment former N-Dubz singer Dappy slapped a man in the face for calling him a 'mug'.

The 27-year-old pop star - real name is Dino Costas Contostavlos - can be seen lashing out at clubber George Chittock on the dancefloor at the Chicago Rock Café in Chelmsford, Essex.

He lashed out at Mr Chittock on February 27 this year, and says the man called him names.

In an assault trial at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court which ended today he called the trial a 'stitch-up' - but was found guilty and ordered to pay an £800 fine.

Dappy held his head in his hands today he was found guilty of assault by beating.

Closing the prosecution case today, Jacqueline Carey told the court: 'Whether Mr Chittock called this defendant a mug is neither here nor there.

'You may think what he is really saying is that he was provoked - provocation is no defence.

'It is no defence for anybody, celebrity or otherwise, to say "I lashed out because he was rude to me".

'It is not reasonable to slap somebody when surrounded by bodyguards because somebody says to you "Oi, what?".'

Ms Carey told the court the pair were in a smoking area along with Contostavlos’s minder and two of the club’s own door staff at about 2am when he was seen to slap Mr Chittock.

The incident was caught on CCTV.

Witnesses claimed Contostavlos had consumed half of bottle of vodka that night.

Chair of the bench Angela Tucker said the magistrates had found Contostavlos was not under any physical threat at the time of the incident.

There was 
no sign of his friend and fellow Celebrity Big Brother housemate Jim 
Davidson, who arrived at court yesterday in a show of moral support.

Davidson claimed he had offered his services as a character witness but the defence team declined.

The court was read details of Contostavlos's criminal record, including a six-month suspended sentence for affray and assault in February 2012.

A trial last year heard how he spat at Grace Cochran and Serena Burton, who were both 19, at a filling station in Guildford.

Mitigating today, Mr Harrison said: 'It was no doubt a regrettable incident but one that was over very quickly and left a person red-faced and very, very angry.

'He is a polarising figure who is clearly liked by a great many people but he is equally disliked by many others.'

Referring to his client's ability to pay a fine or compensation, he said his client is well paid but his earnings are sporadic and he is currently awaiting a five-figure payment.

But he added that Contostavlos's finances were limited by a recent tax settlement. Magistrates retired to consider sentencing.

Earlier in the trial Jon Harrison, defending, said: 'The real question in this trial is can you be sure that when the defendant turned round that he did not believe he may be attacked?

'In that split second, is there really time to draw the attention of security officers?

'This is a man who regularly makes public appearances and is surrounded by people.

'He’s not somebody who believes every single person wants to do him harm.'

Scene: The assault took place at Chicago Rock Cafe in Chelmsford, Essex

In a police statement read to the court, the performer said he had been 'cut' in an incident four or five years earlier at a nightclub in Nottingham.

Asked if he feared he was going to be stabbed on the night of the incident, he added: 'Yeah of course, I’m always concerned about that.

'I was scared someone was going to put a hole in me.'

During cross-examination, the performer said he was 'a million per cent' sure that it was Mr Chittock who called him a 'mug'.

'It was a violation,' he said. 'Tesco, Asda, everywhere I go, there’s always one person to make a rude remark. This is a stitch-up. This is what’s happening in this case.'

Dappy did not comment as he left court but made a hand gesture to fans before climbing into a black Audi with tinted windows and driving away.

N-Dubz band members appear to have entered a downward spiral since they split up in September 2011, facing an array of legal, financial and professional problems.

Dappy's conviction for assault today still leaves a host of claims and charges against N-Dubz members to be resolved in the courts.

Fellow member and former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos is currently awaiting the result of her own assault trial, in which she is accused of punching a gossip writer who used his website to publicise a sex tape of her.

A hearing - also at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court –  was told she boasted of being 'worth £10million' and said she  'knew gangsters and people from the streets' before launching a vicious attack on Savvas Morgan, 26.

The case has been adjourned until July 2 while more witnesses are called.

Separately, she is waiting for the start of a drugs trial in London. She is charged with helping a Sun journalist obtain half an ounce (14.2g) of cocaine for £860.

She will face the charges at a trial which begins at Southwark Crown Court on July 14. She had denied the charges previously, but has yet to enter a formal plea.

Fazer, the third member, was declared bankrupt at the end of 2013.

It later emerged that his girlfriend Ashley-Emma Havelin, with whom he as a young daughter, had turned to filming pornography to make ends meet.

In January this year she was working for Studio 66, which hosts late-night phone-ins. But she defended her work, saying: ‘Glamour gets a bad rep, I don't get what the major issue is. I'm not a slag.’

It is not known how much the singer – real name Richard Rawson – owes HMRC.

Dappy himself came close to bankruptcy this year – but escaped after paying £140,000 to HMRC in February.

He has also experience professional trouble. Earlier this week he stormed off stage ten minutes early while performing at the Isle of Wight festival.

The singer later complained of ‘low energy’ from his audience, who booed him after he turned up 15 minutes late for the start of the performance.
