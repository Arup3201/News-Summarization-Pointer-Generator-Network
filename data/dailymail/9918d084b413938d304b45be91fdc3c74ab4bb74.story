In cash-strapped times, fashion conscious women must resort to ever more creative measures in order to continue looking their best.

And these days a favourite trick is painting the soles of high-street shoes red in order to make them resemble those by celebrity designer Christian Louboutin.

Paint it red: All of the shoes sold by French shoe designer Christian Louboutin have the bright scarlet shade of Pantone-18 Chinese Red painted on their soles

The French shoemaker, whose signature is the bright Pantone-18 Chinese Red paint emblazoned on the sole of his every creation, is a favourite among 
celebrities including Victoria Beckham, Misha Barton, Blake Lively and 
Coleen Rooney.

The designer originally added the red sole at the last minute during a fashion show when he decided his shoes needed more 'energy', and painted them with an assistant's nail varnish.

But instead of forking out an average of £600 per pair, money-conscious consumers are now buying cheap shoes and tester pots of bright red paint.

Homewares company Homebase have reported that sales of Home of Colour tester pots of shocking red colours Flame 
and Show Stopper have shot up by 40 per cent year-on-year this week, as 
savvy customers have been looking to recreate their own Louboutins at a snip 
of the price of the iconic, red-soled designer shoes.

Claire Stevenson, 24, a PA from Croydon,
wanted her dream pair of Louboutins to wear to her cousin's wedding so confessed to using the DIY trick.

She said: 'There was no way I could afford to buy a pair of Louboutin 
heels, but I had my heart set on them and felt the pressure to be 
fashionable at the occasion.

'I bought a £20 pair of plain black shoes and a tester pot and recreated the designer look at home. I carefully painted the soles, let them dry overnight, and by the next day they were ready to wear.

'I received so many compliments at the wedding about my gorgeous shoes 
but I didn't have the heart to confess they were DIY fakes.

'It was such a success I plan on doing the same for another pair of heels.'

Homebase store manager Peter Rooney at London's Acton 
branch said: 'While many people tend to look at magazines to get the
right paint colour for walls, we have recently noticed a significant 
number of girls in the store colour-matching the tester pots to pictures
of designer shoes in fashion magazines and requesting tips on how to 
paint on leather or rubber.'

And if you're looking to get that DIY 
fashion look, Homebase has provided some handy top tips to get you 
started - Richard Johnson, senior paint buyer at Homebase has provided 
his advice for achieving the Louboutin look at home.

He said: '“Clearly paint is meant for decorating walls rather than shoes, so we are amazed at this new trend that has hit our stores. The tester pots would have enough paint to cover the sole of an average sized shoe, but we would advise people to ensure they do apply it properly so it can achieve a really good visual effect.".'

Fancy footwear: Christian Louboutin's shoes sell for an average of £600 per pair

Louboutin is very fond of his red-soled trademark and sued Spanish 
brand Zara in 2008, claiming that an open- toed red-soled shoe the shop was 
selling for £40 was similar to his Yo Yo style.

But a French court ruled Zara’s cut-price shoe could not be 
confused with that made by the high-end designer, and last month the Cour 
de Cassation – the final court of appeal – upheld the decision.

Last year Louboutin accused designer Yves Saint Laurent of copying 
his celebrated red-soled footwear when he used a similar theme in his 
2011 resort collection.

That lawsuit resulted in a high-court appeal case in the US, the verdict of which is yet to be decided.

1. Cover the rest of the shoe while painting to avoid unwanted marks on the main body of the shoe

2. Use a thin, small brush to keep painting accurate and neat

3. Prime the sole of the shoe with multi-purpose primer

4. Paint with a gloss rather than an emulsion paint

5. Use Homebase’s Home of Colour Flame or Show Stopper paints for the best colour match

6. Seal the colour with a surface sealer for a longer lasting finish
