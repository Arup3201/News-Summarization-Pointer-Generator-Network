A Stark Trek fan has a message for humanity: Can we boldly go where no man has gone before - and build a fully-functioning Starship Enterprise?

Visit BuildTheEnterprise.org, and you may believe you have stumbled upon the blueprints of a NASA-funded project, so complete and fully-fledged are the blueprints.

Every detail of the first Enterprise has been planned out to the smallest degree, from the inner workings of the 'gravity wheel' to the coverings on the exterior shielding, as well as the outline of the first ten missions and the political problems that will have to be overcome. 

Naturally, there are some differences:
 Captain Kirk and his crew explored the universe in 2250 or thereabouts,
 and the increase in technology advances gives Kirk and co a distinct 
advantage, such as warp drives powered by anti-matter and teleportation 
devices.

Still, 'Dan' a systems engineer whose 
job involves trialling new technologies, believes we can build his model
 within the next 20 years  and it can then be a vessel for humanity, 
using nuclear generators to take us to the moon in three days and to 
Mars in 90 days.

The Khan-do spirit: Systems engineer 'Dan' has methodically worked out any kinks to get the Enterprise in the skies

The ship - otherwise known as the NCC-1701 - is a faithful - and more
 importantly, a technically possible, recreation of of the biggest shows
 in Sci-Fi history.

However, as creator 'Dan' points out, 'many changes are needed inside the Gen1 ship to make the ship 
compatible with the technologies of the first half of the 21st
 century.

'Keep in mind that the Star Trek adventures in the 
NCC-1701-x Enterprise ships take place starting in the year 2245. Our 
technology today is just not up to building a starship - that will have 
to wait for a Gen4 ship or later.

But this doesn’t mean that the Gen1
 Enterprise will not be awe-inspiring and similar in many fundamental 
ways to the Enterprises of the future.'

He added: 'The Gen1 Enterprise will be 
the same size as future Enterprises or larger. It will have 1g gravity 
like the future ships and ample comfortable living space. It will have a
 bridge with 1g gravity where the captain and key crew members will 
often work.

'It will have a huge number of sensors for probing 
whatever the ship encounters in space. It can launch landers that 
descend to a planet below and then return to the ship. It will move 
beyond the brute-force rocket engines of the 20th century by using ion 
propulsion engines powered by on-board nuclear reactors.

'Yes, this may still be a long way from warp drives powered by anti-matter, but it will be a respectable start.'

Ready for construction: Build the Enterprise even goes into great detail about each area of the ship, breaking down what modern-day technology can be adapted to boldly go into space

More than an Eiffel, or a World Trade Centre: The Enterprise would be one of the most ambitious projects built on this planet (or off it)

Bold plans: The full plans to build a real-life USS Enterprise is laid out online

Dan continued: 'Things
 get moved around and reworked quite a bit inside the Gen1 Enterprise 
compared to the Enterprises of Star Trek. For example, in the NCC-1701-x
 ships the hanger deck is located in the back of the lower hull and this
 serves as the launch and entry port for shuttlecrafts.

'But in the 
Gen1 Enterprise this lower hull section instead houses the main engine 
and main nuclear reactor. For the Gen1 ship, the spaceport entry doors 
are on the underside of the saucer hull.

'The reason for this is that
 in the Gen1 Enterprise every bit of the three hull sections to the rear
 of the Enterprise are needed to house the three engines and nuclear 
reactors that will be needed to provide enough power to move the massive
 ship with the required .002g constant acceleration.

'Another example
 of a change is that the bridge is not at the top center of the saucer 
hull as it is shown in the figure above. If it was there in the Gen1 
Enterprise then there would be no gravity on the bridge. Having the 
ship’s captain and crew floating around inside the bridge just makes no 
sense. Thus, in the Gen1 Enterprise the bridge is in a dedicated section
 of the gravity wheel so that they will work in 1g gravity.

'While 
things get moved around quite a bit inside the Gen1 Enterprise when 
compared to the ships from Star Trek, they are not moved around upon a 
whim. They are moved around because the Gen1 ship’s technological 
capabilities demand certain changes.'

Boldly going forward: Captain James T Kirk (William Shatner) leads his Enterprise crew on another mission

Dan,
 who is behind the project, seems qualified for the role, and hopes that
 even if his project doesn't - excuse the pun - get off the ground, his 
project will inspire The Next Generation.

On
 his website he states: 'In my day job I work as a systems engineer and 
electrical engineer. For 30 years I have worked at the same Fortune 500 
company, a company that is a high-tech leader in the US and globally.

'I’m
 lucky that in my role I often get to explore new ideas and new 
technologies when working toward the development of new products. The 
BuildTheEnterprise website just seems to flow out naturally from the 
same approach I take in pondering and evaluating new ideas and 
technologies in my day job.

'Personally,
 I have found working as an engineer to be very rewarding. The work is 
interesting, the pay is good, your co-workers are bright and 
enthusiastic, and the unemployment rate in engineering typically runs 
under 3 per cent – far below the national average for all workers. For 
these reasons I hope that some young people find a bit of inspiration in
 this website, and that this might even help motivate some to study 
engineering in college.

'And
 okay, for the record, while in grade school I watched the first Star 
Trek series each week during the original season on TV in 1966 on my 
family’s black and white TV.

'Captivated
 by the image and idea of the USS Enterprise, I built a long lost model 
of it from a kit I purchased at a store. I was around nine years old. So
 I suppose the USS Enterprise has been burned into my brain for a long 
time, just waiting for a chance to get out.'
