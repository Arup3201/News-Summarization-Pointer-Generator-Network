A man convicted of inflicting sadistic 'torture sessions' on his girlfriend's three-year-old son before fleeing with her to a Florida theme park, has been jailed for 67 years.

Roland Dow, 28, from Plaistow, New Hampshire, was sentenced yesterday for burning, blinding and treating James Nicholson, who is now lame, 'like a caged animal'. 

He was convicted in June of assaulting the toddler, failing to get him medical help, coaching him to lie to a social worker and secretly recording the social worker's visit.

The young boy is the son of Dow's girlfriend, Jessica Linscott, who pleaded guilty to child endangerment and witness tampering.

She will be serving between two and seven years in prison.

They were arrested at the Universal Orlando Resort in November 2012, two weeks after leaving James at a hospital with a brain injury, head-to-toe bruises and burns on his arm and hand.

The brain injury was so severe that holes had to be drilled in his head to relieve pressure on his skull.

Prosecutors said Dow treated the boy like a dog, not allowing him to sit on the couch and refusing to have the child's laundry mixed with his.

Rockingham County Superior Court, New Hampshire, also heard how the boy was made to sleep in the shower without a blanket or pillow and was verbally and physically abused.

Judge Marguerite Wageling called Dow's behaviour deliberate, depraved and sadistic, saying that the young boy had been 'dragged into hell'.

She said: 'James was treated like a caged animal, and putting that up against the apparent wonderful behaviour he knew how to provide to a child makes it even more sick.

'He then flew out of the area and engaged in happy-go-lucky entertainment while James lay in a hospital bed having holes drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure of the injuries he sustained.'

Assistant County Attorney Patricia Conway said Dow beat the boy, tied him to a bed and subjected him to 'torture sessions' in the bathroom.

'For whatever reason, God only knows, this man hated James. He hated him, and he began his reign of terror against this 3-year-old little toddler,' said Ms Conway.

While the child was in the hospital, Dow and Linscott went to Florida, where they partied and went to amusement parks, according to prosecutors.

In arguing for a sentence of five to 10 years, attorney Thomas Gleason said his client was 'sorry the young boy was injured and hurt'.

James, who is now five-years-old, lives with his grandmother and is 'doing great' physically.

His  great-grandmother Germaine Mullen said the boy remains terrified of Dow and has asked: 'Why did Roland hurt me all the time?'

She said she has assured James that Dow is in prison.

'The look of relief that came over that child's face? It was almost like when someone wins the lottery,' she said.

Dow, who didn't testify at his trial, didn't speak at the sentencing either.
