A young woman was so desperate to find the father of her unborn son that she posted an ad on Gumtree with unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers.

Bianca Fazey, 24, had a one night stand with a man in Perth, Western Australia on April 23 this year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome.

For five months, Bianca frantically searched for the father but had no luck as she only knew his first name and what suburb he lived in.

'I was at my wits end,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I tried finding him for months and felt pressured by a friend who was adamant I don't give up despite exhausting all avenues.'

Bianca Fazey posted a Gumtree ad in an attempt to find her unborn son's father

Bianca's ad received a barrage of hateful remarks from complete strangers

This was when Bianca, who was so stressed that she was losing sleep, decided to post an ad on Gumtree which created a barrage of hateful responses prompting her to take to take it down.

'I stupidly put it up thinking no one would even see it but who knows what will happen, maybe I will get lucky,' she said. 

'Unfortunately all I got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be Jeremy.' 

The most offensive messages were from people saying that Bianca, who is due in mid January, should have opted for a termination.

'When it was shared on the LAD bible page a lot of people made single-minded comments aimed at me, no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant,' she said.

'Sometimes I want to be like one of those people on Maury Povich screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they're booing about!' 

Bianca was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby

Bianca wasn't exactly shocked to be called names like a 'sl**' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying 'kill it'.

'It was sad to see people saying I should get an abortion, those were the only comments that hurt.' 

'Society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship,' she said.

'I was more mad at the amount of women (mums included) saying I shouldn't go through with it.'

But Bianca has risen above the horrendous backlash and can't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months.

'All I can say is I chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because I didn't think I could have children,' she said. 

'Even though I knew this guy had disappeared I didn't want to give up my chance and I'm so grateful I didn't.'

Despite the fall-out from the ad - Bianca has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends.

'It has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person,' she said.

'I couldn't be happier, I am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment.' 

She is also looking forward to getting back into shape 

'Excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape!' she said.

'I hate that I'm so limited physically.'

Bianca still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son's life.

'I do hope that I can find him and let him know, he can make his own choice,' she said. 

'But more for the sake of the kid, when he asks questions or wants to find him I want to be prepared.'
