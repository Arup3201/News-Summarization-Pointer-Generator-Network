Traffic police in China stopped a motorist after he was spotted driving along a highway with a medical drip hanging out of the car.

Businessman Gang Fang, 38, was seen at the wheel of his car in Chinaâ€™s Jiangsu province with a bag of fluid suspended above his head and a tube leading into his arm.

Witness Li Lung watched the scene as the driver was pulled over by police.

He told local media: 'The man was pulled over by police. He said he had been suffering a lot of stress at work recently.

'He went to the hospital and they'd told him to take time off work and lie down. But he said he didn't have the time.

'So they apparently gave him medicine to give him energy in the form of a drip.

'I heard him say: "I didn't know I was doing anything wrong".'

A police spokesman said: 'This is incredibly dangerous.

'Not only was he taking medicines that could have affected his driving directly into a vein, he was unable to move his arm to steer properly because he would have ripped the tube out.'

The bag was placed on a stand behind his seat as he drove along and was poking out of the sunroof

He complained that he had not had the time to wait in the hospital.
