British refugee worker John Stiles, 52, has been missing in Russia's Northern Caucasus mountains for a week

Fears are growing for a British refugee worker after he went missing on a hike in the North Caucasus mountains.

John Stiles, a University of York graduate who was head of the Danish Refugee Council's North Caucasus branch, went missing on November 10.

The 52-year-old disappeared after going on a one-day hike in the mountains near Fiagdon River, in Russiaâ€™s Ossetia Republic.

The skilled climber has not been seen since, and with heavy snow forecast for later this week, hopes of finding him alive are dwindling.

Despite launching a rescue investigation almost immediately, Russian security officials have since refused to comment on how the operation is going, what the next step is and what the chances are of finding Stiles.

Last week a spokesman for the Refugee Council said: 'It seems likely that John has had a climbing accident.'

The temperature in Ossetia is currently 40F (4C) and is expected to rise
slightly in the next few days before dropping to freezing overnight on 
Monday.

The North Caucasus is also the site of a militant Islamist insurgency in the self-proclaimed Caucasus Emirate, fuelling speculation that Stiles may have been caught up in fighting.

However the possibility seems unlikely given that trouble has not yet spread to the predominantly Christian south, near Ossetia.

The Danish Refugee Council - one of the largest humanitarian organizations working in the North Caucasus in the field of refugee rights - is a regional partner of the United Nations.

The weather in the Northern Caucasus is expected to deteriorate later this week, with heavy snow forecast reducing the chances of finding Mr Stiles (file picture)
