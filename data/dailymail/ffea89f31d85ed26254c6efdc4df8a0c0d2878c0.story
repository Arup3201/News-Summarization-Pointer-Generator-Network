This daring athlete is pictured testing out a new extreme sport - riding mammoth 30ft waves on a pair of water skis.

Chuck Patterson is believed to be the first person to ever attempt wave skiing and he seems to have perfected the sport already.

In contrast to water skiing, where you are always towed along by a motorboat, wave skiers are released at the peak of a wave to ski 'freestyle'.

World first: Chuck Patterson is thought to be the first person to ever attempt wave skiing - riding waves on a pair of skis with poles

In action: Chuck Patterson is pictured riding huge waves up to 30ft high at an offshore reef near Santa Barbara, California, America

After letting go of the rope from the jet ski, Patterson can reach speeds up to 30mph as he rides the huge waves.

Photographer Greg Huglin captured these incredible images of Patterson catching huge waves at an offshore reef near Santa Barbara, California, America.

Patterson, who is already at professional level in orthodox skiing and surfing, even uses ski poles when wave skiing.

The poles are of no real use in the water except to help him maintain the same balance and positioning as he would when skiing on snow.

He has also had a pair of custom made skis to use which are a combination of water skis and the skis used on snow.

The extreme athlete, 43, who lives in California, said: 'The unpredictability of the water is what makes wave skiing so difficult.

'The sport feels similar to skiing on snow in warm temperatures when the snow is soft.

Dedicated: Photographer Greg Huglin went to great lengths to secure these astonishing images - taking pictures from helicopters, boats and the shoreline

Challenging: Chuck Patterson is released by the motorboat at high speeds on to the crest of the wave which he can then ski

'You have got to have knowledge of the ocean and the energy of the water to be able to do it.

'The feeling when you drop in off a wave is a bit sketchy at first just because you're going so fast.

'I
don't think there is anyone else in the world doing it but for me it is
just a bit of fun alongside my surfing and snow skiing.

'I've
tried it without the ski poles and it felt very strange - they help me 
with balance and keeping my body in the correct position.'

Mr Huglin also put together a composition of shots to help show how Patterson catches the waves on a pair of skis.

The
photographer will shoot from a variety of places, including on board a 
helicopter, on a boat or on the shore, to get the best pictures.

Mr Huglin, 60, from California, said: 'What Chuck is doing is unique and I don't know of anyone anywhere who can do this on waves.

'I think he has invented a new sport and I believe he will ride larger and larger waves on his skis and perfect the technique.

'It is pretty ridiculous how good he is and I think he is capable of dropping in off waves as big as 50ft tall.

'I've been photographing Chuck for eight years now and you can't help but like the guy, he is such a tremendous athlete too.

'Wave skiing is pretty dangerous as you are travelling at such a speed - you have to be a pro surfer as well as pro skier to have the ability to do it.

'To imagine how difficult it is, I think you would have to compare it to skiing in an avalanche.

'I really enjoy filming him catching the large waves but I'm not at all tempted to risk my life doing it!'
