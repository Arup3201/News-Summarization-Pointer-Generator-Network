Cristiano Ronaldo has handed Real Madrid a massive boost ahead of the Champions League final by returning to training just hours after sustaining a hamstring injury.

The Portuguese was forced off after just eight minutes of Real's 1-1 draw with Real Valladolid on Wednesday evening and there had been fears that he would miss the final against city rivals Atletico on May 24.

Ronaldo, who has scored 50 goals this season, had been pictured holding his left leg and talking to boss Carlo Ancelotti during a training session on Tuesday.

But he was back on the training field on Thursday as Real limber up for their La Liga match at Celta Vigo on Sunday, where they will try to keep their slender title hopes alive.

Setback: Ronaldo was replaced by striker Alvaro Morata against Real Valladolid on Wednesday

The decision to risk him just 17 days before the Champions League final appeared to have backfired as he limped off against Real Valladolid.

Ronaldo's team-mate Gareth Bale had earlier been ruled out of the game because of injury.

Ronaldo came off in the eighth minute at 
the Jose Zorilla Stadium without showing any clear signs of being in 
pain, just moments after his long run through the opponent's half came 
to an end when he clashed with a defender.

Real Madrid took the lead after a 
stunning Sergio Ramos free-kick but saw their title hopes suffer a 
devastating blow after Humberto Osorio grabbed a late equaliser for 
second-from-bottom Valladolid.

The Portugal international had recently been troubled by a knee and muscle injury in his left leg, but had returned to play in Madrid's Champions League semi-final triumph over Bayern Munich.

Ronaldo has scored 50 goals this season in all competitions, including a league-leading 31 goals.
