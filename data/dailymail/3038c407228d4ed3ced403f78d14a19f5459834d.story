It's still three days until Halloween, but the two most popular costumes have already been determined: Miley Cyrus's VMAs twerking outfit, and the little yellow minions from Despicable Me.

According to the New York Daily News, 'Minion costume' was the number one Halloween-related Google search this month, followed by 'Miley Cyrus costume'.

While the Wrecking Ball singer's teddy bear costume that she donned at the VMAs has proved a hit for some, others have opted to replicate her skin-colored bikini that she wore underneath.

Top costumes: 'Miley Cyrus costume' was the second most popular Halloween-related Google search this month, behind 'Minion costume', in reference to the creatures from Despicable Me

Viral: Indeed, an adult-sized 'Twerkin Teddy' costume on Spirithalloween.com has already been sold out

Not only were Miley Cyrus's controversial get-ups a top hit in Google searches, but they were also the fifth most-searched costumes on Google Shopping.

Indeed, an adult-sized 'Twerkin Teddy' costume on Spirithalloween.com has already been sold out as of today.

Evidently the more PG choice, Despicable Me's minions are a costume for children and adults alike, with a number of people looking to DIY videos for inspiration.

The little yellow creatures have seen a surge in popularity recently thanks to the success of Despicable Me 2, which hit theaters in July.

Having a wrecking ball: Among the Miley Cyris fans is Paris Hilton, who attended a party in Los Angeles on Saturday in the same grey teddy bear bodysuit that caused such a stir when Miley debuted it at the VMAs

Among the Miley Cyris fans is Paris Hilton, who attended a party in Los Angeles on Saturday in the same grey teddy bear bodysuit that caused such a stir when Miley debuted it at the VMAs.

She
 wore her blonde hair in two pigtail bunches, and accessorized her 
eye-catching outfit with a pair of red heart-shaped sunglasses.

Instead of platform light-up sneakers, however, the 32-year-old heiress opted for silver stilettos to complete her look.

Famous pair: Crystal Harris opted for a beige bodysuit rather than a two-piece for her Miley look, which she coordinated with husband Hugh Hefner's Robin Thicke costume

Miley with a twist: Instead of stripping down to a bra and underwear to accurately copy Miley's skin-colored look, Joan Rivers donned a fat suit and an attachable tongue hanging out of her mouth

Joan Rivers and Hugh Hefner's wife 
Crystal Harris took their Miley Cyrus-themed costumes one step further -
 though neither were quite as revealing as the real deal.

Instead of stripping down to a bra and underwear to accurately copy Miley's skin-colored look, the 80-year-old 
comedienne donned a fat suit and an attachable tongue hanging out of her
 mouth.

She
 coordinated her ensemble with her 82-year-old husband, who was dressed 
in a black-and-white striped suit as a tribute to Robin Thicke.

The
 second and fourth most popular Google Shopping searches were for 
costumes related to two top TV shows - AMC's Breaking Bad and A&E's 
Duck Dynasty.

And thanks to techno music group 
Ylvis's viral song What Does the Fox Say, fox costumes are also on the 
rise, ranking third in the top Google Shopping searches.

While
 many will choose to replicate Miley Cyrus' VMAs outfit for Halloween, 
there is one person who is evidently steering clear of the popular 
costume: Eiza Gonzalez.

The
 23-year-old actress - and Liam Helmsworth's rumored new girlfriend - 
was pictured on Friday giggling at a Miley-themed costume behind the 
window of a store in West Hollywood.
