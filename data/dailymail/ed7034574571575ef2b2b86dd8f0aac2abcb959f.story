Simon Pierce grew up besotted with wildlife and not even a terrifying one-on-one encounter with a great white shark on his first solo dive could deter him from his passion of underwater photography. 

The 35-year-old 'scientist with a camera' is leading a global whale shark research project, showcasing nature's beauty in his spectacular underwater photography and documenting his mission to save some of the most beautiful creatures on the planet.

Pierce learned to scuba dive at university and instantly fell in love with what lies beneath the ocean, travelling the world to encounter remarkable species and highlighting their plight in his series of impressive snapshots.

Simon Pierce grew up besotted with wildlife and and now spends a lot of his time with whale sharks, the largest fish in the sea

By the age of five, the New Zealand native was planning to become a marine biologist and after completing a a BSc in ecology and a PhD in marine biology, he is now living out his dream as the Principal Scientist at the Marine Megafauna Foundation. 

'I was trying to decide whether to focus my postgraduate research on land animals or marine creatures, and then my mother got me a dive trip on the Great Barrier Reef for my birthday,'  he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'It was spectacular: beautiful reefs, fantastic scenery and amazing animals like sharks and whales.

'I was trying to decide whether to focus my postgraduate research on land animals or marine creatures, and then my mother got me a dive trip on the Great Barrier Reef for my birthday,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's a different world underwater, one that will always be slightly alien to us. I love it.' he said

With such an extreme passion, there obviously comes some danger and Pierce is not stranger to that. While on his fist solo dive, the marine-mad photographer came face-to-face with a Great White Shark. 

As circumstances would have it, he was the only person that day who could service some equipment at depth and encountered the king of the ocean while as a massive depth. 

'It's a different world underwater, one that will always be slightly alien to us. I love it.' Pierce said. 

The scientist loves marine iguanas and claims Charles Darwin didn't 'get' the animal when he labelled them 'imps of darkness' 

Pierce was lucky enough to dive with the prehistoric looking marine iguanas when he was visiting the Galapagos 

The marine biologist and talented photographer took this picture of a manta ray while he was in Nusa Penida in Indonesia 

'I did the job easily, looked up... and there was a great white shark in front of me! It swam past without incident, but it's presence was definitely weighing on my mind as I ascended through the dark, murky water,' he said. 

Whale sharks are his weak point, as he discussed the mammoth creatures with fascination and admiration.  

While studying for his PhD, Pierce was asked by his friend in Africa to visit Mozambique, to take a look at the whale sharks there. He was instantly enthralled by the slow-moving sea creatures and has been working with the species ever since.

The stunning whale sharks are one of the largest creatures in the ocean and Pierce has an unbelievable way to showcase their beauty with his camera 

He now leads a global research program on whale sharks, as he aims to take effective action to protect the largest known extant fish species

'They are so huge, but they're completely harmless to people,' he said, explaining how misunderstood the creatures are.

'They have so many different behaviours, I find them totally fascinating. I'll never get tired of photographing them.' 

Pierce dives with whale sharks in the hope of discovering a way to preserve the gigantic sea creature and the small population of pups 

According to Pierce, there are only about thirty whale shark pups in the world. The babies, which are less than a metre long, have never been seen in the wild

In the incredible images below, two whale sharks are set free by divers Chris Rohner and Clare Prebble. 

The 8m long adult and a smaller 5m fish became tangled in nets off Mafia Island in Tanzania. The whales then swim alongside the divers to thank them for their help.

While not a lot if known about the species, such as where the females or adults live, Pierce believes these questions need to be answered as soon as possible. 

'These gentle, placid giants are globally threatened by overfishing, accidental catches, and ship strikes. There's a good chance that the species won't survive if we don't actively help them,' he said.

His work in preserving whale sharks has lead him to some of the most beautiful destinations in the world and while Australia's famous Great Barrier Reef makes an appearance in his list of top five places to dive in the world, he admits that the Galapagos Islands are unrivalled when it comes to nature. 

The mammoth whale sharks, who swam into the nets, looked like they were being chocked by the fisherman's net as they desperately tried to get out 

There were two sharks in the net - one 8m long adult and a smaller 5m fish -  during the dive, which took place in November

The divers came to the aid of the  whale sharks who had become tangled in the gigantic fishing nets

Eventually, the whale sharks were set free and followed the divers to thank them. The whole thing was caught on camera by Simon Pierce

'The top places I have dived are the Galapagos Islands, southern Mozambique, the outer Great Barrier Reef, South Africa and Tanzania,' he said.

'I love big animals - sharks, sea turtles, whales - and these places all have plenty of wildlife.'

'I visited the Galapagos Islands for the first time this year. I had wanted to go there my whole life, but the reality still exceeded my imagination.

'I saw gigantic, pregnant whale sharks swimming through schools of hundreds of hammerhead sharks, dived with the marine iguanas and giant ocean sunfish, watched orca hunting and that's aside from all the fascinating life on land. It's a once in a lifetime trip, but I definitely plan to go back.' he said.
