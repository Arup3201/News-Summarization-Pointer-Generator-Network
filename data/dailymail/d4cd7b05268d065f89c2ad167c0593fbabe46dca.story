Britain’s top politicians are not as well-known as they might like to think.

A damning new poll reveals the public cannot correctly name most of the Cabinet or party leaders – with hilarious results.

Labour leader Ed Miliband suffers the indignity of being mixed up with Bert from Sesame Street while Chancellor George Osborne is confused with Hollywood actor Tom Hanks and Home Secretary Theresa May is mistaken for comedian Sarah Millican.

Muppet: Only 77 per cent of people could name Ed
Miliband (left) with most confusing him with brother David, and some 
thinking he was Bert from Sesame Street (right)

Recognition: David Cameron received a boost from the poll which showed 94 per cent of people correctly identified him, but it was only just ahead of his rival Boris Johnson who had 91 per cent recognition

Pollsters gave more than 8,000 people 
photographs of 10 of the country’s most high profile politicians and 
asked them to name them.

David Cameron was recognised by an impressive 96 per cent of people, with 94 per cent able to name him.

Pollster
Lord Ashcroft said: ‘This is as close to a unanimous response as you 
get in political research, but still means that more than one in twenty 
of our fellow countrymen and women could in theory bump into David 
Cameron and not be at all sure who he was.

‘This
ought to be a salutary thought for those in the political world who 
imagine that the rest of the electorate follow events in Westminster as 
closely as they do.’

But in a worrying sign for the Prime Minister, his great rival Boris Johnson was almost as well known.

The Mayor of London’s appeal stretches beyond the capital, recognised by 94 per cent of people.

It means he was as well-known as the Foreign Secretary, Health Secretary and the Defence Secretary put together.

Hollywood: Chancellor George Osborne (left) was correctly named by just 62 per cent of people, with the rest muddling him up with Ed Miliband and actor Tom Hanks (right)

But the results were less reassuring for the other big beasts of Westminster.

Eighty-nine
per cent of people said they thought they knew who Labour leader Mr 
Miliband was – but only 77 per cent got it right.

Two
and a half years after his surprise victory in Labour’s leadership 
contest, Mr Miliband is still most often confused with his brother 
David.

Humiliatingly, the Labour leader was also mistaken for Bert from Sesame Street.

Funny: Theresa May, the Home Secretary, is the most powerful woman in British politics, but only 55 per cent of voters know who she is, with some thinking it was comedian Sarah Millican

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was less well known than Mr Miliband, despite spending three years as Deputy Prime Minister.

Just 72 per cent of people named him correctly, with most muddling him up with Chancellor George Osborne.

Mr Clegg was also mistaken for businessman Peter Jones from BBC TV show Dragon’s Den.

The idea that politicians are all the same even seems to extend to their faces.

Hard man: Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) was mixed up with TV actor and presenter Ross Kemp (right)

Mr Osborne was confused with Mr Miliband as well as Forrest Gump star Tom Hanks.

Foreign Secretary William Hague, 
correctly named by 64 per cent, was confused with Cabinet colleague Work
and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith.

The bald former Tory leaders are in good company – Mr Hague was also wrongly identified as TV hard man Ross Kemp.

As
Home Secretary Theresa May is the most powerful woman in British 
politics, and in recent months has made little secret of her leadership 
ambitions.

But only 55 per cent of people questioned knew who she was, with most confusing her with Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman.

More worryingly, some thought she was stand-up comedian Sarah Millican.

Security: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, 
recognised by just 10 per cent of people, was mistaken for Wikileaks 
founder Julian Assange (right)

Confusion: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was recognised by three-quarters of people while the rest confused him with Chancellor George Osborne and Dragon's Den star Peter Jones (right)

Education Secretary Michael Gove is seen as one of the big stars of the coalition, pushing through major reforms of schools.

But only 29 per cent of people knew he was, mixing him up with UKIP leader Nigel Farage and John Gummer, a minister in John Major’s government.

Health Secretary Jeremy fared even worse, correctly named by only 18 per cent, with most thinking he was former althete and London Olympics chief Seb Coe.

Oddly some named him as Bob the Builder.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond suffered the indignity of being confused with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange by some of the 90 per cent of people who had no idea who he was.
