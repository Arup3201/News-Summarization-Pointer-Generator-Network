Wayne Rooney will undergo a scan on his injured knee on Wednesday while the rest of the Manchester United team-mates get ready for their Christmas party.

Rooney missed Tuesday night's 2-1 win against Stoke City after banging into an advertising hoarding at the end of their previous match with Hull, and manager Louis van Gaal is now waiting to see if his captain can make their next match at Southampton on Monday.

'We will have to wait until Wednesday to say anything about him (Rooney) because you never know with the knee,' said Van Gaal.

'My opinion is that it is not so heavy (bad) but I am not a doctor so we have to wait for the scan and then we know more.'

In addition, record signing Angel di Maria is due to miss the trip to the south coast with a hamstring injury. 

'Di Maria is not so heavy but of course he shall not play against Southampton but you never know,' added van Gaal, who has also confirmed Dutch international Daley Blind may be able to return by the end of the month after suffering a knee injury on international duty with Holland. 

'In December we will see light at the end of the tunnel,' smiled the United boss.

Rooney will still hope to attend United's Christmas bash which will be held in good cheer after the club's fourth win in a row.

Without Rooney, Di Maria, Luke Shaw, Phil Jones, Rafael, Blind and other injured players, United are digging deep to Van Gaal's delight. 'The fighting spirit is fantastic when you see the team, and that is why the fans are also excited,' he said.

'We have come back from bad results many times and against Stoke the referee should have whistled at 1-0 (when Assaidi challenged Fellaini) but he didn't and they scored. But we fought back again and fought til the end when we also had the long balls to Mr (Peter) Crouch, and we have survived.

'It is good for the players, the team and for me, and the party we have tomorrow!'

'I was not happy with the performance in the first half, we were not aggressive enough, and the last few moments were not necessary.'

Van Gaal was referring to a late Stoke surge which saw the previously underused David de Gea make saves from Mame Diouf and Marko Arnautovic before Diouf struck Ashley Young on the goal-line.

Stoke boss Mark Hughes thought United's winner, scored from Juan Mata's free-kick when it brushed over the head of Marcos Rojo, should have been ruled out.

'We were disappointed obviously with the award of the second goal, from our point of view we clearly thinks it's offside,' he said.

'The lad Rojo, it doesn't matter if he doesn't touch it, he is clearly interfering with play. He was ahead of the play in an offside position, so the referee and the assistant-referee should have cancelled that out. So that is disappointing for us, but we didn't allow that disappointment to effect us. We went again and the episodes at the end were unbelievable. It is the luck we have been having at the moment.

'And let's give de Gea credit, they were outstanding saves at the end.'
