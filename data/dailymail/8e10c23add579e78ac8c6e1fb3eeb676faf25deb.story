A pet owner was left distraught after a council sent away her cat for incineration without her knowing.

Louise Gill, 45, of Edgeley, Greater Manchester, spent four days with her husband Tony and son Billy looking for her six-year-old cat Charlie, after it went missing last month.

After asking around the neighbourhood, speaking to vets and putting up 'missing' posters, she was contacted by a neighbour who had seen a cat run over on the road and reported it to the council.

When Mrs Gill called Stockport Council, officials confirmed a dead cat had been picked up near her home. She then asked if she could collect her pet for burial at home.

But after various phone calls, she was eventually told Charlie had been taken to a tip in Bredbury - and when she rang there, she was told her pet had been cremated in line with their policy.

Mrs Gill said Charlie - whom she had owned since he was a kitten - was micro-chipped and should have been scanned after the body was picked up, so she could be contacted.

She added: ‘It is a disgrace to all pet owners who pay to have their pets micro-chipped for the council just to throw them away like a piece of rubbish at the tip.

‘It has been such a distressing experience throughout. I still can't believe that they just took him to the tip. It's bad enough to lose a pet without having to go through all this as well.’

A Stockport Council spokesman said: ‘We pass on our sympathy to Louise Gill for her loss.

‘The council has scanned dead animals found on the highway since 2010, and where possible contact the pet owner and notify them of their loss.

'When we pick up an animal, it is taken to a Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority facility, where it is stored before being incinerated.

‘Once at the facility, the animal cannot be retrieved. It is regrettable that Ms Gill feels that she has missed an opportunity to retrieve the cat. It was not the intention of any member of staff to add to Ms Gill's distress and we apologise for the delay in Ms Gill receiving a call back.’
