At first glance they appear to be simple 2-D doodles drawn in fine line.

But upon closer inspection, Jinil Park's creations reveal themselves to be fully functioning life-sized furniture.

The Korean designer's range, dubbed 'Drawing Furniture', is made from intersecting steel wires and has the appearance of a flat rough sketch.

Jinil used wires of different thicknesses to distort lines, creating variations in the lines drawn with a pen

The collection comprises four pieces including two chairs, two lamps and a table.

'The concept is making a 2D drawing into a 3D object,' Jinil, 25, tells MailOnline.

The key point of his work is 'the moments where the line is distorted,' says the Seoul-based artist.

'They express the designerâ€™s feeling, status, and emotion.'

Beginning by drawing various pieces of furniture with 
intersecting lines, the designer selected favourites to recreate in real
 life. Jinil then hammered wires of different thicknesses to imitate the lines drawn with a pen.

He intersected and welded the wire together until the structure was strong enough to use as one would a normal piece of furniture.

'I created the conjunction of these thin wires that eventually hold the 
human weight while a single wire cannot,' he tells dezeen.com.

Born in Incheon, South Korea, the artist went to college in Hongik University, Seoul, where he studied metal 
craft design.

The series is now being exhibited at a 
design fair in Cologne, Germany. He will decide the  price of the pieces when the fair finishes at the end of January.

'People can buy it if they are interested by contacting me directly,' says Jinil.

The series was previously on show at the Gwangju Design Biennale in South Korea from September to November 2013.
