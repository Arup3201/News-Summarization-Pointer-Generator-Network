North Korea has fired two ballistic missiles more than 300 miles into the sea in what has been called an 'armed protest' against military drills in the South.

A spokesman for the secretive state threatened 'merciless strikes' against South Korea and its ally the U.S., which helps conduct the military drills every year and insists they are just defensive.

The war between the two Koreas is still active because it ended in 1953 with an armistice, not a peace treaty, and left a heavily armed two-and-a-half mile wide zone along the border.

Making a statement: South Korean TV shows the two missile tests by the North today. The secretive state warned there would be 'merciless strikes' against routine military exercises carried out south of the border

Training: South Korean soldiers begin the annual military exercises near the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas - which despite its name is one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world

North Korea regularly conducts test firings of missiles, rockets and artillery, but they are often timed to express the country's dissatisfaction with actions by Washington and Seoul.

The missiles were fired early this morning at the start of military drills which are due to run until the end of April.

Fired from the west coast, they flew around 300 miles across the width of North Korea before landing in waters off the east coast, according to South Korea's Defense Ministry.

Spokesman Kim Min-seok called the launches an 'armed protest' against the South Korea-U.S. drills and a challenge to peace on the Korean Peninsula. 

UN resolutions prohibit any ballistic missile test by North Korea, and Mr Kim said Pyongyang appeared intent on triggering a 'security crisis'.

'We will respond sternly and strongly to any provocation,' he added. 

A statement carried by North Korea's state-run news agency said: 'The situation on the Korean peninsula is again inching close to the brink of a war.

Anger: Protesters gathered today near the U.S. Embassy in the South Korean capital Seoul

Uncompromising: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has taken an aggressive stance against the West 

'The only means to cope with the aggression and war by the U.S. imperialists and their followers is neither dialogue nor peace. They should be dealt with only by merciless strikes.'

Officials in the North Korean capital Pyongyang claim the drills are 'intolerable aggression' and preparation for an invasion - but South Korea says they are simply routine exercises.

The largest element of the two drills that began today is Foal Eagle, an eight-week exercise involving air, ground and naval field training, with around 200,000 Korean and 3,700 US troops.

The other is a week-long, largely computer-simulated joint drill called Key Resolve.

Around 28,500 American soldiers are deployed in South Korea as deterrence against potential aggression from the North.

North Korea has threatened attacks, including nuclear strikes, on the U.S. before, although it has never demonstrated its missiles could reach the U.S. mainland.

During the 2013 drills, tension rose amid North Korean rhetoric that included vows of nuclear strikes on Washington and Seoul. 

North Korea has carried out three nuclear tests - in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

In January, the North offered a moratorium on further tests if this year's joint drills were cancelled - a proposal rejected by Washington as an 'implicit threat' to carry out a fourth atomic detonation.

Peace talks: There were hopes of the third summit between the Koreas since 1953, but the prospect is dim 

Threats: Protesters outside the embassy. People floating anti-Pyongyang flyers by balloon could be targeted 

Jeung Young-Tae, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said Pyongyang was unlikely to conduct a fourth test just to protest against the exercises.

'Nuclear tests carry more significance than that,' he said. 'On the other hand, there is the chance of a mid- or long-range missile test.

'I would say that a demonstration that it could deliver a nuclear warhead would be more threatening to the world than an actual nuclear test'.

A new research report by U.S. experts published last week estimated that North Korea could be on track to have an arsenal of 100 nuclear weapons by 2020.

In a further sign of rising tensions, North Korean state-run website Uriminzokkiri warned today of a fierce response to any attempt by South Korean activists to float anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border by balloon.

'The response might not just be a few shots of gunfire but cannons or missiles,' the website said.

The two Koreas floated the possibility earlier this year of holding what would be the third summit between their leaders since the countries were divided 70 years ago.

It is not certain whether the meeting will take place because the two countries disagree on terms.
