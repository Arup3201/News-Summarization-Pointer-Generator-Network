Fresh from winning the Barclays Premier League title Manchester City took their celebration party to the beach on Wednesday.

Manuel Pellegrini's side secured their second title in three years with a comfortable 2-0 win over West Ham on the final day of the season to finish two points clear of Liverpool.

Captain Vincent Kompany and his City team-mates turned Manchester blue on Monday during their open-top bus parade, and just 48 hours later were pictured hitting the beach in Abu Dhabi.

On the volley: The champions, who celebrated their title in Manchester on Monday, will face Al Ain tomorrow

The City squad, led by Jesus Navas, Fernandinho, Alvaro Negredo and Aleksandar Kolarov, enjoyed a kickaround on Wednesday.

The City team touched down in Abu Dhabi yesterdayÂ  and will hoist an open training session before playing Al Ain - the team of former Sunderland and Ghana star Asamoah Gyan - a day later.

City will be playing the Arabian Gulf champions at their newly opened Hazza Bin Zayed stadium, a game they were due to play in January of this year, only to be held by Blackburn in the 3rd round of the FA Cup and have a replay scheduled at the same time as they were due to make the trip.

It seems as though the tour will be a fitting end to an excellent season for City, after adding the Premier League to the Capital One Cup they won after beating Sunderland at Wembley in March.

And it is expected that England stars Joe Hart and James Milner - after being called into Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad on Monday afternoon - will not play a part in Thursday's exhibition match.

The Three Lions manager will be hoping both players will be fit ahead of their meeting up with the rest of the squad next Monday.
