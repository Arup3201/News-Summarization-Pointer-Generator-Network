New York has overtaken London to become the world's most popular city to live in for the super-rich.

London was previously the most desirable place to buy property because it was seen as well insulated from the dangers of the Eurozone, however that belief now appears to have changed with wealthy buyers concerned about the introduction of a UK mansion tax.

According to a survey by property agent Knight Frank, While High New Worth Individuals (HNWIs)  HNWIs are increasingly concerned about Britain's political future and have been spooked by the prospect of a tax on homes worth over £2million.

Tale of two cities: London, with it's famous landmark Big Ben (left) has been overtaken by New York, home of the Empire State Building (right), as the most popular city in the world to live in and own property

Prime location: Prices for sought-after areas in Central London, such as Kensington's Egerton Crescent where the average home costs £8m, remain almost double that of comparable areas in New York

Britain's deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party Nick Clegg has been pushing for the introduction of the so-called mansion tax to the dismay of his coalition colleagues in the Conservative Party.

Stephan Miles-Brown, head of 
residential development at Knight Frank told the Financial Times: 'At 
the moment what's spooking people is any thought of mansion tax.

'People are are worrying that the Conservatives will have to give way on this as part of a coalition deal.

The cities that matter most to High New Worth Individuals

'The super-rich can deal with facts and figures quite easily. What they hate is uncertainty. They sit on their hands.'

Meanwhile New York is seen as safe bet 
owing to it's position as the gateway to the U.S. economy and popularity
with South American investors.

Property prices in the Big Apple are also considerably lower than those in London which ranks third when it comes to expensive real estate with prices as high as £2,540 per sq ft in prime central areas.

New York ranks eighth with prices of £1,300 per sq ft. 

New York’s market performance over the past year has been aided by the growing availability of high-quality new-build properties with prime sales volumes hit their highest level for 25 years.

The survey found that Russians, who have long an important driver of the London market, became a growing force in both New York and Miami in 2012 , alongside the ever-rising demand from Latin America.

According to the survey London has maintained its position as the most important city in the world in terms of 'knowledge and influence' the second in terms of 'economic power' and the fifth in terms of political power.

New York however reigns supreme when it comes to economic clout with a GDP of $1,243bn, more than double London's $536bn.

One of the most notable features of the survey was the emergence of cities in the Asia-Pacific region as global powerhouses.

as the gateway to the U.S. economy and increasing popularity with South 
American and Russian investors

While Paris was in third place, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney took up fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh respectively.

Shanghai was rated as the sixth most important city to HNWIs, while the Indonesian cities of Jakarta and Bali saw the highest increase in property prices.

The Middle East’s first entry, Dubai, is at number 29, while South America’s leading cities, Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo, only just scrape into the top 40.
