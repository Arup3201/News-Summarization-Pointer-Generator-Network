The sun may not have made it out in time for the annual Buckingham Palace garden party, but that didn't stop the Duchess of Cambridge debuting a beautiful summery look.

Wearing a round-neck Emilia Wickstead coat in canary yellow silk, Kate brought a ray of sunshine to the proceedings today.

She accessorised the coat, which neatly skimmed her by now very evident bump, with a cream Jane Corbett hat with rippled bow and large pearl drop earrings (and, it goes without saying, her trusty nude pumps).

The party, when the Queen hosts a tea for 8,000 esteemed members of the public in the gardens of her London residence, is considered to be one of the highlights of the royal summer calendar.

Sunny delight! Kate brightens up the Buckingham Palace Garden Party in a canary yellow coat

Royal bump watch: The duchess's tall, athletic physique has meant she has remained slender throughout - only now is her bump really beginning to show

In-laws: Kate spent much of the afternoon in the company of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall

Kate spent much of the afternoon in the company of Prince Charles and Camilla, both of whom seemed to be predicting rain - they each clutched their trusty Fulton umbrella - but thankfully hadn't had to put them into use.

Camilla wore a beautiful brocade coat by Fiona Clare topped off with a flamboyantly feathered hat, while Prince Charles looked elegant in dove grey tails. 

The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent were also in attendance.

This was the second year that Kate had attended the Queen's garden party, which the monarch uses as a way of thanking people who have contributed to public life or their local community.

Kate attended the party for the first time last year, something which at the time was said to be a real rite of passage for the fledgling royal.

This was also the second year that Kate attended alone. Last year William was tied up with duties on Anglesey, where he serves as a helicopter rescue pilot, and this time round too prior engagements kept him away.

Spectacular: Buckingham Palace provides a beautiful backdrop for the uplifting event

Making her way through the 
8,000-strong crowd on the lawn to the rear of the palace, Kate, 31, 
chatted with well-wishers including Marie Curie nurse Susan Bradley who 
said afterwards; 'She instantly recognised my uniform and the daffodil 
in my lapel and told me that she had great admiration for the work the 
charity does as our staff cared for her own grandfather in his home when
 he was terminally ill.'

Another guest called out to Kate 'you
 look lovely in yellow' to which she smiled and thanked him, gently 
smoothing her hand over her swelling belly.

She also chatted with guest Juliet Rogers about the affect the weather was having on her pregnancy,

'She said that the one benefit of the
 weather was that it was keeping her temperature down. She said she was 
thankfully rather cool.'

Bright: The Duchess of Cambridge added a flash of summer colour to the event, which was, as seems to be customary of late, blighted by grey clouds and overcast skies

It was only the second garden party 
the Duchess had attended but is clearly learning fast, as she chatted 
easily with several dozen guests as she slowly made her way to the green
 and white stripped royal tea tent where the other members of the family
 were slowly gathering.

Among the guests was British Olympic 
swimmer Rebecca Adlington, looking summery in a floral dress by, 
appropriately, The Pretty Dress Company and Topshop shoes.

She said: 'Everyone told me to wear 
my Olympic uniform but how often do we get the chance to dress up for 
something like this? I have been here a lot over the last year - we have
 been milking the Olympics a lot, I know - but it is always a real 
honour.'

Julie Roberts, one of the founding 
members of the Military Wives Choir was among those who chatted to the 
Queen, resplendent in a sugar pink Karl Ludwig coat and dress and Angela
 Kelly hat.

Mrs Roberts was accompanied by her husband, Captain Tommy Roberts of the
 Royal Marines, and sons Captain Thomas Roberts, also a marine, and 
student son Ciaran.

She said: 'We have sang for the Queen a number of times and it was a delight to meet her in person.'

Good time: The royals are joined by up to 8,000 guests at each royal garden party, and each consumes around 14 cucumber sandwiches 

Blossoming:
 With just under two months to go until her estimated due date, Kate 
looked pretty in a cocoon-cut Emilia Wickstead coat that accentuated her growing bump

Eyes front! A royal guard can't resist flicking his gaze right to catch a glimpse of Kate as she chats to Charles and Camilla

Bond: Kate shares a joke with Camilla, with whom she is said to have a close relationship

Party time! Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge enjoying the atmosphere at the summer season's first royal garden party

Against the flow: Kate is confronted by dozens of guests keen to get closer to her at the Buckingham Palace event 

Esteemed: Guests at the Queen's garden parties include members of the public who have contributed in some way to public life

Chic: Kate's Jane Corbett hat - one she wore in June last year with a cream Alexander McQueen dress-coat for the Order of the Garter ceremony - with the silk yellow coat

Cameras at the ready! The partygoers held phones aloft to catch some of Kate's magic on film

Ladies in waiting: Kate spent time chatting to a cornucopia of colourfully dressed band of guest

Popular: Kate was surrounded by curious crowds keen to catch her every word

Warm welcome: The Queen and fellow royals mingle with the crowd, which today included Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington

Hostess with the most: At 87, the Queen at 87 still knows how to throw a great party - one of three garden events she will host this summer

The Queen, wearing a Karl Ludwig coat and Angela Kelly hat, met a member of the Military Wives Choir along with her military husband and two sons. On her lapel the Queen wore the star-shaped Jardine Star brooch, an eight-point diamond piece that was left to her by Lady Jardine in 1981. The Queen has since worn the piece many times

Kate chose a bespoke version of the Marella coat by high society design darling Emilia Wickstead.

Kate has worn a number of garments by the much-admired designer, including a dusky pink dress worn at a garden party this time last year.

This yellow silk coat is said on the website where an off-the-peg version can be found to be 'elegant and classic with a hint of playfulness' and is inspired by 1950s 'society swan' Marella Agneli.

Regal style: An off-the-peg version of Kate's Emilia Wickstead coat is on sale at Matchesfashion.com now for £1,285 (but given the impact of the Kate Effect it won't be around for long...)

WE'VE SEEN THAT HAT SOMEWHERE BEFORE! 

Kate's hat was a cream sinemay hat with rippled bow trim by milliner Jane Corbett. Corbett has long been a trusted milliner to the Middletons and made the tilt-brim hat that Carole Middleton wore to the Royal Wedding in 2011.

Corbett, who  has a studio in Hungerford, Berkshire, was trained under Rose Cory, milliner to the Queen Mother.

Corbett also created headgear for Carole for Royal Ascot, the Derby, Trooping the Colour, for Pippa for various society weddings and for Kate, who wore a royal blue Jane Corbett at the Duke of Edinburgh's 90th birthday celebrations - and of course, Kate wore today's cream creation for the Order of the Garter.

The Queen’s garden parties are quintessentially British and a chance to celebrate the achievements of people who have contributed to public life or their local community.They have been held at Buckingham Palace since the 1860s when Queen Victoria instituted what were known as public 'breakfasts', although they took place in the afternoon.In the 1950s the number of garden parties held at Buckingham Palace was increased from two to three a year, taking the place of presentation parties attended by debutantes.They have since evolved into a way of rewarding public service and are attended by people from all walks of life, invited on the recommendation of a variety of national organisations including the Government, Civil Service, Armed Forces and the Diplomatic Corps as well as charities and local Lord Lieutenants.The parties normally take place in June and July but have been brought forward this year due to the Jubilee celebrations.

Esteemed guests: Attendees of the party are thanked by the Queen for their contribution to society

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied by other members of the Royal Family, enter the palace gardens at 4pm to the sounds of the National Anthem played by as military band.Each member of the Royal family then circulates among the guests through 'lanes' which are peculiar to Royal garden parties. Random presentations are made so that everyone has an equal chance of speaking to Her Majesty and members of her family before they arrive at the Royal tea tent to meet VIP guests.Tea and other refreshments are served in enormous quantities. At a typical garden party, around 27,000 cups of tea, 20,000 sandwiches and 20,000 slices of cake are consumed with 400 waiting staff involved in the serving.Last year guests were treated to tea, iced coffee and organic apple juice along with cucumber and egg mayonnaise sandwiches, mini strawberry scones, coffee éclairs and tiny chocolate mousse cakes embossed with a gold crown.In recent years, the Queen has been forced to try and make savings elsewhere in her budget to meet the bill for greedy guests who devour an average of 14 tea-time treats each.At 6pm the Queen and the Royal party leave the garden and are escorted into the palace by the Yeoman of the Guard, Gentlemen at Arms and Gentlemen Ushers.
