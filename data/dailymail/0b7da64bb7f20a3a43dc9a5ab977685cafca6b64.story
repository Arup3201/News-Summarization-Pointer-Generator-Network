This is the terrifying moment a fugitive robber forced a woman into the trunk of her own car at gunpoint, before driving off and withdrawing money from her bank account at several ATMs. 

The victim, who wished to be identified only as Christin, was captured on surveillance video pulling up to a drive-in ATM at a Wells Fargo bank in Arlington, Texas, in the early hours of January 14.

But as she inserted her card to begin a transaction, a man suddenly walked up from behind her black Kia and approached her window. He then crouched down and pointed a pistol at her face.

Fearing for her safety, Christin agreed to the robber's instruction for her to hand over the money from her bank account, police said. But after doing so, the man then led her to the back of the car.

Attack: The man, donning a woolly hat and carrying a cellphone in his left hand, walks up to Christin's window

Armed: He then crouches down and pulls out a pistol with his right hand, before pointing it at the victim's face

Recovering: Fearing for her safety, Christin (pictured speaking to Good Morning America after the attack) agreed to the robber's instruction for her to hand over the money from her bank account, police said

Once there, the suspect dressed in a woolly hat and carrying a cellphone in his other hand, ordered Christin to climb into the vehicle's trunk, before glancing around and slamming the lid shut, it is said. 

Footage shows the man then walking back to the front of the car and climbing into the driver's seat. As he gets in, he looks up at the surveillance camera and covers his hands with his sleeves.

Seconds later, he drives away. The man later traveled to a number of other ATMs, where he used his victim's card to withdraw more cash while she remained in the trunk, it is alleged.

He is also believed to have held up another man at gunpoint at a walk-up cash machine during this time, Arlington Police Department told WFAA. Eventually, the man parked the Kia and walked off.

After realizing her attacker had abandoned the car, Christin reportedly pulled on the trunk's emergency lever and jumped out, before running to a nearby convenience store.

There, she alerted the police at around 3.40am. Officers have now launched a manhunt for the suspect, who remains on the run, according to ABC News. The Kia was found that morning.

Speaking to Good Morning America, Christin described the moment the man had attacked her. 'He was like "give me the money", she said. 'After he pulled out his gun, he told me to get in the trunk.'

In reference to her escape, she added: 'I thought maybe I had a chance of getting out of here, so I found the unlock for the trunk from the inside. I popped it up.'

Wary: After shutting Christin in the trunk, the suspect walks to the front of the car and climbs into the driver's seat. As he gets in, he looks up at the surveillance camera (pictured) and covers his hands with his sleeves

Driving away: Seconds later, he drives away. The man later traveled to a number of other ATMs, where he used his victim's card to withdraw more cash while she remained in the trunk, according to police

On Thursday night, police said Christin was confronted while visiting the Wells Fargo drive-up ATM on the 2000 block of North Collins Street - and did not know her attacker.

In a statement, they said: '[Christin] reported that an unknown man approached her and ordered her to take money from her account.  She then alleged that the man forced her into the trunk of her vehicle and drove away from the location.

'The victim described being driven to additional banks, where the suspect is alleged to have taken more money from her bank account. At some point this morning, it is believed the suspect stopped the vehicle and walked away.

'The woman took that opportunity to escape from the trunk and ran to a nearby convenience store, where she called police. When she directed officers back to the location where she believed the vehicle had been, the car could not be found. Her vehicle was later located nearby.'

The suspect is described as being 'a black man in his early 20s who is approximately 5'6' tall with a short afro hairstyle wearing a grey hooded jacket or coat and jeans.'
