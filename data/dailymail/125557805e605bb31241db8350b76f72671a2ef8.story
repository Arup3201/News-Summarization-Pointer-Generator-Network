A Washington man may have come up with the most inventive criminal defense yet.

Jeffrey Barton, of Vancouver, WA, allegedly fired his gun into the air Monday to scare off thieves. When arrested and charged with illegal aiming or discharging of a firearm, he blamed Vice President Joe Biden.

Barton, 47, claims he woke up early in the morning to find robbers in his car and had no choice but to defend his property.

He told me to do it: Jeffrey Barton, 47, said he only did what Vice President Biden told him to do, 'fire my shotgun into the air'

‘I just woke up at about 3 o’clock in the morning and noticed that the dome lights were on in my car and there were three people inside,’ Barton told KOIN.

After freely admitting that he fired his weapon, Barton’s tale didn’t sway police.

Following his arraingment, Barton said that he was simply following the vice president’s advice.

‘I did what Joe Biden told me to do, I went outside and fired my shotgun in the air,’ he told the station.

Barton, of course, was referring to a YouTube town hall meeting in which Vice President Biden said that ‘if you want to protect yourself, get a double-barreled shotgun.’

‘I said ‘Jill, if there’s ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here … put that double-barreled shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house,’ Biden colorfully added.

Authorities have said that there is no evidence to suggest anyone was on Barton’s property, but neighbors told the station there was a loud party involving high school students the night Barton decided to blast away.

Barton only previous criminal charge involved drug paraphernalia, according to court records. Attempts by Mail Online to reach Spokane District Court for further details were unsuccessful.

No date has been set for Barton’s next court appearance.
