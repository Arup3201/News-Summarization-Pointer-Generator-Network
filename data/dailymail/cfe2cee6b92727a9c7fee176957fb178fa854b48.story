Dominique was just 13 years old when she was first trafficked for sex - one of an estimated 100,000 American children sold into prostitution each year, according to anti-trafficking charity, Saving Innocence.

And Dominique, now 18 and back in school, is by no means unusual. As Mark Harris, director of hard-hitting new film Abducted, reveals, teenage girls are easy prey for traffickers.

'Girls go out to LA thinking they're going to be pop stars and then they get drugged up and end up in trafficking,' he explains.

'Only two per cent [of young girls who go there] find work. Agents don't give a s*** about talent - they just care about money.

'You get all these 16 and 18-year-olds who think they're going to be the next Britney Spears... They think they're going to be stars but we all know they aren't.'

Delving deeper into Los Angeles' seedy underworld, Harris came across tales of paedophilia, rape, human trafficking and child abduction.

The latter proved something of a bombshell, so much so that it forms the premise of the controversial Abducted, a relentlessly black eye-opener of a film that offers a glimpse of Tinsel Town at odds with its glamorous image.

'It is very shocking,' he admits. 'I spent a whole night in Hollywood with Saving Innocence and in one night, I came across paeodophila, abduction, rape, trafficking and a story about two girls just being taken off the
 street.'

He adds: 'People did find the film very controversial because it's so dark and near to the edge but I wanted to go right near to the mark 
and show people what this is about.

'I didn't want to make a fairytale 
movie - I wanted people to really understand what Hollywood was really like.'

Incredible as it might seem, Harris and Saving Innocence insist every episode seen on screen is based on real life; a claim that becomes all the more believable when listening to Dominique and fellow survivor, Keila McCain.

Keila, who is now in her twenties, was rescued by workers from the charity after being plunged into a life of vice when she was just 12 years old.

'I was twelve when I became involved with sex trafficking,' she explains. 'When
 I was 18, it was the last time I got arrested for prostitution.

Tragic: According to Saving Innocence, up to 100,000 people are trafficked in the USA each year

'I 
was stuck in sex trafficking for six years, but that doesn’t define who I
 am today.'

Amazingly, Keila repeatedly slipped through the net and was the victim of numerous missed chances to intervene, although that, in part, was thanks to her pimp's insistence on moving her around the USA.

'I was 
exposed to sex trafficking when I was about 12, but I didn’t meet my
 pimp until I was about fifteen years old,' she remembers.

'We met one day on the 
streets, and he just started walking with me and trying to talk to me 
but I wouldn’t give him any eye contact, and then he was like -  "oh you
 must have a pimp cause you not talking to me" and I looked at him and 
he said "so what are you doing out here?" and we just went from there.

'Me and other girls worked all night, every night for him, with him 
moving us between states the whole year.'

She added: 'You’re risking so much; your life your freedom and your body and 
your degrading yourself in how others look at you.'

Keila is now off the streets and has found an apartment with the help of Saving Innocence but for other girls like her, the nightmare continues.

'I’m proud of myself because a year ago I couldn’t see this happening – 
all I saw was the streets,' adds Keila.

'But my past doesn’t take away my present. I’m
 going fast and strong and independent and now I finally feel worthy of love.'

Abducted is released on 17th March. For more on Saving Innocence and their work, see savinginnocence.org
