Five-time world player of the year Marta has sustained minor injuries in a car crash in Brazil.

The star of Brazil's women's football team was taken to a hospital for tests but had only a few bruises and was released after Saturday's crash in northeastern Brazil, where she was on holiday.

Authorities said Marta lost control of the Audi she was driving and crashed hard on the side of the road.
