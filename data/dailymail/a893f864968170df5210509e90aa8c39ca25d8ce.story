A £150,000 Lamborghini has been destroyed after it caught fire at the side of the road.

The white Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera started to smoke after the owner and his passenger jumped out when it lost power on the A41 dual carriageway near Watford.

Witnesses described the horror of watching the supercar, which does 0-60mph in 3.4 seconds and has a top speed of 202mph, burn to ‘a crisp’.

Firefighters called to the scene even took snaps of the car - which only had 18,000 miles on the clock - as two firemen hosed down the remaining chassis.

'It’s not the money - insurance should cover that - it’s that a beautifully crafted car is burned to a crisp near Watford. I mean, Watford of all places to decide to spontaneously combust.'

Andrew Dawson, of Hertfordshire Fire & Rescue, said it received a 999 call just before 9am on Saturday.

He added: 'We were called at 8.48am on Saturday to a location half a mile north of the M25 on the A41.

'A sports supercar was alight on the roadway. It was well alight when we arrived, firefighters put out the fire.'

Giles Cooper from Herts Constabulary said: 'We assisted in closing the road.

'Lane two reopened at 9.30am after the fire had been put out.

'We handed over to the Highway Agency at 11.40am for them to repair the road in lane one, where the vehicle caught fire.'

The rare supercar can accelerate to 62mph in just over four seconds.

The Gallardo was the first Lamborghini developed under Audi ownership.

In October 2012 an American teenager died after the Lamborghini Gallardo she was driving crashed and caught fire in Abu Dhabi.

Despite firefighters arriving on the scene within four minutes and extinguishing the fire, she could not be freed in time.

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced in September 2012 that all Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe and Spyder models built in 2004 - 06 would be recalled over a potential fire risk.
