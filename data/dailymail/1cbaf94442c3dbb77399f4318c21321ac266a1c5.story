From Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles escaping sewers in London's Southbank to a Royal Wedding in Sweden, a pair of British artists have shown a talent for creating 3D street art that sucks people in.

For eight years Joe Hill and Max Lowry travelled all over the world creating vibrant realistic scenes to brighten up pavements for pedestrians as they go about their business.  

The duo brought fantastical scenes of raging waterfalls, fiery depths and plunging canyons to city centre walkways - much to the delight of commuters across the globe.

Warner Bros pictures Japan and Joe and Max created this fairytale artwork to celebrate the release of Jack the Giant Slayer in cinemas today

Artwork was produced specially as part of Visit Britain's award-winning GREAT? campaign to encourage tourism in the run-up to the Diamond Jubilee and the London 2012 Olympics

The Joe and Max illustration of Prince William's marriage to Kate Middleton was displayed in Sweden and Singapore and even inspired a proposal of marriage on the 'love balcony'

This enormous painting broke two Guinness World Records for the longest and largest 3D street art in November 2011. It took ten days days to complete

Since Max tragically passed away in 
2010, Joe decided to continue their work, keeping the name 3D Joe and 
Max in Max's memory.

His
latest work includes a giant beanstalk bursting through the pavement to
celebrate the release of Jack The Giant Slayer, which opens in cinemas 
today.

He has also extended The Solaris Building in Singapore by four levels and created a futuristic city for Motorola in London and Barcelona in recent years. 

On the Southbank in London this street art showed the cartoon charactors the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles escaping from the sewer ahead of a new Nikelodeon series

While some of the artworks are fanciful others, like this one at The Solaris Building, Singapore, are intended to provide a realistic optical illusion

Just for fun: Disney Pixar characters including Buzz Lightyear featured in a 3D street artwork displayed in Covent Garden, London, to launch the new X-box game Kinect

Not
only do these incredible chalk drawings look realistic by themselves - 
but when passers-by jump into the scene they take on a life of their 
own. Their eye-catching creations are often created for live events, marketing campaigns, music videos and TV commercials.

Lucy Pratt, spokesperson for 3D 
Joe and Max,  said: 'We usually use chalk to 'map out' the 
picture and then use paint after, the illusion is created through a 
camera lens.  

'Sometimes
an intricately detailed large-scale drawing can take up to seven days 
to complete, sometimes longer depending on the weather.  

As well as the new film Jack The Giant Slayer, 3D Joe and Max made artwork measuring 26ft by 19ft for The Dark Knight Rises in Madrid

'Raise The Roof' was created for the Google party At The World Economic Forum in Davos and was painted on the ceiling rather than the ground

What A Drag' was painted for P&O 'Spirit of Britain' by Joe Hill, who posed in his paint-stained overalls once the project was finished

A 3D painting of Covent Garden was displayed in Shanghai, Singapore as part of the 'Visit Britain' Campaign in 2011

'Our standard size is 6 meters x 3 meters and these take, on average three to four days.'

 In
November 2011, 3D Joe and Max broke the Guinness World Record for the 
World’s Largest and the World’s Longest Anamorphic Artwork at West India
Quay, London for Reebok Europe.

In 2012, 3D Joe and Max won an award in the Global Marketing category at
the Marketing Society Awards for Excellence for Visit Britain’s GREAT 
campaign, a world tour of 10 cities promoting tourism to the UK in the
lead-up to the Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics in 2012.

Living on the edge: Car Crash depicted a realistic scene of a car hanging over a crevasse was painted for Auto Glass in London's Trafalger Square

This 3D Street artwork of a bridge across a deep canyon was created for the charity Brandon Trust which helps people with learning disabilities

This is picture is the last one Joe and Max painted together when they travelled to Paris for Google's annual party in 2010 before Max's tragic death
