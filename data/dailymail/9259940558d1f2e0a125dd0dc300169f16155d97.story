Many people turn to sport when times get tough and pretty Amy Brown is no exception. 

When the 21-year-old suffered cruel taunts at school for gaining good grades and wearing boy's clothes, she took her frustrations out on the rugby field. 

From the age of 12, Amy, who lives in the Forest of Dean, played at least twice a week for her local club.

Scrummy: Rugby-loving Amy Brown, 21, from the Forest of Dean is a finalist in the Miss England competition

Beauty and brains: Amy turned to the rugby pitch after her schoolmates teased her for being clever...she says that 'she's now having the last laugh' 

Nearly ten years on, Amy has blossomed into a young beauty, so much so that her friends suggested she enter a local beauty pageant. 

Last month she was crowned Miss Forest of Dean, just in time for the Six Nations.

Amy, who stands 5ft 8ins tall, will swap her muddy boots for high heels when she competes in the semi-finals of Miss England in June.

Amy, who is studying Criminology at the University of Gloucester, said: 'I never expected to come this far. I've never been into high heels and dresses.

'For me, it was always rugby and drinking with the lads in the bar afterwards. The closest I ever had to having a picture taken was doing a selfie.

'I never ever thought of myself as being particularly glam. Before I got into rugby I was bullied at school.

The 'boffin' has grown up: Amy now has a boyfriend, 22-year-old gym instructor Ben Jones

 

More comfortable in boots: Amy says that she had to practice 'loads' to walk properly wearing heels

'I wasn't very popular and worked hard so the bullies called me 'boffin' and 'ugly'. Even in my teens I didn't wear makeup and played rugby to deal with the name calling.

'It was a way I could get my frustration out but I really enjoy it. I'm in the second row so I'm in the thick of the action.

'I always get stuck in and I've got knocked out twice. I haven't got any cauliflower ears thankfully.'

Amy, who has a long term boyfriend, gym instructor Ben Jones, 22, has beaten thousands of hopefuls to reach the semi-finals of Miss England.

She added: 'I never thought I'd make it to the semi-finals of Miss England. It's been an amazing journey.

'Before the competition I'd never been on a cat walk. The first time I put on high heels I tottered about and almost lost my balance so I've had to practice loads.

'It's a great feeling to get glammed up now, especially when I think back to the abuse I got from the bullies. I do feel like I've had the last laugh.'
