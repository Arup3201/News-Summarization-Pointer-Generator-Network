A British student who was hoping to become the fastest and youngest woman to row 2,400 miles across the Pacific has quit - after only managing to stay on course for 60 miles.

Elsa Hammond, 29, planned on single-handedly rowing from California to Hawaii as part of the Great Pacific Race - aiming to complete her challenge within 99 days to break the world record.

But bad weather and strong currents blew her well off course early on and after a total of 37 days she is just 60 miles closer to the finish line, having drifted 500 miles off her planned route.

Wrong direction: Elsa Hammond was aiming to complete her challenge within 99 days to break the world record. But at her current rate of progress it would take her three years to reach Hawaii

The Bristol University English Literature PhD student was hoping to complete the challenge in her custom-built 22 foot ling six foot wide rowing boat withing 99 days.

But at her current rate it would take her more than three-and-a-half years to reach Hawaii, so she has decided to pull out and head row with the current towards Mexico.

Speaking on her blog, Ms Hammond said: 'Given the tricky conditions I have been facing since the beginning I'm much further south and further behind schedule than planned.'

Funding: Ms Hammond, pictured in her boat, raised a staggering £100,000 to compete in the event and has formal sponsorship from Bristol University

Difficulties: Writing on her blog Ms Hammond said that 'tricky' conditions meant she was much further south than she had planned

Going it alone: A total eight boats are competing in the Great Pacific Race but Ms Hammond was the only solo competitor

'I am being advised that, even if I do manage to punch my way westward against the wind and waves from this position, the likelihood of meeting volatile weather (tropical cyclones, hurricanes) is greatly increased by the more southerly latitude that I'll be rowing at and the increasing lateness of the year,' she added.

'I've thought long and hard about this, and have decided, with advice, that the most sensible decision is to alter course for a different destination,' she went on to say.

Off course: Bad weather and strong currents have blown Elsa Hammond 500 miles off her planned route from Monterey in California to Hawaii. After a total of 37 days she is still only 60 miles closer to the finish line

Troubled waters: The oarswoman was unable to make significant progress against the strong headwinds and has drifted directly south instead of west

Heartbreak: Ms Hammond, from Bristol, said she was disappointed that she had now altered her course and pulled out the race but felt it was the right thing to do

Ms Hammond raised a staggering £100,000 to compete in the event and has formal sponsorship from Bristol University and a number of small businesses in the area.

A total eight boats are competing in the Great Pacific Race but Ms Hammond is the only solo competitor. The others are made up of between two or four sailors.

Ms Hammond set off from Monterey in California on June 8 with the aim of become the fastest and youngest woman in history to single-handedly complete the route.

But she has been unable to make significant progress against the strong headwinds and has drifted directly south instead of west.

Ms Hammond has traveled a total 560 miles and actually has the highest 'miles per rower' of anyone in the race. But because she is heading in the wrong direction, she is just 60 miles closer to Hawaii and is therefore in last place but quite a considerable distance.

Meanwhile, the other competitors have powered ahead and are now just 1,282 miles from finishing.

Ms Hammond, from Bristol, said she was disappointed that she had now altered her course and pulled out the race but felt it was the right thing to do.

'I am disappointed not to be completing what I set out to do, but I am confident that this is the right decision, and one that does not put an end to the journey,' she said.

'There are many risks involved in ocean rowing, and I started in the full knowledge of these, but the balance is now tipping to those risks becoming too great,' she added.

I would rather alter course to a new route and make land under my own power now, than run the increasing risk of needing to be airlifted out later and putting my and others' lives in danger.

Ms Hammond was raising money for The Plastic Oceans Foundation environmental charity and gender equality charity, the GREAT Initiative.

She has previously unicycled across England to raise money for a four-month conservation expedition to Borneo and attempted to climb the challenging Black Cuillin ridge on the Isle of Skye.Great Pacific Race director Chris Martin said: 'We are sad to hear that after more than a month of battling against adverse weather conditions, Elsa has decided to postpone her row to Hawaii.'

'We commend her in making a very difficult decision and having the dedication to complete her current journey by touching land under her own power,' he added.
