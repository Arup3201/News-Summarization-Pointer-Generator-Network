This is the Iranian conman who allegedly duped ten woman into living with him after pretending to be an oil tycoon with contacts in the fashion industry.

The man, who has been named by Spanish media as Shoja S, reportedly fathered seven children with the women after convincing them to live at his Spanish villa.

He promised to make the women, reportedly aged between 19 and 24, into catwalk stars, but they were then unable to leave after allegedly being subject to emotional and physical abuse.

The 50-year-old, who has been named by Spanish media as Shoja S, reportedly fathered seven children with the women after convincing them to live at his Spanish villa

'They were always controlled and supervised by him,' it was reported by Spanish newspaper ABC, according to The Local.

'He threatened to harm them if they didn't tell him everything they were doing.'

One of the women has now filed a lawsuit against Shoja S, who is reportedly about 50-years-old, for allegedly forcing her family to pay the €6,500 (£5,300) rent for his mansion in Marbella where they were housed.

Eight others have pressed charges against him for physical and psychological abuse that allegedly left them in a state of 'terror'.

Shoja S, who pretended to be a CEO for an oil company, told a court in Marbella that the girls were his employees.

The woman - originally from Germany, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Denmark, Mongolia, Russia and Turkmenistan - have left the house.

Some are living in shelters, while one has left the country.
