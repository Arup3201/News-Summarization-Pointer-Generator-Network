More than 50,000 carers will have to quit their jobs to look after loved ones with dementia this year, research shows.

Dementia care costs businesses in England £1.6billion a year and 66,000 employees have to adjust their work schedule to make time for their caring responsibilities.

Public Health England and leading health charity, the Alzheimer’s Society, have joined forces in a major campaign to encourage the public to tackle one of the nation’s biggest health issues.

The Dementia Friends initiative, which has also been backed by some of Britain’s biggest stars, aims to show that it will take a whole society response to enable people with the condition to live well.

Celebrities including Amanda Holden, Ray Winstone, Chris Martin, Paul O’Grady, Simon Pegg and Alesha Dixon feature in a video, urging the public to become ‘dementia friends’, as they perform the Beatles classic, With A Little Help From My Friends.

Author Sir Terry Pratchett, who has Alzheimer’s, is also involved. And yesterday Sir Paul McCartney was announced as an ambassador for the campaign.

Dementia Friends has released research which shows signs of businesses being more willing to help with dementia care.

A report compiled by the Centre for Economics and Business Research for the campaign showed that most firms have already provided or would consider providing support to carers of someone living with dementia.

Nearly nine out of ten businesses polled (87 per cent) have or would consider letting carers work flexible hours, while more than half of businesses would consider providing a range of support to dementia carers such as flexible working hours (63 per cent), extended leave (61 per cent), working from different locations (53 per cent) plus counselling and support (51 per cent). Around 18 per cent would consider paying for respite care.

The report also shows the average person diagnosed with dementia has been in their current job for at least nine years.

The relatively rapid progression of the disease means that it is inevitable that many people affected while still working will have to take early retirement.

Researchers found that carers are struggling to fit care duties into their lives as they spend 28 hours a week on average caring for loved ones.

The majority (51 per cent) are also working; employed carers spend an average of 18 hours a week caring on top of their jobs.

More than one in four firms (27 per cent) have had an employee who needed to make adjustments to work schedules to care for a dementia sufferer.

Despite the survey showing employers’ willingness to help, Jeremy Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, said more must be done.

‘The fact that thousands of workers in this country are juggling caring responsibilities without support and understanding from their employers is frightening,’  he said.

‘Society is not yet fully supportive of people with dementia, either in the workplace or in everyday life.

‘I would love to see everyone become Dementia Friends and make life that little bit easier for people with dementia.’

Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: ‘Our research shows that there is a real public desire to do more to help people with dementia live well in society.

‘This campaign will help people understand the issues faced and give them the information they need to support people in their community with dementia.’
