Freshwater crocodiles with an appetite for the toxic cane toads have worked out a clever way to get a delicious meal without being poisoned.

The  crocodile population in Northern Territory has dropped dramatically in the past few years but the ‘dwarf’ crocs have been munching away at the hind legs of the pests to survive.

Crocodile specialist Dr Adam Britton told Daily Mail Australia that they discovered a significant amount of toxic cane toads with missing legs after observing the areas around Bullo and Liverpool rivers in Arnhem Land, around 500 kilometres from Darwin.

‘My wife Erin did some surveys in 2009 after the cane toads reached the areas. She observed the twisted and mangled toads and noticed the crocodile teeth marks,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘We know that they often like to flick and tear off whatever they’re holding in their mouth and that’s what we’re seeing a lot around the area.

‘We were sceptical at first but now we’ve seen patterns and it’s obvious that they’re mangling the back legs to feed themselves.’

While the inevitable arrival of poisonous cane toads could have affected the small population of freshwater crocs, Mr Britton said the toads may have found a safe way to consume the toxic pests.

‘The toads have toxins in parts of their body that will usually kill the crocodiles when they consume them,’ Mr Britton said.

'We're afraid that the toads could wipe them out - it's a serious effect on the crocs' population and there weren't many of them to start with.

'The ones who have been tearing of their legs from its limbs are the ones who have survived.

‘Or the previous ones who have consumed toads before were put off after eating a whole toad.

‘So they simply learn during the trial and error and found that this is the way to eat delicious toads in a natural progression and they know its safe.’

Dwarf crocs can grow to one-and-a-half metre in size but Dr Britton added that they are still categorised in the same species as freshwater crocodiles.

‘We call them dwarfs or pygmies because they’re half the size smaller than a normal freshwater croc,’ he told Daily Mail Australia.

‘The reason why they’re so small is because there is less food for them to eat but they’re incredible survivors – If they don’t get enough food or they eat really slow – they just won’t grow as much.'
