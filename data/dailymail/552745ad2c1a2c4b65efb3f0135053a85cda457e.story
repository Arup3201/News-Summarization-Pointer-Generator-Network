Jaield: Sabrina Zunich, 19, who pleaded guilty last month to aggravated murder in the stabbing death of 41-year-old Lisa Knoefel, was sentenced Monday,  to life in prison with a chance for parole in 30 years.

An Ohio teenager who killed her foster mother in 2012 after her foster father's told her to do it, has been sentenced to life in prison with a chance for parole in 30 years.

Nineteen-year-old Sabrina Zunich pleaded guilty last month to aggravated murder in the stabbing death of 41-year-old Lisa Knoefel  in their home in the Cleveland suburbs.

Zunich testified at the trial of Kevin Knoefel that he'd threatened suicide if his wife wasn't killed. Zunich and the now 44-year-old Kevin Knoefel were romantically involved.

Kevin Knoefel received the same sentence as Zunich after a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder and sexual battery. 

He was accused of having a sexual relationship with his foster daughter and showing her how to stab his wife.

Prosecutors say Knoefel wanted his wife dead to collect $750,000 in life insurance.

At Monday's sentencing, Judge RIchard Collins made his thoughts clear. 

 'I don't think there was any question she was manipulated and used by the co-defendant,' Collins said. But he said the seriousness of the crime outweighed all factors. 

'Aggravated murder is aggravated murder,' Collins said. 'But this was not a single violent act.'

He said Lisa Knoefel suffered before she died.

'She was screaming for help and begging the defendant to stop. She did not die immediately. I cannot imagine the nature of terror and fear.'

Prosecutors told jurors that Kevin Knoefel wanted his wife out of the picture but was afraid he'd lose custody of their three-year-old daughter if they divorced. 

During the trial, Zunich said she had fallen in love with her foster father and feared he would commit suicide if she didn't carry out their plot to kill his wife. 

She said it was he who devised the plan to murder his wife.

She said they were carrying on a sexual relationship and discussed several plans to kill Lisa Knoefel, including shooting her and making it look like a burglary, or finding a hit man. 

Zunich testified that she put on a ski mask and fatally stabbed 41-year-old Lisa Knoefel in her bed as she fought back in November 2012, when she was 17.

Prosecutors said Zunich stabbed and cut her more than 150 times with a 10-inch serrated knife.

She was not deterred even though Knoefel fought and pleaded for her to stop and the woman's teenage daughter tried to pull Zunich off her mother and called 911.

Prosecutors have said they were unaware of Zunich's sexual relationship with Kevin Knoefel or that he had persuaded her to kill Lisa Knoefel until Zunich spoke with them in May, 2013.

The case against Kevin Knoefel for the most part rested on the testimony of Zunich, whose graphically detailed her relationship with Knoefel and what led her to kill Lisa Knoefel.

She testified in court that Knoefel told her he didn't love his wife anymore and didn't want a divorce because he didn't want to share custody of Hailey, their 3-year-old daughter.

He told her they could raise Hailey together.

On November 15, 2012, he cried and told her he had a big fight with his wife and was going to kill himself if she was not dead. With his encouragement, she decided to kill Lisa Knoefel.

Zunich said Monday at sentencing that she was remorseful. 

'I want to say how sorry I am for all those I hurt,' she said. 'Lisa did not deserve what happened to her. I ask forgiveness be given to me - not for my benefit but for those who need the healing process to begin. I can't explain how much remorse I have and how much sadness I deal with.'
