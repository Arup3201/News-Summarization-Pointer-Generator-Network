Everton have joined Aston Villa and Celtic in asking for Chelsea's Christian Atsu on loan.

If
 successful it would mean they would have to make any deal for Romelu 
Lukaku a permanent one as they can't have two players on loan from the 
same Premier League club.

22-year-old Atsu is wanted by a raft of clubs in England, Spain and Germany for a year-long loan deal after spending last season at Vitesse Arnhem in Holland.

Experience: Atsu spent last season on loan at Dutch side Vitesse and Celtic hope they can be his next club

West Ham United and Aston Villa are known to be interested in the left winger, with Hamburg and Espanyol also linked.

Atsu enjoyed a successful loan spell in Holland, scoring five goals in 28 appearances - but has ruled out a return to the Erevidisie this time round.

Chelsea are 
holding further talks with Didier Drogba over a one year player-coach 
contract. The 36-year-old is expected to make his return to Stamford 
Bridge later this week.

Misfit: The Belgian striker has failed to make an impression at his parent club since joining in 2011

Lethal: The striker netted 15 times in the league for the Toffees last year, and was their top scorer.

Youngster: Ronny Delia is hoping he can convince the player Celtic once tried to sign to come to Glasgow
