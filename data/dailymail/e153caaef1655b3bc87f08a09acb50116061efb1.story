Escaped jail: Eva Jaciskova, pictured in Ugg-style boots outside court today, stole £7,000 worth of shoes while working at Russell and Bromley

A shop assistant stole more than £7,000 of shoes by walking home in a new pair every day.

Russell and Bromley worker Eva Jaciskova slipped on a pair of designer shoes at the end of each shift at the Oxford Street store without anyone noticing.

Once home, Jaciskova would put the shoes up for sale on eBay, Southwark Crown Court heard.

The mother-of-two, who was yesterday spared a jail sentence, walked off with £7,363-worth of shoes before staff noticed a large amount of the shop’s stock was advertised on eBay.

Jaciskova, 37, who lives in High Wycombe, was then hauled into a meeting and initially denied stealing 26 pairs of shoes, before later admitting to her crime.

Sitting in the dock wearing a pair of tatty, black Ugg-style boots, she wept as details of her theft were read to the court.

Jaciskova had earlier pleaded guilty to one count of theft at a magistrate’s court in February.

Yesterday, prosecutor Peter Zinner said: ‘This is a breach of trust case. The defendant was an employee of Russell and Bromley in Oxford Street and she was employed by the store as a sales assistant.

‘It transpired in June last year that significant amounts of Russell and Bromley stock had found their way for sale on an eBay account. 

'In particular seven pairs of shoes and this is the initial tranche of shoes the defendant stole.’

Jaciskova, originally from Presov, Slovakia, stole shoes from the brand’s Diva, Laura and Skater ranges – with some pairs worth up to £400 each.

Mr Zinner said: ‘She admitted what she had done was take the shoes out of the boxes from the stock room over a period of weeks, worn them home and then placed them on eBay to sell. There was an element of pre-planning and deviousness because the defendant left empty boxes in the right place in the stock room.’

Jaciskova initially avoided prosecution by agreeing to hand in her resignation the day she was accused of the theft. 

‘However the staff were concerned that in fact that was just the tip of the iceberg because a significant number of shoes had gone missing from the stock room and a further 19 pairs of shoes were discovered having been stolen,’ Mr Zinner added.

‘Because the defendant had not volunteered the extent of her criminality and the second tranche significantly increased the loss to the company it was reported to the police and on November 24 last year the defendant attended High Wycombe police station.’ 

Robert Conway, representing Jaciskova, said his client was ‘truly ashamed and regretful’. He added that she suffered a ‘medical condition’ that she was now getting treatment for.

Judge Michael Grieve acknowledged she stole because she had been in financial difficulty, so instead of jail sentenced her to a 12-month community order with a three month curfew attached.

He said to Jaciskova: ‘I am told and I can see from your behaviour at the moment that the realisation of your behaviour and being found out – that combination has caused you shame and regret.’
