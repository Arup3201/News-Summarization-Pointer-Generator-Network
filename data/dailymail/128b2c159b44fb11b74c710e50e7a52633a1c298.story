Rory McIlroy shot a fine 66 in the first round of the Omega Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday – but still found himself upstaged by his playing partner, Andy Sullivan.

Competing for the first time in one of the star groups, the 28-year-old Englishman admitted he was nervous at the prospect of teeing it up alongside world No 1 McIlroy and US Open Champion Martin Kaymer.

It certainly didn’t show once he was one the course as he posted a wonderful 65 to set the early lead alongside Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts and Lee Westwood, who demonstrated just why he is looking forward to this season so much.

Sullivan had one eagle and five birdies in a bogey-free round but the best shot he played might have been a deft chip to six feet from a precarious spot at the sixth that allowed him to save par.

‘I was very impressed with his game,’ said McIlroy. ‘It’s the first time I’d seen Andy play and I like the fact he can move the ball both ways from the tee, while his putting stroke is just pure.’

Sullivan first hit the headlines last year with a hole in one that won him a trip into space. 

He certainly reached the heights when he started this campaign by claiming his first win on tour in the South African Open to fully earn his starting time among the elite.

Not that the modest Midlander saw it that way. 

‘I thought they’d messed up the draw when I saw that I’d been paired with Rory and Martin but it turned into one of the best days of my life,’ he said. 

‘They made me feel so comfortable and to play so well was just brilliant. To be honest, I didn’t look at a leaderboard all day. I was just enjoying watching Rory and Martin play. 

'Now I want to play alongside these guys more and more. It brings out the best in my game.’

Kaymer, in his first round since his Abu Dhabi meltdown, showed all his class with a 67 while McIlroy was a little irritated that a blemish-free performance was ruined by a bogey at his final hole, the ninth on the card.

‘It’s not the way you want to finish, obviously, but I’m happy enough with my score,’ he said. 

‘I started off slowly and didn’t hit a fairway until my eighth hole. But it got better as it went along.’

It certainly did. The fifth and sixth are two of the hardest holes on the course but McIlroy made them look easy with successive birdies.

Westwood told MailOnline in the build-up that he was relishing the prospect of this season more than any other in recent times and certainly made a good start with a flawless 65.

‘One of the joys of living in Florida is you don’t come out in your opening tournament trying to get rid of any rust,’ he said.

‘You get to play a lot of winter golf to keep sharp and that has shown today. I played really well.’

So did the Scot Stephen Gallacher, who is trying to become just the sixth player in European Tour history to win the same event three years in a row. 

He got his quest off on the right foot with a fine 66, including an eagle three on the par-five 13th. It means in 13 rounds on this course, Gallacher has now played the hole in 14 under par.

‘That’s just mad, isn’t it?’ said the Ryder Cup man. ‘To be honest, I wish I didn’t know that. It’s certainly put the pressure on tomorrow.'
