These incredible pictures, taken by pioneering documentary photographer Robert Frank, show a forgotten world of what London was like in the 1950s.  

From bankers in top hats and long coats juxtaposed with men delivering coal to children playing in the streets, the Swiss-born photographer's collection of black and white images give a unique glimpse of everyday life in the city for the rich and poor.

Taken between 1951 and 1953, the photographer - most famous for his photo book The Americans - focused on elements that expressed the character of the places he visited. He said of London: 'I liked the light, I liked the fog'.

Contrast: Robert Frank used his photography to document the stark differences between high and low strata of society. In this image, his composition juxtaposes a man delivering coal with bankers in long coats and bowler hats

Play: Children are seen playing in the street with one swinging from a tree in this candid shot of everyday life in the early 1950s

Light and shade: A sharply dressed man in a top hat is clearly seen in the foreground, but an abundance of fog cloaks buildings behind him

Wealth: Frank focused on elements that expressed the character of the places he visited. Here, a hearse is parked on the road while a street cleaner works in the background

Joy: In a perfectly timed click of the shutter, the photographer captured a dog mid-leap in the courtyard of what appears to be a factory

Commuter: London appears more familar as people board a city bus while a man in a smart black outfit holds a newspaper behind his back

Bright lights: This shot of the city captures the brightness of London after sunset, with a 'Look' sign for pedestrians in the foreground

Rain: A lone person walks along a deserted King Charles Street in central London on a drizzly day which doesn't look too different from the modern day

Character: A street cleaner and his cart is framed within the open window of a funeral hearse, while a child runs along the pavement

Rich and poor: A street performer plays the violin with a hat on the ground to collect coins, left, and right, wealthier men wear tailored coats and bowler hats as they walk along a busy city street

Beauty: Away from the bustling streets of the city, a man carrying a briefcase and hat walks through an empty park on a winter day

Londoner: Frank captures a candid shot of a musician as he walks up the steps of an Underground station carrying a double bass

Fashion: Top hats, sharp suits and tall umbrellas were clearly the height of fashion for London's men in the 1950s as these photographs show

Smile: A man is seen looking at the camera as he is surrounded by expensive cars and the fog has cloaked building in the background again

Guide: A doorman dressed in a top hat, long coat and gloves acts as a valet as he directs people in cars in London
