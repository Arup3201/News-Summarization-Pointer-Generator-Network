Lewis Dale, 17, is facing a lengthy jail term after stabbing his grandmother to death while high mephedrone

A teenager, jailed today for stabbing his grandmother to death while high on the former legal high mephedrone, was hallucinating that a Swat team was after him and he needed to 'go to war'.

Lewis Dale, 17, stabbed his grandfather Allan Dale, 80, twice with a kitchen knife before butchering stabbing his grandmother Irene Dale, four times as she lay in her bed screaming: 'What are you doing, Lewis?'

Dale wept in the dock of Hull Crown Court as he was told he would face receive a lengthy jail term after a jury found him guilty of charges of murder and attempted murder.

Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, told him: 'You have been found guilty of murder and attempted murder for which you will be sentenced after I have had a full report from a doctor.

'The sentence for murder is fixed by law, because you are 17, it will be that you are detained at Her Majesty’s pleasure.

'It is the equivalent of a life sentence, but I have the responsibility of passing a minimum term. You also have to sentenced for attempted murder.

'The sentencing exercise is not straight forward. I can tell you the sentence I will impose will be a long one.”

As Dale was led below to a cell, his father David shouted: 'Love you son!'

His grandfather Allan Dale appeared close to tears in the public gallery

Mother-of-three Irene Dale, who had been married 57 years, had taken in the grandson she had nursed from a toddler in a play pen because he needed a bail address as he was in trouble with police.

She had no idea he had bought £50 worth of methedrone that afternoon and was sat hallucinating that police Swat teams were coming for him and that he needed to pull on his helmet and 'go to war'.

He stormed into the pensioners' bedroom stabbing them as they lay in bed before stealing their television and jar of 50ps to exchange for six more grams of mephedrone within two hours of her death.

Allan Dale told Hull Crown Court: 'It 
was just like Norman Bates in Psycho. He had his bathrobe hood up and 
had picked the strongest knife in the block.

'He
 lunged at me and plunged the knife in my chest. I got up. I heard Irene
 say: "What are you doing Lewis?" She was scared. He went around to my 
wife and stabbed her as she tried to protect herself with the duvet

'He thew the knife at me and it ended up sticking in the floor.

Mr
 Dale tried to barricade himself in the bedroom shifting a cabinet 
across the door as he feared Lewis Dale thought they both weren’t dead 
and would return to kill them.

He
 tried to put his wife in the recovery position but could not dial 999 
as Lewis, who was expelled from school and stole from his father to pay 
for drugs, had cut the telephone cable.

Lewis
 Dale shouted from down stairs: 'Give me some money! Give me some money,
 then I’ll go!' before getting into a taxi with a case full of designer 
clothes and waving to his granddad 'as if he was going on holiday'.

He
 left the pair bleeding to death showing no remorse immediately trying 
to cover his tracks. He then took a taxi to his dealer’s address in Hull, where he sold their TV in exchange for more drugs.

Accused: Dale, left and right, denies murder and attempted murder. Jurors heard they will have to decide whether he was capable of intending to kill at the time of the attack

When armed police arrested him he only
 had two grams of mephedrone left and had dumped his mobile telephone 
and changed his clothes.

He
 never asked how his granddad was and was only worried about long he 
would serve in prison and where his valuable designer clothes where.

He told police the mephedrone he found 'was the best stuff in Hull' and asked:  'Am I in here for the longest?'

Dale
 was a heavy and habitual user of the drug, also known as Meow Meow and 
M-Cat, a former legal high which was only made illegal in the UK in 
2010.

He was expelled from 
South Holderness Technology College at the age of 15 for damage and 
threatening staff, soon after he began using the drug.

His
 grandfather told police: 'I can only describe Lewis as psychotic at the
 time, due to the way he lunged at me and went around the bed to stab 
Irene. I could not make sense of what was happening.'

Dale had been sent to live with his grandparents after assaulting a teenage boy outside his father’s home in Brough.

He
 had also been arrested two days before that incident after taking his 
father’s car without permission and running it off the road.

Scene: The house in Hull where Irene Dale was stabbed to death

Dale denied murder and manslaughter, claimed to have been suffering from a psychotic episode.

He
 sobbed in front of the jury saying he could not remember the attack and
 'does not deserved to be on this planet' for stabbing his grandparents 
while they lay in bed.

He 
said: 'My grandma was great, unbelievable. I loved her. We always used 
to go together and walk the dog. I always got on with my grandma and 
granddad.'

Dale claimed he 
had been using the drug for 18 months and admitted stealing cash, a 
mobile phone and credit cards from his father to pay for it.

He
 said immediately before the attack he remembers sitting on a sofa 
sharpening a knife thinking a Swat team was after him and he was scared.

He said he was having hallucination and he thought they were coming for him in his grandparent’s living room.

His
 defence team suggest he had armed himself because he thought he was 
'going to war' against the Swat team and pulled his hood up like putting
 on a helmet.

Dale’s
 barrister Andrew Robertson, QC, said: 'It is difficult to fathom how he
 could do it to the grandparents he loved so much. It becomes impossible
 to understand unless it is put in the context of this defedant being 
completely out of his mind. It will live with him for the rest of his 
days.'

Crown barrister 
Adrian Strong had told the jury: 'He is seeking to blame M-Cat for his 
actions. It could be the shame and grief at what he has done means he is
 not being honest with you.

'His
 actions were clearly influenced by his drug taking but were decisions 
nonetheless, that he made and there are consequences.'

Prof
 Robert Pethic, a consultant psychiatrist, told the jury he did not 
believe Lewis Dale was suffering from a drug-induced psychosis.

He said: 'The very reason M-Cat
 is illegal, and not a proper drug, is because it has a whole range of 
unpleasant affects, making your heart race, altering your perceptions 
and making you feel charged.

'Unfortunately
 for quite a lot of young people, it is a feeling they desire. It can be
 dangerous, which is what we have seen here. It’s right M-Cat is not 
lawful.'

Dale was found 
guilty on on 10-2 majorities after a seven-day trial at Hull Crown 
Court. The jury spent 7 hours 12 minutes deliberating.  will be 
sentenced at Hull Crown Court in four weeks time.
