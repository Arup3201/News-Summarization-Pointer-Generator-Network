A formerly obese man is getting his teeth into a new challenge by running the London Marathon after shedding more than a quarter of his body weight.

Paul Hinton, 38, from Stoke-on-Trent, once tipped the scales at a belt-busting 20st, but decided to get fit after joining a slimming club in April last year.

The father of three has now lost 6st and has raised an impressive £2,000 for Caudwell Children's charity in the process.

He now plans to join Mo Farah and tackle the London Marathon on April 13 and in a quirky twist, 30 of his friends will be running a mile each to support him - while pushing an object weighing six stone to symbolise his weight loss.

Paul, a delivery driver, now weighs a trim 14st 7lbs and said: 'I felt really emotional when I heard that they were doing this for me.

'When I joined the group last year, I had absolutely no confidence because of my weight. I had tried programmes like Weight Watchers but nothing seemed to work.

'Then I decided to join Life Without Limits. The group was so friendly and when we did a weigh-in earlier this year, I found I had lost 5st 7lb.'

He adds: 'But the main thing wasn't about weight for me. It was accepting myself. I found that the world of being fat is a lonely place where you feel like people are judging you all the time and have a perception that you are lazy.'

Goal: Paul has already raised £2,000 worth of sponsorship money for the race, which takes place on 13th April

So low did Paul feel about his weight, he found himself reluctant to leave the house and even left him unable to play with his children.

'The more low I felt, the less I went out,' he reveals. 'My children often asked me to take them to the park but I always made excuses not to.

'While I was losing weight, I decided I wanted to run the London Marathon to prove to people that fat people can run.

'I started off with a half mile run around the block and I had to stop six times. It has got a bit easier since then but there have been times I wanted to give up.

'This is why I am so grateful for the other members' support because without them I would have quit weeks ago.'

Paul's fellow class members will be completing a 26-mile run collectively to symbolise the miles Paul will cover in his London Marathon challenge.

He plans to join them for the first and last leg of the event, which starts at the Bucknall Road fitness studio in Stoke-on-Trent at 10am on Saturday March 22.

Personal trainer and fitness studio owner Rachael Hunt, 37, from Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'Paul's story is really inspirational.

'When he first came along to the group, he was very shy and was lacking confidence but now he's completely different. 

'We just want to do all we can to give him that final boost before he does the marathon. To some people, it is just a race but we know it means a lot more than that to Paul.'
