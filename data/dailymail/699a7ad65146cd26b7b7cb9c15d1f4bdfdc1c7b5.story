A Virginia court has ruled that the identities of seven anonymous reviewers who criticized a local carpet cleaning business must be revealed.

In a decision that will strike fear in the hearts of all anonymous online trolls, an Alexandria judge ruled on Tuesday that Yelp must comply with the demand of Joe Hadeed's attorneys and hand over the names of the reviewers.

Alexandria-based Hadeed Carpet Cleaning was the subject of several negative reviews on the site by anonymous authors - who Hadeed claims were not real customers of his business.

If he is correct and the customers are not genuine, Yelp's Terms of Service will have been violated, and the comments will not be protected under the First Amendment.

The case began in 2012 when several negative reviews were left on Hadeed Carpet's Yelp page, some claiming the company swindled customers, overcharging hundreds of dollars above the quoted price, while others said their carpets ended up looking worse than before they were cleaned.

Joe Hadeed could find no record that the reviewers were actual customers and sued the authors of seven negative reviews and subpoenaed Yelp for their identities.

According to the Courthouse News Service, Yelp refused several times and was help in contempt of court.

On Tuesday, the Virginia Court of Appeals agreed two to one, that Yelp must identify the anonymous reviewers.

Yelp's Terms of Service requires that reviewers must have been a customer of a business to leave a review.

The company does not require users to register with their full name, but does record the IP address of each review posted.

'The Virginia statute makes the judge a gatekeeper to decide whether or not thereâ€™s a common sense reason for someone in our position to get this information,' Raighne Delaney, a lawyer at the Arlington firm Bean, Kinney & Korman who represent Hadeed, told the Washington Times.

'In order for someone like Joe Hadeed to find out who these people are, he has to explain his case, and if he can convince the judge that there might be a real lawsuit against this person, the judge can then say, "Yes, you can get this information,"' said Delaney.

If the negative reviews were written by people who were never customers of Hadeed, he will sue for defamation.

The non-profit advocacy group Public Citizen that represents Yelp says reviewers should not have to reveal their identities when expressing opinions protected by the First Amendment and that Hadeed should have to at least prove that the reviews were false before the identities are handed over.

Yelp's lawyers say Hadeed did not meet nationwide standards necessary to uncover the anonymous users, but the court disagreed.

'Yelp said that all the posts had different IP addresses, but how many IP addresses does one person have between all their devices?' said Hadeedâ€™s attorney, Raighne Delaney, to the Washington Times. 'It would be easy to create a number of different fake accounts.'

In a 25-page majority opinion, Judge William G. Petty said, 'Generally, a Yelp review is entitled to First Amendment protection because it is a personâ€™s opinion about a business that they patronized.

'The anonymous speaker has the right to express himself on the Internet without the fear that his veil of anonymity will be pierced for no other reason than because another person disagrees with him,' Judge Petty wrote.

However, the court said that First Amendment rights do not cover deliberately false statements and agreed that Hadeed provided sufficient reason to believe the users may not have been customers of Hadeed Carpet Cleaning.
