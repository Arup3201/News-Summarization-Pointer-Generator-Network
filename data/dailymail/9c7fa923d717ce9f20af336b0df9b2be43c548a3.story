Think of Army grub and you may imagine tasteless, depressing stodge that would be best avoided. But, in fact, many military recipes are carefully developed to be easy, cost-effective and nutritious.

A new book, Bully Beef And Boiled Sweets, revisits British military meals since the First World War, revealing dishes and ingredients that nowadays rarely grace our dining tables.

Yet as a nutritional therapist, I can see how many of these meals do have a place in a modern healthy diet.

Rations: A typical selection of ingredients provided in wartime from which a cook would have to provide a nutritious meal

The book’s author, James Mannion, recalls that Napoleon said: ‘An army marches on its stomach.’ Well, that applies to anyone who battles through daily life – these recipes reflect our need for good-quality sustenance.

Among the meals’ merits  are a high provision of protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals. For example, just one serving of Woolton Pie – named after a wartime Minister of Food – provides an incredible four vegetable portions.

These meals are comforting, with such homemade appeal that children will love them.

They demonstrate not just the practical side of Army food – such as that wartime staple corned beef – but also the creativity rationing inspired.

Carrot fudge recalls the  days when sugar was scarce. People still wanted something sweet so turned to carrots instead, as they have a natural sweetness. Today you can use the recipe to make healthier treats for children.

Here I introduce five of my favourite low-cost wartime dishes from the book and explain why they deserve a place in your repertoire of recipes...

Bully Beef And Boiled Sweets, by James Mannion, is published  by Constable, priced £14.99. To order your copy at the special price of £13.49 with free p&p, call the  Mail Book Shop on 0844 472 4157 or go to mailbookshop.co.uk.
