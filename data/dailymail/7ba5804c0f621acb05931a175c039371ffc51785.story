There are two options open to Chris Avalos when he enters the cauldron of Belfast’s Odyssey Arena this Saturday night to challenge Carl Frampton for the super-bantamweight championship of the world.

‘Fight or flight,’ says Frampton. ‘It’s up to him.

‘I hope it’s fight because that will be more entertaining for the fans and better for me.

‘But this is the hottest atmosphere for any sporting event in Ireland these days and there’s no telling which way my opponents will react when it hits them.’

Frampton is optimistic that Avalos, an archetypal Mexican-American warrior by reputation, is coming to play his part in a spectacle which will carry the fanaticism for The Jackal across to mainland Britain as well as expand the audience for boxing in this country.

The excitement surrounding Frampton has encouraged ITV to bring prize-fighting back to mainstream terrestrial television here for the first time in almost a decade.

It gives Frampton’s promoter and mentor – Belfast’s legendary former world champion Barry McGuigan – the chance to generate wider public interest in his protege not just in Britain but around the world.

This fight is being broadcast live in 55 other countries, including the United States where expectation is mounting for a title unification match between Frampton and Cuba’s ex-amateur genius Guillermo Rigondeaux.

Before travelling to America, Frampton is more than willing to hop over to Manchester this summer to put his IBF belt on the line in a battle of Britain with Bury’s ‘regular’ WBA champion Scott Quigg.

Both those fights have the potential to elevate Frampton from Belfast folk hero to global stardom but he knows that depends, firstly, on a stellar performance against Avalos.

‘I’m under no illusions about this,’ he says. ‘I’m on the brink of something big now. I can’t afford any slip-ups at this stage and I need to continue to impress. There’s too much at stake.’

In that realisation Frampton has worked harder than ever under his trainer, McGuigan’s son Shane, in the intense confines of their gym in London’s increasingly fashionable Battersea.

At just turned 28 – last Saturday - and with13 KO’s in his perfect 19-win record – he stands ready to deliver again.

‘I’m pretty confident of knocking Avalos out,’ he says thoughtfully, without bombast. ‘He’s a very good fighter and I expect him to be tougher than Quigg when we get round to that one. Certainly more aggressive. But because he usually comes on the offensive and leaves himself open to be hit I do think I will stop him.’

Frampton has put in more than 200 rounds of sparring against high-quality fighters, some of them markedly bigger than himself. With none of them proving able to go 12 rounds with him, that chore has been shared among them when he insists boxing the full championship distance.

It is not only to ensure victory over Avalos, his mandatory challenger, that Frampton is living the Spartan life demanded of all who would be great champions.

‘My ambition is not celebrity but to become acknowledged as the best super-bantamweight,’ he says. ‘And at some point soon that will mean beating not only Quigg but Rigondeaux, who everyone considers the greatest and I understand why at the moment.

‘Then, if I can do that, I will move up in weight in the hope that being a two-division world champion might be enough for me to be elected to the Hall of Fame.’ 

Frampton would like to add a win over WBC super-bantamweight belt holder, Leo Santa Cruz, to that resume but that US-based Mexican no longer appears as willing to face him as Avalos.

Since joining the growing stable of top fighters in advisor Al Haymon’s stable, Santa Cruz has not only veered away from a big fight with Rigondeaux but also seems to be losing enthusiasm for taking on Frampton in either a Belfast stadium or in America.

That increases the demands on Frampton to impress this weekend and then, probably, against Quigg in early summer. But he says: ‘I’m used to the pressure because I know I carry so many hopes for Belfast and Ulster with me into the ring.’

Frampton’s title-winning triumph over Kiko Martinez drew a 20,000 crowd to an open-air pop-arena in the historic dockyards where the Titanic was constructed – drawn from both sides of the sectarian divide, with men, women and children united in their vociferous support for this young Protestant who is happily married to a Catholic.

But it is within the confines of the Odyssey that they raise the roof.

Expect the crescendo to come with Frampton landing his KO in or near the eighth round.

Frampton v Avalos is live on ITV1 from 10pm, preceded by the undercard on ITV4.
