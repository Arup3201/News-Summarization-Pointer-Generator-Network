Sucker punched: A 22-year-old man was knocked out with a single punch during a random attack in Rochdale, Greater Manchester at 3am Sunday morning

The 22-year-old, seen wearing a red t-shirt, fell unconscious onto the pavement and sustained serious head injuries.

These images show how the attacker punches him in the face before leisurely strolling off with his hands in his pockets.

The man turns momentarily to look back, and as shocked passers-by tend to the victim, he disappears into the crowds.

Today
Greater Manchester Police issued the CCTV footage of the attack in the 
hope the man will be identified and turned in.

The incident took place at about 3.20am on Sunday, December 8, as the unnamed victim was stood outside Yates’ on Packer Street.

Out cold: The punch leaves the victim unconcious and he falls slap-bang onto the street

Knocked out: The 22-year-old suffered severe head injuries after hitting the back of his head on the pavement - the attacker can be seen walking away, right

As this image shows, there were several witnesses to the incident in Rochdale, and as shocked passers by came to the young man's aid, the attacker strolls away with his hands in his pockets

Police
said the attacker was with a group of women when he approached his 
victim and without warning then struck him in the face. The force of the
blow knocked the man unconscious and he fell to the ground, banging his
head.

He was taken to 
hospital for treatment to his injuries that included stitches to his 
face and treatment to swelling to his head. He has since been discharged from hospital.

Det
Con Chris Whalley, said: ‘While the victim has suffered serious 
injuries, it is not an understatement to say he could have died as a 
result of this violent and seemingly unprovoked assault.

‘I want the public to look closely at the CCTV and if they recognise the person responsible to contact us immediately. We also need to speak to the women he was with and I am again appealing for information as to her identity.

‘I
would encourage these two, if they see this appeal to come forward as 
it will only be a matter of time before we come for you.

The incident is similar to the death or Wesley Clutterbuck, a 19-year-old Royal Marine who died from his head injuries after he was punched in the face by 20-year-old Reece Kay, now serving four years for manslaughter

‘With
the festive party season in full swing I also want to remind people 
that just a single punch can prove fatal, as was demonstrated with the 
tragic death of Wesley Clutterbuck in Rochdale in June this year.

‘There
is a temptation to drink more than usual at this time of the year and 
if are going out please drink responsibly. You do not want to end up 
ruining your life by ending someone else’s in a moment of madness.’

The case is similar to that of Royal Marine Wesley Clutterbuck, 19, who was killed with a single punch in June this year.

Marine Clutterbuck had tried to break up a fight in Rochdale town centre after being granted home leave to attend a funeral.

He fell to the floor and suffered fatal head injuries. Attacker Reece Kay, 20, is now serving four years for manslaughter.
