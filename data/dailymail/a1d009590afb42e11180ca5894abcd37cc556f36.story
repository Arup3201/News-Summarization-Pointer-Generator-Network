The hand of friendship extended down the paddock on Thursday, one Brit to another — world champion to world champion — when Lewis Hamilton told McLaren they do not need a new driver but a new car.

It was some kind of balm to Jenson Button as he sat in Interlagos, the place where he once spent the happiest moment of his life — hugging his father after winning the title in 2009 — but now contemplating the end of his Formula One career.

Button is about to be released by McLaren to be replaced by Fernando Alonso after the final race in Abu Dhabi in a fortnight, hence he can hardly understand it, having outscored his team-mate Kevin Magnussen 94-53.

Lewis Hamilton won the US Grand Prix with ease last week and looks set to win the drivers' championship 

But Eric Boullier, McLaren’s racing director, wants a blend of youth — Magnussen is 22 — and experience. Alonso is 34 and a double world champion.

Hamilton, who spent three years with Button as McLaren team-mates, was equally astonished by the news. 

He said: ‘JB’s going? Really? Surely Jenson can go anywhere? Jenson is better than most of the drivers. 

'He’s a great driver. He’s had an amazing career and he’s still one of the strongest drivers here, so it doesn’t correlate. If I had a team, I would want him in it. He’s a great asset.

‘He’s smart and fast. He’s also just a decent guy. He’s still got plenty of time as a driver to keep racing and winning.

Hamilton has backed Button to remain at McLaren and says they should change the car rather than him

‘He just needs to be given a better car. It’s not that the team need a better driver. There are not many out there.’

The two men are not bosom friends and Button has had cause to be annoyed by Hamilton’s erratic behaviour in the past, but there is mutual respect between them as racers.

Will Hamilton’s endorsement change anyone’s mind at McLaren? Even if it did, would Button want to stay?

‘I can’t answer that question,’ said Button, hinting at an irrevocable breakdown in relations with the team.

‘When you’re put in a position that many drivers have been put in over the years it opens your eyes to different challenges, whether it’s racing, doing another sport or something altogether different.

‘I’m excited about the challenges ahead. I have a lot of different ideas.

‘Formula One and motor racing have been a massive part of my life and it’s not going to stop. I just don’t know where that’s going to be right now. 

'I never feel like I’m being pushed out of the sport because I’m definitely going to be in the sport in some form.’

Button, 34, clearly wants to race, and not primarily for the seven-figure salary he would command with one of the big teams — Audi, Porsche or Toyota — in the World Endurance Championship, which is his most likely refuge.

That would allow him to combine his driving commitments with broadcasting on Formula One, although he seems uninterested in a television career at the moment.

More than anything he wants a winning car, something McLaren have not provided him with since their last victory two years ago to this very race.

‘We are not winning races,’ he said. ‘When Lewis and I were team-mates, we were winning seven or eight between us every year. Now we don’t have a car that is quick enough. The team know that and that is why we are working bloody hard to improve.

‘It isn’t going to stop until the last race; we have new parts for Abu Dhabi which will hopefully help the car. Two years of not winning is too long.’

Button’s departure will reduce the number of British drivers, possibly to just one: Hamilton. Max Chilton’s Marussia team are in administration and although they are hopeful of finding investors, there is no guarantee he would keep his place. Several drivers bring sponsorship to pay for their drives, as Chilton does.

‘It is worrying,’ said Button, who earns about £10million against Magnussen’s £500,000.

‘There are fewer and fewer teams hiring drivers on pure talent. Unless you have a big bucket of gold, you are not going to get into Formula One and that has been proved by some of the signings we have seen for next season.

‘Obviously the manufacturers hire on merit, but after that it is a case of money talks rather than skill.

‘That is sad considering it is the pinnacle of motorsport.’

Button spoke like the elder statesman of the sport he is. He might be bitter at his treatment by McLaren, but otherwise he was content as he talked about his future and his past with a smile on his face.
