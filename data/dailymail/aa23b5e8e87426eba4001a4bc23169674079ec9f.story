She’s the mother of a gunman who shot dead five Amish schoolgirls and seriously injured another five, before turning the pistol on himself.

Charles Roberts, 32, burst into a school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in October 2006 in an horrific mass murder that shocked the world.

Five years on Terri Roberts recalls crawling into a foetal position when she heard her son had committed ‘the worst crime imaginable’.

Five years on: Charles Roberts, 32, burst into an Amish school in Pennsylvania in October 2006 in an horrific mass murder that shocked the world

Her son allegedly admitted to his wife just minutes before the killings that he had sexually assaulted two young female relatives when he was 12.

Roberts was a father-of-three when he shot ten schoolgirls in the rural county, killing five and seriously wounding the other five.

In an extraordinary show of reconciliation, his mother regularly visits an 11-year-old schoolgirl who was paralysed by her son's attacks.

‘As we reach out in ways that bring a touch, we can find great healing,’ Mrs Roberts told Religion News Service.

When Mrs 
Robertsheard about the massacre she crawled into a foetal position and her husband Chuck cried into a
tea towel, she recalled.

‘Not
only was my son not alive, he was the perpetrator of the worst crime 
anyone could ever imagine,’ she told Religion News Service.

'We had a son who did not have peace in his life.'

She said the counsellor helped her avoid a life of ‘total darkness and sorrow’ by only thinking of the shooting as a tiny part of her son’s life.

Three months after the massacre she started to visit victims and invited surviving girls and their mothers to picnics at her home.

But she still recalls a suicide note left by her son that said he hated God after his first child died soon after birth, reported Religion News Service.

Roberts was haunted by the death of his first-born daughter Elise Victoria, who lived for only 20 minutes after a premature birth in 1997.

He had chained the girls together in a line at the blackboard and barricaded the doors after sending the boys and adults away.

‘Have you seen anything like this?’ he allegedly asked the terrified pupils, showing them his 9mm Springfield Arms semi-automatic pistol.

But he also went with a shotgun, 
bolt-action sports rifle, a stun gun, gunpowder, knives, binoculars, 
wrenches, a hose, candles and torches.

What Charles Roberts asked pupils, showing his pistol

The dead girls were Naomi Rose Ebersole, 7; Anna Mae Stoltzfus, 12; Marian Fisher, 13; and sisters Mary Liz Miller, 8; and Lina Miller, 7.

Their parents had no photographs to remember them by, because the Amish shun modern gadgetry such as cameras.

Roberts's wife Marie, aged 28 at the time of the shooting, described her husband as ‘loving, supportive and thoughtful’ and a great father.
