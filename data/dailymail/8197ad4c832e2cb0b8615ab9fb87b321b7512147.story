It was his deathbed interview, and a yellow-faced Chopper Read, Australia's most notorious underworld figure, had some bombshells to drop. 

A little over a fortnight before he died of liver cancer in October 2013, Read sat down for an interview with 60 Minutes and revealed he had been responsible for four cold-blooded killings.

He was remorseless. Claimed he didn't feel anything when he killed people.  No surge of adrenalin. No rush.

And the man who once said 'You put a camera in front of me... I'll lie my head off' insisted he was telling the truth. 

'That's what it's all about, the last interview, the last picture show,' he said. 'I'm telling the truth now.'

Notorious: Chopper Read, who had his own ears cut off in an attempt to be shifted out of a maximum security prison, was Australia's most infamous underworld figure. 

'Deathbed confessional': Dying of liver cancer, Read appeared sick and yellow-faced in his final interview with 60 Minutes last year. In the interview he confessed to four murders. 

He wanted to be like Ned Kelly: Chopper's body was riddled with tattoos at the end. 

Resemblance: Eric Bana played Chopper in the self-named film, released in the year 2000.

MYTH #1: He blowtorched people's feet and snipped toes off with boltcutters

Adam Shand writes: 'He had never chopped anyone's toes off with a set of boltcutters, nor had he ever applied a blowtorch to anyone's feet. 

'That had all been borrowed from the legend of Linus Patrick 'Jimmy The Pom' Driscoll.'

MYTH #2: He killed Sidney Collins, a missing Queensland bikie boss

Adam Shand writes: '(Friends) Mark Dixon and Jacko dismissed the confessions as a grab for a final payday.

'He had been nowhere near Casino when Sid Collins had disappeared, they said.'

MYTH #3: He killed notorious paedophile Reginald Isaacs

Adam Shand writes: 'It is highly likely that Read and Hegyalji had nothing to do with Isaacs' death, yet in the years to come, Read would 'confess' hundreds of times that he and Mad Charlie had murdered Isaacs.

'He would run a dozen different versions in books, shows and interviews, all of them factually impossible, of how they had slain the monster of D Division'.

MYTH #4: He killed Desmond Costello, a union heavyweight

Adam Shand writes: 'There was no hard evidence linking Read to those killings... nothing more than his say-so, or he would have been arrested long ago.'

His confessions came as little shock to the many Australians who thought of 'Uncle Chop Chop' as a badass -  a murderous, but strangely familiar, character.

But, like many of Chopper's stories, there was little evidence. For three of the four murders, the only proof was his word.

The interview was one last effort at cementing the myth of Chopper. 

And it was a missed opportunity to tell the truth about it all, author and journalist Adam Shand argues in a new book, The Real Chopper: The Man Behind The Legend.

'He didn't have the courage to tell people that finally, a lot of what he was saying for the last umpteen years was rubbish,' Mr Shand told Daily Mail Australia. 

Chopper, who spent 23 years and nine months in prison, 'wasn't nearly as bad as he said he was', Mr Shand said.

'He was a most unremarkable crook.'  

His tall tales of murder, all based on his say-so, were likely too incredible to be real. 

Mr Shand wrote that Chopper's associates, Mark Dixon and Mark 'Jacko' Jackson, 'dismissed the confessions as a grab for a final payday'. 

They said Chopper was 'nowhere near' Casino, NSW, at the time he was said to have killed Queensland bikie boss Sidney Collins in 2002.

Mr Shand also told Daily Mail Australia that Chopper he was only a teenager in 1971, when he was supposed to have murdered union heavyweight Desmond Costello - an unlikely proposition.

And as for his apparent murder of notorious paedophile Reg Isaacs in jail, in the mid-70s? 

'His story doesn't match (the facts) at all,' Mr Shand told Daily Mail Australia.

There's only proof he was behind the deaths one of his alleged victims: Drug dealer Sammy 'The Turk' Ozekam, who was gunned down outside Bojangles Nightclub in St Kilda, Melbourne, in 1987. 

Chopper was acquitted of his murder after pleading self-defence.

Likewise, Mr Shand wrote that Chopper's stories of chopping of toes, torture and blowtorching people's feet weren't grounded in reality. 

The tagline of Bana's movie was 'Never let the truth get in the way of a good yarn'.

Victims? In his final interview, Chopper Read claimed he murdered union heavy Desmond Costello (left) and Sidney Collins (right), a Queensland bikie boss.

In his prime: Chopper worked as an informer for Victoria's Armed Robbery Squad in 1986 - 87.

If anything, Chopper appears to have been a lousy crook. Whether it was armed robbery, impersonating a police officer or killing Sammy The Turk, 'just about everything he ever did, he was caught for,' Mr Shand said.

And while he often said his motto was Never Plead Guilty, Chopper, who would spend 23 years and nine months behind bars, almost always did. 

'He would open up like a watermelon falling off a truck,' Mr Shand wrote. 

But he had a glorious imagination, which grew out of his love of cowboy tales and gangster yarns as a child.

He had something of a lonely childhood - his mother, a devout Seventh Day Adventist, was a 'religious zealot'.

He developed an ambition to become a household name similar to those other legends of Australian criminal history, Ned Kelly and 1920s Melbourne gangster Squizzy Taylor.

And that's what he became. 

He first felt the glow of infamy when, imprisoned in the notorious maximum security H Division wing of Pentridge Prison in the 1970s, he convinced a fellow inmate to cut his ears off in order to get him shifted out.

Everyone slashed their wrists, Mr Shand wrote. Chopper, however, needed to do something more dramatic. 

And while the extent of his biggest crimes are questionable, many of his bizarre antics were the stuff of truth.

He audaciously tried to kidnap a County Court judge in 1978. And he once spooned two or three tablespoons of faeces into the prisoners' stew at Pentridge Prison. As you can imagine, it made him a lot of enemies.

Read was a devoted dad to his two sons, Charlie (pictured) and Roy. 

Father figure: Read promised wife Margaret he would never return to crime.

 

The myth around Chopper ballooned in the 1990s after the publication of some of Chopper's 'diaries'. 

And then it appeared to spin out of control. 

Australians have purchased more than 500,000 copies of his books, according to an ABC report.  Plus there was Eric Bana's feature film, which hit the big screen in 2000.

Mr Shand, who followed Chopper's case for years, trawled through his prison file and interrogated his friends and enemies, told Daily Mail Australia that in reality, Chopper was just a fraction of the myth he created.

'I would say there's about ten per cent truth,' he said.

He said Mark Read - devoted father of his two boys, Roy and Charlie - became imprisoned by the myth of Chopper. 

'Everyone wants to be famous... He craved fame, he craved acceptance,' Mr Shand said. 

'Mark Brandon Read, was not prepared to step outside the cartoon character and say, "Here I am!"

'(Even in his books) he gives you big, juicy hints some of this wasn't all quite right. But we all sort of chose to ignore thos'

'He told people he never cut people's toes off with a pair of boltcutters. Really he was just giving people what they wanted.   

Earlier this month, Chopper Read posthumously won the 'Best Supporting Actor' gong at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival for a role he played in the comedy Start Options Exit'.

It was a strangely appropriate tribute, Mr Shand said. 'I think he's been acting his whole life,' he told Daily Mail Australia, 'So it's not surprising'.
