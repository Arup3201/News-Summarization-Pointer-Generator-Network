A damning report from the Australian Human Rights Commission has found that hundreds of children threatened to or committed self harm in immigration detention.

In a ten-month long inquiry, the Commission found that Australia's practice of holding children in detention violates human rights law, and recommended that they should be released as soon as possible into the community.

The long-awaited report, titles 'The Forgotten Children', called for a royal commission into the treatment of children in immigration detention after concluding that prolonged detainment caused significant mental and physical harm.

The Australian Human Rights Commission has found that hundreds of children threatened to or committed self harm in immigration detention

Hundreds of assaults against children were reported and 128 teenagers harmed themselves between January 2013 and March 2014.

Commission President Gillian Triggs said that the Australian government's amendments to the Migration Act which redefined the term 'refugee' was of 'profound concern'.

'It is imperative that Australian governments never again use the lives of children to achieve political or strategic advantage,' she said.

'The aims of stopping people smugglers and deaths at sea do not justify the cruel and illegal means adopted,' she told SBS.

'Australia is better than this.'

The report stated that 'there appears to be no rational explanation for the prolonged detention of children.'

The report, released on Wednesday, stated that 'The mandatory and prolonged immigration detention of children is in clear violation of international human rights law.'

The commission called for the Federal government to ban indefinite detention, close the 'harsh and cramped' Christmas Island immigration centre, get children off Nauru and appoint an independent guardian for unaccompanied minors.

However, Attorney-General George Brandis told parliament that the recommendations had been a longstanding point of difference between the government and the commission.

'The government does not accept the commission's findings,' he said.

Mr Brandis said that the Federal government had made 'significant progress' towards changing the conditions of detention centres since the Commission's inquiry had started.

'In short, children in detention is a problem created exclusively by the former Labor Government, which has largely been solved by the current Abbott Government,' he told SBS.

Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said the report must be the turning point to end the cruel practice of locking children in detention camps

GetUp Campaigns Chief Erin McCallum said that the findings of the report were concerning.

'Whatever your political persuasion, locking up innocent kids in hideous detention camps is barbaric and it has to stop,' she said. 

Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said the report must be the turning point to end the cruel practice of locking children in detention camps.

'This vile, institutionalised child abuse has to end,' she said in a statement.

'No longer can we turn a blind eye to the sexual, physical and psychological abuse that these policies of indefinite detention are inflicting on children.' 

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton - who only took on the job in late December - said many of the recommendations reflected existing government policies and were superfluous.

Activist group ChilOut said children must only be detained as a measure of last resort and only for the shortest appropriate period

'Other recommendations would mean undermining the very policies that mean children don't get on boats in the first place,' he said in a statement.

Numbers of children in immigration detention peaked at nearly 2000 in mid-2013 under Labor but now there are only 162 children still detained. 

Activist group ChilOut said children must only be detained as a measure of last resort and only for the shortest appropriate period.

'This report highlights our dramatic failure to uphold our obligations, by detaining children arbitrarily as punishment for seeking asylum,' it said in a statement.

Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles said Labor would work through the report findings and recommendations and respond appropriately.

'The best thing we can do for children in detention is to have refugee claims processed quickly so nobody has to languish in detention with no hope of settlement,' he said in a statement.
