Sheryl Sandberg has tumbled down the list of most powerful businesswomen despite launching a book telling women to do more in the workplace.

The chief operating officer of Facebook dropped from fifth to 10th in the annual rankings by Fortune Magazine.

In spite of being the most highly paid female executive on the list, the editors felt that her influence and power diminished over the past 12 months.

Last year Sandberg, 45, published ‘Lean In’ which was her call to arms for women to achieve their full potential.

Losing popularity?Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, has slipped from fifth place to 10th in Fortune's annual 'World's Most Powerful Women' list. She is the most highly paid exec on the list

But critics lambasted her as being out of touch and with no idea about the reality of the workplace given that she earns £23 million a year.

To compile its list Fortune analysed the importance of each woman in the global economy and their business, the arc of their career and their cultural influence.

This meant that even though Facebook’s profits jumped 2,730 per cent last year and it made major acquisitions like virtual reality firm Oculus VR for £1.2 billion, Sandberg’s personal value went down. 

Another big loser was Marissa Mayer who slipped from 8th to 16th amid lingering questions over the real value of Yahoo, of which she is chief executive and president.

Mayer, 39, also sparked huge controversy by telling staff they could not work from home because it was bad for the business.

At the same time she built a nursery next to her office which made it easier for her to balance motherhood with her career.

It later emerged she made the decision after spying on employee logins to see how much they were slacking off.

The most powerful businesswoman in the world is Ginni Rommety, 57, the chief executive of IBM, according to Fortune.

She took the top spot for a third year in a row even though IBM’s revenue fell.
