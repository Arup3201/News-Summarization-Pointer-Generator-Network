Caitlin Hunt who died after being 'knocked off her scooter' and hit by a bus

A nine-year-old schoolgirl who died after being ‘knocked off her scooter’ and hit by a bus has been described as ‘popular’ by friends and teachers.

Caitlin Hunt was believed to be out on her scooter with her brother, Aidan, 10, and a friend when she was struck by the single decker Thamesdown Bus in front of a row of shops in Swindon, Wiltshire, yesterday.

Police are still investigating the 
collision which occurred at around 5.50pm just yards from Rodbourne Cheney Primary School, where Caitlin was a pupil.

Paramedics 
battled to save her life but she died at the scene. It is believed the 
collision was witnessed by her brother and a young friend who were 
playing with Caitlin at the time.

Today, dozens of floral tributes, cards and teddy bears could be seen at the scene of the crash.

Caitlin's mother Claire Hunt, 42, visited the scene to look at the growing mound of floral tributes.The pregnant mother hugged emotional friends and family members as she read the touching tributes.One note, from a friend of the schoolgirl, said: 'Dear Caitlin, I really REALLY miss you. If only you could still be here. And by the way you gave me your bug so I have been off school for day. Lots of misses, Lauren.'

Fellow pupils and teachers at Rodbourne Cheney Primary School also paid tribute to ‘popular’ Caitlin, 
who has been described as ‘a vibrant and passionate learner’.

In a statement released on behalf of the
 whole school, Rodbourne Cheney principle Denise Lyon said: ‘It was with
 great regret and sadness that we heard of the tragic death of one of 
our pupils, Caitlin Hunt, last night.

 a year four pupil, was a vibrant and passionate learner at Rodbourne

noticeable.

sense of loss and tragedy, which is being felt by Caitlin's family at

 loss will also be felt within the school by pupils, staff and parents 
and we are grateful for the pastoral support being offered by the local
