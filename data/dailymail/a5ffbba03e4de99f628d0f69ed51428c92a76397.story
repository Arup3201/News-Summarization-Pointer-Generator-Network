When the fixtures for each new season were published, one of the first games I would look for was Newcastle away.

Once I knew the dates of the Merseyside derby and the showdowns with Manchester United, I would make a point of finding out when Liverpool would go to St James’ Park as it was always one of the best away days of the season.

For starters, more often than not we would come away with three points; I had a good record at St James’ Park — I won seven of the 14 matches I played there in the  Premier League — but it was also one of my favourite arenas.

The atmosphere set it apart. You could feel it on the bus ride in, when you would see thousands of fans in those black-and-white shirts lining the street to give you some stick. We used to have a good laugh about it on the coach.

Under pressure: Alan Pardew has been the subject of intense criticism from Newcastle fans and local media

I loved 
the passion of the Newcastle fans. It was the same with Sunderland. 
Whenever I was up in the North East,  I always thought they were two 
clubs you would love to play for.

That
 passion, though, would leave both teams vulnerable. Newcastle, for 
instance, would always fly out of the blocks but we would sit back, soak
 up the pressure, then pick them off on the counter-attack.

Nobody
 could ever accuse North East football of lacking emotion but that, at 
times, is a hindrance and Newcastle manager Alan Pardew was right when 
he explained earlier this season how fans can get too high or too low, 
depending on results. It does nothing to help with stability.

Looking
 on from afar at Newcastle and Sunderland, I have constantly been left 
scratching my head. Both clubs have all the elements you need for 
success — first-class stadiums, excellent training grounds, huge fan 
base — yet, they always seem one step from turmoil.

Take
 Newcastle. Though they lost their first game 4-0 at Manchester City, 
not at any stage have they been threatened by relegation and haven’t 
been lower than ninth since last autumn, reaching a high of fifth place 
on November 30.

Given
 they flirted with the drop last season then began with that drubbing at
 the Etihad Stadium, having failed to make a permanent summer signing, I
 expected them to be fighting relegation. That they haven’t is credit to
 Pardew.

Yet
 he is under attack, from fans and, most worryingly, the local media. I 
remember when the Liverpool Echo turned against Gerard Houllier and Roy 
Hodgson. Once a manager loses the faith of those you would expect to be 
sympathetic, it is very difficult to get back onside.

Newcastle
 have been on a dreadful run, losing their last four games by an 
aggregate of 12-0, giving Pardew’s critics ammunition, but he has been 
compromised by the injury to his leading scorer, Loic Remy, who has been
 out since March 1.

Given
 the circumstances in which he has been forced to work — Remy only came 
in late on loan then his best player, Yohan Cabaye, was sold in January 
without being replaced — Pardew has done well this  season, and overall 
he’s done a very good job in the three-and-a-half years he has been 
there considering he has one of the lowest net spends in the Premier 
League.

Message: Newcastle fans in the away end at Stoke hold up a banner aimed at Pardew

Loud and clear: Some Newcastle fans have called for Pardew's exit from the club

Make
 a comparison with Southampton. They and Newcastle are the only teams 
who you would describe as being consistently mid-table; Mauricio 
Pochettino is getting praise, and rightly so, but Newcastle haven’t 
spent their money.

Newcastle
 are bigger than Southampton and should be aspiring to be better than 
them; they should not have gone 15 years without appearing in a domestic
 cup final but until Mike Ashley really invests, it will be difficult to
 do anything other than tread water. 

Southampton
 have also had a flurry of young players coming through and it amazes me
 that part of the North East, given its size, has not produced any 
exciting young talents. What happened to finding the next Chris Waddle, 
Alan Shearer or Paul Gascoigne? Newcastle and Liverpool are 
similar-sized cities with the same intensity for football but how can no
 young kids emerge up there while we’ve produced Steven Gerrard and 
Wayne Rooney, while this season Ross Barkley and Jon Flanagan have come 
to prominence?

Loss: Newcastle have been without striker Loic Remy since March

Switch: Yohan Cabaye, who was the heart of Newcastle's midfield, moved to Paris Saint-Germain

Why
 don’t Newcastle — or Sunderland — have young lads coming through? Both 
used a director of football this season but whereas Joe Kinnear didn’t 
buy enough, Roberto De Fanti bought too many before he was sacked in 
January.

Sunderland,
 with eight defeats in 10 games, are doomed barring a miracle but their 
relegation has been coming; their turnover of players and managers in 
recent years has been bewildering and success doesn’t breed in 
unpredictable environments.

Gus
 Poyet has had enough time to save Sunderland — compare what Tony Pulis 
has done at Crystal Palace in a shorter period — but there is no doubt 
he walked into a difficult job at a difficult club to manage.

Competition: Southampton are two points ahead of Newcastle in eighth place in the Premier League

Arrival: Jon Flanagan and Ross Barkley are the latest talented youngsters to emerge from Merseyside

In
 many ways, you could say the same about Newcastle. They tried to 
promote the idea that they want stability but all they succeeded in 
doing when giving Pardew an eight-year contract was invite cynicism.

The
 North East, with its rich history, has given us names that will stand 
the test of time; we will never forget Sir Bobby Robson, Kevin Keegan’s 
brilliant attacking side of 1995-96 or the Sunderland team that, against
 the odds, won the FA Cup in 1973.

To
 see it now, with both clubs in differing states of turmoil, is a 
crying shame. It should be a football hotbed, not a place that is stuck
 in the wilderness.

Doomed: Sunderland are bottom of the Premier League and look set for relegation to the Championship

To the heavens: Gus Poyet insisted he will not quit as Sunderland boss despite relegation looming

Bale and pace no laughing matter for defenders

My sympathies lay with Marc Bartra on Wednesday night when Gareth Bale turned on his afterburners and raced away.

I knew exactly how the Barcelona defender would have felt as Bale’s change of gear reminded me of the night I gave a hopeless chase to Thierry Henry. He actually ran off the pitch, back on again and still flew away from me!

Nothing worries you more as a defender than raw pace and the speed of Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo could be the difference when Real Madrid go head-to-head with Bayern Munich for a place in the Champions League final. Bayern are susceptible to counter-attacks, as they are a possession team who play with their full backs high and wide.

Flying high: Gareth Bale celebrates his wonder goal for Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final

Pace: The Welshman was too fast for Marc Bartra as he left him for dead on the way to scoring

Real, who have been quietly building a head of steam in Europe, have the players to exploit them.

If
 Carlo Ancelotti’s side do progress, it will be more difficult against 
Chelsea or Atletico Madrid as neither of those sides will play into 
their hands, but I have had a feeling for a while this might be Real’s 
year at long last.

Threat: Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo could fire Real Madrid to Champions League glory

Many
 wondered how Bale would fare after he made his world-record move last 
summer from Tottenham but his numbers have been excellent and the goal 
to clinch the Copa del Rey was his 20th of the season.

It
 is great to see Bale excel at the Bernabeu and he will now be hoping to
 emulate Steve McManaman, the last British winger to play for Real, and 
lead them to that elusive 10th European Cup.
