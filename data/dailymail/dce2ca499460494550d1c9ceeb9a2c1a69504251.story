Misguided teen: Skylar Murphy, 18, brought a pipe bomb to Edmonton International Airport

An 18-year-old man caught at Edmonton International Airport with a pipe bomb but was permitted to fly has been sentenced only to probation.

Skylar Murphy, from suburban Edmonton, was caught Sept 20 by security screeners with a pipe bomb – he was then allowed to board an international flight.

A source told MailOnline that he pleaded to the court that he simply forgot the bomb was in his bag and didn't mean to bring it to the airport.

The misguided teen received one year of probation, was order to pay $500 to the burn unit of a local hospital and also a $100 fine, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Black powder and a pipe bomb were found in Mr Murphy’s luggage by Canadian Air Transport Security Authority screeners, but they did not detain him or immediately alert authorities because they are not permitted to, according to a CATSA official.

‘Screening officers do not have the authority to apprehend or detain passengers,’ CATSA spokesman Mathieu Larocque told the CBC in a statement. ‘When they see something potentially illegal, the(y) contact the police.’

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were not contacted until four days later, Mr Murphy was arrested when returned to Edmonton Sept 27.

The lax approach to ensuring the safety of fliers infuriated the country’s top transportation official.

‘This individual should not have been allowed to board his flight, and it is unacceptable that CATSA waited four days before seeking the RCMP’s assistance,’ Transport Minister Lisa Raitt told the National Post.

Mr Larocque declined to comment further about the incident, saying only that ‘for security reasons, I can’t go into details about our procedures at the checkpoint, which include our protocols with the police.’

'A breakdown': A CATSA spokesperson told MailOnline there was a breakdown in security procedures - 'we should have called the police... we didn't'

Mr Larocque separately admitted to MailOnline that was a procedural breakdown.

'We saw something unusual in his bag… we should have called the police right away, we didn’t.'

A call to the RCMP’s Edmonton Airport detachment was shuffled to an airport spokesperson. The RCMP officer who answered the phone said Mounties are not publicly commenting on the incident.

An airport spokesperson also declined to comment. A message left with the Crown Prosecutor's office was not returned.

The lack of public comment on the incident has not gone unnoticed.

‘Everyone is dodging the bullet,’ a security expert told CTV. ‘No one wants to take responsibility for what is obviously a series of mistakes.’

Except for Mr Murphy, he pleaded guilty last month to possession of an explosive substance.

Edmonton is the eighth busiest airport in Canada with just over one million passengers per year.
