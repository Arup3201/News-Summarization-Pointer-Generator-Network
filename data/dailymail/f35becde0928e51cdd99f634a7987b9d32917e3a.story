With their laidback style and down-to-earth tastes, they are the epitome of the modern royal couple.And it seems Zara and Mike Tindall have a modern weakness for the latest gadgetry to match.

The Queen’s granddaughter and her rugby-playing husband are addicted to buying hi-tech TVs, phones and sound systems, he has revealed.

And in a further break from tradition, the former England rugby captain said he always carries £100 in his wallet ‘just in case’ – unlike the senior Royals, who famously never carry cash.

Tindall, 35, married 33-year-old Phillips – who is 15th in line for the throne – in 2011. Their daughter, Mia, was born six months ago.

In a detailed interview about his finances, Tindall told The Sunday Times that his biggest money weakness was for buying gadgets.

He said: ‘I like TVs, sound systems, and a nice cinema room where it’s all wired in properly. We always upgrade quickly with tablets and smartphones.’ 

Tindall said that he only recently got a credit card because he likes to spend money which is in his account.

He added: ‘I am very conscious about money, spending only what I have. That was always the way when I started professional rugby.

‘Then again, if I know the money is there, I like to enjoy myself.’ 

Shortly after his wedding, Tindall was spotted kissing a blonde woman on a night out during the rugby world cup in New Zealand.

He later claimed she was just an ‘old friend’ and Phillips stood by her husband. Last year, the pair sold their home in Cheltenham for £1.25million and moved in to a house on the Gatcombe Park estate, owned by her mother the Princess Royal.

Tindall, who earns a ‘six-figure’ sum as a player and coach at Gloucester rugby club and from celebrity endorsements, said he also has flats in Bath and Dubai which he lets out.

But he said his best investment was the racehorse Monbeg Dude, which came seventh in this year’s Grand National.

After buying it for £12,000 in 2010 with two friends at a charity auction, he admitted he never meant to win the bid.

But he revealed: ‘He’s won £120,000 in prize money since. If we sold him he’d probably be worth at least £200,000. Not bad. He was an accidental purchase, but he’s done all right for us.’ 

He revealed his worst investment was when he started a Poker gambling company in 2004, which lost £20,000.

Asked to name his financial priority, Tindall said: ‘Family, making sure we’re all right for the future. We’ve just had Mia, so school fees come into it, college, a wedding.

‘If you can keep filling Isas each year with a high-risk investments returning 10 per cent or 15 per cent, you should receive a nice pot of cash.’
