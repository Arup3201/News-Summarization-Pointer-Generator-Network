A military jury has found an Army sergeant not guilty of negligent homicide in the death of an Army private who killed himself in Afghanistan.

Sgt. Adam Holcomb was the first of eight soldiers 
to be court-martialed for the alleged racial hazing of Pvt. Danny Chen, 
who committed suicide last October.

The infantryman from New York City 
shot himself in a guard tower in southern Afghanistan after what after what investigators say were weeks of physical 
abuse, humiliation and racial slurs.

Death: Private Danny Chen, 19, of New York, was found dead in a guard tower at Combat Outpost Palace on October 3 after apparently committing suicide

Holcomb was
found guilty on Monday on two lesser charges of maltreatment of a 
subordinate and assault. He faces a maximum of two-and-a-half years in 
prison.

The 10-member jury deliberated for two hours in military court at Fort Bragg in eastern North Carolina on Monday after hearing closing arguments.

Throughout the trial, the defense 
painted Chen as an incompetent soldier disowned by his family. 
Prosecutors said Holcomb abused Chen and drove him to suicide.

A native New Yorker of Chinese descent, Chen had been in Afghanistan only two months when he shot himself in a
guardhouse at a remote outpost in Afghanistan's Kandahar province.

Mr Chen's relatives said he was 
brutally hazed during training because he was Chinese-American.

They said investigators told them that he was subjected to numerous 
racial slurs and forced to do excessive sit-ups, push-ups, runs and 
sprints carrying sandbags as punishment for not being as physically fit 
as the rest of the platoon.

On the day that he eventually ended 
his life, he had forgotten his helmet and his water when he went to 
report to the guardhouse.

His superiors forced him to crawl over 100 
meters of gravel with all of his equipment when he returned, all the 
while having other soldiers throw rocks at him.

State Senator Daniel Squadron, who 
represents the New York neighbourhood where Chen grew up, spoke about the
teen on the state Senate floor in February.

Squadron said.'The tragedy that 
befell him, the experience that he had serving our country, is one that 
no person in this country should ever have, period,'

'What those who hazed Danny Chen did 
is they disrespected every one of their brothers and sisters in the 
armed forces,' he added.
