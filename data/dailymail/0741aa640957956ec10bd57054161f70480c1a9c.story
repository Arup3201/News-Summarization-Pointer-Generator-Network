On Tuesday it will be one year since two pressure cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring scores of others.

As the anniversary draws close, survivors and families of those who lost their lives reflect on the past 12 months and talk of their hopes for the future.

Over the past year, a city shaken by an 
unthinkable act of terrorism has returned to its usual rhythms - sadder,
 but some say stronger, as well.

'I have to tell you, honestly, Boston is
 a better city now than it was before,' Thomas Menino, who was Mayor at the time, said.

'People learned how to 
deal with each other, they had to deal with a tragedy.'

Staying strong: Roseann Sdoia lost part of her leg in the bombing but has refused to let her injury stop her

Motivation: Roseann works out at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital as she focuses on being able to run again

Roseann Sdoia Roseann had been cheering on friends at the finish line when the bombs exploded on April 15.

The 42-year-old, who was standing close to where the second device detonated, lost part of her right leg and developed hearing trouble.

Despite her ordeal Miss Sdoia's optimism remained intact and she refused to give into her injuries, even if it meant navigating the staircases in her apartment building.

'Early on when all this happened, so many people were telling me to move out of the city and move out of my apartment because of the stairs and I don't have an elevator and parking is not very convenient,' she said. 'But I have been able to get past all of that.'

But the vice-president of a property management company said she still cries every day.

'What is sinking in is this is for life - that it is how I have to live, how I have to walk. What is sinking in is that life has changed,' she said.

Miss Sdoia is determined to get back to her hobby of running, and has hour-long workouts with a physical therapist twice a week.

Business as usual: Despite losing her leg, Roseann still drives and lives in her walk up apartment

New beginnnings: Roseann Sdoia with firefighter Mike Materia. The pair fell in love after he helped save her life

'Other than losing the bottom of my right leg, I'm still me ... I am still the same person I was before,' she said.

One other big change for Miss Sdoia was the unexpected romance that blossomed between her and firefighter Mike Materia, who held her hand all the way to hospital.

'He has been there through thick and thin, since day one. He has literally seen me at my worst,' she said.

'If I have a bad hair day, I ask him, "Am I having a bad hair day?" and he answers, "No, I've seen you have a worse one".'

She has yet to decide whether to go to the marathon this year but if she does she will have her family and friends at her side, as well as the three first-responders who saved her live - Shores Salter, a Northeastern University student used his belt as a tourniquet on her bleeding leg; Shana Cottone, a Boston cop; and Materia.

Inspired: Marc Fucarile, who lost a leg and has shrapnel in his heart, waves a Boston Strong flag with finacée Jen Regan at a hockey match

Ordeal: Marc's right leg had to be amputated and it is possible he will lose part of his left leg too

Marc Fucarile Everything has changed for 35-year-old former roofer, Mr Fucarile, who lost his right leg above the knee, has shrapnel in his heart and risks losing his left leg too.

But despite having to adapt to the appalling injuries he suffered at the finish line, the wave of generosity he has experienced since has inspired Mr Fucarile to help others.

'It's been mind-blowing. ... All these good people who stepped out, who helped us, helped so many of us,' he said.

'All the victims I know feel the same way. Complete strangers who give, when they don't have.'

The father of a six-year-old boy spent 45 days in hospital after the bombing and has been unable to return to work because of his injuries.

'Everything has changed. How I use the bathroom, how I shower, how I brush my teeth, how I get in and out of bed,' he said.

He added that his son, Gavin, is also struggling to adapt and understand why his father is limited in what he can now do.

'Gavin is like, "Hey, you want to go out 
and play?" and I'm like, "There's a foot of snow. I can't do snow. We're
 not going out and playing right now, sorry buddy". It breaks my heart.'

'Everything has changed': Marc says he and his six-year-old son are still struggling to adapt to his injuries

Change: Moved by the generosity of those around him, Marc now plans to be a motivational speaker

Mr Fucarile received $1.1 million from the One 
Fund to pay for his medical needs, and a fund has raised $184,000 for 
other needs but he still has huge out-of-pocket expenses caused by his injuries.

Inspired by the generosity shown to him however, Mr Fucarile is determined to get back to an active life, so he can help others.

He plans to become a 
motivational speaker and to set up a fund to help those who have 
suffered similar injuries, no matter the circumstances.

Loss: Police officer Sean Collier was shot dead by the bombers during the manhunt that followed the attack

Tribute: Collier's sister, Nicole Lynch, holds a plaque in his honor. The family have started a fund in his memory to help train police officers

Sean Collier Police Officer Collier was shot dead by one of the bombers during the manhunt that followed the attack.

For his family, including sister Nicole Lynch, the anniversary of the bombing will be hard but they plan to attend the marathon to cheer on a team running in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology officer.

Ms Lynch is still grieving for her brother, and said: 'Every now and then it kind of hits you again, like "Wow, this is real".'

In memory of her brother, the family have set up a scholarship fund that will pay for one student a year to be trained in law enforcement.

A group of 25 people, including two of Officer Collier's siblings, will enter the marathon this year under Team Collier Strong to raise funds for the scholarship - and Ms Lynch and her family will be there to support them. 

Grief: Nicole Lynch is still overwhelmed by the loss of her brother, Sean Collier

Ed Deveau The Massachusetts Police Chief is doing his best to make sure Boston stays strong. As he spoke to AP on the street where the brothers behind the attack exchanged gunfire with police, he refused to say their names.

'You'll get me to say, "older brother, younger brother" ... I think they get way too much attention,' he said. 'They tried to put fear in this city and they failed miserably.'

Police Chief Deveau will run the marathon next week with 11 other Watertown police officers. Nine of them have never run a marathon before.

William Evans The Boston Police Superintendent, who has run the marathon 18 times and finished just before the bombs went off last year, will be at the race again this year - but not as a runner.

The police commissioner will be superivising the extended security arrangements, which includes 3,500 officers which is more than twice the number last year, as well as bomb-sniffing dogs, extra cameras and safety restrictions on what runners and spectators can carry with them.

'It weighs heavy on my mind, that I want this to go off well. I don't want anyone hurt. I don't ever want a repeat of the tragedy we saw that day,' he said.

The past year has not been easy for Boston, which was gripped by fear by the terrorist attack that led to the city being locked down for the manhunt that followed the bombings.

But it has been able to move on. The impromptu tributes that filled Copley Square have been moved to a display in the Public Library, where every teddy bear of pair of sneakers act as a sign on unity.

The Red Sox, who wore Boston Strong patches through their epic ride to the championship last year  are playing ball again.

'The city really came together after the Red Sox won the World Series,' Mary Ellen Cahill, of Canton, said. 'It was such a moment of unity and togetherness ... We are unified, not terrified.'
