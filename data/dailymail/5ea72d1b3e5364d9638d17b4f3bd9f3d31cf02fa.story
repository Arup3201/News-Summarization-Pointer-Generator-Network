Secret Service agents in Bill Clinton's White House angered a black congressman in 1993 after forcing him to show his ID and searching his car before allowing him to attend a meeting with then-Vice President Al Gore.

A white driver taking Ohio Democratic Rep. Louis Stokes to his meeting was admitted without an ID-check.

A staffer's memo to Clinton a week later warned the president about the incident before a scheduled photo-op including Stokes and the mayor of a Cleveland suburb.

President Bill Clinton (R) leaned on Rep. Louis Stokes (L) to use his leverage with the Congressional Black Caucus during legislative fights. But in 1993 Stokes couldn't get in the White House without an ID check and a car search

Stokes (C, seated), was a civil rights icon in Ohio and served on the House Assassinations Committee that investigated the killing of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

The memo from a senior aide described Rep. Stokes' disgust at being subjected to what he thought was racial profiling

Stokes, a legend in the civil-rights history of Ohio's populous Cuyahoga County, was beside himself.

Rep. Stokes
 was asked for identification, although his white driver was not,' Susan Brophy, then White House deputy director of legislative affairs, wrote to Clinton.

'Furthermore, before Rep. Stokes was allowed in the gate, a K-9 detail 
searched his car. Rep. Stokes is understandably furious and believes the
 search to be racially motivated.'

Stokes, she wrote, had used his position as an appropriations subcommittee chairman to be 'very helpful to the Administration.'

'For your information, Howard Paster has spoken at length with David Watkins about the incident. David has taken steps to insure that in the future Members of Congress driving ,into the White House will be admitted expeditiously and will be treated with respect.'

Watkins, then White House director of administration, was fired a year later for using a presidential helicopter to ferry himself and friends to a Maryland golf outing.

Bill Clinton's political second act has been marred by revelations in his administration's archives, which were set for release a year ago but delayed by archivists. Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, went on to become a US senator and secretary of state -- and is now mulling her own White House run

Stokes (L) stood alongside Clinton in 1998 when he signed a law directing the National Park Service to spend $500,000 per year to connect sites along the old Underground Railroad, a secret system used by black slaves to escape the South in the years before the US Civil War

An earlier set of Clinton White House documents released on March 1 included a note to the president from aide Chris Jennings, who explained that Stokes was 'the key to the Congressional Black Caucus' if then-first lady Hillary Clinton's health care overhaul were to become law.

Image problem: Vice President Al Gore got so little public praise from President Clinton that his staffers started begging for it

'It's important that he hear from you,' Jennings wrote. 'I am convinced, though, that such "stroking" will pay dividends.'

Jennings recently left the White House after a second tour of service, where he was President Barack Obama's behind-the-scenes point man on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

The more than 7,500 pages released Friday sparked the fourth media feeding frenzy since the first batch went online on February 28.

The latest collection saw Vice President Al Gore's staff practically begging Clinton to say positive things about their boss in public toward the end of his administration.

'I am trying to knock down the idea that the Clinton White House’s support for Gore is based on legacy notions,' one Gore aide wrote his West Wing counterpart, 'and build up the idea that it is based on respect, relationships and in-the-foxhole camaraderie.'

'Also, some kind words about his very competent staff are always welcome.'

Gore's handlers, already looking ahead to a 2000 election race that the VP would lose, were desperate for a presidential hat-tip to 'Gore as one of the guys' – a wink of approval that 'rebuts the charge that Gore lacks a Clinton type of feel for political rhetoric.'

Meanwhile, the document cache sheds some light on how Mrs. Clinton, who now faces a possible presidential run of her own, was worrying White House aides because of a significant image problem.

First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton wound up 'getting real' in a different way after her husband's infidelities were exposed, but initially her handlers wanted the public to see a softer side of the future senator

While she came to Washington with sky-high favorability numbers, the undated memo remarks on how those metrics turned south.

'Obviously, this is partly the handiwork of the radical right and the radio talk show hosts who have much to gain by painting an unflattering portrait of you,' it reads.

'[S]ome Americans can’t handle smart, tough, independent women. And that’s the image most Americans have of you.'

While the first lady's close acquaintances know her as a warm and caring person with an everywoman streak, the memo advised, 'the public doesn’t know it' unless she engages in some publicity stunts to 'get real.'

The suggested solution was to showcase her in a series of public appearances carefully calibrated to make her seem more ordinary – including 'shopping frantically for Christmas presents, caroling (maybe with Chelsea and some of her friends) during the holiday season, working out, [or] making scrambled eggs for Sunday brunch.'
