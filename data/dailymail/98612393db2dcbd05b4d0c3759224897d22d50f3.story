A tiger at the Sacramento Zoo underwent successful surgery Tuesday to help ease its suffering due to urinary tract stones.

Castro the Sumatran tiger had a tube implanted that helps drain urine from this kidneys to his bladder.

The 15-year-old tiger is now recovering from the surgery and his keepers say he’s going to be A-OK.

Surgery: Castro, a 15-year-old Sumatran tiger from the Sacramento Zoo, undergoes surgery to correct problems he suffered from urinary tract stones

Father: Castro's species is critically endangered and he's personally helped the cause by siring several cubs. Zoo officials said he's recovering well from Tuesday's surgery

‘Castro did well today,’ veterinarian Ray Wack told the Sacramento Bee. ‘We are very happy with the way he handled the anesthesia and procedures and he’s up and recovering in his building.’

As one vital specimen of an endangered species, Castro has played a significant role in keeping Sumatran tigers, the smallest of the world’s six tigers, intact.

‘Castro is the oldest breeding male Sumatran in the country,’ Wack said.

Castro’s mate Bahagia produced a cub most recently on March 3.

A month before that, Castro got some bad news: he was diagnosed with lymphoma, a form of cancer.

‘Keepers noticed he was not eating as eagerly and had lost a little weight,’ said Wack. ‘The lymphoma was probably centered in his spleen.’

A fighter: Castro was diagnosed with lymphoma in February and his condition had been improving, aside from his urinary tract issues, since he began chemotherapy

While his condition has improved thanks to chemotherapy, his urinary tract issues became pressing when they threatened to block the tiger’s ability to urinate.

‘That would be an emergency,’ Wack said. ‘He would get really sick, really quick.’

Thirty specialists took part in the procedure and helped get the tiger-sized stent placed in Castro.

While the surgery would normally have cost around $10,000, Wack said the community pitched in and offset the costs. They ended up costing the zoo just $2,000.

But even if they’d had to pay the entire cost of the surgery, Wack said it would have been worth it.

Castro is one of about 200 Sumatran tigers in captivity worldwide and an estimated 500 remain in the wild.

‘Hopefully, that will fix that partial obstruction. We are trying to give him the best quality of life we can. He’s getting up there.’
