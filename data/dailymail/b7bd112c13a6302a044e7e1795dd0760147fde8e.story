These pictures may leave fans of the giant rubber duck spotted floating off Hong Kong feeling a little flat.

The 16.5-metre-high yellow duck, which has been bobbing merrily in Victoria Harbour for almost a fortnight, lay deflated on the surface of the water today.

But officials have assured admirers of the enormous inflatable artwork - named Spreading Joy Around the World - that the rubber duck is simply in need of 'freshening up'.

Dismay: Fans of the giant rubber duck in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour were dismayed to see it lying flat on the surface of the water

The duck, the work of Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, made its debut in Victoria Harbour on May 2 to cheers from the delighted crowd gathered at the dock.Â 

It was due to remain at the Ocean Terminal for a month, but was snapped lying on its side last night, a report in the South China Morning Post said.

Fans took to Twitter to express their dismay at the feared demise of the duck, and the Hong Kong Wrong blog joked that it had developed lung cancer as a result of pollution in the city.

But Harbour City in Hong Kong, which organised the exhibition, tweeted that the duck was simply enjoying 'sleepy time'.

'The Rubber Duck needs to freshen up,' it posted.

'Stay tuned for its return.'

The bright yellow duck has popped up in a host of locations across the globe, including Sydney, Osaka and Auckland.

It's next scheduled stop after Hong Kong is a closely guarded secret.

The floating sculpture is always deflated for transportation and then re-inflated in its new home using a generator.
