Yohan Cabaye ensured Zlatan Ibrahimovic was able to get one over on his old boss Roberto Mancini in the Qatar Winter Tour match between Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan.

The French midfielder calmly slotted home in the 57th minute to give PSG a deserved 1-0 victory at Le Grand Stade in Marrakech, Morocco, on Tuesday night.

Ibrahimovic and Mancini had warmly embraced before the game - smiling and laughing as they shook hands - but the Swedish striker seemed determined to secure a win over his former manager.

Having enjoyed success by winning Serie A titles under the stewardship of Mancini during the Italian's first reign at the San Siro, Ibrahimovic proved a thorn in his ex-mentor's side.

After a dour opening 25 minutes, the talismanic forward tested Samir Handanovic by sliding in to connect with a low cross - but the Slovenian stopper was equal to it.

That effort sprung Paris into life, and it was Adrien Rabiot who next sent an effort goalwards.

The midfielder's strike, from 20 yards, was once again parried by Handanovic, however.

And Inter themselves finally conjured a chance of note in the 43rd minute, when Zdravko Kuzmanovic slid a delicious ball through to release Mauro Icardi.

Icardi then tried to delicately chip Nicolas Douchez in the PSG goal, but he could only find the side netting.

That miss would prove costly as PSG came out far the better side after the break.

Ibrahimovic once again forced a magnificent save from Handanovic after a wonder-cross from the quietly impressive Blaise Matuidi.

But finally the deadlock was broken by Cabaye with 57 minutes on the clock.

Paris attacked with pace down the right through Rabiot, whose cross was deflected out to Cabaye.

The former Newcastle United midfielder then calmly slotted the ball into the bottom right-hand corner of the net from 15 yards after arriving in the box completely unmarked.

Despite late efforts from Andrea Palazzi, George Puscas and Nemanja Vidic, PSG comfortably held on for the victory.
