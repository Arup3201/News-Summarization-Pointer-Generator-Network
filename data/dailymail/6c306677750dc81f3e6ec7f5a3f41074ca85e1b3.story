A Louisiana man is lucky to be alive after driving his pickup truck into Lake Ponchartrain as he crossed the 24-mile-long bridge.

The accident occurred just after 3 p.m. on Saturday afternoon on the southbound side of the span when the driver was reaching for his cellphone, about 2 miles from the south shore, and lost control of the truck.

The vehicle hit a curb and rode a railing along the bridge for about 80 feet before tumbling over the side of the Causeway bridge.

Rescuer: A driver whose pickup truck went over the railing of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway was rescued by several other motorists who stopped on the bridge to come to his aid Saturday afternoon

Helping hand: The pickup driven by a 26-year-old River Ridge man plunged into the lake from the southbound span a couple miles from the south shore, authorities said. Rescuers on the bridge helped to pull both the driver and his rescuer to safety

The 26-year-old driver, a River Ridge man whose name was not immediately available, was able to escape the vehicle.

Incredibly, in an act of heroism, a passing motorist who had a life preserver jumped into the water and threw the vest over the driver.

Other drivers then managed to stop and assist ended up hoisting both men to safety after throwing them a rope.

David Grunfeld, a photographer for NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune was driving by at the time of the accident and witnessed a man being pulled out of the water.

'It was incredible,'' Grunfeld said of the scene and the calmness of the rescuers.

Grunfeld said he came upon the accident scene probably just minutes after it occurred.

He said a man in a white t-shirt jumped from the bridge into the water to help the motorist whose vehicle had gone over the side.

Tanner Brignac, 21, also witnessed the accident and saw the truck go flying over the side of the bridge.

'It was like a flash and then it was in the water. It all happened so fast, it was like half of a second,' Brignac recalled to the The Times-Picayune.

One man who was fully dressed in a suit, peeled off some of his clothes and jumped into the water.

'He just jumped in, like it was nothing.'

Photographer Grunfeld said the rescue was one of the most extraordinary things he's ever witnessed.

'A lot of people stopped to help,' Grunfeld said.

Long crossing: The pickup driven by a 26-year-old River Ridge man plunged into the lake from the southbound span a couple miles from the south shore

Long stretch: The four-lane, 5,189-pile concrete trestle bridge north of New Orleans is the world's longest bridge over water and was built in 1956

The driver of the vehicle pulled from the water did not appear to have life-threatening injuries. Nor did the man who jumped over the railing to help save him.

Several other people on the bridge helped to pull both men to safety using a rope to haul them using a rope.

The man who was driving the truck was taken to a hospital to be treated for minor cuts.

His rescuer was names as Alvin Pike, 45, who works in a New Orleans restaurant.

'It was pretty surreal, to tell you the truth,' Pike told Nola.com.

Mr Pike said he got out of his car, waved for traffic to stop and looked into the water to see the fallen driver floating near his sinking truck.

Despite not having any kind of rescue or lifeguard training, Mr Pike said, his instinct was to jump into the water after the driver.

'I didn't think,' he said. 'I just did it.'

The southbound bridge was closed for about 40 minutes during the rescue.

The four-lane, 5,189-pile concrete trestle bridge north of New Orleans is the world's longest bridge over water and was built in 1956.

It is something of a pulse-quickening half-hour drive in order to cross the span of which 40,000 cars cross each weekday.

In recent years, the southbound span has seen a handful of serious wrecks where vehicles have gone over the railing and into the lake below.

In the last week alone there have been four other accidents on the bridge which connects Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans with Mandeville on the northern shore.
