Much of President Obama's 2015 budget proposal won't get through the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, but the White House has unveiled it anyway – a liberal Democratic wish list of policies, many of which the GOP has already nixed or refused to take up.

The White House said Tuesday that the president's budget, all $3.901 trillion of it, would fully fund Obamacare, raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 per hour and index it to inflation, vastly expand infrastructure-repair plans that benefit labor unions, and significantly reduces the size of the U.S. standing army.

House Republicans will object to these and other measures, but the Democrat-controlled Senate has the first hearings on the budget, scheduled for Wednesday morning. White House Budget Office director Sylvia Mathews Burwell will testify.

The budget blueprint claims that $402 billion in savings related to the Affordable Care Act will offset new spending. That number is based on last year's budget, which called deep cuts to Medicare, trimming more than $300 billion from provider payments and another $50 billion from senior citizens.

Going it alone? Obama spoke about his FY2015 budget at a Washington, DC elementary school, looking isolated on a carpet decorated with cartoonish drawings of the alphabet

The opposition: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (L), House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (C) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R) will be waiting with knives out when Obama's ambitious budget hits Capitol Hill

But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office declared in February that the overall cost of the Obamacare law would eclipse $2 trillion over ten years, erasing much of that savings.

Obama presented his budget during a photo-op at a Washington, D.C. school, emphasizing education initiatives that were largely lost in the static about larger spending numbers.

Republicans are already complaining.

The budget proposal 'would hollow out our defense capabilities. And it would do nothing to preserve or strengthen our entitlements,' House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said in a statement. 

Obama's budget restores cuts in Social Security payments that he offered Republicans just a few months ago as an enticement to reaching the eventual budget deal in December.

'The president has just three years left in his administration, and yet he seems determined to do nothing about our fiscal challenges,' said Ryan. 'This budget isn’t a serious document; it’s a campaign brochure.'

'It would demand that families pay more so Washington can spend more,' he added.

But the details reveal a proposal that will cut the tax burdens of some families – with a $60 billion expansion of the poverty-fighting Earned Income Tax Credit, for instance – while hiking costs for the wealthy and big corporations that create jobs.

And the president wants to spend an additional $56 billion for new stimulus projects and $302 billion on infrastructure repairs over four years – pleasing labor unions, a major Democratic constituency.

Ryan and House Republicans are expected to release their own budget proposal in April, starting the inevitable back-and-forth sniping that will likely culminate in a fiscal showdown just before the November midterm elections.

Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP's vice presidential candidate in 2012, has emerged as the budget negotiator for Speaker John Boehner, but some tea party-aligned members of Congress fear that he will give too much away to the Democrat-controlled Senate

Republicans are 'counting on building the tension up to a breaking point,' a GOP election strategist in North Carolina told MailOnline on Tuesday. 'They're betting that jobs, the economy and Obamacare will look so bad by November that the Senate Democrats will do just about anything to save their own skins.' 

The GOP needs to capture just six seats in the U.S. Senate this year in order to retake the majority and control both houses of Congress. Vulnerable Democratic incumbents in at least five states have said they don't intend to campaign for re-election with President Obama by their side.

Obama's proposal, Rep. Ryan's office said, would add $8.3 trillion to the national debt in the long-term and raise $1.8 trillion in new tax revenue.

That includes the so-called 'Buffett Rule' tax which Obama has championed. That measure, according to the White House, would 'require that millionaires pay no less than 30 percent of income – after charitable contributions' in federal income taxes.

Another hit to the wealthiest Americans will come in the elimination of a specialized 'carried interest' provision in the federal tax code. That item allows private fund managers on Wall Street to cut their income tax rates for most of what they earn.

Americans for Prosperity, a tea party-backed conservative group, said Obama's budget proposal is 'not a serious attempt to solve our nation’s fiscal problems.'

Tim Phillips, the group's president, added that 'once again, President Obama has produced a budget that doesn’t balance, runs annual deficits, and relies on partisan politics, instead of a fiscally responsible, pro-growth tax policy.'

Wish list is likely dead-on-arrival in the GOP-controlled House of Representatives

@highlight

It would formalize a national minimum wage hike while enforcing the 'Buffett Rule' that sets minimum actual income tax levels for millionaires

Obama has eliminated cuts to Social Security that he promised as part of last year's budget negotiation

He also wants more than $300 billion in infrastructure improvements, helping labor unions in an election year
