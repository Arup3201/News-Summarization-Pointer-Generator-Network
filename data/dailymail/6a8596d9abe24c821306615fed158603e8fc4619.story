With a car boot full of fizzy drinks, crisps and sweets, it is hardly surprising that he is popular with pupils.

But parents and teachers are furious at the mobile trader who has set up shop at the gates of their school.

They accuse him of shamelessly cashing in on their children’s appetite for junk food – and in one of the worst areas for childhood obesity in the country.  

Cashing in: The unnamed trader has converted his Suzuki Wagon R into a fully-stocked sweet shop. He parks the customised vehicle outside Ellis Guilford School in Nottingham every morning

Using his people carrier as a 
makeshift shop complete with signs and a till, the trader was selling 
500ml bottles of fizzy drinks for 50p and bags of crisps for 30p – 
around half the price  of shops.

But his days of dubious enterprise could be numbered.

The
 local council is considering outlawing him from the vicinity of the 
school after receiving complaints from parents. Ellis Guilford School in
 Nottingham, catering for 1,350 children aged 11 to 16, is in an area 
where a staggering 40 per cent of teenagers are overweight.

Parent 
Richard Glaves, 40, said: ‘You see in the news about children getting 
fat because of chocolate, crisps, that sort of thing, and this man is 
ruthlessly exploiting that.

Sour taste: Teachers say the man is exploiting teenagers in an area where 40% are obese

‘It’s
 disgusting the way he is deliberately targeting children when he knows 
their parents will not be looking. To me, it’s no different than a drug 
dealer peddling drugs to addicts. He must see overweight pupils and 
think he’s quids in.’

Schools in the area have also reportedly had problems with vans selling chips, burgers and kebabs.

Parent and school governor Henrietta Robinson said yesterday: ‘I don’t want my children exposed to these traders.

‘My
 children say there are often mega-queues, often snaking out on to the 
road, and they know some students have to run off the road because 
traffic is coming.

‘My 
children also say they have heard that some students are often late to 
classes, as the trader will always stay until the last student is 
there.’

Headteacher Sally 
Coulton, said: ‘We have an issue with a tuck shop van parking outside of
 the school gates at the start and end of the day.  I have had numerous 
conversations with the owner of the van about the issues that he is 
causing.’

Nottingham City Council has now said it will ban the man from operating outside the school gates.

Councillor
 Alex Norris said: ‘It is worrying the easy access that schoolchildren 
have to junk food outside the school gates, and that they are 
potentially spending their dinner money on fizzy drinks and chocolate 
bars instead of, or on top of, a balanced school meal.

Cheap: The man sells 500ml bottles of fizzy drinks for 50p and bags of crisps for 30p, half the price they can be bought for in shops. The prices attract hundreds of pupils every morning

Crowds gather: Parents say their children form 'mega queues' beside the vehicle, which often snake into the street. There are calls for the man to be banned from selling sweets anywhere near the school

‘It’s
 up to all of us, including schools and parents, to make sure 
schoolchildren are making better choices about what food and drink they 
choose.’

The trader refused to comment.

The
 scenario carries echoes of one at Rawmarsh Comprehensive School near 
Rotherham, where mothers delivered fast food to children in defiance of 
Jamie Oliver’s 2005 healthy school meals campaign.
