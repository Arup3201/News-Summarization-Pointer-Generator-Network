From eating acidic foods to choosing certain sexual positions, couples desperate for a baby girl will turn to any old wives’ tale for help.

But now, one man claims he has developed an app which can help couples conceive the daughter they desire.

Alain Hanash, a software developer, says his app draws on dietary science to increase a woman’s chance of having a baby girl.

Software developer Alain Hanash has created an app - called StorkDiet/Girl - which he says can increase a woman's chance of conceiving a girl. He says it gives advice based on dietary science

He says the app ‘is a natural, safe and scientific method to assist would-be mothers in choosing their baby's gender’.

The StorkDiet/Girl app, which costs £6.99, is based on new research from the University of Oxford and the University of Exeter, Medical Daily reports.

The study by experts at the universities revealed that there is a link between a mother-to-be’s diet and the gender of her baby.

It showed that women who eat less salt and more calcium, as well as fewer calories in total, are more likely to have a girl.

The researchers looked at 740 women and discovered that about 56 per cent of those who followed a low-salt and high-calcium diet had a baby girl.

Based on this, Mr Hanash’s app encourages women who want to conceive a girl to eat a diet rich in foods that will improve their chances – specifically those that are low-calorie and low in salt and high in calcium.

Mr Hanash, who is from Washington, says that if women follow the advice given by the app they can have an 81 per cent chance of conceiving a baby girl

This diet is based on a database of some 8,400 products which is stored on the app.

The app also helps women work out which time of the month they should have sex to give themselves the best chance of conceiving a girl.

According to Mr Hanash, who is from Washington, women who stick to the diet and advice on timing sex have an 81 per cent chance of conceiving a girl.

The app is available on both iPhones and Android.
