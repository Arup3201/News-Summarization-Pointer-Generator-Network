Staying put: Goalkeeper Julian Speroni has signed a new 12 month deal with Crystal Palace

'I’m delighted,' Speroni told Palace's official website. 'This is my home. This is where I always wanted to be, so I'm really pleased.

'I've been saying for months and months this was always my first choice. I'm really please we can forget about what happened, deal with it and look forward to next season now.

'The expectation will grow as long as we stay in the Premier League, but we are going to do our best, of course, try to stay in the league again and finish as high as we can.'

The news will come as a huge a relief to the South London club who had been fearful of Speroni leaving the club this summer.

Speroni was named the club’s player of the year last season after a string of brilliant displays to help Palace maintain their top-flight status.

Sunderland and Leicester had been interested in taking the experienced shot-stopper ahead of next season.

Manager Tony Pulis had been interested in Norwich keeper John Ruddy as a potential replacement for Speroni.
