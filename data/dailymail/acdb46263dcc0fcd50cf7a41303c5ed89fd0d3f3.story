Gateshead are a win away from a return to the Football League after a 54-year absence as they prepare to face Cambridge United in the Skrill Premier play-off final at Wembley a week tomorrow.

Gateshead official Jeff Bowron explains why the FA Commission’s proposed changes make their remarkable comeback story even more unlikely...

I felt sick when I heard about the proposals. Totally deflated. It’s very, very worrying for a club like Gateshead and I really hope this is not allowed to happen.

Plan B? FA chairman Greg Dyke has proposed to restructure lower leagues by introducing Premier League B teams

English football is all about the 92 League clubs, as well as the 15 or so professional clubs in the Conference. And yet this feels like the Premier League is just wagging its tail again.

It’s all right for the Premier League and Championship because these new B sides won’t be allowed promotion above League One but it’s a different story for the rest of us.

We have waited 54 years to get back into the Football League. Now it feels so near they want to dilute and weaken the achievement. Just our luck.

They’re talking about B teams but what they mean is reserve teams.

Say we do go up and we get the chance to play away at a club like Portsmouth, FA Cup winners not so long ago. That would be a massive game for Gateshead. But under these proposed new rules we could be forced to play West Bromwich Albion reserves instead. What’s that about?

And how competitive are these B teams going to be? Surely Everton B aren’t going to care about getting three points in the same way as Gateshead would if we went to Plymouth or AFC Wimbledon in League Two, for example.

And who is going to watch them? Clubs 
like ours are supported by people in the area; people for whom Gateshead
 really means something. There’s history and tradition there.

Where will they even stage their games? They’ll probably have to borrow non-league grounds.

You’re just weakening the league from all different angles.

I can understand why they want to change things but these proposals are not the right way to go about it. The Football League needs to be strong on this one. It’s a worrying time for a club like ours.
