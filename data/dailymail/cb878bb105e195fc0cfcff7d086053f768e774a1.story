They are two A-listers who are never afraid of baring their flesh. But how do Madonna and Kate Hudson maintain their youthful glow and firm smooth skin?

The singer and actress may be two decades apart in age but they share the same cellulite-busting secret.

And while they could both more than afford to splurge on lavish beauty treatments, their secret beauty weapon only sets them back £8.99.

Little secret: Kate Hudson and Madonna both use Dr Organic Royal Jelly Cellulite Cream to firm up their skin

Madonna, 54, and 33-year-old Kate both swear by Dr.Organic’s Organic Royal Jelly Cellulite Cream.

Since Cleopatra’s reign, Royal Jelly, the exclusive food of the queen honey bee, has been prized for its power to offer ‘eternal youth’, and it is certainly working its magic on the stars, both of whom boast toned and smooth skin.

The rich massage cream aims to improve the texture and tone of the skin.

Made from a heady blend of ingredients including certified 100 per cent organic Royal Jelly, aloe vera, shea, cocoa butter and honey, it claims to boost circulation and increase nutrition and oxygen supply to connective tissue.

This is supposed to help fight the dreaded ‘orange peel’ effect, and reduce bottom and thigh volume.

Royal Jelly is prized for its combination of essential amino and fatty acids, trace minerals, skin boosting B vitamins and natural antibacterial quality nourishes and judging by the results, it's easy to see why both Madonna and Kate are fans.
