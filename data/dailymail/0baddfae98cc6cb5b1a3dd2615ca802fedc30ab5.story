Buddha statues have been banned in Iran, along with Barbie dolls

Buddha statues have joined Barbie dolls and characters from The Simpsons as banned items in Iran.

Authorities are confiscating Buddha statues from shops in the capital Tehran to stop the promotion of the religion in the country, according to newspaper reports.

Iran has long fought against items, such as Barbie toys, to defuse Western influence, but this appears to be the first time that Iranian authorities are showing an opposition to symbols from the East.

The Arman newspaper quoted Saeed Jaberi Ansari, an official for the protection of Iran’s cultural heritage, as calling the Buddha statues symbols of 'cultural invasion.'

He said authorities will not permit a specific belief to be promoted through such items. Ansari did not say how many Buddhas had been seized, but that the 'cleansing' would continue. 

Some Iranians buy Buddha’s statues to decorate their homes and cars. Most are made in China and come from Iranian free-trade zones in the Persian Gulf.

'As I understand, none of customers cared about Buddhism, they only bought it for decoration,' said Reza Sanaei, a shopkeeper who sells the statues.

A customer, Marjan Arbabi, said she 
personally did not like the statues. 'But my parents have set of five 
Buddha’s statues at their home simply because they think the statues are
beautiful,' she said.

Under the constitution, Christian and Jewish beliefs as well as Zoroastrianism are recognized beside Islam, the official religion of the country. The law, however, says that, in general, the rights of all non-Muslims should be observed.

Some Islamists do not support production of any statue, since they view it as a way to promote idols.

In 2010, several statues depicted prominent Iranians, disappeared from Tehran city’s streets and squares. Their disappearance was blamed on an unnamed group with a strict interpretation of Islam that bans the depiction of the human form in art.
