Disgust: Ira Isaacs, 61, has been sentenced to four years in prison after being convicted on felony obscenity charges in Los Angeles

An adult film producer has been sentenced to four years in prison after selling fetish porn featuring bestiality and human excrement.

Ira Isaacs, 61, was jailed on Wednesday after being convicted on five counts of felony obscenity by a jury last April in Los Angeles.

The jury took two hours to reach its decision on April 27, 2012.

During the trial, jurors were forced to watch hours of videos in which females engaged in sex acts involving human waste and animals.

Other evidence at trial showed that Isaacs had made obscene videos where he directed women to perform sexual acts involving human waste.

Isaacs claimed that the extreme pornography, 
which he had bought from other people and sold through his business L.A. 
Media since 1999, was 'shock' art.

The jail time ends a long-running legal 
saga that saw two mistrials, including one in which sexually explicit 
material was found on a personal website of the chief justice of the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, who was overseeing the case.

Isaacs was indicted as part of an 
effort by a Bush administration task force to crack down on smut in the 
United States. The unit has since been disbanded.

Isaacs's case is believed to be the last case of its kind in federal court.

Isaacs' 2008 trial was halted after 
Alex Kozinski, chief judge of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, had 
sexually explicit material on a personal website.

Among the questionable images was 
video of a man cavorting with a farm animal and a picture of nude women 
painted to look like cows.

Kozinski recused himself and was admonished by a special committee of his colleagues for actions they deemed as poor judgment.

At issue at the trial was whether the videos sold by Isaacs were obscene. The test hinged on a 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that held that a work is not legally obscene if it has 'literary, artistic, political or scientific value'.

Jurors also were asked to decide whether the videos, some of which depicted fetishes involving feces, violated standards of what is acceptable to the community at large. In all three trials, jurors had to watch a series of explicit videos in entirety.

In addition to prison time, Isaacs will be supervised for three years following his release and must pay a $10,000 fine.
