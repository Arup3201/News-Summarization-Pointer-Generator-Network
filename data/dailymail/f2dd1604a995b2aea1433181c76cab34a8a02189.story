A French woman working for an international organisation in Yemen has been kidnapped, France's foreign ministry announced.

The 30-year-old and her local guide were abducted by unidentified gunmen on Tuesday morning as they traveled to work by taxi in the capital Sanaa.

'We unfortunately confirm the kidnapping this morning, in Sanaa, of a French national working for an international organisation,' the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

'We are fully mobilised to try and locate her and ensure a speedy liberation.'

President Francois Hollande, who spoke at a news conference, revealed she worked for the World Bank and called for her safe return.

It comes as Paris is on alert for a new terror attack after 'at least' five drones were spotted illegally flying around city landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, Bastille Square and the U.S. embassy building.

'She was kidnapped in front of a ministry in Yemen,' he said.

'We ask for her to be released as soon as possible, we are trying to locate her and will do all we can for her to be freed.'

Yemen has descended into chaos since Shiite Huthi militia swept into Sanaa from their mountainous northern stronghold last year.

The Huthis overran the capital in September and installed a 'presidential council' earlier this month after President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi and Prime Minister Khalid Bahah tendered their resignations.

Since then, France has joined countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United States, Egypt and Germany in closing its embassy in Sanaa. 

In recent years tribesmen have often taken foreigners hostage to press the government to provide them with services or to free jailed relatives.

The country is also home to one of the most active branches of al Qaeda, which has also targeted foreigners.

In France, unmanned aircraft were also spotted flying overnight near the French capital's Place de la Concorde and the Invalides military museum, where Napoleon Bonaparte is buried.

Tourist hotspot: The first drone sighting in the French capital was around midnight. Shortly after an unmanned aircraft was seen flying near the Place de la Concorde

French security sources were unable to catch the operators of the drones, which are typically fitted with video recording equipment and can be used for surveillance of a terror target to assess security levels and any spikes in pedestrian football ahead of a planned attack.

The emergence of drones comes amid warnings by terrorist groups that they will attack the city, following January shootings which left a total of 20 dead, including three terrorists.
