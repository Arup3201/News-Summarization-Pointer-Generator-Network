An Alabama jail has a history of medical negligence so serious that at least three seriously ill inmates have died while incarcerated at the facility, claims a series of lawsuits filed in recent weeks.

The suits claim officials at Madison County Jail withheld medical treatment from inmates despite obvious signs that each was critically ill. What's more, the suits allege officials did it just to save a buck.

'They wait and wait and wait and hope it goes away. That's a formula for killing people,' civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod told CNN.

Died of gangrene: Deundrez Woods died in Madison County jail in Alabama in 2013 after authorities let a foot infection get so out of hand it killed him, claims a shocking lawsuit

Indifferent medical staff? Nikki Listau died after alcohol withdraw caused her to fall off a bunk an break bones including a femur and was left unattended by medical staff, the suit claims

Sherrod is representing the families of three inmates who died while at Madison County jail's medical-watch area instead of in a hospital receiving medical treatment, where the suit claims they should have been.

Sherrod's most shocking claims surround the youngest of the deceased, 19-year-old Deundrez Woods.

Woods was booked in June 2013 on shoplifting and assault charges. For weeks, court filings say, the teen seemed fine.

But then an infection on his foot became so extreme that it began to have a stench. At first, all the care he received was a hose down from the guards.

Not until 'Woods was confused, hallucinating and unable to communicate with correction and medical personnel,' was he taken to the medical unit of the jail, the lawsuit reads.

He died of a blood clot from his gangrenous foot 15 days later, reports CNN. During that time, the suit alleges he was left naked and alone in a cell with no water where he didn't eat.

'They just watched him,' Sherrod said. 'They were happy to let him lie there ... totally indifferent to what was really going on.' 

Rather save a buck? Three lawsuits claim that Madison County Jail in Alabama would rather save a few dollars than pay for critically ill inmates' medical treatment

Sherrod claims the same was true months before for 60-year-old Nikki Listau and two months later for Tanisha Jefferson, 30.

Listau was booked on harassment charges in March 2010. Her ensuing alcohol withdrawal was so bad that she had a seizure that caused her to fall off her bunk during the night in a medical watch cell, the suit claims.

Never saw a hospital: Tanisha Jefferson complained repeatedly of severe abdominal pain that ended up being a fatal bowel obstruction, the suit sasys

She broke a femur and several ribs during the fall, says the suit, Her court hearing was canceled,, but she was not taken to a hospital.

Two hours later the suit says Listau was found unconscious and she died the following day. 

Jefferson's death came on October 31, 2013 following an arrest for harassment. She first complained of severe abdominal pain and constipation on October 19.

Her only medical treatment was a prescription for laxatives before her death, her lawsuit states, despite repeated pleas to jail staff that she feared for her life.

'If I die, it's on y'all,'  the mother of three allegedly told jailers. The suit says that's precisely what happened due to lack of proper medical treatment when she died of a major bowel obstruction .

'What connects them all is that all of these people were in the medical-watch area, supposedly under the care of nurses,' said Sherrod. 

County attorney Jeff Rich says all three cases are being vigorously defended. The county has declined to comment further on the pending litigation.

The suits seek compensatory and punitive damages and legal fees for the families of the three deceased.
