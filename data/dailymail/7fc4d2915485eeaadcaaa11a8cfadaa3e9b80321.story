Compensation paid to injured and aggrieved teachers has doubled to £40million in four years.

The huge total handed out last year included awards made to sacked teachers with weak cases as schools and councils struck deals to avoid costs escalating.

Successful personal injury claims include awards of thousands of pounds for stepping into potholes, slipping in wet corridors and tripping on uneven paving slabs.

The biggest payout – £500,000 – was made to a teacher who hurt her back when the lift she was in at work suddenly plummeted.

Figures released by classroom unions this week showed that the NASUWT alone helped its members to £20.7million in 2013 – up 30 per cent in a year – while the Association of Teachers and Lecturers won £5.3million.

The National Union of Teachers, which is similar in size to the NASUWT, does not compile total payouts, but the amount secured by all three main teaching unions is thought to exceed £40million.Unions won about £20million for their members in 2009.

Most of the compensation was paid out following employment disputes, where teachers claimed they had been wrongly dismissed, discriminated against or otherwise ill-treated by bosses.

Much of it came through compromise agreements, which are legal deals that avoid costly tribunals. The agreements prevent employees from pursuing future claims but critics fear they make the likelihood of a payout greater.

The figures also raised questions over ‘rewards for failure’. One teacher who was fired for gross misconduct over allegations linked to pupils’ GCSE coursework won £3,000 even though the National Union of Teachers, which represented him, admitted he did not have a strong case. In another case, a deputy head was fired for poor management of special needs provision after Ofsted failed her school. Her claim was settled a day into a tribunal hearing for £16,000.

Dia Chakravarty, political director at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Money which could otherwise have been spent on more teachers and classroom equipment is being wasted on compensation claims.

‘Authorities must do more to ensure taxpayers are not exposed to this endless stream of hefty payouts, particularly at a time when the Department for Education is having to make necessary savings.’

Most personal injury claims related to slips, trips and falls.

The £500,000 payout last year was made to a 33-year-old college lecturer from the East Midlands who suffered a back injury when her lift dropped from the mezzanine floor to reception.

The figures also provided evidence of devastating injuries inflicted by pupils. An NASUWT member from the South East won compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority worth £91,784 after being punched in the mouth by a teenager.

The 59-year-old suffered a broken root on a tooth and developed post-traumatic stress disorder. The NASUWT admitted that in total the cases cost taxpayers millions.

General secretary Chris Keates said: ‘The tragedy is that in most cases compensation would be unnecessary if employers followed good employment practices and followed health and safety procedures.

‘Instead teachers have their careers, lives and health blighted and millions of pounds of public money has to be spent. Employers flout the law, but it’s the teachers and taxpayers who pay the price.’

She claimed more cases would arise due to moves to deregulate employment laws and health and safety provisions.

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers said the vast majority of its payouts were linked to members being made redundant rather than leaving due to poor performance.
