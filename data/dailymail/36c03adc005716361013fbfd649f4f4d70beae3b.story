A grandmother was horrified to find a worm in the supermarket ready meal she was sharing with her grandchildren.

Kathy Thompson had already began eating the chicken tikka slice she had bought from her local branch of Iceland when she made the disgusting discovery.

Her grandchildren were about to bite in to the meal, but she stopped them just in time.

Disgusting: This worm was found in a chicken tikka slice ready meal sold by a branch of supermarket Iceland

Ms Thompson, from Barnstaple in Devon, said she was up all night imagining the worm crawling around inside her.

'I was chewing when I spotted this worm on my plate and I just spat out my food everywhere,' she said.

'I had cut the slices up and was sharing them with my young grandchildren and immediately snatched them away. It was just disgusting.'

She added: 'I spent the night retching and it was like I could feel it crawling in my stomach whenever I thought about it.'

Ms Thompson has vowed never again to shop at Iceland, which specialises in frozen food and is the 10th largest supermarket group in Britain.

'I have another packet of the slices in my freezer but I don't want to even touch them now - they'll have to go out,' she said.

'It is just so disgusting - this should have never been allowed to get in the food.'

Investigation: Iceland has vowed to look in to the contamination after receiving a complaint from Ms Thompson

A spokesman for Iceland said that the company had launched an investigation into the incident after receiving a complaint from the angry customer.

He said: 'We can confirm that Ms Thompson has been in touch with our customer care department regarding the foreign body found in her chicken lattice.

'Ms Thompson is returning the item to the store and the foreign body will be collected by our supplier in order for them to carry out a thorough investigation.

'As soon as we have the results of the investigation we will get back in touch with Ms Thompson.'
