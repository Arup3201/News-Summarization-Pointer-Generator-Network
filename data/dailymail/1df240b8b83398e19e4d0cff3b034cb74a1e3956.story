A British woman killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul wrote a tragic last message on Twitter just weeks before she died, asking: ‘I am back in Afghanistan and wonder what lies before me this time.’

Jeni Ayris, from Edinburgh, died alongside 11 fellow aviation workers when a female insurgent rammed a car laden with explosives into their minibus as they drove to the airport on Tuesday.

Islamist group Hezb-e-Islami claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming it was in retaliation for the controversial American film allegedly lampooning the Prophet Mohammad which has sparked turmoil across the Muslim world.

Bubbly: Jeni Ayris, who had been in Afghanistan for more than a month, was due to return home to see family and friends in Edinburgh only this weekend

Shocking attack: Ms Ayris, 47, died alongside 11 of her fellow aviation workers when a female suicide bomber rammed into their minibus

Ms Ayris, 47, who had been in 
Afghanistan for little more than a month, was due to return home to see 
her sister Patricia and friends in Scotland only this weekend.

Heartbroken
 friends described her today as a 'great cook who loved entertaining' 
and a passionate sailor who enjoyed boating on the Firth of Forth and 
along the West Coast of Scotland.

She had been working in the country for just over a year as a customer
 relations manager for aviation firm Air Charter Solutions/BalmOral, organising 
private flights for charities and NGOs into and out of the country.

'She loved her job,' said friend Richard Kellett, a restaurant manager and former Army captain in the Scots Guards.

Grief: Ms Ayris was described as 'warm' and 'wonderful' by her distraught friends and family

'She would go out there for three months at a time and come home for one. She was due to come home this weekend.

‘She loved it out there and always looked forward to going back when she came home on leave.’

He said Ms Ayris, who was born in South Africa but had lived in Scotland for 20 years and gained British nationality, had no immediate family apart from sister Patricia, who he said was ‘distraught’ over her death.

Ms Ayris and a partner opened a cafe called Ndebele in Edinburgh several years ago, serving South African food.

‘Patricia got a call from the company only this morning telling her her sister had been killed in a roadside bomb. It wasn’t until later that she found out it was a suicide blast.

‘Patricia is distraught. Jeni was her only family and she cannot come to terms with the violent manner in which her sister was killed.

‘She was a wonderful woman and a wonderful friend.

'She loved sailing and spent time sailing in the Firth of Forth and on the West Coast of Scotland.

'She was a great cook and loved entertaining, dinners and parties at her house were always great fun.

'She was an amazing friend who could always be relied upon to help you out of any situation no matter how difficult it might be. She always had a great positive energy and a buzz about her.'

Michael Hodgson, 39, who is from the Netherlands and is a close friend of Ms Ayris, set up a Facebook page in tribute to her.

'Jeni Ayris was a warm, kind and generous person with an everyday objective of helping everyone she met,' he said.

'She had a positive boundless energy which rubbed off on everyone, making her loss all the more hurtful.

'Jeni leaves behind a sister who is her only family as well as a huge number of friends across Scotland and the world who are all absolutely devastated by her tragic death.

'Although born in South Africa, Jeni was a British citizen and her home was firmly rooted in Edinburgh where she had lived for the last 17 years.

'She loved living in the UK and was very passionate about her life in Scotland.

'For 10 years she was a popular figure in Tollcross where she ran the Ndebele South African Cafe and Delicatessen.

'Jeni was highly respected and valued
 in her job as a manager in the aviation sector where she was 
responsible for the safe air travel of NGOs (non-governmental 
organisations) throughout Afghanistan, and her contribution was her 
practical way of helping Afghanistan move forward.

'At this moment her sister and close friends ask everyone to respect the privacy of the family and their loss.'

Mr Hodgson met Ms Ayris when she first moved to Edinburgh, where they both worked as silver service waiters.

Horrific sight: Bodies were seen lying by the mangled mini-van, which was thrown at least 50 metres

He said they 'just clicked' as friends and described her as his 'night and day' and 'like a sister'.

A spokesman for the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office said: 'We can confirm that one of those killed in 
the attack was a dual South African and British national.

'Our deepest sympathies are with the families of all those involved.'

He said the office was liaising with the Afghan government and providing consular assistance.

The firm Ms Ayris worked for, ACS/BalmOral, said today: BalmOral
Central Contracts can now confirm that all the people that were killed in the
Afghanistan suicide bomb blast on Tuesday the 18th September 2012
have been identified.

'We have
been in contact with each of the families and relatives and will be keeping
them all up to date with the necessary arrangements to bring their remains back
to South Africa.

'BalmOral
Central Contracts wish to convey our sincere condolences to all involved and
affected by this random tragic event. We thank the South African aviation
community for their concern and assistance during these very difficult times.'

The bomber was named by Afghan insurgents as Fatima, 22, who was reportedly wearing a suicide vest and blew herself up on a large avenue northwest of the city centre near the airport.

The criminal director for the Kabul 
police department, Mohammad Zahir, said eight South Africans believed to be foreign
aviation company workers died in the 
blast and ten Afghan bystanders were wounded.

The other person killed was believed to be Afghan - possibly a driver or translator for the group.

The explosion, which went off in front of a petrol station, was so powerful it hurled the minibus about 50 metres (46 yards).

Reports from the scene said at least six
 bodies lay next to the destroyed mini-van.

Eight Afghan workers were also said to have been injured in the blast.

An eyewitness at the scene said he was waiting for a bus to go to work at 6.45am when he saw a small white sedan ram into the mini-bus.

'The explosion was so powerful and loud that I could not hear anything for ten minutes,' said Abdullah Shah, a teacher waiting at a bus stop. 'It was early and there wasn't much traffic.'

The bombing came a day after hundreds of Afghans burned cars and threw rocks at a U.S. military base in the capital in a demonstration against the anti-Islam film.

One police vehicle was burned by the mob before they finally dispersed around midday yesterday.

Hizb-i-Islami is led by former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The group has recently sought to participate in a so-far fruitless peace and reconciliation effort led by President Hamid Karzai.

As part of the group's effort, it offered a peace plan that called for a broad-based government. Hizb-i-Islami is a radical Islamist militia that has thousands of fighters and followers across the north and east of Afghanistan.

Its 65-year-old leader is a former Afghan prime minister and one-time U.S. ally who is now listed as a terrorist by Washington.

Devastating: The incident was the first reported suicide car bombing ever to be carried out by a woman in Afghanistan

The Taliban have also threatened to increase their attacks against foreign targets to avenge the controversial film.

Taliban fighters last week attacked a large British base in southern Afghanistan, killed two U.S. Marines and destroyed six fighter jets. Nato forces killed 14 insurgents and captured another who participated in the attack.

In a torrent of violence blamed on the 
film last week, the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans 
were killed in an attack in Benghazi.

U.S. and other foreign 
embassies were stormed in cities in Asia, Africa and the Middle East by 
furious Muslims. At least nine other people were killed.

Shocking violence: The bomber was driving a Sedan and blew it up beside a minivan carrying foreigners on a major highway leading to Kabul's international airport

Widespread anger: Afghan police arrive at the scene of the attack, which was apparently launched in retaliation for a film mocking the Prophet Mohammad

The news will raise fears that anger 
over the film will feed into deteriorating security as the U.S. and other 
Western countries try to protect their forces from a rash of so-called 
insider attacks by Afghan colleagues.

The U.S. has sent ships, extra troops and special forces to protect U.S. interests and citizens in the Middle East, while a number of its embassies have evacuated staff and are on high alert for trouble.

Despite Obama's efforts early in his tenure to improve relations with the Arab and Muslim world, the violence adds to a host of problems including the continued US military involvement in Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme, the Syrian civil war and the fall-out from the Arab Spring revolts.
