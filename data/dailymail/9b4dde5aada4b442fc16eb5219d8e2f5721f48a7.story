This is the moment a nine-year-old girl speaks with her mother for the first time in 15 months.

Nirere, who lives at the Mugunga refugee camp near Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, was driven away from her family due to war.

In emotional video footage, the girl speaks with her family members via the phone - beaming as she is connected to her mother.

When asked after the call whether she was happy, the little girl smiles and says 'yes'.

The girl was separated from her mother 15 months ago due to war in the Democratic Republic of Congo

Nirere is one of thousands of Congolese people who could reconnect thanks to Humanitarian Jean-Marie Minani who helps run the Mugunga camp - home to around 8,000 families.

Mr Minani manages four free calling booths at the Camp as part of the Instant Network programme - supported by the Vodafone Foundation.

Another camp member Mama Furaha spoke to her brothers for the first time in two years after they were separated two years ago.

Both of the woman's parents were killed during the war and she was separated from her family shortly afterwards.

The woman smiles as she speaks with her surprised family - who at first do not seem to recognise her voice.

She then beams as the conversation continues - adding 'I am happy' to the cameras.Â 

Those living at the Mugunga camp are able to make five minutes of free calls a week.

The scheme started in the camp in October 2013 and since then 2,000 calls a week have been made.

The initiative has provided around 17,000 displaced people in the camp with access to free mobile calls.

Jean-Marie Minani said: 'Many of the families in the camp have been unable to contact family members left behind in their home villages.

'It is amazing to be able to put a smile on the faces of some of these people and provide them with an emotional lifeline. For me, this is not just a job, it is a vocation.'

Oisin Walton, Instant Network Programme Manager at the Vodafone Foundation, said: 'Jean-Marie is passionate about connecting families who have been displaced as a result of the conflict in the Congo.

'For the first time, the refugees in the camp have access to free calls to reconnect and stay in touch with their relatives.

'This is one example of how a simple mobile phone call has the power to reunite families and transform people's lives.'

The Second Congo War began in August 1998 - just a year after year the First Congo War. A ceasefire deal was signed in 2003, but many are still suffering from its affects.
