Yaya Toure has suggested he may be about to step away from international football, after claiming 'my target is done'.

Toure captained his country to this winter's Africa Cup of Nations, their first major trophy in over two decades, and could now follow his brother Kolo in retiring from Ivory coast duty.

Toure said he would take a couple of days to decide, but suggested that the Elephants' new generation should be allowed to flourish.

Toure was in action during the draw with Equatorial Guinea in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, on Sunday 

'My future?' he asked, when questioned by the BBC. 'You have to wait. Now, my target is done. We have to wait for a couple of days and see what we can do.

'My brother has retired, and Copa (Barry, the long-standing Ivorian goalkeeper) as well. The time of the youngsters will come soon. We need to let them.

'It's always beautiful when everything is going in the right way. I'm delighted with the trophy of 2015. Now we just want to focus, I will wait a couple of days before we decide my future.'

The comments will be good news for Manchseter City, who struggled in Toure's absence during the Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea.

The news would be good for Manchester City, who have struggled in Toure's absence

City won just once, drawing twice and losing twice, during their midfielder's time away, exiting the FA Cup and losing ground on Chelsea in the Premier League title race in the process.

But with the next World Cup more than three years away, Toure, 31, doesn't see the tournament as a realistic prospect, so is considering his future with the national team.

'I've done what I have to do and for me that's it,' he added. 'To see an African team win a World Cup we have to wait a couple of years again.'
