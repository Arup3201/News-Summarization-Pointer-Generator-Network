Sporting Lisbon teenager Ryan Gauld has won his first international call-up to Gordon Strachan's Scotland squad.

The 18-year-old, dubbed 'Mini-Messi', is the only Scot still remaining in this season's Champions League after being named in Sporting's squad to face Chelsea on Tuesday.

The former Dundee United starlet has seen his football career fast-tracked this term and gets his first senior call-up after starring for the Under 21 side.

Gauld scored twice to help Billy Stark’s side end their European Championship campaign on a high with a 3-0 win in Luxembourg.

The youngster signed a six-year contract with the Portuguese giants in the summer, which includes an eye catching buy-out clause of £47.8million.

Gauld is one of two players, along with Stevie May, to be lined up for a debut when Scotland play European Championship qualifiers against Georgia and Poland.

Aberdeen defender Mark Reynolds is among just three Scottish-based players in the pool alongside Celtic pair Craig Gordon and Scott Brown.

Defenders: Christophe Berra (Ipswich Town), Craig Forsyth (Derby County), Gordon Greer (Brighton and Hove Albion), Grant Hanley (Blackburn Rovers), Alan Hutton (Aston Villa), Russell Martin (Norwich City), Mark Reynolds (Aberdeen), Andrew Robertson (Hull City), Steven Whittaker (Norwich City)
