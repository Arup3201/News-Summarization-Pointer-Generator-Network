It may have just been the perfect weekend for John Terry following his side's 2-1 victory over Liverpool on Saturday. 

The Chelsea skipper topped it all off with some added sprinkles as he took a trip to an ice cream parlour with a difference whilst holidaying in Dubai.

Posting a video on his official Instagram page on Monday evening, the former England captain showed us he still has the reflexes as he played catch with ice cream scoops with one of the parlour's employees.

As England prepare to take on Slovenia on Saturday, Terry used the time off during the international break to spend some quality time with the family.

The 33-year-old was clearly enjoying himself whilst flinging frozen goods in the United Arab Emirates' most populous city. 

Chelsea currently sit four points clear at top of the Premier League table and will look to resume their fine form after the international break.  

Terry's performance against Liverpool proved he is still one of the best defenders in the Premier League
