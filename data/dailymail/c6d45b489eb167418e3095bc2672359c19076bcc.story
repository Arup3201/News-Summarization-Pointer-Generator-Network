Everton's golden oldies were reunited successfully in the Europa League on Thursday and now Sylvain Distin and Phil Jagielka aim to show age is no barrier in the Premier League, either.

Injury to Antolin Alcaraz meant 36-year-old Distin was recalled to partner Jagielka — four years his junior — against Lille.

The 3-0 win showed the understanding between the veterans is as good as ever and they hope to stifle Sunderland on Sunday.

Sylvain Distin returned to the Everton line-up for the Europa League game against Lille on Thursday night

An injury to Antolin Alcaraz has seen Jagielka and Distin resume their successful partnership at the back

‘It is always nice to play alongside Sylvain,’ said Jagielka. ‘He’s proved against Lille that he’s a fantastic player. 

'The whole back four, or five if you count Tim [Howard], have all been together for over five years now.

‘Syl is amazing. It seems he gets younger each year. You forget how old he is but fair play, he works really hard on and off the pitch.

At the age of 36 Distin is out to prove he still has plenty to offer Roberto Martinez's side

Jagielka says it is fantastic to be playing alongside his long-term centre back partner again

‘He’s a fantastic professional and a great role model for kids.’

Meanwhile, Sunderland’s Jordi Gomez believes Everton boss Roberto Martinez has a future at one of Europe’s very top clubs.

He said: ‘With all due respect to Everton he has everything to become one of the top managers in the world. He can go higher.’
