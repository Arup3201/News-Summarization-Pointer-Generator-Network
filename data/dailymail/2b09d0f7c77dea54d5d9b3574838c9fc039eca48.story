Earlier this month there was a frisson of excitement as we waited to see whether James Ward might become another one of those rare things: a British man cracking the world’s top 100.

On social media, calculations were published about whether he might make the treasured double digits after a late run in some Challengers around the globe, only for Euston’s finest to marginally fall short of the magic mark.

Other countries might have found something vaguely comic about this, Wimbledon’s host nation getting worked up about having a second man gaining direct entry into the Grand Slams. The scarcity value of a British man gaining such elevated status is, ultimately, a sign of just how bad things have been in recent decades.

James Ward had a great year, in which he nearly infiltrated the top 100 of the men's single rankings

This is not, incidentally, to belittle Ward’s impressive rise this year. He is an admirable professional who deserves everything that comes his way, and pound-for-pound his Davis Cup victory over Sam Querrey would win my vote as the performance of the season from a British man or woman.

The progress to the Davis Cup quarter finals, when only an inspired Fabio Fognini prevented Leon Smith’s team from making the last four (why couldn’t he have proved as useless as he was towards the end of the season?), was a highlight of the year.

The team competition was also a metaphor for the way a season of promise rather fell away into one of familiar disappointment. In the case of Elena Baltacha it was one of real human tragedy, putting the footling business of elite tennis into perspective.

Ward has been an admirable professional, who deserves everything who comes his way

In the trivial pursuit of producing top tennis players the ledger shows that Great Britain did make some progress in the men’s game while sliding backwards on the female side.

If we use the top 300 as a benchmark, the number of men inside it has gone up from four to eight, with four inside the top 200 as opposed to three a year ago. On the women’s side there are only three inside the top 300, a desperate figure, down from seven twelve months previously.

I will not dwell too much on Andy Murray here, as his exploits are well-documented by the albeit dwindling number of writers who try to cover the sport in a serious fashion. Only he really knows if the changes to his entourage are a good thing or not, but regardless he will surely remain embedded in the top ten, and probably rejoin the top five.

The performance of the season goes to James Ward (right), who beat Sam Querry in the Davis Cup

He remains the gold standard, although with the way he is playing at the moment it is difficult to see him beating either Novak Djokovic, or a fully fit Rafael Nadal, in a Grand Slam again. Yet he has shown before that he has the answers.

On the wider canvas of British tennis there are cautious grounds for optimism that Lawn Tennis Association Chief Executive Michael Downey and his imported Director of Player Development Bob Brett may be moving things in the right direction.

The strategy of trying to build the sport from the bottom up and helping the grass roots flourish has to be the right one, and what is emerging is that the changes to the performance side of things are more radical than had previously been thought.

The money-no-object approach is clearly going out of the window, with large cuts expected in the numbers of High Performance Centres, player funding, personnel support and talent identification schemes. Look out for the bountiful award of wildcards to be cut as well.

It is part of a policy they are calling ‘customised decentralisation’. This is the kind of jargon you often hear organisations come up with when they have lots of other people’s money to spend, which is the case with the LTA.

But whatever it means, if it fosters a greater sense of self-reliance, resourcefulness and ambition among current professionals and aspiring ones then it must be the right thing to do, as those are indispensable qualities required to make the big time.

The tragic death of Elena Baltacha in May put tennis into perspective this year

Brett’s biggest attributes are likely to be his improvement of other coaches and the simple setting of standards that should be adhered to. Apparently he is already showing the value of demanding drills, combined with an insistence on discipline.

For example little things like the practice of players taking a breather courtside at the National Tennis Centre and checking their mobile phones in the middle of a session is outlawed when he is around. Why it has taken until late 2014 for this to be forbidden you can only wonder.

You also hear that many employees are anxious and uncertain about what is going on, with areas such as the staff physio situation said to be a mess.

Yet as one coach told me, the effect of the wider changes may be to sort out who really wants to be a player and who does not.

The apparent retirements this year of Oliver Golding and George Morgan, two young players who had shown such promise, demonstrate the truism that creating a healthy production line is a numbers game.

They were part of a generation in who great hope was invested due to junior results, whose other members include Liam Broady and Kyle Edmund. The older ones are barely into their twenties and already the ranks of serious prospective top 150 players are diminishing.

The idea – as one sees in successful tennis countries – is that you get a large enough volume of players with the technical quality, athleticism, attitude and ambition to drive themselves towards the top.

Then when you get dropouts, as will inevitably happen for all sorts of reasons, you will still be left with a decent sprinkling of survivors. Whichever way you look at it, you have to get sufficient numbers of those with some genuine potential coming in at the bottom of the pyramid.

Broady was a heartening story, finally getting back on track after looking like he was going to fall into that gaping black hole between juniors and the professional ranks. While still having much to do, the Stockport lefthander was testament to the benefits of spending a prolonged spell on the road and getting on a roll through playing a large volume of matches.

Laura Robson has struggled through the year with a wrist injury - the worst of all tennis problems

Edmund would probably have hoped to end the year higher but finished on a positive note at the Yokohama Challanger in Japan that saw him enter the world’s top 200.

His progress seemed to be arrested by uncertainty over his coaching when Greg Rusedski was brought in. Rusedski’s work ethic and credentials are not in doubt, but there was always going to be a problem with his commitment, given his other interests.

The reasons for his appointment seemed tied up with political expediency at the governing body, and the experiment was brought to an end in October, not to the great surprise of shrewder observers.

Robson was in action in Australia in January, but has missed a lot of 2014 through injury

But this kind of thing is an almost inevitable consequence when you have a large, centralised system with lots of staff to handle, as we have seen before. One was also left questioning, not for the first time, whether showering a promising young British player with wildcards was, in the long run, a sensible way forward.

Edmund has the drive and talent to push on again in 2015, although it seems likely that he and Broady are facing a tough generation of international contemporaries.

Heather Watson enjoyed a strong comeback and was, by some distance, the standout GB female performer. Wins over the likes of Dominika Cibulkova and Flavia Penetta showed what she is capable of, but her form tailed off from mid-August onwards, just when it looked she could make a run towards the top 30.

Heather Watson had a mightily impressive year, rising from 121 back into the top 50 of women's tennis

Her rise back from 121 to the top 50 was the more impressive for not having any competition from Laura Robson, who was badly missed through that worst of tennis injuries, to the wrist.

It has cost her a year of her career at least, but the optimistic view is that it could yet be the making of her - that is if the time away has sharpened her appetite.

She could certainly look at what Eugenie Bouchard has achieved in the intervening time and believe she is able to exceed that, as she is more than her equal in physical talent alone. Hopefully Laura will be back at the start of the season as she is already in training in Florida – but we should not expect too much too soon.

Wins over the likes of Dominika Cibulkova and Flavia Penetta showed what Watson is capable of

Naomi Broady did well but Jo Konta failed to make any headway, somewhat surprisingly. After that one has to sift through a very long list of players before coming to Katy Dunne and then the chronically underachieving Tara Moore, who is destined to join the swollen ranks of British could-have-beens.

Perhaps the most encouraging news was the return from retirement of Naomi Cavaday, who swiftly enjoyed wins at a lower level and, at 25, still has the time to fulfil her potential.

There are not, it must be said, too many younger British players setting the world alight, although you hear encouraging things about the long term potential of a few, especially in the 12 to 15 bracket.

Of course we have heard it all before, the focus on the younger age group, so it is necessary to fend off the inevitable degree of scepticism. But at least the focus now appears to be on preparing players for the professional ranks, and not looking too much at the window dressing of junior performances.

The LTA will pay as much attention to the forthcoming participation figures as it will the state of the elite rankings. They will be particularly interesting in light of the huge drop in recreational cricket numbers revealed last week.

At the bottom and at the top there are grounds for thinking there may be an improvement next year although, as ever, seeing will be believing.
