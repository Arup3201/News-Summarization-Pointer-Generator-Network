Two schoolboys were forced to fight and perform sex acts on each other by a teenager, pictured is a black male wanted in connection with the incident

Two schoolboys were forced to shoplift, fight and perform sex acts on each other by a teenager who made them get off a bus by claiming to have a knife, police said.

The two boys, aged under 16, were approached by an unidentified male teenager on the top deck of a bus departing from  Brixton, London, just before 8pm yesterday.

He forced the pair off the route 133 bus in Elephant and Castle after claiming he had a knife and led them to a park in Newington Butts, where he made them steal from a nearby shop and fight each other.

The pair where then taken to the stairwell of a block of flats in Walworth, where police said he forced one of the boys to perform a sex act on another before walking away in an unknown direction. 

Scotland Yard has  released a CCTV image of a black teenager wanted in connection with the incident. He was seen wearing a dark blue or black Nike hoodie.

Trainee Detective Constable Amy Beautridge said: 'This was a most unusual crime and distressing crime, during which the two young victims were terrified by threats made by the suspect, who intimated he was in possession of a knife.

'He used their fear to control them and force them to effectively do as he said.'

She added: 'Despite their young age, the victims have been incredibly brave in coming forward and providing information to the police and I would praise them for this.' 

'I am very keen to identify and speak to the person in the CCTV image we have released today, and I would urge anyone who recognises him to call the police or Crimestoppers as soon as possible.

'I would also like to reassure anyone concerned about contacting the police that they will be treated with the utmost sensitivity.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 020 8721 4621, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.
