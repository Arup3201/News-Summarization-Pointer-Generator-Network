Heritage: Cox's Orange Pippin, pictured growing on the tree, has been named the most popular fruit tree for home gardening

There might not be many traditional English apples to be found in your supermarket any more – but you’ll certainly find them cropping up in gardens.

Record sales of ‘heritage’ fruit trees have been reported this year - with one of the country’s finest apples, Cox’s Orange Pippin, the most popular.

The figures suggest there is still a great appetite for fruit varieties native to Britain, despite claims that supermarkets tend to rely on more consistent varieties from abroad.

The latest sales figures from Homebase have revealed a 30 per cent increase in sales of fruit trees this year.

According to the retailer, the number one choice was Cox’s Orange Pippin - widely regarded as the finest eating apple in the world.

Worcester Pearmain - a small, classic English apple renowned for its strawberry-like flavour - came in second place.

It was closely followed in third by Laxton’s Superb, the definitive late-Victorian dessert apple.

Homebase has further predicted demand for vegetable seeds to increase by 20 per cent this year.

The retailer has claimed record numbers of gardeners are growing their own heritage fruit in order to show their ‘anger at supermarkets who refuse to stock UK sourced traditional fruit and veg’.

But fruit expert Adrian Barlow said a number of English varieties just weren’t commercially viable. He added that supermarkets had in fact been very supportive of the UK apple industry in recent years.

Mr Barlow, who is the chief executive of English Apples and Pears Ltd, said: ‘A number of varieties can’t be grown commercially because the yields are insufficient in order to provide the grower with a profit.

He used Laxton’s Superb as an example, explaining that supermarkets didn’t stock them because they didn’t keep well and had a greasy skin.

Mr Barlow 
said: ‘Supermarkets have actually increased their stocking of English 
apples hugely over the past seven or eight years. In fact, they are 
selling as much as the industry can produce.

‘During the 1990s, it’s true to say supermarkets focused on imports, but that has changed completely.

The rise in sales also suggests that people are searching for ways to save on their grocery shopping. A separate report by Homebase, which surveyed the shopping habits of over 61,000 people across the UK, found that 26 per cent of homeowners now owned a vegetable plot.

A spokesman for the store said: ’An entire generation is rediscovering the delicate flavours of fruit and vegetables eaten straight from the garden.

‘These are the subtle taste and textures which our grandparents would have taken for granted - and gardeners are also saving hundreds of pounds in the process.’
