Baseball star Andruw Jones was arrested for allegedly battering his wife, to whom he drunkenly yelled 'I want to kill you' before dragging her down stairs during a heated domestic dispute.

A police report released on Wednesday said Jones, 35, who played with the New York Yankees last season, became intoxicated after a Christmas Eve party at the couple's home.

His wife, Nicole Derick Jones, told cops that her husband 
had consumed several alcoholic beverages after the guests had left, and 
she asked him to help put together a computer desk in the garage.

Fight: Police say they were called to Andruw Jones' home in a wealthy suburb of Atlanta and found him fighting with his wife of ten years, Nicole Derick Jones

But as he worked on the desk, he became more and more belligerent, according to the police report, and they got into an argument that became 'pretty heated.'

She said that Jones grabbed her arm, and dragged her across the floor of the garage until she slipped out of his grip and went back into the house.

But Jones quickly followed and allegedly grabbed her ankle as she climbed up some stairs in the house, dragging her back down.

According to his wife, he put his hands around her neck and said: 'I want to kill you, I want to f***ing kill you.'

Mrs Jones eventually fled to her parent's home, where she called police, who responded to the home and found Jones asleep in the master bedroom.

They said that he appeared dazed and visibly intoxicated.

Cops said in their report that Nicole Jones suffered visible injuries on her neck as a result of the altercation.

He was booked into Gwinnet County Jail at about 3:45am, and released about seven hours later on $2,400 bail.

The couple has a son and daughter together.

Big league star: Jones played for the Atlanta Braves from 1996 until 2007, where he won ten consecutive Golden Glove awards for his skill as an outfielder. He played last season with the New York Yankees

Once a premier player in the big 
leagues, Jones broke into the majors with the Atlanta Braves in 1996 and
 won 10 consecutive Gold Gloves from 1998-07 as their center fielder.

He has 434 career home runs over 17 seasons in the majors.

Mostly recently, he played for the New York Yankees last season in 2012 and was released as a free agent.

Jones signed a $3.5 million, one-year contract with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles of Japan's Pacific League earlier this month.

In 2001, he testified in the prostitution case against an Atlanta strip club owner. While Jones was never charged, he said that he was invited to the Gold Club and that he was propositioned for sex by two strippers.

He testified under oath that he had sex with both the women in front of the club's owner and six other men.
