Petrol prices should be slashed by 7p a litre by Christmas to keep pace with plummeting oil prices, the RAC says today.

The 'overdue cut' would bring pump prices down to 114p a litre and deliver some added festive cheer, it said.

The RAC's own monitoring of fuel prices shows there is 'scope for the price of a litre of petrol to come down by more than 7p a litre'.

Diesel should drop by nearly 6p, it added: 'This would bring the average price of a litre of petrol to 114p and diesel to 120p – prices last seen across the country in March 2010. '

The RAC said: 'We are urgently calling on fuel retailers to pass on further savings in the wholesale price brought about by the continued fall in world oil prices. 

'This overdue cut would reduce the biggest cost of motoring just in time for Christmas.

Currently, the average price of petrol stands at 120.84p, with diesel at 125.43p. At the start of the year petrol was 130.79p a litre and diesel was 138.24p.

The motoring organisation said that in June this year a barrel of crude reached a 2014 high of $115.36 – and the highest price since September last year .

But since then it has fallen dramatically and as of Thursday stood at $68.59 – a fall of $46.77 or nearly 60 per cent.

The RAC said: 'While the falling oil price has been reflected at the pumps by retailers consistently reducing forecourt prices, the latest savings in the wholesale price need to be passed on quickly to demonstrate transparency. '

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'The tumbling oil price, coupled with a pound that is still strong against the dollar, have led to a phenomenon that many motorists are pretty unfamiliar with – falling pump prices.'

He said the forecast 7p a litre reduction that retailers should be passing on 'is the biggest the RAC has seen in recent years.'

Petrol began to come down from its record high of 142.48p a litre on 17 April 2012. Diesel hit its record high of 147.93p on 13 April 2012).

Supermarkets such as Asda and Tesco have been driving with price cuts, prompting retailers nearby to follow suit.

Mr Williams said: 'Retailers now have a very reasonable record on transparent pricing so we have no reason to believe that they will not pass on the savings in the wholesale price. 

'We just urge them to do it sooner rather than later to make the point very clearly to motorists that they operate a fair pricing system. 'If they do, we could well see petrol pump prices fall by well over 7p a litre in the next few weeks and diesel by almost 6p a litre.

'With this kind of drop in the national average prices, motorists will no doubt see some very low petrol prices – perhaps under 110p a litre from retailers who pride themselves on having the lowest prices.'

The RAC said that with petrol at 114p a litre motorists would be saving over £9 filling up an average 55-litre family car compared to the beginning of the year, with the cost falling from £71.93 down to £62.70.

Diesel at 120p a litre would save drivers £10 per fill-up – down from £76.03 to £66.

Mr Williams said: 'This will be very welcome news just in time for Christmas when household budgets are really stretched. It should also be another boost for business as it will lower operating costs substantially. '

But he warned: 'While motorists are enjoying much lower forecourt prices it's important to recognise that they will always be limited by fuel duty, which represents nearly 58p in every litre, and VAT which is charged on top, at around 20p a litre.'

He said a driver filling up a 55-litre petrol car at 114p a litre would pay £62.70 of which £31.87p would be duty, £10.45 VAT and only £20.38 for the fuel itself.

In the Autumn Statement Chancellor George Osborne also said he was freezing fuel duty 'to help hardworking people be more financially secure.'

Motorway filling stations – accused by motoring groups and ministers of 'ripping off' drivers with sky high prices - will soon have to post their charges in advance on roadside poles so motorists can decide whether to drive on by for a cheaper deal elsewhere, the Government announced this week taking a leaf from the France where this is law.

Transport Minister Robert Goodwill said: 'For too long drivers have been ripped off by petrol prices on motorways.'

Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander warned recently : 'When the price of oil falls, the public have a right to expect pump prices to fall like a stone, not a feather.'

He was acting on long-standing complaints of motoring groups that pump prices rise 'like a rocket' when oil costs go up, but fall 'like a feather' when they come down.
