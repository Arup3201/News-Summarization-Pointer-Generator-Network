A giant barrel jellyfish weighing up to 20kg has been spotted swimming in a Cornish estuary - but swimmers will be relieved to hear it's completely harmless.

Cornwall Wildlife Trust officer Matt Slater was having a swim with his dog Mango when he had a close encounter with the creature in the Percuil estuary near St Mawes, Cornwall, catching it on film.

It is one of several barrel jellies which have been spotted with increasing frequency inland as the creatures swam in warm summer waters.

Like a horror film: The jellyfish may look intimidating, but thankfully they are completely harmless

Like a basking shark, barrel jellies feed exclusively on plankton which is caught with sticky mucus-covered tentacles.

They are also totally harmless to humans as their stings are too weak to get through human skin.

Mr Slater said: 'It was an otherworldly experience. These creatures are incredibly beautiful when you get a close look at them.

'The tentacles really look like soft coral, and round the edge of the jellyfish's umbrella like bell there is a deep blue line punctuated every 20cm or so with a tiny dot, a sensory statocyst.

'Jellies are more aware of the watery world around them than you may imagine.

They look like something from a horror film, but barrel jellyfish are the 'basking shark' of their species - enormous but harmless, feeding only on miniscule prey.

Often they are spotted from boats in the deeper waters of the English Channel, the Irish Sea and off the Outer Hebrides.

But it is rare for them to swim closer to the coast or inland, which is why recent sightings have made headlines.

And when the seas warm up in summer and autumn they breed at a phenomenal rate, creating huge swarms.

Beneath the dustbin lid-shaped bell are hundreds of tiny mouths ('pores'), each surrounded by tiny stinging tentacles to catch plankton.

The stings, however, are not strong enough to harm humans.

'They are constantly swimming up and down in the water column looking for profitable patches of plankton.

'The statocysts are their sensory cells that enable them to orientate and tell up from down.'

The Marine Conservation Society said it had received reports of jellyfish being spotted across the south coast and west coast of England, as well as parts of Scotland because of the warmer weather.

There have also been sightings of turtles in the south-west of England and the Wales coast.

Mr Slater added: 'Lots of people have been calling Cornwall Wildlife Trust to ask us why there are so many jellies this year.

'In the spring tiny anemone like jellyfish 'polyps' living on the sea bed expand in size and then bud off thousands of tiny larvae.

'Most years these larvae will perish but in years where the conditions are good, temperatures are optimal, there is plenty of planktonic food and predators do not eat them all, large numbers of them will survive creating these huge jellyfish swarms.

'It is a boom and bust cycle. In fact according to our records the last time such large numbers of barrel jellyfish were seen in Cornwall was in 2002.'
