It beat 'twerking' to be crowned word of the year by editors of the Oxford English Dictionary and it seems that the power of the selfie shows no sign of abating thanks to image conscious Brits.

A new study has revealed that Britons are now so obsessed with taking the perfect 'selfie' that more than one in ten take over ten minutes to prepare themselves for the shot, taking as many as seven before they post the final snap.

Somewhat defeating the object of a selfie, a staggering 81 per cent admitted they'd prefer a friend to take it for them before posting it online as their own perfect shot.

How many times did you take that, Rosie? Miss Huntington-Whiteley looks picture perfect in her selfie, but did she, like one in six Brits, take seven attempts before settling on this one?

Almost two in ten Brits (17 per cent) would even encourage their selfie wingman to upload it onto social networking sites for them – believing it makes them seem less vain.

Hoping to strike the perfect pose, the study, which asked 1,500 people to reveal their selfie habits, found that over two thirds (69 per cent) touch-up their make-up and re-style their hair before a selfie, with one in ten (12 per cent) of those being men.

One in five (19 per cent) admitted to changing outfits ‘pre selfie’ to ensure they attain the ultimate selfie ‘look’.

The report showed that Brits take selfies to make friends envious, with almost a quarter (24 per cent) posting selfies to social networks to show off, and one in five (21 per cent) being most likely to snap a selfie whilst away on holiday.

The penchant for a picture-perfect holiday selfie was favoured more by men than women, with a quarter of males (25 per cent) more likely to take a selfie on holiday than any other location.

Stylish Alexa Chung was named the best celeb selfie artist by Brits in the World Duty Free study; topping both men and women’s list of celebs who made them feel envious with their snapper skills.

However, celebrities who made Brits shudder with their shameful selfies were wild child Miley Cyrus, and selfie addict Kim Kardashian – who started the latest craze for the belfie shot – and were both named in the list of top three celebs who made Brits cringe.

Professor Cary Cooper at Lancaster University said the rise of the selfie was a sign Britons were becoming more self-absorbed.

'Selfies are a modern day form of communication but one of the motives for doing this is because people are showing off, they have only taken the picture because they are in impressive surroundings.'
