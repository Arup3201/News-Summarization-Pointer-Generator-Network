An elementary school principal shot himself dead as police drove to search his home a week after he was seen in his office with a fifth-grade girl with the lights switched off.

Deputies were heading towards Lance Clement's rural home in Hanford, California at 7.30am on Friday to serve him with a search warrant when they heard a gun shot inside, Lt. John Golden said.

When authorities reached his front door, Clement's wife met them and told them that her 42-year-old husband, with whom she has children, had just shot himself dead.

The Orange Center Elementary principal had led the school for four years - but he'd been under investigation for a week after a school employee saw him in his office with the young girl, police said.

Suicide: Lance Clement, 42, shot himself dead as police arrived at his California home last week to serve him with a search warrant. A week earlier, he had been seen in his office with a child with the lights off

The employee called the sheriff's office the next day.

Sheriff Margaret Mims told the Fresno Bee that investigators had spoken with Clement and the child and had determined that nothing inappropriate had happened.

But authorities remained concerned after interviews more than 20 students at the school revealed Clement had often summoned young girls to his office, most often from the fifth grade.

The interviews produced evidence of one case that may have led her office to seek charges of sexual battery or lewd acts with a minor, Mims said.

They also revealed that Clement had given several of the girls gifts.

'Definitely, unethical behavior took place,' the sheriff said.

Following the interviews, authorities obtained a search warrant for Clement's home after they found the hard drive missing from his school computer, Mims said.

They plan to continue the investigation with computer they found in the search and, despite Clement's death, they believe 'parents need to know'.

She added that an investigation could also establish if any child needs counseling, she said.

School trustees took Clement's keys and placed him on administrative leave with pay on Wednesday, which was the last day of school, said staff with the Fresno County Office of Education.

Former Orange Center school board member Gene Balthrop said the allegations and suicide left him 'in complete shock', adding that the board has never received any complaints about Clement.

Orange Center Elementary serves about 350 students from pre-kindergarten to grade 8 and is located a little less than a mile outside the Fresno city limits.

Before he became principal there four years ago, Clement spent three years as principal of Parkview Middle School in Kings County.

Before that, he was a part-time bus driver, janitor and basketball coach at other schools.

Gus Amos, a board member of Armona School District, for which Clement previously worked, said he was 'very well-liked'.

'He
 dazzled us with his knowledge, with his demeanor,' Amos said. 'He was 
great with kids. I don't think anyone didn't like Lance.'

The school board will vote to name an interim principal next week.
