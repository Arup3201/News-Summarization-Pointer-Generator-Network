Latoya Smith, 10, was wearing earphones when she was hit by a lorry as she tried to cross the road on her way to school

A ten-year-old girl, who was killed by a lorry as she tried to cross the road on her way to school, was wearing earphones, an inquest was told today.

Latoya Smith was changing buses because there was so much traffic on the road when she was struck by a lorry in Peckham.

She died of her injuries in January, 2010.

An inquest into her death heard today that the schoolgirl attempted to cross the road near a junction where temporary traffic lights had been installed.

The usual pedestrian crossing had been closed, and a sign was also put up that said 'No Crossing Here'.

Witnesses told the jury inquest at Southwark Coroners' Court that she had one earphone in her ear after she was hit and the other was lying on the ground.

Abisamad Abdulle said the little girl was hit when she was almost half way across the road.

He said: 'The lorry ran over her leg and back. I don’t think he saw her because he didn’t stop for a while.

'When I got to her, she was on the ground, her hood was up and I saw one earphone in her ear and the other on the ground,' reported News Shopper.

Latoya, from Penge, south east London, was on her way to the Camelot Primary School in Peckham.

She was taken to King’s College Hospital in Denmark Hill after she was knocked down at the corner of East Dulwich Road and Peckham Rye, but died of her injuries.

Her mother Grace Johnson said her daughter was a talented athlete and wanted to be a teacher when she was older.

Ms Johnson had walked Latoya to the bus stop but was told hours later her daughter had been in an accident.

She told the hearing that Latoya had good road sense and that she had previously told her not to change buses.

Ms Johnson added that Latoya, who was weeks away from her eleventh birthday when she died, was a 'caring girl' who volunteered in fundraisers, according to The Evening Standard.

Christine Milton, who worked at Latoya's school, told the inquest the schoolgirl may have been worried about being late for class.

She said Latoya often liked to help out in the mornings and did not like being late.

Another witness, Christine Waldron, who was driving behind the lorry said Latoya 'came out of nowhere'.

News Shopper quoted her as saying: 'After the accident I banged on the lorry window and the driver said to me, "I think I just killed a little girl" but I said I thought she was still alive because she was moving.

'I’m sorry but she was not at the crossing.'

The inquest is due to last for five days and will continue tomorrow.
