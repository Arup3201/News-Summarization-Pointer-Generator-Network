A brave little boy had his wish come true today when he met his heroes Spider-man and Batman.

Jakub Wrona, from Leeds, who is battling juvenile arthritis, was amazed to meet the superheroes at a specially arranged charity event.

The characters arrived in style, in a Lamborghini Batmobile, to meet the seven-year-old at the London Designer Outlet, Wembley.

Rays of Sunshine Children's Charity made Jakub's dream come true and even laid on a superhero storyline.

To Jakub's surprise, Batman and Spider-man's arch enemies, Venom and the Penguin, tried to spoil the day.

But following a spectacular car chase, with the help of police, the 'baddies' were stopped in their tracks and taken away in the back of a 'cop car'.

Spider-man aka Peter Parker was on-hand to make sure that Jakub's day was special

Jane Sharpe, the CEO of Rays of Sunshine, said: 'This was an incredibly special wish for Jakub.

'The entire community of Brent and Wembley came together to make sure it was as spectacular as it could have been.

'This year we hope to grant 800 wishes for seriously ill children, like Jakub, and we work hard to make sure each and every one is as special and unique as the child themselves.'
