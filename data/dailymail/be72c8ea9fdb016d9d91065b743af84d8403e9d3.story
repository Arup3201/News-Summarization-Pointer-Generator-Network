Taken towards the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th, these shocking black and white photographs tell a tragic story.

Millions of American bison, also known as American buffalo, were reduced to mountainous piles of bleached white bones and drying hides following a slaughter on an unprecedented scale carried out by European settlers.

At the time, of course, the perpetrators of the hunts that led to the buffalo's near extinction held a very different point of view to that of most people today.

Decimated: Buffalo were nearly wiped out by white hunters as they moved into the American west. Pictured, the carcasses of dead buffalo lying in the snow following a hunt

Macabre: A pile of bison and antlered deer skulls sit bleaching in the sun in Albany County, Wyoming, 1870. Skulls were often kept as trophies or for decoration by hunters

Slaughtered: Men in the mid-1870s pose with a mountain of buffalo skulls soon to be ground into fertilizer, the sad remains of an animal that once ruled the American plains

At their peak the bison are believed to have been the biggest 
population of large wild mammals anywhere on Earth, numbering an 
estimated 50 million before the European settlers arrived.

Yet within 
the space of a few decades, their number would be reduced to a mere 
2,000, bringing to an end an era in American history.

Far from inciting feelings of disgust or
horror, the slaughter of bison was seen by European settlers as a means
to wealth, a healthy pastime, and most chilling of all, as a way to end
the primary source of sustenance for the Plains Indians and so drive 
them from their land.

Perhaps the most shocking fact about the near extinction of the American bison is that it appears to have been wholly intentional, part of a high-level strategy.

Many scholars believe the government and military actively promoted the slaughter of bison herds to remove the primary food source of the Native Americans.

Proud: Two hunters inspect their kill, around 1903. Men on horseback like these had an easy time shooting bison, which could be slow to react to their approach

There is heated debate about the 
existence of an actual government policy that enforced this aim.

Without the buffalo, the American 
Indians could not survive, and without the Indians, European settlers 
were free to claim their lands for themselves.

Witnesses 
reported seeing a sea of black during their annual migrations and 
feeling the ground trembling with the beat of millions of hooves.

For the Plains Indians such as the 
Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Sioux, Comanche and others, the American buffalo 
played an important role not only in their culture and religion but also
in their very survival.

To them, the bison provided an endless supply 
of necessities, and every part of the animal served a purpose.

The 
blood, milk, meat, marrow, organs, testicles, nipples and everything 
down to the nose gristle were eaten, and buffalo tongues and fetuses 
were considered particular delicacies.

Some tribes are described as being part of the 'Buffalo Culture' as the animals were their main source of flesh, hide and bones, and were used to make other items such as food, cups, decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing.

The tribes followed the seasonal grazing and migration of buffalo.

To many Native Americans, the bison was also a symbol of sacred life and abundance.

Skulls were often kept as trophies or
for decoration. In 1842, an observer of the bison migration, Philip 
St. George Cooke, wrote: 'Suddenly a cloud of dust rose over its crest, 
and I heard a rushing noise as of a mighty whirlwind, or the charging 
tramp of ten thousand horses.

'I had not time to divine its cause, when a
herd of buffalo arose over the summit, and a dense mass, thousand upon 
thousand, galloped, with headlong speed, directly upon the pot where I 
stood.

'Still onward they came. Heaven protect me! It was a fearful 
sight.' A fearful sight that was soon never to be seen again.

How the modern bison came to dominate
the North American landscape is still being debated. There is some 
evidence that prior to European colonisation, herds were small and 
regulated by Native American hunters.

It was humans, not bison, who 
dominated the plains landscape, some sources say.

Then the Europeans 
arrived, bringing with them the disease epidemics that wiped out so many
Native Americans and left so much of their vast grasslands empty and 
ready for bison to take over - which they did in huge numbers.

The animals once roamed the 
North American plains from Canada down to Mexico, and as far east as the
western boundary of the Appalachian Mountains.

A major contributor to the 
bison's decimation was the expanding railroad system.

Not only did the 
industry's leaders actively encourage the slaughter of bison, which were a 
nuisance on their tracks, but thanks to them, buffalo products could now
be collected and distributed in larger numbers than ever before.

As the railroads were laid down, they effectively split 
the herds. This new transportation network also made it easy for 
commercial hunters to reach herds further and further out in the plains.

Market hunters like these could kill hundreds of bison in a 
single encounter. In fact some, such as 'Buffalo Bill' Cody, became famous
for slaying thousands during their lifetime.

Killing: A pile of buffalo bones waiting to be loaded onto a train in Canada. The expansion of the railway system across North America was another factor in the decimation of the animal's population

Sad: Wright's buffalo hide yard in Dodge City, Kansas, 1878, with some 40,000 buffalo hides apparently in shot

Hides: Skins hung up to dry in 1926, The Hides were the most prized body parts of the hunted bison and quite often the only parts commercial hunters took

Hundreds of thousands of tons of 
bison bones were used in various industries, including the refining of 
sugar and for making bone china and fertilizer.Â 

The buffalo has become a key symbol in North American culture, and is used in official seals, flags, and logos in both the US and in Canada.

There are currently around 500,000 bison in captive commercial populations on about 4,000 privately owned ranches. However, only 15,000 total individuals are considered wild bison in the natural range within North America.
