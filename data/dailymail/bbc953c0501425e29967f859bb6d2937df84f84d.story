A housewife bitten by a false widow spider says she is now too scared to sleep in her own bedroom after she ended up in intensive care.

Alison Blackburn, 49, has been sleeping on her sofa as she is too terrified to return to the room where she was bitten by Britainâ€™s most venous spider.

Surgeons had to drain the poison from her left foot after the attack, as her ankle ballooned and the pain spread to her pelvic area.

She had been asleep in her bedroom in Stood, Kent, in the early hours of January 10 when she was suddenly woken by a sharp pain in her stomach.

By 6am her partner Gary Pelatt, 50, noticed her foot was red, although it was not painful but within a few hours her foot and ankle had swollen so much she could not get her shoe on. She then visited her family doctor.

'By this time I was feeling very unwell,' said Ms Blackburn. 'I kept going hot and then cold. I was shivering and I was in a lot of pain.'

Recovery: Although Ms Blackburn is now back at home and recovering, she is sleeping on a sofa downstairs - too scared to return to the bedroom where the spider bit her

She was given a prescription, but the swelling became worse. By the evening she had a raging fever and began to hallucinate so Mr Pelatt called an ambulance and she was then taken to hospital.

Ms Blackburn was rushed to Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent where 
she was immediately admitted to intensive care and fed antibiotics 
through a drip.

She spent five days in intensive care and had an operation to drain the poison from her foot to reduce the swelling.

She said:'I was hallucinating things. I thought there was 
water running down all of the walls.

Swollen: Medical staff gave her antibiotics through a drip and allowed her home, but a rash and swelling developed and she had to be rushed back to the hospital by ambulance

'I was burning up and shaking and my heart murmur, which usually can't be heard, was noticed straight away by the paramedics.

'I
 felt so sick. I had pins and needles in my leg, it was throbbing. I was
 slurring my words. I had to have an operation to get rid of all the 
poison in my foot.

'It's been traumatic. People need to know how dangerous these spiders are - they can be lethal.'

After her operation doctors told the mother-of-one was that a false widow spider was likely to have bitten her.

Although she is now back at home and recovering, she is sleeping on a sofa downstairs - too scared to return to the 
bedroom where the spider bit her.

Ms Blackburn has fumigated her house and washed all her 
clothing and bedding in an attempt to get rid of the spider.

But 10 days after the bite she says she is still too terrified to go upstairs in her home.

'I'm still in shock and that spider is still around somewhere,' she said.

'Since coming out of hospital I'm terrified to even be in my own home.

'I can't go upstairs, I sleep on the sofa and I'm having to talk to someone about it because I'm petrified all the time.

'I can't leave the house in the day because of my leg, but I can't face being in the house either.'

The country was hit by a spate of false widow attacks at autumn and an expert has warned that there could be more bites reported in the next few weeks.

Dr John Tweddle, from the life 
sciences department at the Natural History Museum in London, said: 
'There are two main species of false widow spider and they are around 
all year.

'The young reach maturity in September and October, which was why a number of attacks were reported then.

'But they have gone onto become adults and are still a threat.'

He said that Ms Blackburn was right to be concerned that she might be bitten again by the same spider.

Dr Tweddle said : 'Theoretically you can be bitten by the same spider twice.

'They can bite more than once. That is how they kill their prey, unlike bees. It is part of their feeding and defence system.'

False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing.

The species has a brown bulbous abdomen 
with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can 
reach about 15mm in size.

Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom.

The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879, and it is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas.

The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England.

HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE

Do not disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened.

To avoid being bitten while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs.

Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight.

If you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing items.

If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.
