A mother-of-three has lost half of her body weight after her daughter was teased by playground bullies for having a ‘fat mum’.

Emma Dunne, 32, weighed 24 stone when her 10-year-old daughter, Stephanie, complained that children at school were making cruel comments about her size.

'She came home and said, "Mummy, everyone at school says you’re fat",' said Emma, of Gorey, Co Wexford, Ireland.

Emma, pictured here with her son Seamus, 6, and daughters Stephanie, 10, and Siobhan, 7, decided to lose weight after her daughter got bullied at school over her mother's size

'I was absolutely gutted and felt like I had let her down. I wanted to be a mum she could be proud of - not someone who just hid away.'

A busy waitress and a single mother to Stephanie, Siobhan, seven, and Seamus, six, Emma was so big her children could not fully wrap their arms around her to give her a hug.

Having spent years over-indulging on huge portions of shepherd’s pie, takeaways and cheese, Emma vowed to drop the pounds.

'I’d grown to hate my body, and shopping was a nightmare,' said Emma.

'I was so big that I had to buy two pairs of size 28 jeans, cut the waistband off the second pair and use it to extend the first.

'It was so embarrassing. I felt like everyone was staring at me, and I had no confidence.'

But it would prove to be these super-sized jeans that helped Emma drop an astonishing nine dress sizes, to a slim size 10.

After ditching the junk food for fruit and vegetables and taking up running, Emma devised her own unique way to monitor her weight loss.

She would visit the plus-size section of clothes shops, grab a pair of size 28 jeans - which used to be tight for her - and head straight to the changing rooms.

Emma said: 'I know it sounds silly, but seeing my new body in these massive jeans really spurred me on.

'Every time I tried them on and they were even baggier, I could see how much progress I had made.

'On my first time, back in December 2012, I was a size 20, and even then I could see a huge difference.

'By the time I’d dropped to a size 16 in March 2013, I could even fit in one leg. And when I hit a size 12 in November last year, I celebrated by posing with a pair of size 12 jeans.

Her incredible 12 stone weight loss means Stephanie can now put her arms all the way round her mother for the first time in years (right), and her old jeans swamp her new svelte frame (left)

'The shop assistants must have 
thought I was mad, but I really do think it helped me lose all the 
weight. It just proved to me that I never wanted to be that big ever 
again.'

One person who approved of Emma’s unusual weight loss tactic was her daughter, Stephanie.

Although
 her mum had previously been too big for her to hug properly, as the 
weight fell off, Stephanie was able to reach further and further - 
finally cuddling her mum for the first time late last year.

Breakfast: None

Lunch: Large breakfast baguette from the local garage

Dinner: Over-sized portion of home-cooked pasta or shepherd’s pie, with a full block of cheese sprinkled on top. Then a takeaway once the children were asleep

Snacks: Sandwiches, crisps and chocolate

Breakfast: Porridge with almond milk, two poached eggs and a banana

Lunch: Toasted wholemeal wrap with chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber and onions with feta cheese

Dinner: Grilled salmon, broccoli and roasted baby potatoes

Snacks: Almonds, fruit or peppermint tea

Emma says: 'She called it her hug test. Once a week, she would give me a big hug to see how much weight I had lost.'

Since losing the weight, Emma has seen her health improve dramatically.

In June 2013 Emma completed the Flora Women's Mini Marathon

Whilst she used to struggle to walk up the stairs and suffered from sleep apnoea, she now regularly visits the gym and has a passion for weightlifting.

In June 2013, she even completed the Flora Women’s Mini Marathon, which she says she would never have dreamed of attempting before.

'This is a change for life,' said Emma. 'I am so much more confident, and I no longer hide myself away.

'Before, I would stay in my car on the school run. Watching all of the slim, glamorous mums in their skinny jeans reminded me of how much I had let myself go - I was so ashamed.

'When Stephanie told me that other children had said I was fat, I felt like I had let her down too. I wanted to be a mum my kids would be proud of, and I promised myself there and then that I wouldn’t let my kids see me be buried in a super-sized coffin.'

Emma plans to use her weight-loss trick to make sure that she doesn’t slip back into her old ways.

'Every once in a while, I’ll go back to the shops and try on my old-sized jeans,' she said.

'Whenever I’m tempted to order a takeaway or skip my daily run, I’ll think back to how horrible I felt when I had to wear them, and how much better I feel about myself now.

'I’ll never let myself go again. It’s not just my jeans that have gone from super-sized to super-skinny!'
