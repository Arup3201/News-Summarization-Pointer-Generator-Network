Families of victims of the September 11th terrorist attacks are outraged over the proposed changes to TSA policies that will now allow small knives and large athletic equipment like lacrosse sticks of golf clubs on board commercial airplanes.

'I'm really horrified and I would say the majority of 911 family members are really shocked by it,' said Sally Regenhard, the mother of firefighter Christian Regenhard who died trying to save people in the World Trade Center.

Ms Regenhard is just one of the relatives of 9/11 victims who cannot believe that the Transportation Security Administration would allow so many more items past security now after they announced just yesterday that the changes will go into effect because of a review of U.S. regulations.Â

New rules: Flight attendants are balking at the new changes that will lift a number of prohibited items and allow travelers to carry on small knives on board

Remaining restrictions: TSA officials hope that by keeping some banned it will instill less fear in flyers

The TSA said effective April 25, it 
would allow small knives with blades that are 2.36 inches or less in 
length and less than 1/2 inch wide.

Ms Regenhard told MailOnline about a recent flight she took to Los Angeles where the security screener stopped her because she had a small container of yoghurt onto a flight.

'Yoghurt's more dangerous than a pen knife and a golf club!' she said.

'I am vehemently against anyone bringing a pen knife. I don't think there is another 9/11 family who doesn't get on a plane with a lot of trepidation and fear.

'I always think of 9/11. I always think "Is there someone on here who is going to be here who is going to be a terrorist?"'

Another relative, Debra Burlingame, says small pocketknives can be just as lethal as the box cutters that are still banned.

Ms Burlingame's brother was the pilot of the hijacked plane that crashed into the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. The hijackers wielded box cutters.

The families of victims are not the only ones who are upset: the former colleagues of victims are as well.

Specific: The TSA says that the changes reflect the findings of their recent review of security measures

Exemptions: Only certain bats are allowed but many think it is premature to allow any at all

The Association of Professional 
Flight attendants 'categorically rejects a proposal to allow knives of 
any kind in the cabin,' and they don't understand why 'such a momentous 
decision' was made without any consultation.

As
 for some of the larger items that they will now allow, like the sports 
equipment, increases 'the potential for passengers getting hit with 
these items during boarding and deplaning. It's a recipe for disaster,' 
said the APFA representative.

'This is part of an overall Risk-Based
 Security approach, which allows Transportation Security officers to 
better focus their efforts on finding higher-threat items such as 
explosives,' he said.

Travelers will now be allowed to bring 
golf clubs, ski poles and even small knives on planes with them since 
aviation officials have announced significant security changes.

Other items that will be allowed on 
board again as part of a passenger's carry-on luggage include billiard 
cues, ski poles, hockey sticks and lacrosse sticks.

Items that had been prohibited like razors, box cutters or knives with a fixed blade are still not allowed on board.

The restrictions about liquids are 
still in place as well, meaning that anything under 3-ounces must be 
declared at the security checkpoint.

Loosening the reins: TSA officials have changed their stance on certain banned objects which will now be allowed on planes starting on April 25

No longer a threat? Billiard cues and lacrosse sticks will be allowed on board now

The 
Flight Attendants Union Coalition, which represents nearly 90,000 flight
 attendants from carriers across the country, called the decision a 
'poor and shortsighted decision' by the TSA.

'As the last line of defense in the cabin
 and key aviation partners, we believe that these proposed changes will 
further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers 
we work so hard to keep safe and secure,' the coalition said in a 
statement.

TSA spokesman David Castelveter said the
 decision was made to bring U.S. regulations more in line with 
International Civil Aviation Organization standards and would also help 
provide a better experience for travelers.

Castelveter said the TSA has implemented a
 number of safety measures including reinforced cockpit doors, allowing 
some pilots to be armed and federal air marshals on board airplanes. He 
said those measures would help ensure safety of the passengers and crew.
