The parents of a 19-year-old who died in California after smoking one hit of synthetic marijuana are determined that his death won't be in vain.

Devin and Veronica Eckhardt never imagined they would be watching a helicopter bearing their only son's heart fly away from the Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach.

But on Thursday July 17 they honored Connor Eckhardt's wishes to donate his organs following his death after smoking a synthetic marijuana known as 'spice' the previous Saturday.

Now, the family is sharing photographs of 
Connor's life and death, in the hope that their son's tragic passing 
will serve as a warning to others about the dangers of synthetic 
marijuana.

'He gave into (peer pressure) — thinking that it was okay, it was somehow safe — and one hit later, he goes to sleep and never wakes up,' Connor’s father, Devin Eckhardt told KTLA.

Also known as K2, spice is a mixture of herbs that's sprayed with a chemical to produce a similar sensation to marijuana.

The herbs and chemicals in spice vary, making it impossible for users to know what they're smoking and in what concentrations.

'These substances are not benign,' Dr Andrew Monte, the lead author of an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, told the ststion.

'People may not realize how dangerous these drugs can be – up to 1,000 times stronger binding to cannabis receptors when compared to traditional marijuana.'

Incredibly, it's readily available in shops and online, even though the sale of it is illegal in California.

Synthetic marijuana has been labeled incense, potpourri and herbal smoking blend — and it's been sold using names such as K2 and Spice.

Connor Eckhardt fell asleep after taking a hit of spice.

His brain, deprived of oxygen, began to swell and he slipped into a coma.

Precious moments: The Eckhardts spent four days with their son before he was taken in to surgery to remove his organs for donation

Doctors were unable to detect spice in COnnor's system because there's no way to trace its everchanging components, but the package of the drug was still in his pocket, and no other drugs were found in his system.

Connor's decision to become an organ donor gave his family four more precious days with him as doctors found recipients and prepared for the tranfer of Connor's heart and other vital organs.

Veronica, Devin and Connor's sisters Sabrina and five-year-old Ashnika gathered by his bedside and memorized the lines of his face, touched his hair and kissed his forehead.

'I just keep thinking he's going to open his eyes and go, "What's up, guys?"' Veronica Eckhardt said, reported the Los Angeles Times.

Veronica painted the soles of his feet and made a print, just as she had when she and Devin adopted a tiny Connor as a baby.

Sabrina Eckhardt is just a year and a half younger than her brother and she, like the other two Eckhardt children, was adopted.

Meaning from loss: The family is determined that Connor's death will not be in vain and are spreading his story to warn others

She and Connor were extremely close and she is struggling to come to terms with her brother's loss.

The Eckhardts used their last precious minutes with Connor, a California boy whose bronzed skin was a testament to his love of surfing and skateboarding, to do something incredibly brave.

They filmed a short video by Connor's comatose side, about the dangers of synthetic marijuana.

'This is our son, Connor Reid Eckhardt,' Veronica said, her voice raw with emotion.

'He made the deadly choice to use a product called K2, or spice, and Connor is completely brain-dead... This is not a game, it is totally real, please help us fight his fight.'

They have created a Facebook page as both a memorial to Connor and a warning to others about the perils of synthetic marijuana.

'Connor Eckhardt died after taking ONE HIT of synthetic marijuana (SPICE, K2, POTpourri). This dangerous substance is legal. Help us save lives by sharing,' reads the page's description. So far, it has 32,098 likes.
