Posh nosh: Chef Bruno Loubet is hoping to oust curries and pizza with his Michelin-starred takeaways

Diners no longer have to venture out for posh nosh thanks to a French chef who has launched Britain's first Michelin-starred takeaway.

Bruno Loubet's is hoping to make greasy curries and pizzas a thing of the past by delivering his world class French cuisine - with dishes such as duck confit and tarragon chicken - to people's doors.

The Bordeaux-born chef has designed a fine dining menu for gourmet takeaway service Housebites, which operates in London and Brighton.

Loubet, who earned a Michelin star while head chef at the Four Seasons, Inn on the Park, in London, said: 'It is really nice and makes a change from curry and pizza.

'This is good for the image of French food - simple and very tasty. For too long French cuisine has been restricted to up-market restaurants.

'French cooking represents everything that is exciting, creative and comforting about today’s foodie world, and we’re giving people the chance to enjoy some of the best French dishes at home.'

Loubet, who runs Bistro Bruno Loubet at The Zetter Hotel in Clerkenwell, London, has trained 35 chefs how to prepare his new takeaway dishes, which can be ordered via the Housebites website.

The food is then prepared in the chef’s kitchen before being delivered to the customer.

Mouth-watering: Duck confit is one of the dishes which can been ordered online

Dishes include slow roast pork belly with aromatic mustard salsa for £11.95 and gratin of caramelised fennel, butternut squash, courgette and garlic confit with bearnaise sauce for £9.95.

The duck confit in honey and wholegrain mustard crust, sherry vinegar sauce, beetroot marmalade is priced at £12.95, while the vinegar and tarragon chicken fricassie with cherry tomatoes, grapes and button mushrooms £10.95

There is also a dessert of French toast with cider vinegar and toffee apple for £5.95.
