No wonder the Prime Minister looks aghast. He is standing inside a squalid shed in the back garden of a suburban London house.

It has a concrete floor, a half-built roof open to the wintry sky, and is strewn with dirty mattresses, battered suitcases and plastic bags.

Yet yesterday it emerged that the shack, with one of its four walls missing and covered instead by a blue cotton sheet, is home to a number of  Indian immigrants living illegally in Britain.

Grim: The Prime Minister appears taken aback as he is confronted by the rubbish, piled up suitcases and grubby blankets of this wretched squat in an outbuilding in Southall

In total 14 people were living a three-bedroom home and the shack built in the garden.

The
 inhabitants are just a few of the tens of thousands of new arrivals who
 pay shadowy landlords exorbitant rents to stay in so-called ‘beds in 
sheds’ in back gardens across outer London and the Home Counties.

As
 the country struggles to accommodate the huge numbers of immigrants 
arriving here – both legally and illegally – this is often the sad and 
degrading fate that awaits them.

The
 scene of squalor, hidden away behind a house in an avenue in Southall, 
West London, where property prices top £400,000, is all too common.

Crackdown: Some 10 officers raided the house at 5am yesterday, making three arrests with more expected

Quiet: The property used to house 14 illegal immigrants sits on this quiet residential street in Southall, London (general view)

A government crackdown on immigration is 'really spitting in the wind of the problem we face', a Tory MP warned yesterday.

Philip Davis also predicted that new benefit restrictions would be found illegal in the European courts.

He added 'The only way to get control of our borders back, and control of our benefits system, is to leave the European Union.'

But David Cameron insisted that ministers had taken legal advice on limiting access to benefits to those who have been in the UK for three months.

'There is a right to work in different countries of the European Union but there shouldn't be a right to claim in different countries of the European Union,' the PM said.

Earlier
 this year, the local council – Ealing – estimated that the inhabitants 
of bed sheds has pushed the area’s population up by 60,000 to nearly 
400,000.

It has meant 
schools struggle to cope with huge increases in pupils. GP surgeries and
 health services are overwhelmed while rubbish collection and sanitation
 services reel under the extra burden.

I have seen the appalling conditions in which these newcomers live for myself.

Earlier
 this year I visited neighbouring Hounslow, a borough where there are 
20,000 gardens with ramshackle sheds or outbuildings of all sizes, a lot of them rented out illegally to migrants, mainly from India.

As local councillor Sheila O’Reilly told me: ‘Once, it was a rural scene around here. Now, many areas resemble shanty towns.’

I was led by a council enforcement team to a cream-painted house on a leafy road which looked perfectly respectable.

Yet
 in the back garden was a jerry-built shack thrown together with breeze 
blocks – and distinct signs of human habitation. When I poked my head 
inside the door, the smell made my eyes water.

Message: The Prime Minister said it was vital to send home people who don't have a right to be here

The
 tiny, cramped outbuilding was home to eight Indians illegally living in
 Britain, including a young woman, who paid hundreds of pounds a month 
to a rogue landlord who owned a thriving grocery shop a few miles away.

At the time of my visit, Hounslow had already inspected more than 2,000 bed sheds in its area – and was still counting.

When
 discovered, some are torn down because they break planning rules. All 
too often though, red tape and lax laws mean that the landlord receives 
only a warning.

The council 
must also give home-owners 24 hours’ notice of an inspection, which, of 
course, gives them ample time to clear out a back-garden shack.

Illegal: Mr Cameron said he wanted to see more raids being made of properties used to house people in the UK illegally

In
 London suburbs and the Home Counties it is thought that tens of thousands bed 
sheds now exist, each housing up to ten people. It is a huge secret 
population living under the radar.

'We are dealing with the mess that we inherited from Labour, when immigration was completely out of control'

Prime Minister David Cameron

Yesterday
 Mr Cameron was confronting the harsh reality of a decade or more of 
uncontrolled migration and the utter misery it can bring to everyone – 
including the migrants themselves.

Mr
 Cameron said it was vital to ‘send home people who don’t have a right 
to be here’, as he set out plans to prevent migrants claiming benefits 
for three months after arriving in Britain.

He
 also said landlords would risk big fines if they fail to check the 
status of their tenants under the terms of a new Immigration Bill.

Curbs: The visit came after the government announced it was rushing forward legislation to stop migrants claiming benefits for the first three months they are in Britain

Briefing: Mr Cameron was told that the three-bedroom house had been converted into 10 bedrooms and up to 14 people in the house

‘We
 are dealing with the mess that we inherited from Labour, when 
immigration was completely out of control,’ the Prime Minister said. Ten 
officers raided the terraced house at 5am and made three arrests of 
Indian nationals.

The 
Government is scrambling to toughen its immigration message as Britain 
is forced to remove restrictions on incomers from Romania and Bulgaria 
on January 1.

Ministers have
 set out a series of measures to limit migrant access to public services
 and benefits. Landlords will be fined up to £3,000 if they rent a 
property to an illegal immigrant.

But
 more than 70 Tory MPs are calling for Mr Cameron to go further and 
flout EU rules by extending the controls on Romanian and Bulgarian 
migrants until 2018.
