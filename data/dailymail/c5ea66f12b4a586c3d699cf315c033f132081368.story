As power was finally restored to six 
million, officials from Arizona's largest electric utility said on 
Friday they are still baffled by the chain of events that caused massive
blackouts across Arizona, California and parts of Mexico.

APS has said they believe a single 
employee at the North Gila substation tripped a 500-kV transmission line
that runs from Arizona to Southern California.

They are investigating how that happened and the subsequent failure of safeguards that should have prevented major outages.

Darker than usual: Despite lights showing in San Diego buildings, the city was without power after a blackout on caused havoc on Thursday

Daniel Froetscher, Vice President of 
Energy Delivery for APS, said: 'We’re struggling. We have to take a hard
look at the system design and figure out exactly what happened. We 
don’t know the underlying causes.'

Early Thursday, APS officials noticed
an issue with a series capacitor at the North Gila substation outside 
the city of Yuma, Mr Froetscher said.

The capacitor — a piece of equipment 
about the size of a small car that helps the utility manage voltage — 
wasn’t functioning properly.

APS personnel were dispatched to take it offline, the LA Times.

Typically, the utility can shut down an individual capacitor and reroute power without any disruption of service, Mr Froetscher said.

But this time, something went wrong. After the North Gila capacitor was taken offline, the 500-kV line that runs through the substation went down.

At that point, 3.27pm, the grid should have compensated for the loss of the 500-kV line, which runs from Yuma to the Imperial Valley and San Diego.

'The intent is for the system to automatically open and close different breakers and relays and switches to reroute power from the line that was lost to other lines to continue to provide service,' he said.

'Transmission lines do go out of service on an unplanned basis; it’s not an unusual event. Most times when a line goes out unexpectedly, the system performs exactly as it’s expected to and customers never know the difference.'

Rebecca Wilder, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates electric utilities in the state, said the agency was monitoring the APS investigation.

Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which operates most of the state’s electric grid, insisted that it’s too early to even theorize about the cause of the San Diego power outage or its size.

'Someone who comes to conclusions quickly doesn’t know what he is talking about,' she said, noting that a similar massive outage struck parts of California on August 10, 1996, with the loss of a 500-kV high-voltage transmission line from the Pacific Northwest that is similar to the Southwestern Power Link that went down Thursday in Arizona.

The blackout was a reminder that U.S. transmission lines remain vulnerable to cascading power failures.

There have been several similar failures in recent years. In 2003, a blackout knocked out power to 50 million people in the Midwest and the Northeast. And in 2005, a major outage struck the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the Associated Press reports.

That same year, Congress required utilities to comply with federal reliability standards for the electricity grid, instead of self-regulation. Layers of safeguards and backups were intended to isolate problems and make sure the power keeps flowing.

But that didn't happen on Thursday.

The San Diego County Sheriff's Department and other police departments told 10News.com  they received reports of break-ins and vandalism at homes and businesses.

The Sheriff's department received reports of a glass door broken at a taco store in Lemon Grove and a report of a home break-in in Vista during the outage.

A suspect in San Diego was arrested after he was found to have items from a Kensington area home where neighbours had reported a possible robbery.

APS, Arizona's largest electricity provider, said a utility worker doing maintenance near Yuma triggered the blackout.

The error, on a high-voltage power line linking Arizona and San Diego, causing a cascading series of electrical grid failures stretching into Southern California.

Authorities say the outage was accidentally triggered sometime Thursday afternoon when the APS electrical worker removed a piece of monitoring equipment at a power substation in southwest Arizona.

An APS statement said: 'The outage appears to be related to a procedure an APS employee was carrying out in the North Gila substation.

'Operating and protection protocols 
typically would have isolated the resulting outage to the Yuma area. The
reason that did not occur in this case will be the focal point of the 
investigation into the event, which already is underway.'

Daniel Froetscher, an APS vice president, said authorities
quickly ruled out any sabotage or, in the anxious days leading up to 
the 10th anniversary of Sept. 11 attacks, any suggestion of terrorism.

'This was not a deliberate act. The employee was just switching out a piece of equipment that was problematic.'

For obvious reasons, APS did not name the employee.

It's possible that extreme heat in the region also may have caused some problems with the transmission lines, one expert said.

Many minor traffic accidents occurred as the outage caused mayhem on streets without stoplights during rush hour.

Leah Walden, 59, of California, said she saw about five fender-bender crashes on one trip out.

Ms Walden said: 'People are irritated. They don't want to wait.'

In the beach town of Encinitas north of San Diego, Tim Grenda, 41, put a positive spin on the situation, pointing out that his hot yoga class was cooler as a result of the outage.

Rosa Maria Gonzales, a spokeswoman with the Imperial Irrigation District in California's sizzling eastern desert, was less enthusiastic - temperatures were well into triple-digit territory when the power went out.

Ms Gonzales said: 'It feels like you're in an oven and you can't escape.'

Many offices closed during the outage but workers were caught in gridlock conditions because traffic lights were out.

Early Friday morning, power was on the way to being restored for some six million people affected by the outage.

Nearly
700,000 of the 1.4million customers who lost power Southern California 
saw their lights come on at about 2:45am local time, the Los Angeles 
Times reported.

Hospital
emergency rooms switched to backup generators, while police stations 
also had to rely on generators to accept emergency calls across the area
and officers struggled to direct traffic at intersections where signals
were out.

The blackout extended from southern 
Orange County to San Diego to Yuma, Arizona. It is also affecting cities
south of the border, with much of the state of northern Baja in 
darkness.

'It
feels like you're in an oven and you can't escape,' said Rosa Maria 
Gonzales, a spokeswoman with the Imperial Irrigation District in 
California's sizzling eastern desert.

It was about 115 degrees when the power went out for about 150,000 of its customers, she said.

FBI officials ruled out terrorism 
while power plant authorities struggled to find the cause of the outage 
that started shortly before 4pm local time.

A
transmitter line between Arizona and California was severed, said Mike 
Niggli, chief operating officer of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., 
causing the outage.

The extreme heat in some areas also may have caused 
some problems with the lines.

People were trapped in elevators and on rides at Sea World in San Diego and Legoland in Carlsbad.

The San Onofre nuclear power plant 
went offline at 3.30pm as they are programmed to do when there is a 
disturbance in the power grid, said Charles Coleman, a spokesman from Southern California Edison. He said there was no danger to the public or to workers there.

The
outage came more than eight years after a more severe black out in 2003
darkened a large swath of the Northeast and Midwest. More than 50 million people were affected in that outage.

Five
hundred to 2,000 SoCal Edison customers in southern Orange County and 
Riverside County are currently without power and there is no estimate 
for when power will be restored, Coleman said.

Capt. Mike Stone of the Orange County Fire Authority said several people were trapped and rescued at the tony Ritz Carlton hotel in south Orange County, Stone said.

In southern Orange County, the sheriff's department dispatched deputies to busy intersections because traffic lights were out, said John McDonald, a sheriff's spokesman.

Outages were confirmed in San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano and Laguna Hills, he said.
