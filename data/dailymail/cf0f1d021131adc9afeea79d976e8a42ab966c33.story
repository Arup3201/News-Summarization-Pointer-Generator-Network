The widow of Kentucky policeman Jason Ellis, who was lured into a deadly ambush and killed on Saturday, has told of the heartbreaking moment she had to tell her two sons their father wouldn't be coming home.

Amy Ellis yesterday paid tribute to her 'superman' husband who had served for seven years as an officer with Bardstown Police department.

She said she could think of no reason anyone would want to hurt such a happy, dedicated family man.

Devoted: Jason and Amy Ellis, who met at college on Valentine's Day 12 years ago, with their sons

Hero: Bardstown police officer Jason Elllis was lured to his death on a remote Kentucky road

Widow: Amy Ellis pays tribute to her husband and father of her two boys, who was shot dead

The couple met on Valentine's Day 12 years ago at Williamsburg College and had two sons Hunter and Parker aged six and seven.

She also told of the agony of 
sharing the news of his death with her two sons, who idolized their 
father.

'He wanted to make sure everybody was 
having a good time around him. He was a dedicated family man. He loved 
our boys. He loved me,' she said.

'I've laid on the bathroom floor.  I 
did not want to live another second without him.  I don't have the 
strength to pray right now, but I know that many others are praying for 
me and our family.

'Now I know I have to be strong for our kids.' 

'[The children are doing] as good as can be expected. They know their daddy is not coming 
back. The oldest, he got hurt and that’s when 
he started letting it all out. He screamed and screamed and screamed and
said he wanted his daddy.'

Looking for answers: Amy Ellis joined her husbands colleagues at a press conference about his death

Tribute: Residents of Bardstown have left flowers and baseballs on Officer Ellis's police cruiser

Officer Ellis, 33, was driving home at about 2.30am on Saturday when he stopped to clear debris from the road.

Police
believe it was left as a deliberate attempt to lure him from 
the safety of his car.

As he got out at the Blue Grass Parkway in Nelson
County, he was shot multiple times.

Police believe the gunman acted quickly 
because Officer Ellis had not reached for his gun. His body was found 
next to his cruiser, with its lights still flashing.

According to the Courier Journal the force received a call at 2.53am reporting an accident involving an officer in the area.

A state trooper arrived and found Officer Ellis dead.

Mystery still surrounds why the
policeman was targeted. He was driving home in a pool car and did not radio for help. 

The k-9 officer did not have his dog with him and the animal has now been given to his children as a pet. 

The attacker was branded a
'true coward' by Chief of Bardstown police Rick McCubbin who added that colleagues of the slain officer would not rest until he has been caught or killed.

'This was, as I said, methodical, 
precise, set up, planned and executed in a perfect fashion 
unfortunately,' Chief McCubbin told WKYT.

'It’s not something that happened randomly. No one has that kind of luck.'

'We won't give up on 
this person until we have him either in custody or in the front side of 
one of our weapons and I personally hope the latter is the choice.'

Though the motive
is not yet clear, Officer Ellis had been credited with making a 
'dent' in the town's drug population.

The reward for information leading to the arrest of the gunman is now $32,000 after the city donated $10,000 to the fund in memory of Officer Ellis, who is the first Bardstown police officer to be killed on duty.

Flags are flying at half-mast in the 
town and Bardstown police say they will retire Officer Ellis's police 
dog, Figo, as way of honoring his memory, as well as donating him to his children.

On Monday 300 people attended a 
candlelight vigil for Officer Ellis. Flowers and baseballs were left 
over the officer's car, which had been parked outside the police 
station, which serves a community of 12,000 people.

In the meantime Mrs Ellis and her sons have to come to terms with his loss. 

'I wanted to thank everyone for their support, honor, love and prayers,' she said of the outpouring of community support she has received. 

Remebering him she added: 'Where do I even start?  His goofy smile, the way he always made us 
laugh, his smell, just being able to hug him and kiss him, and just 
seeing him with our boys.'

'He was my best friend, she added.
