A young couple were left stunned after an elaborate wedding proposal ended with a surprise appearance from U2 frontman, Bono.

Cliff Henry, 30, had arranged to pop the question to his childhood sweetheart Fiona Hehir during a trip to Killiney Hill overlooking Dublin Bay in Ireland.

Unbeknown to Miss Hehir, Cliff had enlisted the help of Dublin-based band Keywest, who had agreed to perform a rendition of her favourite song, Raglan Hill, once the couple reached the top.

Henry, a longtime fan of Keywest, ran into the group on Grafton Street in Dublin and after watching them perform told them about his plans to propose on October 29, which was Fiona’s 30th birthday.

He had even organised a covert film crew to capture the moment.

When Keywest dedicated the song to ‘Fiona and Cliff’, he went down on one knee.

She was so surprised that Cliff had to ask her twice before she managed to say 'yes'.

However, there was more drama to follow, when the couple unexpectedly bumped into U2 star Bono and his wife Ali, who were also visiting Killiney Hill that day.

The 54-year-old singer, real name Paul Hewson, then recorded the pair a message, joking: ‘Fiona don’t do it, don’t do this!

‘We know him, you’re just getting to know him. There’s a gang of us here, there’s an intervention!

‘But if you have to go ahead, just know that marriage is like an act of grand madness.

‘You jump off the top of Killiney Hill and discover that you actually can fly.’

The couple's engagement video appeared online and has since gone viral. 

Following the huge response online, Fiona claimed it was ‘like getting engaged all over again’.

The couple have yet to begin planning their wedding as they are both busy with work.

However, she shared that Keywest have promised to play at their wedding.

The band are well known for their street performances, especially on Dublin's Grafton Street, and which have attracted huge crowds.
