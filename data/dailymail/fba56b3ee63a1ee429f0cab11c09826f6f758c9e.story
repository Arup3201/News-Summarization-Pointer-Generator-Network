The Duke of Cambridge has backed calls for a public inquiry into the case of three men who were mown down and killed by a car during the Birmingham riots of 2011.

MailOnline can exclusively reveal it is the first time Prince William has expressed his support for the idea in the case of Haroon Jahan, 20, and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31.

The trio were killed in Dudley Road in the Winson Green area of Birmingham in the early hours of August 10, 2011 as they tried to protect businesses from looters.

During a private meeting with Haroon's father Tariq and senior police officers and community leaders in Balsall Heath, Birmingham, on Friday, the Duke threw his weight behind proposals for an investigation into why there has been no justice for the families of the three men.

Eight men were charged with their murder, but were cleared by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court after a senior officer was accused during the case of lying on oath about the late disclosure of an offer to give eye-witnesses immunity from prosecution.

A subsequent IPCC report cleared him of any wrongdoing but did criticise another officer for making the offers of immunity, though he has faced no punishment as he has since retired.

Abdullah Rehman, who is CEO of the Balsall Heath Forum community group and was at the meeting, said: 'The Prince had asked to meet Tariq for an update on the case.

'It was quite amazing. He showed real sympathy towards him and his situation. 

'We feel there had been no accountability (because of) the fact eight men were cleared of this horrific act during the riots.

'We feel the police, the CPS, and the judge were completely incompetent and we as a community are asking for accountability. The Prince listened.

'He then spoke directly to Tariq and said some really reassuring words: never to underestimate himself, keep his chin up and he was 100 per cent backing a public inquiry, which was great news.'

Detective Chief Inspector Anthony Tagg was adamant in court during the murder trial that he had disclosed the relevant information regarding the offers of immunity.

He and another officer, Detective Inspector Khalid Kiyani, were investigated after the accused walked free.

The judge had to tell the jury to disregard much of the evidence and the eight accused were cleared.

The second in line to the throne impressed community leaders with his knowledge of the case 

He said he was 'not just words' and was lobbying senior officers for a public inquiry

The IPCC examined the manner of the police probe into the deaths and declared it had been mishandled in a finding unveiled in May this year.

During the trial the judge accused DCI Tagg of having lied on oath about the late disclosure of an offer to give eyewitnesses immunity from prosecution.

The IPCC report said Mr Tagg had no case to answer for misconduct.

But it ruled DI Kiyani had acted recklessly in offering immunity to witnesses at a public meeting and would have faced misconduct charges had he not retired in 2012.

The new West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson and his deputy Yvonne Mosquito were also at the discussion on Friday

After the meeting with the Duke, Mr Rehman told BBC West Midlands radio interviewer Arshia Riaz: 'It was quite overwhelming really, the way he talked to Tariq, the way he spoke to all of us and the sympathy that he showed towards this whole injustice was really heartwarming.'

Mr Rehman said the Duke insisted he was 'not just words' but he was talking with senior police officers and the Governor General to get a public inquiry.

He said the Prince wanted it 'to happen as soon as possible because there is an amount of trust that has been lost.'

He added: 'In my job it is a big disadvantage if people in the community do not trust the police and the justice system.

'The meeting was really heart-warming and has given us a lot of confidence that there will be a public inquiry now.

'With the fact that the crime commissioner and the deputy crime commissioner were there as well, we hope something will come from this.

'I think there will be more support now the Prince has given his approval and this will get the ball rolling.'

Mr Rehman paid tribute to William's knowledge of the case and the way he made everyone feel at ease.

'I didn't know what to expect, but the Prince was really down to earth', he said.

'I do think it is down to his wonderful mother and the way she brought him up.

'How he welcomed us, spoke to us and how he really put us at ease when we were talking to him and the compassion he showed Tariq was really heart-warming.'

The atmosphere on the streets of Birmingham was extremely tense after the deaths of the three young men in 2011, with some groups calling for revenge.

Mr Jahan was credited with restoring calm after urging local youths to put their faith in the justice system.

But his own faith in that system has since been sorely tested after he was denied justice for the death of his son.

Mr Jahan wrote on Facebook that his bid for a public inquiry had also been backed by the family of the two brothers who died alongside Haroon.

He posted pictures of his meeting with the Prince on the site and wrote: 'The Prince has given his full support and backing in calling for a public inquiry into the case of the three murdered boys.

'Three years on we still need answers and ultimately justice.'

A spokesman for Clarence House declined to comment on the meeting, but did say the Duke has met privately with Mr Jahan on each of his last three visits to Birmingham. 

This includes last week's trip, with the other two taking place in 2011 and 2013.

A statement from West Midlands Police said: 'A comprehensive and high profile investigation was carried out in relation to the deaths of Haroon Jahan, Shazad Ali, and Abdul Musavir.

'Extensive evidence was presented to the Crown Prosecution Service, who authorised the charge of eight men with murder.

'Following a lengthy crown court hearing they were found not guilty of murder by a jury on July 19, 2012.

'If substantial new information or evidence were to become available, it would examined by West Midlands Police, and if appropriate we would take it to the Crown Prosecution Service for their consideration.

'However it is difficult to see where that evidence could come from. What happened that night and who was involved was not really in dispute.

'The jury, having heard all the evidence and having seen all the CCTV, decided that the defendants were innocent.

'The judge therefore remarked that what happened must have been a terrible accident.'
