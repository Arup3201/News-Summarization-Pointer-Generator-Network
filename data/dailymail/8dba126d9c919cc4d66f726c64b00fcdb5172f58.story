A newborn lamb whose ears were hacked off by yobs is on the mend – thanks to his new bonnet.

The sickening attack took place last month, when Nelson was three weeks old. Determined not to put him down, farmer Val Gunn and her husband Kenneth took him in as a pet, and nursed him back to health.

He was pictured yesterday grazing in the garden of their country farmhouse, wearing a cotton bonnet to protect his wounds.

Mrs Gunn, 71, said they fitted Nelson with the headgear after he got
sunstroke two weeks ago.

‘Where his ears were it’s really pink and 
delicate, so we wanted something to protect him from the elements,’ she 
said. ‘He could get all sorts of damage from the weather because the 
ears form a lot of protection.’

She continued: ‘He seems quite a happy little chappy, which he certainly deserves. People 
were ringing me in tears and offering to give him a home, but we’ve become quite fond of him now.

'And one thing’s for sure – he isn’t going to end up on anyone’s dinner plate.’

She added: ‘I wouldn't like him to have earache. The poor little soul's suffered enough, with what has been done to him.

‘As 
he keeps getting bigger we will have to make him more and more hats.

‘I think he might need a wardrobe for them soon.

‘He's become somewhat of a local celebrity since the attack. We've had strangers come just to visit him to check if he's OK. 

‘He's not going anywhere, his place is here now.’

The RSPCA - who branded the attack as ‘horrendous’ - is investigating the incident and appealing for witnesses to contact them.

A spokesman said: ‘We've not had any leads on this, but we are still investigating and would appeal to anyone with information to get in touch. 

‘This is absolutely horrific and I cannot believe that someone would deliberately cause such an awful injury to an innocent animal.’
