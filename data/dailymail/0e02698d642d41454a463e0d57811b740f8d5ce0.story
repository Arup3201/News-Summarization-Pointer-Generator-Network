Famous jewelry-maker Lorraine Schwartz lost a $250,000 ring at this year's Golden Globes and it turns out a greedy carpet cleaner found the gem and tried to hawk it.

Schwartz told police in January that the ring with a 10.62 carat yellow diamond might have been stolen off of her finger at the ceremony, TMZ reports.

But it turns out the ring simply fell off and landed on the red carpet.

Bling: Jewelry-designer Lorraine Schwartz lost a $250,000 ring at this year's Golden Globes. It later turned up when a carpet cleaner tried to get it appraised

Which hand? Schwartz was wearing at least two rings that night. It's uncertain whether the ring she lost was on her left or right hand

Caught in the act: The ring turned up with carpet cleaner Henry Bernal took it to a gem appraiser after trying to sell the ring

That's when carpet cleaner Henry Bernal picked it up and took it home to his girlfriend, Christina Gonzales, law enforcement officials said.

The couple then took the ring to Kevin Jewelers, but when the store offered to buy the jewel, they instead decided to get it certified by the Gemological Institute of America.

However, the GIA notified cops once Bernal came in, since the gem already had a certification number.

Bernal allegedly told cops that he didn't turn the ring in because he doesn't trust law enforcement.

The theft is currently under investigatiomn by local police and the FBI.Â
