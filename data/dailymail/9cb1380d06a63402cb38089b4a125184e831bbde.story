Mitt Romney is clearly a family-friendly Mormon man who has kept life simple with a stable marriage entering its fifth decade.

So it’s no surprise that the former Massachusetts governor’s biggest vice is not alcohol, drugs or women - but something a little less outlandish.

Ann Romney, his wife of 42 years, told Parade magazine that ‘something bad’ he likes to drink is ‘Over the Moon’ low-fat chocolate milk.

Mr Romney enjoys cold cereal and Diet Coke. ‘I’m always trying to get him to drink more water,’ Mrs Romney told Parade. ‘That’s a struggle for me.’

His favourite cereals are Sugar Chex Bites and Quaker Oatmeal Squares, while he loves hot chocolate instead of the Mormon-banned coffee or tea.

Mrs Romney also revealed he loves listening to The Beatles, Rolling Stones and Neil Diamond - but his favourite artist is Roy Orbison.

‘People see him as a business guy, but he has a silly side,’ she said. ‘He loves to roll on the floor with our grandkids. And he’s a prankster.’

Mr Romney’s campaign team is highlighting his domestic bliss and alluding to competitor Newt Gingrich’s three marriages and two divorces.

‘What he could bring to the presidency (is) exactly what the country needs right now,’ Mrs Romney told Parade. ‘This is now Mitt’s time.’

He is trying to cast himself as stable and conservative-friendly, labelling Mrs Romney as the ‘most extraordinary wife in the world’.

The two met in the basement of a friend’s house. He had given her a ride home from their friend's house and they shared a first kiss.

According to Mr Romney, they’ve been ‘going steady’ ever since, although she has had to battle multiple sclerosis. They have had five sons together.

‘She’s a fighter and my hero. If there’s any one thing that distinguishes me from everybody else, it’s that person that I share my life with,' he said.

Mr Gingrich has been divorced twice, in part because of his infidelity. He’s been married three times and has apologised to potential voters for his bad behaviour.

He needs to win the vote of social conservatives, or ‘value voters’ who often come from the Bible Belt and feel his past is a big problem.
