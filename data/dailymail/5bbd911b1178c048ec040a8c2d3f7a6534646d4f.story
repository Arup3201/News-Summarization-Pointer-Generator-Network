Welcome to the party where being a stick in the mud is not a bad thing at all. While feathers, sequins and skin are trademarks of Carnival celebrations in Brazil, there's no room for them at the Bloco da Lama.

At this down and dirty fiesta it's all about swamp creatures and lashings of dark, black mud. And while bikinis are the outfit of choice, they're not visible for long as one woman in a white bikini quickly discovered.  

'She's so clean, it makes me want to hug her,' said a reveller freshly emerged from the mud who helped the woman fit in with her muddy mates.

Instead of the usual feathers, sequins and skin-revealing costumes of Carnival, Bloco da Lama features wacky swamp creatures

The dark, slimy mud might be a turn off for some but romance is still in the air at this Carnival 'street' party in Brazil

The coastal colonial town of Paraty, in Rio de Janeiro state, is home to the event that translated from Portuguese to English means Mud Street Party at which revellers make the most of the Atlantic's mineral-rich soil.

'Usually when you think of Brazilian Carnival, you think of sequins and feathers - not mud,' said French tourist Marion Douchet, 28, as she smeared the sludge onto the back of her neck and the few other spots clean skin was still visible. 'It's fun, it's original and it's exotic.'

Patricia Azevedo, who owns a hotel in town, said the mud was helping her beat the intense mid-summer heat.

'When you go to a normal "bloco" you're all packed together like sardines and it gets insanely hot,' said Azevedo, 43, a vine tiara giving her swamp creature look the crowning touch. 'The mud is really refreshing - plus I don't even need sunscreen.' 

The Bloco da Lama, which translates from Portuguese to English as 'Mud Street Party', takes place every year in Paraty

Far from a centuries-old spiritual or religious occasion, this 'bloco' is said to have been born in 1986 after local teens hiking in a nearby mangrove forest smeared themselves with mud to discourage mosquitoes and then wandered through Paraty.

Since then the festivities have evolved steadily, although local shopkeepers grew so weary of the revellers traipsing the hard-to-remove mud through the downtown and staining white walls and walkways that they banned them.  

No worry though, as party-goers now dance on the beach to a soundtrack of Brazilian funk and house music while chanting 'uga, uga' like cavemen.

Roar! Being swamp creatures doesn't mean this family can't shoot a smile down the lens 

As the afternoon wears on, the amount of empty beer cans on the beach multiply and mud pies begin to fly from the eager hands of teenagers while a pair of men play wrestle on the sand. 

'It's good spirited fun,' Azevedo said. 'I mean, I haven't looked at myself in the mirror, I'm sure I look ridiculous. But then again, everyone does.'
