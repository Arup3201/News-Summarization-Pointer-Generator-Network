Scared: Lauren Booth said 'grown men looking like they want to hit Muslim women' on public transport after the murder of Lee Rigby

Tony Blair’s Muslim sister-in-law yesterday claimed she lives in fear of being attacked following the murder of soldier  Lee Rigby.

Lauren Booth, who converted two years ago, said ‘grown men look like they want to hit her’ when she takes public transport in London in traditional Islamic dress.

The half-sister of Cherie Blair made the comments on television as she attacked Mr Blair for ‘overseeing a war where a million people who are Muslim have been killed’.

Her appearance was immediately mocked by viewers, who accused Miss Booth, 45, of being an ‘attention seeker’ and ‘misguided’ for suggesting she could be a victim of the terror attack in Woolwich.

Miss Booth, who has also been criticised in recent weeks for marrying a Muslim man before he divorced his wife, appeared on ITV’s Daybreak to argue there had been a change in how Muslims in England are treated in public since Drummer Rigby was killed.

The soldier and young father was returning to his barracks in South London last month when he was attacked by Muslim extremists.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, have both been charged with murder and remanded in custody.

In the aftermath of the killing, an Islamic centre in North London and an Islamic school in Kent were both targeted by arsonists in what police believe were suspected reprisals against Muslims.

Miss Booth, who appeared on television wearing a patterned hijab, said she had been treated kindly since converting two years ago.

Since the terror attack, however, the way women of her religion are viewed has changed, she claimed.

‘When I came to Islam two years ago and I first put on the scarf I was nervous about going on the Underground. I thought everyone is going to see me differently and everyone was beautiful towards me,’ she said.

‘I was invisible for a few weeks and 
then I noticed that British people were smiling. Same as we always do, 
we’re really good at that, we’re really good at absorbing and accepting 
people. But honestly, in the last two weeks I’ve been getting public 
transport and there are grown men looking like they want to hit Muslim 
women.

‘And I’m a tall, white woman. I’m not easily threatened but I have felt scared at times, so there is a change unfortunately.’

Miss Booth went on to criticise Mr 
Blair, who recently argued there was a ‘problem within Islam’, which had
 allowed the seeds of extremism to be sown.

Asked if he was right, she said: 
‘Absolutely not, and I think it’s very dangerous to take a summary of a 
religion from a man who’s overseen the invasion of several Muslim 
countries and overseen a war where a million people whom are Muslim have
 been killed and millions displaced.’

Earlier this month, Miss Booth was 
seen walking with her new husband Sohale Ahmed, 49, in Hampstead Garden 
Suburb, North London, where she lives in a £500,000 apartment with her 
two daughters.

Mr Ahmed’s wife of 16 years, Faiza, 
claims he is a bigamist, having married Miss Booth in a Muslim ceremony 
while keeping her as his legal wife according to UK law.

Despite the accusation, Miss Booth insisted since converting to Islam her life had been ‘peaceful’.

She said: ‘We say it’s a clean life…you’re more spiritual and calmer, and hopefully kinder with people.’

The idea Miss Booth would be intimidated on the Tube was ridiculed by viewers.

Nini, from London, wrote online: ‘Doubt it. Most Londoners don’t look at fellow travellers on  public transport.’
