Within the sandstone walls of Sydney's St Matthias Anglican Church, lies over 150 years of history.

But a property magnate has proposed that the site, structured in a gothic revival style, should be demolished to make way for a multi-storey carpark as 'St Matthias has ceased to function as a church'.

Max Raine, a former chairman of Raine and Horne, believes the church is 'under-used' and has 'much more potential'.

Reverend Peter Baker says St Matthias Church in Paddington, eastern Sydney's inner-city, is here to stay

The historic church was built on this very site in 1861 but its history dates back to 1885

However Reverend Peter Baker, assistant minister of the church, refutes these claims and says St Matthias has about 400 parishioners.

And the congregation continues to grow.

'Our cultural values of the church itself significantly outweighs the values of a carpark,' Rev Baker said.

'St Matthias has been a vibrant part of the community and our facilities are used regularly.'

And he says the Paddington church, in Sydney's inner-city eastern suburb, is here to stay.

'It's not for sale and we're not looking to move thank you very much,' Rev Baker said.

'But Mr Rains is more than welcome to our church. Our doors are open.'

Mr Raine, who's been in the property industry for about 60 years, says the double street frontage of the church makes it a perfect location for a multi-storey carpark.

'The site is being under-used and I know that from going there several times myself,' he said.

'It's sad to say but the church is under-used and it has so much more potential for even a hospital or a child-care centre.'

Mr Raine, an Anglican, says creating a multi-storey carpark will help activate the strip of shops on the street.

'There's not enough parking in the area and it needs to be created in order to attract more shoppers,' he said.

Church administrator Josh Crockett says activities for congregants are held at the church nearly every day of the week.

These include two services on Sundays, youth groups, marriage counselling, various women's groups and ESL classes.

St Matthias Anglican Church dates back to 1885 and was built in 1861.
