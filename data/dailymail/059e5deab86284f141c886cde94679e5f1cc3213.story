Sergio Aguero will miss Manchester City's first Champions League clash with Barcelona after being ruled out for a month with a hamstring injury.

It also means that City will be without their top scorer for Monday's top-of-the-table meeting with Chelsea at the Etihad, as well as the FA Cup fifth round tie between the two teams.

He will also be touch and go for the Capital One Cup final against Sunderland on March 2.

Aguero, who only returned from an 
eight-game lay-off with a calf strain earlier this month, damaged his 
right hamstring in Wednesday's win at Tottenham.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini said: 'The doctor has seen Aguero and he will be out for a month. It will be difficult because he is a top player for us but we have the players to replace him.

The game at White Hart Lane had been Aguero's fifth since returning from a month-long lay-off with a calf injury.

Yet with City having scored 115 goals in all competitions this term, Pellegrini is confident his team can overcome his absence.

'He
 has just come back from injury and Alvaro Negredo, Stevan Jovetic and 
Edin Dzeko can replace him. But, of course, he is a very important 
player for us.'
