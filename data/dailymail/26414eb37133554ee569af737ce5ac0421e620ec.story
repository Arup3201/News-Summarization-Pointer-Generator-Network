Greece have appointed youth coach Kostas Tsanas as their interim manager, but are yet to officially announce the sacking of former Chelsea boss Claudio Ranieri.  

The country's football federation (EPO) has effectively suspended Ranieri for the time being as both sides work out the financial settlement surrounding his €1.6million (£1.27m) contract.

Ranieri, 63, was expected to stay on for Greece's friendly with Serbia in Crete on Tuesday but that is no longer the case.

'The Hellenic Football Federation announces that the role of interim coach for the friendly match with Serbia with be Kostas Tsanas and Nektarios Pantazis,' EPO said in a brief media statement.

EPO chief Giorgos Sarris has made clear their intentions to part company with Ranieri on Saturday following the humiliating 1-0 defeat to the Faroe Islands which left Greece bottom of Euro 2016 qualifying Group F.

Ranieri was appointed after the 2014 World Cup, taking over from Portuguese boss Fernando Santos on a two-year deal amid enthusiastic media hype.

But the former Chelsea, Juventus and Monaco boss, has failed to live up to his billing, with the Greeks appearing to go backwards after the World Cup.

Greek media termed the national team's shock 1-0 home defeat by Faroe Islands as a 'black night' for football in the country.

Local media have linked former PAOK and AEK Athens boss Giorgos Donis and current PAOK manager Angelos Anastasiadis with the post.
