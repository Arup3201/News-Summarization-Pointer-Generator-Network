Accused: A witness said Michael Piggin, now 18, drew a large knife from his trenchcoat

A neo-Nazi accused of plotting a 'new Columbine' told a fellow pupil he kept a hit list of people he wanted to kill, a court heard today.

Michael Piggin was just 16 when he is alleged to have started planning the deadly attack on teachers and classmates at his former school in Loughborough, Leicestershire.

Today a college classmate told the jury Piggin hated foreign classmates because he thought they were all being paid benefits and 'wished we could kill them all'.

The Old Bailey heard the two boys were initially friends, but fell out when Piggin made a string of racist remarks at another college student, it is said.

'He hated a lot of the foreign people on the course, and he said he would kill all of them', the classmate told the jury.

'He said all of them were getting dole money, benefit money, and he wished we could kill them all - out of order comments.

'He always fantasised of killing people, and said he had a gun range at home with peoples' heads on it.

'He just said he had a list of people on there that he was going to kill.'

Piggin allegedly stockpiled knives, guns, homemade bombs and a crossbow on his bedroom floor, and kept a journal of his plans to commit mass murder.

He is accused of planning a Columbine-style massacre at his former school and wanting to attack the council offices, a local cinema, and Loughborough 
University.

The English Defence League supporter, now 18, bragged about getting a machete for his birthday and making bombs in his bedroom, the jury heard.

Today the classmate told the trial Piggin once pulled a large knife out of his trench coat pocket and told him 'look at this f***er'.

Two weeks later, he showed off three knives in class after the teacher left the room, it is alleged.

'It was quite a big knife, really long, and he had it in his pocket,' the classmate said.

Bedroom: The jury was shown a photograph of Piggin's room at his home in Loughborough with a Nazi flag

Preparation: The jury was previously shown footage of Michael Piggin, now 18, 'testing' a Molotov cocktail against a wall behind a leisure centre while his friends filmed him on a mobile phone

Flames: The Old Bailey saw him launch the homemade explosive, which was put together using a wine bottle

'It was a black knife, he put them all in his bag because the teacher came back into the classroom.

'There was another knife that he had in his boot.'

In another incident when the boys met in town, Piggin allegedly said he was going to make a bomb.

'He told me he was going to make a bomb when he got home and he didn't laugh like he was joking, he just said it,' the witness said.

He added Piggin fantasised about guns and committing mass murder.

'He said he had a gun on him at college and opened his bag', he said. 'Under his coat he had a gun shape. He said it is, but he didn't show me.

'I just saw what looks like an outline.'

Organisation: The accused teenager is said to have plotted a Columbine-style massacre in Loughborough

Graffiti: More footage showed the defendant allegedly spraying 'No more mosques' on the wall. Today a classmate told his trial that Piggin wanted to kill foreign classmates and thought they were all on benefits

He said Piggin claimed to carry the knives 'for protection' and boasted about having a shooting range at home.

He added: 'He says he likes shooting, and I think he said he had been shooting ducks with his dad.'

Piggin and two other 18-year-old boys, who cannot be named, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs.

However, Piggin maintained he was not planning a terrorist attack.

Piggin denies two charges: possessing articles for a 
purpose connected with terrorism, and possession of a document or a 
record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person 
committing or preparing an act of terrorism on or before 19 February 
2013.

The jury was previously shown footage of Piggin testing Molotov cocktails with his two friends behind a local leisure centre.

The trial was also shown online chats with his friends in which he idolised religious extremist Baruch Goldstein, who went on a killing spree in a mosque.

The online conversations from January 2013 were seized by police after his arrest in February last year.

The trial continues.
