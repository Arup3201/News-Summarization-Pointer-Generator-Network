Richard Kilty, the self-proclaimed ‘Teesside Tornado,’ is like a prizefighter trying to sell tickets to his next bout with a whirl of punchy declarations and threats to his rivals.

‘A few people have called me a one-hit wonder and counted me out,’ he said after backing up the World Indoor 60m title he won last year with the European equivalent in Prague. ‘I don’t think they should do that again. I’m a fearless warrior when I’m on the track, I come alive on the battlefield.’

He talks a good game but over the last 12 months has backed it up with performances. Victory in Poland last year over a host of American and Caribbean sprinters was a surprise, but he arrived in Prague as favourite and proved himself with a 6.51sec, 33-stride, dash in the final.

‘When I am in good physical shape I don’t think anyone can mentally break me,’ he said, ‘It’s my absolute dream and has been since I was a kid to stand on these start lines and compete. It’s just second nature for me so why should I be unnerved by it.’

Kilty got a good start and maintained his speed to the line to beat German duo Christian Blum and Julian Reus comfortably into the minor medals. 

It had been teed up as a battle of the Brits but Chijindu Ujah, who qualified second quickest for the final behind Kilty, was disqualified for a false start.

The 20-year-old became the fifth Briton to break the 10sec barrier over 100m last year with a time of 9.96sec surpassing anything Usain Bolt did at the same age. 

But he sat on the outfield head in hands as his compatriot raced to glory and was close to tears afterwards. 

‘I felt they were holding us in the blocks for too long,’ he said, ‘I’ve never false started in my life so for it to happen here I’m gutted. I thought I could’ve won.’

But Kilty, who is only the third man after Dwain Chambers and Jason Gardner to hold both the World and European titles at the same time, was in no doubt he would have come out on top.

‘I was looking forward to winning the race outright with no questions,’ he said, ‘I’m certain, 110 per cent, I was going to take the victory no matter what the circumstance.’

The British team’s chances of beating their best ever medal haul evaporated with Ujah’s qualification. The final tally of two gold, four silver and three bronze medals fell one short of the 10 won on home soil in Birmingham in 2007.

For Dina Asher-Smith it was the Crusades on Monday, the Renaissance on Tuesday and officially becoming the world’s fastest teenager in history over 60m on Sunday. 

‘It’s back to lectures in two days,’ said the 19-year-old, who studies history at King’s College London.

On International Women’s Day it was fitting she became the first British woman in 30 years, since Heather Oakes won bronze in Athens in 1985, to win a 60m medal. 

Her time of 7.08sec earned her the silver medal and equalled Jeanette Kwakye’s British record.

Asher-Smith' second place finish was fast enough to make her the fastest ever teenager over the distance

‘People were saying “You could break it or equal it” but there’s a difference between saying it and doing it,’ she said. ‘I’m really happy to get a PB in the final — that never happens to me.’

Asher-Smith is at the forefront of a group of talented British female sprinters including Jodie Williams, Bianca Williams and Ashleigh Nelson. But she was not letting her studies suffer, completing an essay on The Return of Martin Guerre by Natalie Zemon Davis before turning her attention to the track. 

A celebratory pizza with room-mate Morgan Lake, who broke the British junior pentathlon record on Friday, was on the cards. ‘She’s been holding out for the whole champs,’ said Asher-Smith, ‘she hasn’t got a Domino’s to tease me yet.’

The women’s 4x400m team executed a remarkable comeback to win silver. They were in sixth place after Kelly Massey’s first leg but Seren Bundy-Davies demonstrated her powers of recovery with a rapid second leg to move them into fourth. Laura Maddox consolidated their position and Kirsten McAslan ran a storming anchor leg to cross the line in 3:31.79, just behind France.

The men’s 4x400m squandered any chance of a medal after a disastrous handover from Conrad Williams to Jamie Bowie on the first leg.

In a thrilling 1500m final, Chris O’Hare strained every sinew to hold off Germany’s Homiyu Tesfaye in the dying metres and clinch bronze in a season’s-best time of 3:38.96. 

The Scot executed his challenge perfectly, positioning himself on the shoulder of home favourite and eventual winner Jakub Holusa.

A nasty cut on his heel did not dampen O’Hare’s delight. ‘In the first five metres I got stood on from behind,’ he said. ‘I thought “That’s not handy” but I’ll get some stitches and I’ll be all right.’
