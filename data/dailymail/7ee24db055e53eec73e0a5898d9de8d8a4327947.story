Deepest sympathy: Iraqi President Fuad Masum sent a letter of condolences to the Foley family in reaction to the beheading of their son James

Iraqi President Fuad Masum today sent a letter to the family of American journalist James Foley beheaded by ISIS fanatics, expressing his condolences.

Masum has become the first Iraqi official to contact the Foleys since the gruesome video of the desert execution was released by the Islamist militants earlier this week.

Masum, who assumed office a month ago, called Foley's slaying a 'bloodthirsty act' in his three-paragraph note written in Arabic.

The newly elected Iraqi leader railed against the ISIS rebels, calling them 'terrorists' who do not care about the ‘dignity of humanity.’

Mr Masum added that horrific crime committed by ISIS against Foley highlighted the need to boost 'the freedom of journalists, guarding their rights to work, and securing the delivery of their news to the audience.'

Iraq's president concluded his heartfelt letter to the Foley family by saying that he is feeling the ‘deep pain’ experienced by James’ relatives, colleagues, friends, and 'all those of appreciate life.'

President Masum's letter, first reported on and translated by NBC News, came a day after James Foley's brother, Michael, gave an emotional interview expressing his anger that US government did not do more to help free his older sibling.

Speaking from Dover, New Hampshire, with his sister, Katie, seated by his side, the 38-year-old Mr Foley said he believes the United States let his murdered brother down and said that negotiating with terrorists should be considered, despite the White House refusing to.

Unthinkable: The parents of beheaded American journalist James Foley have revealed that they watched the revolting video depicting their son's execution

Initially hesitant to discuss the controversial issues, Michael Foley said he felt the US did not do everything in its power to save his brother and said watching his fellow hostages return home after European countries paid their ransoms was hard to bear.

Michael Foley also appeared ambivalent about the Obama administrations much trumpeted 'flawless' July 4 rescue mission for the captive reporter, which failed when it raided the wrong base, and of which the Foleys were not informed.

Michael called on the United States to work with Europe to establish a coherent strategy for dealing with terrorists, because as it stands, terrorists know they will get no ransom for their American prisoners.

'I really really hope that in some way Jim's death pushes us to take another look at our approach, our policy to terrorist and hostage negotiations and rethink that,' said Michael.

'Because if the United States is doing it one way and Europe is doing it another way then by definition it won’t work.'

The anger aimed at the White House was compounded by the desperate revelation that the Foley family have watched their son's execution video.

Asked outside their home in Rochester, New Hampshire, dad John Foley said, 'We just needed to know.'

Family reacts: Katie and Michael Foley spoke exclusively to Katie Couric Friday, expressing frustration that the US did not do more to save their brother 

Unable to speak any more about the horrifying clip, incredibly the Foleys claimed that they will one day forgive their sons killers.

‘Not today'.....but said John, 'As a Christian, we have to.'

In an interview earlier Friday morning on the Today show, James Foley's parents said that they were not going to remain silent on the issue of negotiation and said that the process was 'very uneven'.

James Foley, 40, was kidnapped on Thanksgiving 2012 and on Tuesday, ISIS released a shockingly barbaric video of his beheading, which sent ripples of disgust across the world.

Foley's executioner appeared to have a British accent and the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, has said he is sure the butcher is a British citizen.

At the end of the revolting execution video, another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, is paraded in front of the camera and threatened with death unless the United States ceases bombing ISIS positions in northern Iraq.

During their appearance on the Today show Friday morning, James Foley's father revealed that he underestimated the brutality of ISIS after receiving an email last week that gave the family hope they could negotiate with the captors for their son's life.

Michael and Katie Foley said they hope the release of Sotloff can be secured and revealed the horrifying email sent to them on August 12 by their brother's kidnappers.

'It was chilling. It was full of so much hate,' said Katie Foley. 'I don't understand where that much hate can come from in a person.

Michael also confirmed that he was sent an email by his brother's captors demanding $132million dollars, a sum he called 'ridiculous'.

Besides Iraq’s newly elected president, the Foley clan were also contacted by Pope Francis, who called them Friday to express his condolences and offer his prayers.

Michael said that the pontiff labeled James a martyr whose sacrifice would not be forgotten.

Marveling at the leader of the Catholic Church phoning their home, Katie said that the experience was full of grace.

'It was pretty powerful, it felt like the Lord and Jim were watching down on us at the same time and kind of giving us the strength to move forward,' said Katie.
