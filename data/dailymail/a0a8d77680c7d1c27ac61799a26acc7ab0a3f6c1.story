Joan Mondale, the wife of former Vice President Walter Mondale, has died three days after entering a hospice care program at the age of 83.

The coupleâ€™s longtime church released a statement announcing her move to end-of-life care on Friday, giving very few details about her condition.

She entered the unidentified facility and the illness that led to her death has not been revealed.

Back in the day: Joan Mondale, seen with her husband Walter at the Democratic National Convention in 1980, died Monday evening at the age of 83

'She is surrounded by her family and loved ones as her life on this earth moves peacefully to its close,' the statement announcing her move to hospice care read.

'Joan of Art': The former Second Lady was known for her work to increase arts appreciation

The statement was released by Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis, where the Mondales have been members for decades.

Mrs Mondale, who was born in Eugene, Oregon and whose maiden name was Adams, worked at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts after graduating from college and met her future husband on a blind date that had been arranged through one of his law school classmates.

The couple married in 1955 and had three children, one of whom died in 2011 following a battle with brain cancer.

She built a reputation as a national cultural arts advocate while her husband was vice president, and was so passionate about the arts that she was nicknamed â€˜Joan of Art.â€™

She herself was an avid potter when Walter Mondale was elected Jimmy Carter's vice president in 1976.

During the Carter administration, from 1977 to 1981, she used her status to help cultivate a collection of American art that was stored at the vice Presidential mansion.

When Walter tried and failed to win the presidency in 1984, the couple moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota and then later moved to Japan when he was appointed as the U.S. Ambassador.

They lived in Japan from 1993 to 1996 and she took the chance to redecorate the American embassy during that time, filling it with American art and promoting better understanding between the two nations.

They returned to Minnesota following the posting, and she has continued her work with the arts in her home state.
