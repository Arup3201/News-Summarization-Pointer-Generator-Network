The Reverend Jesse Jackson has been arrested for criminal trespass after protesting on the site of an Illinois factory which is moving its operations to China, it emerged today.

Jackson was taken into custody with about a dozen workers yesterday for an alleged act of civil disobedience in Freeport, said a spokesman for the preacher's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.

The Baptist minister marched onto property at Sensata Techonologies over the company's decision to relocate its manufacturing to the Far East.

He said: 'This is the essence of the American struggle. The fight to keep our jobs.

'This is not a fight for severance pay; it's a fight for the salvation of our jobs. There is a war going on today for the soul of our nation.'

The move by Sensata, which manufactures and sells sensors and controls for auto companies, will cost 170 jobs.

Jackson was taken along with the others arrested to Freeport Fire Station, where they were processed.

Afterwards, he was just as defiant.

'Now, youâ€™re looking at an economic terrorism,' he told www.journalstandard.com.

'The plant has taken jobs away to China. 
They expect on November 5, the day before the election, to close the 
plant. You vote in a democracy to be protected from terrorism.'

He said the protests will continue next week with greater numbers.

Company officials say most of the plant's revenues are generated in Asia, making the move a logical decision.

Freeport police didn't immediately have comment.

A
number of other high-profile supporters have also visited the workers, 
including the Rev Al Sharpton, who recently held a rally in Freeport.

Jackson's son, congressman Jesse Jackson Jr, is currently facing an FBI criminal probe amid claims that 
he misused campaign funds to decorate his own home and he may be 
indicted before he comes up for re-election next month.

The 47-year-old has rarely been seen in public since he took a leave of absence from Congress in June.

His father, 71, founded the organisations that merged to form the Rainbow/ PUSH coalition.

The Baptist minister became involved 
in the civil rights movement while an undergraduate and went to Selma, 
Alabama, to march with Martin Luther King in 1965.

He was twice a candidate for the 
Democratic presidential nomination in the 1980s and served as shadow 
U.S. Senator for the District of Columbia from 1991 to 1997.

He was awarded the 2000 Presidential Medal of Freedom after being appointed special envoy to Africa.
