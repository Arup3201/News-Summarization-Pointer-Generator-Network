Zafer Eren, a leading member of the 'Tottenham Turks', who was gunned down on his doorstep in Southgate, north London 

A gang member started plotting the contract killing of a rival gangster just days after the end of a murder trial as part of a long running fued, a court has heard

Beytullah Gunduz, 28, recruited one of the assassins for the hit on 34-year-old Zafer Eren, a leading member of the 'Tottenham Turks', on his doorstep in Southgate, north London.

Mr Eren was allegedly gunned down in revenge for the killing of Ali Armagan, a leading member of the rival 'Hackney Turks'.

The trial in the suspects in the Armagan murder, which revealed that a member of the Eren family was responsible, ended at the Old Bailey in March 2013.

Today, the Old Bailey heard how two days after the end of the trial, Gunduz contacted one of the hired hands involved in the hit on Zafer Eren.

Prosecutor Ed Brown QC told the jury: 'The Crown say that this defendant was part of the planning for that killing, knowing what was afoot.

'He may not have known the precise time and date the killing would take place but he knowingly took part in the planning of the murder, the recruitment and at least one of the murders.'

The court heard how the murder of Mr Eren was the latest chapter in a 'violent feud' between the two rival north London gangs, headed by the Eren and Armagan families.

Mr Brown explained that the feud began in March 2009 when Ali Armagan's brother Kemal Armagan was beaten up at the Manor Club in Manor House.

He said: 'He vowed to exact revenge and over the next few years there were a series of attacks, escalating to the use of guns and ultimately to murder and attempted murder.'

In March 2009 innocent shopkeeper Ahmet Paytak, 50, was shot dead at Euro Food and Wines in Hornsey Road, Holloway, by a hitman hired by the Hackney Turks.

On October 2, 2009, Tottenham Turk member Oktay Erbasli, was shot and killed while driving in Tottenham.

Three days later the Tottenham Turks took revenge with the shooting of 21 year-old Cem Duzgun at a social club frequented by Hackney Turk members in Upper Clapton Road.

The feud continued with the murder of 32 year-old Ali Armagan, 32, near Turnpike Lane tube station on February 1, 2012.

Gunduz was allegedly present during one incident when a Hackney Turk was shot through the hand at a shop.

Then on the evening of December 30, 2012, Zafer's cousin, 34 year-old Inan Eren, was shot in the arm, stomach and buttock on his own doorstep but survived.

The trial of suspects charged with the murder of Ali Armagan began in February 2013, the court heard.

Mr Brown added: 'It was during the trial that it became clear it was Kemal Eren who had been directly responsible.

'Two days after that trial had finished, on March 7, this defendant, who was associated with the Hackney Turks, contacted Samuel Zerei, who ultimately was to take a direct part in the killing of Zafer Eren.'

Gunduz was also involved in sourcing a car for the hired killers although it was never used, the court heard.

Jurors heard the hitman, Jamie Marsh-Smith, 22, and the getaway driver Samuel Zerei, 21, have both been found guilty of the murder of Zafer Eren.

At 7.20pm on April 18, 2013, Zafar Eren was shot as he walked through the security gates to his home at Fontaine Court off Southgate High Street in North London.

Marsh-Smith fired seven shots from the pavement, three of which struck Mr Eren in the back, before escaping in the back of a burgundy Peugeot 308 driven by Zerei.

Mr Brown said: 'The killing of Zafer Eren would not have occurred had it not been for that feud between these two warring parties. It was not a random killing, it was ordered and organised.

'It is clear that hired hands were brought in to carry out the killing itself, willing to do the rival gang's dirty work for them.'

Marsh-Smith, of Manor House, north London, and Zerei, of Newington Green, north London, were both convicted of murder.

Gunduz, of Finsbury Park, denies conspiracy to murder.

The trial continues.
