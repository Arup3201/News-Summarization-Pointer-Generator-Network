Public hospitals in Brisbane and Hobart have the longest waiting lists for bowel cancer surgery in the country, a new report shows. 

And patients suffering bowel cancer wait longer  to receive surgery than those with breast or lung cancer, according to research by the National Health Performance Authority (NHPA) released on Thursday.

Of 4362 surgeries for malignant bowel cancer across 89  large Australian public hospitals, 82 treated at least 90 per cent of their patients within 45 days.

Patients at Princess Alexandra Hospital (above) in Brisbane  experienced the equal longest waits for bowel cancer surgery.

Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane and the Royal Hobart Hospital had the longest waiting times for bowel cancer surgery, taking between 76 and 90 days to reach the 90 per cent completion rate. 

Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred and Royal Perth hospitals also had longer waits, taking 46 to 60 days to reach the same rate.

The NHPA researched surgery waiting times at Australian public hospitals for three common cancers for which surgery is an important part of treatment: malignant bowel, breast and lung cancer.

Royal Hobart Hospital (above) patients experienced the equal longest waits for bowel surgery, according to a new report.

Using figures for 2012-13, the report lists the number of days between a patient's placement on a waiting list and the day they are admitted for surgery.

Urgent cancer cases are expected to be completed within 30 days, while semi-urgent cases are meant to be completed within 45 days.

The report found 96 per cent of breast cancer patients and 90 per cent of lung cancer patients received their surgery within 30 days. That figure dropped to 88 per cent for bowel cancer.

Bowel Cancer Australia chief executive Julien Wiggins said bowel cancer patients had a five-year survival rate of 66 per cent, compared with 89 per cent for breast cancer patients.

About 15,000 Australians are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year and about 4000 patients will die from the disease. 

Bowel cancer patients at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (above) in Sydney faced longer waits for surgery than in most other large Australian public hospitals.

Mr Wiggins said it was good news that most bowel cancer patients received surgery within a month of being placed on a waiting list. 'Unfortunately, the data also shows that 216 bowel cancer patients did not receive timely surgery,' he said.

'They remained on the public hospital waiting lists for longer than 45 days.'

Overall, 92 per cent of cancer patients were treated within 30 days and almost all - 97 per cent - had their operations within 45 days. 

Mr Wiggins said time on a hospital waiting list was only one component of cancer care.

'We need to find improvements at every stage of the cancer journey from earlier diagnosis, to timely surgery, more treatment options and better supportive care,' he said.

AMA vice-president, Dr Stephen Parnis, was pleased cancer patients continued to be prioritised as requiring urgent elective surgery.

'But it's important to acknowledge that there are non-cancer elective cases that are also life threatening that also require prioritisation and resources,' Dr Parnis said.

'That's not in any way undermining the need for cancer support services but we have to remember that there's more than cancer that threatens the lives of Australians.'
