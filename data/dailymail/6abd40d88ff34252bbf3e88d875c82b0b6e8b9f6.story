For Bella Hosford, dealing with the loss of her beloved great grandma did not come easy.

Minnie Sue Watts died in August 2012, and the little girl, from Chapel Hill, Tennessee, misses her each day.

'I really do miss her, because she was my favoritest grandmother ever,' Bella said.

'The last day I got to see her, it was a really special day to me, because I knew that she was going to go to Heaven,' Bella said.

'When I hugged her, the last thing she ever said to me was, ''I love you, Bella''.'

Recently, Bella decided she needed to send a message to Heaven, according to KLTV.

Touched by an angel: When Bella Hosford, from Chapel Hill in Tennessee, sent a balloon to heaven with a message for her late great-grandma, she never anticipated what she would get in return

With the help of her mom, Tricia Hosford, they got a helium balloon and attached a note to it on pink saying: 'Tell Mawmaw I love and to come visit soon. Love Bella.'

Months passed, but then on Monday a mysterious package arrived in the mail to their home in Chapel Hill, a rural Marshal County town of only about 1000 people.

It was a box wrapped in brown paper, along with the broken balloon and Bella's pink note.

Inside the box was a beautiful silver locket.

And on the back on the original note read the message: 'Dearest Bella. Mawmaw is always with you. Just close your eyes and you will see her. Love, your guardian angel.'

The package: On Monday: Bella Hosford and her mother Tricia found quite a surprise in their mailbox - Bella's letter and balloon, along with a new note and a gift-wrapped box

Prized possession: Inside the box was this silver locket, which must have been sent by a Good Samaritan who found the balloon and its message

Gobsmacked: Bella and Tricia Hosford said they sat on their driveway for 'five, ten minutes' and 'cried and embraced and absorbed the moment'

Both mother and daughter were completely floored.

'We stood at the end of the driveway for probably five, 10 minutes, just crying and embracing and just absorbing the moment,' Tricia said.

The pair have no idea who sent the poignant package.

'It was a very selfless act, especially at this time of the year, that is worth volumes,' Tricia Hosford said.

'I have no idea. No idea. It's priceless.'

The Hosford family live in a small farming town in Tennessee called Chapel Hill, with a population of only about 1000, which only adds to the intrigue of how someone managed to find the balloon

Bella said she initially couldn't consider it to be from anyone 'but mawmaw', but her mom has explained it to her.

'If I knew who that person was, I would walk up to them and hug them on their neck and tell them thank you,' Bella said, adding that the locket is now her most prized possession.Â
