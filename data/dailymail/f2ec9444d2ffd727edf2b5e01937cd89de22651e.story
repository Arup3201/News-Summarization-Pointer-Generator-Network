Hollywood actor Gregory Walcott, the star of Plan 9 From Outer Space which was described as the 'worst movie ever made' - has died aged 87.

Walcott worked with some of the giants of the acting world including Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg in a career which spanned four decades.

But the celebrated actor, who died on Friday of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles, never felt he could shake the tag of appearing in Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space.

Hollywood actor Gregory Walcott, who was the star of the film panned as the worst movie ever - Plan 9 from Outer Space (pictured) - has died aged 87

During an interview in 1998 with Filmfax magazine, he said the director had 'etched his name forever in the annals of film history.'

'I will go to my grave not remembered for those meaty roles I did for the likes of John Ford or Steven Spielberg, but as the leading man in a film that many movie historians regard as the worst of all time. It's enough to drive a puritan to drink!'

Walcott said the director had 'etched his name forever in the annals of film history.'

The science fiction cult classic was panned by critics when it came out in 1959 and was widely regarded as one of the worst films ever made.

Writer and director Wood cut unused footage of Bela Lugosi after the horror legend died. He then used his wife's chiropractor as a stand in for other scenes using a cape to hide his face- despite his being nearly bald and significantly taller than the deceased actor.

The low-budget film also featured poor special effects such as flying saucers dangling from visible strings, ropey sets and laughable dialogue.

Walcott had refused the role of alien-fighting pilot Jeff Trent at first, describing the script as 'gibberish.'

But he was later persuaded that his name could add a little credibility to the film and agreed to star- without his agent's knowledge.

It was a decision that came back to haunt him as he was consigned to the annals of film history for that very role.

Walcott later went on to win critical acclaim in The Outsider, playing a drill instructor across from Tony Curtis's Ira Hayes, the Native American Second World War hero.

It's star may have believed it was the worst film ever made, but Plan 9 From Outer Space only rated as number 16 in Empire's 50 worst films of all time.

1) Batman and Robin (1997)

2)  Battlefield Earth (2000)

3) The Love Guru (2008) 

4) Raise the Titanic (1980)

5) Epic movie (2007)

6) Heaven's gate (1980) 

7) Sex Lives of the Potato Men (2004) 

8) The Happening (2008 )

9) Highlander 2: The Quickening (1991) 

10) The Room (2003) 

He also starred in several Clint Eastwood films including Joe Kidd and Every Which Way But Loose and appeared in Steven Speilberg's directorial debut The Sugarland Express in 1974.

And Plan 9 From Outer Space was linked closely with the actor's final film in Tim Burton's 1994 biopic of its director Ed Wood where Walcott appeared in a cameo part.

He told the LA Times in 2000: 'I didn't want to be remembered for (Plan 9). But it's better to be remembered for something than for nothing, don't you think?' 

The actor is survived by his son Todd Mattox and his daughters Jina and Pam, as well as several grandchildren. 

Mr Mattox, a puppeteer on the Men in Black films, paid tribute to his father on his Facebook page where he posted: 'We said goodbye to my dad today. He spent his life making people feel good. Gregory Walcott, 1928-2015.'
