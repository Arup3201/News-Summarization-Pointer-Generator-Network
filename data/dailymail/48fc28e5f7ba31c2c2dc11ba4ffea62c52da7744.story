A British soldier has been sent home from Afghanistan and faces disciplinary action after filming a foul-mouthed rap criticising the government and posting it on the internet.

Olly Carpenter, 25, of the Royal Engineers, uploaded the two-minute clip – in which he says ‘half of this Government needs to be quarantined’ and the country is ‘run by p***ks’ – to his Facebook page earlier this month and the video went viral. 

An MoD spokeswoman said: ‘All Service personnel are expected to uphold the strict values of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. 

'Anyone found to not be compliant can expect to face appropriate action.’
