Police are hunting vandals who ripped down a sapling tree commemorating fallen British soldiers - so they could use its branches to play 'fetch' with their Pitbull terrier.

The thugs, who appeared to be drunk, were walking the animal at 8am on July 21 when they pulled up the one-year-old Dove tree from a flower bed before tearing it apart and throwing it around.

A warden on duty at the Memorial Park in Fleetwood, Lancashire, tried to intervene but he was surrounded by the four men and told to 'f*** off'.

The tree was planted in Memorial Park in Fleetwood, Lancashire, as a tribute to soldiers killed in Afghanistan

Desecrated: The destroyed tree was planted in this flowerbed just a year ago

The vandals ran off when police arrived on the scene.

A park workman said:  'They’d obviously taken something because we understand they appeared to be very drunk.

'One
of the groundsman tried to intervene as they pulled the tree up and 
told them off saying how much effort had been put into making the 
gardens look nice.'

Today Lancashire Police condemned the yobs for what they called 'mindless vandalism' and urged locals to turn them in.

PC Scott McLaren who is investigating
the damage said: 'It would appear that, in a mindless act of vandalism,
someone has pulled the branches from the tree before breaking off the 
remainder of the trunk, completely destroying it.

'If anyone does have any information about what happened then I would urge them to contact us.'

The tree - sometimes known as the 'Handkerchief Tree' - was planted last year in memory of soldiers who were killed in Afghanistan.

The park in Fleetwood, Lancashire, was turned into a memorial in 1917 for those who lost their lives in the First World War

It was placed near a memorial to Royal Marine Darren Smith, 27, from Fleetwood, who was shot dead in an ambush by the Taliban in Helmand Province on Valentine's Day 2009.

In 1917 the park was turned into a memorial to those who had died during the First World War.

Local councillor Roger Berry of Wyre Council which runs the park said: “I am saddened that over the weekend damage was caused to the rose garden at Memorial Park.

'We have restored the garden and are assisting the police with their inquiries. A memorial Handkerchief tree was unfortunately damaged beyond repair however we intend to plant a replacement in winter.

'We will not allow the actions of a minority to spoil a garden that is enjoyed by so many nor let them dent the community spirit of Memorial Park.

'If anyone has any information about this incident I urge them to contact the police.'
