As she finally leaves hospital after two months of painful recovery to begin her rehabilitation treatment, flesh-eating victim Aimee Copeland puts on a brave face and smiles for the camera as she is wheeled out by a medic.

The 24-year-old was released from Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia, today two months after contracting the deadly disease when she fell from a broken zip-line.

She'll spend the next several weeks in a rehabilitation clinic learning to move with the aid of a wheelchair after having her left leg, right foot and both hands amputated.

Holding a doll with one of her amputated limbs and with what looked like a thermometer in her mouth, Aimee seemed happy and comfortable to pose with one of the medics who were there to transport her from hospital to the clinic.

Copeland's speedy recovery has defied 
doctors' initial prognosis. Her father says they at first gave her just a
slim chance of surviving. She spent weeks sedated and using a 
respirator while undergoing amputations and skin grafts to replace 
infected skin

Her father Andy spoke to msnbc about how momentous an occasion it was for Aimee to leave hospital.

'I think you could say that she's looking forward to it to the same degree that a child would look forward to leaving high school and going off to college, for her this is a major milestone.

'I would consider it a rite of passage for her as it is the opportunity that she has to actually venture out and relearn her life skills and be able to resume as normal a life as she can have.

'I believe her life can be extremely normal, whatever that word actually means. I think physically she's actually progressed rapidly, certainly far ahead of the doctor's schedule, what they thought she would do.

'I would say spiritually, mentally, psychologically she is so strong right now and for her, to actually be able to grasp the concept that she's lost her hands and feels blessed over that is an amazing thing.'

He also revealed they are in the process of making the house 'Aimee friendly' and building an extension onto it to be able to meet her needs.

The 24-year-old developed necrotizing fasciitis in a small cut she suffered after falling from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river.

Mr Copeland wrote on his blog last week that when aimee and her family ventured outside for the first time since the accident, they reflected on the life-changing events - and Aimee showed breathtaking courage.

'I don’t have any regrets about what has happened,' Aimee told her father. 'I don’t focus on what I’ve lost, I would rather focus on what I’ve gained. I feel like I’ve been blessed.'

She went on: 'I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience something that not many other people have the chance to experience.

Upbeat: On a blog, Aimee's father has said he is amazed by her courage and determination to walk

'I am blessed to have the capacity to 
share my experience with others and have a chance to improve the quality
of someone else's life. I’m blessed to be different.'

Speaking to GMA, her father spoke of her determination to walk at her Master's graduation ceremony this December. 'You heard the word right,' he said. 'Walk. That's what she intends to do.'

Earlier this month, Mr Copeland said his daughter had been enduring the worst pain of the ordeal. Her agony was so overwhelming that she began taking morphine after initially refusing medication.

The
student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her 
convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in 
holistic medicine.

She also suffered phantom pains. Mr Copeland wrote: 'Although she has no hands, her brain
is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there.

'I asked 
her if she could describe the pain and she told me, "It feels like I 
have been carrying bags of rocks".'

The
University of West Georgia student had to have multiple amputations to save her life 
after the small cut to her leg became infected.

The bacteria that attacked her wound released a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer
of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father said.

Aimee has 
improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and 
well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up 
for his brave daughter.

Mr
Copeland wrote that support Aimee has come from all over the US, including from celebrities like Sophia Vergara, Katie Couric and 
Ann Curry.

Less than a month ago, doctors gave her
little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite 
several major operations, but she is likely to remain hospitalised for several more months.

'This
doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' 
Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely
amazed.'

Necrotizing
fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but
extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to 
something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy 
skin, muscles and fat.

The
disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a 
minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that 
kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms
include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading 
bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock 
are also common complications.

Sufferers
must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given 
powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can 
become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.

There are 500 to 1,500 cases reported a year, but 20 to 25 percent of victims die.
