You can now see what weird and wonderful videos are being watched right now by people across the United States.

YouTube's new trend map can even filter by cities, age ranges and gender - and tell you  whether a video is being shared a lot, or viewed a lot.

When you hover over a thumbnail on the YouTube Trends map you can see the top two most popular videos for that location.

Click on the map below to see the top trending videos in real time

The YouTube Trends map shows which videos are currently being watched by people across the United States. You can filter by city, age, gender and by the amount of shares, or views a video is getting

The YouTube Trends map is based on information from the Dashboard.

Go to the Map and click Dashboard on the menu along the top of the screen.

In Browse mode, the Dashboard can be filtered by countries other than the US.

It can also filter videos by age and gender but only shows a grid of the ten most popular videos.

If you want to compare viewing habits from different countries, age groups or sexes, click Compare.

You can compare up to three different kinds of data.

The top ten videos then appear below.

You can then see how many views it has had in that area, as well as click the link to open it in a pop-up window.

The top 21 videos trending across the whole of America is shown on the right-side, ordered by how many regions are watching that specific clip.

YouTube's algorithm will also look for similar, or identical videos uploaded by different people.

The views and shares are collected and displayed in real-time.

Although, YouTube has said it can take up to 48 hours for videos to appear with age or gender breakdowns.

The age and gender data on a video’s audience is based on the information taken by registered YouTube users who are logged into their accounts.

When you hover your mouse over a thumbnail on the YouTube trends map you can see the top two most popular videos in that region. It also shows how many other regions that video is popular in. Click the link in the pop-up to watch the video. A list of videos on the right of the map shows the most popular videos across the country

Not all cities are listed because 
YouTube only uses regions that are 'large enough to consistently return 
results with some reliability.'

YouTube has said is does not track usernames, or release personal information about viewing habits.

At the moment, YouTube's Trends map only collects and displays data from the US.

Google has not announced when it will
be available in other regions, but has said to 'stay tuned for future 
updates and explorations'.
