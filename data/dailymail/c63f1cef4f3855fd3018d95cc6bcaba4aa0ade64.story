Health experts today hit back at Lord Tebbit's claims 'stupid' get fat by eating 'rubbish', insisting obesity is not caused by bad decisions.

The former Tory party chairman yesterday claimed fat people have only themselves to blame for their weight if they insist on ‘stuffing themselves silly’.

But the National Obesity Forum and the College of Contemporary Health insisted obesity is a 'complex problem' which is not going to be solved by 'lambasting and stigmatising people'.

Complex: Health experts insisted that tackling weight problems was more complicated than just telling people not to eat junk food

Scientists say that by 2050, half of 
women, almost two-thirds of men and a quarter of children will be obese.
 But earlier this week the National Obesity Forum said these predictions
 were ‘optimistic’ and underestimated the ‘true scale of the problem’.

But Lord Tebbit was cheered in the House of Lords as he said: ‘People ought to know that if they stuff themselves silly 
with high-calorie rubbish foods, they will get fat.

‘It’s
 their responsibility and all the forums and other nonsenses are merely 
trying to divorce  people from the consequences of their own stupid 
actions.’

Health Minister Earl Howe appeared to 
agree with him. He said: ‘You are absolutely right to place your finger 
on this central point – that it is in the end up to individuals 
themselves to take responsibility for their own state of health.’

But the remarks were condemned by 
health experts.

Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said:
 'I am outraged by Lord Tebbit’s comments. Claiming that obesity is 
caused by people stuffing their faces is nothing more than an insulting 
slur towards people who in many cases have serious health problems.

'The issue of obesity is not going to be solved by lambasting and stigmatising people.'

John Feenie, executive chairman of the College of Contemporary Health, said he was 'simply shocked' by Lord Tebbit’s comments.

'Of
 course the public needs to be encouraged and given the information to 
make healthy choices, but obesity is not the product of people’s inertia
 or poor decision making. It is a far more complex problem.'

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week called for ‘some real national soul-searching’ about how the UK can ‘grip this problem’.’

The NHS has warned that the statistics 
paint ‘an alarming picture that reveals that the obesity epidemic in 
England shows no signs of abating anytime soon’.

A
 national obesity forum report yesterday suggested forecasts that half 
the UK population will be obese by 2050 may ‘underestimate’ the problem.

People had to stop eating 'rubbish' and understand the consequences of their 'own stupid actions', Lord Tebbit added

Dr
 Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist at Croydon University Hospitals, South 
London, said obesity was ‘the greatest threat to health worldwide’.

He
 said poor diet was contributing to more disease than physical 
inactivity, smoking and alcohol combined, and accused junk food firms of
 adopting strategies of ‘denial’ and trying to confuse the public to 
ensure they carried on buying unhealthy products.

Dr
 Malhotra said the companies were using the same tactics as those used 
by the tobacco industry 50 years ago when evidence first emerged that 
smoking caused lung cancer.

‘Junk
 food companies sponsor sporting events and athletes endorse sugary 
drinks, with advertising that targets the most vulnerable members of 
society, including children,’ he said.
