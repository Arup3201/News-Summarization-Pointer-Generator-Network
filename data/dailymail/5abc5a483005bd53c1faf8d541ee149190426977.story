Ed Miliband has accepted a £110,000 donation from a tycoon who took him to a football match in a Rolls-Royce.

Businessman Assem Allam, 75, who owns Premier League side Hull City, handed over the six-figure sum two years after controversy over the Labour leader’s attendance at the game.

Mr Miliband appeared in the chairman’s seats for the afternoon match against Ipswich Town despite having earlier said he was too ill to attend a rally against government health reforms in the morning. The match ended in a two-all draw.

Egyptian-born Dr Allam, who is known as the ‘Pharaoh of Hull’, has angered fans of the club by attempting to rebrand it as Hull Tigers.

The latest Electoral Commission figures reveal Dr Allam donated £110,000 to the Labour Party in June this year. He previously donated £100,000 just weeks before Mr Miliband’s visit in March 2012.

The Labour leader arrived at the KC Stadium in a Rolls-Royce Phantom provided by his host for his surprise visit to Hull City, who at the time played in the Championship. Party officials had earlier claimed he was travelling to Hull to attend an anti-NHS reforms rally in the city centre. The official version of events is that the protest was called off because he was ill, but that he then quickly recovered.

Dr Allam is worth £320million, according to The Sunday Times Rich List. A former auditor in the Egyptian finance ministry, he settled in Britain more than 40 years ago

Dr Allam is worth £320million, according to The Sunday Times Rich List. A former auditor in the Egyptian finance ministry, he settled in Britain more than 40 years ago. He was forced to flee Egypt after being imprisoned and tortured on the orders of President Nasser.

Dr Allam got a job with Charterhouse, a London merchant bank, and when it sold one of its loss-making companies, a diesel generator manufacturer, in 1981, he bought it for £1.

He built the engineering business into one of the country’s most successful and profitable companies.

When Hull City’s proposed name change to Hull Tigers was announced last year it was claimed it would make the team more marketable in Asia, where football is growing in popularity.

But fans set up a campaign group called City Till We Die and protested during games. Dr Allam labelled them ‘hooligans’. The Football Association rejected the name change.

Dr Allam has had a number of disputes with Hull’s Labour-controlled council over property developments he has proposed in the city.

He wanted to buy the freehold of the stadium where his team plays from the authority, but it refused.

The city council also refused planning permission for him to convert a former factory into apartments and build new houses.

The latest Electoral Commission figures show Dr Allam donated £15,000 to the Conservative Middle East Association in May.
