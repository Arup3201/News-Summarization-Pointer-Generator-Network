Couple: JK Rowling and her husband Neil Murray at the Odeon Leicester Square in London in 2009

She is worth £560million and is behind one of the world’s most successful book and film series.

But JK Rowling - who has daughters Jessica, 20, and Mackenzie, eight, and son David, ten - insisted today that she is prouder of her years as a single mother than any other part of her life.

The 48-year-old Harry Potter author, who married Neil, 42, in 2001, said that Jessica - who she had with first husband Jorge - recently told her of the first five years of her life: ‘I never knew we were poor. I just remember being happy.’

The author - whose real name is Joanne Rowling - separated from Jorge 20 years ago, and said when she was a single mother with Jessica she would work a few hours a week at a local church.

Miss Rowling, writing on the website of single-parent charity Gingerbread, said:  ‘It was slowly dawning on me that I was now defined, in the eyes of many, by something I had never chosen.

‘I was a “single parent”, and a “single parent on benefits” to boot. Patronage was almost as hard to bear as stigmatisation.’ She said one woman even referred to her as ‘the unmarried mother’.

Miss Rowling added there were 'assumptions made about your morals, your motives for bringing your child into the world or your fitness to raise that child cut to the core of who you are’.

She said that a 2011 survey by the charity, for which she is president, found that 87 per cent of single parents feel there is a stigma around single parenthood that must be challenged.

The author added in the Gingerbread article: ‘I find the language of "skivers versus strivers" particularly offensive when it comes to single parents, who are already working around the clock to care for their children. ‘

Miss Rowling said that when she was a single mother, it was a ‘much bigger delusion’ to believe that she could get back into paid work - than the children’s novel she was working on might be published.

She added: 'I would say to any single 
parent currently feeling the weight of stereotype or stigmatization that
I am prouder of my years as a single mother than of any other part of 
my life.'

It was 
recently announced that Miss Rowling was making her screenwriting debut 
with a spin-off film based on a minor character in her stories about 
teenage wizard Potter.

Fantastic
Beasts And Where To Find Them is the first in a planned series inspired
by the textbook of the same name given to Hogwarts pupils and will 
feature its fictitious author, Newt Scamander.

The
commercial success of the Harry Potter books and films, which made 
stars of Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, guarantees the new film will 
be a hit.

The last film in 
the series, Harry Potter And the Deathly Hallows - Part 2, took 
£23million in the UK and Ireland in its opening weekend alone.

Royal appointment: JK Rowling met the Queen in March 2001 in London, nine months before she married Neil

Support: JK Rowling in 2000 after donating £500,000 in support of single mothers. The donation to the National Council for One Parent Families (now Gingerbread) was described by the charity as 'staggering'

Earlier this year, Rowling was unmasked as the author of a crime novel, The Cuckoo’s Calling, written and published under the pseudonym of Robert Galbraith.

The book, which sold about 8,500 copies before she was named as the author, has since become a worldwide bestseller.

The films’ star Daniel Radcliffe said of the Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them film: 'I'm sure they're going to have a great time. I'm sure a lot of people will be really excited.'

But he added: 'I, needless to say, won't be involved. I don't know if any of us (the original Potter cast) will be. I know nothing about it.'
