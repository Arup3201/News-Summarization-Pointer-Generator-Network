Surrendered: James Hollingsworth, 59, turned himself in on Wednesday to face criminal charges for the April death of his 20-month-old granddaughter in a hot car

A grandfather from Texas has turned himself in to police in order to face criminal charges for the death of his granddaughter.

James Hollingsworth, 59, was released on a $5,000 bond from the North Richland Hills Detention Facility in North Texas.

He is believed to have caused the death of his 20-month-old granddaughter by heatstroke last April, by leaving her in a hot car.

Police say Hollingsworth called 911 on
 April 22nd of this year after his 11-year-old grandson discovered
 Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth in her grandfather's car.

Hollingsworth was supposed to drop Aurora off at daycare that morning after taking her mother to work, but he forgot and left her in the vehicle until he made the afternoon school run.

The baby died in the car with the outside temperature around 84 degrees.

'This
 is a tragic event for all those involved and if anything we’d like this
 to be a learning lesson to other people, anytime you are responsible 
for the safety of a child,' officer Keith Bauman said.

Heatstroke:  Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth was found dead in a car seat inside a vehicle on  April 22

Tragic: Hollingsworth was supposed to drop Aurora off at daycare that morning after taking her mother to work

'Mr.
 Hollingsworth dropped off his daughter, returned to his residence and 
went inside, forgetting to drop off Aurora at day-care, leaving her 
inside his vehicle,' Bauman said.

'It
 does not have to be a sweltering day of 100 plus temperatures for it to
 be dangerous for a child to be in that vehicle,’ he said.

'We are still investigating,' attorney Lex Johnston of Hurst said. 'We don’t believe it will end up a criminal matter. It was a terrible tragedy for everyone involved.'

At 3:30 p.m. that afternoon, 
Hollingsworth’s daughter called and asked him to pick up her 11-year-old
 son from school because he had missed his bus and was walking home.

Hollingsworth found the boy, let him in the car and started driving home, police said.

Lessons:  'This is a tragic event for all those involved and if anything we¿d like this to be a learning lesson to other people, anytime you are responsible for the safety of a child,' officer Keith Bauman said

Charges: Aurora's death is still under investigation. Hollingsworth faces a charge of injury to a child by omission

Accidental death: Aurora Aryana Hollingsworth died of heatstroke after being left in a car and her death was ruled an accident

After climbing inside the car, the boy told his grandfather that something was wrong with Aurora.

She had died in her car seat.

Child Protective Services investigators are looking into the case. Aurora had three older siblings ages 6, 8 and 11.

Aurora was the 17th child to die of heatstroke in a car this year. Last year there were 44 such deaths in the U.S.

In most cases, the caregiver simply forgot about the child.

Studies show that on average, temperatures inside a vehicle can increase rapidly in a relatively short space of time: up to 19 degrees in 10 minutes and 34 degrees in half an hour.
