Devastating flash floods and landslides triggered by heavy rains have killed nearly 300 people in northern India and Pakistan, it today emerged. 

More than 120 people have died in Indian-controlled Kashmir following five days of monsoon rains, in the region's worst flooding in  decades.

At least 450 villages have been submerged by water, while 2,000 others have been affected by the floods and landslides, officials said. 

All schools, colleges and offices have been shut, and electricity and drinking water supplies have been limited across the region.

In neighbouring Pakistan, more than 160 people have died and thousands of homes have collapsed in what is fast becoming a 'national emergency'. 

Rescuers in both countries were today using helicopters and boats to try to reach tens of thousands of people stranded in their homes.

However, rescue efforts in Srinagar, the main city in Kashmir, were hampered by fast-moving floodwaters that submerged large parts of the city.

Although the rains had stopped today, the spreading water from the overflowed Jhelum river was moving too fast to allow boats to reach many of the residents, officials said.

By this evening, several boats had been deployed to start rescue efforts, said Omar Abdullah, Jammu and Kashmir state's top elected official.

In many of Srinagar's neighborhoods, the water was about 12ft deep, submerging entire houses. Stranded residents left their homes to move in with friends or relatives in safer areas.

Floodwaters entered the first floor of the state's main maternity hospital, forcing more than 200 patients and attendants to move to higher floors of the building.

Meanwhile, thousands of police officers and army rescue workers were fanned out across Jammu and Kashmir to help with relief and rescue efforts.

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, who surveyed the flood-hit areas from a helicopter, promised the state federal help to deal with the devastation, which he described as a 'national level disaster'.

He said that the flooding had hit 286 villages in Punjab as several rivers breached their banks and that the crisis was rapidly becoming a 'national emergency'.

More than 4,000 homes across Pakistan have collapsed, rendering thousands of people homeless. Pakistan's armed forces and civilian rescuers have mounted a massive operation using helicopters and boats to get villagers to safety.

Mr Kamal said 95 relief camps had been set up for those displaced by the flooding.

Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, but claimed in its entirety by both countries.
