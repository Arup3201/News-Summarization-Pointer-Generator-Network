A vulnerable dementia patient filled his house with an estimated £15,000 of unwanted Reader's Digest books - in the hope that he'd win a prize.

He bought anything and everything - from history volumes to Noddy hardbacks - and hid them in every available corner of his home.

As he bought more books, he became more convinced he was moving up the ladder towards winning a Reader's Digest prize.

Books: Catherine Shilling's father   filled his house with £15,000 of Reader's Digest books to 'win a prize'

His daughter Catherine Shilling was shocked to learn the truth when he was taken ill and moved in to a care home.

She found his house, in Inverness, crammed with books stuffed under cushions, stacked in wardrobes and behind cupboards.

He'd also been targeted by more than 100 charities, and his underwear drawers were overflowing with their thank you letters.

Mrs Shilling has blasted the unscrupulous sales tactics of those who targeted her 89-year-old father and bombarded him with literature.

Her MP, Lib Dem Danny Alexander has called more protection for the vulnerable from cold callers and mail order firms.

Mrs Shilling, 53, has asked for her father, who lived in Cradlehall, Inverness, not to be named.

She believes he spent around £20,000 altogether, the majority on books and some in response to appeals from more than 100 charities, as well as herbal supplements.

'He was actually running out of hiding places for all the books,' said Mrs Shilling. 'I could not believe my eyes. There was everything from countryside and animal books to Noddy hardbacks.'

More than 127 charities were also in regular contact with and a paper trail suggests he gave away at least £4,000 to good causes in recent years.

Danny Alexander MP, who is also Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has now intervened to try and help the family recover some of the money and investigate the wider issue of how the vulnerable and elderly can be protected from cold callers and mail order firms.

Mrs Shilling, of Castlehill Drive, Cradlehall, said the last the family knew of her father's finances he had about £17,000 in his account.

'When we saw how much he had in the last month or two it was down to about £5,000,' she said. 'We think he spent more than this over the last few years. He was going in and withdrawing £900 in cash at a time and what he was doing with the money we do not know. All we do know is he was paying out about £200 a week and he was spending less and less on food.'

Her father kept up to date with his bill payments, however, and has left no debts.

As well as books and charities, he was persuaded to buy hundreds of pounds worth of herbal supplements by telesales companies that phoned him at home.

Some of the tablets could have had a dangerous interaction with his blood-thinning medication and one of the mail-order herbal supplement firms has agreed to refund the family £500.

Although they have done nothing illegal, Mrs Shilling believes some of the sales tactics used on her father were unscrupulous.

She said Reader's Digest sent him letters saying the purchases earned him honorary points on its customer database for prize draws and he started to believe he was going to win something.

'He was telling us they were going to collect him in a car and take him down to London,' she said. 'He was even asking us if we were free on those dates because he was allowed to take us too.'

Readers Digest declined to comment on the case.

Yesterday Mr Alexander said everyone had a duty to care for the elderly and companies and charities using direct debit were no exception.

'I am looking into this with my Highland Lib-Dem colleagues and we will do everything we can both to ensure a satisfactory outcome for the family and to make it clear to all companies and charities that they must take a responsible approach to direct debits,' he said.

Highland Council's champion for older people, Kate Stephens, said the case highlighted a growing problem and the local authority was organising a seminar to address the issue.

'The environment is changing,' she said. 'People are not aware of all the new ways for financial abuse to occur. The support that is offered needs to be reviewed to make sure that it is fit-for-purpose.'

However, Cradlehall councillor Carolyn Caddick believed the organisations involved had done nothing illegal.

'You couldn't even argue that they were morally wrong because they probably were not even aware of the situation this chap was in,' she said. 'This is just something that people need to be aware of, about how vulnerable people are when they are elderly.'
