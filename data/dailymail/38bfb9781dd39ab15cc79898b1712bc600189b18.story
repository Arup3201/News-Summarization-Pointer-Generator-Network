A devoted couple who met on the day World War II broke out and vowed never to be parted, have died within days of each other.

In a story worthy of a tear jerking Hollywood script Aquilla Brant, 100, passed away just 12 days after 96-year-old Catherine, his wife of 72-years.

The inseparable couple, who were both suffering from pneumonia, will now be cremated together.

Their daughter, Sue Brant, 68, revealed that the doting pair, who met in 1939, had a pact not to be parted.

'Dad used to say 'when mum goes I'll go a fortnight later' and he died 12 days after her,' said the mother-of-two. 

'Mum died first and it was very sudden. They were both frail but were very lucid until the end.

'It's a nice end that they have gone together.'

Mr Brant, whose first name is Latin for eagle, was in the St John Ambulance and was called to train others in lifesaving skills at the outbreak of World War II.

The retired electrician was training a group of 12 men at a fever hospital in Dalton, West Yorks., when he met his wife, who was working as a nurse.

The couple fell for each other after Mr Brant was told to seek out the young nurse to help him find tea and sugar.  

 The romantics married on April 8, 1942 at Almondbury Church before spending a few days on honeymoon in Ilkley, West Yorks.

By the time of his wedding Mr Brant had been called up into the Army while his wife continued working as a nurse.

When he was demobbed in 1946 he started work at a chemical plant, he later moved to work for many years at a power station, where he was a maintenance electrician.

Catherine worked as a nurse until she left to bring up her family.

Speaking on their 72nd wedding anniversary in April last year, Mr Brant said: 'Yes, it was love at first sight.

'We just love each other. Of course we've had our ups and downs like everybody else and someone once asked me how we'd stayed together so long.

'I told them it was two little words. Yes, dear.'

He added that they rarely had a cross word and if they did they always sorted it out.

The aged couple, of Huddersfield, West Yorks., shared a double room at Pilling House residential home in Skelmanthorpe.

Their daughter said: 'It was December 16 and it was Dad's 100th birthday so we were going to have a party. I got a call saying Mum was ill.

'She had pneumonia and died at 4am the next morning. It was a tremendous shock.

'Dad was admitted to Barnsley General Hospital 24 hours later and he had pneumonia but also had a heart attack.'

Mr Brant stayed in the hospital over the Christmas period and died peacefully on December 29 with family at his bedside.

'Dad was devastated when Mum died and he took it really hard,' said their daughter.

 'He knew he didn't want to continue without her.

'It has been quite a difficult time but we know it was what they wanted. It's is nice that they can now have their funeral together.' 

The couple went on to have three children Carl, Susan and Hazel, two grandchildren John and Amanda and four great-grandchildren Tom, Sam, Alexandra and William.

The funeral is at St John's Church, Lepton, on January 8 at 12.15pm, followed by cremation.

The family are making donations to the Forget me Not Children's Hospice.
