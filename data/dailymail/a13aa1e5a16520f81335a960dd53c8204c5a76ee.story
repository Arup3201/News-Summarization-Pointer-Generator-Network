In the depths of the countryside, it is not unusual to find young lambs huddled in front of a fireplace or swaddled in a blanket in a farmer's living room as they are nursed back to health.

However, it's not often the newborn lambs begin to favour their newfound human surroundings over grassy fields and hay-filled barns.

But, that’s exactly what’s happened to one youngster, who is now having an ‘identity crisis’ after preferring to be more like his dog playmate.

Keith, the 'sheep dog', was taken in by Anna Burton when he was born prematurely at the family's farm in Nidderdale, North Yorkshire, in February this year.

Miss Burton, 19, only brought the newborn into the house in order to take care of him as he was abandoned by his mother and was a 'very small' lamb.

Since then, Keith has adjusted to life indoors and has been spotted stealing food from the dogs' bowls, watching TV and snuggling up for cuddles with his owner.

Miss Burton, a college student, said the lamb now gets on so well with the family dog, Toby, that they are often found playing together on the farm.

She said: 'He was born prematurely at the end of February this year to a sheep who we thought was having twins, but actually had triplets.

He even shares the dog's bowl with the family's other six dogs and likes to spend time in the family home

Miss Burton said he enjoys watching TV, having cuddles with her and eating dog food with the other animals

He has formed a strong bond with the family's dog, Toby, and they can often be seen playing together

'We didn't find Keith for a few hours by which point he wasn't very well and was too small to get milk from his mum.

'He spent about one week learning how to stand up and lived inside for over a month, usually just sitting by the dogs or on the sofa with me.

'Our dog Toby used to get very protective of people touching him or going near him.

'He and Keith get on well together now and I often find him in the barn with him.'

It is not the first time the family has brought a lamb into the house, but never before has one made themselves at home as much as Keith. 

Miss Burton said Keith, who has grown considerably since February, enjoys walks with the family's dogs

She said: ''Our dog Toby used to get very protective of people touching him or going near him'

The family have moved Keith to a barn outside the family home, but said he is often found wandering back in

The family currently have six dogs but Keith believes himself to be the seventh member of the pack.

Miss Burton said: 'Keith has fit right in with the dogs. They are all still very protective of him even though he is actually bigger than them now.

'It must be confusing for them because Keith thinks he is one of them. The other sheep don't like him very much though.

'Keith sits and waits for his food just like the dogs and whenever he saw one of them jump onto the sofa he would try and jump up too. He would also come for walks round the fields too.'

Miss Burton is used to having sheep around, having grown up around them on the farm, and has gained vast experience through her childhood in looking after them. 

Keith was rather unwell and fragile when he was born in February (pictured) and was taken in by the family

He was nursed back to health in the family's home, where Miss Burton fed him up and kept him warm

The pair even snuggle up on the sofa together, although Keith has grown remarkably since he was a baby

She is currently studying for a business and management degree at Harrogate College but is looking to go into vet nursing next year.

Due to his current size, Keith is now too big to live in the house and is currently living in a barn with three other sheep, who were also unwell when they were born.

However, keeping Keith out of the house has proved difficult for the family as at any opportunity, the 'sheep dog' likes to wander in.

Miss Burton added: 'He lives in a barn outside with three other sheep.

'Although, Keith does still like to come for a wander in the house when he gets the chance.

'He just generally really enjoys human company.'

Miss Burton said Keith, the 'sheep dog' is often found trotting in and out of the family home as he pleases

He is now almost fully-grown and has been moved to a barn on the farm, where he lives with other sheep

Despite his new home, he loves popping back in to the main house for food and to see his owners and dogs
