A toddler debilitated by an abnormal growth that weighed more than the rest of his body, is able to run free for the first time following its removal.

Riley Campbell, now aged 16 months, suffered from a rare lymphatic  malformation on his back which caused him to fall over when he attempted to walk.

His parents couldn't let him out of their sight in case the 4.5lb mass, which had its own blood supply, ruptured and he bled to death.

But now, thanks to a ten-hour operation, Riley is able to run around with his siblings Declan, 17, Lauren, 15 and four-year-old Leona.

The giant growth when it was removed, weighed 4.5lbs meaning premature Riley was just 3lbs when he was born.

Mother Yvonne, 35, said: 'It was horrific what we went through but Riley’s made of strong stuff.

'He’s just like other children his age now. He’s into everything. It’s amazing.'

The growth was spotted when Yvonne and husband Jordan, from Irvine, North Ayrshire, went for a 32-week scan.

At first, it was not known whether the growth was attached to Yvonne or her unborn baby.

Mother Yvonne said: 'He'll be scarred for life but it's a small price to pay. I call it his shark bite because it looks like one.'

But a more detailed scan revealed that the growth was in fact attached to Riley, and his parents feared the worse.

They were given another blow when it was
discovered it had it’s own blood supply and Riley had rapidly been 
losing blood while in the womb. It was also suspected that the growth could be 
on his brain.

However specialists were unable to tell 
because of the baby’s position so an MRI scan was scheduled for a week 
later. But the scan was never conducted as Yvonne suddenly went into labour.

She
had an emergency caesarean section because the growth could have caused
the baby to get stuck, cutting off the oxygen supply.

Riley was born five weeks premature and weighed seven and a half pounds including the weight of his growth.

Yvonne said: 'They brought him to show me before he was whisked away.

'I’d tried to prepare myself but I didn’t know what to expect. It was massive.'

Riley was immediately transferred to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.

There, he was diagnosed with a 
lymphatic malformation, which results from an abnormal development of 
the lymphatic vessels that drain fluid from tissues.

When these vessels develop abnormally
they can cause a localised swelling, often with cysts, and sometimes 
blood vessels can also develop abnormally in the same area.

Doctors said it was too dangerous to 
remove the growth because it was so close to his liver and lungs and he 
was too small for such a major operation.

Riley was kept in intensive care and doctors monitored him around the clock in case the growth ruptured and he bled to death.

After two weeks in hospital, 
doctors finally allowed Riley’s parents to take him home.

Yvonne said: 'It was such a relief but we were so scared. We had to be so careful.

'We were taught how to resuscitate him and were told to take him straight to hospital if he became pale or listless.

'As he got older, I wouldn’t let him out my sight in case he knocked it and it bled like it did in the womb.

'When he learnt to walk, he kept falling over because of the weight of it.'

Just after Riley’s first birthday, in 
October last year, doctors decided it was safe to operate after a scan 
showed the growth had moved.

Surgeons discovered it had spread 
to his ribs and muscles. The intricate operation took ten hours as if any of the growth had been left, it could have grown back.

Riley was given a blood transfusion and needed skin grafts because the scar was so large.

After the operation, he was moved to intensive care and put on a ventilator to allow his body to recover and finally, a month later, he was allowed to go home.

Yvonne said: 'He’ll be scarred for life but it’s a small price to pay. I call it his shark bite because it looks like one.

'I’ve got a scrap book with photos of him in hospital to show him what he came through.

'I don’t want him to be self conscious of his scar. I want him to be proud of it.'

Medics at Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, revealed that Riley's case was unusual, because of the positioning of the growth, and as a result the operation took longer than the standard procedure.

A spokesperson said: 'We’re very pleased with how Riley has recovered from his surgery although we’ll need to keep a check on him as he grows older to ensure that he doesn’t develop difficulties related to his scar.'
