John Terry has interrupted his summer holiday for extra fitness training this week.

Terry, who has signed a new one-year contract at Stamford Bridge, posted a video clip on the social media app ‘Fanzai’.

He can be seen sprinting down the touchline wearing his Chelsea training gear at the club’s Surrey training base.

Making his point: Terry is determined to return for the new season in peak condition

For many, the 33-year-old centre-half 
should be with England at the World Cup in Brazil but he retired from 
international football in 2012.

He was in splendid form last season and manager Jose Mourinho claimed his consistency was helped by the fact he was able to rest and recuperate during the international breaks, rather than jet around playing for England.

Terry is determined to keep his standards up and keep himself  in top shape during the summer.
