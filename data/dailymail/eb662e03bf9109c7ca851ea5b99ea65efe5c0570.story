Whether you use it to share news and emotions, or to complain about brands, what you write on Twitter may say more about you than you think.

Now, an interactive tool can analyse your most recent tweets and its creator claims it can reveal your personality, by looking at how you use words.

Called Analyse Words, it generates a user’s emotional style and says whether they are upbeat, worried, angry or depressed, as well as revealing someone’s social and thinking styles.

The tool is created by James Pennebaker, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who studies the link between language and personality.

To get results, users simply have to enter their Twitter handle and press a button that says 'Analyse Tweets'.

A results page is then generated that counts the number of recent words studied and lists the latest tweets.

But most intriguingly it tells users how upbeat, worried, angry and depressed they are, in terms of percentages.

Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet, whereas the tweets of people who are predominantly worried contain anxious words and nervous questions.

By inputting a Twitter handle, such as a celebrity's a result page is generated that counts the number of recent words studied and lists the latest tweets. It can be used to show the difference between people's emotional, social and thinking styles. For example, President Obama (left) is upbeat, while Katy Perry (right) is depressed

Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet.

Tweets by worried users are dominated by anxious words and nervous questions.

Angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals.

Depressed people make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says.

Angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals and people who have a high depression score make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says.

The tool also analyses a user's social style and says whether they are plugged in, personable, arrogant or spacy.

'Plugged in' tweeters are socially engaged and use social words as well as talking to specific friends, according to the tool.

Personable people use positive emotional words, pose questions and reference others frequently, while those who are 'arrogant or distant' tend to be well-read with 'an arms-length approach to socialising'.

'You scored high in this category if you discuss actions instead of emotions, use big words and don’t reference yourself much,' it says.

Twitter users who score highly in being a 'spacy valley girl' are excitable and have a habit of tweeting LOLLLLLs, the tool says.

It also analyses user's thinking styles and tells them to what extent their tweets show they are analytical, sensory or how they seem to live in the moment.

Users who are most upbeat use lots of positive words and 'we' when they tweet, whereas angry Twitter users say 'you' a lot and write in capitals, while depressed people make lots of self-references and tend to be inward-looking, the tool says. Singer Katy Perry's results are shown, which says she is depressed

Dr Pennebacker has previously developed a computer program called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) which looks at the choice, frequency and context of words to gauge a person’s psychological state, Maria Konnikova writes for the New Yorker. 

'Since the creation of the LIWC, in 1993, studies utilising the program have suggested a close connection between our language, our state of mind, and our behaviour,’ she writes.

For example, one study showed that the words used on a date can predict people’s desire to be with someone, or in another situation can indicate a person’s importance at work or even their sex and mental state.

The tool also analyses a user's social style and says whether they are plugged in, personable, arrogant, meaning distant, and or spacy. Kanye West's results are shown above, which show he is mostly personable

A study by psychologists at the University of Pennsylvania last month revealed that words used in social media profiles can help determine parts of the US that are more likely to have high numbers of deaths due to heart disease.

Psychologist Johannes Eichstaedt led a team that analysed 826million tweets from 1,400 counties in the US for words associated with anger, anxiety and other emotions, to emotionally profile users.

They found that counties where people’s tweets included hostile, aggressive and lazy words, such as ‘jealous’ and ‘bored’ had higher rates of death from heart attacks and strokes, whereas places with more positive tweeters had less.

This suggests that negative and angry language used on social media could be used to predict medical conditions, but the field of research is young.
