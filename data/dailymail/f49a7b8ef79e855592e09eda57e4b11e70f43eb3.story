This picture captures the moment an over-confident burglar grinned behind the wheel of a luxury convertible he had just helped to steal.

Ashley Jordan has been jailed for two years after police used the photo to help link him to the theft of the Saab as well as a BMW and £26,000 of goods stolen from a couple's home as they slept.

The 22-year-old kept the incriminating images on a memory stick, which he desperately tried to flush down the toilet when police raided his home in Leeds.

'Arrogant': Ashley Jordan sitting behind the wheel of a Saab convertible he had just helped to steal

Jordan wept in Leeds Crown Court yesterday as he was sentenced to two years in prison for the thefts.

The court heard that he was a member of gang who targeted a house in the suburb of Barwick-in-Elmet on March 19 last year.

They removed the lock on the door and took the keys to a BMW and Saab convertible as the couple who lived there slept upstairs.

The gang also stole cash, a 60-inch television and iPhones, with the total value of the goods adding up to £26,000.

Caught: Police used this BMW's licence plate to link it to a burglary from a house in a suburb of Leeds

Police visited Jordan's house after he was seen trying to carry the giant TV inside.

When they arrived, they found Jordan trying to discard a memory stick in the toilet, according to the prosecution, but officers managed to retrieve the data.

Images on the stick showed Jordan posing with the two vehicles, which police were able to link back to the burglary thanks to the number plate on the BMW - which has not been recovered.

Jordan told officers his friends had decided to carry out the burglary after they spent the evening in the pub.

He claimed he did not take part in the raid, but admitted helping to move stolen items afterwards.

Jordan pleaded guilty to burglary and two offences of theft.

His lawyer said in court that he was ashamed of his actions, and no longer associated with the other members of the gang.

After the sentencing, a police spokesman said: 'The incriminating images that led to Jordan being caught illustrate the arrogance and disregard for the victims that burglars like him have.

'They proved to be very useful in linking him to the crime and we are grateful to him for inadvertently providing such valuable evidence.'
