To any onlooker who saw her on her way to class yesterday, she would have seemed like just another smiling seven-year-old.

But for Lydia Warner, the day marked the milestone end of a remarkable journey.

Almost two years ago, the little girl was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of cancer,  and her parents were told she had just weeks to live.

Lydia Warner, 7, had pancreatoblastoma - a rare cancer of the pancreas. She has now been given the all-clear after receiving part of her mother, Kate's, liver during a life-saving transplant operation

But she defied the odds to beat pancreatoblastoma - a condition which only affects one child every two years in the UK.

Doctors told her parents 
Kate, 35, and Paul, 39, there was nothing they could do after finding a 
tumour on Lydia's pancreas near the main blood vessels of her bowel.

Further tests showed the cancer had spread to Lydia's liver, where a cluster of nine small tumours were growing.

After being told she was dying, her parents devoted their time to making the most of Lydia's final months and the family even travelled to Disneyland courtesy of the Make a Wish Foundation which helps terminally ill children.

But the couple from Whitley, in Yorkshire, refused to give up on their daughter and kept pushing to find a cure for her.

One of the doctors at their local hospital discussed her case with surgeons at Birmingham Children's Hospital, 116 miles away, who said they may be able to perform transplant surgery to save her.

Lydia was diagnosed after becoming fatigued and developing a swollen stomach. Her parents were told her cancer was terminal and had spread to her liver. But just three months after the operation, she has now returned to school

As a result, her mother, a children's
care home manager, donated part of her own liver after tests showed her
organs were a perfect match for Lydia.

In April, Lydia underwent a six-hour operation to have her entire liver removed and replaced with a portion of her mother’s.

Now, just three months after her life-saving operation, she has returned to school, after being given the all-clear by her doctors.

Mrs Warner said: ‘As soon as we knew I was the right blood type it was a no brainer, it's just what any mother would do for their child.

‘When I found out I was the right blood group I just thought “it's up to me then”.

‘I feel happy knowing that Lydia has got a part of my liver and she feels happy as well.

‘It's still very surreal to think about 
but it's unbelievable, she's a miracle. From the first diagnosis I can't
believe how far we have come.

‘From being told she was dying to now see her jumping and laughing with her friends at school is wonderful. We're really grateful and feel very lucky.’

Lydia was first diagnosed with pancreatoblastoma in September 2011 after her parents noticed her energy levels waning.

The family were given hope when doctors said that they might be able to cure her with a transplant - they removed her liver, spleen and most of her pancreas and gave her part of her mother's liver

Mrs Warner said: ‘She just wasn't herself, there was nothing significant but she just seemed a bit sluggish.

‘Her
stomach swelled up and we took her to Doncaster Royal Infirmary where 
they told us it was definitely cancer but they weren't sure what kind.

‘We were transferred to Sheffield Children's Hospital where they initially thought it was lymphoma but more tests showed it was pancreatoblastoma.

‘It had spread to the lymph nodes and the liver - from the outset her prognosis wasn't hopeful. We were absolutely devastated.

‘The consultant sat us down and said there was nothing more they could do.

‘The treatment continued but they basically said “go and enjoy life, make the most of it because she won't survive”.

‘As a parent to be told your little girl is going to die and there's nothing they can do is the most horrendous thing to hear.

When it was believed that Lydia was dying, her parents decided to make the most of every last minute so they took her to Disneyland in the U.S.

Pancreatoblastoma is a rare cancer of the pancreas which usually occurs during childhood.

Children
with the disease rarely show symptoms when it is in its early stages, 
most do not have any symptoms until it is quite advanced.

At this point, symptoms include abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting.

The tumours tend to be between two and twenty centimetres in size.

Treatment usually involves an operation, if the tumour is operable, and then chemotherapy.

‘We tried to make the most of things,
we went to Disneyland in America, visited family in South Africa and 
made a few trips to Devon, which is a family favourite.

‘Every time we were thinking “this could be the last”.

‘The strange thing was that Lydia seemed
to be getting better to us, she was still going swimming, yet we were 
being told she was terminal.’

Lydia underwent six bouts of 
chemotherapy but on Boxing Day 2011 her family was told that, although 
the tumours had shrunk, they hadn't disappeared.

Lydia
was referred to Birmingham Children's Hospital - one of two centres in 
the UK that can perform liver and small bowel transplants - where a 
specialist team reviewed the scans and said they may be able to cure 
Lydia.

Surgeons performed the first step of a two-stage procedure in November last year, removing the primary tumour along with Lydia's spleen and two-thirds of her pancreas.

At the same time medics assessed the 
youngster's liver and decided that it would be possible to deal with the
tumours using a liver transplant - meaning an agonising wait for a 
donor.

Lydia was put on
a waiting list but during a discussion with a donor co-ordinator Mrs 
Warner found out it was possible to be considered for a live organ 
donation.

Lydia has since made a remarkable recovery and yesterday said she was ¿chuffed¿ to be back at school

Mrs Warner went under the knife at the 
Queen Elizabeth Hospital, five miles away from where Lydia lay waiting 
for her donor liver.

During the six-hour procedure, part of Mrs Warner’s liver was transported across Birmingham to be transplanted into Lydia.

Two teams of liver transplant consultants performed each operation - Mr Khalid Sharif and Mr Darius Mirza on Lydia, and Paolo Muiesan and John Isaac performed the operation on her mother.

Mr Sharif said: ‘It was a two-step procedure. First we removed the spleen, part of the pancreas and the main tumour.

‘While carrying out that operation it gave us chance to consider the tumours on her liver - the options were to leave it or actively go for it.

‘We thought we cannot let the family live with this - so we decided to go for the second step and perform a transplant.’

Lydia has since made a remarkable recovery and yesterday said she was ‘chuffed’ to be back at school.

She said: ‘I have missed all my friends and couldn't wait to see them all again.

‘My favourite subject is maths and I'm looking forward to going swimming again. I'm very excited. I'm chuffed it's all over.’

The youngster will have to take medication for the rest of her life to ensure her body does not reject the donor liver, and her hearing was damaged by chemotherapy.
