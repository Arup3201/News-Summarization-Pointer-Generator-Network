Leinster and Ireland prop Cian Healy talks to Sportsmail about partying in Ibiza and saving his pet turtle. 

Who is your sporting hero?  

All Blacks legend Jonah Lomu — pure power and pace.

What would you be if you weren’t a rugby player?

Hopefully an Olympian, preferably the shot put. I was pretty good in my younger days.

Career highlight?

Winning that first Heineken Cup with Leinster (against Leicester in 2009). It had been such a long wait.

... and the Worst moment?

Coming home from the Lions tour of Australia (in 2013) because of injury. I tore my ankle ligaments in just the second game. I’d been looking forward to it so much.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

My turtle! He’s called Ralph and lives in the kitchen. I’ve had him over five years. I’ve also got two dogs but they have to stay out the back — the turtle was my idea.

What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given?

Don’t listen to other people’s advice. I got told that a long time ago from somebody in rugby.

Favourite karaoke song?

Cotton Eye Joe by Rednex. I’ve sung that once or twice. Am I any good? No, brutal!

Three most-listened to songs on your ipod?

It wouldn’t be three, I’d shuffle. It’d mainly be house music (Cian also DJs at events such as Oxegen).

Last film you saw?

I watched Godzilla with some mates. It was all right — does what it says on the tin.

Healy suffered ankle ligament damage early in the 2013 Lions tour and subsequently missed the Test series 

Last book you read?

Couldn’t tell you. I’m not a big reader.

if you could invite three people round for dinner, who would they be? 

Jay-Z and Rihanna — for everything that goes with them, and they’d probably bring their entourages. And Bill Clinton, because I think he’s very insightful.

Favourite Pre-match meal?

Scrambled eggs and chicken.

Can you cook? Best dish?

I can and my best dish would be baked salmon with veg.

Your Favourite holiday destination?

Ibiza. Because it’s Ibiza — and I’m all right at dancing.

In a film of your life, who would you like to play you?

The Rock. He’d make me look bigger.

What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought?

My car . . . no, my house!

Tell us a secret...

When I’m DJ-ing, I’m not Cian Healy, I’m DJ Church! I also paint and I have done abstract portraits of other rugby players.
