Most newlyweds whisk themselves away to a beach, or retreat to a luxurious hotel room.

But Kat and Steve Turner took a slightly different approach.

After tying the knot, they embarked on a two-year honeymoon, riding 20,000 miles around the globe on a tandem.

Newlyweds Kat and Steve Turner flew to Bigbury Bay, New Zealand, for their wedding reception in August 2011. Today they cycled into Plymouth, 674 days after setting off on their trusty tandem bike, Hooch

The couple, from London, set off from New Zealand in April 2012 and have spent 674 days pedalling the same bike home across three continents.

Amazingly Mrs Turner, 32, had never even ridden a bike before they took on the challenge with trusty tandem Hooch.

Yesterday, the intrepid couple finally set foot on British soil after travelling through rainforests, deserts, floods and even earthquakes.

Their journey took them through New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Greece, Italy and France.

They were met by applauding family and friends as they arrived in a ferry at Plymouth docks in Devon.

Waiting for them on the dockside, Mr Turner's dad, Ian, said: 'When they left I only gave them one piece of advice and that was to make sure they came home together - even if the trip only lasted two weeks.

'As it happens they have stuck at the challenge for two years, cycling through deserts and rainforests, cities and empty roads, surviving harsh weather, stray dogs, floods and even earthquakes.

Kat, 32, from London, had never ridden a bike before they set off, leaving well-paid jobs behind them

'Their journey has been full of 
adventure and along the way they have encountered hospitality and 
kindness from so many different people.

'They have a terrific story to tell. We are all in awe of both Kat and Steve and massively excited to see them.'

The pair left behind well-paid jobs as a teacher and Parliamentary caseworker before leaving their pets and home in Forest Hill, south east London.

Their mammoth 30,500km route, raising money for development charity Practical Action, saw them climbing a total elevation of 249,365m - the equivalent of Everest 28 times - and complete a gruelling 1,585 of actual pedalling.

The couple, here with Hasan who guided them through Tashkent, climbed the equivalent of 28 Everests

Their second-last stop was a country-wide tour of Italy. Here, Kat enjoys the view over Pozzuoli

Steve enjoyed a pizza in Georgia, months before they reached Italy, where they visited Solfatara Volcano

Mr Turner, 34, suffered a terrible 
episode of heat exhaustion in Cambodia and Kat fractured her knee-cap 
after they hit a railway track in the Australian Outback.

They
 were in the eastern Chinese town of Dingxi when an earthquake hit, 
killing 95 people in July last year, and were regularly challenged by 
officials in the strict country.

Speaking during the trip, Steve said Kyrgyzstan was the highlight.

The teacher said: 'It was a great experience because we didn't know what to expect as we'd never heard of it before and couldn't even spell it.

Today, they were welcomed home by family and friends as they carted into Plymouth, bronzed and exhausted

'The mountains were stunning, the nomadic people on horseback were friendly, it was interesting to see yurts being packed up for the winter and we spent peaceful nights camping under the stars.

'The sight of us two on our huge tandem and trailer makes people laugh. People are excited to talk to us about our trip.

'We've been completely taken aback by the many acts of kindness we have received, from being handed a chocolate bar or cold drink out of the window of a passing vehicle, to being warmly welcomed into the homes of strangers and fed wonderful meals.'
