Remember that scorching September – sunny, warm and the driest on record?

It only ended a week ago but soon it could seem like a distant memory. This week Britain will be battered by torrential downpours, hail storms and gales of up to 70mph.

Temperatures are already plummeting and parts of the Highlands even had their first snow of the year yesterday.

Last night the Met Office issued weather warnings for the length of Britain’s western coast as a fierce Atlantic storm approached.

Up to three inches of rain will fall in the worst hit areas and it is feared this could cause flash flooding. Daytime temperatures will struggle to get above 17C (63F) today and will drop to a bitter 3C (37F) in some parts overnight.

The fiercest storms are set to clear by tomorrow, but the rain and wind will continue through the week.

Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite warned that a stubborn area of low pressure over the UK will bring unsettled conditions until next week.

Temperatures fell to as low as five degrees in parts of Northumberland, where an early morning blanket of fog covered the Tyne Valley

He said yesterday: ‘There is a system developing to the west which will move in through Sunday night and Monday morning. Coastal regions in the west could see strong gusts of up to 70mph in exposed regions though it will be a wet and windy day generally on Monday.

‘There is a heavy band of rain moving across the country during the day, reaching London and the east by the middle of the day. It is going to be unsettled for the rest of the week thanks to low pressure which isn’t moving away quickly. Instead it is going to hang around bringing more showers and the potential for heavy rain until the weekend.

‘It is also going to feel cooler than we have seen with temperatures slightly below average for the time of year, though it will be milder at night.’

The fog began to disperse as the temperatures increased, with highs of 14 degrees in parts of the north-east today - but storms are just around the corner

The first snow of the season fell in the Cairngorm Mountains in Scotland as the mercury dropped below freezing, hitting -1.4C (29.5F) in the nearby village of Braemar.

The Mountain Weather Information Service warned there could be more sleet and snow this week.

Leon Brown, of The Weather Channel UK, said heavy rain could trigger flash floods in western parts.

He added: ‘Gusts of up to 70mph are possible in Cornwall, Devon, west Wales and western Scotland which may bring down a few trees and certainly large branches and a lot of leaves. Low pressure will then dominate the rest of next week.

‘We can expect bands of heavy showers, especially over the west, with hail and thunder.

‘Temperatures are feeling rather cool so coats and hats at the ready, and beware your umbrella doesn’t blow inside out.’

A Met Office warning said: ‘Given the very strong winds and their coincidence with Monday’s rush hour, as well as standing water on roads, some disruption to travel is likely.’

The Environment Agency issued flood alerts for the coast between Plymouth and Lyme Regis and for the North Sea coast at Bridlington, Yorkshire, where high tides were forecast this morning.

A forecast by the Met Office shows Britain is in for a sudden downpour tomorrow morning, which will continue in the south-east on Tuesday

After the driest September since records began, Autumn will finally strike Britain tomorrow with fierce storms, 70mph winds and driving rain set to lash the north-west

The torrid conditions are expected to cause floods and disrupt travel, with the Met Office issuing severe weather warnings for parts of England, north Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland

The fog will not cloud farms in the north-east tomorrow, with storms set to strike just before tomorrow morning's rush hour, causing chaos for commuters

Early birds in Northumberland and parts of Somerset and London were covered in the thick mist, which quickly dispersed as the sun rose
