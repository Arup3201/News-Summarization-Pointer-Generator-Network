Kevin Pietersen claims he could yet return to international cricket - if ECB chairman Giles Clarke departed the scene.

It is a fanciful scenario to suggest Pietersen, sacked by England eight months ago, could resume his career with his adopted country under any circumstances such is the vitriol contained in his autobiography, which went on general sale on Thursday.

But he has escalated his grievances to the very top in his latest interview to promote his book, in the Evening Standard.

'What would have to happen for me to be recalled by England?' he asks.

'Clearly, the boss would have to go.'

Pietersen, who has already been highly critical of some of his former team-mates and former team director Andy Flower in his book and in earlier promotional interviews, hints he is aware of a possible change of guard.

'Clarke would have to go, and I've been hearing that could happen in the next few months,' he said.

'That's all hearsay, you never know. If there is a change at the top, there is potential, but we will wait and see.'

It was Clarke who presided over the South Africa-born batsman's reintegration into the England team at an eerie press conference alongside Pietersen in Colombo in 2012,

That came after a three-month exile imposed on him for sending 'provocative' text messages about his own captain Andrew Strauss to members of the South African opposition during a home Test series.

Pietersen is equivocal about where the power lies at ECB.

'Giles pulls a lot of strings,' he added.

'In terms of cricket, I believe Andy Flower pulls a lot of strings too. He has Giles Clarke in his pocket.'

An ECB spokesman declined to comment on Pietersen's latest remarks.

KP: The Autobiography includes Pietersen's account of a culture of 'bullying' in the dressing room under Flower's regime and orchestrated largely by Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann and Matt Prior.

The  batsman has dominated the headlines all week and seemed to be enjoying the limelight on Thursday

One of his grievances is the belief that certain former England team-mates were involved with a Twitter account called 'KP Genius', which sought to poke fun at the batsman.

Alec Stewart (above) said on Wednesday night that he had been told three England players had access to a Twitter account parodying Pietersen

Former England captain Alec Stewart revealed on Wednesday night that he was told by the owner of the parody account, Richard Bailey - an acquaintance of Broad's - that Swann, Tim Bresnan and Broad all held the password to it as well.

Stewart said he immediately informed the ECB about these allegations. Bresnan responded on Thursday morning, writing on Twitter that he did not have a password and was not involved in anything posted on the account.

Swann denied any involvement too earlier this week, and Broad did so in an ECB statement in August 2012 - a fact soon reiterated by a spokesman for the governing body, who said: 'Alec Stewart raised concerns in the best interests of English cricket.

'It was investigated immediately. We dealt with this two years ago.'

The matter was brought to a close back then by Broad's statement via his employers, released two days before the final Test of three against South Africa at Lord's. Pietersen was omitted from that match because of the mobile messages he had admitted sending about Strauss.

Broad's statement at the time read: 'Following last night's statement by Mr Richard Bailey that he was responsible for creating a parody Twitter account in Kevin Pietersen's name, I would like to confirm that I had no involvement in this whatsoever.

'I met with the managing director, England Cricket, Hugh Morris this morning and assured him that I did not play any role in the creation of this account or provide Mr Bailey with any information regarding Kevin Pietersen or the England team.

'As has been widely reported, Mr Bailey is a friend of mine - but we had no conversations regarding this issue at all, and I am pleased that he has now decided to close the parody account down.'

Stewart's conversation with Bailey took place during the first Test at The Oval in July 2012.

At the end of Broad's statement on August 14, Morris added: 'Having discussed this matter with Stuart, I am fully satisfied that he acted in a professional manner at all times and did not breach any confidences regarding fellow England players.

'ECB also accepts the apology Mr Bailey offered last night to the England team via his Twitter account and his reassurances that no professional cricketers were involved in the creation of this site.'

Bailey has subsequently reiterated that fact.

Pietersen traces many of the controversies of the latter stages of his record-breaking England career to the 'horrendous' breach of trust and loss of respect he felt on being told his own team-mates were behind the parody account.

He sets that context of disillusionment against the storm which erupted soon afterwards over the messages he sent about his captain.

His reinstatement allowed him to become England's leading runscorer, and to play some of his finest innings. But in February, on his return home after the 2013-14 Ashes debacle, the ECB announced he was no longer part of the national team's plans.
