West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa have made enquiries about signing Tottenham midfielder Etienne Capoue on loan.  

The 26-year-old France international has also been the subject of interest from Sevilla and Real Sociedad this week and is thought to be considering his options in a quest to secure more regular first-team football.  

Capoue's omission from Spurs' last match-day squad against West Brom at The Hawthorns on Saturday will have no doubt compounded the player's frustrations.

Midfielder Capoue has played just 36 games in all competitions over two seasons for Tottenham 

Capoue signed for Tottenham from Tolouse in 2013 for a reported fee of £9 million. 

However, he has failed to nail down a starting spot under successive Spurs bosses Andre Vilas-Boas, Tim Sherwood and the incumbent Mauricio Pochettino.
