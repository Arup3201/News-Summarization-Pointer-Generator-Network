Tim Cook took over the company shortly after Steve Jobs died of cancer in October 2011

Apple chief executive Tim Cook has told climate-change deniers they should not buy shares in the company.

Cook, 53, who took over the company shortly after Steve Jobs died of cancer in October 2011, was giving a talk at the 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders when he made the remarks.

The National Centre for Public Policy had called for Apple not to put money in green energy projects which are not profitable.

However, Cook said Apple did 'a lot of things for reasons besides profit motive' adding: 'We want to leave the world better than we found it.'

He said: 'If you want me to do things only for ROI (return on investment) reasons, you should get out of this stock.

'When we work on making devices accessible to the blind, I don't consider bloody ROI'.

Since becoming Apple's chief executive, Cook has increased the use of solar, wind and geothermal resources used to power the company's offices to more than 75 per cent.

He has also donated millions of dollars of Apple's money to charity.

Pledging to improve conditions for workers in China where iPhones and iPads are made he said: 'We believe that workers everywhere have the right to a safe and fair work environment.'

Last month Cook revealed that the rumours about Apple's vaulted privacy are true and they do hide their new products from employees using blacked-out windows and hidden rooms.

'There's black drapes and numerous locked doors and many other things,' Cook said Friday.

'We believe fundamentally that people love surprises.'

They also take precautions to make 
sure that anything that does make it out from behind the locked doors 
stays within the building as employees are forbidden from talking to 
their families about what they are working on.

The Apple CEO said that he also personally reads hundreds of emails from customers each day.

'This is a privilege,' Cook said of receiving emails from users.

'I get probably seven or eight hundred and I read the majority of those. Every day.

'I'm a workaholic, which helps,' saying that he wakes up at 3.45am every morning.
