A distraught Michael Clarke showed incredible strength reading a statement on behalf of the Hughes family, following Phillip Hughes' tragic death on Thursday afternoon.  

With his voice breaking and his head down, he read a tribute from the 25-year-old's parents, Virginia and Greg, his brother Jason and his sister Megan. 

Clarke was with the Hughes family at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney for 48 hours following his devastating accident on Tuesday afternoon.

Clarke thanked the hospital, his team mates and the general public for their support and wishes.

'We're devastated at the loss of our much loved son and brother, Phillip,' a composed Clarke read bravely, not looking up from the family's statement in front of him. 

'It's been a very difficult few days and we appreciate the support we have received from family, friends, players, Cricket Australia and the general public.

'Cricket was Phillip's life, and we as a family shared that love of the game.

'We would like to thank all the medical and nursing staff at St Vincent's Hospital and Cricket NSW medical staff for their great efforts with Phillip. - we love you.' 

'It's been a very difficult few days, we appreciate all the support we have received from family, friends, players, Cricket Australia and the general public.

'Cricket was Phillip's life and we as a family shared that love of the game with him,' Clarke continued.

'We would like to thank all the nursing and medical staff at St Vincent's Hospital and Cricket NSW medical staff for their great efforts with Phillip.'

Michael Clarke finished the statement with the simple yet powerful words, 'we love you.'

Immediately Clarke rose and left the media conference to rejoin Hughes' friends, family and team mates.  

The Australian cricket captain had a bond with Phillip Hughes that went far beyond team mates.

Choking back tears, Brukner made a special tribute to Clarke in Thursday's hugely emotional press conference, remarking that 'Phillip's family was obviously going through a difficult time, but I'm not sure they could have coped without Michael's assistance'

Clarke was the first player at Hughes' bedside after his catastrophic accident, suffered while the batsman played in round four of the Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and New South Wales in Sydney. 

Clarke arrived at the hospital at 3.50pm on Tuesday afternoon, just 20 minutes after Hughes was taken into St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney in a critical condition, travelling by ambulance from the Sydney Cricket Ground.

The Australian captain has barely left the hospital, leaving after midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday nights and returning first thing in the morning on both days. 

On Wednesday night, Clarke left the hospital with his arms around his wife Kyly Clarke and former team mate Justin Langer in a warm embrace. 

They leant their heads in towards each other silently following another day without improvement from their beloved mate.

Hughes and Clarke were close friends, with the cricket captain's wife Kyly calling Hughes their 'little brother'

On Tuesday evening, Kyly Clarke described Phillip Hughes as her 'little brother'.  

'It will be hard to smile tonight for @dancingau as my thoughts, my hearts and prayers are with my little brother Phillip Hughes and his family. Pls pls all say a prayer for him,' she said.

It was only fitting that Australia captain Michael Clarke was the first cricketer to see Phillip Hughes on his last day on earth.

Clarke was the first cricketer to arrive at St Vincent's at 6.20am on Thursday.

He had been like Hughes' older brother - someone to rely on.

Clarke was there for him again at the end. A fact Australia's team doctor, Peter Brukner, knew all too well.

Choking back tears, Brukner made a special tribute to Clarke in Thursday's hugely emotional press conference.

'There is one person I would like to pay particular tribute to and that is Australia captain Michael Clarke. Phillip's always been like a little brother to Michael,' Dr Brukner said.

'Phillip's family was obviously going through a difficult time, but I'm not sure they could have coped without Michael's assistance.

'I was just enormously impressed at the work that he did and the genuine care and love he gave to the Hughes family.' 

Phillip Hughes was expected to take injured Michael Clarke's position in the Australian international side for the upcoming test against India, set to commence on December 4.
