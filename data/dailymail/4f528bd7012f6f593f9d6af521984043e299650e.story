Essex Police today confirmed an investigation has been launched into the circumstances that led to the dog's death.

'Baron has been paired with his handler for the last four years and while working together they have made many arrests.'

Superintendent Steve Johnson said: 'This is a very sad occasion.

'As a former member of the dog unit myself, I know the strong bond between a police officer and his dog.

'Whilst they are working dogs, they also become a close and important member of the police officer’s family.'
