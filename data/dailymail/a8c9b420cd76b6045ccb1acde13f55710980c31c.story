The school's motto is: 'Proper Planning Promotes Success; Failure Is Not An Option!'

And the principal is now practicing what she preaches, having been demoted from her position over an issue with a poorly spelled sign.

Antoinette Young of Patterson School Number 20 in New Jersey has been reassigned as assistant principal of a different school after angering the local school district.

A member of the board noticed that Young - whose salary is $108,000 a year - left up the noticeboard and its shocking errors for over a week.

Back to class: The entrance sign of Patterson School 20 in New Jersey misspelled December as 'Dicimber', report as 'reepor' and a '1' was facing backwards for over a week. The principal has since been demoted

The sign misspelled December as 'Dicimber', report as 'reepor' and a '1' was facing backwards. 

'At first I didn't believe it,' Paterson Board of Education Corey Teague told CBS New York.

'I thought it was Photoshopped or something.'

'How can we expect our children to learn how to spell when the administration can't?' 

'We must be held to a higher standard.'

'We can't assume because it's an urban district — inner-city — that things like this can be swept over.

'If it were a suburban neighborhood, parents would be outraged.'

Angry: Local school district member Corey Teague saw the sign on Facebook and thought it was a prank

It is not known what school Young has been moved to.

She is still listed as the principal of Patterson School 20 on its website.

NorthJersey.com reported there were 'other reasons' for her demotion.

Young was reportedly under a 'Corrective Action Plan' designed to address shortcomings in her performance.

A school custodian was in charge of the sign and is believed to have been responsible for the mistake.

Gaffe: The school has said the sign was looked after by a custodian and not here an entrance used by staff

The school said the sign is at an entrance of the school the staff don't use, so the gaffe wasn't immediately noticed.

About 465 kids go to the school.

Some of the parents aren't happy with the decision about Young, saying it doesn't take into account what great work she has done with and for the students. 

'We’re sad to see her go,' mom Linda Martinez told CBS.
