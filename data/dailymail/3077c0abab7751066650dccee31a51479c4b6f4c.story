Britain accused Argentina of becoming ‘fanatical’ about its demands for the Falklands yesterday after the country’s foreign minister refused to meet islanders.

Foreign Secretary William Hague invited counterpart Hector Timerman to a meeting when he visits London next week to discuss issues relating to the islands.

But Mr Hague was snubbed on the grounds that members of the Falkland Islands government, which Buenos Aires refuses to recognise, would also be present.

Escalating the years-long war of words over the sovereignty, Mr Timerman said in a curt letter that he was sorry that Mr Hague 'can't meet without the supervision of the colonists from the Malvinas'.

He added: 'It's a shame that you reject a bilateral meeting. You need not keep trying to put together meetings during my visit to London. Leave that job to our own efficient embassy.'

Representatives of the Falkland Islands government, which Argentina does not recognise as legitimate, had hoped to tell Mr Timerman that Buenos Aires should respect islanders' rights and leave them in peace.

The vast majority of the 3,000 odd 
Falkland islanders want to remain under British rule and are expected to
affirm as much in a referendum due to be held in March.

The United Nations regards the dispute over the islands which Argentina knows as the Malvinas as a bilateral issue between Buenos Aires and London, he said.

Mr Timerman has now invited Mr Hague 
to meet with him in Buenos Aires, where he said 'my fellow foreign 
ministers can freely meet with whomever they wish without being 
pressured or having their presence conditioned on meetings that they 
haven't asked for and don't interest them'.

Strong opinion: Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has 
been very outspoken about the Falklands and has demanded negotiations 
with Britain

Argentine president Cristina 
Fernandez de Kirchner has 
been increasingly outspoken about the Falklands in recent years and has demanded negotiations 
with Britain 
despite the opposition of the islanders.

Earlier this month, she had an advert published in British newspapers claiming that Argentina had been stripped of the islands in 'a blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism'.

Prime Minister David Cameron has repeatedly insisted the residents of the Falklands must decide their own future and a referendum on the islands' political status is to be held in March.

In a statement released before Mr Timerman turned down the meeting, the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands stressed that their representatives, Dick Sawle and Jan Cheek, would not be 'negotiating any deal'.

'Rather we are anticipating a full and frank exchange of views,' the assembly said.

'Indeed we look forward to giving Mr Timerman some very direct messages on the unacceptability of Argentina's actions against the Falkland Islands in recent years.

'We demand that our rights be respected, and that we be left in peace to choose our own future and to develop our country for our children and generations to come.

'It is only right that he should hear this directly from us, as well as from Mr Hague.'

The statement went on to cite Britain's opposition to 'any negotiations over the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until the Falkland Islanders so wish'.

'The Falkland Islands Legislative Assembly believes that the result of the forthcoming referendum will demonstrate definitively that we do not. Should the issue of sovereignty be raised at the meeting, it will not be discussed,' it said.

'Members of the Legislative Assembly made it clear in their letter of 2012 to President Fernandez de Kirchner... that the Falkland Islands Government is willing to meet with the Government of Argentina in order to make our views clear, and to discuss matters of mutual interest including fisheries and communication.'

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We are aware that Argentine foreign minister Hector Timerman is due in the UK next week, and have invited him to come to the Foreign Office to meet the Foreign Secretary and representatives of the UK Government and the Falkland Islands Government.'
