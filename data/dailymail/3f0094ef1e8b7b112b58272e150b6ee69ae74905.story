Bishops have agreed that married gay couples can ask for special prayers in the Church of England after their wedding.

But, under new guidelines released today, the Church's House of Bishops has said that gay priests will be banned from getting married despite the fact it becomes legal in the UK next month.

One CoE vicar, who got engaged to his partner of 14 years yesterday, has today insisted the ban will not affect him and he will go ahead with his plans despite the potential consequences.

The new 'pastoral guidance' comes despite the fact rules allow for those in civil partnerships to become priests and bishops if they claim to be celibate.

And the rules state that gay non-clergy who marry can continue to receive communion within the Church.

The CoE will not be carrying out same-sex weddings, but gay couples can ask for special prayers from their priests. This, though, cannot be referring to as a 'blessing'.

They must have a form of 'pastoral discussion', but the priest may not subject the couple to 'questioning' about their private life.

They
 say that it would be inappropriate ‘conduct’ for deacons, priests and 
bishops to enter same-sex marriage. And lay members who do so will be barred 
from ordination.

In the guidance, the House of Bishops said that clergy should be allowed to ‘argue for a change in its teaching and human sexuality’.

But it added: ‘Getting married to someone of the same sex would, however, clearly be at variance with the teaching of the Church of England.  

‘The declarations made by clergy and the canonical requirements as to their manner of life do have real significance and need to be honoured as a matter of integrity.’

The CoE said it was not allowing ‘those who are in a same sex marriage to be ordained to any of the three orders of ministry’.

It said: ‘In addition it considers that it would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same sex marriage, given the need for clergy to model the Church’s teaching in their lives.’

The prohibition of gay marriage for priests could lead to a rebellion from clergy who choose to marry after the Same-Sex Marriage Act comes into force next month.

Local bishops would be forced to discipline them, effectively defrocking them for tying the knot.

According to the Telegraph, the Church is already preparing for ‘martyrs’ ready to challenge the rules.

One man who has vowed to marry despite today's guidelines released by the House of Bishops is Andrew Cain, vicar at St Mary's church in Kilburn, North London.

He yesterday proposed to his boyfriend, Stephen Foreshaw, for Valentine's Day.

‘I woke up thinking, great I’m engaged. And then I saw these new guidelines,' he told MailOnline.

'It is irritating. But it is not going to change anything. People will get married and then they will have to decide what they will then do.'

Mr Cain, 50, and Mr Foreshaw, 40, have been in a relationship 14 years and the vicar decided to propose ahead of the Same-Sex Marriage Act next month.

He said the new guidance makes the Church 'even more of a laughing stock' and described those who passed the rules as 'bullies'.

Mr Cain revealed that he and others had been told that they had the support of the Church, and were not expecting the guidelines to be released.

‘To treat them like this publicly is dreadful. All of the bishops will know one [a gay priest]. They are  telling people in private "we support you" and then publicly saying the opposite,' he said.

'It is absolutely shocking. On one level they are doing what the Church did to women in the past.'

He said that when he gets married, it will be expensive and complicated for the Church to discipline him.

Mr Cain said he would expect to get a formal letter - a monition - acting as a public rebuke from the Church, but was not sure what would happen beyond that.
