One determined woman lost 50lbs in seven months so that she could attend her 50th high school reunion wearing the 50-year-old dress she adored as a student.

Carol Highsmith, a 68-year-old photographer based in Tokoma Park, Maryland, who stands at 5ft 1in and weighed 175lbs at her heaviest in February, was desperate to show up to her September reunion as svelte as she was when she was 18. 

She created her own plan of attack, which she dubbed the 'WWW' lifestyle, according to CNN, and consists of simply 'walking, water and watching what I put in my mouth.'

Like many women, Ms Highsmith had for years squirreled away the clothes that didn't fit her any more - the 50-year-old dress included - but could never bring herself to get rid of them entirely.

'I had wonderful, pretty dresses and slim pants that were put away... as I continued to gain weight and hated myself for it,' she told the publication.

But something about the upcoming reunion forced her to drag those clothes out of her closet and re-assess her health, her weight, and her wardrobe.

Emboldened to reach her goal and lose 50lbs, she prophesied: 'I will not need to buy a thing. I will just go upstairs and pull out lots of attractive outfits that I have longed to wear for years.'

Her path to success was not easy, especially at the beginning.

Ms Highsmith, who travels a lot for work, was formally accustomed to gas station snacks and had no problem throwing back 'five Krispy Kreme donuts in one sitting.'

'Two candy bars and I am in another zone!' she recalls of her sugar-guzzling days.

'It is like I have taken a drug. My mood changes. I am tired, I think negative thoughts and I hate myself for eating bad things.'

As her youthful metabolism inevitably slowed over the years, Ms Highsmith, who is married, gradually piled on the pounds. 

Her health had nosedived and so had her mood.

For years, she avoided tucking her shirt in so as to mask the weight gain, and eventually settled into an existence of stretchy polyester pants.

But once she had made her choice to fit into that dress again, nothing could sway her from her path.

Ms Highsmith educated herself on healthy eating and vowed never to consume anything that wasn't good for her body from then on. For breakfast, according to her research, this meant fruit, poached eggs and ham, with coffee and milk.

She made a point never to eat lunch out of habit, only when she was truly hungry; after which she would munch on sugar-free low-fat yogurt, fruit and nuts, or a fresh salad.

Dinner was grilled fish with sweet potatoes and vegetables. During the time, Ms Highsmith was travelling extensively around America on a work project, so avoiding the rows of sugary treats at every pit stop was tough.

To stave off cravings, she carried with her a selection of unsalted nuts, and as an absolute last resort, a can of baked beans.

She still stopped off at Cracker Barrel chains along the road, but eschewed the fried, fatty foods and gravies for fresh grilled catfish with a baked sweet potato.

Drinking enough water - 5 to 6 bottles per day, cold, to burn more calories - was key too, as was a good deal of walking; 10,000 steps and 10 flights of steps a day.

Even when Ms Highsmith was staying in motels and had little time for exercise, she would trudge the halls and stomp up and down the staircases in order to reach her daily goal.

Ms Highsmith credits her Fitbit, a wearable device that tracks activity level, and My Fitness Pal, an app which logs calorie intake, for keeping her on the straight and narrow.

'Every day, no matter what is on my plate - figuratively rather than calorically speaking - I have walked my steps, drunk my water, and not touched sweets. Not one,' she said a few months into her new WWW regime.

The hard work paid off. 

On September 17, Ms Highsmith attended her Minnehaha Academy reunion in Minneapolis wearing the dress she had worn when she was 18.

And her mission has not yet drawn to a close. Ms Highsmith plans to lose 20 more pounds by her birthday - another major milestone - in May 2015.

'I trust this story will be an inspiration to others who are determined to lose weight – no matter what their age,' she concludes.

'Yes it’s hard, I’d say to them – no getting around it – but so very worth it.'
