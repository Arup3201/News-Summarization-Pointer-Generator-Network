Prince Charles led the Welsh Guards in the final rehearsal for this year’s Queen’s Birthday Parade today.

As Colonel of the regiment trooping its colour this year, the Prince of Wales was present and inspected the troops on Horse Guards Parade in central London.

The Colonel's Review is the final dress rehearsal before the Trooping of the Colour which will be held next Saturday in front of the Queen.

Dress rehearsal: Prince Charles gives a salute during the Colonel's Review on Horse Guard Parade in London today

Honour: It is the turn of the Prince of Wales' regiment, the 1st Battalion the Welsh Guards, to troop their colour this year

Family tradition: A member of the Royal Family usually attends the Colonel's Review but Prince Philip will remain in hospital after undergoing surgery

Prince Philip, Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, is unlikely to be present this year due to his recent admission to hospital for abdominal surgery. He is expected to remain in hospital for up to two weeks.

This year, the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards are trooping their colour on Horse Guards Parade for the first time since 2008.

The official birthday of the Sovereign is
 marked each year by a military parade and march-past, known as Trooping
 the Colour. The 
troops participating in the parade are drawn of fully trained, 
operational troops from the Household Division.

The Queen's Colour of a battalion of Foot Guards is 'trooped' - carried 
along the ranks - each year before the Sovereign. Only one colour can be 
trooped at a time, and the five Household Regiments - Grenadier, 
Coldstream, Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards take their turn each year.

Tradition: British forces' Household Cavalry ride outside Buckingham Palace on their way to the Horse Guards Parade

Practice makes perfect: The official birthday of the Sovereign is marked each year by a military parade and march-past, known as Trooping the Colour

Royal pomp and ceremony: Members of the Guard march along the Mall while participating in the Colonel's Review

Missing out: Prince Philip, Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, is unlikely to be present this year due to his recent admission to hospital for abdominal surgery

The ceremony derives from two old military ceremonies, Trooping the 
Colour and Mounting The Queen's Guard. The origin of the ceremony goes 
back to the early eighteenth century, and possibly even earlier, when 
the guards and sentries for the Royal Palaces and other important 
buildings in the capital were mounted daily on the parade ground by the 
Horse Guards building.

A feature of guard mounting was for the colours of the battalion to be 
carried (or 'trooped') slowly down the ranks so that they could be seen 
and recognised by the soldiers.

Origins: The Trooping of the Colour dates back to the 18th century when the guards and sentries for the Royal Palaces and other important buildings in the capital were mounted daily on the parade ground by the Horse Guards building

After the Trooping ceremony on Horseguards’, the Royal Family will make their way back to Buckingham Palace where shortly after, the extended Royal Family will appear on the balcony.

Her Majesty has never missed a Trooping the Colour as Sovereign, though one was cancelled in 1955 due to strike action. The Royal Family travel to Horseguards’ in carriages and those members of the Royal Family who’re on parade as Colonels of the regiments of Footguards, ride on horses on parade.

Other members of the Royal Family watch the parade from the Horseguards’ building from the Duke of Wellington’s old office, overlooking the parade ground.
