A bullied schoolboy left a heartbreaking goodbye letter to his mother telling her: 'I can't cope any more' just before he died of a suspected overdose.

Simon Brooks, 15, died in hospital four days after writing the note, which also blamed bullies for making his life a misery.

His bereft mother Julie Brooks, 48, today said Simon had been picked on for 18 months and dreaded going to school in Pontyclun, South Wales.

Tragedy: Schoolboy Simon Brooks admitted 'I can't cope any more' in the days before his death

She said: 'He wrote a goodbye letter in the notes of his mobile phone and it said: "I can't cope any more".

'He was being pushed about, having his bag grabbed and subjected to verbal abuse.

'He loved the lessons and had a lovely group of friends, but he wasn't being left alone at break times and lunchtimes.'

Simon was found collapsed eight days ago at his family home in the village of Tonyrefail, near Pontypridd, South Wales.

Police are investigating the family's claims that Simon was being bullied at Y Pant Comprehensive School.

His mother said: 'He told the ambulance man who had took him to hospital: "I'm being bullied".

'Every Sunday night he would beg me not to send him to school.

'During the school holidays he would count the days and hours until he had to go back.

'He was so brave he used to go every day and try to stick up for himself.

'In the goodbye note he wrote for me he didn't name a name or blame anyone.

'If he was here he wouldn't want blood and revenge - he's just want peace.'

Organic food supplier Mrs Brooks said Simon had 'clearly planned' his apparent suicide.

The mother-of-five was at his bedside at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff where he died on Tuesday four days after taking tablets.

She said: 'It was the worst four days of my life watching my darling child suffer and die.

'You can't imagine the searing pain of losing a child unless you have lost one.

'Simon was a sunshine child. He was so delightful, deep, sensitive and analytical.

'A part of me is gone forever and my life will never ever be the same without him in it.

'The love we shared will help warm the dark days ahead for us without him.'

Mrs Brooks said Simon had been bullied at his previous school in Treorchy, South Wales, where he was allegedly assaulted on a train on the way to school.

However Simon did not want to press charges.

His mother said Simon had been punished for taking wine into school nine months ago to 'numb the pain of the bullies'.

She said Simon didn't want to complain to the school authorities because he felt it

would only make things worse.

Mrs Brooks and husband David wants lessons to be learned from Simon's death and has met with the school's headteacher Mark Powell since her son died.

She said Mr Powell and his staff had been 'trying very hard' but schools were under pressure from government and were 'under the microscope'.

Pupils staged a demonstration at the school in support of Simon and his family on Thursday afternoon - chanting his name in the playground.

Police were told of the protest but a spokesman said it was dealt with by the school.

A spokeswoman for Rhondda Cynon Taff Council said: 'Pupils wore purple on Wednesday as a mark of respect for Simon.

'Counsellors and educational psychologists have been at the school advising pupils, and parents were also being given support and grief guidance.'

Headteacher Mr Powell said: 'We are all shocked and saddened by the death of Simon Brooks and our thoughts and sincere condolences are with his family and friends at this tragic time.

'We at the school and its wider community are struggling to come to terms with his sudden death and our main focuses at this time are to respect the wishes of his family and to support those pupils who have been affected.'

The school's website says: 'We take every allegation of bullying very seriously at Y Pant and have a zero tolerance approach where we find bullying has occurred.'

A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'We are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident which at this stage is not thought to be suspicious.'

Simon's death has been reported to the coroner and an inquest will be held.
