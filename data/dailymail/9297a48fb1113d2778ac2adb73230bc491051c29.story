By naming mothers the victims can be identified, which is illegal

Peaches Geldof is facing a criminal investigation for tweeting names that may identify victims of paedophile rock star Ian Watkins.

A court order was made to grant lifelong anonymity to two children whose mothers allowed Watkins to abuse them.

But yesterday Miss Geldof, daughter of Boomtown Rats singer Bob, broke the order by naming their mothers to her 161,000 followers on Twitter.

In trouble: Peaches Geldof is facing a police investigation after she tweeted the names of women who helped Ian Watkins abuse their babies

Rant: The celebrity's series of tweets have been deleted, but this grab shows how she ranted about the 'sick, horrible women'

Prolific: In a less contentious tweet, Miss Geldof also commented on a magazine feature where she says Watkins was compared to the Child Catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

The Attorney General said a possible criminal offence had been committed. South Wales Police are investigating.

Only 24 hours previously, Miss Geldof had been lecturing the Press about invading people’s privacy.

Naming
 the mothers could lead to the identification of the children, which is 
why the court called them only Woman A and Woman B. Lostprophets singer 
Watkins was branded a ‘determined and committed paedophile’ after he 
pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a string of sex offences, including the 
attempted rape of a baby.

Warning: The Attorney General's office has now tweeted to say that tweeting the names could be a criminal offence

The 36-year-old, from Pontypridd, South Wales, plotted the abuse with the two mothers in text and internet messages.

Yesterday
 morning Miss Geldof, 24, ranted to her followers: ‘The papers MUST name
 “woman A & B” who offered up their babies to this monster.’

Facing questions: Peaches Geldof tweeted the names, but they were later deleted

When
 no newspaper took up her suggestion, she decided to publish the banned 
details herself, after reportedly reading them on a US-based website.

She tweeted: ‘The names are...’ and wrote both mothers’ full names, before adding: ‘what sick, horrible women’.

Miss
 Geldof was warned by fellow Twitter users that her actions were in 
breach of a court order, to which she replied: ‘How???’ It is understood
 the message remained online for four hours before it was deleted. 
Twitter users branded her  an ‘idiot’.

Last
 night a spokesman for Attorney General Dominic Grieve said: ‘We 
understand that the names of the co-defendants in the Ian Watkins case 
were posted online but have now been removed.

‘As has been previously reported, the co-defendants were the mothers of the victims.

‘Victims
 of sexual offences have automatic lifetime anonymity and the 
publication of names or information which  can lead to their being 
identified is a criminal offence. This is a police matter.’

Detective
 Chief Inspector Peter Doyle, of South Wales Police, said: ‘We are 
currently in consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service regarding 
the matter and will take action if appropriate.’

Only
 a day earlier, Miss Geldof was taking the moral high ground over the 
Press, accusing newspapers of being ‘intrusive’ for reporting the court 
proceedings concerning Nigella Lawson’s alleged drug-taking.

Watkins was dated Fearne Cotton (pictured together in 2008) and Alexa Chung

She
 tweeted: ‘It’s at times like this that I wish that the press would not 
intrude into celebrities’ private lives on this degree. Did we learn 
nothing from the phone hacking scandal?’

She
 apparently failed to appreciate that the court case involving Miss 
Lawson is open to the public and is being widely reported on all media 
outlets.

The judge even 
took the unusual step of encouraging the media to apply for all 
reporting restrictions to be lifted – and then granting that request.

By
 contrast, the judge in the Watkins case made certain there were 
restrictions in place on what could be reported, which were 
automatically adhered to by the professional journalists covering the 
court.

Miss Geldof, who has
 two young sons with rocker husband Thomas Cohen, works as a journalist,
 writing columns for The Daily Telegraph and Elle Girl and articles for 
The Guardian.

It is not known whether she has ever had any training in media law.

Under
 the Contempt of Court Act 1981, the maximum sentence for the offence is
 two years in prison.

Miss Geldof’s agent said there was no comment to 
make.

James Baines posted a picture purporting to be James Bulger's killer Jon Venables as an adult

A Twitter user who posted 
pictures purporting to be of James Bulger's killer Jon Venables as an 
adult was yesterday given a 14-month suspended prison sentence.

Security
 guard James Baines was handed the sentence, suspended for 15 months, at
 London's High Court for a flagrant contempt of court.

Baines, who is from Liverpool and close to the Bulger family, will also have to pay £3,000 in costs.

He admitted disobeying a January 2001 injunction binding on the whole world which prohibits the publication of any information alleging to identify the appearance, whereabouts, movements or new identities of Venables or Robert Thompson, who were convicted of the two-year-old’s murder in November 1993.

One image showed Venables in a school photograph as a child while below and alongside were different images of an adult male.

They were accompanied by the tweet: 'Its on bbc news about the jon venables pic on twitter saying its been removed eerrm no it hasn't.'

It was the first time the Attorney General had brought contempt proceedings involving the use of social media; however, a number of high-profile cases have seen people fined for breaking the law on Twitter or Facebook.

Nine people have been ordered to pay compensation to the woman raped by footballer Ched Evans for naming her online.

Last month Speaker’s wife Sally Bercow issued a grovelling apology to Tory peer Lord McAlpine after libelling him on Twitter at the High Court to draw a line under her comments on Twitter.

posted a defamatory tweet wrongly implicating him in a child sex scandal

The 43-year-old agreed to pay £15,000 in damages, which will be donated to the Chelsea Pensioners, and has been left with a six-figure legal bill.

The libel arose following a BBC Newsnight programme last November over the abuse of young boys at care homes in Wales. It alleged that ‘a leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years’ had been involved.

As speculation raged over his identity, Mrs Bercow posted on Twitter: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*’

The allegation was without foundation and Lord McAlpine announced that he would pursue those who libelled him. The peer agreed a £185,000 settlement with the BBC and £125,000 with ITV.
