A senior executive at the New York Times has broken ranks to suggest former BBC chief Mark Thompson is not fit to be her new boss in the wake of a paedophile scandal which has rocked the corporation to its core.

In an extraordinary intervention, Margaret Sullivan questioned the integrity and ability of the man who was director general when a report that would have exposed Jimmy Savile as a predator who targeted young, vulnerable girls, was axed.

Writing in a blog post yesterday, the public editor, who works on behalf of readers and writes about the newspaper itself said: 'How likely is it that [Thompson] knew nothing?'

'His integrity and decision-making 
are bound to affect The New York Times and its journalism - profoundly. 
It's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, 
given this turn of events.'

It has been Mr Thompson's assertion 
that he knew nothing about the allegations against the late presenter 
until last month after he had left the BBC.

But his statement was today questioned by one of the corporation's respected foreign correspondents Caroline Hawley.

Public Editor Margaret Sullivan wrote in her blog:

'How likely is it that he knew nothing? A director general of a giant media company is something like a newspaper’s publisher... publishers usually don’t know about editorial decisions — unless they are very big ones, fraught with legal implications. 'His integrity and decision-making are bound to affect The Times and its journalism — profoundly. It’s worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, given this turn of events.'The Times might start by publishing an in-depth interview with Mr. Thompson exploring what exactly he knew, and when, about what happened at the BBC.

'What are the implications of these problems for him as incoming Times chief executive? What are the implications for the Times Company to have its new C.E.O. – who needs to deal with many tough business challenges here – arriving with so much unwanted baggage?'

She
said she believed she told Mr Thompson, who is due to take up his post 
at the New York Times next month, about the 'broad context' of the 
investigation into Savile, who died last year at the age of 84,

Ms Hawley said she voiced her concerns about the cancellation of the report, which would have aired on the BBC's flagship current affairs show Newsnight, at a Christmas drinks party last year.

The investigation had been scheduled to run in November - but was pulled at the last minute.

She told The Times in London: 'I 
think I must have mentioned the broad context of the investigation but 
genuinely don’t remember the words I used.'

Contradiction? BBC foreign correspondent Caroline Hawley today said she thought she had told Mr Thompson of the 'broad context' of the corporation's Newsnight investigation into Savile

Mr Thompson, director general at the BBC from 2004 until September, said he only learned 
about the planned documentary at the party Ms Hawley told him: 'You must
be worried about the Newsnight investigation.'

He said he did not ask for any more details, but made informal enquiries from BBC News the next day
and was told that the programme had been dropped for 'journalistic 
reasons'.

The 55-year-old added that he did not ask what 
allegations against Savile were being investigated, and only found out 
about them almost a year later after he had stood down from the BBC.

Mr Thompson's spokesman yesterday
told The Times: 'The clue to the strength of your story may be [Ms 
Hawley's] words "I think".'

He also issued a 
statement saying there were 'no inconsistencies' between his 
recollection of the conversation and a statement Ms Hawley has given to a
BBC review into the decision to cancel the Newsnight programme.

Scandal engulfed the BBC earlier this month after a rival broadcaster ITV aired a documentary which accused Savile of being a paedophile who had abused hundreds of young victims in hospitals, schools and even on the corporation's premises.

But even as the documentary went out, it emerged that Newsnight had carried out its own investigation - including an interview with the same victim - nearly a year before.

A team spent six weeks investigating allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in Surrey, south-east 
England, speaking to at least four women who claimed they had been assaulted or knew about events at the school.

The report was shelved at the last minute at the request of the programme's editor Peter Rippon.

It was not until this week that the BBC aired its own investigation into the scandal, put together by documentary strand Panorama.

The show covered both Savile's crimes and the corporation's reaction. In the wake of broadcast, Peter Rippon stood aside from his Newsnight role after the BBC said his explanation for shelving the story had been 'inaccurate or incomplete'.

On Wednesday, new director general George Entwistle was grilled by MPs in parliament. He denied the the broadcaster helped cover up allegations that Savile preyed on women.  

The BBC has now launched two inquiries into the affair; one will address Savile's actions and how he went undetected during his six decade career and a second which will examine why the Newsnight report was pulled.

Revered: The New York Times prides itself on a reputation for quality, serious journalism

Meanwhile pressure grew on his predecessor Mr Thompson, who left his £622,000 post at the BBC earlier this year.

The New York Times tapped Mr Thompson
in August as CEO - a role that had been vacant for eight months after 
the company ousted its former CEO Janet Robinson last year. It is understood that he will take up his post at the New York Times on November 12.

He received a $3million (£1.8m) 'sign-on bonus' and is set to receive a $1million (£620,000) annual salary, with a potential $1million bonus. He also stands to be paid a further $3million bonus, paid over three years, for meeting 'long-term objectives'.

One Wall Street analyst called 
for the paper to delay Mr Thompson taking over the company, 
adding more pressure on executives to address the matter on the 
company's earnings conference call tomorrow.

'The New York Times should delay 
[Thompson's] start date until there is more clarity,' said Doug Arthur, 
an analyst with Evercore Partners who follows the New York Times.

'It seems to me he will have to 
attend a hearing in the UK parliament. That is going to be a 
distraction. It's unfortunate. It's an unexpected complication.'

Mrs Sullivan declined to comment further on her blog as did the New York Times.

As public editor and a representative
of readers, she writes about issues affecting the newspaper independent
from News York Times management, including chairman and publisher 
Arthur Sulzberger Jr and executive editor Jill Abramson.

Since stepping into the role in 
September, Mrs Sullivan has already made waves including a post that 
criticised the paper's decision not to publish on the front page a story
about a congressional hearing into attacks on a U.S. consulate in 
Benghazi, Libya, last month in which four Americans were killed.
