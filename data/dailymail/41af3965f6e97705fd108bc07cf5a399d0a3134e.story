A former accountant has been convicted of threatening to kill an IRS agent and rape and kill the agent's wife over a $330,000 tax bill.

Andrew A Calcione of Cranston Rhode Island was found guilty on charges of threatening to assault and murder an IRS agent and his family in federal court on Friday, and now faces up to 20 years in prison.

The 49-year-old was arrested for leaving two disturbing voicemails on his IRS agent's work phone, after receiving the news that he owed thousands in taxes.

Calcione's statements are made even more bizarre by the fact that he worked as a tax preparer for several years.

Tax bill: An IRS agent was investigating Calcione at the time of the threatening calls, and estimated that the 49-year-old owed an additional $330,000 for 2008, 2009, and 2010 filings. Pictured above golfing in a photo posted on Facebook

Calcione's IRS agent was investigating his tax forms from 2008 to 2010 and estimated that he owed an additional $330,000.

In April 2013, Calcione and his ex-wife Patricia were asked to sign a form allowing extra time to assess their case. Calcione signed the document, but his wife did not, spurring the agent to leave a voicemail on Calcione's cell phone asking about the form the following July.

Three days later, an infuriated Calcione left a threatening voicemail on his agent's work phone and a transcript of part of the message was revealed in court papers.

'The next time you think you want to f****** call me up … don’t. ‘Cause the next time you do, I’m not going to answer. I’m just going to show up where you live,' Calcione says. 

He goes on to threaten the agent's life and that of his family.

'Matter of fact, I’d shoot you in the f****** knee caps, tie you to a f****** chair, gag ya … and then f*** your wife in front of ya, and then blow her f****** brains out in front of ya and maybe kill your f****** kid...'

'So you can deal with that. Do not f****** call me again. I don’t bother you. Don’t f****** bother me.'

The second voicemail was Calcione telling the agent to ignore the prior message.

'Disregard my previous voicemail. I was f****** around with my daughter,' the message said, according to the agent.

After receiving the threatening calls, the agent reported Calcione to the police.

In the course of their investigation, Calcione changed his story three times and first said the message was intended for his ex-wife. 

He then told authorities he meant to call his daughter, and changed his story a final time to say he was talking to himself in the car and must have accidentally rung the agent with his hands-free calling system.

According to public records, Calcione was a partner or president of a tax-prep firm for several years, though he is no longer registered as an accountant on CPAverify.

Calcione could face up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced on September 11.

U.S. Attorney Peter F Neronha says his office is seeking 'the toughest, appropriate sentence in this case.'

'The vast majority of Americans understand the payment of their federal taxes is part of their civic responsibilities.  A very small number do not, and an even smaller number not only refuse to pay their taxes, but engage in the kind of outrageous, threatening, and frankly bizarre behavior involved here,' Neronha added.
