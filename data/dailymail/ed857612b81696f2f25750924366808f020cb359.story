Being granted big, shiny accolades can be a double-edged sword in a town as demanding as Miami.

The beautiful Setai in the city's South Beach area has been billed as 'the best hotel in Miami' for several years running and its restaurants are regularly hailed as some of the East Coast's finest, so our expectations were understandably high as we arrived at The Restaurant.

One of two eateries at the hotel, The Restaurant has recently undergone a major menu overhaul with Executive Head Chef Mathias Gervais now overseeing an entirely Mediterranean offering after years of the place being known as a the hottest pan-Asian destination on SoBe.

It was a risk taken to appeal to the tribes of monied South Americans now holidaying in the Florida beach town. And while the seasonal European menu is a bit at odds with the Asian decor and ambience the food is fabulous enough to pull off this delicious global mash up.

The Restaurant is just minutes away from the neon margarita bars of Ocean Drive, but elegant design touches like the mother-of-pearl bar and Art Deco screens imported from Shanghai lend the place a serene and grown-up atmosphere while the dark wood and red lighting throughout keeps things sexy enough for date night.

After settling in with a signature Chilli Passion cocktail (the best cocktails here still have an Asian flavour) my date and I were taken through a menu that was more South Italy than South Beach, complete with fresh black and white truffles all the way from Alba (the smell was so good we forgot to worry about the carbon footprint).

I had mentioned that my better half was a vegetarian when booking and staff at the Setai were prepared with menu recommendations and a specially made amuse-bouche.

The menu follows a traditional Italian format: primi, pasta, secondi and - of course - dessert, and questions about all dishes are encouraged as diners watch the chefs prepare everything around a gleaming La Plancha grill.

To start, for him, a plate of local heirloom tomatoes and figs was packed with flavour and finished with a perfectly sticky balsamic glaze. For me, as the non-veggie, it was my duty to try the duck foie-gras which came with crushed Amaretti biscuits and was decadent and delicious.

Being bad euros we skipped the secondi instead doubling up on truffle for our pasta dishes choosing the truffle risotto, with extra white truffle, and the fragola and pancetta pasta, with extra white truffle (this is entirely allowed when holiday dining).

A punchy passion fruit soufflé with fresh coconut ice team came next (homemade ice cream and sorbet flavours change daily) and we finished the meal with another chilli-infused cocktail.

Our only gripe was the music, which was too loud and too 'Eurotrash' for such an elegant setting. But this is Miami, where ear bleeding 'doof doof' to accompany a few hundred dollar dinner bill is the norm so instead of moaning we toasted the DJ with another Chilli Passion as we tried to soak up the romance of the hotel's stylish outdoor pools.

And then another one as we passed the bar on the way home.
