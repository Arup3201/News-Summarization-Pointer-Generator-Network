An animal shelter will be monitored by the government for the next three years after questions were raised about the conditions of its facilities and the number of animals being euthanised.

The Lost Dogs Home, in Melbourne, was the subject of recent audit by the Victorian Government, and will now be forced to report on its euthanasia rates twice a year.

An investigation into the shelter discovered minimum standards were not being met in some cases, and animals were sleeping on cracked concrete floors or shelters that were too small.

The cracked floors mean disease is more likely to be spread as the grounds are not sealed, and some of the cat enclosures were also found to be below size. 

The Lost Dogs Home provides services to 17 councils across Victoria, according to the audit authorised by Jaala Pulford, Agriculture Minister, from a number of different locations.

Ms Pulford said more focus needed to be put on the home's assessment process for whether animals should be put down.

The report uncovered that some conditions, such as cracked concrete floors, were not up to scratch

The size of the cages where cats were being held were deemed too small 

'We will work to ensure all issues raised in the report are addressed and issues of non-compliance put right,' she told The Age. 

Despite the home reducing its overall euthanasia rates in recent years, it was found they did not keep records which detailed the health, sociability or temperament of the animals that were put down.

The formal investigation into the shelter was launched in January, after strong social media campaign, The Age reported. 

Victorian Agriculture Minister Jaala Pulford announced the investigation on social media following a strong response from the community.

On Sunday the Lost Dogs Home issued a statement of their own, welcoming the report.

'The Lost Dogs’ Home welcomes the audit report released today by Jaala Pulford MP (Agriculture Minister) into our compliance under the Code of Practice because every cat and dog at the Home is cared for with compassion,' the statement, posted to their Facebook page, read.

In the post they announced a $250,000 upgrade, which would go towards: 'operational infrastructure improvements, prioritising customer and animal contact areas and animal assessment facilities.'
