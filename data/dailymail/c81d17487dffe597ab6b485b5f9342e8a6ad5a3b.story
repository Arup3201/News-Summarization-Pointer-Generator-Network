The whereabouts of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych is still unclear a day after he left the
capital

The whereabouts of ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych is still unclear a day after he fled the capital Kiev. 

A plane with Mr Yanukovych on board was denied permission to take off on Saturday evening from Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine which was en route to Russia, the State Border Guard Service said.

The president's spokesman said on Sunday morning that even he does not know where Mr Yanukovych is.

New acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the State Border Service had detained some of Yanukovych's armed guards in the incident when he sought to fly to Russia from Donetsk.

The service had 'prevented the departure of an unidentified aircraft', he said.

'The president's bodyguards were inside. They had failed to pass the required security clearance and were detained.

'President Yanukovych emerged from the aircraft, got in a car and left in an unknown direction.'

Two senior Yanukovych officials also evaded arrest after a shootout in a VIP lounge at an airport, he said.

An probe is now underway into how former tax minister Oleksandr Klymenko and ex-prosecutor general, Viktor Pshonka fled.

Avakov said: 'Klymenko and Pshonka were prevented from boarding a flight at an airport yesterday.

'Armed men broke into the VIP lounge, fire was exchanged, after which Klymenko and Pshonka drove off. An inquiry is under way.'

Meanwhile, former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko was freed from prison and returned to Kiev to address a massive crowd.

The Kiev protest camp at the centre of the anti-Yanukovych movement was calm but still full of dedicated demonstrators on Sunday morning after a day that saw a stunning reversal of fortune in a political stand-off that has worried the US, Europe and Russia.

Ukraine is deeply divided between eastern regions that are largely pro-Russian and western areas that widely detest Mr Yanukovych and long for closer ties with the European Union (EU).

Mr Yanukovych's shelving of an agreement with the EU in November set off the wave of protests but they quickly expanded their grievances to corruption, human rights abuses and calls for his resignation.

The political crisis in the nation of 46 million has changed with speed repeatedly in the past week.

First there were signs that tensions were easing, followed by horrifying violence and then a deal signed under Western pressure that aimed to resolve the conflict but left the unity of the country in question.

Protester self-defence units who have taken control of the capital peacefully changed shifts on Sunday. 

Helmeted and wearing makeshift shields, they have replaced police guarding the president's administration and parliament and have sought to stop radical forces from inflicting damage or unleashing violence.

Thousands of Ukrainians roamed the suddenly open grounds of the lavish compound outside Kiev where Mr Yanukovych was believed to live.

The house has been closed off to the world for nearly a decade.

Inside they discovered the scale of opulence the 63-year-old built around him.

The property in Mezhyhirya, an hours drive from Kiev, has a golf course, helicopter pad and is situated in a country where the average salary is less than £300 a month.

Below the house, a garage is filled with classic sports cars worth millions, while in the exotic gardens Australian and African ostriches stretch their legs.

Parliament, which he controlled the previous day but is now emboldened against him, voted to remove him and set elections for May 25.

But Mr Yanukovych said in a televised address that he now regards the parliament as illegitimate and he will not respect its decisions.

Ms Tymoshenko, whose diadem of blond peasant braids and stirring rhetoric attracted world attention in the 2004 Orange Revolution, was both sad and excited as she spoke to a crowd of about 50,000 on Kiev's Independence Square, where a sprawling protest tent camp was set up in December.

Sitting in a wheelchair because of a back problem aggravated during imprisonment, her voice cracked and her face was careworn.

But she praised the protesters who were killed this week in clashes with police. 

'You are heroes, you are the best thing in Ukraine!' she said of the victims.

The Health Ministry said the death toll in clashes between protesters and police that included sniper attacks had reached 82 dead over the last week. 

The protesters put that figure at more than 100.

She urged the demonstrators not to yield their encampment in the square, known in Ukrainian as the Maidan.

Mr Yanukovych's authority in Kiev appeared to be eroding by the hour and suspicions mounted that he was trying to get out of the country.

His support base crumbled further as a leading governor and a mayor from the eastern city of Kharkiv fled to Russia.

A plane carrying Mr Yanukovych tried to take off on Saturday evening from the eastern city of Donetsk but did not have the proper documentation so was turned away, Oleh Slobodyan of the State Border Guard service said.

The president was driven off in a car from the airport, he said.

Mr Slobodyan said there has been no record of Yanukovych leaving Ukraine by land, and it was not clear where the plane was headed.

Mr Yanukovych spoke on television on Saturday in Kharkiv and accused his opponents of a putsch.

'Everything that is happening today is, to a greater degree, vandalism and banditry and a coup d'etat,' he said.

'I will do everything to protect my country from breakup, to stop bloodshed.'

EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton welcomed the release of Ms Tymoshenko as 'an important step forward in view of addressing concerns regarding selective justice in the country'.
