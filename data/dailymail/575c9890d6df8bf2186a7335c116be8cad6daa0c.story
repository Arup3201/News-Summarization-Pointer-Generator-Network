Two families who have teenage sons with the same name were both told that their child was seriously injured in a horrific car crash after a police mix-up.

The families of Tyler Allen Weisgarber, 18, and Tyler Adam Weisgarber, 17, only discovered the mistake when they met each other in hospital - and were forced to identify the injured teenager.

After the car crash in Canton, Ohio at 2.30am on Sunday, highway patrol troopers notified Tyler Adam's family that he was in the hospital, while medical staff contacted Tyler Allen's family.

It was in fact Tyler Allen who had been injured; Tyler Adam returned home in the early hours of Sunday - but by that point, his family had already rushed to what they believed was his hospital bed.

Mix-up: Tyler Allen Weisgarber (left) suffered a collapsed lung, bleeding on the brain and a broken vertebrae in a car crash - but authorities also told the family of Tyler Adam Weisgarber (right) that their son was hurt

His mother Connie was awoken by Ohio Highway troopers hours after the crash, and officials told her that her son was at Mercy Medical Center.

After she rushed to the hospital with her daughter Jessica and Tyler's grandfather Tom, she was told that her son had suffered bleeding on the brain, a collapsed lung and a broken vertebrae.

'I couldn't believe it was happening to our family, like unreal,' Jessica told Fox8.

As the family tried to come to terms with the devastating news, another man walked into the room and introduced himself to doctors as 'Tyler Weisgarber's dad' - Doug Weisgarber.

It dawned on the family what had happened: 'Holy mackerel, there's two Tyler Weisgarbers,' Tom said.

Shock: Tyler Adam returned home shortly after his family left for hospital but assumed they were still in bed

Relief: His sister Jessica said they were relieved he was OK - but that their thoughts were with the other family

Jessica added: 'We knew of another Tyler Weisgarber, but when a cop shows up at your house, you donâ€™t second guess him... Then it hit us that, oh my God, it might not be our Tyler.'

Her mother and Tyler Adam's father Doug went to the victim's bedside to identify him.

'I knew as soon as they opened the door and I saw Tyler's head,' Doug told the Canton Rep. 'His head was still dirty, but I knew it was my Tyler.'

Connie said, 'It's not my son' and broke down in tears as she hugged Doug.

'We hugged for quite a while,' said Doug. 'I was happy for her, and she was sorry for me.'

He added that he had been sure the boy in the bed was his son, as nurses had notified them of his accident after finding his cell phone and dialing 'Mom'.

Confusion: Both teenagers shared the same initial, lived in neighboring towns and were the same age - they are both pictured at their senior proms before graduation. Tyler Allen, left, missed his due to his injuries

Tyler Adam, who had been at a high 
school graduation party and stayed with a friend, had returned home only
about ten minutes after his mother left to go to the hospital.

He assumed she was still asleep so 
went to his room, showered and watched television. He then received a 
call from his sister saying they were at the hospital.

'I'm like, "What happened? What 
hospital? Where do I have to be?" and before I could even say any of 
that, she says "for you!",' Tyler Adam told Fox8.

Tyler Adam said he was angry that 
his family had to go through the mix-up, but they said they are not 
upset at authorities and are simply asking people to pray for the other 
family.

Tyler Allen remains in the Intensive Care Unit, but his condition had been upgraded to stable.

Authorities are still investigating the crash, and another investigation is underway to learn how the mix-up occurred.

The crash occurred when Corey Wagner,
19, lost control of his vehicle and drove off the right side of the 
road in Canton, flipping the car in the early hours of Sunday.

Wagner was throw from the vehicle and was taken to Aultman Hospital where he was treated for minor injuries. Another passenger fled the scene but was also later treated for minor injuries.

Alcohol is believed to have been a factor in the crash, according to the police report.

Sue Weisgarber told the Canton Rep her son was the only one wearing a seat belt.
