Justice for Audrie: the parents of 15-year-old Audrie Pott have started a petition to have the three teenagers who sexually assaulted and drove her to suicide expelled from school 

The parents of Audrie Pott, the 15-year-old California girl who was driven to suicide after being sexually assaulted and bullied, have started a petition to have the three boys who attacked their daughter expelled from school.

The trio of teenagers, whom the Daily Mail is not identifying because they are minors, pleaded guilty in January 2014 and were sentenced to 30 to 45 days each in a juvenile detention facility.

Pott, from Saratoga, California, hung herself September 10, 2012 - just eight days after the teens digitally penetrated her at an alcohol-fueled Labor Day party and took pictures of her in a compromised state.

The 15-year-old girl felt humiliated after she discovered that the cellphone photos showing her naked body covered in lewd comments written in marker had been shared with students at her school.

On Wednesday, the Pott family launched a petition on the site Change.org calling on the principals of Saratoga High School and Christopher High School to expel the three perpetrators responsible for Audrie’s 'slut-shaming.’

‘It is important to note that the crimes committed against Audrie would have resulted in rape charges in many states, specifically Tennesse [sic] with the Vanderbilt case and Ohio with the Stubenville case,’ the petition reads. ‘But not in California. The criminal charges and identities of her assailants were protected by the juvenile justice system in place in California.’

The family’s plea states that Audrie's parents have persistently urged school officials to expel the teenage boys, but according to the family, 'no disciplinary actions have been taken against these students by their high schools.'

The petition goes on to say that the young men in question allegedly did not learn their lesson, as evidenced by the fact that at least two of them 'continued to "slut shame" other minor female girls by disseminating nude and semi-nude pictures of them.'

According to the Pott family, allowing Audrie’s tormentors to continue attending class sets a bad example to other students, who may get the impression that such behavior will be tolerated.

‘Because of their actions, Audrie will not be able to graduate from high school, and her assailants should not have the honor of walking across that stage either,’ the online appeal concludes.

The petition was addressed to Christopher High School Principal Paul Winslow and Saratoga High School Principal Paul Robinson.

As of early Friday morning, nearly 18,500 people have signed the family’s school expulsion petition.

At a party in early September 2012, Audrie Pott drank alcohol-laced Gatorade and woke up without her shorts on, with her face painted black and with mocking comments written in indelible marker all over her body.

Over the course of the next week, Audrie learned that cellphone photos had been taken of her during the assault, which involved digital penetration, and shared with students at the school she attended with the three attackers.

'My life is over...I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' Audrie said to a classmate in the days following the incident.

The principal of Christopher High School was also named in the plea posted on Change.org

She then pleaded with the boys to delete the photos.

'I swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.'

Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.'

Eight days after the attack, on September 12, 2012, Audrie hanged herself in a bathroom at her mother's house.

In addition to the criminal charges, the Potts have filed a civil lawsuit against the teens they say are responsible for their daughter's suicide.

Shockingly, one of the boys convicted of assaulting Pott is claiming that the girl's parents share some of the blame in their daughter's tragic death.

In police interviews, the teenagers admitted to coloring half of her face black with marker, then pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals.

They photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days later, scores of students had seen the images.

Rolling Stone magazine has revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom she had known since middle school.

She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images.

'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.'

'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body.

She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her.

'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.'

She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.'

When she returned to school, she missed classes to avoid people and had an argument with one of her closest friends, Kathy Atabakhsh, who accused her of becoming a different person.

'She had been, literally, the best person you could meet – always honest and trustworthy,' Kathy told Rolling Stone. 'And I was so upset that she had changed. It was hard for her to hear that from a close friend.'
