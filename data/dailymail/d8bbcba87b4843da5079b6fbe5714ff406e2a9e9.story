No young person wants their parents following them on social media, and Deion Sanders Jr. discovered firsthand why it is such a bad idea this week.

The talented wide receiver, who is a sophomore at Southern Methodist University, wrote on Twitter Thursday; 'Gotta get the hood doughnuts almost every morning. If my doughnuts don't come in a plain white box, I don't want them!'

Then, seeing this tweet, dad Deion Sanders decided to have a little fun with his son, and give him a piece of his mind, writing back; 'You're a Huxtable with a million $ trust fund stop the hood stuff! Lololol. Son. #truth"

A huxtable is a phrase used by some to refer to upper class black people.

Sanders, who won Super Bowls with both the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers while also managing to play in the 1992 World Series with the Atlanta Braves, currently works as an analyst for NFL Network and CBS and is said to be worth around $40million.

His son seems to reap the benefits of this wealth too, and enjoys showing off his luxury clothing items on his social media accounts.

And just in case anyone was unsure as to whether or not the entire think was just a joke, Sanders wrote on his Twitter account later; 'For all of Yall who are wondering what's going on with me and my son @DeionSandersJr I love him 2 life and we're just messing with yall.'

As for his son, he also wanted to make something very clear to his father, writing back; 'I still love the hood's doughnuts.'
