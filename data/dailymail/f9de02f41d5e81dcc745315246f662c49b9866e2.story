Bill Clinton's controversial couplings has reached a new level after he was pictured spending time with prostitutes at a recent charity event.

The former President was in Los Angeles on Thursday and photographed with two female attendees who work as legal prostitutes in Nevada.

Identified as Ava Adora and Barbie Girl by TMZ, both of the women are known to work at the Bunny Ranch brothel near Carson City.

Clinton, who infamously faced impeachment after having an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky while he was still in the White House, is seen grinning ear to ear while posing with the two women.

They attended the event with Bunny Ranch owner Dennis Hof and porn star Ron Jeremy.

The Bunny Ranch was first opened in 1955 and is legally licensed in the state.

The brothel owner also runs the Loce Ranch which is located just a mile away from the original Bunny Ranch.

Other looks: Both Barbie Girl (left) and Ava Adora (right) have bio pages on the brothel's website

On her Love Ranch profile, Ava Adora describes herself as a 23-year-olf originally from San Diego.

'Beyond
 my physical attributes, I know I can make a great friend, intellectual 
and funny companion, and passionate lover,' she writes.

Hamming it up: Bill Clinton also spoke at the event and posed for a selfie with Demi Lovato in a relaxed moment

Barbie Girl is far more explicit in her bio page, telling how she specializes in throwing de-virginizing parties.

'I bring my flexibility skills into the bedroom for some crazy fun sex positions and get offs,' she writes.

The photo was reportedly taken at the Unite4:Humanity event held in Los Angeles on Thursday in the ramp up to Oscars weekend.

Clinton gave the event's keynote address while also receiving the 'Unity Award' as presented by Forest Whitaker.

The prostitutes weren't the only ones who snagged a photo with the flirtatious former President.

He also took a selfie with Demi Lovato who later shared the photo with her 21 million followers.

'Too excited to filter this... NO BIG DEAL - #Selfieswiththeprez.... @billclinton - so nice to meet you!!!!' she wrote.

When it was his turn to say a few words, Clinton paid tribute to one of his own heros.

In his address, Clinton mentioned the positive influence of the late Nelson Mandela.

He also joked that he was the warm-up act for Sean Penn, who later presented De Niro with the creative commitment in film award and Clear Channel president John Sykes the media social visionary award.
