A British man accused of murdering his girlfriend has been freed after 11 days of 'hell' in a Kenyan jail.

Carl Singleton, 41, from Millom, Cumbria, has been released without charge pending an inquest into the death of student Ashley Agumbi, 22.

He was arrested on November 23, on suspicion of having flushed the insulin for her diabetes down the toilet.

Miss Agumbi died in hospital of diabetic hypertension and respiratory failure days after making accusations against Mr Singleton.

He flew out to be with her six months ago, after they met on Facebook.

Mr Singleton said he'd lost two stone during his time in prison, surviving on a bowl of porridge a day.

Kenya Police said he is 'free for now' after he appeared in court in front of magistrate Hannah Kaguru on Wednesday December 3.

He described the ordeal in which he slept on the jail floor as 'hell'.

He said: 'I was just shocked at first when I was arrested. I was in jail for 11 days that was hell, had to sleep on the floor, just one drink a day and one meal a day. Conditions were hell.

'You sleep on the floor and the jail was so dirty. No shower for 11 days or a shave.'

The 6ft 6in, 20-stone former van driver said: 'I was not given much food just ugali (a dish of maize flour cooked with water to a porridge). I lost about two stone in 11 days.'

He also said he was only allowed to use the phone once to call his family.

He said: 'I was just upset because I lost the love of my life. But I had to stay strong for my family back home.

'We were so much in love with each other.'

He said of the accusation: 'It felt bad when she was my world, my life, my everything.'

He also said when he met her he 'knew it was love'.

He added: 'I was so happy when I saw her at the airport. As soon as I saw her I knew she loved me.

'She was a very kind and caring young lady.'

Divisional criminal investigation officer for Gigiri, Nairobi, police senior superintendent Daniel Kandie said: 'The matter will be further investigated by the court with an inquest.

'He has been released by the court pending the inquest. He has been released without charges. For now he is free pending the outcome of the inquest.'

Finding love online: Singleton met Agumbi six months ago, after they met on Facebook

His brother Steven Singleton, 21, of Market Street, Millom, said a 'huge weight' had been lifted off the family's shoulders.

He said: 'If anything it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off of all our shoulders. Good to finally get some positive news. Just can't wait for him to get home now really.'

Mr Singleton met his girlfriend Ashley Agumbi online through Facebook two years ago before flying out with a tourist visa to meet the University of Nairobi student six months ago.

Miss Agumbi, who was studying at Lower Kabete campus in the University of Nairobi, is said to have died in hospital following an alleged incident on November 19.

Mr Singleton is due to fly back to the UK early next year.
