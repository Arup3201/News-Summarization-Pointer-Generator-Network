A man has been fined £250 for leaving rubbish in the alleyway behind his house because he claims the council failed to give him a wheelie bin. 

Kyle Tatton said he had nowhere to put his household waste for five months after Stoke-on-Trent City Council failed to provide him with a bin.

The 24-year-old claims he told his local authority about the matter in October 2014 but only received a wheelie bin earlier this month.

He had argued that during those five months he had no alternative but to dispose of bin bags at the back of his home in Cobridge, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.

However, the council disagreed and said they had delivered the bin as soon as they could, and Kyle was hauled before magistrates charged with fly-tipping.

Yesterday at Stafford Magistrates' Court he admitted the charge and was fined £35, ordered to pay £200 costs and a £20 surcharge.

'I told the council I hadn't got a wheelie bin in October and they said I would have to dispose of the rubbish,' he said today.

'I haven't got a car to take it to the tip. What was I meant to do with it? I had no alternative but to leave it in the alley at the back of my house.

'They only got me the bin just before I went to court so it would look better for them. It's a disgrace.'

The court heard Stoke-on-Trent City Council had received complaints about black bin bags, cardboard and blankets piling up in the alleyway.

Correspondence found inside the bags linked the waste to Tatton, who was interviewed last October.

He admitted to officers that he had put out the waste but said it was only because he did not have a wheelie bin. 

The council said that a request for a bin was only logged in February.

Councillor Andy Platt, the city council's cabinet member for green enterprises and clean city, said: 'Our records show we received Mr Tatton's request for a bin in February this year and delivered the bin in March.

'We receive hundreds of orders each month for new or replacement bins; we delivered the replacement bin as soon as possible given the number of requests we deal with.

'Not having a wheelie bin is not an excuse to dump rubbish outside your property, and we welcome the conviction, fine and costs imposed by the court.

'Dumping rubbish in the open, even in bags, can quickly bring down the appearance of an area and lead to other problems, including vermin and further fly-tipping.'

Steven Pritchard, chairman of Portland and Century Residents' Association, added: 'The council does seem to be cracking down on dumped rubbish but why should anyone have to wait weeks for a wheelie bin?'
