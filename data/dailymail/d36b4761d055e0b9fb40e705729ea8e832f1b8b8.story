FA chairman Greg Dyke will not return the £16,000 watch he was given as a gift from FIFA at the 2014 World Cup, but intends to donate it to charity.

The 67-year-old knows he must pay £3,000 tax on the watch whether he keeps it or not, and Dyke revealed he will auction the controversial gift for Breast Cancer Care.

'I am not going to send it back to the FIFA ethics committee as they have requested,' Dyke said, reported by ITV.

'I've now been told that I've got to pay £3,000 VAT on this watch regardless of whether I send it back or not.

'So I've decided instead to pay the VAT and give the watch to this year's FA charity.'

FIFA executive committee member Michel D'Hooghe recently described the £16,000 watches given to officials at the summer's World Cup by the Brazilian federation as the most 'poisonous present' he has ever received.

The ethics committee of FIFA last month demanded all the watches were returned.
