Mother-of-one Sabrina Moss, 24, died in August last year in north London as she celebrated her birthday

A teenage drug dealer who is accused of shooting dead a nursery teacher at her 24th birthday party has been described by his own barrister as a ‘low-life toe rag'.

Yassin James, 19, from Wembley, north west London, is accused of murdering mother-of-one Sabrina Moss in August last year on Kilburn High Road.

Two other men - Martell Warren, 22, of Kensal Green, and Hassan Hussain, 29, of Willesden Green, north west London - are also on trial for murder.

A fourth man, Simon Baptiste, 29, from Cricklewood, north west London, is accused of letting the alleged gunmen use his house as a base for the killing.

Addressing Old Bailey jurors today, James’ lawyer James Scobie QC said the teenager was a drug dealer who 'makes a good living' out of misery.

But he told the jury that this was a 'mile apart' from being a 'cold-blooded killer'.

He said: 'Yassin James didn’t try to lie to you about what he is. He is a toe rag.

'He is a low life drug dealer - Class A - who hands out misery to a lot of people and he makes a good living out of it.

‘A toe rag Class A drug dealer is a mile apart from a cold-blooded killer who pulled the trigger at point blank range.’

The alleged murder took place after the group of men had gone to Woody’s Grill on Kilburn High Road to buy burgers. They were seen on CCTV chatting and laughing together hours before the shooting.

The men then allegedly armed themselves with a MAC-10 submachine gun and a sawn-off shotgun.

Meanwhile, Miss Moss, who lived in Neasden, 
north west London, had been celebrating her birthday with friends at Love and 
Liquor club in Kilburn.

The young woman, who had a four-year-old son and worked at Alice's Wonderland nursery in Stonebridge, suffered a gunshot wound to the 
chest.

Sabrina Gachette, 24, and two other men, Mahad Ahmed and Edson Da Silva, were also seriously injured during the shooting.

The shootings took place on Kilburn High Street, north 
west London. Three of Miss Moss' friends were seriously injured and Miss Moss died from a gunshot wound to the chest

The court has previously heard how the 
shootings were the tragic result of an 'deep-seated' ongoing dispute 
between the alleged killers and a group from South Kilburn.

The prosecutor had told jurors that the men carried out the attack to show they would not be 'trifled with'.

Today, Mr Scobie accused his client's 
co-defendant Warren of lying to the jury.

He said he had a ‘love-in’ 
with the prosecutors as he tried to shift the blame.

He told the court Warren, who allegedly
 drove the gunmen to the scene, had fabricated a story to hide the fact 
that two of his friends had been killed in a tit-for-tat gang feud.

Mr Scobie said that Warren’s account of becoming a drug dealer after being involved in a motorbike accident was ‘pathetic’.

‘The truth is, and Warren knows it, that it’s called confess and avoid,’ he said.

‘Warren has jumped on the Crown’s bandwagon and there is a nice little alliance. His evidence is contrived.

‘Warren
 lied about this nonsense with his mates dying in a car crash - why not 
just say it how it is? They were executed.’

During the prosecution case, prosecutor Mark Heywood QC had told the court how the accused had allegedly stalked their victims before the shooting.

He said: ‘The August bank holiday 2013 last year will live forever in the memory of some and that’s exactly by design.

‘On one side of the road during the last minutes of a night out was a young mother partying with friends. They were laughing, chatting and some were standing smoking on the pavements.

‘On the other side of the road were men with hoods over their heads, likely in gloves, faces covered - two killers.

‘Behind
 them a car facing the wrong way up a one-way street, in that was a man 
who wanted it done just as much as they - ready to speed them away.'

Warren, Hussain and James deny murder, three counts of attempted murder, two counts of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and two counts of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.

Baptiste also denies conspiring to cause grievous bodily harm.

The trial continues.
