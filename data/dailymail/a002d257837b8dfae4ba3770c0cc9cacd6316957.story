A kindergarten teacher from Virginia pleaded guilty Tuesday in Franklin County to trying to have her ex-husband assassinated.

Angela Nolen, wearing an orange jail-issued jumpsuit, wiped away tears during the sentencing hearing in Franklin County Circuit Court. She pleaded guilty to solicit to commit murder.

Police say the 47-year-old Sontag Elementary School teacher paid an undercover state police agent $4,000 to kill Paul Strickler, 64, a retired school administrator. She planned to pay another $4,000 after her ex-husband was killed.

Court records show Nolen and Strickler were granted a divorce in December 2012.

Admission of guilt: Angela Nolen, a teacher at Sontag Elementary School in Rocky Mount, Va., pleaded guilty to hiring a hit man to kill her ex-husband Paul Strickler, 64. She accused him of abusing her and their daughter

Nolen had been scheduled to stand trial in July. She faces up to 40 years in prison when she is sentenced August 9.

Her attorney, David Furrow, said in court that he plans to call in a number of witnesses to testify on his client's behalf, Roanoke Times reported.

A
co-defendant, school nurse Cathy Bennett, 37, of Rocky Mount, has been 
charged with conspiracy for allegedly helping Nolen in her plot.

Bennett remains free after posting $75,000 bond in February. Her trial is set for July 15.

Nolen was arrested in February and charged
with solicitation to commit murder on her ex-husband, Paul Strickler. 
However, her plan unraveled as the kindergarten teacher hired an 
undercover state police officer.

The teacher told the man she believed
to be an assassin that her ex-husband posed danger to her and their 
child, and said she wanted 'something that would eliminate him from this
earth without me being in fear constantly.'

By all accounts, the couple's decade-long relationship had been a turbulent one, marked by allegations of infidelity and violence. 

Strickler told the paper that they were trying to work out plans so that Nolen could buy him out of their home.

After
Mr Strickler was alerted by state police that Nolen had allegedly put a
price on his head, he speculated that if he was dead, his ex-wife would
not have to pay him a dime for the house.

Nolen was granted full custody of their adopted 7-year-old daughter and 
later obtained an order of protection that barred the girl's father from
having any contact with her.

The
woman had initially approached a co-worker identified as Sharon 
Williams about her plan to have her ex-husband killed, and Williams then
called police and arranged for Nolen to contact Sgt. J.G. Blankenship, 
who called himself 'Greg,' The Franklin News-Post reported.

The law enforcement agent secretly recorded his February 19 conversation with 
Nolen, which the woman's attorney introduced this week as evidence.

The
transcript of the officer's chat with the woman reveals that Strickler 
had allegedly abused both her and their child, and she was afraid for 
her life.

‘I lay awake
at night with a knife in one hand and a phone in the other hand, 
listening for any sound,” Nolen says. ‘There’s a two-year protective 
order in place that doesn’t do me any good if he comes to my house in 
the middle of the night.’

On
the recording, 'Greg' proposes that Nolen pay him $10,000 for killing 
her husband but later settles on $8,000, asking Nolen to pay him half of
the sum upfront.

Nolen then leaves to go the bank and returns 20 minutes later with the money.

'Greg'
could be heard asking Nolen if she wants her former spouse 'really 
messed up' and aware that she was the one who had put the hit on him, 
but Nolen rejects the offer.

Throughout
their conversation, the undercover officer repeatedly reminds Nolen 
that once they agree on the terms of the contract, there will be no 
going back.

'You’re going to be able to live with this?' he asks her.

'Yes,' Nolen replies. 'I have a child who continues to have nightmares about daddy breaking in and killing mommy.'
