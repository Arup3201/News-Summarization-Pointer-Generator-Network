Four women who underwent womb transplants have had embryos implanted into them to try and get them pregnant.

Since 2012, nine women have received wombs donated by relatives in an experimental procedure.

The treatment is designed to test whether it is possible to transfer a uterus into a woman so she can give birth to her own child.

Hope: Four Swedish women who received transplanted wombs have had embryos transferred into them in an attempt to get them pregnant

The women had IVF before the transplant, using their own eggs to make embryos.

'We have already begun transferring 
embryos into four of the women and plan to make attempts with the others
 when they are ready,' said Dr Mats Brannstrom, a professor of 
obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Gothenburg, who is leading 
the research.

He would not say whether any of the women are pregnant. Of the nine who got transplanted wombs, two had to have them removed because of complications.

One previous high profile case was that of Derya Sert, from Turkey.

She has a womb transplant in August 2011 and subsequently conceived, but then miscarried after eight weeks of pregnancy.

dR Brannstrom predicted that three or four of the seven women might successfully give birth.

'One or two more will perhaps get pregnant and miscarry and one or two won't be able to get pregnant,' he said.

Dr Brannstrom said any woman who does get pregnant will be on a low dose of drugs to keep from rejecting the transplanted womb and will be monitored as a high-risk pregnancy.

He added that some women had received their new
 wombs from their mothers and there was a higher rate of complications 
with older uteruses.

Eight of the nine women who were given transplants suffer from MRKH syndrome, a congenital disorder which prevents the womb from developing, but means she still has intact ovaries which produce eggs.

This means a woman's egg could be fertilised outside of her body and the embryo then placed in her womb.

The ninth woman had her womb removed after suffering cervical cancer.

The development of womb transplants has given hope to thousands of childless women across Europe and at least 15,000 in the UK.

The method has been controversial though 
because it involves taking wombs from living donors. The Swedish team 
favours it because the organs are generally in better condition and a 
better immunological match.

But other surgeons in the same field do not believe it is right to put a living donor through such a major operation when it is not life-saving.

About one girl in 4,500 is born with MRKH, where she doesn't have a womb.

Dr Brannstrom said the transplanted wombs would be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies.

'Based on our previous work and animal studies, we are optimistic,' he said. 'But we cannot guarantee anything.'
