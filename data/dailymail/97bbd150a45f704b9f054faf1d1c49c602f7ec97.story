Disqualified drink driver: Jason Huxtable, 22, pictured arriving at court today, was jailed for six years after killing two of his friends in the late night crash

A disqualified drunk driver who killed two of his friends when he rolled a car down a bank tried to blame one of his friends for the crash as she lay dying next to the burning vehicle.

Jason Huxtable, 22, flagged down a passing lorry and tried to hitch a ride home without bothering to mention he had been involved in a serious accident.

Young mother Emma Kift, 21, died after being thrown out of the car during the crash while Johnny Popple, 23, was trapped inside as it burned.

The fire was so fierce that the vehicle was almost completely destroyed following the crash at Loxhore Cross, near Barnstaple in Devon.

Huxtable was jailed for six years at Exeter Crown Court today after admitting two counts of causing death by careless driving while over the drink drive limit.

After the crash the construction worker flagged down a passing lorry driver and attempted to get a lift to his home in nearby Bratton Fleming, the court heard.

It was only when the lorry driver refused to drive him that Huxtable informed him there had been a crash.

The defendant, who was twice the drink drive limit and had been banned 
from driving three months earlier, initially said Ms Kift had been at the wheel and showed little concern for his friends, the judge was told.

He eventually made a full confession to police following the crash in the early hours of June 1 last year.

The three friends agreed Huxtable should drive them to get food in Ms Kift's car because he was 'the most sober'.

But the car clipped a 
hedge, before 'fish-tailing' down the road and flipping down a bank as the driver sought to correct his vehicle. He had been driving in excess of
the 60mph speed limit.

Sentencing today, judge Mr Justice Burnett said: 'At the time of these awful events you simply did not believe the ordinary rules which apply to everyone else applied to you.

'Time and again young lives are lost as a result of the overbearing arrogance and stupidity of young drivers who believe that they are in some way immune to the effects of alcohol and run risks with their own lives and other people’s lives. The consequences of your actions are almost beyond description.'

Prosecutor Andrew Macfarlane said the car was completely destroyed in the crash with victim Mr Popple inside.

Mr Macfarlane said: 'The fire was so fierce that it burned virtually everything about it, including the tyres.

'Not a lot was left of the body of Mr Popple who perished in the car.'

Victim: Young mother Emma Kift, 21, who died in the accident near Barnstaple, Devon, last year

Killed: Johnny Popple, 23, was trapped in the vehicle as it burned, Exeter Crown Court was told

He said Ms Kift had always refused to wear a seatbelt because, the court was told, 'if her child died in a car accident, she didn’t want to live either'.

It meant the young mother was thrown from the car at some point before it burst into flames. She died from multiple injuries.

Mr Macfarlane said Huxtable had somehow managed to escape, flagging down a lorry driver and asking to hitch a ride towards his home.

He said: 'There’s no evidence at all that he tried to give any help to Ms Kift. (The car) is burning furiously, his first thought should have been to the fire brigade - never mentioned.'

Lee Bremridge, mitigating, said no custodial sentence would compare with his client having to live with causing the death of his friends.

He said: 'This is a tragic case. What 
Mr Huxtable did has led to the deaths of two friends of his on what were
dreadful circumstances.

'He
accepts full responsibility for what happened. Now aged 22, the events 
of the early hours of June 1 will live with him for the rest of his 
life.'

Mr Bremridge said his
client wasn’t trying to 'flee the scene' following the crash, but 
admitted that 'in hindsight' he should have told the lorry driver of the
seriousness of the incident.

The
judge said: 'This is an early attempt to try and shift responsibility 
for reasons which are frankly obvious. He’s a disqualified driver.

'To my mind the more serious aspect of it is trying to shift responsibility to Emma.'

Speaking outside court, family and friends of the victims echoed Mr Justice Burnett's sentiments about drink-driving.

Hazel
Kift, Ms Kift's mother, said: 'We are, and always will be, devastated 
by the loss of Emma and Johnny. Our grief and heartbreaking loss is only
compounded by the fact this tragedy could have been avoided.

'We hope drivers like Jason Huxtable take a look at this.

'There
can be no justification for where mothers and fathers should have to 
bury their children - where a 16-month-old little boy should have to 
grow up without his mummy.

'We would like to thank the community for their support.'

Following the sentence, a spokesman for the road safety charity Brake said drink driving is 'selfish.

'Death on the road is sudden, violent and utterly devastating for friends and families affected,' he said.

'Drink driving is selfish in the extreme, so it is vital there is an effective deterrent to stop them ruining others’ lives.'
