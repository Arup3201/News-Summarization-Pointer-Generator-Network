The Most Interesting Man In The World has proven he is not just interesting in Dos Equis commercials after revealing he saved the lives of two children when he was younger.

Jonathan Goldsmith, the white-bearded, gravel-voiced 75-year-old who parallel parks trains as the 007-style character in the beer adverts, told Esquire this week he once rescued a drowning girl and saved a boy who was having an epileptic fit.

He said, while working with disabled children at New York City charity The Fresh Air Fund when he was 18, he learned how to tell a child who was having a grand mal fit from a kid who was playing around.

'Years later, in Malibu, I watched a little girl play with all the kids, and something caught my eye,' he said. 'I just remember (thinking) "This kid is going to die. She's drowning."

He added to Esquire: 'But because I had been trained when I 
was 18 as a counselor, 20 years before the incident, I knew. I just 
instinctively reacted.'

He went on to describe how he saved the life of another child while on an overnight camping trip with a group of disabled children.

'It sounded like a hardware store walking down the railroad tracks, all these braces,' he said of walking to the camp with the kids whose disabilities ranged from muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, sick cell anemia and amputations.

'These kids were having a ball. And all of the sudden, I had this one kid, little bastard (laughs) would only take his epileptic medicine with apple sauce,' he said. 

'Well, we didn't have apple sauce, so he
wouldn't take his (laughs) f****ing medicine. And sure enough, there's 
Nathan screaming at the sky, and he drops like a stone. And he was a 
serious epileptic.'

Goldsmith recalled having to carry the child back on the railroad tracks.

'It was tough because they're spaced so I couldn't get a direct step, and my toe would hit the top of the railroad tie, my instep on the bottom,' he said.

'And to this day, I sometimes have to wear a night brace when I sleep, with ice and all the rest of it. And that was 55 years ago.'

Goldsmith said working with disabled children was 'going to be my life's work' until he got 'sidetracked.'

He has since returned to helping charities, however.

He said he just recently came back from Vietnam where he was working with an organization called Clear Path International, that helps those who have been injured by land mines, providing assistance with their education, with prosthetic limbs, and bereavement benefits.

'I'm 75 years old, so, you know, I'm quite aware of my mortality—or immortality— and I want to leave something behind,' he told Esquire.

'I don't want to just be here and leave no handholds for the future, no footprints. It's very, very important to me that the recognition that I have achieved as a so-called celebrity can be used to help others.'
