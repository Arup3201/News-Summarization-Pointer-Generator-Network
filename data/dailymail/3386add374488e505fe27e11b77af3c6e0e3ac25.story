Passengers set to depart on one of the world’s longest non-stop flights instead spent the night sleeping on a plane grounded by severe weather conditions at Dallas-Fort Worth airport.

The Qantas flight QF8 was scheduled to fly to Brisbane, Australia, at 10pm on Friday, but because of the recent frost spell, which has caused 11 deaths around the country, the plane was forced to return to the terminal and park at the gate.

The passengers were given the option to stay on the plane or to go around the terminal, but according to Qantas, due to the congestion at the airport from other cancellations, ‘many passengers chose to stay on board’.

The airport tweeted Saturday afternoon that about 400 departures had been cancelled so far that day.

Black ice affecting the roads surrounding the airport meant that authorities couldn’t transport passengers to the hotel rooms they had organized for everyone after the flight was cancelled, according to ABC News.

Passengers were provided with blankets as well as catering and entertainment such as movies while they camped out on the Being 747, airport officials said.

‘Qantas was able to obtain hotel rooms, but not transportation for its passengers,’ airport spokesman David Magana said.

‘They offered to the passengers the option to stay on the plane if that was more comfortable for them. Doors remained opened, passengers could get in and out as they wished.’

Many passengers did go back and forth between the plane and terminal, according to a tweet from DFW Airport, and were able to go to the hotel once the roads reopened.

The airport said it is prepared for the coming ice storms with ‘de-icing equipment and top-of-the-line snow plows’.

The roughly 17-hour flight from Dallas to Brisbane has been rescheduled for 11pm Saturday night.
