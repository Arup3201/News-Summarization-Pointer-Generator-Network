 A 40-year-old man drowned on Sunday night tying to rescue a six-year-old boy who fell into the Hudson River during a community cookout.

Several people, including Boyce Coleman, jumped into the river after spotting the boy, Stephan Jones, floundering in the water during a barbecue at JFK Marina in Yonkers shortly before 7pm.

Jones was quickly saved and brought to the shore, but Coleman struggled after helping the boy and was pulled under the surface.

Coleman was doing 'God's work', said a man known as FWT, who added that he was confident his friend was 'with the Lord'

Thelma Martin, mother of the boy who was saved, said she was grateful her boy was saved but saddened at the loss of a friend

'He loved life, he gave life,' friend William Van Buren told WABC. 'And he gave his life for a life.'

Dive units from Yonkers and the New York Police Department tried to rescue him but weren't able to recover his body for about two hours, according to WABC.

Coleman, who was known 'Scoop' to friends and family, was rushed to St Joseph's Medical Center but couldn't be revived.

Jones' mother, Thelma Martin, said she was grateful that her son is alive but heartbroken at the loss of a friend. 

'It's hard, because he went to save my son, but he didn't come back with him,' she told WABC. 'And it hurts. It hurts me.'

Several hundred people were reportedly at the marina when Jones fell in. The cookout was a reunion of the School Street Houses, the Yonkers apartment complex where Coleman grew up.

'He died doing God's work in front of everybody that he loved,' friend FWT said. 'So it hurts, but I feel confident knowing that he's with the Lord.' 

The boy was taken to St John's Riverside Hospital and is in stable condition. An autopsy on Coleman is planned for today. An investigation into the incident is ongoing.

'Unfortunately, one of the heroes became a victim himself,' Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano said at a news conference at the marina. 'My condolences to his family. We'll let the investigation unfold and see what we need to do moving forward.'
