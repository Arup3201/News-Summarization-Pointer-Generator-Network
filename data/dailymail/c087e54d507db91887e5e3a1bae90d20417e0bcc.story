A father-of-six who received a disability pension for 16 years has been ordered to repay $73,000 after it was revealed that he lied about his lucrative portfolio and impressive income.

Victorian man Peter Kooyoufas claimed a disability pension whilst owning ‘multiple’ properties, a collection of extravagant vehicles, collected ‘hundreds of thousands of dollars’ in rent and secretly ran a poultry business.

In April 2012, Centrelink ordered that Kooyoufas repay a portion of his pension after it was discovered he had purchased a poultry farm for $530,000 in Cranbourne South, 45 kilometres south east of Melbourne's CBD.

Kooyoufas made an appeal against the order to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but was unsuccessful after investigations uncovered many years of deceit.

Whilst receiving his disability pension, Peter Kooyoufas concealed his lucrative collection of cars,  including a 1971 Rolls-Royce

The man, who also goes by the name ‘Pangioti Kooyoufas’, has been fined three and a half year's worth of payments to the sum of $78,813.71

It was discovered that the man had operated 28 different bank accounts whilst he was on the pension from March 1996 until April 2012.

The man, who also goes by the name ‘Pangioti Kooyoufas’, has been fined three and a half year's worth of payments to the sum of $78,813.71.

This figure only accounts for the payments he received from Centrelink from November 2008 until his pension was cancelled.

The Administrative Appeals Tribunal found that Kooyoufas continually rorted the department from the time of his initial pension application in 1995.

"I have no hesitation on the evidence before me in finding that Mr Kooyoufas deliberately failed to disclose the ownership of (Mount Waverley) to Centrelink at the time of his applications in 1995 and 1996 for the DSP," AAT senior member Egon Fice found.

Kooyoufas' deceit  was first uncovered when the department were made aware that he had purchased a Victorian poultry farm for $530,000 and running it as a business

Kooyoufas’ claimed was that he was not the owner of many of the properties, nor was he running businesses.

He insisted the poultry farm belonged to his father, and that his involvement with chickens was a 'hobby'.

'The poultry farm was registered in his son’s name, but advertisements listed the contact name as "Peter",’ argued AAT senior member Egon Fice.

He told the AAT that the large number of cars believed to be in his possession, including a 1996 Mercedes-Benz, a 1971 Rolls-Royce and a 1988 Pontiac, technically belonged to his children

'Even if he did not sell many chickens or other birds, it is simply not possible, on the evidence for me, to say that the land was used solely for private purposes.'

He told the AAT that the large number of cars believed to be in his possession, including a 1996 Mercedes-Benz, a 1971 Rolls-Royce and a 1988 Pontiac, technically belonged to his children.

His 28 bank accounts frequently received rental payments, but Kooyoufas insists the properties belonged to his parents.
