The
 6ft 5in, 280lb bodyguard to the stars, who provided protection to Lady Gaga, Rihanna and Nelson Mandela, was tasered to death by Florida Police earlier this month after he broke into a neighbor’s mansion and had a fight with the owner.

He punched a resident and swallowed drugs while naked, according to investigators, and died in hospital a short time after Miami-Dade police had shocked him.

Oosterbroek, who was a father-of-two, lost his job looking out for Jay Z, Beyonce and their newly-born daughter, Blue Ivy, after they discovered he had hired a prostitute on duty.

The hip-hop couple were reportedly 
outraged by his actions because they trusted Oosterook 'with their 
lives'.

According to a source they made a deal with a major publication last year to ensure the story 
was covered up.

With the
 arrival of Blue Ivy, they feared he would be a danger to their family. 
Then members of the showbiz industry realised he could not be trusted, 
and he struggled to find a new position.

Oosterbroek had allegedly suffered from depression after losing 
the job and began using drugs. He had completed a number of stints in rehab over several years.

Many
 of his friends and family hoped his problems would stop in 2009, when he
 married girlfriend April McDaniel in New York, but his personal issues continued.

After beginning his career as a guard to Nelson Mandela, Oosterbroek went on to form his own private security firm named RAD.

Three
 years ago, he went above and beyond the line of duty when he broke the 
legs of a fan who dared rush the stage at a Jay Z concert in Washington,
 D.C.
