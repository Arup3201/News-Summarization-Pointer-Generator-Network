Mention of sin is to be restored to the Church of England’s baptism service after an experiment dropping the use of the word was abandoned.

The Church announced in January that it was trying out new wording that asked parents and godparents to make a single, broad pledge to ‘reject evil’.

Among other phrases abandoned in the experimental christening rite were those referring to ‘the deceit and corruption of evil’, ‘the sins that separate us from God and neighbour’, and a promise to ‘fight valiantly as a disciple of Christ against sin, the world and the devil’.

Change: The word 'sin' is set to be reinstated during a baptism service after an experiment to abandon it failed

Proposals set to be agreed by the Church of England’s General Synod, meeting in York next month, restore use of the word sin – although they will still go ahead with axing the other phrases.

In the new version, parents and godparents would only be required to say that they ‘turn away from sin’ and ‘reject evil’. Changes are being made to adapt to a population that increasingly has no Christian background, the church said.

Officials had wanted to avoid putting off people who may be offended by being addressed as sinners. The traditional baptism rite – in use from 1662 to the 1960s – asks parents and godparents: ‘Dost thou, in the name of this Child, renounce the Devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all covetous desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow nor be led by them?’

The Synod will also look at approving a ‘shorter, clearer liturgy’ for all services.
