Peter Crouch and his wife Abbey enjoyed a night out on the tiles for the NME Awards - with the help of award-winning Kasabian.

The Stoke City forward, whose robot dance became an instant hit, looked relaxed as he partied alongside the 'NME's Best British Band.'

Crouch is a well-known Kasabian fan and was caught on video in December crowd-surfing at their gig in Brixton.

Stoke fans will be hoping the giant forward will be jumping into the crowd for a different reason when they visit Tim Sherwood's new club Aston Villa.

The former Tottenham boss knows he needs to get an immediate reaction from his players if they're to avoid relegation.

However, the in-form striker will not be giving his old team a helping hand with the chance of European football a real possibility with Stoke.

Crouch has three goals in three games for Stoke and will want to punish his old team Aston Villa on Saturday
