2014 has seen another 12 months of tantalising sporting action. From events such as the World Cup to the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup - there has been a plethora of moments that have captivated us all.

Sportsmail have captured these historic moments step-by-step through our own brilliant photography team.

Below, Sportsmail's Andy Hooper picks out his favourite taken images from 2014.

The favourite of my images this year has to be Hadrian’s Wall, not because it’s my best image but because it’s creative, took a lot of planning, was technical to shoot and retouch.

This image was used as a preview to the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games in the summer. It’s supposed to be a bit of fun with participating athletes dressed up in St George’s Cross kilts and kit! I wanted the English team to look warrior-like and invading the Games by leaping over Hadrian’s Wall.

Including preparation, planning and shooting this image took three months. 

Athletes are spread all over the country and were involved in heavy training in the lead up to the Games so I could only photograph them individually at their respective training camps. As these were all elite athletes it was impossible to get them to Hadrian’s Wall, they only get one day off a week and the last thing they want to be doing is spend it travelling to Scotland.

This meant that the finished picture would have to be photoshopped together. I wanted it to be as real as possible so on the drive up to Edinburgh in the spring for the Scotland v England rugby game, I stopped off at Hadrian’s Wall to shoot the background. I wanted a panoramic images of the wall so the finished background is made up of 6 individual images. All shot at dawn on a beautifully sunny morning the foreboding grey sky was added in later!

The individual athletes (which included Louis Smith, Adam Gemili and Max Whitlock) were shot in hotel rooms, corridors, car park and gyms in locations from London to Leeds. All the athletes did a great job at visualising where they were in the image even though standing in a car park or bouncing on a trampoline.

The real genius behind the picture is Anthony McDonald, the creative retoucher, who was able to bring all the elements together and polish them into a consistent group image. 

The finished image created a talking point on the first day of the Games which was exactly what we wanted!
