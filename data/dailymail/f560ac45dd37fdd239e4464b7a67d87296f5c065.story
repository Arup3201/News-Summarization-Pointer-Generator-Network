Mother-of-one Joanne Mjadzelics, 39, (pictured outside Cardiff Crown Court today) is on trial for sharing indecent images with disgraced Ian Watkins

Disgraced paedophile singer Ian Watkins and his ex-lover fantasised in online chats about kidnapping children from outside a school to kill and abuse, a court heard today.

The trial of Watkins' former girlfriend Joanne Mjadzelics – who is accused of possessing indecent images and sharing them with the Lostprophets singer – heard how the pair discussed kidnapping a brother and sister, to 'kill one and rape the other'.

Watkins, 37, was jailed for 35 years in December 2013 for a series of sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby.

Mother-of-one Mjadzelics claims she tried to report the Lostprophets singer to police in 2009 but alleges that officers didn't take her seriously.

The 39-year-old from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, is accused of four counts of possessing indecent images of children, two charges of distributing indecent images of children and one charge of encouraging Watkins to send her an indecent image of a child.

However, she claims she kept the images and online chats on her computer because she was trying to 'trap' Watkins and wanted the police to 'take her seriously'.

Cardiff Crown Court heard today how detectives trawled through pages and pages of transcripts of online chat they recovered from Watkins' computer.

In one file entitled 'Jo Filth', the pair discussed cross dressing, child abuse and kidnapping a brother and sister from outside a school, killing one and raping the other.

Watkins also talked of getting Mjadzelics pregnant so that he could rape their baby.

Asked about the online chat during police interview, Mjadzelics told detectives: 'I don't remember. I don't have any explanation for what's said or what's going through my mind when I said it.'

Mjadzelics told the interviewing officers that she reported the singer four years before he was convicted but that 'nothing had been done about it'.

'I knew I needed to do something,' she said.

Mjadzelics said she needed Watkins to 'trust her' and 'get evidence'.

'The only time I contacted him was to try and trap him and I had to go that far,' she told police.

Jurors have previously been told that Watkins and Mjadzelics made a sex tape in a Cardiff hotel where they shared his fantasies of child abuse and death.

The court heard how Mjadzelics reported Watkins to police and social services in early 2009 – four years before he was convicted – and raised the alarm over his child sex crimes.

However, the court heard how police failed to carry out searches of his home and computers and missed his child abuse images and videos about raping infants.

Michael Wolkind QC, defending Mjadzelics, told the court today how the trial is part of a cover-up by police who didn't investigate Watkins because he was famous.

Mr Wolkind said: 'This trial is a mission to cover up the failings of the police. The police didn't listen.

'They didn't take Joanne's information seriously because of biased and lazy thinking.

'To them she wasn't someone who worked in retail, in banking, had enlisted in the army or become a special constable - that is not the person they saw or listened to.

'To the lazy and biased police officers she was a prostitute who had been sectioned - only she has never been sectioned in her life

'But that lie found its way into police documents and it went from force to force.'

Mr Wolkind told the jury that the police had failed to protect babies from Ian Watkins and mothers who 'donated their own for abuse for their excitement for sexual turn on'.

He said: 'To police, Joanne became a nuisance and she had been harassing that nice Mr Watkins.

'Babies could have been saved if Joanne had been taken seriously but Watkins was a famous rock star so it was different.

'She wasn't believed and it wasn't properly investigated. What was she supposed to do?

'We are not talking about theoretical ways in which she could have done better. She did pretty well in the face of police incompetence.

'If she had not kept on seeing Watkins would he and the two mothers be locked up now? No.

'She played Watkins to expose him.

'This is a case filled with sadness but she had a legitimate reason to possess those photographs.

'She desperately played along with Watkins to track him.'

Turning to Mjadzelics, he said: 'On behalf of decent members of society, thank you for what you did.'

At the end of his speech Mr Wolkind added: 'Let's see if a jury cares if the police got it wrong for years.'

Earlier today, the court heard how Mjadzelics kept child abuse images and online chats on her computer so police would 'take her seriously'.

After her arrest in 2013, she told how she reported Watkins' to police and social services four years earlier because she was worried about the safety of a young girl close to him.

The court heard Mjadzelics said: 'I was worried about her and the way he [Watkins] spoke about her.

'He spoke about how she was "super flirty" - but she was four years old.

'That is when I knew I had to do something because I knew she was in danger. The rest of it was just fantasy talk until then.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard how mother-of-one Mjadzelics raised concerns with police and social services about Watkins' (pictured) child sex crimes four years before he was finally convicted of a series of offences

'May 2011 is when I decided I needed to do something and get more evidence of him and get more confessions out of him.

'I had reported him and nothing had been done so I knew I needed to do something again.

'I had to make him trust me so I had to take drugs with him again and go along with what he said.

'I needed to get evidence and confessions and the only way I could do that was to earn his trust again.' 

The court was told how Mjadzelics first met Watkins at the end of 2006 and began a sexual relationship.

Mjadzelics said Watkins began talking about abusing and raping children during August 2007.

She told officers in a police interview that she had told Watkins she needed to tell police about his child abuse in the summer of 2008 but he had silenced her.

Mjadzelics said: 'He made me sign a gagging order because I said I needed to speak to police. He made me sign the gagging order to shut me up.'

Ian Watkins was jailed for 35 years in December 2013 after being convicted of a number of horrific sex crimes including the attempted rape of a baby

Prosecutor Jim Davies said that when Watkins was arrested and his home was searched they discovered a sex tape from 2008 titled 'Jo Paedo Talk Cardiff'.

Mr Davies said: 'While they were having sex they were talking about him getting her pregnant so they could have a child to abuse.'

During online sex chats in 2011, indecent images of children were sent by Watkins to Mjadzelics and she sent replies saying she wanted to 'play for real and ruin little s***s' lives'.

In another exchange, Mjadzelics told Watkins: 'Part of me feels you get off on showing me stuff you can get away with, knowing that is what I have wanted since forever.'

She also told Watkins she thought they had a 'deep connection that couldn't be matched' and signed off one message: 'Child molesters till we die.'

Mjadzelics was arrested as part of Operation Globe - a worldwide investigation into Watkins' vile paedophile activities.

Mr Davies said there was no dispute from Mjadzelics that she was in possession of four indecent images of children, had sent an indecent image of a child and had twice encouraged Watkins to send her an image of child rape.

But the jury heard she claimed she kept the images to trap Wakins and bring him to justice.

Mjadzelics denies all of the charges against her.

The 13 sex offences Watkins pleaded guilty to last November included the attempted rape of an 11-month-old child. Police also found a stash of child porn videos - some of which he had made himself.

Originally, Watkins had pleaded his innocence to a string of offences - despite damning video evidence.

He changed his plea at the last minute - averting a trial - but then complained he had not realised that his guilty plea had made him 'look guilty'.

While awaiting sentencing in December 2013, he was recorded by prison officials saying the whole thing was 'megalolz' during a telephone call to a friend.

The trial of Mjadzelics continues.
