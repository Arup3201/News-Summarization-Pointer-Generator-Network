The closed-circuit television footage showing a double-amputee Marine going through a TSA checkpoint does not show him being forced to remove his prosthetic legs, the government agency claimed today, going directly against the complaint a congressman filed against the government agency earlier this week.

On Monday, Rep Duncan Hunter (R-California) wrote a terse letter to Transportation Security Administrator John Pistole asking why Cpl Toran Gaal was forced to remove his prosthetic legs and later had to stand on them without the use of his wheelchair in what the congressman called a ‘humiliating’ experience.

However, the TSA has fired back with their own account, saying that initial CCTV footage shows Cpl Gaal passing through the security checkpoint at Arizona’s Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on March 13 without removing his prostheses.

Humiliated: Marine Cpl Toran Gaal, pictured, lost both of his legs in an IED explosion in Afghanistan; a congressman wrote the TSA to say he was 'humiliated' at a recent security check after he was forced to remove his prostheses

Disputed: The TSA says after a preliminary review of CCTV footage, the Marine was not forced to remove his prosthetic legs (file photo)

Cpl Gaal, who was not named in the letter Rep Duncan sent the TSA agent, lost both of his legs to an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in Sangin Province, Afghanistan.

The Marine currently lives in San Diego and serves in the Wounded Warrior Battalion out of Camp Pendleton. He and other wounded Marines were flying back after a spring training fundraiser, according to NBC San Diego.

The TSA told the Arizona Republic in a statement: ‘Preliminary review of CCTV indicates there was no removal of prosthetic limbs.’

They added that the two men who conducted the March 13 screening are veterans themselves – one, a former Marine and the other, an 18-year veteran of the Air Force.

Joe Kasper, Rep Hunter’s Deputy Chief of Staff, spoke to
MailOnline by phone from the congressman’s headquarters in Washington. He said that
the TSA is trying to throw a red herring into the greater argument of how the
war-wounded are treated at airport security.

‘Here’s the thing – TSA’s going to make you think what they
want you to think,’ he said. ‘The Marine never complained. It was the people
who were escorting him. They felt disrespected, they felt mistreated. The
problem here is the situational awareness in the tone and lack of awareness.

‘There has to be a part on TSA to acknowledge there is an
issue – not the leg issue, but the bigger problem that he and other veterans
and the war-wounded need extra help. That’s what it’s all about and that’s what
Mr Hunter was getting at,’ he said.

In transit: Cpl Gaal and other wounded Marines were in Phoenix for a spring training event; the alleged incident happened on March 13 when they were flying back to San Diego

He said that Mr Hunter, a combat veteran himself who served
in Fallujah, is passionate about fighting for the rights of U.S. military
members and veterans. ‘He understands what’s involved and there’s nothing that
bothers him more than seeing servicemen mistreated.’

The larger issue, Mr Kasper added, is the lack of respect
and professional courtesies by TSA agents towards those who need extra
assistance – something that is difficult to legislate.

 'The
problem here is in the tone and lack of awareness. There has to be a part on TSA to acknowledge there is an
issue, the bigger problem that he and other veterans
and the war wounded need extra help. That’s what it’s all about.'

‘As federal agents themselves, they’re the ones who should
know better, first and foremost,’ he said.

‘Hearing back from the TSA is going to be important,’ he
added, saying that he’s heard no official response from the government agency
since sending the letter via fax on Monday, though he added that the process
can sometimes take weeks.

When asked if he could definitively say whether Cpl Gaal was
forced to remove his prostheses, Mr Kasper answered that the other veterans who
were traveling with him would ‘stand by it.

‘Witnesses said he took off his legs,’ Mr Kasper said. ‘At a
bare minimum, he was at least asked to take off his legs.’

Servicemen: Cpl Gaal lost his legs after an explosion in Afghanistan; he is currently stationed in the 'Wounded Warrior' battalion out of Camp Pendleton

He concluded: ‘All the problems with TSA is indicative of
the bigger problems they refuse to address,’ he said.

Fight: Rep Duncan Hunter has been vocal in his support of the rights of servicemen

The TSA has not yet responded to MailOnline’s request for
comment.

The government agency currently offers a ‘Wounded Warrior’ 
program where injured service members are allowed to go through an 
expedited screening process, but said it would expand its screening 
options.

Neither Sky Harbor nor the TSA said they received a complaint from the alleged incident.

In
his original complaint, Rep Hunter wrote: ‘These Marines had an 
unfortunate experience, which is worthy of your attention and any 
explanation you can provide.’

In his letter, he included two photographs of the Marine, saying they corroborated Cpl Gaal’s complaint.

As the Marine Times notes, Cpl Gaal and his fellow Marines were initially escorted to the wrong checkpoint. Rep Hunter wrote that no TSA officers offered to help him to the correct security checkpoint.

‘I would like to know what discretion a TSA officer has in this situation as well as the ability of TSA officers to assist and individual between screening locations, especially if that individual is unable to walk or move on his or her own,’ he wrote.

Rep. Hunter asked in his letter for more sensitivity and awareness when examining military workers.
