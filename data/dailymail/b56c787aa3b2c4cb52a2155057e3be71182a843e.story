At times it feels as if we know the homes in television shows better than our own, but for some an affinity with fictional living spaces extends far beyond the TV screen.

In fact, an estimated 4.6 million UK homeowners are so obsessed with interiors seen in sitcoms and dramas that they've spent thousands of pounds filling their own homes with identical furniture and interior design features, according to a survey.

Taking in everything from the apartments in Friends, to the 60s design masterpieces of Mad Men and even the 'reality' homes of TOWIE, the research sought to discover just how influential iconic on-screen living spaces are on our own interiors.

Get the look: An estimated 4.6 million UK homeowners have been so taken with living spaces in sitcoms and dramas that they've spent thousands of pounds filling their own homes with identical furniture and features

For almost one third (31 per cent) of homeowners surveyed, such shows are a treasure trove of inspiration, with respondents spending an average of £3,836 each to make their humble abodes look like they belong on the TV - over £3.5 million in total.

In terms of the TV home that's held in the highest regard, nothing comes close to Carrie Bradshaw's aspirational apartment from Sex & The City.

While the American comedy-drama may have left screens almost a decade ago, in the style and interior design stakes it has truly stood the test of time.

Inspired homeowners spend a total of over £530,000 replicating the famous walk-in wardrobe (45 per cent), floor-to-ceiling bookcases (38 per cent), and flowing white curtains (30 per cent) seen in Carrie's chic Manhattan pad - more than any other on-screen living space.

Although Carrie's flat is deemed the most inspirational on-screen home it's the Norcross home in TOWIE which is the most expensive to replicate.

Homeowners spend an average £3,016 each to kit out their home with the Aga range cooker, framed plasma TV, chandeliers and pool table.

The same can't be said for Del and Rodney’s Peckham pad from Only Fools & Horses, which, despite a recent revival in 70s furniture, has not inspired its fans, coming bottom of the inspirational TV shows table.

Looking across the country, homeowners in the West Midlands (35 per cent), London (34 per cent), and the North East (33 per cent) are the most likely to turn to the living spaces of TV shows to inspire their own abodes.

Matthew Poll, of MORE TH>N Home Insurance, who carried out the research, said: 'There are countless TV programmes, magazines and books dedicated to inspiring interior design; however, it’s fascinating to see just how many homeowners are turning to sitcoms, dramas and even the likes of TOWIE as a source of inspiration for their own homes.

'Given how much time we invest in TV shows it’s perhaps not surprising that those same living spaces leave an indelible impression on homeowners and some clearly come at a significant cost. '
