Double tragedy: Louise Ann Snape (left) died from the same heart condition that killed her four-year-old daughter Katie (right)

A grieving mother died from the same rare genetic heart condition that killed her little girl, an inquest heard.

Louise Ann Snape, 35, passed away at her home in Middleton, Greater Manchester, three years after daughter Katie, four, lost her life.

An inquest at Rochdale Coroners Court heard that Ms Snape and Katie both died from dilated cardiomyopathy, a genetic illness which damages heart muscles and affects one in 5,000 people.

Katie’s twin sister Lauren, now eight, who also suffers from the condition, discovered her mother’s body on March 29.

Katie,
a pupil at Little Heaton Primary School, died in July 2010, four days 
before her fifth birthday, while she was waiting for a second heart 
transplant.

Ms Snape, a former
care assistant, of Rhodes, only became aware she suffered from the 
condition - which is sometimes known as sudden death syndrome - and had 
passed it on to her daughters after the girls were born.

She suffered from blood clots on her lungs and spent a short time in hospital while the girls were young.

Her
sister, Sarah, told the inquest she struggled to cope after Katie’s 
death, especially when her partner, the girls’ father, Simon Williams, 
was sent to prison.

Sarah, 
of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, said: 'Losing Katie was absolutely devastating 
for Louise. She usually managed, but sometimes she struggled.

'I used to go down and help sometimes 
and she had lots of friends for support. Katie’s death really affected 
Louise. She became very depressed.'

The
inquest heard that Ms Snape, whose mother died from cancer just three 
days after she passed away, was taking prescribed anti-depressants.

Sudden death syndrome is caused by a 'ventricular arrhythmia' - a disturbance in the heart's rhythm.

It can strike at any age and can even affect those who are fit and athletic.

Sometimes there are no warning signs, but in other cases victims can experience dizziness or fainting spells. 

Every year at least 600 young people die as a result of the condition.

It’s different from a heart attack, where one of the arteries supplying the heart is blocked with a blood clot, starving the heart muscle of oxygen-rich blood.

Sarah said she was not aware her sister was ill in the days before she died.

She added: 'She probably would not want to worry me if she wasn’t feeling well because I was back and forth with hospital dealing with our mum.'

A report from PC Stuart Lewis, who was called to the family home on the morning after Ms Snape's death, said that Louise had watched television with her daughter until 10pm the night before her death.

Lauren awoke early to discover her mother lying on the floor and went to a next-door neighbour, who called the emergency services.

Toxicology reports found that Ms Snape had no alcohol in her system and her medication had not contributed to her death.

Recording a verdict of natural causes, deputy coroner Elaine Maloney, told Ms Snape: 'Your family has suffered a lot from this condition.

'I can only pass on my sincere condolences for what you have been through.'
