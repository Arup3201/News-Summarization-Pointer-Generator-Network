Relationship: The woman seduced the boy when she was 22 and he was 13 (file picture)

A Melbourne woman who repeatedly had sex with a 13-year-old boy and had three of his children has escaped jail.

Victorian County Court Judge Christopher O'Neill sentenced her to three years in prison, suspended for three years.

The woman now has six children and Judge O'Neill said her family circumstances had to be taken into account in the sentence.

'Normally offending of this seriousness would warrant a significant jail sentence,' Judge O'Neill said.

'(But) there is a discretion to the court to grant special mercy where the circumstances of family hardship are exceptional.'

Judge O'Neill said the woman's husband worked full time to support the children.

'I accept that almost every waking moment is spent looking after the children in one way or another,' he said.

The woman, who cannot be named, began having sex with the boy in August 2004, when she was 22 and living next door to his family in Melbourne.

The Victorian County Court was on Tuesday told the woman had three daughters to her victim, the first of whom was born when the boy was just 15.

The woman, now 32, pleaded guilty to maintaining a sexual relationship with a child under the age of 16.

Judge O'Neill said the woman gave the boy alcohol, drugs and freedom, but that was not evidence of grooming or predatory behaviour.

The boy was 13 when the pair started having sex. They lived together for a time and had their first child when he was 15.

The couple had two more children before they split up in 2009.

Court case: She avoided jail time due to caring for six children, despite maintaining a relationship with the boy until 2009

Prosecutor Francesca Holmes said the boy's mother tried to tell authorities while the relationship was occurring, but they declined to act when both denied it.

Defence barrister Barnaby Johnson said after the relationship ended, the victim set up a hate page on Facebook directed at the woman.

He said people put threats against the woman on the page, including 'die b**** die' and 'should be shot on sight'.The page has since been shut down.

The boy reported the relationship to police in November 2011, but the woman wasn't interviewed until July 2012.

When police did interview her, she said the boy had raped her and lied about the length of the relationship, Ms Holmes said.

Ms Holmes said the woman has sole access to their children, and her victim had not seen his daughters since the relationship ended in 2009.

Judge O'Neill said the woman had an IQ of 64 and showed the cognitive ability of a teenager.

He also said the woman would be on the sex offenders register for life.
