Ian Wilkinson hanged himself after taking drink and drugs to cope with a secret anxiety condition, an inquest has heard

An outgoing advertising executive known to his colleagues for his quick wit and hilarious one-liners hanged himself after taking drink and drugs to cope with a secret anxiety condition, an inquest has heard.

To colleagues and friends Ian Wilkinson, 28, from Didsbury, Manchester, was well liked and appeared confident.

But unbeknown to his employers the bachelor was struggling at home with severe depressive symptoms which dated back to his teenage years.

An inquest heard that he would snort cocaine and go on drinking binges to deal with his severe anxiety problems.

Manchester Coroner's Court heard that he also ran into debt with payday loan companies in an attempt to fund his habit. His parents - a doctor and a headmaster - paid £4,000 to bail him out.

He was found hanged at the family home in Didsbury, Manchester, just hours after texting his GP mother Janet to say: 'You won’t have to worry about me much longer. I will be out of your hair soon.'

The hearing in Manchester was told that the Mr Wilkinson had been a talented writer who colleagues said had a  'wicked sense of humour.'

But
 the hearing he had been confiding to his mother about his 
reliance on alcohol to aid his anxiety and was referred to a private 
mental health hospital for treatment.

PC
 Stephen McGonigle who investigated his death told the hearing: 'Ian 
presented a confident persona but wanted to have a steady girlfriend. 
His relationships didn’t last long.

'His
 salary led to binge drinking. He was prescribed anti-depressants but 
admitted to his mother he was taking cocaine while on them.

'He
 worked throughout but the drinking continued. He could go days or weeks
 without alcohol but would then binge for several days.

'In
 February 2013 he confided that he was in debt to a payday loan company 
for £4,000 having borrowed £1,200. His parents paid it.

'He
 was using cocaine to overcome his anxiety. His social life since 
leaving university was not great and he would drink on his own.'

But Manchester Coroner's Court heard that the bachelor was struggling at home with severe depressive symptoms which dated back to his teenage years

After graduating from Manchester Metropolitan University with a Masters degree in International Public Relations, he got a series of administration jobs before accepting a post as PR & Social Media Executive at Access Advertising in 2012.

On his LinkedIn page he said: 'Really enjoying my new job, the people and the "can do" attitude that we have in the office.

'It’s nice to go to work in the morning and enjoy it, I never really thought I’d say that. Can’t wait to learn more and hopefully I can use my thirst for more knowledge to help the company to continue the great PR work we do.'

Mr Wilkinson went to Malaysia to visit his father Donald Wilkinson who is currently headmaster of the independent Bearwood College in Wokingham, Surrey but who at the time was working as an acting headteacher at a school in Asia.

During the visit he seemed happy and back to his normal self but on his return he fell back into depression where he would drink and take cocaine alone.

The court was told that tragedy struck in June last year after his mother went to work,

PC McGonigle added: 'She phoned him while at work but he didn’t reply. She then rang his work and was told he hadn’t arrived. At 1pm he text to say he was ok. She asked why he wasn’t at work but he said he was.

'She considered going home at lunch but decided against it as she was working at the surgery.

'Having finished at 8pm she went home. Upon arrival she found herself in trepidation as to what she may find and thought he would be in a coma or hanging.

The hearing in Manchester was told that the Mr Wilkinson had been a talented writer who colleagues said had a 'wicked sense of humour'

'Once Janet had found him inside she called the police and told them she was a GP and she knew he was dead.'

Mr Wilkinson was found dressed in his work clothes at the time of his death, after he had promised to go into the office.

Toxicology tests showed he was the equivalent of four-and-a-half times the legal drink driving limit when he died.

Recording an open conclusion, Manchester assistant coroner Fiona Borrill said the alcohol coupled with no suicide note led her to believe it was not clear whether Ian intended to kill himself at the time.

She told the family: 'Can I offer my sincere sympathies in this terrible situation you have found yourselves in.'

In a statement Ian’s family said: 'Ian was a lovely, kind, genuinely nice man and had friends from all

walks of life. He worked in PR, a job which he loved.

'Ian didn’t judge people on their background or their academic abilities and we have had such heart warming letters from all those whose paths he crossed. His kind words or deeds had really touched them and he never sought praise for these.

'Ian had a phenomenal general knowledge and this all came to him so effortlessly, but he was always happy to help others who did not find work so easy. Most of all, Ian had such a quick wit and would make us laugh with his impressions and one-liners. He has been the life and soul of so many parties.

'Sadly, Ian developed severe anxiety and depressive symptoms in his teenage years and these overwhelming feelings of fear and low mood, blighted his life thereafter.'

A tribute from Ian’s employers and colleagues at Access Advertising said: 'Ian was the life and soul of the office, a well-loved colleague with a wicked sense of humour.

'He was a talented writer and an even better story teller. Sadly, Ian was troubled by anxiety and depressive symptoms and recently lost his battle with mental health problems.

'The team miss seeing his face, hearing his hilarious quips and receiving his silly photos and articles.'
