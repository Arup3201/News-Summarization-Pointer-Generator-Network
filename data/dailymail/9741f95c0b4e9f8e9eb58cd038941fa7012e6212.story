A fish handler's cured hand warts has lead researchers to look at Tasmanian sea snails as a potential cure for common cold sores and the related herpes virus.

The blue blood of abalone, an edible sea snail found in pristine bays along Tasmania's coast, contains anti-viral properties that researchers have shown block the herpes virus' entry into cells.

The abalone's healing properties were uncovered completely by accident, researchers say.

Adrian Cuthbertson from Marine Biotechnologies Australia said 10 years ago when the company was involved in abalone serum trials relating to cancer treatments, patients who drank processed forms of abalone blood reported fewer cases of cold sore breakouts.

'Around the same time we had an employee responsible for loading and unloading abalone shells containers,' he said.

'After a month of working with the shellfish he found that the viral warts which had plagued his hands for years disappeared.

Researchers Negar Talaei Zanjani and Dr Peter Valtchev from the University of Sydney are among those working with the herpes virus cell and blue blood of abalone

The abalone's healing properties were uncovered completely by accident, researchers say

'This convinced me that abalone had to be investigated for its anti-viral properties.'

Mr Cuthbertson said he then started working with chemical engineers at the University of Sydney and virus researchers at the Westmead Millennium Institute on the breakthrough research.

The research has shown the same protein that gives the abalone blood its blue colour also has anti-viral properties.

Professor Tony Cunningham, from Westmead Millennium Institutes, said while current treatment can shorten the disease, it cannot kill the virus.

'With the information we now have, we are hopeful that we can develop an anti-viral therapy that will prevent or reduce recurrence of the virus and/or hasten healing of the lesions,' Prof Cunningham said.
