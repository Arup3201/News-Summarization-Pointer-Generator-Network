On the run: Mounir Jaouane, the sixth prisoner to abscond from HMP Hatfield in as many weeks, was jailed in 2007 for robbery

A violent robber has absconded from an open prison - the sixth inmate at the same facility to do so in six months.

Mounir Jaouane, 22, failed to return to HMP Hatfield in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, at around 3pm yesterday.

The criminal, who was given an indeterminate sentence in January 2007, had been released on temporary licence from the open prison to his former home in Sheffield.

Five other men have fled HMP Hatfield since May - and only three are back behind bars after being rearrested.

Pressure is already growing on the Government to explain the recent rash of escapes from the category D open resettlement prison.

On Sunday, Damian Pearson, sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for burglary in 2013, escaped. The 24-year-old is said to have links to the local area.

Burglar Darrell Roy Burbeary, 43, from Sheffield, escaped on June 15 - he is still on the run despite writing a taunting letter to his local paper claiming police had made a mistake with the appeal.

Richard Brown, 27, who was in jail for aggravated burglary, fled on June 10 but was rearrested in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire.

Thief Dean Jackson, 27, escaped on May 21 but was rearrested in Newcastle, while knifepoint-robber Damien Burns, 39, fled on May 19, and was rearrested in Scarborough.

Caroline Flint, Labour MP for Don Valley, met with Prison Minister Jeremy Wright for a second time on Tuesday seeking answers about the series of escapes.

Mrs Flint said: 'Residents are understandably concerned and I have made clear to the Minister that public safety has to be his number one priority.

'I held an urgent meeting with the Prison Minister, Jeremy Wright, the second in a week, to ask that every prisoner be risk assessed for potential flight to reduce the chance of absconding.

'I also want to know whether the prison has warned every prisoner that they will face a longer jail sentence in a closed prison if they abscond.'

The MP has arranged a meeting with Hatfield’s governor to discuss the escapes.

Joe Simpson, of the Prison Officers Association, said many prisoners were absconding because prisons were overcrowded and understaffed.

Mr Simpson said the wrong type of prisoner was increasingly being sent to open prisons because the UK prison population was growing.

He said: 'They’re also cutting staff - Hatfield is currently five staff lower than it should be.'

It is not just HMP Hatfield that prisoners are disappearing from.

Darren 
Douglas, 46, and Ricardo Dunn, 32,  absconded from Spring Hill open 
prison in Buckinghamshire, in the early hours of Sunday.

Douglas
 is serving a life sentence for a murder he committed in Birmingham in 
1998 where he stabbed a man to death outside a pub.

Described
 during his trial as a 'man with a very short fuse', he confronted his 
victim in a toilet and accused him of being 'queer' before forcing him 
outside for a fight.

He then pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed him seven times, including at least twice through the heart.

Douglas, who police say should not be approached, had already been jailed 'frequently' for burglary and other violent offences before the murder.

Dunn is serving an indeterminate sentence following a conviction for GBH with intent in Burnley. He assaulted a man following a row in the street in 2009.  

Chief inspector Olly Wright, of Thames Valley Police, said: 'We are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen these men in the area and can provide us with information about their movements.

'These men were both convicted for violent offences and I would advise anyone who sees them, to not approach them and call police immediately.

'Both men have links with other areas so may have travelled out of the Thames Valley to those areas. I would like to remind people that it is a criminal offence to harbour these men and anyone caught doing so would be arrested.'

The issue of prisoners walking out of open prisons has been in the spotlight since 'Skullcracker' Michael Wheatley went on the run earlier this year.

Callous: Wheatley even robbed a bank while on the run and was well known for pistol-whipping victims and was described in court as a 'career' criminal.

In May, the 55-year-old sparked a nationwide manhunt after he absconded from Category D jail HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.

The prolific armed robber - dubbed the 'Skullcracker' for pistol-whipping innocent bystanders during raids - went on to rob a building society in Surrey.

He was already serving 13 life sentences for a string of raids when he disappeared, sparking a political row over the day release of dangerous criminals.

After being caught, he was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court to life behind bars and told he will serve at least 10 years before being eligible for parole.

It has also emerged that two prisoners, Scott Callaghan, 35, and Billy Harkins, 29, disappeared from the same prison on Saturday.

Callaghan is serving a sentence for perverting the course of justice and Harkins for aggravated burglary, Kent Police said.

Last month Sussex Police revealed that 89 prisoners had gone missing since the 1970s from Ford open prison and are still unaccounted for.
