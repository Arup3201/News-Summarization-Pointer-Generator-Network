For a manager who is clearly something of an innovator, Sean Dyche is doing his best to sound old school. He is discussing management theory and the different ways in which he attempts to get an alternative view on improving performance at Burnley, when suddenly he changes tack.

'Sometimes it is what it is, by the way,' he says. 'When I came here the team was conceding 2.6 goals a game. It wasn't rocket science. It wasn't like I had to find some radical thing of making it work better, other than just shoring up the defence. Things like that were obvious.'

Dyche is football management's latest miracle man, though he would take umbrage at the characterisation even if it is hard to avoid when he took Burnley up on a wage bill that was the 15th biggest in the Championship and after selling his star striker, Charlie Austin, to QPR.

Clearly there is something about Dyche, as even he will concede. 'Before Christmas last season it was: 'Oh, they can't do it with just two strikers'. Then it was: 'Oh, they've been lucky with injuries'. No planning, of course. Just luck.'

Now he has to do it again, only this time against Premier League clubs with wage bills 10 times his own and with a team who have scored one goal all season and have their two first-choice strikers, Danny Ings and Sam Vokes, injured.

Burnley are joint bottom, have not scored in nearly nine hours and could do with a win at West Bromwich Albion on Sunday. Again, the problem staring him in the face does not require much analysis.

'At the minute we haven't scored the goals we wanted. Are we close? Yes. Do the stats suggest we're close? Yes. But now it's about looking at what kind of goals. What kind of goals do we want to score? How can we score those goals? So there's a detail within each detail.'

Still, a measure of how far Burnley have come is that US Network NBC are waiting to talk to him. Dyche makes himself at home in the Fifties bungalow that represents Burnley's media centre.

It previously belonged to former Burnley forward and latterly groundsman, Arthur Bellamy, in perpetuity until his death last January. Now it is the hub of globalised media activity.

Dyche, 43, stands at the centre of it. His positivity is unquenchable. A member of staff tells him the three 0-0 draws against Manchester United, Crystal Palace and Sunderland represents the first time Burnley have kept three consecutive clean sheets in the top flight since 1968. Dyche loves that; a positive angle to be gleaned from three games without a goal.

Conversely, he is perplexed by any cynicism. He is exasperated as to why some people were annoyed last week when U2's new album automatically downloaded free into iTunes: 'Why would you not want a U2 album? 

Dyche is a massive fan of Irish rock band U2 after revealing how much he rated their new album

'Even if you don't like it, why would you not want it? Maybe my glass is always half full. But I can't see a negative when someone like U2 drop an album in your inbox. It's worth a listen. I like Dr Dre and all that. If Dr Dre wants to drop me a new album, happy days.'

Kasabian are his ultimate band of choice and he has seen them so many times — 'I am partial to a gig' — that he launches into an explanation of the best venues at which to see them.

 'When I came out of work at Watford, they had a gig at Brixton Academy, so the band sorted for me and the staff to go. Oh, it was brilliant. Brixton is fantastic.

'That's the real deal. Because I was bit more under the radar then, I could enjoy myself.' No more sessions in the mosh pit as a respectable manager? 'It's not so easy now.'

Dyche brings something different to management. People have pointed to the fact that his dad, Alan, was a management consultant for British Steel. 'My dad worked in India and Egypt and we had three months in Mexico when we were kids,' he says. 'Snakes in the garden, iguanas in the loft and holidays in Zihuatanejo, which my assistant, Ian Woan, thought was a mythical place.

Dyche applauds the Burnley fans, whom he holds a close relationship with, after the game against Chelsea 

'At the end of The Shawshank Redemption, Tim Robbins' character says: 'I'm going to a place called Zihuatanejo'. Woany said: 'I thought you'd made that up'. He didn't believe that we used to go to there when I was seven, jumping off my dad's shoulders into the water.

'My dad and I didn't sit there talking about management when I was a kid. But there were little key fundamentals. In the good old days, everyone would sit round a table and have a meal and converse. That's getting harder to do. We do it at home. I insist upon it as a family.

'Across that table we'd be talking about work and, as a kid, you don't get it at the time. And you don't know what box it lives in, that information. But as you get older you reflect on it and think: 'Oh, actually, yeah I remember that.' You're subliminally being educated about life.'

Not that he would have you think he has hit on anything special. 'There's not a magic switch. I haven't found a magic solution to football management, no one has. I'm not looking to reinvent the wheel.

I'm just trying to make the best wheel I can. The game has been going since the 1800s but the pitch is roughly the same size — the ball is lighter but it's roughly the same size — there's still 11 v 11. Of course there's technology but the fundamentals haven't changed.

Dyche is confident Burnley will add the missing elements to their game and pick up some much needed wins

'People talk about this tactical 4-1-4-1 or 4-3-3. But I played at Nottingham Forest in 1987. The keeper had to play out from the back, that was his instruction and get it out to centre-halves who would split to play and the right-back and left-back would go higher. Brian Rice on the one wing was coming inside rather than running on, allowing Stuart Pearce to go on the outside.

'Neil Webb was coming short to be the playmaker: now, of course, we call it the quarterback. Nigel Clough was coming in on the front line: now we call it the false No 9. And Lee Chapman was running off the shoulders, to stretch the pitch to allow all these things to happen. That sounds pretty modern to me.

'If I started saying: 'My deep-lying midfield, my screener, my false wingers and the false No 9…' I don't want to be on trend, I want things to work. 

I want a group that is beyond me. I don't wish to pontificate, I don't wish to brand myself up to the eyeballs. I'm just giving you an honest, authentic opinion.'

Dyche is just trying to keep Burnley up. If he manages that though, he will be uber-fashionable.
