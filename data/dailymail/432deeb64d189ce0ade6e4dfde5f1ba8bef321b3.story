Pigs at one of Walmart's pork suppliers are being cruelly mistreated, according to animal-rights campaigners.

An undercover video filmed by the Humane Society of the United States appears to show pigs in cages so small they can barely move.

The pigs are recorded squealing loudly, and several of them are bleeding or displaying other injuries.

One particularly graphic moment comes when a newborn piglet has his tail and testicles cut off, apparently without any anaesthetic.

Cages: Campaigners claim that 'gestation crates' which do not allow animals to turn around, such as these ones from Seaboard Foods' facility in Goodwell, Oklahoma are cruel

Pig: Pork produced by Seaboard goes to a variety of retailers, including Walmart, the largest in the U.S.

The Humane Society is now taking legal action against Seaboard Foods, the third-largest pork supplier in the U.S. and one of Walmart's suppliers, over the conditions at their facility in Goodwell, Oklahoma.

In papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the charity claimed that Seaboard was 'misleading stakeholders through unlawful statements and omissions about Seaboard Foods' animal welfare practices'.

A Humane Society spokesman condemned the company's use of gestation crates, narrow cages which do not allow animals to turn around, calling the practice 'out of step with mainstream American values about the proper treatment of animals'.

Sows are kept in gestation crates when they are pregnant - which in many cases means spending nearly their whole lives in the cages.

Large scale: There are believed to be 2,700 caged sows at the Goodwell facility

Castration: Piglets routinely have their tails and testicles removed - apparently, often without anaesthetic

But Seaboard has defended its 
treatment of its animals, claiming in a statement that the company is 
determined to 'provide the most humane treatment for our animals.'

The
statement also said: 'We are proud of our employees for exemplifying 
best practices in their day-to-day work and truly being leaders within 
the industry.'

The company claims that the use of stalls to house livestock is not necessarily less humane than housing them in group stalls, and points out that tail docking and castration are recommended by vets.

A spokesman for Walmart told the Huffington Post that the retail giant was co-operating with Seaboard in a review of the situation.

She said that Seaboard Foods 'supply a very small percentage overall of pork products' to Walmart as one of around 100 pork suppliers.

Cuts: Several of the animals in the Humane Society's undercover video appear to be injured

However, the Humane 
Society claims there is a disconnect between the companies' public 
statements and the standards they apply in practice, including to the 
2,700 sows at the Goodwell facility.

Wayne
Pacelle, president and CEO of the organisation, said 'our findings are 
in stark contrast to claims Seaboard makes about animal welfare'.

According to the Humane Society, Seaboard's advisor on animal welfare has told the company: I feel very strongly that we've got to treat animals right, and the gestation stalls have got to go.

'Confining an animal for most of its life in a box in which it is not able to turn around does not provide a decent life.'

This is not the first time Walmart has faced criticism relating to its sale of pork.

In October, the firm was forced to close several stores in China after pork was allegedly mislabelled as organic.
