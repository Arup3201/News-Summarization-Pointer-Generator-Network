Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler's love letters to his wife are to be revealed for the first time

Nazi SS leader Heinrich Himmler's love letters to his wife are to be revealed for the first time.

Hundreds of the notorious SS commander’s private letters, notes and photographs dating from 1927 to 1945 will be published on Sunday by Germany’s Die Welt newspaper.

The architect of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of six million Jews, met his future wife Marga, who ran a Berlin nursing home, in 1927.

The trove of letters give an insight into the early days of their relationship and also document the breakdown of the marriage from 1938 onwards when Himmler had an affair with his private secretary.

The documents belonged to an Israeli family and are now being stored in Tel Aviv.

They are also expected to detail Himmler’s extreme anti-Semitism and give new insight into the rise and fall of the Nazi regime.

They were taken by U.S. soldiers from a safe in the Himmler family home after he committed suicide while in Allied custody swallowing a cyanide pill.

But it is not clear how they ended up in Israel.

Die Welt said the letters had been independently verified. Michael Hollmann, president of the German Federal Archive, told The Telegraph: ‘We are sure about these documents.

There is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the documents in Tel Aviv.’

According to Die Welt, the letters do not change the overall picture of the Nazi reign of terror, but they certainly add countless previously unknown details and help [give] a better idea of what type of person the SS leader was, his everyday life and his surroundings’.
