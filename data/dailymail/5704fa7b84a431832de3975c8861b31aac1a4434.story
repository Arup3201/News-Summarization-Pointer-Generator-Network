A diabetic sufferer in Iowa has trained his own pet to alert him to changes in his blood sugar levels after being told it would cost $25,000 for a medical assistance dog.

When Robert McVey had Type 2 diabetes diagnosed in 2012 his doctor suggested using a specially trained dog, but with a hefty price tag it wasn't an option he could afford.

Instead, he and his wife Lesli brought an adorable Labrador cross Weimaraner called Austin that they have trained themselves.

'I thought that I had trained dogs in obedience before, why can’t I train my own diabetic alert dog?' Mr McVey told the Des Moines Register.

Dogs have more than 200,000 sensors in their nose which help them detect tiny changes in a human.

When a diabetic's blood sugar level drops, the change can be detected by the dogs through the person's sweat and breath.

If a diabetic alert assistance dog detects those changes it will alert its owner in one of several ways, such as tapping them with a paw, or sitting directly in front of them. 

While the dogs are no replacement for medication or devices used to control and monitor diabetes, they play a valuable role in early detection, which can also boost the patient's confidence.

'Technically anybody can do it; it’s just the time commitment,' he added.

Like other diabetic alert medical assistance dogs, Austin is able to detect the tiny changes in Mr McVey that show his blood sugar levels are low.

The dog then touches its owner with its paw, to let them know they need to take an insulin injection.

Training Austin to spot the symptoms started when he was just a puppy, and began with basic commands most people teach their pets.

'The obedience and everything is the 
same. You still start with that and make sure they have their obedience.
 As far as the scent training and things, you start them off very 
early,' Mrs McVey told Fox News.

For the scent training, Austin was taught to detect saliva samples taken from patients with high or low blood sugar.

As well as training at home, Austin and his owners flew to Seattle for a four-day intensive workshop to improve his skills.

It wasn't long before Austin's training 
paid off. In January Mr McVey had been working outside on his car, and 
had missed a meal. When he walked inside Austin immediately tapped him 
with his paw to warn that his blood sugar level was low.

After their success with Austin, the McVeys realized they could use their experience to train other dogs to help patients who, like them, would struggle to pay for a more expensive dog.

They recently brought home a new addition to the family - Rouge - who will go from wriggling pup to life-saver in just under a year.

The couple have also set up DADs Paws 4 Life, which they are applying to have listed as a non-profit group, so they can expand their training program.

While the dogs are no replacement for devices that monitor sugar levels for diabetics, they work as an invaluable early-warning system.

The dogs are capable of letting their owners know about changes in nearly every situation, and will even wake a sleeping diabetic if they detect a drop in sugar levels.

'This early alert to shifts in blood sugar is a huge relief to diabetics and parents of diabetics struggling to identify such changes before they result in uncomfortable symptoms,' the McVeys said.
