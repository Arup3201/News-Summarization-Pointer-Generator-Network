Enjoy a dip in the sea and you risk picking up antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Swimmers and surfers are most at risk of catching the E.coli bug as they are more likely to swallow contaminated water, a study has suggested.

Scientists at the University of Exeter have warned of the danger after analysing data collected from beaches across England and Wales in 2012. 

They focused on a strain of E.coli bacteria resistant to an important class of antibiotics called third-generation cephalosporins, or 3GCs.

Study leader Dr William Gaze said: 'We know very little about how the natural environment can spread antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans, or how our exposure to these microbes can affect health.

'People are exposed to antibiotic-resistant bacteria in many ways, through person-to-person contact, via food and as a result of international travel.

'Our research establishes recreational use of coastal waters as an additional route of exposure.

'With millions of people visiting beaches in England and Wales each year, there is a risk of people ingesting 3GC resistant E. coli and it looks like water-users' exposure to all resistant bacteria could be even higher.'

Salt in sea water is known to kill off some bacteria, but not all. Although only 0.12 per cent of the E.coli found in coastal waters and rivers running on to beaches belonged to the strain, researchers said this was enough to present a 'potential risk'.

The study, published in the journal Environment International, showed risk of exposure was closely related to the water quality at any given beach.

Researchers said this demonstrated the importance of the EU's Bathing Water Directive, which aims to ensure good water quality standards, but added that people should not be put off visiting the seaside.
