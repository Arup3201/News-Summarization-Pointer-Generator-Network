Twin brothers Osbrany and Osmany Montes De Oca enlisted in the Marines together shortly after they graduated high school.

Now, just over a year later, Osmany is returning from Afghanistan to attend his brother's funeral after Osbrany was killed on Friday while serving in Helmand Province.

'They were always talking about the Marines,' said the boys' uncle AndrianoÂ  Moreta.

Osbrany Mondesdeoca, 20, joined with his twin brother the Marines shortly after high school, pursuing a long-time dream

'It's what they always wanted to do,' he told The Star Ledger.

The Department of Defense said that he died while supporting combat missions, but other reports say that Osbrany was shot by a sniper just moments after stepping off of the Marine base in Helmand.

On Monday, his 20-year-old identical twin brother Osmany flew back to their hometown of North Arlington, New Jersey, from his post in Afghanistan.

The twins' older brother Sandro Moreta, 22, also enlisted in the Marines though a few months after his younger brothers.

In love: On his Facebook wall, Osbrany says that his girlfriend Maria Samaniego (left) was the 'love of my life'

When Osbrany was killed, Sandro had not yet been deployed so his trip home was shorter, though no less painful.

Just 10 days before his untimely death, Osbrany had been promoted to the position of Lance Corporal and seemed thrilled with his job.

'He truly loved what he was doing,' his aunt Teresa said.

That was also evident on his Facebook page, where he wrote favourably about his chosen path.

'I do have a future, I am a United States Marines (sic),' Osbrany wrote.

A heartbreaking end: Osbrany was one of four boys in his family, three of whom were in the military as the youngest is still in high school

The youngest Montes De Oca brother, Franklin, is still in high school in northern New Jersey. He was clearly upset about his brother's death.

'He was a great guy. He was a hero,' Franklin told CBS.

'He was the best man I knew.'

Osbrany's
two brothers who are still serving in the military were given the 
option to leave their service, but both declined, opting to continue.

This is much to the dismay of their mother, Miriam, who is distraught over her son's death.

'She said her mind is going crazy,' Franklin said for his mother, who only speaks Spanish.

Remaining: Franklin Monte De Oca is the youngest of the four brothers

She told Franklin to tell other mothers not to send their sons to war. She also said that they must receive more training before being put into combat areas.

'She never got a chance to sleep. She's been crying all night.'

Flags flew at half-mast in North Arlington on Wednesday, as Osbrany's passing marks the 42nd death of a service member in Afghanistan since 2001.
