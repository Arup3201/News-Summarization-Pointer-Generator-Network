Huge gaps exist in the
emails former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has
provided to a congressional committee investigating the 2012
attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, the panel's
chairman said on Sunday.

Republican Representative Trey Gowdy said his committee
lacked documentation from Clinton's trip to Libya after the
attack despite a popular photo image of her using a handheld
device during a flight to that country.

'We have no emails from that day. In fact we have no emails
from that trip,' said Gowdy, who heads the committee in the U.S.
House of Representatives. 'There are huge gaps.'

Off the grid? Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has reportedly not handed over emails from her 2012 trip to Libya, despite being pictured on a flight there with a device in her hand 

Widely considered the frontrunner for the 2016 Democratic
presidential nomination, Clinton used a private email account
for all official business as President Barack Obama's secretary
of state from 2009 to 2013.

Republicans have scrutinized Clinton's actions over the
Benghazi attack in which Ambassador Chris Stevens and three
other people were killed. The private email disclosure,
published in The New York Times last week, raised Republican
concerns about Clinton's commitment to transparency.

She has since asked the State Department to release her
emails but a State Department official said the review would
take some time.

Clinton gave the committee eight emails last August and 300
in February related to the attack, Gowdy said on CBS's Face the
Nation. Last week, the committee subpoenaed the State Department
for other emails. Gowdy said that in fairness the committee
would not release the emails' content selectively.

The State Department has requested email records from all
former secretaries of state, and Clinton has given it 50,000
pages of records to review.

Speaking separately on Sunday, former Secretary of State
Colin Powell, responding to reports he too had a private email
account rather than a government one, said he did not have
emails to give the department.

'I retained none of those emails and we are working with the
State Department to see if there's anything else they want to
discuss with me about those emails,' he said on ABC's This Week.

Powell said that when he started as secretary of state under
Republican President George W. Bush, the State Department
computer systems were antiquated and he strove to update them.
In November, its unclassified email system was hacked and had to
be shut down temporarily.

Obama said on Saturday he only recently learned of Clinton's
private email account.
