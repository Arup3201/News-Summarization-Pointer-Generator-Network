A school has shamed a parent by publishing a photograph in its newsletter of her car parked on double-yellow lines outside the gates.

Fed-up teachers at Cottesmore St Mary’s Catholic Primary School, in Hove, East Sussex, say the driver of the Honda CRV constantly parks on zigzags and double yellows.

When challenged about her behaviour, the woman driver was allegedly 'unforthcoming and apparently somewhat rude', the newsletter says.

Caught: Cottesmore St Mary¿s Catholic Primary School published this photograph of the car in its newsletter

The school decided to publish an image of the vehicle illegally parked alongside a polite request for drivers to be more considerate.

The letter reads: 'It was reported, by a parent, that this car parks on the zigzags or the double yellow lines every day.

'Apparently, on Wednesday the lady car owner was asked to move off the zigzags pre-end of day pick up.

'She then apparently had moved onto the double yellow lines, making it difficult to turn the corner and thus making it dangerous for the children to cross the road.

'Apparently the lady driver was asked to move again by a parent but was unforthcoming and apparently somewhat rude.

'If this car belongs to you or someone you know, please do pass on our concerns about illegal parking and the impact it can have on the safety of our children.'

A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said he could not comment specifically on the incident at the school.

But he added: 'Zigzags are usually in place where it is dangerous for people to park, for example outside a school entrance or on the lead up to a crossing.

'Zigzags are enforceable 24 hours a day seven days a week unless there is a sign that states otherwise.

'We are now issuing tickets by post for these offences.

'This means that if you are seen, by a CCTV operator or a Civil Enforcement Officer, to be parked on a zigzag a penalty charge notice will be sent to the registered keeper of the vehicle.'

A Sussex Police spokesman added: 'Parking in restricted areas for the sake of a few minutes’ walk is just laziness and is plainly hazardous to children arriving at or leaving school.

'Officers from the neighbourhood policing teams and road policing regularly check schools around starting and finishing times and vehicles parked illegally will be ticketed.

'Any schools experiencing parking problems should speak to their school liaison officer or local neighbourhood team.'
