Leicester City have rejected approaches for striker Tom Lawrence from an astonishing nine clubs.

The former Manchester United forward has barely played for Leicester since arriving from Old Trafford in the summer but manager Nigel Pearson wants to have all options available as he battles against the odds to keep Leicester in the Premier League.

Lawrence, 21, is poised to make his full international debut for Wales in their European Championship qualifier with Israel on Saturday but has only figured in four games for Leicester this season and three as a substitute.
