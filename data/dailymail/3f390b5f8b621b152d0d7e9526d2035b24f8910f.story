The Golden State Warriors new stadium designs have led many to say the structure resembles a giant toilet - but the team says it's not the final product. 

A handful of Twitter users poked fun at the NBA team's planned Mission Bay structure as early as  August, when an aerial was released by SocketSite.

Lavatory chic? The Golden State Warriors new stadium designs have led many to say the structure resembles a giant toilet

'Toilet lid': Various Twitter users and media outlets have poked fun at the images 

Resemblance?  The new stadium will reportedly will seat 18,000 people - with both stores and office buildings in the nearby vicinity

'The New @Warriors stadium keeps it classy by keeping the toilet seat down for ladies. #ToiletPunsIncoming,' one Aug. 15 tweet read.

More tweets followed after the website released new images this week.

'The news Warriors' arena DOES look like a toilet,' a user wrote Monday. 'But a good toilet. Not bidet-level, but nice.'

'Doubt the final product will resemble the early rendering, but you'd think someone would have caught the toilet thing. #Warriors #SFArena,' someone else tweeted Monday.

Similarly, another person wrote Wednesday 'How does nobody stand up in the middle of the Warriors meeting about the new arena design and say "yo guys, that looks A LOT like a toilet".'

Center: The arena is meant to be part of a larger complex in Mission Bay 

Not finished: A spokesman for the Warriors said 'We are still very much in the conceptual design phase' 

However, Demian Bulwan, an editor at The San Francisco Chronicle said 'From ground level, the Warriors new SF arena surely wouldn't look this much like a toilet.'

SocketSite, which published the photos of the stadium, reported that it will seat 18,000 people - and that both stores and office buildings will be included in the larger complex.

A spokesman for the NBA team told MailOnline of the images 'These are not renderings, at least not in the sense that we usually mean. They're architectural drawings, presented as part of a presentation to the Mission Bay Citizens Advisory Committee last week. [...] They are works in progress, designed to facilitate the feedback from the community we're engaged in at the moment.

'We are still very much in the conceptual design phase. Detailed renderings are still to come.'
