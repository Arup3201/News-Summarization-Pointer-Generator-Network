The BBC Trust is paying one of the Corporation’s former executives a six-figure sum to conduct a secret inquiry into its stars’ earnings.

Mark Oliver’s firm Oliver & Ohlbaum Associates will investigate whether the BBC’s top ‘talent’ – including Graham Norton, Gary Lineker, Jeremy Clarkson and Fiona Bruce – is being overpaid.

More than 250 BBC employees earn at least £250,000 a year and 14 earn more than £500,000 but the BBC refuses to name them.

It is understood that Norton is the BBC’s highest earner, on £2.6million a year, with Lineker said to earn £2million a year, Clarkson £1million a year, Fiona Bruce £500,000 and Tess Daly £250,000, leading to fears that ‘talent’ salaries are out of hand.

The BBC says that it must pay such wages to keep up with commercial rivals.

Yet despite going to the expense of hiring Mr Oliver’s agency, the BBC Trust has already said some details from the report, such as ‘individual talent deals’, will remain secret, preventing licence fee-payers from knowing how much the BBC pays its stars and how these compare to those in the commercial sector.

A review is being launched to find out if the BBC's top 'talent' is being paid too much money

Girls' big payday: Fiona Bruce is thought to collect £500,000 while Strictly star Tess Daly gets £250,000,

The BBC Trust maintains the study ‘will compare the size and structure of the BBC’s reward packages with those offered by other broadcasters’. But this has triggered doubts about the ethics of employing a third party to find out what commercial rivals pay when the BBC will not reveal what its own publicly funded employees earn.

Last night Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘This doesn’t seem a reasonable use of licence-fee money.’

This is the second time the firm run by Mr Oliver – who was the BBC’s head of strategy from 1989 to 1995 – has carried out a review of stars’ pay for the BBC. In 2008, an identical exercise concluded that no employees were being overpaid.

A Freedom of Information request submitted by The Mail on Sunday to the BBC has revealed that five ‘key staff’ from Oliver & Ohlbaum will work on the project, the findings of which are expected to be published at the end of the year. In addition, an unspecified number of other employees of the firm, based in Notting Hill, west London, will assist.

The BBC has refused to say how much it is spending on the review, but an industry insider said this weekend that it is ‘easily more than £100,000’, given the number of staff involved and its scope.

A BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘The intention of this review is to ensure that licence fee-payers are getting a good deal on talent. It has never been our intention that the BBC or the Trust will have access to raw pay data of other broadcasters, and no details of individual talent deals for either the BBC or other broadcasters will be published.’
