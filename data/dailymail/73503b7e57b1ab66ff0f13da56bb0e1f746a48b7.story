Brendan Rodgers has revealed Liverpool will look to lay a new pitch at Anfield in the summer.

The Liverpool boss, who has been disappointed with the playing surface at Anfield since taking over the reins at the Merseyside outfit, believes the pitch is hampering his side's style of play.

Rodgers, who criticised the state of the pitch after his side's 2-2 draw with Arsenal, said: 'We will be getting a new pitch next summer to help the speed of our game.

'It is an old pitch that has not been upgraded for some years and it can be a disadvantage for us. It is difficult to play one-touch football on it.

'It is nothing to do with the ground staff at the club or at Melwood, who are outstanding, it is just because the pitch is old. We will do the best on it until the end of the season.'

Away from Anfield's playing surface, Rodgers insists he had not lost faith in Simon Mignolet as he backed the Belgian to return a better goalkeeper from his spell out of the side.

Liverpool's manager took the decision to remove Mignolet from his starting line-up for an 'indefinite' period ahead of the trip to Manchester United earlier this month after his performance levels dipped.

Brad Jones has taken over between the posts and Liverpool would certainly be in the market to add a goalkeeper in January if the right option became available. They have been linked with Petr Cech once more but Rodgers would not comment on his plans for the impending transfer window.

What Rodgers was eager to stress, though, was the fact Mignolet has not been frozen out and he expects the spell on the sidelines to enable the 26-year-old to regather his focus and be sharp once he decides the time is right to bring him back in.

'In terms of Brad, he has come into the team. When called upon during my time here, he has done very well,' added Rodgers.

'He is a very loyal goalkeeper. When he is asked to come in he does very well. Simon's response has been fantastic. His training has been really good. That time coming out of the team can do you good. We have been looking at the areas that he can improve.

'Sometimes that little period out can help. Brad is in the team at the moment. The one thing that impresses me is he is consistent all the way through. You need your No 2 to be loyal. He comes in and does his work religiously. 

'He is a wonderful professional so when he comes in he does his work really well. Simon has been very impressive in how he has responded. I haven't lost any belief in him. He is still a top goalkeeper.'

Rodgers is urging his players to finish 2014 with a run of victories that will enable them to attack the second half of the campaign.

He is adamant Liverpool can bridge a nine point deficit and qualify for the Champions League, especially now they have a system in place that is allowing them to attack.

When asked how he will look back on 2014, Rodgers said: 'We had a wonderful end to the season, we got better and better and exceeded expectations as we nearly won the league. The summer was busy and we lost a top player.

'The opening to this season has been less than impressive but there have been reasons. Our performance level is starting to return. We now want to finish the year with a number of wins so we can go on and attack the second half of the season.

'We are at our best when our game is aggressive. We needed to get some results after we had played against Crystal Palace. We needed to steady the ship and it was about finding a solution. We have seen that. We now have a platform to dominate the ball.'

Liverpool travel to Burnley on Boxing Day. They will be without the injured Dejan Lovren, Joe Allen and Glen Johnson as well as the suspended Fabio Borini but Mario Balotelli will return to the squad after a serving a one-match ban.
