Return to the 70s: James Caan said he had became negative about the state of the film industry

The Godfather actor James Caan has urged the film industry to ditch movie franchises and return to classic seventies dramas.

Caan, 73, who has returned to the 1970s for his role in Guillaume Canet’s latest movie Blood Ties, said the franchise films which have flooded Hollywood in recent years have left him feeling ‘negative’ about the state of the industry.  

He said: ‘I’ve become very negative about the films of today, and that’s why I leapt at the chance to do a film of the `70s with talent like this.

‘I was very fortunate in the `70s to work with the best actors, the best directors, the best cinematographers. 

‘And [the films] had a beginning, a middle and an end, which was something very odd.’ 

But
he was dismissive of Hollywood’s more modern offerings adding: ‘it 
seems like most of the films they’re doing, in Hollywood anyway, are 
these franchise films.’

Caan
is best known for his role as Sonny Corleone in The Godfather, for 
which he was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe in 1973.

In his latest role he plays another patriarch of a divided family in Canet’s Brooklyn-set drama.

His younger son, played by Billy Crudup, is a cop while his elder son, played by Clive Owen, is an ex-con trying half-heartedly to go straight. 

The film also features the actresses Marion Cotillard, Mila Kunis and Zoe Saldana.

James Caan, the son of a butcher, was born in New York and played football for Michigan State University while studying economics.

However, while studying at Hofstra University, he became intrigued by acting and was interviewed and accepted at Sanford Meisner's Neighborhood Playhouse.

He then won a scholarship to study under acting coach Wynn Handman and began to appear in several off-Broadway productions.

He made his screen debut as a sailor in Irma la Douce and began to impress audiences with his work in Red Line 7000 and the western El Dorado alongside John Wayne and Robert Mitchum.

With these strong performances under his belt, Francis Ford Coppola then cast him as hot-tempered gangster Santino 'Sonny' Corleone in the Mafia epic The Godfather in 1972. 

He reprised the role for several flashback scenes in the sequel The Godfather: Part II (1974) and then moved on to several very diverse projects. 

These included a cop-buddy crime partnership with Alan Arkin in Freebie and the Bean, a performance as a man playing for his life in The Gambler alongside Lauren Hutton and pairing with Barbra Streisand in Funny Lady in 1975.
