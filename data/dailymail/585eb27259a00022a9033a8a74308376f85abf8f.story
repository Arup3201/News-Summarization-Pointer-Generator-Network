These are the dramatic moments that coastguards carried out a 'miracle' rescue to save a stranded puppy after it plunged 40 ft off a cliff.

The six-month-old Rhodesian ridgeback, called Crouton, fell down the steep cliff while it was trying to catch a rabbit.

Crouton landed a ledge which prevented the pup from a further fall of 60 ft into the raging sea below.

Shetland coastguard teams from Durness and Melness were involved in the Highland rescue attempt

Shetland coastguard teams from Durness and Melness rushed to the incident at Durness in the north west Highlands.

They were assisted by an officer from the Scottish SPCA who oversaw the rescue. After the colossal effort, the pup escaped safe and unscathed.

Gordon Kerr, 54, a prison officer from Ayrshire who saw the rescue, said: 'I was walking around Smoo Cave when I heard a dog barking loudly.

'Originally I thought it was just a farmer's dog. As I walked a bit further I could see the coastguard were setting up - initially thinking that it was a training exercise.

'When I asked a stranger what they thought was going on, he told me that he had been out walking his dog when it bolted for a rabbit and fell 40 feet.

'It luckily managed to land on a ledge.

'It's a miracle that the dog survived. It had been down there for about three or four hours and fell down such a severe cliff but there wasn't a scratch on the wee thing.

'When the dog came back up, it started jumping around, high-fiving its owner and asking for biscuits.'

A spokesman for Melness coastguard said: 'The owner of the dog was extremely grateful for all the help provided by the Coastguard Teams and the SSPCA.

The elaborate rescue involved two coastguard team and a number of cables to ensure their safety 

The coast guard described the operation as a 'text book' rope rescue and said its teams had worked well

'It was a successful outcome with a happy ending, teams worked well together, resulting in a text book rope rescue.

'Be aware that if your dog is unfortunate enough to fall over or get stuck down a cliff, do not under any circumstances attempt a self rescue.

'Dial 999 and ask for the Coastguard, we are trained to deal with these situations. If you are walking your dog on or near to cliffs please, please, please keep it on a lead.'
