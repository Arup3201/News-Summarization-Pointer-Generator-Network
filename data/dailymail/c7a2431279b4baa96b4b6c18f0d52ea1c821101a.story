Sixteen men and women are facing lengthy prison terms for their convictions for hair-and beard-cutting attacks on fellow Amish in Ohio.

The trial focused on an internal dispute and offered a rare and sometimes lurid glimpse into the closed and usually self-regulating community of believers.

The defendants, who have about 50 children between them and include six couples, were convicted yesterday in US District Court after four days of deliberations.

A defence lawyer claimed the verdicts would destroy the Amish community of about 25 families

They had rejected plea 
deals which offered leniency, with some likely to face only probation. 
With the convictions, some could now get sentences of 20 
years or more.

Members of the defence team said 
appeals were likely and would focus on whether the beard-cuttings 
amounted to religious-based hate crimes.

Judge Dan Aaron Polster scheduled sentencing for January 24.

Prosecutors planned to file a request today to revoke bond and lock up defendants who had remained free pending trial. The judge asked the defence team to respond by Tuesday.

Rhonda Kotnik, representing Kathryn Miller, said the verdicts would destroy the Amish community of about 25 families

'The community is going to be ripped apart. I don't know what's going to happen to all their children,' she said.

Samuel Mullet Sr., 66, the leader of the breakaway group, was found guilty of orchestrating the cuttings last autumn.

The government said the cuttings were an attempt to shame members of Mullet's community, who he believed were straying from their beliefs.

His followers were found guilty of carrying out the attacks, which terrorised the normally peaceful religious settlement that aims to live simply and piously.

Prosecutors and witnesses described how sons pulled their father out of bed and chopped off his beard in the moonlight and how women surrounded their mother-in-law and cut off two feet of her hair, taking it down to the scalp in some places.

Sixteen members of an Amish group led by Samuel Mullet Sr. were charged with committing hate crimes, conspiracy, kidnapping, and 
destroying evidence for a series of beard and hair cutting attacks

Prosecutors say they targeted hair because it carries spiritual significance in their faith.

All the defendants are members of 
Mullet's settlement that he founded in eastern Ohio near the West 
Virginia panhandle.

The Amish eschew many conveniences of modern life, 
including electrical appliances and automobiles, and embrace their 
centuries-old roots.

Federal officials said the verdicts would send a message about religious intolerance.

'The victims in this case are members 
of a peaceful and traditional religion who simply wanted to be left to 
practice their religion in peace,' US Attorney Steven Dettelbach said.

'Unfortunately, the defendants denied them this basic right and they 
did so in the most violent way.'

Members of the Amish community who sat
 through the trial hurried into a hired van without commenting, some 
covering their faces.

Defence lawyers said the defendants were bewildered by the verdicts.

'They really don't understand the court system the way the rest of us 
have, being educated and reading newspapers,' said Joseph Dubyak, whose 
client, Linda Schrock, has 10 children with her husband, who was also 
convicted.

The suspects had argued that the Amish are bound by different rules 
guided by their religion and that the government had no place getting 
involved in what amounted to a family or church dispute.

Mullet wasn't accused of cutting anyone's hair.

But prosecutors said he 
planned and encouraged his sons and the others, mocked the victims in 
jailhouse phone calls and was given a paper bag stuffed with the hair of
 one victim.

The Amish community in Ohio has been shaken by 
the investigation into 16 men and women convicted of carrying out hate 
crimes by cutting hair

One bishop told jurors his chest-length beard was chopped to within one and a half 
inches of his chin when four or five men dragged him 
out of his farmhouse in a late-night home invasion.

Prosecutors told jurors that Mullet thought he was above the law and 
free to discipline those who went against him based on his religious 
beliefs.

Before his arrest last November, he defended what he believes 
is his right to punish people who break church laws.

'You have your laws on the road and the town - if somebody doesn't obey 
them, you punish them.

'But I'm not allowed to punish the church people?'
 Mullet told The Associated Press news agency last October.

The hair cuttings, he said, were a response to continuous criticism he'd
 received from other Amish religious leaders about him being too strict,
 including shunning people in his own group.

Defence lawyers acknowledged that the hair cuttings took place and 
that crimes were committed but contend that prosecutors were 
overreaching by calling them hate crimes.

Witnesses testified that Mullet had complete control over the settlement
 that he founded two decades ago and described how his religious 
teachings and methods of punishments deviated from Amish traditions.

One woman testified that Mullet coerced women at his settlement into 
having sex with him, and others said he encouraged men to sleep in 
chicken coops as punishment.

Six of the 16 people charged in the case are women, all related to the alleged ringleader

conspiracy, hate crimes and kidnapping against other members of their 
community, say the arguments were over family disputes and not hate 
crimes
