Tottenham are at last beginning to adapt to the style demanded by head coach Mauricio Pochettino.

The former Argentina international's summer arrival was greeted by excitement and expectation at White Hart Lane, although the first few months of his reign proved tumultuous.

Spurs struggled to get to grips with the exciting, high-pressing football that Pochettino became synonymous for at Southampton, but there have been some promising signs of late.

The most impressive display to date came on New Year's Day, when the north Londoners annihilated rivals Chelsea 5-3 at White Hart Lane.

'I think that we are very happy with what the team showed against Chelsea,' Pochettino said ahead of Monday's trip to Burnley in the FA Cup.

'It is not easy. You always need time to change things, but the team are starting to show what we want to see.

'We are in a process and we need to believe and build our way.

'Victories like this, means you can improve more quickly.'
