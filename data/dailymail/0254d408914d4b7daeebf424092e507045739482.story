Scandal: North Wales chief Mark Polin revealed details of the sex abuse investigation, which involved at least 140 victims over 30 years

One of Britain’s biggest child abuse scandals is likely to have been even larger than previously thought, police revealed yesterday.

Dozens of former residents of North Wales children’s homes have given detectives ‘graphic’ accounts of appalling abuse at the hands of 84 staff – most of whom have never been prosecuted.

Barely a decade after a £13million public inquiry that was meant to uncover the extent of the scandal, police yesterday revealed they had ‘significant’ new evidence of ‘serious and systemic’ abuse.

Home Secretary Theresa May ordered the new inquiry after allegations on the BBC’s Newsnight programme last November that a public inquiry which looked at the scandal had failed to uncover the full extent of the abuse.

The now-notorious Newsnight film led to Tory grandee Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in the abuse.

In their first major progress report yesterday, officers who have been sifting through the accounts of former residents of the homes revealed the appalling scale of the suspected abuse.

And they warned that abusers who believed they had evaded justice should for ever be ‘looking over their shoulders’ in fear of arrest and prosecution.

The Waterhouse Report of 2000 heard from 650 witnesses and led to the conviction of seven former care workers.

The report, by former High Court Judge Sir Ronald Waterhouse, said sexual and physical abuse mainly focused on six council-run homes and two private homes between 1994 and 1990.

Yesterday, however, Detective Superintendent Ian Mulcahey, who is leading the new investigation, Operation Pallial, revealed:

Probe: Police say a new inquiry has found that sexual abuse at North Wales care home homes, including Bryn Estyn in Wrexham (pictured), was much worse than first thought

Report: Details uncovered by the new inquiry were revealed by (l-r) Det Sup Ian Mulcahey of Merseyside Police and North Wales chief constable Mark Polin at a press conference today

Previous: High Court judge Sir Ronald Waterhouse previously looked at abuse in North Wales but today's findings show the situation was much worse than first thought

The investigation is running in 
parallel with a review of the Waterhouse Inquiry by Mrs Justice Macur. 
Many ex-residents of homes including the notorious Bryn Estyn, near 
Wrexham, have long argued that Waterhouse’s terms of reference – 
focusing on abuse within the properties – meant claims of links to a 
wider paedophile ring in the area were ignored.

But the bombshell claim by Steve 
Messham to have been abused by Lord McAlpine was discredited when he was
belatedly shown a photograph of the former Tory treasurer and conceded 
he had named the wrong man.

The furore last November led to the resignation of BBC director general George Entwistle after just 54 days in charge.

Officers working on Operation Pallial
have made one arrest so far. A man was held in Ipswich last week and 
then bailed. More arrests are expected.

Among those who have given their 
accounts of being abused to the new inquiry is Keith Gregory, who was a 
Bryn Estyn resident from 1972-74 and is now a local councillor.

None of his alleged abusers were 
prosecuted, but he has given detectives the names of four he is prepared
to testify against and predicted more ex-residents would now come 
forward.

Mr Gregory, 55, said: ‘I was worried 
it was going to be another whitewash after going through the Waterhouse 
Inquiry, so I’m very relieved.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
