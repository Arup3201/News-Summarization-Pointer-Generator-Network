Iran's footballers have been warned they could face punishment if they take selfies with female fans who have turned out in droves to see their idols play at the Asian Cup.

The head of the Iranian Football Federation's moral committee said players risked being used as a 'political tool' if snapped with female fans.

Women are banned from attending men's sports events in the Islamic republic but they have flocked to see Iran's games hosted by Australia where no such rule applies.

Head of Iranian Football Federation's moral committee, Ali Akbar Mohamedzade, issued the warning last week as photos of players with female fans circulated on social media.

'National team players should be aware that they won't be used as a political tool so that those who take pictures with them don't use these photos against the players,' Iran's Shahrvand newspaper quoted him as saying.

'So according to this they should not take photos with everyone. If the players don't respect this, we will be obliged to take action.'

However, there has not been any details on what punishment the players might face. 

Enthusiastic male and female fans of Iran, many wearing the team shirt, have been a prominent feature throughout the Asian Cup.

The scenes are a stark contrast with the situation in Iran, where women are banned from men's sports events on moral grounds.

Iran's Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz has carefully steered clear of any controversy, giving a firm 'no comment' when asked about the presence of women fans.

One female fan tweeted pictures of goalkeeper Ali Reza Haghighi and midfielder Karim Ansari Fard posing with women.

While another photo shows a woman holding an Iranian flag inscribed with a marriage proposal to Haghighi: 'Will Alireza marry me?' emblazoned across it.

The three-time champions are already through to the quarter-finals and their games have been vocally supported by thousands of fans with some banging drugs and blowing trumpets.

'We are monitoring what is happening in Australia, we haven't sent any representative to Australia,' Mohamedzade was quoted as saying.
