A desktop scanner that can create detailed 3D computers models of almost any object has gone on sale for £900 ($1,400).

When used with a 3D printer, the Makerbot Digitizer can create anything from toys to practical objects such as furniture, simply by scanning a device that’s already in existence.

The Digitizer, which claims to be able to scan eight inch objects in around 12 minutes, will be shipped to first buyers in October.

Created by New York-based 3D printing company, Makerbot, the scanner requires no special expertise or 3D modelling software knowledge. 

It works by scanning the contours on the surface of an object using several lasers.

These lasers help capture details as small as 0.5 mm, and surface depth as shallow as 0.5 mm.

The device then turns the data points into a computer model that can be used to replicate the object using a 3D printer.

The output is a standard 3D model file format (STL) and can be modified and improved in third-party 3D modelling programs, like Autodesk’s free software MeshMixer.

Users can also upload their designs to Thingiverse, a website where 3D designs can be shared.

However, the company has warned that expectations for the device should be realistic.

3D printers allow objects of any shape to be created from just a digital file.

They work in an extremely simple way, by building up a 3D object from layers of material.

Like a traditional inkjet printer, material, usually plastic, is laid down on a base.

Further layers are simply printed on top, gradually revealing a 3D object.

The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace.

Shoes, jewellery and even dresses have been created, with designs often sold online.

Many believe it could even lead to 'mini factories' for living rooms 
allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a 
replacement part for a broken household appliance.

‘You will not be able to, for example, scan a hamburger and then eat the digital design. Expectations for precision should be realistic, too. 

‘The MakerBot Digitizer is not ideal for engineers who require very high precision scanning.’

The system is also unable to scan objects with surfaces that are shiny, reflective or fuzzy.

The Makerbot Digitizer is one in a range of products attempting to break into the emerging home 3D printing market. 

Last month electronics company Maplin became the first major high-street retailer in the UK to sell 3D printers. The group is currently selling the Velleman K8200 for £700.

Tesco customers could also soon design their own items, go into a supermarket and have them printed in 3D. 

The group said it is working on developing new technology for a variety of products in its stores. Ideas include digitally making clothing, furniture, personal gifts and even food in their shops.

The Digitizer, which claims to be able to scan eight inch objects in around 12 minutes, will be shipped to first buyers in October
