For those tired of going on the same old camping holiday; struggling with tentpoles, battling ants and floods – there is a solution.

The dome-like tree house, where sleepers stay suspended in the air, is the perfect place for weary travellers to put up their feet.

The art project-come-campsite is about to open in Amsterdam, offering more unique ways of spending the night than your average camper van.

Dome dorm: Many happy campers have seen their smiles turn into frowns when ants make their way into their tents, but that can easily be avoided when sleeping in a suspended polyhedron

Airtime: The floating dome is just one option for travellers looking to stay at the Urban Campsite in Amsterdam

Swinging freeL The Boomhut, which means tree house in Dutch, sleeps two people and costs ¿60 - approximately £52 - per night

Visitors to the Viegenbos site
can choose from accommodations ranging from the suspended dome tree house 
to a floating capsule and a fold-out garden.

From August 16 to September 30, 2013 art and camping come together in Amsterdam, offering a set of unique sleep-experiences.

Urban Campsite in Amsterdam does away 
with tents, letting campers stay in provided mobile spaces, all award 
winning works of art.

There are many available 
accommodations from the domes of the Boomhuttenfest tree houses to Kevin van Braakís 
Caravan, which looks like a normal camper but folds out into an 
artificial garden, complete with stuffed animals and a sound 
system emitting bird sounds.

Captain Nemo style: The 'Capsule hotel Refunc' may not look too appealing on land but it offers a night on the waves with a submarine feel

On the outside Kevin van Braak's caravan looks like any other - but do not let the exterior fool you as it folds out and becomes a garden complete with a stuffed badger and a boombox playing bird song

It also offers the Capsule hotel 
Refunc, a ‘pod’ resembling something where Captain Nemo would lay his 
weary head to rest, that can be placed in a nearby lake.

Not only a space to camp, Urban 
Campsite is providing an entire atmosphere of community for campers with
open-air movies, dinners at long tables, outdoor theatre and temporary 
photo exhibitions.

The unique sleeping spaces range from $20-$80 euros a night and will be available to happy campers from August this year.

The Markies van by Eduard Böhtlingk follows a similar concept as the garden-caravan with its fold-out walls

Blue sky space: The Urban Campsite in Vliegenbos in Amsterdam will be open from August 11 to September 30

Tranquil space: The Markies fits four people once its gill-like sides has been folded out - and for ¿80 a night, you would be a fool not to
