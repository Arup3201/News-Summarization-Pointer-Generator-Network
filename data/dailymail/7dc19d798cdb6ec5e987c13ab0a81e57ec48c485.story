The bicycle of missing student Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick was discovered under a bridge today more than a week after she disappeared.

Fishermen found the 22-year-old's bike at Whiskey Bay on the Atchafalaya River, Louisiana. Her family were brought to the scene by police and confirmed it was her black and gold Schwinn.

The bike's condition was not released and authorities began searching the river by boat. Divers planned to go in when the current became less strong.Â

Two days prior to her bike being found, police revealed they had uncovered surveillance footage of the student riding her bike.

Two videos show the University of Louisiana student on St John Street and St Landry Street in Lafayette. In both videos a white four-door pick-up truck is seen to pass by after Miss Schunick and date from 1.47am and 1.48am when the student had left a friend's house on May 19.

'Investigators are seeking information regarding a white newer model four door pickup truck, which was captured on video after Mickey Shunick traveled on both streets,' said a statement from the Lafayette Police Department.

Police have said it has taken this long to release the new information because much of the surveillance footage had to be watched in real time and then enhanced to positively identify Miss Schunick.

'Investigators are seeking information regarding a white newer model four door pickup truck, which was captured on video after Mickey Shunick traveled on both streets,' said a statement from the Lafayette Police Department, according to ABC News.

Police have said it has taken this long to release the new information because much of the surveillance footage had to be watched in real time and then enhanced to positively identify Miss Schunick.

Investigators had found no cell phone or purse of the missing woman after she left her friend Brettly Wilson's house.

And as investigators expanded their search to include a $25,000 reward for information, some people in the area began to wonder whether she had even been abducted.

Mystery: Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick, a 22-year-old anthropology major at the University of Louisiana, was last seen leaving a friend's house

While hundreds of University of Louisiana students and some of Shunick's friends have been helping the police with their searches, the night she went missing still plays on minds.

'It's something you keeping asking ourselves, if there's something that we overlooked or something that we missed,' said Brettley Wilson.

Painting a clearer timeline of the evening, police are keen for witnesses to come forward from the Artmosphere bar that Shunick attended from 10 pm till midnight and then onwards to Wilson's house and to a Taco Bell drive-thru at around 1.24 am.

Receiving a phone call from a friend at around 1.31 am, Wilson drove Shunick to his home to collect her bike and she rode off at 1.45 am leaving Wilson.

'She checked her bike, took out her mace, made sure it was on. I walked her out, watched her get to the drive way then I closed the door and locked it,' said Wilson according to KATC

That was the last time that anyone saw her.

'Now we're able to show the family that, hey, we know she traveled to Versaille, we know she it as far as St.Landry Street, and that there was a white pick up truck in that area,' said Corporal Paul Mouton, Public Information Officer for Lafayette Police.

Support: The community in Lafayette attend a vigil to pray for the missing student

'Someone was in that immediate area when she passed on the bike so it's trying to identify with those people and getting that information back so we can hopefully get closer to finding her.'

Indeed, after seeing the white pick-up truck released by the police, new leads are already coming forward.

A local girl, Tasha Patterson claims that it is the same truck that approached her two months ago while she was riding her bike down South College around 2 pm.

She says that after heading back from a meeting a man in a white truck pulled over and asked if she needed a ride.

Patterson says she was exhausted and was not thinking clearly and got in.

Throughout the car ride the man apparently offered her money in return for sex, an offer which she refused.

Dropping her off unharmed, Patterson described the truck as a white GMC Sierra 2500 Texas Edition and during the journey told her matter-of-factly that: 'He rides around town all the time trying to pick up pretty girls'.

The driver was described as white, heavyset and in his 50's or 60's.
