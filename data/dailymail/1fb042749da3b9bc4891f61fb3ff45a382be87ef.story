Smiles turned to frowns on Wall Street today as the Dow retreated after crossing 13,000 for the first time since before the financial crisis began.

Its last time above 13,000 during a trading day was May 20 in 2008, four months before the Lehman Brothers investment bank went under.

The Dow Jones first passed 13,000 two hours into the trading day after a long-awaited bailout deal for Greece, before it fell back to close at 12,966.

On the floor: In a market built on perception, the milestone could influence more cautious investors to pump more money back into the stock market

The deal on Tuesday was aimed at 
preventing a potentially catastrophic default. It came amid strong 
corporate earnings reports in the U.S.

The Dow hit 13,000 at 11:30am and stayed there for 30 seconds, then dropped back. It reclaimed the level again at noon and just after 1:30pm.

But it gave up most of its gains for the
day and finished up 16 at 12,966. The S&P 500 rose a point to 1,362
but the Nasdaq fell three to 2,949.

The last time the Dow Jones was above 13,000, the unemployment rate in the U.S. was 5.4 per cent, far below today's 8.3 per cent.

The Great Recession was six months 
old, with the worst still to come. The 13,000 level is generally seen a 
psychological milepost.

However in a market built on perception, 
it could influence more cautious investors to pump more money back into 
the stock market, analysts said.

‘You need notches along the way to 
measure things, and that's as good as any,’ said analyst John Manley of Wells Fargo's funds group.

‘Is 50 older than 49 and a half? Yes, 
by six months. Do those six months really make a difference? Probably 
not. But it does give us a fixed point.’

Five years: The Dow's last time above 13,000 during a trading day was May 20 in 2008, four months before the Lehman Brothers investment bank went under

Fluctuations: The last time the Dow Jones industrial average was above 13,000, the unemployment rate was 5.4 per cent, far below today's 8.3 per cent

Last summer the Dow Jones unburdened itself of 2,000 points in three terrifying weeks. It fell as low as 10,655 in the autumn.

That came as investors panicked after a
downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and a fight over the federal 
government's borrowing limit.

The 13,000 marker is a 22 per cent 
rally from that low and it’s within 1,200 points of the record closing 
high - 14,164 on October 9 in 2007.

Under the bailout deal, Greece will 
get €130billion, or $172billion, from other European nations and 
the International Monetary Fund.

It will also owe €107billion less to 
investors who own its government bonds. European markets fell after the 
Greece deal was announced.

After months of the talks crawling 
along, the conclusion was almost anticlimactic, with an agreement 
already expected by the markets.

Stocks were down almost 4 per cent in 
Greece, a little more than 1 per cent in Spain and less than 1 per cent 
in France and Britain.

But the euro rose slightly at $1.32, 
which may be a sign of confidence in Europe's markets. Investors noted 
that Greece remains in deep recession.

Its private-sector investors were also
forced to take a 53.5 per cent loss on the face value of their bonds, 
which could discourage future investment.

The U.S. stock market has climbed 
steadily this year thanks to optimism about the economy, but high petrol
prices are becoming a concern.

A gallon of regular costs $3.57 on average, 40 cents more than a year ago and the highest on record for this time of year.

With tension building over Iran's 
nuclear ambitions, it has halted oil exports to Britain and France and
threatened to stop shipping to others in Europe.

U.S. markets enjoyed strong earnings 
reports from Home Depot and Dollar Thrifty. But Wal-Mart reported a 15 
per cent drop in quarterly profits.
