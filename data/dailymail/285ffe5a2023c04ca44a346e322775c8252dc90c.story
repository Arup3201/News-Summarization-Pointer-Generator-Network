Justine Miliband is to hit the campaign trail without husband Ed today in a move which will dramatically raise her profile.

The environmental lawyer will climb aboard Labour’s battlebus in Glasgow to urge voters to reject Scottish independence. 

In an unusual development, Mr Miliband will not be by her side, in what will be seen as a trial run for his wife to play a central role in next year’s general election campaign.

Justine and Ed Miliband were at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games last night, but today she will be campaigning against Scottish independence on her own

Labour strategists believe Mrs Miliband is a major asset to her husband’s chances of becoming Prime Minister next year.

The child actress-turned-barrister has made clear her intention to join the political battle, telling a Labour fundraiser recently: ‘I am up for a fight, however nasty, however brutal.’

She has vowed to be ‘on the barricades’, telling activists during last year’s party conference: ‘I am in fact more than a dress.’

The Milibands were in Glasgow last night for the spectacular opening of the Commonwealth Games, and were pictured laughing and applauding during the often-bizarre show.

Today Mrs Miliband will focus on the more serious matter of protecting the future of the 300-year-old Union.

Amid concern that the No camp in the referendum campaign has been too dour and negative, she will join Labour activists to tour the city on a bus before going door-to-door canvassing.

A Labour source said: ‘She is up in Scotland and wanted to take part in a bit of Better Together campaigning. Like lots of people in Labour, she feels strongly that the UK should stick together.

'It is a big question on the future of our country and she wants to take part in the campaign.

First Minister Alex Salmond has broken his promise not to politicise the Commonwealth Games quicker than a Usain Bolt sprint - by declaring Glasgow the 'Freedom City'.

As Scotland's athletes prepared for the 11 biggest days of their lives, the First Minister resorted to his well-worn 'Braveheart' rhetoric.

He claimed he was confident Glasgow would vote Yes in the referendum - while in the same breath insisting he would not use the Games as a campaigning pawn.

However, the intense international focus during the Games and the prospect of Scotland competing directly with England, means that the politics of independence will never be far from the minds of voters.

Mrs Miliband is no stranger to the cameras. As a teenager, she carved out a career as an actor, starring in the ITV series Dramarama, which ran from 1983 and helped launch the careers of talent including writer Kay Mellor and actor David Tennant.

She also appeared in 1987 school-based sitcom Hardwicke House, which was axed after just two episodes after being mauled by critics.

Labour advisers were delighted with the reaction to a rare joint public appearance by the Milibands in the run-up to last year’s local elections.

The couple embarked on a visit to her old school in Nottingham, where the Labour leader admitted that his ‘troublemaker’ wife would have been ‘too cool’ for him.

Meeting staff at pupils at West Bridgford School, it was revealed Mrs Miliband broke the rules numerous times while she was a pupil in the 1980s.
