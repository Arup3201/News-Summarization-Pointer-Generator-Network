Step aside Gwyneth Paltrow, there's a new healthy-eating beauty in town as Britain's sexiest female vegan has been named as Jenna McGuinness.

The 24-year-old from Glasgow has won the unusual title after beating competition from around the country to win the contest, organised by animal rights charity PETA.

Model Jenna admits it was the film Babe that inspired her to change her eating habits when she was just five-years-old.

Victory: Jenna McGuinness has been named the sexiest female vegan of 2014

Ditched meat and dairy aged five: The 24-year-old was compelled to become a vegan after watching the film Babe

After becoming enamored with the screen pig, she ditched meat, milk and eggs and encouraged her family do to the same. So how did her mother react to her rejecting such foods at such a young age?

'My mum found it easy changing
 all of our diets, as she grew up next to a slaughterhouse so didn't 
feel comfortable eating meat anyway,' Jenna explains. 'To be honest I think it's weird that people still eat meat at all. There are so many choices out there.'

Health benefits: Jenna said being vegan has given her good skin, thicker hair and a slim figure

She added: 'I'm happy with a bowl of mango, 
strawberries and figs, but if I want comfort food, I go with salt and 
chilli tofu and broccoli stir-fried with garlic.'

Blonde Jenna said she entered the competition to prove that vegans are 'normal' but never expected to win.

She said: 'I know people have certain ideas about vegans so I hope this competition shows that we are just normal people. I don't actually think I'm that sexy but I thought I'd give it a go. I just can't believe I actually won.'

The association of chartered certified accountants employee credits her veganism for her good looks.

Sexiest male: Gareth Lloyd took the men's title following a public vote

Compassionate: The former soldier is now a wildlife artist

She said: 'It's mostly ethical reasons I'm a vegan but the health benefits alone would make me stay on this diet. I have much more energy, my skin has improved, my hair is thicker and I've lost weight - although that wasn't really an aim for me.'

Meanwhile, the title of sexiest vegan male was awarded to former soldier Gareth Lloyd, 27, who turned vegan after witnessing suffering in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Now a wildlife artist, Gareth, from Oxford, posts about animal rights issues on social media.

He said: 'Seeing the violence humans inflict upon each other is yet another reason I've chosen to live as peacefully as I can by being vegan.

'The sheer number of animals suffering for our stomachs is far greater than any other cause I've supported, and as such, I feel it deserves the most urgent attention. What could be sexier than a man who puts compassion first?'

Competition: Sophia Attwood-Clarke, 23, from Loughborough was a finalist

Better luck next time: Byron Higgins, 29, from Colchester, gunned for extra votes with the cunning use of a cute baby prop

The winner were chosen by a public vote after PETA whittled down the entrants to eight finalists (four men and four women).

The
 two winners will each receive a night for two and lunch at the Lancrigg
 Vegetarian Country House Hotel in Grasmere, Cumbria, plus a vegan 
dinner for two at Cumbria's Zeffirellis restaurant.

PETA
 UK Associate Director Mimi Bekhechi said: 'On average, vegans are 
healthier and have more energy than meat-eaters do - and that makes them
 sexier, too.

'Congratulations
 to our two winners. But in our book, all the entrants are winners. They
 are enjoying all the health benefits of vegan food while living 
compassionately every day.'

The other female entrants were Sophia Attwood-Clarke, 23, from Loughborough, who describes herself as, 'a cat lady, artist, adventurer and soldier in the karma army'.

Animal lovers: Lisa-Marie Williams, 24, from Dundee, left, and Kate Laycy, 
33, from Manchester were also in the running for the title

Male runners-ups: Seth Taggart, 40, from Brighton, left, and Matthew Oakes, 26, from Staffordshire

In the Mancunian corner, Kate Laycy, 
33, currently working in London as an actress said: 'I'm an animal 
loving, green tea obsessed, bikram gal - and a vegan forever!'

Whilst their Dundee Rival, Lisa-Marie Williams, 24, hopes and believes that one day all animals will be treated as equals.

For
 the men, Gareth took the crown against rivals Byron Higgins, 29, from 
Colchester; Seth Taggart, 40, from Brighton; and Matthew Oakes, 26, from
 Staffordshire - all proud vegans and animal rights advocates.

According to PETA, vegansim is on the up.

'We've had a huge increase in entries this year and there's definitely been more interest in veganism in the UK,' said PETA spokesperson Ben Williamson.

'Bill Clinton, Jared Leto and Al Gore are all vegan, as well as other celebrities, which may have an influence.'

'And this year the first vegan supermarket, currently a success in Germany, will be opening in the UK too.'

'There
 are not only ethical but environmental benefits too. The livestock 
sector is the highest contributor to greenhouse gases -- even more than 
the transport industry.

'So organisations like the U.N. are now encouraging a shift towards veganism.'
