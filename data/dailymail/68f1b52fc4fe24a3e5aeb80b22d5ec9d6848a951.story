Major US museums have banned selfie sticks because they say that the gadget is distracting patrons from the exhibits.

Institutions like the Museum of Modern Art in New York are also fearful that the stick could lead to people damaging paintings.

Curators have watched dozens of near misses as visitors shove the stick out in front of them, narrowly missing priceless works of art.

Selfie sticks are extendable poles that clip onto smart phones and allow users to take a picture of themselves.

They have become popular over the last year and among tourists who have used them to take pictures in places like the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

But now there is a mounting backlash and in New York the Museum of Modern Art, the Cooper-Hewitt and the Smithsonian Design Museum have banned the gadget.

The Guggenheim has also banned selfie sticks and the Metropolitan Museum of Art is reportedly considering a ban.

Visitors are being told that the device falls under the umbrella of ‘additional equipment or devices other than handheld cameras’ that have long been prohibited.

Jennifer Northrup, a spokeswoman for the Cooper-Hewitt and Smithsonian Design Museum, said: ‘You can, just by looking at (it) imagine the havoc a selfie stick might wreak in this kind of space.

‘They could pose a danger to visitors or our objects on view’.

Elsewhere in America the the Getty Center in Los Angeles and the Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington DC have banned selfie sticks as well.

Julie Jaskol, the assistant director of media relations at Getty, said: ‘Selfie sticks are restricted out of concern about damaging the art or people in more enclosed spaces’.

In the UK Tottenham Hotspur became the first Premiership football club to outlaw the gadget because it could be used as an ‘offensive weapon’.

Arsenal followed suit soon after.
