Caroline Wozniacki said underwear checks by Wimbledon officials were 'creepy'

Caroline Wozniacki yesterday branded the underwear checks by Wimbledon officials as ‘creepy.’

The ex-fiancée of Rory McIlroy hit out after players claimed enforcing the all-white dress code risked compromising their dignity. 

Some have been forced to go bra-less because of the stricter rule, while others have protested that white knickers under a white dress creates a see-through effect when they sweat.

Ms Wozniacki admits she wears white underwear at Wimbledon but said: ‘I don’t think anyone is showing off their underwear [but] getting it checked would be pretty creepy.’

The All England Club introduced tighter guidelines this year after concerns that sponsors were weaving more colour into kit.

Under the tougher regulations, every article of clothing needs to be white - leaving no room for misinterpretation.

Czech player Barbora Zahlavova Strycova said: ‘We’re playing in white so we should wear white underwear but it’s weird officials coming and checking. I think it’s strange.’

Former champion Pat Cash said  this week that some women players had been ordered back to change their bras and tops because of a slight colour on them, and without suitable sports bras  to hand they had to go without them.  

Swiss player Belinda Bencic, who won her second round match yesterday, supported the clampdown.

‘I have always tried to wear white underpants,’ she said.

‘White at Wimbledon is a nice tradition, so I think it is really nice to do that.’

Maria Sharapova was able to wear orange underwear last year but now the all-white rule leaves no room for interpretation
