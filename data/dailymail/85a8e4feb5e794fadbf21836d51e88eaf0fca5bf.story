As the second Republic of Ireland training session of the week wound down on Tuesday, a number of giddy international footballers lined up at the edge of the penalty box for a bit of shooting practice.

Robbie Brady, showing no ill-effects from the thigh injury which had threatened his involvement, made a beeline for the head of the queue, while Wes Hoolahan, Jonathan Walters, Shane Long, Anthony Stokes, Stephen Quinn and Kevin Doyle all waited their turn to receive a pass from Steve Guppy and fire a volley at one of the four goalkeepers in the squad.

Taking his place at the end of the line was new boy Harry Arter.

The 25-year-old has bided his time to reach this juncture in his career, so he could wait another few moments to take on Shay Given between the sticks. Up he stepped and, with his new teammates watching on, the Bournemouth star found the net.

It was greeted with roars of delight and the shots kept coming.

Arter may have been happy to take his place at the back of the queue but he will put his best foot forward to earn a place in Martin O'Neill's plans for Poland on Sunday.

'I've been picked because the manager was impressed with the way I play and if I come here and I'm not confident, then I won't show the best of my ability,' explained Arter.

'So be yourself, that's what you're picked for.

'It was a little bit nerve-wrecking meeting the lads for the first time but I've settled in really quick and they made me feel welcome. As much as it's daunting the first time, as soon as you find your feet and introduce yourself it's normal really.'

O'Neill had a brief chat with his latest recruit before the session to see if he knew any of those involved in the squad, but Arter is coming in with no previous relationships built up.

He isn't a total outsider, though. The English-born midfielder, whose grandparents hail from Sligo, represented Ireland at Under 17 and U19 level and always pined for the green jersey over the three lions, despite advances from England to join their underage set-up when he was a promising academy player at Charlton Athletic.

'I chose my country then and that was to stay with Ireland. They gave me the opportunity to play at international level at 15 and I was really thankful for that. I learned a lot from that experience and from then on I was always going to stick with Ireland.'

On his last appearance for the U19s in 2007, he was sent off against Portugal, and his club career also took a nose dive when he was released by Charlton and dropped out of the Football League to rebuild his confidence with Woking.

'Playing international football was out of the question. In my head, it wasn't even something I spoke about,' Arter, who has a solid sounding board in brother-in-law and former England international Scott Parker, remembered. Then he signed for Bournemouth five years ago and the club have risen to top of the Championship with Arter a key component of their midfield.

'Realistically, I think this is the best time for me to come. It's the best time I've been ready for the opportunity. As much as it was at the back of my mind a few years ago, it was something I was hoping for in the recent months.'

Arter's experience of life in the doldrums has helped shape his current outlook on the game and fighting his way back from obscurity means he is now relishing rather than fearing the next stage in his career.

'There are probably loads of players who go to non-league and end up staying there.

'It's easy, when you're down at that level, to blame other things or point the finger at other people as to why you are there, but there's a reason for it, you have failed at the level you were at and you have to prove yourself again.

'One thing I felt I had to do was work hard, and I am doing that now, working hard to try and achieve my goals. The key to success is working hard.'

'James McCarthy is a top player and he's at the level that I want to eventually get to,' he continued. 'These players have earned the right to play in the Premier League and have the international experience which I haven't had yet. I still have a bit of learning to do.'
