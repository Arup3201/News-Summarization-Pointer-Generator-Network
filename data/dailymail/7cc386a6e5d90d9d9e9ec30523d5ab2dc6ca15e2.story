Technology figures Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have completed the ALS ice bucket challenge.

Musk, of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, was captured in a video uploaded to the latter's YouTube page Saturday.

Musk stands under a tree in the short clip, with buckets of icy water attached to a circle-shaped object in its branches.

His children pull strings attached to the bucket, splashing the water down on Musk.

Musk was nominated to complete the ice bucket challenge by Bill Gates.

An ice bucket challenge nominee is 
taped pouring water down onto his or her head, then posts the video 
online and nominates others to do the name, The Boston Globe explained. The challenge must be 
completed within 24 hours, and if not the nominee donates $100 to an ALS-based charity.

People with ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) lose the ability to move their muscles over time and and there is no cure, according to The ALS Association.

MailOnline earlier reported that Gates, in a separate video, was shown designing and building his own metal structure to pour water down on himself.

'I want to do it better than it's been done,' Gates said in his video.

Gates also nominated Ryan Seacrest and Chris Anderson of TED for the ice bucket challenge.

Both men have since accepted and posted videos of their attempts.

Meanwhile, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' ice bucket challenge was published on his company's YouTube page Friday. He was nominated by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. 

Bezos, seen at a company meeting, joked with an audience and said he had to mull over who else to nominate.

'I've been following this ice bucket challenge and I find it totally amazing,' Bezos said.

Bezos mentioned he considered nominating NSA leaker Edward Snowden - but that 'If he takes the ice bucket challenge, it'll just leak,' he said to laughter from the audience.

Who to pick? Bezos said he had trouble thinking of who to nominate for the challenge, but settled on former Star Trek actors William Shatner, Patrick Stewart and George Takei

He also ruled out Queen Elizbeth II and Pope Francis.

'This'll never work - these people wear hats,' Bezos said.

Bezos also said he decided not to nominate Kim Jong-un, citing his aversion to social media.

Finally, Bezos nominated former Star Trek actors William Shatner, Patrick Stewart, and George Takei before standing in an inflatable pool and splashed a bucket onto his head.

Other celebrities have recently participated in the ice bucket challenge.

MailOnline earlier reported that Taylor Swift, who was taped in a video with Jaime King and a large group of people behind them, nominated Selena Gomez, Ed Sheeran and Emma Stone.

Gomez - who was also nominated by Ryan Seacrest - posted a video to Instagram that showed her taking the ice bucket challenge.
