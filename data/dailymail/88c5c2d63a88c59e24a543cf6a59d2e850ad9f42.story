Sexual objects: Aaron Thomas accused of being the East Coast Rapist has revealed having seen women as objects to him while facing trial for 17 sexual assaults over a decade

The man suspected behind more than a dozen rape cases along the East Coast says he doesn't know why he couldn't but admits his victims were only objects to him.

Aaron Thomas, 41, has revealed that his victims, at least 17 confirmed and a dozen more feared, were objects picked off the street and that he doesn't think he is crazy, but that something is wrong with him.

'It’s awful. It’s scary. ... I don’t know why I couldn’t just stop,' Thomas told the Washington Post in a series of jailhouse interviews. ‘It’s something not right because people are getting hurt.’

After the attacks spanning nearly two decades leaving residents fearful of going about their everyday lives, Thomas is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday to the abduction of three women trick-or-treating in 2009 on Halloween night.

He is also expected to plead guilty in rapes both in Prince William County and Loudoun County in 2001.

In the aftermath of the Halloween attack, hearing his two victims speak at a preliminary hearing, was what Thomas said made him realize the despicable nature of his crimes.

Series of attacks: Thomas was arrested in early 2011 after a multi-state effort to catch the man reported being responsible for rapes in Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut and Rhode Island

Caught: A U.S. Marshal said a tip directed them to Thomas prompting them to track him for several days before taking a cigarette butt he discarded and claiming his DNA was linked to the cases

‘It was terrible,’ Thomas told the Post of that hearing where the court saw him rest his head on the table as his victims recounted the attack in stomach-twisting detail. ‘I was melting in my seat. I was disgusted.’

Thomas was arrested in Connecticut in March 2011 after a multi-state law effort to catch a man believed responsible for rapes and other attacks on 17 women since 1997 in Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut and Rhode Island.

A prosecutor told the court that when Thomas was arrested he asked police: 'Why haven't you picked me up sooner?'

Police have since feared there could be many more rape victims, based on the FBI profile of a serial sexual offender.

Detective John Kelly of Fairfax County Police, Virginia, said: 'It could be as much as a dozen more.' He said serial criminals typically have twice as many victims as have been reported.

Thomas was placed on suicide watch after it was revealed he had tried to hang himself in his cell just 24 hours after his arrest.

DNA from a cigarette butt taken from Thomas has been linked to DNA at the scene of the attacks.

Thomas, who lives in New Haven, has been charged with first-degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor and is being held on $1million bond.

Authorities in Prince George's County, Maryland, are charging him with being a fugitive as well as rape and abduction counts and use of a firearm while committing a felony.

U.S. Marshal Joe Faughnan said a tip from the County directed them to Thomas. They tracked him for several days, before taking a cigarette butt he had discarded and claiming his DNA was linked to the cases.

Mark Magaw, acting police chief, Prince George's County said: 'It was a week when the predator became the prey.'

The hunt for the East Coast rapist which began in 1997 had become desperate. He eluded authorities for years despite committing a string of high-risk outdoor attacks.

The predator wore a mask or hooded sweatshirt to conceal his face in some assaults, investigators say.

He typically approached women outdoors on foot and threatened them with a knife or a handgun. His last known attack was the one on Halloween night in Woodbridge, Virginia.

During a hunt by police, 700 suspects were interviewed and cleared of involvement.

At the time released sketches of the wanted man, followed by the launch of a website for information generated 44,000 hits within 12 hours.

Victims responded to news of the arrest with tears of relief, revealed Detective Kelly. He added: 'They are just extremely happy to have accountability.'

Thomas was not entirely unknown to law enforcement: He had been arrested in September in Woodbridge, Connecticut, on a larceny charge and was released on $1,000 bond, according to public records.

He had lived previously at addresses in Maryland and Virginia, records also show.

Attacks happened in Prince Georges County, Maryland in 1997, 1998 and 2001, in Fairfax County, Virginia in 1998, 2000 and 2001, in Leesburg, Virginia in 2001, in Cranston, Rhode Island in 2006, in New Haven in 2007 and in Prince William County, Virginia in 2009.
