Luxury French label Louis Vuitton has launched a new tote, and it doesn't appear to be very practical.

The leather bag, which costs $2,790 and is printed with Louis Vuitton's classic LV monogram design, features three large 'frayed asymmetric cut-outs,' better known as holes, on either side.

Designed by Comme des Garçons founder Rei Kawakubo as part of the brand's Iconoclasts collection, it comes with a fabric insert to prevent your belongings spilling out - the same sort of drawstring dust bag traditionally used to store and protect the outside of an expensive tote, not line the inside.

Holey Moly! The leather bag, which costs $2,790 and was guest-designed by Comme des Garçons creator Rei Kawakudo, features three large 'frayed asymmetric cut-outs,' better known as holes, on either side

'[Rei Kawakubo], creator of Comme des Garçons, applies her radical, refined aesthetic to a House icon... with boldly conceived asymmetrical cut-outs and raw-edged details to produce this provocative Bag with Holes,' the website description reads.

'Sleek and capacious, the bag is a natural for travel in durable Monogram canvas. The practical insert pouch keeps belongings secure.'

And Ms Kawakubo's design isn't the only unusual offering from the Iconoclasts all-star line-up.

Celebrated shoe designer Christian Louboutin created a very extravagant gold-studded shopping cart, complete with his signature red accents - yours for $23,300.

'It abounds with delightful details and allusions, from the rounded Toron handles and red calf-hair back panel, to the brass corners inspired by House trunks and the metal Siamoise ornament that is so Louboutin,' its description reads.

And a collection featuring the term 'icon' wouldn't be complete without participation from Chanel legend Karl Lagerfeld.

The eccentric designer has crafted a five-piece range themed around boxing, with chain-strapped totes starting at $3,400 and a 'price upon application' life-sized trunk; one of only 25 made.

'[Mr Lagerfeld's] Boxing Trunk is fitted with a signature punching bag and stand, while a separate suitcase, also in Monogram, holds boxing gloves and a mat.

'With its capacious interior and removable shelving, the trunk can also serve as a chic travel closet.'

Definitely worth the money then.
