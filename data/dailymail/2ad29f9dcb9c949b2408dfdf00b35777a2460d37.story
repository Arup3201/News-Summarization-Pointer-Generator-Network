Founder: Dr Philip Nitschke believes it is a 'fundamental right' for anyone to take their own life

A ‘suicide club’ that provides advice and equipment to help people kill themselves has been set up in Britain.

Exit International, which campaigns to legalise euthanasia, has opened a London office to ‘cope with demand’ after its UK membership hit 1,000.

The group, which charges members a fee to access online information and attend workshops to discuss ‘peaceful’ methods of suicide, has attracted fierce criticism in Australia, where it was originally set up.

Unlike other advocates of assisted 
dying, Exit does not campaign only on behalf of the terminally ill.

It 
also aims to help older people simply ‘tired of life’ kill themselves 
using drugs or gas, in what it terms ‘rational suicide’.

Its activities include:

However,
 opponents of euthanasia – and even some supporters – say Exit’s 
approach is ‘dangerous’, with one warning its spread here will lead to 
‘endless tragedies’.

Exit has already been implicated in 
the death of Yorkshire grandmother Anne Veasey, who had multiple 
sclerosis.

The group’s Ireland director, Tom Curran, was interviewed by 
police over her death in 2012, but never charged.

Although
 assisting or encouraging suicide is illegal in Britain,  the law has 
been tested by campaigners seeking the right to end their lives when 
they choose.

Next month a 
bill to allow doctors to help patients take their lives in certain 
circumstances is to be debated in the House of Lords.

Exit
 UK’s ‘inaugural event’ is to be held next Saturday in London.  It is 
free to attend for members, who pay around £60 a year, while non-members
 are required to pay a one-off fee of around £50.

The
 group was set up by Australian doctor Philip Nitschke, who believes it 
is a ‘fundamental right’ for anyone to take their lives when they want. 
Restricting access to suicide method information is ‘censorship’, he 
argues.

'Dr Death': Dr. Nitschke holds a demonstration at a 'suicide convention'

Exit claims to limit membership and information to those over 50, who have no history of depression or mental illness.

It only lets in younger people if they have a serious pressing reason, such as a terminal illness.

But The Mail on Sunday found no proof of age or clean mental health was required to access its e-handbook, a guide to suicide.

It
 was guarded by only ticking a terms and conditions box.

The T&Cs 
state ‘that you are aged over 50 years and / or seriously ill’ and ‘have
 never been diagnosed with a mental disorder’.

Dr
 Nitschke said yesterday the fact that a few depressed people could use 
Exit was outweighed by the ‘benefit’ it brought to others.

It ‘should 
not be used to stop people who have a legitimate need for this 
information’, he added.

But 
Tory Peer Lord Alton, who has campaigned against assisted suicide, said:
 ‘If you can end up with a lethal pill, through a simple tick-box 
method, that is going to lead to endless tragedies. It is downright 
irresponsible.’

Kevin 
Fitzpatrick, of the anti-euthanasia group Not Dead Yet, said: ‘This is a
 suicide club, in that you have to pay membership fees.

'Nitschke is not 
only playing on people’s emotions, but he is profiting from them.’
