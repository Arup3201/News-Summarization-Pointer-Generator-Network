There is a South American takeover going on in Manchester.

They might like the taste of a Manchester Egg, or the feel of drizzly rain so thick it soaks you through. Or perhaps Oasis are big on that side of the Atlantic. Whatever the answer, South Americans are flocking to a city in the North West of England.

The Manchester derby on Sunday will bring together potentially 11 players from South America at United and City, ranging from Argentina to Brazil to Colombia.

There could well be a record set for the most amount of South Americans starting a Premier League match – currently standing at seven in the fixture between Manchester City and Tottenham last year. The record amount to feature over the course of a game is eight, when United played QPR earlier this season.

Sportsmail takes a look at who they are and who is most likely to have the biggest impact on the match...

Sergio Aguero (Argentina) - City

The striker has fired two blanks in his last two matches, but that has barely put a dent in his scintillating goalscoring form this season. Eleven goals in 13 appearances in all competitions, eight in his last seven, joint-top scorer in the Premier League with Diego Costa. He will be favourite to net the winner.

Angel di Maria (Argentina) - United

Seven games into his Manchester United career and Di Maria is already proving to be the man to pull the strings from midfield for his side – as well as wading in with three goals. The £60million summer signing will be crucial to United's chances of beating their bitter rivals.

Radamel Falcao (Colombia) - United

We are yet to see much of the frightening finishing of the forward since he joined United, with only one goal so far. But those who have played with Falcao speak of one of the most lethal penalty area strikers. There is a reason the 28-year-old has commanded more than £100m in fees.

Radamel Falcao could return from injury to play in his first Manchester derby

Fernandinho (Brazil) - City

The Brazilian has been shouldering the burden of Yaya Toure's passive displays this season. His box-to-box running has tried to create the energy to drive City forward as well as providing cover at the back. They will need him to run tirelessly, yet again, if Toure fails to perform.

Pablo Zabaleta (Argentina) - City

On his day, Zabaleta can be as dangerous as any winger from right back. He has the stamina to get up and down that flank for the entire 90 minutes and pose a real threat to United's goal, as well as proving just as difficult to beat at the back.

Marcos Rojo (Argentina) - United

Questions have been asked of the defender's ability since Louis van Gaal brought him in to help the club's defensive problems. He will face another huge task up against Aguero on Sunday. If he is not on top of his game, it could be an embarrassing afternoon.

Rafael (Brazil) - United

The Brazilian has been preferred at right back since Van Gaal switched to playing four at the back instead of three with two wing backs. At times, he can be a real aid to United's attack, picking out team-mates with crosses. But by equal measure, he can be a liability, too. Which Rafael will turn up?

Fernando (Brazil) - City

Unlikely that he will start at the same time as Fernandinho, but if he plays, Fernando will be required to put in the same hard graft as his international counterpart. Yet to prove his worth since moving from Porto in the summer.

Manchester City's Fernando, in action at West Ham, is unlikely to start on Sunday alongside Fernandinho

Martin Demichelis (Argentina) - City

Demichelis appears to be getting edged out of the team by summer signing Eliaquim Mangala but the new man's inconsistent displays for City mean the Argentine could be due to start at centre back in such an important match. Often the target for flak, Demichelis was an asset for City in their title-winning campaign last season and could yet frustrate United.

Willy Caballero (Argentina) - City

Extremely unlikely he will play and is instead expected to watch from the bench. The goalkeeper has only been preferred once to Joe Hart in the league, against Hull, and has conceded seven goals in his four appearances in all competitions.

Antonio Valencia (Ecuador) - United

Valencia is recovering from a hamstring injury which ruled him out of their 1-1 draw with Chelsea. But he has been back in training with United and Van Gaal often called on him at the start of the season. This game will perhaps come too early for a starting place.
