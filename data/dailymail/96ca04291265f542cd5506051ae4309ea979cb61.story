Majorca is planning to kick out the drunken tourists and attract instead better behaved - and higher-spending - holidaymakers.

The Spanish holiday island, which has long been a favourite destination for binge-drinking Brits and Germans, is to introduce a 24-hour public drinking ban in a bid to get rid of the boozing, brawling tourists.

Instead, Majorcan officials wish to turn the island into an upmarket holiday destination like St Tropez or Miami and attract well-heeled visitors from China and Dubai.

Drunken: Scenes like this will be a distant memory under Majorca's plans to take the holiday island upmarket

Alvaro Gijon, deputy mayor of the island's capital Palma, said he wanted to transform Majorca's image by upgrading hotels, building new, smarter, restaurants, and developing a glitzy new casino.

In particular he wants to target the four-mile Playa de Palma strip just outside the capital, banning drinking there and turning it into a destination for gastronomy and sports facilities rather than drinking buckets of sangria on sunloungers.

In an interview with the German newspaper Bild, Sr Gijon said: 'Booze tourism is out of date: if people want to get drunk they should do it in the discos, not on the beach in public.

'We want people who are going to spend a lot of money.'

A ban on drinking in public has been introduced this summer between 10am and 1pm, and Sr Gijon said he hoped it would send the right message to the drunken tourists he intend to get rid of, particularly in the Ballermann zone of bars favoured by binge-drinking Germans.

'There are other places in the world for them', he said.

'I wouldn't go to Ballermann with my six-year-old daughter, I wouldn't feel safe, not least because of the shards of glass.'

Under the plans for the island, a consortium will oversee a five or six-year development of Playa de Palma, closing down many of the budget hotels and replacing them with more expensive, luxurious accommodation.

The public drinking ban will be extended to 24-hours, and the hotels will be four or five-star, to attract a higher spending crowd.

More than half the population of Majorca, in the Balearic Islands, works in the tourism sector, which accounts for around 80 per cent of its GDP.

Around six million tourists visit the island each year, the vast majority of them British or German.
