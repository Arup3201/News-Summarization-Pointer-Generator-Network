With nine different outfits during her stint hosting the American Country Awards, viewers had little time to focus on Kristin Chenoweth’s wardrobe choices.

But there was one outfit that was certainly a cut above the rest, which no doubt the audience won’t be forgetting any time soon.

The diminutive star brought plenty of holiday cheer to the proceedings when she slipped into a sexy Santa costume.

Scroll down for full list of winners & video

Sexy Santa: Kristin Chenoweth wore a festive outfit as part of her hosting duties for the American Country Awards

The Odd Couple: The audience chose Kristin to play Santa and her well-built co-host Trace Adkins to dress as an elf

The outfit consisted of a sequined silver top and velvet red skirt, with festive fur trim and a traditional hat.

Kristin was sporting the ensemble after winning a Twitter battle with her co-host Trace Adkins, in which they asked viewers to decide who should dress as Santa and who should be the elf by tweeting a particular hashtag.

The result was a picture: petite Kristin perched on the lap of Trace, dressed as an elf while towering over her.

All-out glamour: Kristin arrived in a cobalt blue gown and left in a gold creation, sporting nine outfits in total

Look familiar?: At one point Kristin emerged onstage dressed as Honey Boo Boo

Great chemistry: Kristin and Trace made for a fantastic team and the crowd loved it when Trace carried the 44-year-old in a papoose

Light as a feather: The duo often played up to the comical size difference between them

The 44-year-old had arrived on the red carpet in a striking cobalt blue gown, and left in shimmering gold.

In between, she went casual in both silver and gold jeans, and sported a gold mini-dress as well as two more floor-length gowns in black and white respectively.

There was another hilarious moment where Kristin emerged in a flamenco dress while pretending to be reality TV star and pageant child Honey Boo Boo.

Gold star: The talented blonde even performed at one stage during the jam-packed evening

Lighting up the stage: Two of Kristin's outfits consisted of a black sequined frock and plunging white gown

Let it snow: There was a very festive end to the evening, with Lady Antebellum performing, the hosts in costume and fake snow covering the stage

How will he get them all home?: Luke Bryan dominated the winners with a staggering seven awards

So much to celebrate: Carrie and Miranda posed with their guitar trophies after winning two awards apiece

Jumping for joy: Carrie was excited to be able to add Female Artist of the Year to her ever-growing trophy collection

Her chemistry with Trace was clear 
for all to see, and their antics amused the crowd – particularly when 
Trace came onstage with Kristin in a papoose.

The winners of the night, which took place in Las Vegas on Monday, were dominated by a delighted Luke Bryan, who scooped an incredible seven awards.

He
took home the gongs for Artist of the Year, Artist of the Year: Male, 
Album of the Year, Single of the Year, Single of the Year: Male, Music 
Video of the Year, and Music Video of the Year: Male.

Let's get going!: Miranda was the first star to present an award before later scooping two of her own

Twice as nice: There were more celebrations in store for Lady Antebellum, who scooped two gongs, as Hillary Scott has just announced her pregnancy

Teamwork: It wasn't hard to tell why the band won Artist Of The Year: Group when they showed their skills onstage

Whoops: Dustin Lynch swooped in to correct Carmen Electra when she mistakenly dubbed the show 'the ACEs'

Such gentlemen: Both Luke Bryan and Jake Owen were quick to thank the audience when they were presented with guitar trophies

But there was plenty to celebrate for other country stars.

Miranda Lambert and Carrie Underwood were awarded two trophies apiece, with Carrie beating Miranda in the Artist of the Year: Female category while Miranda was presented with Single of the Year: Female and Music Video of the Year: Female for Over You.

Meanwhile, Artist of the Year: Breakthrough Artist was won by Jake Owen while Lauren Alaina was named Artist of the Year: New Artist.
