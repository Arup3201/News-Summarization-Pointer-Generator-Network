Just when you thought you couldn't hear PSY's Gangnam Style one more time a house adorned with more than 25,000 breathtaking LED lights may make you see it in a whole new light.

Flashing in perfect timing to the four-minute song, managing to capture both dance moves and pauses for breath, the spectacle of lights outside Austin, Texas is mesmerizing a growing YouTube audience worldwide.

Lights sharply thumping across the double-door garage follow the same energetic beat performed by the Korean musician before flashes of snowflakes shimmer as well as sway in and out.

High energy spectacle: Flashing in perfect timing to PSY's hit four-minute song Gangnam Style this home outside Austin, Texas delivers a jaw dropping light display in precision and energy

The dance: Managing to capture the Korean musician's remarkable dance moves in pulsing waves of lights the display is spot on with the song's exciting rhythm

On the lawn a line of white-lit Christmas trees wave in and out before two tall trees in their middle which shoot up in colour like burning roman candles.

Using a center green-lit cactus at times as a mouth piece for its stop and go, the house comes to a dramatic stance with the song, cutting its display to a pitch black before abruptly beginning again.

Owner and designer John Storms says it's a similar display to the ones he's put together the past few years, though it's an entirely new experience for his current neighbourhood - his family having moved in just two months ago.

'He barely unpacked and first thing he started with was the lights,' a mesmerized neighbor told KXAN. 'How do you compete with that?'

New neighbours: The homeowners moved into the house just two months ago before setting up the lights, fortunately, they say, to the delight of neighbours

Price tag: With all of the more than 25,000 lights being LEDs the homeowner says December's electricity bill for the display will be a mere $15

Work of art: Homeowner and designer John Storms said it two him two weekends setting up the display and two to three hours programming the lights to Gangnam Style as well as some other holiday favourites

Fortunately for Mr Storms the lights have been received positively he says, and the music isn't heard blaring from the roadside but can instead be heard from a radio station audience members can tune into from their cars.

Having spent two weekends adorning the house - with hired help for his safety - it took him two to three hours programming the music to Gangnam Style he said, but did so too to some holiday favourites.

As for the electricity bill Mr Storms tells KXAM the LED lights will cost him just $15 to run the entire month of December.

Controls: Mr Storm shows off his small work station that controls the lights, designed using programme Audacity on his netbook, pictured

'All our lights we have are LED so they just sip on electricity,' he said.

Using his website ListentoOurLights, he shares not only his previous year's work but a quick how-to tutorial on his accomplishments as well.

Mr Storms, a perhaps recognizable fan of movie National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, calls character Clark Griswold a hero.
