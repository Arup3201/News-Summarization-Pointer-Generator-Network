Twenty British soldiers killed during the First World War were today laid to rest near the battlefield where they died nearly 100 years ago.

The bodies were discovered in 2010 near during clearance work for new buildings near Vendin-le-Vieil, north of Arras in France.

All of the men died at the Battle of Loos in 1915, and they were buried at the Dud's Corner, a cemetery run by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission located in the town of Loos-en-Gohelle.

Ceremony: Private William McAleer and 19 other soldiers were today laid to rest in France a century after they died in the Battle of Loos

Atmospheric: The ceremony at the Loos British Cemetery took place in thick fog

Duty: The soldiers wore kilts as they carried the coffin of Pte McAleer, who was born in Fife

Pallbearers: The private's coffin was carried by a group of soldiers from The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland

The only one to have been identified by name is Private William McAleer, 22, from the 7th Battalion the Royal Scottish Fusiliers, whose step-great-nephew Stephen McLeod was present at the ceremony.

Among the other soldiers who died during the fierce battle were a Northumberland Fusilier, another six Royal Scottish Fusiliers and a member of the York and Lancaster Regiment.

The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland accorded military honours to the men as they were buried, with the unidentified soldiers commemorated as 'Known unto God'.

Pte McAleer's coffin was given his own burial plot, with his headstone reading '13766, Private W. McAleer Royal Scots Fusiliers, 26th September 1915, age 22'.

The remainder were buried in six other plots side by side. 

Sombre: A large crowd turned out to pay their respects to Pte McAleer and his unidentified comrades

Laid to rest: The soldiers' bodies were found in 2010 during construction work after lying in an unmarked plot for 95 years

In thick fog, a piper led six bearers as they carried Pte McAleer's Union flag-draped coffin topped with a wreath, belt and cap past the crowds and the burial plots of hundreds of other fallen soldiers.

A military firing party fired a salute during the service and the Last Post was played.

Mr McLeod, a former Black Watch soldier from Cowdenbeath, wore a Tam o' Shanter hat and a Northern Ireland medal to the service.

He said his grandmother had talked about Pte McAleer, but added that he did not previously know how his ancestor had died.

'I knew about his existence and knew he died in the First World War, but I didn't know his body wasn't found,' the father of two said.

Moving: The burial was arranged by the Ministry of Defence and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission

Wreath: A mourner dressed in black carries dozens of poppies in tribute to the fallen soldiers

'That was news to myself when the military put out an appeal for his descendants to come forward. It was my cousin who heard the appeal, who in turn contacted my brother.

'To come to the Commonwealth and show my respect, especially as a former soldier, to those who have fallen, is a great honour.

'But to be able to come here in the centenary year and show respect to kith and kin is unique. It's unfortunate that we have the other 19 soldiers unidentified.

'It would have been nice if their descendants were able to show their respects.'

Family: Stephen McLeod, the step-great-nephew of Pte McAleer, was present to watch his ancestor buried

Contemplation: Mr McLeod, a former soldier with the Black Watch, said he had not known how Pte McAleer died

Respect: Mr McLeod was handed the personal effects of Pte McAleer during the burial ceremony

The Battle of Loos featured 
the first British use of poison gas, and followed a four-day artillery 
bombardment along a six-and-a-half-mile front.

The
 attack led by Sir Douglas Haig happened simultaneously as the French 
attacked the German lines at Champagne and at Vimy Ridge in Arras.

But
 the Germans were able to successfully hold their position on both 
fronts, helped by a second line of trenches built six miles behind the 
front lines.

On September 25 1915, Pte McAleer's battalion had reached Hill 70 to the east of Loos and dug in behind the crest line.

They fought off a German counter-attack during the night before being ordered to attack a German redoubt the following morning.

Although
 they entered the German trenches, after fierce hand-to-hand fighting 
they were forced to retreat to their start positions.

They were then subjected to heavy 
artillery bombardment which led to their withdrawal later after two 
unsuccessful bids by 21 Division to join up had failed.

Piper: A musician from the battalion plays a lament for the dead during the service

Sacred ground: The Dud's Corner graveyard in Loos-en-Gohelle, near the site of the battle

Resting place: The names of many of those buried in the cemetery are unknown, and they are marked as 'Known unto God'

Records
 of the 7th Battalion the Royal Scots Fusiliers showed that in just two 
days of battle, 69 died, 258 were wounded and 181 were missing.

Peter
 Francis, of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, told MailOnline: 
‘These casualties were discovered at a construction site of a new prison
 being built.

‘During 
work preparing the ground for that, they found what appeared to be a 
battleground grave, which also contained some 30 German casualties. From
 the location and regiments involved, initial indications were that 
these were from the Battle of Loos in September 1915.

‘The remains were recovered by the 
Commission and kept safe in our mortuary, near Arras. Then the Ministry 
of Defence got involved.

‘They
 have a unit called the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre – they 
deal with present-day military casualties but also historical cases as 
well. They began the lengthy task of looking at whether or not they can identify these individuals.’

Memorial: A card of remembrance for the private issued by his mother after his death in September 1915

Identification: Pte McAleer was identified thanks to the metal tag he was buried with

Pte McAleer - born in Leven, Fife, as
 the son of a miner - was identified thanks to a metal identification 
tag which he happened to be carrying at the time of his death.

'This
 is slightly unusual because British soldiers didn’t have metal ID tags 
during the First World War, so this was something he'd got himself,' Mr 
Francis said.

‘In 1916 
they brought in the two tags, but they were made of a compressed 
cardboard, not metal - but soldiers often brought their own metal ones.’

The Loos Memorial near where the soldiers went into action carries the names of more than 20,000 missing from the battle.

More
 than 950,000 British and Commonwealth military personnel died in the 
First World War, with a further 2.2 million armed forces members wounded
 in action.

Devastation: The attack in Loos happened simultaneously as the French attacked the German lines at Champagne and at Vimy Ridge in Arras

Of those killed, some 600,000 have a marked grave but there remain more than 300,000 British and Commonwealth personnel with no known grave.

This year, the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre will conduct more ceremonies for the remains of a further 43 British soldiers killed in the First World War across mainland Europe.

The events will be attended by serving members of the fallen's regiment, or its successor, and the regimental association, senior military officers and, where possible, relatives of the soldier.

In October, 15 soldiers from the Yorks and Lancashire Regiment who are believed to have died in battle around Beauchamp Ligny, France, will be buried.

And six soldiers, believed to have been serving with the Lancashire Fusiliers and Kings Own Regiments, are to be buried in early September at Prowse Point Cemetery in Belgium.

In addition, a soldier from the Welsh Guards and an officer from the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Regiment will be buried in separate events on dates to be decided later this year.
