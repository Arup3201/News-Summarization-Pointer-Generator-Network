New Defense Secretary Ashton Carter has said that the US may keep more troops in Afghanistan than expected.

The Pentagon head, who met with the Afghan president Ashraf Ghani on Saturday, said that the Obama administration was considering 'possible changes to the timeline for the drawdown of U.S. troops'.

He said that there could be a slowdown because the Afghan government was becoming a more reliable partner.

Former Afghan president Hamid Karazi had previously criticized the US military.

The new unity government with Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, which took office in September, could help with stability, Carter said.

His trip to Afghanistan, his first journey abroad as Defense Secretary, comes as Ghani is scheduled to visit President Obama at the White House next month.

There are currently 10,000 US soldiers in the country, though its security is the responsibility of the Afghan security forces, who number about 350,000.

At one point in 2010-2011 there were 100,000 US personnel in Afghanistan.

American and NATO forces transferred control of their bases to local forces last year and the number of troops is expected to half this year before falling to near zero by 2017.

Carter did not say that the president was thinking of elongating troops' stay in the country.

It is not known how a slowdown would affect the current plan for troop withdrawals, which has been criticized by Obama's Republican critics who say that extremists could return to the country like they did after US troops left Iraq.

General John F Campbell, the top commander in the country said that there is progress in how Afghan forces are fighting and said 'We've got a government here that wants us to be here.'

There are still remnants of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in addition to Taliban fighters, as well as fears that Islamic State militants could recruit or become powerful in the Middle Eastern country.

In January an Afghan general said that fighters loyal to ISIS were active in some southern regions, though Gen Campbell says that the situation is not like that in Iraq, where the extremists control large swaths of territory.

Carter called ISIS's presence in Afghanistan 'aspirational'.

Taliban forces remain the largest threat to the Afghan government, and dialogue with their lingering forces is expected to begin as soon as March.

Last year was the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since 2001, with 5,000 Afghan security forces and more than 3,000 civilians killed, according to the BBC.

The period since the US handed control over to the Afghanis has seen fierce fighting between the government's forces and insurgents, largely Taliban in the Helmand province.

Carter said that 'a lot has changed here, so much of it for the better' since his last visit to Afghanistan in 2013. 

Ghani has said he supports a slower withdrawal. 

Both he and Carter said they would discuss 'reality on the ground' with President Obama. 

The new defense secretary officially took over for Chuck Hagel earlier this week, and said Afghanistan was his first visit 'because this is where we still have 10,000 American troops and they come first in my mind, always'.

The appointee also stressed continued resource and equipment support for the Afghan government to establish progress.

Carter also met with US commanders in Afghanistan General Lloyd J. Austin and General Campbell, in addition to US Ambassador P Michael McKinley
