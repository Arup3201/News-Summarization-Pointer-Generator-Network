Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has stepped into the reported family feud following the death of Nelson Mandela, saying that the oldest child will head the clan – not his oldest living male relative.

The ex-wife of the human rights icon said Makaziwe Mandela, 60, the only living child from Mandela’s first marriage to Evelyn Mase, will take charge.

It has previously been reported that Nelson Mandela’s oldest male heir, grandson Mandla Mandela, would take over as head of the family.

Taking a stand: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has said that oldest living child Makaziwe will become the head of the Mandela family - not the oldest male descendant, grandson Mandla

Ms Madikizela-Mandela denied that the 
family is engaged in a ‘succession or dynasty’ battle, refuting claims 
in media of a feud.

‘In 
accordance with customary law and tradition the eldest daughter, being 
Ms. Makaziwe Mandela, will head the family and will make decisions with 
the support of her two sisters.

'To this end there is no 
misunderstanding, or debate. Mr. Mandla Mandela is respected as one of 
Nelson Mandela's grandchildren, the next generation of the Mandela 
family,’ she said.

The 
Johannesburg tabloid The Times reported earlier this week that Mandela's
 grandson Mandla had found himself locked out of the Mandela homestead 
in the Eastern Cape hamlet of Qunu where Mandela was buried on Sunday.

According
 to the report, Mandela's eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela, had ordered
 the locks changed after she arrived while Mandla was keeping vigil next
 to his grandfather's coffin as the body lay in state at the Union 
Buildings in Pretoria for three days.

Right to inherit: Makaziwe is Nelson Mandela's oldest living child, whereas Mandla is the oldest grandchild

Mandla also reportedly found his 
home on the Mandela estate without electricity and water on the day of 
his grandfather's burial.

Mandla
 Mandela declined to comment on the matter.

'He (Mandla) doesn't want to confirm 
nor deny the report. He wants to focus on promoting and upholding the 
legacy of his grandfather going forward,’his spokesman Freddy Pilusa said.

Madikizela-Mandela,
 in a statement issued on her behalf by her spokesman, Thato Mmereki, 
lashed out at what she called ‘mischievous innuendos and newsroom slugs 
designed to disgrace the family’ through ‘apartheid-style’ tactics.

She said she is disappointed with the media's ‘interference in closed matters of the Mandela family.’

‘These
 reports have done nothing but use half-truths to cast a shadow on the 
Mandela family during their time of bereavement,’ she asserted.

Madikizela-Mandela
 noted that three daughters survive Nelson Mandela: Makaziwe Mandela, 
Zenani Dlamini-Mandela and Zindziswa Mandela.
