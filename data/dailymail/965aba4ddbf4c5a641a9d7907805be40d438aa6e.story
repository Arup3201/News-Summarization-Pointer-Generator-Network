A science teacher who had an affair with a 15-year-old pupil has been jailed for 18 months.

Michael Pooley, 35, dated the teenager for four months, taking her on day trips and to a hotel, until her parents found out what was going on.

Judge Alan Goldsack QC said he hoped Pooley's sentence acted as a warning to any others in his profession 'thinking of behaving in this way'.

He who told him: 'Parents are entitled to expect when their children leave home to go to school that they are going to be safe and teachers will protect rather than abuse them.'

In court: Michael Pooley was sentenced to 18 months in prison at Sheffield Crown Court after having a relationship with a 15-year-old pupil

Judge Goldsack heard how a mutual relationship developed between Pooley and a girl, who is now 17-years-old and cannot be named, at a secondary school in West Yorkshire.

He was told how this started with the girl having a crush on the teacher and they began to see each other out of school, eventually going on trips together and staying in a hotel.

Prosecutor Laura Marshall said: 'It was very much a mutual relationship. The two had talked about children and marriage, but this was put off by Pooley after he said her parents wouldn’t be happy about the idea.'

Sheffield Crown Court heard how the pair communicated using Facebook over a four-month period and Pooley even set up two fake accounts on the social media site so the girl’s parents would not spot he was talking to their daughter.

Judge Goldsack told Pooley: 'You agreed to meet her in the long school holidays and had regular Facebook contact with her.

'You then created two fake accounts to deliberately deceive her parents, should they look at her computer.

'Twice you took the girl without the consent of her parents on day trips. Undoubtedly, she had a strong attachment to you.'

The court heard Pooley was confronted after friends of the girl alerted their parents to the relationship.

The court heard that despite the defendant admitting touching the girl sexually, there was no penetrative sex between them and Pooley had continually dismissed the teenager’s requests for him to 'take her virginity'.

Pooley, who was a teacher at a school in Wakefield, told the girl he wanted to wait until she was 16-years-old, the judge was told.

Sheffield Crown Court heard that the girl in question now has medical issues and will have to take medication for the rest of her life due to stress.

Pooley, of Miles Hill Terrace, Potternewton, Leeds - who stood in the dock wearing a dark suit, grey shirt and a grey striped tie - admitted seven counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of child abduction at a previous hearing.

He was jailed for 18 months, ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register and was banned from working with children indefinitely.
