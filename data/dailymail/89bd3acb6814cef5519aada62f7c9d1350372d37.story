Could the brutal murders attributed to Jack the Ripper have been committed by a woman charity worker in a perverse bid to bring the harrowing conditions in the East End into the light?

This is the theory put forward in a new novel about the Victorian serial killer, whose elusive identity has occupied criminologists for more than a century.

During the 1888 murder spree in east London's Whitechapel, the Ripper killed women and removed their sexual and internal organs with such surgical precision that many believed he had to be a doctor.

Now author William J Perring has raised the possibility in The Seduction Of Mary Kelly, his novel about the life and times of the final victim, that it was perhaps not 'Jack' the Ripper, but 'Julia' - a Salvation Army soldier.

Mr Perring, 63, who was born in east London, has been fascinated by the murders for nearly three decades and is sceptical about some of the suspects put forward by 'ripperologists' over the past century.

He said: 'The majority of "factual" books have unlikely suspects, and I don't think in the history of serial killers there has ever been one who was famous beforehand.

'The most likely thing is it was somebody we've never heard of and certainly a woman would be ideal for this.

'My theory is more likely than many of the others. This is not just a novel but a possible solution to the Ripper mystery.'

The book outlines an intriguing and unexpected motive for the female Salvation Army volunteer behind the savage killings - helping the desperate residents of Whitechapel.

Mr Perring says the murders had an unexpected outcome - they drew the attention of the wider world to the appalling conditions endured by those living in the capital's slums.

'The Ripper murders surprisingly did a lot of good for the East End,' he said.

'Someone had shone a light on how awful the conditions were. There were all manner of social works and good deeds afterwards.'

Jack the Ripper murdered five victims in 1888.

Mary Ann Nichols was disembowled on Buck's Row.

Annie Chapman's uterus was removed at 29 Hanbury St.

Elizabeth Stride's throat was cut at Duffield's Yard, Berner St.

Catherine Eddowes's uterus and kidney were removed and her cheeks torn on Mitre Square.

Mary Jane Kelly was completely mutilated and her heart was removed at 13 Miller's Court.

The
 book follows the life of Mary Jane Kelly, who was approximately 25 at 
the time of her death.

She had blonde hair, blue eyes, a fair complexion
 and was said to be very beautiful.

Originally 
from Cardiff, she arrived in London in 1884 and was believed to have 
worked in a high class brothel in the West End, but through misfortune, 
perhaps related to drink, she found herself in the East End.

She was discovered dead in a home in Miller's Court on November 9, 1888, mutilated beyond recognition.

No family member could be found to attend the funeral.

The
 notion that Jack the Ripper might not in fact be a man at all was first posited
 by Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline, a key figure in the 
investigation at the time.

According
 to Donald McCormick, author of the 1959 book The Identity of Jack the 
Ripper, the officer raised the theory in a conversation with his mentor, 
Dr Thomas Dutton after the murder of Mary Kelly.

He
 theorised the fact a female culprit made sense as they could stalk the 
streets of Whitechapel with ease because the whole of London was looking
 for a man.

Mary Jane Kelly claims to have been born in Ireland – yet no record of her exists there.

Her childhood was spent in Wales, where she married a miner – and yet by her early twenties, and without any known explanation, she was in London.

She lived in Knightsbridge and lived a life of luxury, buying expensive dresses, riding in carriages, and visiting Paris on at least one occasion.

But even more intriguing is how, from such lofty heights, she fell so low as to be living in a single room in Whitechapel, in a squalid little court off Dorset Street, then known as the worst street in London.

Numerous individuals have been accused of being the serial killer.

At the time, police suspected the Ripper must have been a butcher, due to the way his victims were killed and the fact they were discovered near to the dockyards, where meat was brought into the city.

There are several alleged links between the killer and royals. First is Sir William Gull, the royal physician. Many have accused him of helping get rid of the prostitutes' bodies, while others claim he was the Ripper himself.

Another book named Queen Victoria's surgeon Sir John Williams as the infamous killer. He had a surgery in Whitechapel at the time.

Another theory links the murders with Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Victor,  the Duke of Clarence.

At one point, cotton merchant James Maybrick was the number one suspect, following the publication of some of his diary which appeared to suggest he was the killer. However some believe the diary to be a forgery although no one has been able to suggest who forged it.

Other suspects include Montague John Druitt, a Dorset-born barrister. He committed suicide in the Thames seven weeks after the last murder.

George Chapman, otherwise known as Severyn Kłosowski, poisoned three of his wives and was hanged in 1903.

Another suspected by polive was Aaron Kosminski. He was admitted to Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum and died there.

Dr Thomas Neill Cream, poisoned four London prostitutes with strychnine and was hanged.

Some of the more bizarre links include Lewis Carroll, author of the Alice in Wonderland books, who taught at Christ Church until 1881 - which was at the forefront of the Ripper murder scenery.

Winston Churchill's father - Lord Randolph Churchill - has also been named as a potential suspect.

Crime writer Patricia Cornwell  believes she has 'cracked' the case by unearthing evidence that confirms Walter Sickert, an influential artist, as the prime suspect. Her theories have not been generally accepted.
