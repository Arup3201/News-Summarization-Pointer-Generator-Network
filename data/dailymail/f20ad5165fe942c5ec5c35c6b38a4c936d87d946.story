It’s a classic Easter meal loved by families around the world: a juicy lamb joint served with rosemary, roast potatoes, carrots and sprouts.

But one London restaurant is giving the traditional roast a twist this spring, serving the entire spread deep-fried.

In fact, everything on this menu is doused in batter and then fried, from buttered crumpets and cheese strings to Tunnock’s tea cakes, hot cross buns and even a whole pizza.

London's latest pop-up #FryHard plans to offer more than 100 deep-fried items over the long Easter weekend

London’s latest pop-up restaurant #FryHard in Boxpark, Shoreditch will be serving more than 100 different deep-fried foods during the long Easter weekend (2 to 5 April). 

The calorific eaterie is the brainchild of Messhead, a collaboration between chef Jim Thomlinson’s London Mess and freelance creative director Emma Thomas, better known as Miss Cakehead.

Miss Cakehead told FEMAIL: We will be serving deep fried quiche Lorraine, pasties, pork pies, Scotch egg, frankfurters and burgers.'

The pair will also offer fried desserts alongside their savoury items, with doughnuts, cakes and even coconut ices all getting the deep-fried treatment.

‘We are handmaking most things, ‘ she continued, ‘and people are going to bring along stuff for us to fry and we don’t know what people will bring.

‘It has got to be edible and the final decision [whether they should be deep-fried] comes from Jim. ‘

The fully fried Easter feast will serve six people and has to be booked in advance.

As well as sweets #FryHard will also offer savoury items such as deep-fried pork pies (left) and pizza (right) 

‘We had this idea at Christmas as Die Hard is my favourite Christmas movie,’ Miss Cakehead continued.

‘Messhead loves a good pun - it's great to see other Die Hard fans get the 'Now I Have A Deep Fat Fryer' reference in the images by Travis Hodges.’

She did however admit that the idea is a trifle silly.

She said: ‘Jim is about to launch his street food concept Prawnography at Old Street Roudabout - part of Burger Bear HQ - so we want to do something really fun and ridiculous before the hard work begins.

‘We also tried deep fried chocolate at Jim's previous pop up The Dead Horse Society - once I tasted it for the first time I knew I had to revisit!'

But while the venture has been greeted with interest the pair have no plans to make it into a more permanent thing.

'It is just for Easter - after which Jim will continue with Prawnogrpahy and I will continue on goodness knows what alongside,’ Miss Cakehead continued.

‘The response has been amazing though one dentist on Twitter said we were "disgusting".

‘So many people want to come and try the foods on offer with deep fried Babybel getting the strongest response so far.'
