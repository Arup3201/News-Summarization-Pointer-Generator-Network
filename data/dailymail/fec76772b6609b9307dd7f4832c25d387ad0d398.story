Prince Edward, the Countess of Wessex and their children enjoyed a Royal family day out in the sunshine as they rode horses around the Queen's Windsor home.

The prince's 10-year-old daughter Lady Louise looked every inch the confident horsewoman as she went without a saddle to ride bareback around the grounds of Windsor Castle.

Her younger brother James, six, was led around by a stablehand as Edward, sporting pair of brown riding boots, walked alongside another horse and proud mother Sophie watched on.

The family, who celebrated Prince Edward's 50th birthday last week, appeared happy and relaxed as they made the most of the warm weather.

Prince Edward carried on with a public engagement after her fall, but her mother pulled out on an event in Manchester to be by her daughter's side.

Earlier this year it was revealed that Louise, a bridesmaid at Prince William's wedding, had undergone surgery to correct a severe squint caused by exotropia which she had suffered from since birth.

The photographs of the little girl on her morning hack appeared to suggest that the operation had been a success.
