It was a a blow but the record had to go sometime.

More than 500 Alpine horn players today broke the world mark for the largest number of people playing the instrument.

Clad in traditional Swiss costume, they gathered in the Swiss region of Zermatt, home to the Matterhorn mountain to perform a piece specially composed for their wooden horns.

Open air concert: A total of 508 alphorn players break the world record for the largest ensemble of people playing the instrument, on the Gornergrat in front of the Matterhorn mountain near Zermatt

Horn section: Men and women blow their instruments during the concert 10,000ft up a mountain near Zermatt

Big noise: A giant alphorn is paraded at the Gornergrat Mountain, as the players get ready to perform in the concert

Blow us down: Two men get to grips with the alphorn as they prepare to help break the world record

Instruments: A selection of alphorns are placed on the ground after the concert which saw a four-year record broken

The 508 players took a record set in 2009 when 366 musicians played a concert.

They performed on the Gornergrat ridge, more than 3,000 metres (10,000ft) above sea level.

The instrument, known as an alphorn and traditionally used for herding animals, can be up to four metres long.

It has to be propped up on the ground and its player usually has to stand up to sound it because of its size.

Noisy group: The alphorn players blow hard on the Gornergrat in front of the Matterhorn mountain near Zermatt

Start: A flag drops to indicate the beginning of the concert in front of the Matterhorn mountain. The record was held by 366 musicians in 2009

Hard work: One of the alphorn players rests his instrument on a shoulder before the concert begins

Playing along: reading from music the players blow their instruments in the shadow of the Matterhorn mountain

Ready when you are: Conductor Gilbert Kolly leads 508 alphorn blowers playing together and establishing a new world record for largest group performance
