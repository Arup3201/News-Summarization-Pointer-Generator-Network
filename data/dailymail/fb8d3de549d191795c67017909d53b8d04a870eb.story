A 97-year-old man has been found dead in deep snow outside his Massachusetts home a day after the blizzard, police say. 

Richard MacLean Sr's body was spotted next to a carbon dioxide exhaust vent on the side of his Yarmouth home on Wednesday evening. 

MacLean's son had called police from Arizona to ask them to check on him.

Police say it appears MacLean died while trying to clear the vent, and there were no signs of a crime. His death remains under investigation.

Two feet of snow descended on Yarmouth in the blizzard.

MacLean's son first called police Wednesday afternoon, but an officer was told the elder MacLean was staying with a neighbor. 

After contacting the neighbor and learning his father wasn't there, he called again.
