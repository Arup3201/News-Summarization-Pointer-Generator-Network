A disgruntled investor from Atlanta spent nearly three decades trying to get law enforcement to help him get possession of his stolen car.

And considering the car in question is a specific model of 1962 Ferrari of which there were only four made ever, it makes sense why he has not given up on the case.

Because of some detective work and the collection of verified owner's certificates, it looks like said stolen car may now be in the possession of billionaire Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee. Because of its rarity, the car is valued at around $15million.

Rare: This is one of the four 1962 Ferrari 330 LM-B. The one shown here was at a Connecticut car show this year

The tale of Ivars Blumenau and his stolen red Ferrari 330 LeMans-Berlinetta is part Grand Theft Auto and part wild goose chase as it reportedly involves multiple resales, museum displays in broad daylight, and questionable car dealers.

Every wrinkle in the multi-faceted case was laid out by Jalopnik, who had an lengthy interview with Mr Blumenau.

Current owner: Billionaire Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee is thought to have bought the stolen car in the 1990s

He sent the site documentation proving that he did, in fact own the car which was one of only four made. What also makes this particular style special is that it was the last front-engined racing Ferrari, making its theft even more stinging.

The story began when Mr Blumenau bought a 330 LMBs from a mechanic and dealer in Atlanta named Donlad Fong, a Ferrari specialist who was well-known within the car collecting community.

Mr Blumenau stored the car with Fong, and it was stolen from Fong's facility in 1977. Police documentation proves its theft, though it incorrectly lists Fong as the owner.

Using a third party, the car was resold to a man in Chicago before leaving the country and finding homes in German and the Netherlands among other places.

In those homes were wealthy car enthusiasts, one of whom apparently bought the car at auction for $4.7million in 1989.

The highest profile appearance of the car came when it was displayed at the Blackhawk Museum in Danville, California.

According to Jalopnik, Lee Kun-hee, the billionaire chairman of Samsung bought the car in the mid-1990s.

While Mr Kun-hee is based in South Korea- where he is one of the most powerful people in the country- he is thought to have initially left the car in America to avoid high import taxes, though there is speculation that the car eventually made its way over the Ocean and out of American legal jurisdiction.

The case is currently ongoing and has open files in the local Atlanta police files, in the FBI and in Interpol.

Proof: This is the record which shows the car was stolen while under the possession of dealer Donald Fong
