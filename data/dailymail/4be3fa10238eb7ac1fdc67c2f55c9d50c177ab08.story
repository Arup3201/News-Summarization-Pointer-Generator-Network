A New York man has been sentenced to spend up to seven years in prison for faking his own drowning in an insurance fraud scheme and other crimes.

Raymond Roth of Massapequa, Long Island, was sentenced to between two years and seven years in prison in Nassau County Court.

He admitted to faking his own drowning at Jones Beach in the summer of 2012.

He was later convicted on unrelated charges of posing as a police officer and trying to accost a woman on a Freeport street. Thursday's sentencing covers both crimes.

Roth's son, Jonathan Roth, is serving a year in the county jail for helping his father with the drowning scheme

Roth's son, Jonathan Roth, is serving a year in the county jail for helping his father with the drowning scheme.

Roth also must pay $36,555.37 in restitution to cover the costs emergency workers incurred in searching for him in the drowning scam.

Police marine units, helicopters and officers searched for Raymond Roth for days with no results. A relative later reported he was in Florida.

The sentencing comes a month after he was found Roth not guilty of attempted kidnapping and attempted coercion.

Defense attorney Brian Davis had argued that Roth thought the woman he confronted was a prostitute but conceded that Roth was guilty of claiming to be a police officer when he tried to force her into his van.

He described Roth's actions as "a lot of big-mouth bravado from somebody who really wasn't in control of all his faculties."

Davis said Roth has a variety of problems.

'It's part mental issues and also part substance abuse,' he said.

'He cannot drink alcohol. He cannot take illicit substances. And if he's going to drink, he's going to continue to get into trouble.'

Roth had been looking at a 90-day jail sentence in the insurance fraud case, but that deal was negated following his arrest on the other charges.

Roth also pleaded guilty to violating an order of protection obtained by his estranged wife.

She notified authorities that Roth may have faked his drowning after discovering emails written between Roth and his son plotting the ruse.
