Millionaire: Hossein Mehjoo made his fortune in the UK after coming here as a child refugee from Iran - then tried to avoid paying £850,000 tax

A refugee given asylum in Britain became a millionaire entrepreneur – but repaid the country that helped him by trying to avoid £850,000 in tax.

Hossein Mehjoo fled his native Iran at the age of 12 and won  asylum in 1982 after his MP and a local newspaper campaigned for him to stay.

He claimed at the time he would get ‘a bullet in the head’ in Iran.

‘I am terrified of going back. I will fight this all the way,’ he said. ‘They will have to handcuff me and drag me to the aircraft.’

He became a British citizen and built a successful fashion business that paid for a yacht and a home in Worcestershire with two tennis courts.

In April 2005, he sold his firm, Bank Fashion Limited, for £8.5million. But he was determined to avoid paying a 10 per cent tax on capital gains, equal to around £850,000.

He might have deemed it a small price to pay for his new life. Instead, the 54-year-old has waged a long legal battle against accountants Harben Barker – for failing to get him out of the tax bill.

He tried to throw the blame on to Alan Purnell, a close friend who started working as his accountant as his fashion business grew. Mr Purnell, 68, worked for Harben Barker until his recent retirement.

The High Court initially ruled in favour of Mehjoo, awarding him more than £1million in June last year. Judge Silber said Mr Purnell was ‘honest, decent and competent’, but should have advised Mehjoo to take specialist tax advice because he is not domiciled in Britain. This means different rules apply to his assets.

The judge’s ruling caused controversy because it seemed to say that accountants have  a duty to help their wealthy  clients avoid tax. But this week the Court of Appeal overturned the ruling – and left Mehjoo with a multi-million pound bill.

One accountant, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘It was pure greed. He only had to pay capital gains tax at 10 per cent. Britain saved his life, and that is the way that he thanks this country and his mate.’

The friendship between Mr Purnell and Mehjoo began in 1981 when the pair started playing squash regularly. Mehjoo, who went to a boarding school in West Yorkshire, played squash professionally until injuring his back in 1998.

Yesterday HM Revenue and Customs said: ‘This case shows the fall-out when tax avoidance schemes don’t live up to their promises.

‘Most schemes simply don’t work . . . You can be left with considerable costs, including fees, penalties and interest. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.’

Father-of-two Mehjoo was born in Tehran in 1959 and is a non-domicile, meaning that his official main residence is not in Britain.

When he sold his firm in 2005, he paid £200,000 to enter an aggressive tax avoidance scheme recommended by an outside accountancy firm – not by respected Harben Barker.

However, when this failed and he had to pay the tax and large amounts of interest, he sued Harben Barker because, he said, they should have told him there were better schemes available to him.

As a non-domicile, he could have avoided paying capital gains tax at all in a ‘Bearer Warrant Planning’ scheme.

He will now have to repay the money he won from Harben Barker as well as millions of pounds in legal fees.

Britain loses some £35billion a year as a result of cheats and tax avoiders, HMRC said.

David Minett, of Harben Barker, said it is ‘delighted that justice has prevailed’ after a three-year legal battle.
