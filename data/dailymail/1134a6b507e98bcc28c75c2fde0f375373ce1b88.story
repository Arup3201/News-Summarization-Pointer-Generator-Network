A beautiful Scottish glen which featured in the James Bond film Skyfall is being blighted by fly-tippers and litter louts.

Tents, mattresses, and pile upon pile of rubbish is left strewn around Glen Etive, in Lochaber, in the Scottish Highlands.

Residents are cataloguing the problem with a series of pictures showing the mess left by climbers and campers along the 14-mile glen to the head of Loch Etive.

It featured in the 2012 Bond blockbuster Skyfall, starring Daniel Craig and Dame Judi Dench, and also in two Harry Potter films, The Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Order of the Phoenix.

The glen also attracts huge numbers of 'wild' campers each year, who leave behind full campsites, prompting the launch of a Facebook campaign.

Mark and Phillipa Shone who have lived in the glen for the past two years, set up a Facebook community page called 'Glen Etive - The Dirty Truth' to document the behaviour of some campers and day-trippers who drive away leaving bags full of rubbish, tents, camping equipment, broken bottles, drinks cans and - in some instances - drugs paraphernalia.

Mr Shone, 29, said: 'It's just baffling the mentality of these people, who show no respect for such a gorgeous part of the country.

Mark and Phillipa Shone who have lived in the glen for the past two years, set up a Facebook community page called 'Glen Etive - The Dirty Truth' to document and expose the selfish behaviour of some campers and day-trippers

'It's the festival mentality that some people seem to have, rocking up on a Friday and partying all weekend. We see whole campsites left - tents full of dirty nappies. There's broken bottles and even supermarket trolleys which appear to be used for cooking food on the fire.'

The Shones set up the Facebook page just two weeks ago and have been amazed at the positive response, with 1,347 likes so far.

'The Facebook page has sparked a good debate and discussion about what the possible solutions might be. There have been just one or two negative comments but that is probably from people just looking for an argument," Mark said. "We don't want people to stop coming here, we just want people to respect the place and not trash it, because it is just sickening what is happening.

'There are signs in the glen telling people to take their litter home yet I find black bags full of rubbish piled up under them. There is no logic to it!'

He added: 'Maybe we need to take a 
leaf out of the United States' book and have dedicated countryside 
police or wardens who patrol our glens and could tackle the problem head
 on. I do challenge people but sometimes you have to step back if it's 
10 against one.

'It seems 
that people just don't care. It can be all sorts of people too - I've 
seen people draw up in Range Rovers, and I think they surely won't leave
 rubbish, but they do. There's no way of telling who are going to be the
 messy ones.'

Mr Shone said the constant mess means he is now considering moving away from the area.

Local Highland councillor Andrew Baxter has called for a meeting between the various landowners, public bodies and police in a bid to tackle the on-going problem of fly-tipping in Glen Etive.

He said: 'I am angered that such a beautiful glen might as well be renamed 'Glen Midden' because of the lazy and selfish actions of those who think it acceptable to simply drive away, leaving their mess behind.

'This isn't real wild camping. What is wild about leaving your car blocking a passing place, emptying the entire contents of its boot and carrying it less than a hundred metres from the road side? The only thing that is wild about this camping, is how it leaves me and many others feeling when we see how the glen is being destroyed. There's no doubt, it has got even worse since the ban on camping around Loch Lomond was introduced.

'Practical action is needed, that's why I have asked for an urgent meeting with the various landowners, public bodies and police. That meeting should take place in the very near future.

'I've been in touch with councillors in Perth and Kinross, who have experienced similar problems around Loch Rannoch. They solved the problem with a proactive approach, which included police patrols, the recording of number plates and the direct threat of prosecution. We also need to consider what would happen if camping was banned within a set distance from the road.'

The northern half of Glen Etive is tidied up regularly by landowners, the National Trust for Scotland (NTS).

A Trust spokesperson said: 'This is undoubtedly an issue for us. We share concerns about the mess left behind by irresponsible campers in Glen Etive. The Trust takes responsibility for tidying up our land - every year we remove hundreds of bags of rubbish. This work, while clearly vital, diverts staff from important conservation work in the area. It also leaves our charity with the costs for disposing of this rubbish.'

She added: 'Over the years, we have tried various approaches to tackle the issue and to try to encourage responsible behaviour and, of course, we talk regularly to our neighbours and relevant agencies about how best to tackle this. However, there are no straightforward solutions.'
