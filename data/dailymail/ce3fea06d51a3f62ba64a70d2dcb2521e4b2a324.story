The Travel Channel has pulled new-show Man Finds Foods just one day before it was set to air, following host Adam Richman's hateful online fight.

The former Man V Food host was caught calling one critic a 'c***' and telling another to 'eat a bag of s***', after they condemned his use of the controversial term 'thinspiration' in an Instagram post.

Thinspiration is a term used to describe online posts which encourage eating disorders, and have been banned on sites like Facebook and Yahoo.

Richman seemed unaware of the term's significance when he included it in the caption of a photo showing his dramatic weight loss earlier last month.

So when Instagram users started criticizing him, Richman got defensive and shot back with profanity - in one case going so far as to tell one user to commit suicide.

Though Richman has since apologized for the comments, it wasn't enough to keep his show. Travel Channel announced today that Man Finds Food has been postponed. It was slated to debut tomorrow, July 2.

Richman became famous for hosting show Man V Food (also on Travel Channel), a show where he traveled the U.S. to compete in food eating competitions. Since the show ended, Richman began a healthier lifestyle and has since experienced a dramatic weight loss.

Proud of his new body, Richman posted a photo earlier last month in which he's seen wearing an old pair of suit pants that are now much too big.

'Had ordered this suit from a Saville Row tailor over a year ago. Think I’m gonna need to take it in a little…. #Victory #EyesOnThePrize #AnythingIsPossible #fitness #transformation #thinspiration,' Richman wrote.

When one user called him out for using the negative term, he shot back with a comment reading 'DILLIGAF' - which stands for 'Do I look like I give a f***?'

Richman sent that comment to a friend of Amber Sarah, a 27-year-old fat activist who sought to put the foodie in his place.

In a post on her blog Adipose Activist, Sarah described how Richman first ignored her comment on his page.

She then wrote a post on her personal Instagram, asking others to 'tell him that eating disorders are not a joke and nothing to take lightly'.

That's when Richman got even more angry, calling Ms Sarah a 'c***' in a message that subsequently got deleted off his page.

But that didn't stop him from using the hateful word again in yet another post on Ms Sarah's personal Instagram.

When she told him he needed to apologize, Richman wrote back saying to 'give me a f****** break.'

'If anyone acts like a c*** I'll call them one. It's not misogyny, it's calling a spade a spade. Maybe you're the one being aggressive & unfair - and yes, if my use of the hashtag offended you, it was unintentional & for that I'm sorry.'

When two of Ms Sarah's friends wrote to Richman, he responded similarly.

'Seriously - grab a razor blade & draw a bath. I doubt anyone will miss you,' Richman wrote to Instagram user @_bechen

To user @thefattestfox Richman said: 'oh eat a bag of s***, dummy. No apology is coming.'

Richman did end up apologizing though, when he tweeted a statement saying: 'Yes. I've responded to internet hate recently with vile words directed at those hating me. I am sorry. I should know better & will do better.'

Ms Sarah says she has no problem with Richman's weight loss, just his use of a damaging word that has an even greater effect since he is a celebrity with more than 92,000 followers on Instagram.

'As a public figure, even if you have a personal Instagram (Adam has 94,000 followers) you need to understand that the things you say will be scrutinized, and the words you use have meaning,' Ms Sarah wrote.

'You need to be extra careful to think about not what you mean when you say things, but how other people will interpret them. And in a society where eating disorders are at an all-time high, thinspiration is a loaded word.'

For now, Travel Channel is replaced Man Finds Food with a show about grilling.
