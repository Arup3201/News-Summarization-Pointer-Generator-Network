Piers Morgan has tweeted pictures of the cracked ribs he received after being pounded by stinging 90mph deliveries from Australian fast bowler Brett Lee.

The CNN talkshow host ended up in a crumpled heap in front of 2,000 jeering Australian fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after being hit by four balls at the hands of Lee, one of the fastest bowlers the game has ever seen.

The stunt has been blasted as 'dangerous and unnecessary' by lauded former New Zealand cricketer Sir Richard Hadlee.

Piers Morgan had tried to square up against Australian Brett Lee - one of cricket's fastest bowlers

'As a former fast bowler I was appalled and outraged at what I witnessed when former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee faced off British media host Piers Morgan in the nets,' wrote Hadlee, regarded as one of the greatest fast bowlers ever, for Fairfax New Zealand News.

'I only hope that Brett takes a few minutes to reflect on his stupidity - this was a brain explosion of the highest order - it was a deliberate attempt to hit, injure, hurt and maim his opponent that I viewed as a form of grievous bodily harm or a human assault that could have proved fatal.

'I have always admired Lee as a person and as a quality fast bowler but his bowling exhibition damaged his reputation and credibility - in fact I believe he has brought the game of cricket into disrepute.'

Morgan responded on Twitter: 'Strongly disagree with Sir Richard Hadlee... I most certainly CAN bat!'

The 48-year-old former tabloid editor was in town for the fourth Test match of the Ashes - which has seen England lose the first three of the five-game series to Australia.

An outspoken critic of his homeland's efforts, Morgan hoped to restore some pride by surviving six balls in the nets from Aussie legend Lee during the tea break on the second day of the match.

Speaking after the innings, Morgan cheekily described Lee as 'a bit quicker than I thought he'd be for his age'.

Addressing his sons, who had watched the action, Morgan added: 'Boys, you still have a father. I don't know if that makes you happy or not, but I'm alive.

To my CNN president. I am alive and I'll be back in January. I'm not quitting this tour and I'm available for selection.'
