Manchester United target Mats Hummels has revealed that he wouldn't leave Borussia Dortmund just because of a club's reputation.

The 25-year-old defender was linked with a move to Old Trafford throughout the summer, but it would seem Hummels is more than happy to stay in Germany.

He told Kicker: 'If a club with a bigger reputation than Dortmund were to make a move, but I don't like the way they play football, I wouldn't even consider a move.

'At Dortmund, the style of play is exactly like I want to play football.'

The news will come as a blow to United boss Louis van Gaal, who looks to be in the market for a top class defender after a difficult start to the Premier League campaign.

Hummels has been at Dortmund since 2008, winning the Bundesliga twice as well as helping Jurgen Klopp's side reach the Champions League final in 2013, but the club have made a slow start to the new season and currently lie in 13th.

Hummels added: 'You always go through phases like this, so we shouldn't be driving ourselves crazy over it.'

Hummels was a summer target for Manchester United but is contracted at Dortmund until 2017
