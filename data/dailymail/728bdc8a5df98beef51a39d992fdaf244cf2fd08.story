It is one of the oddest creatures ever found.

Scientists today revealed an entirely new species of flatworm.

The unique animal has 60 eyes, all crammed into a body just 12mm long.

The UK's first 60 eyed flatworm has been discovered on a nature reserve in Cambridge. Scientists believed it could be an entirely new species

The creature was found in grassland near Cambridge despite the area being described as the most 'documented place on the planet'.

The 12mm worm was found by Brian Eversham, chief executive of the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire.

The peculiar invertebrate is thought to be of antipodean descent, but also a close relative of a species found in Northern Ireland called Kontikia Andersoni.

Biologist Dr Hugh Jones, an expert in the field, believed it was a 'completely new, undescribed species'.

Dr Jones, a scientific associate of the Natural History Museum, said he had only seen one other example of a similar worm, a single specimen discovered in the Netherlands in April.

Mr Eversham added: 'I was taking wildlife pictures one Sunday morning and turned over a log to reveal this rather cute flatworm.

'It is likely to be a close relative of a species found in Northern Ireland called Kontikia andersoni.

'Britain is one of the best countries for documenting wildlife so it’s quite unusual to find a species here which has not been seen before.

'New Zealand seems to be the centre of diversity for land flatworms worldwide, and its climate is very similar to Britain.

'Whereas there are millions of undescribed species in the tropics and other poorly-known parts of the world, Britain is the best-documented place on the planet.

'It’s quite unusual to find a species here which has not been seen before.'
