A man with no arms or legs has launched a recycling centre for false limbs.

Ray Edwards MBE, 59, is turning thousands of fake body parts into cash to help pay for new equipment for amputees.

The new recycling centre is set to make about £20 for each limb - by stripping away the plastic and selling the metal inside.

A quadruple amputee has set up a recycling centre for old and unwanted false limbs - and has been given more than 1,000 so far

Ray Edwards MBE, 59, had to have all of his limbs amputated when he developed septicaemia in 1987. He is pictured with his wife, Fiona, and daughters Taya (back) and Nicola (left)

It has been opened by charity Limbcare, headed by quadruple amputee Mr Edwards, who lost his arms and legs in 1987 after developing septicaemia.

The team has set up its recycling station in a warehouse in Camberley, Surrey - and has already been given over 1,000 false limbs from around the country.

They have received their limbs from amputees who needed new ones, or from relatives of users who have passed away.

Because false limbs are classed as medical waste, by law they cannot be re-used, so Mr Edwards' team are stripping away the plastic and resin outer coating, to get to the metal inside.

Mr Edwards says some of the limbs come from people who have outgrown them while others are donated by the relatives of people who have died

His recycling centre strips away the plastic on the limbs and then sells the metal on the inside - each limb can raise about £20 for Mr Edwards' charity, Limbcare

The charity will use all of the money raised by the recycling centre to help other amputees pay for new limbs, wheelchairs and rehabilitation

Mr Edwards, of Sandhurst, Berkshire, 
said: ‘The metal inside false limbs is very expensive - it’s all 
titanium, aluminium or medical-grade stainless steel.

‘In
 the past, when an amputee dies or out-grows their current false limb, 
they were just thrown away. But we can get about £20 for the metalwork 
inside, so that’s a great start.

‘There are upwards of 100,000 amputees in Britain, and each one will go through several different limbs in their lifetime.

‘I think it’s a brilliant way for us to raise money, because all the proceeds will go back to help others.

Mr Edwards said: 'We're the first people in Britain to realise the very real cost of waste artificial limbs'

Mr Edwards (centre) and his team have already been given more than 1,000 unwanted false limbs to recycle

‘We hope to raise as much money as 
possible to buy new limbs, wheelchairs and pay for rehabilitation, and 
we think we’ve come up with a fantastic way to do that.’

Below the knee prosthetics cost about £4,000, and above the knee limbs cost up to £9,000.

Mr Edwards said: ‘In the past, family members either threw away the false limbs or buried them with their loved ones.

‘Now they have an option to help others after their own loved ones have passed away.’

Limbcare is run by Mr Edwards, and double amputees Barry Perrin and Roy Wright, who both lost their legs.

As unwanted false limbs are classed as medical waste they cannot be reused

Mr Edwards said: 'The metal inside false limbs is very expensive - it's all titanium, aluminium or medical-grade stainless steel. In the past, when an amputee dies or out-grows their current false limb, they were just thrown away. But we can get about £20 for the metalwork inside, so that's a great start'

Mr Edwards said: ‘We’re the first people in Britain to realise the very real cost of waste artificial limbs.

‘Hopefully, we’ll be able to use the money we generate to buy wheelchairs, new limbs, and also to pay for the training and rehabilitation for people who need our help.

‘Lots of people know about the fantastic work Help for Heroes does, but there are lots of people out there who lost their arms and legs in other ways, and they need help too.’
