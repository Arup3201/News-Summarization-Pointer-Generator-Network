A city centre busker has gone from a homeless scruff to city dandy after being spotted playing on the street.

Now Steve Rimmer hopes his new dapper look will have the ladies queuing up to bag themselves a date.

The accordion-player was quite literally 'down at heel' and was wearing just one shoe when he was spotted by radio producer Christina Percival  on Deansgate in Manchester, who invited him to come on as a guest on Key 103's The Wrong Show with DJ Tim Shaw.

Appearing as 'Squatter Stevo' he fast became a hit with listeners, and the team arranged for him to have a top-to-toe makeover.

Gone are his grey whiskers and his unruly mop of hair has been chopped and highlighted into a new sleek blonde style.

Beauty experts also shaped his eyebrows, gave him a manicure and pedicure, a facial and new dentures.

His previous 'wardrobe' of baggy jeans and one shoe have been replaced by a smart designer suit and snazzy brogues. 

And he's been getting life and career coaching tips from celebrity lifestyle gurus Nik and Eva Speakman.

Mr Rimmer, 45, has been living rough for years after he quit a job in IT to pursue his love for music.

But for the past four years he's been busking around Manchester - sleeping rough wherever he could.

New look: The former IT worker, nicknamed 'Squatter Stevo', (pictured with Key 103 radio producer Christina Percival and DJ Tim Shaw) now hopes his new look will bag him a date

He said: 'I was a computer programmer back in the 80s, but I just couldn't handle writing spreadsheets that I knew were putting people out of work, so I quit to do something I enjoy doing which is music.

'I know I'm never going to be rich, but I've always felt that as long as I had enough money to eat then I could survive.'

DJ Mr Shaw said: 'We want to help take Steve from a life of grime to a life of riches.  This could be the most radical makeover ever.

'We'd now love to find a girlfriend for Steve, so if anyone's interested they should get in touch with the show.'

As for Mr Rimmer's verdict on his transformation? He said: 'It felt a bit strange to start off with, because I've never really had much fashion sense. 

'But it's been a completely different experience for me, the guys have all worked really hard helping me out.'
