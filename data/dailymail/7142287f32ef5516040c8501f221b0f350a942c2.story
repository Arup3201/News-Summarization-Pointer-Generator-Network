Have you heard the one about the comedian who earns more than most Premier League footballers?

Publicly available accounts have revealed Britain's funny men - and women - are laughing all the way to the bank, out earning some of the most high profile football stars.

Peter Kay tops the list, pocketing £32.8million in the past two years – the equivalent of around £45,000 a day.

Peter Kay tops the list of the highest earning comedy stars, pocketing £32.8million in the past two years ¿ the equivalent of around £45,000 a day

Accounts from  Mr Kay, 39, reveal his earnings are channeled through his two businesses Goodnight Vienna and Hussein Traders, the Sunday Mirror reports.

The Bolton born star's massive earnings even dwarf those of Premiership footballers such as Wayne Rooney, who earns £11million a year.

The
extraordinary sums mark a shift towards a new breed of super stand-ups,
who can fill the country’s largest stadiums just like major pop stars.

It is a far cry from the days when comedians played small theatres and 
pub backrooms.

Michael McIntyre, 37, is the next highest earner according to the list with earnings topping £21m

John Bishop, 46, is in third reporting profits of £6.3m in two years

Today Kay, 39, boasts sell-out performances at the O2 
Arena and a show finale that includes pyrotechnics.

Michael McIntyre, 37, is the next highest earner according to the list with earnings topping £21m.

John Bishop, 46, is in third reporting profits of £6.3m in two years, and Jack Dee, 51, sits at fourth  having earned £5.2m in the past year.

Russell Howard, 33, who earned £4m in two years, is fifth.

The highest-earning woman is northerner Sarah ­Millican, 37, with £2m at number nine.

The prospect of high profits has tempted many comedians back out on to the road.

Kay's tour last year followed a seven-year gap and Bishop claimed last May that he would be taking two years off, only to announce a new tour five months later.

Veteran comedian John Cleese, 72, also embarked on a two-month Alimony Tour after his £12.5million divorce settlement took a chunk out of his fortune.
