A foster mother of 18 children wept in the dock as she was sentenced for the manslaughter of a disabled two-year-old girl who choked on a peanut butter sandwich in her care.

Wendy Leeck, 45, had been caring for Debra Johnson for 11 months when the child died eating the snack last August at her home in Saginaw, Michigan.

Today she was ordered to wear a tether for three months, ordered to pay $700 fines and $720 costs, and put on probation for two years after being found guilty of attempted third-degree child abuse. 

Guilty: Wendy Leeck, 45, pleaded no contest to a charge of third-degree attempted child abuse after her disabled two-year-old foster daughter choked to death on a piece of bread with peanut butter she handed her

Leeck pleaded no contest in August, MLive reported.

In an emotional speech at Saginaw County District Court today, Leeck, who fostered 18 children, told the judge: 'The pain of her loss never goes away. I will never be able to help another child.

'All the good I have done is gone. All of a sudden I became a monster.'

At a previous hearing, Leeck described how the children she cared for had come from underprivileged backgrounds, claiming they would consume all their food and drink quickly because 'they didn't know if the next meal would come'.

The day Debra died, she said, she handed the little girl a folded slice of bread with peanut butter on it as she unloaded groceries.

Around 10 minutes later, the 29-month-old child start to choke.

Despite attempting to pull the food from Debra's airways, Leeck could not save the child.

'Monster': The foster mother of 18 children wept as she said all the good she has done has gone now

Judge Randall Jurrens acknowledged Leeck is a 'special person' for caring for disabled children and noted the Debra's death was accidental.

However, an initial hearing found her understanding of Debra's disabilities showed her 'gross negligence' in handing the child the sandwich. 

She has now had her fostering license revoked and has been placed on a register for neglectful parents. 

Leeck's attorney James Gust said: 'Wendy Leeck is not a person that should go to prison,' he said.

'I've won cases I shouldn't have won, but on some occasions, I've lost some and I couldn't understand why.'
