A teacher who bravely came out to his entire school during an assembly said today he was ’overwhelmed’ after a letter he received from a former pupil went viral.

David Weston was working at Watford Grammar School in 2010 when he decided to use a school assembly to tell the entire student body he was homosexual.

Two days ago, four years after the event, David, received a message from a former pupil Richard Miah via LinkedIn, thanking him and telling him that by his simple act of courage he had ‘challenged the ignorance of so many people.’

David tweeted the email on his personal account two days ago and it has been retweeted an astonishing 4000 times since then

David, who now works for the Teacher Development Trust, tweeted the email on his personal account saying ‘I came out as a gay teacher in a whole-school assembly in 2010. Today, four years later, I just received this email. Wow’,

It has since spread across the web, being retweeted over 3,600 times and favourited 4,800 times, prompting a slew of responses on Twitter praising David and being picked up by national media. 

Speaking to MailOnline, David said: 'In 2005 as my mum was dying of lung cancer, I was diagnosed with a rare liver condition which made me very ill for four years. I was in work only on and off, and finally had to have a life-saving liver transplant in 2009.

'As I recovered from that I realised that I'd been so lucky to have a second chance and I knew I wanted to make a difference.

'I decided to do an assembly on homophobic language and why some people are gay. That was the moment where I said "as some of you already know, I'm due to be civil partnered to my boyfriend later this year. I want to talk to you about what a Civil Partnership is, how legislation has changed, and about the words we use to talk about LGBT issues'

David began working at Watford Grammar in 2003 and says that he received a positive, if quiet, reaction to his assembly.

'A couple of teachers and students told me how much they'd enjoy it and appreciated me 'being brave'. Most students had no reaction at all, or maybe occasionally asked about how my partner was. There was no negative reaction at all from anyone, including parents.'

This low-key response at the time has meant the vast national interest in the letter has come as a total shock to David.

David 
says: 'I'm blown away by the reaction. People have been so, so 
supportive and lovely. I'm humbled by the lovely messages and slightly 
shaken at the way it has gone viral - this is the sort of thing that 
happens to other people.

'The last 48 hours have been some of the 
strangest of my life, with so much radio, TV and newspaper interviews. 
I'm looking forward to getting back to normality, to be honest, to work 
on my charity with my amazing colleagues.'

The
 touching and simply worded email, which Richard told BBC 5 Live he sent
 because "David should get the recognition he deserves", says: ‘I just 
wanted you to know how inspirational your assembly was, and how much of a
 positive impact it had on the school.'

'I am a heterosexual man myself but have always been proactive in the fight against homophobia.

‘I
 know this message may seem a little pointless but I really felt you 
should know that you challenged the ignorance of so many people that 
day, and if every gay teacher shared your courage, then the world would 
be a much better place - not just for gay men – but for all of us. For 
that, I thank you.

‘They may not quite have had the wherewithal to tell you so, but so many of the students had so much respect for you for what you did - never had we witnessed a teacher perform so honestly the act for which they were employed - the act of teaching .

‘I will carry the memory with me for the rest of my life. Thank you.’

Commenting on the unprecedented national response to this moving story Andrew Gilliver, from the Gay and Lesbian Foundation told the MailOnline: 'David’s experience shows us the courage it can take to come out in the workplace and also the importance of positive role models for young people.

'It is wonderful to hear that all these years later, one of his pupils still remembers the positive effect David Weston’s honesty had on them.

'We hope this sends out a message of support to all those people who are worried about coming out, whether they are a young person or an adult.

'David’s story demonstrates how important it is to live in a society where we can discuss things such as sexual orientation openly without fear or prejudice, but also how important it is for young people to have positive support and guidance.

'Everyone at The Lesbian & Gay Foundation would like to wish David all the best and if anyone reading this needs to talk about their own situation they can contact us in total confidence.'
