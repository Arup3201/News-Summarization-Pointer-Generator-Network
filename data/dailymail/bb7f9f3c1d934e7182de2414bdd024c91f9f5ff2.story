A 93-year-old daredevil jumped from a plane at 10,000ft with his late wife's ashes strapped to his chest.

Jack Hake carried the remains of his wife Veronica with him when he did the charity skydive because throughout their 70-year marriage the pair 'did everything together'.

The Second World War veteran, from Wimborne, Dorset, told his wife that he wanted her to be with him when he does the jump as she lay on her death bed.

Tribute: Jack Hake did everything together throughout their life together, and he didn't want the skydive to be any different

He kept his heart-breaking promise as he plunged from a plane attached to a skydiving instructor over Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire.

Mr Hake, who has undergone surgery for a triple heart bypass, said: 'It all went very well and I jumped from 10,000ft.

'I had to be lifted into the plane because I couldn’t walk but I wasn’t nervous. On the way down it felt like we put on quite an aerobatic show.

'There were about 150 people waiting for me on the ground - it was amazing. My wife was with me of course - I emptied her ashes into a bag and strapped it to my chest.

'My wife and I were married for 70 years and we did everything together. We’ve done it all - boating, fishing, cycling. You name it, we did it together.

'We have never been apart.'

Charity: He undertook the jump to raise money for the GP surgery that treated his wife

Mr Hake has raised £600 for the GP surgery that treated his 95-year-old wife before she died - and now hopes to raise more.

He added: 'Before my wife died we had a chat and we agreed we had to do something to raise money for the surgery. We’re not wealthy so we decided to do something sponsored like a skydive.

'I promised to take her with me and I did just that. I thought it was just a walk in the park really and I’m sure she would have thought the same.

'I’m not a hero - I just did what my wife wanted me to do.'

Donna Wood, a district nurse who looks after Jack and helped him organise the skydive, said: 'Jack wasn’t fazed in the slightest - he showed no signs of nerves whatsoever.

'He was absolutely brilliant. We were so lucky with the weather - it was bright sunshine and clear blue skies.'Jack said to me afterwards that it was all plain sailing.'
