The TOWIE beauty is a huge dance music fan and is currently promoting the show’s first ever CD; The Only Way is Marbs: Marbella Anthems.

Stars from the show including Lydia Bright and James 'Diags' Bennewit attended the The CD’s launch party at The Brickyard in Essex on Friday.

Lauren Pope's holiday tips: TOWIE star picks out her best nightspots exclusively for Travel Mail readers

Day and night: The terrace at luxury beach club Nikki Beach stays open until late

Lauren said: 'I’ve loved working on this album - from the track selection to the mixing, it’s been an amazing experience.

‘It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a while and I’m delighted to get the opportunity to do it now.

‘I love dance music and I wanted that to be reflected in my selections.'

As well as nightspots, Lauren has also told us her Top. 5 other things to do in Marbella.

And she's let us know what are her must-pack essentials.

Aqua Mist. It
 has such cool little back room hidden away with a Jacuzzi in it, not 
that I've ever been in it, I dread to think whats gone on in there! But it's great just to go and have a look. They also get some good name DJs playing there which is right up my street.

La Sala. It’s
 a lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere, they have live singers in 
there. It’s a bar as well, so you can go and eat yummy food then relax 
on the terrace with a few drinks.

Tibu. I’ve DJ'd here a few times and it’s a great venue playing a mixture of house, R 'n' B and hip hop. Its pretty big and open late so if it’s a big night you're after i’d suggest going here.

Nikki Beach.
 This is such a lovely and chic place to hang out, its a little bit away
 from the port which isn't a bad thing. It has a chilled out day vibe 
and then when it gets dark the party starts with dancers and 
entertainers and its really cool to dance the night away under the 
stars.

Pangea.
 It’s an outside rooftop bar/club and its a great place to start your 
night. The music is a mix of everything and isn't too loud so its a 
great sociable place to catch up with your friends before gong to 
somewhere like Tibu.

The star was in Marbella for the annual TOWIE special set in the popular holiday hotspot, but she has also been busy with other work commitments.

The 31-year-old recently launched her own clothing collection for e-tailer inthestyle.co.uk and was joined by TOWIE favourite, 24-year-old Lydia Bright for the London celebration.

Speaking about her 26-piece range, the model and DJ told MailOnline: 'It is full of key pieces and items you would see me wearing. I'm really excited for people to see it.'

The designer, who models the whole range herself, explained that she's added a lot more colour and softer fabrics, as well as sharp tailoring to the collection.

Keen walker: Lauren enjoys taking time out to walk along the beach and explore the local area

The tropical-inspired range features an eclectic mix of dresses, jumpsuits, skirts and co-ord sets.

Speaking about her inspiration, she said: 'I always look to catwalks for inspiration and to fashion bloggers and some celebrities but once I see something I like, I tend to give it a little twist of my own, we don't want to be a copy of anything else out there.'

Lauren, who cites her favourite designers as Balenciaga, Balmain, Celine and Saint Laurent and loves to shop at Zara, Oasis, River Island and Missguided on the high street, says she finds it hard to describe her personal style.

'It's hard to describe as I tend to chuck different styles together and if I like something I will wear it. I love keeping it chic with an edgy twist,' she said.

Walking. I love to go walking so I often put my trainers on and just head out of the hotel on a little wonder and see what’s around. There’s a whole other world just away from the port that is so cool.Eating out. I love, love, love going for dinner on holiday. Sitting outside with a glass of wine is a great way to kickstart your night. Marbella has so many cool restaurants to choose from. La Sela is lovely.Pool Parties. Marbs has a lot of well known pool parties, Ocean Club has a big Champagne Spray party once a month which is a must to experience, i still find it mad that people spend a fortune on champagne to just spray it all over each other!

Take a boat out for the day. Hire a boat with some friends, take a picnic and just have a chilled out day on the water.Shopping. The port has a lot of designer boutiques as well as a lot of high street shops so you can get the best of both. Its also a really pretty walk along the port and you can have a nosey at all the amazing yachts.

A killer wardrobe. My
 luggage allowance is always overweight as I find it impossible to pack 
light! I take a mix of looser fabrics and try to add in a little more 
colour. Some chic flat sandals.
 I've scrapped the wedges in the daytime now and much prefer a more 
relaxed look at the beach or at a pool party so I'm always on the look 
out for flats with a either embellishment details or metallic finishes.SPF.
 As I've got older I really understand about sun damage so I'm a factor 
30 girl from now on. I tend to get bored if I sunbathe for too long as 
I'd rather be doing something active. But you still need to remember to 
cover yourself from head-to-toe in suncream.Some fabulous friends.
 A holiday is not complete with out some great company. I was lucky to 
have my best friend Vas with me in Marbs recently and he makes me laugh 
so much. A holiday is a time to relax and chill so I love travelling 
with people who aren't uptight and are happy to go with the flow.Hair Extensions and Hairpieces.
 I own my own brand of hair extensions and pieces called Hair Rehab 
London and they are a life saver on holiday. No one wants to waste their
 time blow-drying
 their hair and when you're away it tends to go a little bit frizzy so I
 take a selection of extensions and pieces that just clip in and out.
