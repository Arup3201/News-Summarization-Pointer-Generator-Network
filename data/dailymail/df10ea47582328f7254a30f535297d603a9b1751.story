Veteran Dolphins players have been accused of forcing newer recruits to fund their lavish lifestyles including $30,000 dinners and trips to Las Vegas.

According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald on Sunday, the alleged bank-rolling is behind Jonathon Martin's shock leave of absence from the team last week.

ESPN claims lineman Richie Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to Vegas last summer, even though he didn't attend. However, Incognito quickly disputed the report on Twitter.

Meanwhile, the Herald reported that one unnamed young player had coughed up so much cash to veterans that he's gone broke.

Reporter Adam Beasley tweeted: 'Recently, a younger player was handed the tab for a $30,000 team dinner. The rookie minimum this year is around $400.000.'

Two tweets from Jared Odrick and Will Davis support the accusation.

'Everything tastes better when 
rookies pay for it,' Odrick tweeted on November 2, while Davis wrote 'I 
just seen a dinner bill for $30,000... WOW #RookieNight'

The team came out on Sunday labelling the accusations of bullying 'speculation.'

They added that their number one concern was Martin's health and well-being.

'The Miami Dolphins, including Coach Joe Philbin and Jonathan's teammates, have been in communication with Jonathan and his family since his departure from the club and continue to be in contact. Our primary concern for Jonathan is his overall health and well-being,' the statement read.

'As an organization, we take any accusations of player misconduct seriously. The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally. The reports that the NFLPA is investigating our players are inaccurate. Additionally, the NFL offered its assistance during this time, which we appreciated and gladly accepted. We will continue to make Jonathan's health and well-being a focus as we do with all of our players.'

After ESPN reporters Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefer's latest story, Incognito took to Twitter to rubbish the claims against him, writing '@AdamSchefter Stop slandering my name. You hide behind 'sources' who are not man enough to put their name behind the BS you report.'

Leave: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin, 24, pictured, had taken a personal leave of absence from the team which has been blamed on the persistent teasing of his teammates

Three minutes later, the player 
added: '@AdamSchefter This is the second time you have tried to drag my 
name through the mud with with lies.'

It was first reported on Friday that tackle Jonathan Martin had taken a personal leave of absence from the team because of persistent bullying and teasing at the hands of certain teammates.

Martin,
 nicknamed 'Big Weirdo' by some teammates has apparently been plagued by
 bullying since joining Miami as a 2012 second-round draft choice.

The
 latest taunts prompted Martin to leave Dolphins headquarters on Monday 
after a group of players stood up and left when he tried joining them 
for lunch.

The incident caused Martin, 24, to finally reach his limit and walk out, reports FOX Sports.

Martin is receiving professional assistance for emotional issues.

A person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press that Martin is with relatives and doesn't have any problems with the coaching staff.

Educated: The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University

The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University.

He played in last Sunday's loss at New England, then missed practice during the week. He was replaced by Tyson Clabo in Thursday night's game against Cincinnati.

A second-round draft pick from Stanford, Martin started every game at right tackle as a rookie last year. He switched to left tackle this season, then moved back to the right side last month in a reshuffling of the Dolphins' struggling offensive line.

'You can approach this two different ways,' Martin said regarding his latest position switch at the time.

'You can go in the tank and be one of those guys that moans and is a cancer in the locker room, or you can be a professional and play as hard as you can. My mindset is I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to help the team win.'

Pass protection has been a problem for Miami all season. Ryan Tannehill went into the Bengals game with an NFL-high 32 sacks, and the Dolphins (3-4) were saddled with a four-game losing streak.

Martin's agent didn't respond to requests for comment. The walkout raises questions about Martin's future with the franchise.

The NFL Players Association is monitoring the situation and has made inquiries into determining what has happened with Martin, a source told FOX Sports.

Martin, posted a message on Facebook that read, in part, 'Happy Halloween! Don't believe everything you read.'

The message also reportedly added, 'Opinions are like (expletive), everyone has one.'
