Eating fruit and grains is an important step for boosting male fertility

Cutting down on red meat, coffee and alcohol can boost a man's fertility scientists say.

A study has discovered that a poor diet and obesity can lower sperm concentration and affect their ability to swim towards an egg.

Specialists are now encouraging a diet high in fruit and grains to increase the chances of successful IVF treatment.

In the past female fertility problems have been linked to obesity as well 
as smoking and drinking, but it hasn't been clear before now if the same 
applies to men.

But the latest study of men with partners who were undergoing a type of fertility treatment, has revealed that those who regularly drank alcohol and ate poorly were slowed down on the fertility front.

Lead researcher Edson Borges, from the Fertility-Assisted Fertilization Center in Sao Paolo said: 'The sperm concentration was negatively 
influenced by body mass index (BMI) and alcohol consumption, and was 
positively influenced by cereal consumption and the number of meals per 
day.'

The Brazilian study involved 250 men with partners who were undergoing a type of fertility treatment called 
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

Each participant was asked how often they ate a range of foods, including fruits and 
vegetables, beans, grains, meat and fish, as well as how much they drank
 and smoked.

Semen samples were then analysed to 
assess sperm health and concentration and each couple were monitored 
during theÂ  IVF process.

Eggs were successfully fertilised in 
about three-quarters of the treatments, and just under forty per cent of women
 got pregnant during the study.

From the speed of their sperm to their 
partner's chance of pregnancy, men who drank and had a poor diet were less fertile.

Lynn Westphal, a women's health 
and fertility specialist at Stanford University hopes that the results, published in the Fertility and Sterility journal, will encourage men to make healthier lifestyle choices.

'We talk about having a healthy 
lifestyle and trying to eliminate any of these things that are bad for 
health, but I think most of the emphasis tends to be on making sure the 
woman is as healthy as possible.

'I think this is really interesting data
 that lifestyle factors for men, even when you're doing ICSI, are 
significant.

'This is probably more of a difference than most people 
would have thought.'
