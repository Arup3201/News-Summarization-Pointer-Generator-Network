Google’s chief executive has admitted his surprise that Apple has not sued the search giant.

‘It's extremely curious that Apple has chosen to sue Google's partners and not Google itself,' said Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

He claimed he was trying to deal with the enmity between the two tech giants in an ‘adult’ way but that things were still strained.

He also acknowledged that the public think they are like two angry teenagers taunting each other with the words: ‘I have a gun, you have a gun, who shoots first?'

Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, has admitted the firm's relationship with Apple has soured to point the firms are 'throwing bombs at each other'

One of the biggest current rows between the firms is over mapping software, after Apple decided to dump Google and create its own maps.

However, the firm has struggled, and was forced to issue a humiliating apology to customers.

Google is developing its own map app for Apple's gadgets, but has not revealed when it will be released.

Relations between Google and Apple have been arctic long before the death of Apple founder Steve Jobs, who made it his personal mission to take down his rival.

In his biography of Jobs, who died in October last year, Walter Isaacson revealed that once raged he would ‘go to thermonuclear war’ to get revenge for stealing Apple designs.

Jobs supposedly said: ‘Our lawsuit is saying, 'Google you f****** ripped off the iPhone, wholesale ripped us off.

‘I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40bn (£25bn) the bank, to right this wrong.

'I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product.’

More recently Apple stopped using Google Maps on the iPhone 5 and the new iPad and removed Google’s YouTube as an icon from the home screen too in an escalation of hostilities.

Speaking to the Wall St Journal, Schmidt, who is Google’s executive chairman, said that over the past year things had been ‘on and off’ with Apple.

He said: ‘Obviously, we would have preferred them to use our maps.

‘They threw YouTube off the home screen (of iPhones and iPads).

I'm not quite sure why they did that.

‘The press would like to write the sort of teenage model of competition, which is, 'I have a gun, you have a gun, who shoots first?'

‘The adult way to run a business is to run it more like a country.

‘They have disputes, yet they've actually been able to have huge trade with each other.

According to his biography, Steve Jobs vowed to 'spend my last dying breath' defeating Android, Google's mobile phone and tablet software.

‘They're not sending bombs at each other.

‘I think both Tim (Cook, Apple's chief executive) and Larry (Page, Google's chief executive) the sort of successors to Steve (Jobs) and me if you will, have an understanding of this state model.

‘When they and their teams meet, they have just a long list of things to talk about.’

Another twist to the Apple and Google row is the patent lawsuit that Apple brought against Samsung over its Galaxy 3S smartphone.

Earlier this year a California jury awarded Apple $1bn (£622m) because they thought that Samsung had ripped off its designs.

Lawyers for both companies used ripe language to accuse the other of theft with Apple alleging that Samsung ‘flagrantly copied’ its products.

Observers have however suggested that the lawsuit was a ‘proxy war’ and that Apple may yet sue Google directly.

Asked about the ongoing legal action, Schmidt said: ‘Apple and Google are well aware of the legal strategies of each other.

‘Part of the conversations that are going on all the time is to talk about them.

‘It's extremely curious that Apple has chosen to sue Google's partners and not Google itself.’
