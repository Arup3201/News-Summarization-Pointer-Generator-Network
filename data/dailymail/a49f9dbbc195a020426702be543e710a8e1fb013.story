Email alert: Sir Bruce Keogh urged officials three months ago to launch a series of investigations

Health bosses have been accused of trying to cover up high death rates and alarming waiting times in the NHS in Wales.

The medical director in England Professor Sir Bruce Keogh urged officials three months ago to launch a series of investigations into six hospitals after being alerted to the figures by a Welsh Labour MP.

He also pointed out that waiting times in Wales were ‘persistently higher’ than in England, with up to 80 per cent of patients waiting more than six weeks for key diagnostic tests for diseases such as cancer.

However bosses didn’t reply to his email – nor did they launch any investigation.

The revelation comes amid growing concern over the state of the NHS in Wales.

Labour – which has been in power in Wales since devolution in 1999 – runs the country’s NHS separately from the health service in England.

It has not ring-fenced the NHS budget as the Coalition has done. Instead spending on the Welsh NHS has been slashed by 11 per cent since 2011.

There is now growing evidence that the financial cuts are having a knock-on effect on waiting times, in A&E and on the overall standards of care in hospitals.

At one hospital, three nurses have been arrested amid claims of serious patient neglect.

The Princess of Wales hospital in Bridgend was already under the spotlight over the death of a patient who waited four hours in an ambulance before being admitted to A&E.

In his email, sent to his Welsh counterpart Dr Chris Jones on November 28 last year, Sir Bruce pointed to figures showing that around 50 per cent of Welsh patients wait at least six weeks for bowel cancer scans compared to around 1 to 2 per cent in England.

Similarly for MRI scans – which are used to detect everything from cancer, dementia and muscular injuries – 48.6 per cent of patients wait six weeks or more compared to less than 1 per cent of English patients.

And 80 per cent of patients were waiting 6 weeks or longer for urine tests which can be used to detect bladder cancer.

Sir Bruce wrote: ‘There are six hospitals with a persistently high mortality which warrant investigating.‘I do not have adequate data to form a view. 

‘Waiting times in A&E are considerably worse than England, but the real concern is around prolonged (longer than 6 weeks) waiting times for diagnostics (scans which include cancer tests) including which, of course, translates to delayed treatment.’ 

Last night MPs said the situation was ‘deeply disturbing’ and accused the Labour Assembly of covering up the truth about the state of its  hospitals.

They likened the situation in Wales to other scandals such as Mid Staffordshire, which occurred when Labour was in power.

Charlotte Leslie, Tory MP for Bristol North West said: ‘This is an abominable indictment of Labour’s attitude to the NHS.

‘Now, in the last corner of the country where Labour is still in charge of health, what do we see, but exactly the same efforts to protect political self-interest over patients’ lives.

‘Just like with Mid-Staffs, we find all the effort focused not on investigating hospitals of concern, but an effort to discredit the data, potentially at the cost of peoples’ lives.’ 

The six hospitals Sir Bruce said he was concerned  about include the Princess of Wales, University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, Royal Gwent in Newport, Royal Glamorgan near Llantrisant, and three community hospitals. 

He was alerted by MP Ann Clwyd, who in 2012 exposed how her husband died like a ‘battery hen’ in a Glasgow hospital. 

The Labour MP for Cynon Valley, said: ‘The situation is deeply disturbing. I have been calling for an inquiry into death rates for some time because several of the figures are extremely worrying.

‘People in Wales ought to be able to have as good care as anywhere else, but instead here are people dying on hospital waiting lists, and suffering appalling failings in care.’ 

A Welsh Assembly spokesman said: ‘Mortality rates in Wales are published on a quarterly basis  and latest figures demonstrate clear improvement. If issues are identified, we work quickly to put them right and we do not hesitate to investigate as needed.

‘To suggest that the Welsh NHS is covering up high death rates is therefore utterly ridiculous and completely without foundation.’

Concerns: Former nurse Glenda Rodriguez-Noza

For years campaigners have been trying to get a proper investigation into claims of serious neglect at the Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend.

Cases where patients have suffered ‘prolonged, unnecessary suffering’ haunt the families involved.

Three nurses have been arrested over falsifying patient records at the hospital after staff blew the whistle.

Bereaved relatives have sought help from the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, but many are calling for a full public inquiry.

An independent review was ordered by the Welsh government, prompted by the ‘unacceptable’ care of Lillian Williams, an 82-year-old amputee who was admitted to the hospital four times before she died there in August 2012.

Her son Gareth Williams said: ‘Lillian was left Nil by Mouth on one occasion for two days without assessment because it was a weekend and the assessment teams didn’t work on the weekends. It was nothing short of torture.’ 

Doctors told Mrs Williams’s family she had pneumonia and that the hospital would withdraw support of all food, water and medication. 

She died four days later when the family insisted on a post-mortem examination.

Mr Williams said: ‘There was no pneumonia. She died of a heart attack after days without nutrition and after days deprived of life-saving medications for her heart and diabetes.

‘It was the most cruel, prolonged, unnecessarily suffering death. It haunts us.’

Former nurse Glenda Rodriguez-Noza, who worked at the hospital for eight years before leaving in 2009, says she raised several complaints about patient care but was ignored. 

She said she saw an infected room poorly cleaned before it was used by other patients, a dementia patient being roughly handled by a nurse and a nurse give the patient the wrong medication.

An urgent review is under way following the death last month of a 58-year-old man attended by paramedics in an ambulance outside the hospital for more than four hours before being admitted to the emergency department.

A statement from Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said: ‘We apologise sincerely to the patients and families who we have let down at the Princess of Wales Hospital.

‘In May 2013 we invited an external team – Advancing Quality Alliance – to review quality and safety at the hospital.

This was in response to serious complaints about care provided to some patients; critical Ombudsman’s reports; mortality rates, and a police investigation into allegations of falsification of records by some of our nurses.’
