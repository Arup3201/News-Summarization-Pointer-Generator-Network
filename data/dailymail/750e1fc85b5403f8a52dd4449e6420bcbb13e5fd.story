Police Federation Vice-chairman Steve Evans had 'no choice' but to quit after verbally abusing a female colleague after a boozy festive lunch 

A top official at the scandal-hit Police Federation has quit after verbally abusing a female colleague following a boozy Christmas lunch attended by senior officers.

Vice-chairman Steve Evans became the union’s third high-ranking member to resign under a cloud this year.

Insiders said he had no choice but to step down after having a heated altercation with the woman during which ‘very angry words were exchanged’.

Mr Evans, who has led moves to improve ‘professional standards’ in the police, had been in the post for just seven months.

In April, the Federation’s chairman and general secretary quit days after the Daily Mail revealed the union had hired a PR firm for a ‘guerrilla’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ campaign against the Government.

The Mail has run investigations revealing how the Federation, representing 125,000 rank-and-file officers, had:

The latest shameful episode happened in the bar of its £26million HQ in Leatherhead, Surrey, last week when senior officials attended their Christmas lunch.

It was described by sources as a boozy affair. Several officials retired to the bar but the mood turned when Mr Evans became involved in the ugly altercation with a female colleague.

A source said: ‘Steve lost his temper. He said things he should not have done. It was not sexist or racist, just completely inappropriate. It was witnessed by a number of people and he had no choice but to resign.’

Another told the Mail: ‘In days gone by, this sort of incident would probably have been brushed under the carpet. But in the new era of reform, it could not be tolerated.’

Mr Evans joined Derbyshire Police in 1987 and worked as a patrol officer for a decade. Later he became a Federation representative and was appointed secretary of its Sergeants Branch Board.

His profile on the union website says his interests ‘were always centred on discipline issues and within a short time he became discipline liaison officer where he gained a great deal of conduct experience’.

Mr Evans’ leading role in professional standards led to him being elected vice-chairman in May. Last night his resignation was confirmed by chairman Steve White in a statement released to the Mail.

‘There was a relatively minor incident between the vice-chair and a member of staff last Monday evening after the staff Christmas lunch had finished,’ he said.

‘All parties involved in the disagreement had consumed alcohol and while the incident was relatively minor, the vice-chair felt he should offer his resignation.

‘On a personal level. I would say that Steve’s contribution to the Federation during a period of unprecedented change had been exemplary and will be missed.’

Mr White added that the union ‘has moved on significantly’ since setting up an independent review by former Home Office mandarin Sir David Normington last year.

‘We will not accept any behaviour which could be perceived to undermine the professional standards we uphold,’ he said.

Mr Evans has declined to comment but the union said he plans to retire in April and join his wife in the Caribbean where she works.

The Federation’s then chairman Steve Williams and general secretary Ian Rennie quit in April after the Mail’s PR revelations.

Both knew of the decision to award a minimum £10,000-a-month deal to a public relations company to oppose Coalition plans to change police pay and reform.

The plan was agreed weeks before the Plebgate clash in 2012 between then chief whip Andrew Mitchell and a policeman in Downing Street. Critics argue the Federation mercilessly exploited this in its campaign against ministers.
