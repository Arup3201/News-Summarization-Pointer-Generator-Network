Tremendous grief: Mark Fear, born Francis, left a note saying he could not live without Kenneth

Acclaimed TV host Kenneth Kendall's grief-stricken partner killed himself after the veteran broadcaster's death having left a note saying he 'simply could not face the future' without him, an inquest heard.

Francis Fear, 55, was found hanging at his Â£500,000 home just four months after the death of his partner of 23 years.

Friends told the hearing today how the death of Mr Kendall - best known for presenting the hit series Treasure Hunt with Anneka Rice - had had a 'radical effect' on the art gallery owner who was known by his middle name Mark.

Mr Kendall was 88 when, last December, he suffered a fatal stroke.

In April this year, Mark Fear was found with a note left by his body at the three-bedroom home he had shared with his civil partner.

Addressed to his friend Vicki Wyatt, it read: 'I am sorry to land you in all this.

'I simply cannot face the future without Kenneth. M x'

The former interior designer also left instructions for her to look at the Notes application in his iPhone where his will and other documents could be found.

Mr Fear had met the former presenter of Channel 4's Treasure Hunt in London and the couple had entered into a civil partnership in 2006.

They opened the Kendall Fine Art gallery in Cowes on the Isle of Wight together where they moved following the presenter's retirement.

Mr Kendall was well known for making history on September 4, 1955, by becoming the first BBC newsreader to appear on TV.

He
later co-starred in the popular game show Treasure Hunt where he 
directed Anneka Rice around the country in a helicopter to search for 
clues.

Friend Neil Robertson
told the hearing that Mr Kendall's death had hit Mr Fear hard and with 
his partner, Miss Wyatt, they had attempted to help him cope with his 
grief.

He said: 'It had a radical effect on him.'

'He
had concerns on a number of levels, principally the grief after losing 
his partner, concerns about the viability of the business and the 
economic status given the role Kenneth his partner played in providing 
income and presence in the gallery.'

It is thought that Mr Fear struggled following the death of his partner of a stroke in December

Family and friends recognised that the keen sailor and former vice-commodore at the Royal London Yacht Club, was having difficulty coping and was prone to 'dark moods' so had rallied around him.

Towards the end of February and the beginning of March, it appeared as though Mr Fear was improving.

'We all felt he was looking forward with positive thoughts about the future,' said Mr Robertson.

He said that he last saw Mr Fear on the night before his death and together they watched their beloved Manchester United play on the television when he seemed to be 'relatively happy'.

'We talked about a number of issues, apart from the football about the social programme, moving forward, potential holidays, everything was positive, everything was the future,' he said.

However, as he left, Mr Robertson added that he had found it 'eerie' when Mr Fear said to him: 'I've really enjoyed watching these Manchester United games with you.'

The alarm was raised the following day when Mr Fear failed to turn up for an appointment at the gallery.

'By this stage I could almost say I knew what had happened,' said Mr Robertson.

Mr Robertson and Miss Wyatt discovered Mr Fear hanged in his home on April 29.

Police attended the home in Castle Road and found no suspicious circumstances and a post mortem examination concluded that the death was caused by asphyxia.

Assistant coroner for the Isle of Wight, John Matthews, said: 'He had suffered a tremendous grief following the death of partner in December 2012.

'His friends were very concerned about him, certainly the first month or two after his death and to an extent really looked after him to ensure as much as possible he wasn't on his own.

'He seemed to get better and his friends were hopeful that he would get back to a normal keel and indeed he was making plans with friend Mr Robertson for future holidays together and planning to watch more TV football matches.

'To all intents and purposes he was recovering and starting a new life without his partner.

'Sadly, we know that was not the case and it was not entirely a surprise when he was found dead.'

The coroner recorded a verdict of suicide.

The inquest heard that Mr Fear had a passion for sailing, was a co-owner of a racing yacht and owned a motorboat which he used to go on holidays with Mr Robertson and Miss Wyatt to the Channel Islands and to France.

Speaking after the hearing, Miss Wyatt said: 'We had lots of adventures together with Mark, we had lots of fun together.'

She added: 'Mark Fear and Kenneth Kendall had a 23-year relationship, and as civil partners from the earliest opportunity, their relationship was worthy of the greatest admiration and respect.'

Mr Kendall had joined the BBC as a radio announcer before he became the first newsreader to appear in vision.

He also featured in the Doctor Who serial The War Machines and had a cameo role as a newsreader in 2001: A Space Odyssey.
