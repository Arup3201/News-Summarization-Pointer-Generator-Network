Given the intensifying public anger this week at the richest men in America, Rupert Murdoch can’t have been that surprised when he was heckled during a speech by Occupy Wall Street protesters.

The News Corp CEO was shouted at during a speech at an education forum in San Francisco, California, by demonstrators who accused him of trying to profit from public education.

Activists repeatedly interrupted Mr Murdoch as he gave a keynote speech at a downtown hotel about how technology could help transform the nation's public education system.

Mr Hill yelled: 'Corporations own all the media in the world. Why should they not own all the education as well?'

‘Equality in education, not privatisation!’ one woman shouted as security guards escorted her out of the ballroom of the Palace Hotel, which hosted the National Summit on Education Reform.

‘Corporations own all the media in the world. Why should they not own all the education as well?’ activist Joe Hill yelled sarcastically.

Mr Hill, who was dressed as the ‘Count’ character from the TV show ‘Sesame Street,’ was also pushed out of the meeting room.

But Mr Murdoch appeared unfazed by the commotion. ‘It's OK, a little controversy makes everything more interesting,’ he said to audience applause before continuing his half-hour speech.

About half a dozen hecklers were escorted out of the hotel after they disrupted Mr Murdoch's speech, but said they were not arrested.

They joined about two dozen protesters holding signs and chanting ‘Occupy Wall Street! Occupy Sesame Street!’ outside the conference.

Mr Hill later accused Mr Murdoch and other corporate leaders of trying to ‘use the economic crisis to further privatise education and divert more public funds into private corporate interests’.

Mr Murdoch appeared as part of a two-day education forum sponsored by the Foundation for Excellence in Education, a group chaired by former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.

It champions school vouchers, charter schools, performance pay for teachers and digital learning.

‘We need to tear down an education system designed for the 19th century and replace it with one suited for the 21st,’ Mr Murdoch said during his morning address.

‘You don't get change by plugging in computers at schools designed for the industrial age. You get it by developing technology that rewrites the rules of the game by centring learning around the learner.’

Last year, News Corp acquired Wireless Generation, a company based in Brooklyn, New York, that provides software and services to K-12 schools.

In August, New York's comptroller rejected a $27million contract with the educational technology company because of the phone-hacking scandal involving News Corp's British newspapers.

On Thursday afternoon more than 100 protesters, mostly San Francisco teachers, picketed outside the hotel, protesting Mr Murdoch's presence at the education conference.

In July Mr Murdoch was attacked with a custard pie by comedian Jonnie Marbles while giving evidence on hacking to the UK House of Commons' Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.
