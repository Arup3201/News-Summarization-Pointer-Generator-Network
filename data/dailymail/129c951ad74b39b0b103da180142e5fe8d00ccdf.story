Private investigators have been brought in to track down hundreds of European graduates who studied at British universities but owe £52million in loans for tuition fees.

Amid fears that one in four of them will never repay a penny, the Student Loans Company (SLC) said the EU nationals have returned home and now reached the income threshold at which they should be paying off their loans.

And while some have slipped into arrears, many more – accounting for loans of £41million – have refused to reveal where they live, whether they are working, or how much they are earning. If the debts are not repaid, British taxpayers will have to foot the bill – meaning foreign students are effectively receiving grants to study in the UK while English students have to fork out a fortune for their higher education.

Turning their backs on repayments: Overseas graduates have failed to repay their student loans after leaving the UK

Rob Wilson MP, a former Tory education
spokesman, said: ‘The SLC has been put in a difficult position by the 
nonsense of being forced to allow EU students equal access to financial 
support.’ Students from Cyprus borrowed the most from the SLC, but 
£15million of their £24million debt is not being repaid, while graduates
from France, Germany and Poland ran up debts of more than £10million.

It is the first time that the total amount of debt owed by EU graduates to the SLC has passed the £50million mark.

Andrew Percy, a Tory MP, said: ‘With 
British students paying more in tuition fees than ever before, many 
people will not understand how it is possible that foreign students are 
able to turn up, run up taxpayer-backed debts and then leave.

Many of these students will never contribute a penny in income tax to the UK and will be incredibly expensive to track down.’

Kevin O’Connor, head of SLC repayment,
said: ‘We use international trace agents and can commence legal action 
to recover the full balance.’

A spokesman for the Department for 
Business, Innovation and Skills added: ‘We will obtain court orders in 
other jurisdictions if necessary.’

Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance said: ‘It’s important they get the money owed in full so that 
UK taxpayers are not left paying off huge sums of student debt.’

Anger: The news that EU graduates are failing to pay back their student loans comes as British students are facing higher tuition fees than ever before - prompting protests in November 2012
