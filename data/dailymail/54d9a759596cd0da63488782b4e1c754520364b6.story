A pair of twin babies was safely delivered during a Russian flight when one of the passengers unexpectedly went into labour.

Irina Vasylkova was in the 35th week of her pregnancy when she boarded the Polar Airlines flight from Zyryanka, in the East Russian Sakha Republic to Yakutsk, the capital city of the Sakha Republic.

But 
shortly into the journey the 25-year-old began to experience labour pains.

Delivery: The first baby was born while the plane was airborne and the second arrived as it landed

Stewardess Christina 
Kondratiev first moved the young woman to a seat with more legroom, and then attempted to make her feel relaxed, in the hope that the 
delivery would wait until the plane could land.

She said: 'I told the pilot and he sped up the flight to make sure that we could arrive as early as possible, but it was clear that the delivery was not going to wait.'Â 

Staying calm: Stewardess Christina Kondratiev alerted the pilot and asked if there were any doctors on board

Generous: Polar Airlines are preparing gifts for the mother and her twin babies, including free travel for life on any of their planes

She then made an appeal to 
see if there was a doctor on board the type AN-26 aircraft, and was 
rewarded with a positive reply when obstetrician Elena Sleptcova, 47, 
stepped up and offered to help.

The first baby was born while the plane was airborne and the second was born just as it landed, giving the new mother twin girls before she was wheeled out into the arrivals lounge.

Mother and daughters were taken to a local hospital where all three are doing fine, and the new arrivals have already met their older sister, Angelina, aged four.

And as a special bonus, Polar Airlines are preparing gifts for the mother and her 
twin babies, including free travel for life on any Polar 
Airlines plane.
