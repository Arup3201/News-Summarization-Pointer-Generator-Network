TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson escaped the furore surrounding his BBC suspension by heading to Stamford Bridge for Chelsea's crunch clash with PSG.

The 54-year-old Top Gear presenter was suspended on Tuesday for allegedly punching a producer in a fight over food.

And 24 hours later Chelsea fan Clarkson was spotted cheering on Jose Mourinho's men in the Champions League last 16 second leg tie. 

But the  night ended in disappointment as Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League on away goals after extra time.

Clarkson is being investigated for allegedly 'smacking' Oisin Tymon, 36, in the face after being told there was no hot food after a day's filming in Newcastle.

More than 500,000 supporters have signed a petition demanding he is reinstated by the BBC while many more used the #BringBackClarkson and #jesuisClarkson hashtags to show support.

The online petition has become the fastest-growing ever to be hosted by Change.org - beating other high-profile campaigns including attempts to get The Sun to drop its topless page three models which received 240,000.

Co-presenter James May admitted his friend was involved in a 'bit of a dust up' over dinner where a punch may have been thrown, but said the row was not 'serious'.

The BBC has decided Top Gear will not be aired on Sunday and the further two remaining episodes of this year's series may also be axed while he is investigated.

But Mr Clarkson, whose BBC contract expires this month, is considering quitting Top Gear even if he is cleared of punching Mr Tymon and moving to a rival TV network, a friend said.
