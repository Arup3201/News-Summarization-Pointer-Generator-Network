Lib Dem MP David Ward has been summoned to meet party enforcers next week to explain the comments about the Holocaust he posted on his website

A Liberal Democrat MP facing disciplinary action after accusing 'the Jews' of atrocities against Palestinians has issued a public apology for causing 'unintended offence.'

David Ward's comments - posted on his website ahead of tomorrow's Holocaust Memorial Day - were condemned by party chiefs and sparked a furious backlash.

He initially strongly defended the article and hit out at criticisms by the party - which summoned him to the Whip's Office for a meeting on Monday morning.

But in a new post this afternoon he said he 'never for a moment intended to criticise or offend the Jewish people as a whole, either as a race or as a people of faith, and apologise sincerely for the unintended offence which my words caused.'

'I recognise of course the deep sensitivities of these issues at all times, and particularly on occasions of commemoration such as this weekend,' he added.

Mr Ward said that in raising the treatment of the Palestinians he had simply been 'trying to make clear that everybody needs to learn the lessons of the Holocaust.'

'I will continue to make criticisms of actions in Palestine in the strongest possible terms for as long as Israel continues to oppress the Palestinian people,' he added.

The Bradford East MP composed his original posting after signing a Holocaust memorial book in the city, describing Auschwitz as 'the Nazi concentration and extermination camp which is the site of the largest mass murder in history.'

But in the addition which caused the 
uproar, he added: 'Having visited Auschwitz twice - once with my family 
and once with local schools - I am saddened that the Jews, who suffered 
unbelievable levels of persecution during the Holocaust, could within a 
few years of liberation from the death camps be inflicting atrocities on
 Palestinians in the new State of Israel and continue to do so on a 
daily basis in the West Bank and Gaza.'

A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: 
‘This is a matter we take extremely seriously. The Liberal Democrats 
deeply regret and condemn the statement issued by David Ward and his use
 of language which is unacceptable.’

Holocaust Memorial Day marks the 68th
 anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, 
where more than one million people, mostly Jews, were killed – many 
shot, starved or victims of the gas chambers. Homosexuals, political 
dissidents and the handicapped were also victims.

The MP, who said he had attended a 
Holocaust memorial event in Bradford yesterday which was ‘extremely 
moving’ said he hoped the chief whip would respect his views.

In an interview yesterday he said: 
‘What better day to raise the issue of learning from one of the worst 
examples of inhumanity.’ He told The Commentator website: ‘It appears 
that the suffering by the Jews has not transformed their views on how 
others should be treated.’

On his website, Mr Ward said he had 
‘signed a Book of Commitment in the House of Commons, in doing so 
pledging his commitment to Holocaust Memorial Day’ and describes 
Auschwitz as ‘the Nazi concentration and extermination camp which is the
 site of the largest mass murder in history.’

Karen Pollock, chief executive of the 
Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ‘I am deeply saddened that at this 
sombre time, when we remember those who were murdered by the Nazis, Mr 
Ward has deliberately abused the memory of the Holocaust causing deep 
pain and offence - these comments are sickening and unacceptable and 
have no place in British politics.’

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is understood to be furious with Mr Ward and condemned his remarks

Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ‘We are outraged and shocked at these offensive comments about Jewish victims of the Holocaust and the suggestion that Jews should have learned a lesson from the experience.

‘For an MP to have made such comments on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day is even more distasteful, and we welcome the fact that the Liberal Democrats have sought to disassociate the party from David Ward's comments.’

Tory MP Robert Halfon said his comments were ‘a tragic trivialisation of real evil.’ He said ‘It should be remembered that Israel withdrew from Gaza completely and yet has faced a barrage of 7000+ missiles from Hamas and been the victim of hundreds of terrorist suicide bombers and been attacked by all its neighbours in 1948, 1967 and 1973.’

Mr Ward has previously described Israel as an ‘apartheid regime’.  Liberal Democrat Baroness Jenny Tonge has twice been fired from the frontbench for her anti-Israel comments.

In 2004, she claimed she might become a suicide bomber if she lived in the West Bank or Gaza, and was sacked as the party’s spokesman on children’s issues.

She was sacked as health spokesman in 2010 for accusing Israeli soldiers of harvesting body parts in Haiti while doing humanitarian work after the earthquake, and this year said ‘Israel is not going to be there forever.’
