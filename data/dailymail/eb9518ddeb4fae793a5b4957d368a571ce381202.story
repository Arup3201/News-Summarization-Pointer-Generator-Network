A decade on from the 2004 tsunami, this collection of personal possessions offers a tragic reminder of the 230,000 people killed when 30m-high waves barreled through Indian Ocean coastal communities.

As the tenth anniversary of a disaster which devastated large parts of Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India approaches, Thai police have allowed the contents of hundreds of individual bags of possessions to be photographed.

Each picture, representing the possessions found on a single victim of the tragedy, provides a poignant snapshot of the lives of the 5,300 people killed on Thai beaches.

Since 2011, hundreds of these bags have been kept in a 12m by 3m shipping container by police in Phang Nga, Thailand.

Included are the common and everyday items - such as watches, jewellery and cellphones - victims were carrying when the disaster struck.

And as the anniversary approaches, seismologists are reflecting on the lessons learnt and improvements made, and look to obstacles ahead.

On December 26, 2004, the region lacked a co-ordinated Indian Ocean tsunami warning system, and awareness of tsunamis among the general public was low.

Now, education, communication and infrastructure have improved to better deal with such a disaster.

An earthquake is 'an emerging rupture of crust', says Daniel Jaksa, co-director of the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre.

'In this case, it started south of Banda Aceh and finished just near the area of Myanmar,' he says.

About 230,000 people were killed by the tsunami, with coastlines in 12 countries devastated, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Maldives, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Somalia, Tanzania, Seychelles, Bangladesh and Kenya.

The extensive rupture produced the equivalent of two million atomic blasts of energy being released over 10 minutes across 1200km of the tectonic plate boundary, Mr Jaksa said.

Many of those killed in the devastating tsunami were carrying very little when the waves hit. This person had only a bracelet and rings

This victim was carrying a red coin purse when the waves hit. They were also wearing a watch, several items of jewellery, and a religious trinket

A watch and a light-green bracelet were found with a piece of paper and necklace on the body of this person killed by the 2004 tsunami

Such a consequence does not bode well for people living on coasts near where one tectonic plate slides under another, which is the typical point where tsunamis are generated.

'If an earthquake occurs under your feet and you're on the coast, then a tsunami's upon you in very short time frames - 10 to 15 minutes,' Mr Jaksa, of Geoscience Australia, says.

'That's how long it takes for us to analyse an earthquake and issue a tsunami warning.'

Although earthquakes are unpredictable, he says people away from the epicentre have time to receive a warning and act.

'People who feel an earthquake on the coast shouldn't be hanging around on the coast. They should be going inland and uphill ... as quickly as possible. That means run. Don't drive a car,' he said.

On December 26, 2004, the region lacked a co-ordinated Indian Ocean tsunami warning system, and awareness of tsunamis among the general public was low. Pictured is a watch, a ring, an earring and a wallet found on one of the victims

A watch and a necklace, broken into three pieces, are the only items this person possessed when found

All that was discovered on the body of this person was a roll of USD $100 bills (pictured)

A second bag of cash was found, this time consisting of several hundred Thai Baht, the local currency. The only other item the person was carrying was a set of keys

Each bag holds the possessions of a single victim, all of which are kept in a large shipping container by Thai police. Pictured is a cellphone, a SIM card, some items of jewellery and a red bag

This bag contained only a silver watch and a beautifully decorated piece of gold jewellery

This victim appears to have been snorkeling at the time the tsunami hit - they were found carrying only a bracelet and a snorkel mask

This victim was asthmatic - they were carrying an inhaler, a set of keys, a lighters and two pieces of jewellery
