A council has been slammed after a single bus lane camera made more than £250,000 in just ten months.

Between March and December last year, a staggering 6,259 tickets were handed to motorists who were filmed straying into the lane - an average of around 20 per day.

The camera, on Kirkstall Road in Leeds, West Yorkshire, generated £250,850 in fines, dwarfing the average income of £38,000 from the city's other bus lane cameras.

This bus lane camera (top left) in Leeds raked in more than £250,000 in ten months. Locals are accusing the council of running a 'money-making racket'

This has attracted claims the camera is being used as a cash cow to boost council coffers.

Earnest Carter, an attendant at a nearby petrol station, said: 'It's just a money-making racket. People know they should not go in the lane and they don't go in it unless they have to.'

Motorists face a £30 fine for using the bus lane, rising to £60 if they fail to pay within 14 days.

Figures show the camera generated £12,514 in its first month. Fines peaked at £52,060 in April before declining steadily to £6,270 in November. The figure  rose again to £11,910 in December.

The camera, positioned to the left of the bus lane, catches out motorists on Kirkstall Road in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Motorists say the camera is 'unfairly positioned'

A spokesman for the Automobile Association said: 'It looks like the council  gave lots of Christmas shoppers a nice little memento of their journey into Leeds.'

He said fines were acceptable for inconsiderate drivers but there needed to be 'discretion' shown towards motorists who strayed into the lane, especially to allow emergency vehicles past.

Local businessman Ian Kerry, who uncovered the figures following a Freedom of Information request, said the camera was unfairly positioned.

'It's situated too close to the end of the bus lane and films those who drift into the lane to make a permitted left turn,' he said.

'The focus is set directly in front of the camera itself so it captures people cutting the last few yards of the bus lane to make the turn.'

The 41-year-old property consultant was given a penalty charge notice after straying into the lane on August 6 last year.

Mr Kerry was set to argue he should not be forced to pay because he was in the lane for less than 20 metres - a distance he said was permissible under the rules set out by other councils.

He wrote to the council asking for more information - but was told his appeal had been rejected before he had even made his case.

However, after taking the matter to a traffic penalty tribunal, his ticket was overturned.

The adjudicator in the case slammed the council for rejecting Mr Kerry's appeal.

A written judgement said the council had 'paid no regard at all to the possibility that he might wish to raise mitigation' in his defence.

It added: 'The council are obliged, of course, to consider not only if there was a contravention but, if and only if there was, what other information might mitigate it.

'Rejection only because there was a contravention is the wrong approach to their duty under the regulations.'

Figures show 136 of the 6,259 tickets issued in relation to the same camera last year were cancelled as the result of appeals.

Mr Kerry said: 'There's clearly a rush on the part of the council to get their hands on the money as soon as possible. I'm virtually certain that there are many other people who would have legitimate grounds to appeal.'

A Leeds City Council spokesman said: 'The bus lanes throughout Leeds are part of the city's commitment to reduce congestion and improve public transport links.

'We closely monitor the impact of bus lane enforcement in different locations to make sure the measures we have taken are delivering the best possible outcomes for road users.'

He added that the decline in fines being issued showed drivers were getting the message.
