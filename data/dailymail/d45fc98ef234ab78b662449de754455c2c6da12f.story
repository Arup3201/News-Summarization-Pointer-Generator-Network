A mysterious golden eagle with bells on its feet has been spotted by a group of cyclists in Wales.

The huge bird, which is exceptionally rare in the UK, appeared tame and even allowed some of the group touch it.

Experts insist the creature must have escaped from a sanctuary, but police in the area say they have not received reports from any sanctuaries or bird parks.

Cyclists spotted a golden eagle perched near the cycle path on the Llanllwni Mountain in Carmarthenshire, Wales

The bird allowed mountain biker Jason Mulvey to touch and stroke it

The cyclists were cycling along a trail in the Llanllwni Mountain in Carmarthenshire when they came across the eagle.

Mountain cyclists Nikki Channon and her husband Jason Mulvey said the massive bird was not distressed by group's presence and even let them stroke it.

She added: 'It is obviously tame and lost but could cause damage or take local lambs if it gets very hungry.

'It is also huge and so could easily frighten the public - it allowed us to come very close.

'No doubt someone is very anxious to have lost this bird.'

Cyclists Nikki Channon and husband Jason Mulvey said they are sure someone must be missing the bird

Golden eagles are now extremely rare in Britain and usually keep to remote mountains and hills

The cyclists are worried the lost bird may attack farm animals in the area if it is not returned to its owner

A spokesman for the RSPB said the birds were once common across Britain's mountains and hills, but are now mostly found at bird parks and zoos.

He added: 'This bird is likely to be an escapee rather than a wild golden eagle.

'They are commonly kept as falconerâ€™s birds or in bird of prey centres so this one is likely to have got away from its owner.'

The spokesman added that golden eagles were once found in upland areas in many parts of the UK.

'However, persecution pushed these birds to extinction in England and Wales by 1850.

'They are now almost entirely restricted to Scotland. Sadly, the persecution of golden eagles and other birds of prey continues to this day.'

Dyfed Powys Police say they have received no reports of a missing eagle meaning the bird's owner remains a mystery

The estimated 440 pairs of eagles living in the UK are thought to be confined to Scotland are extremely rare in Wales
