Investigators have told the mother of a toddler killed in a gas explosion her lit cigarette didn't set off the blast.

Two-year-old Jamie Heaton died instantly when an explosion tore through the family's home in Shaw, Greater Manchester last week, while mother Michelle was smoking outside.

Mrs Heaton, 31, has admitted she has been wracked with guilt since the tragedy, fearing she was responsible.

Police are still investigating the cause, but have reassured the mother-of-three her cigarette couldn't have sparked the blast.

But it's little comfort for the 
grief-stricken shop worker, who left her son watching Peppa Pig on TV 
while she stepped outside for a smoke break.

She told The Sun: 'I knew Jamie was occupied 
and wouldn't be causing mischief so I got my fags and went out onto the 
back step, closing the door behind me. I lit a fag, had a few puffs and 
then there was a 'boom'.

'I feel so guilty for going outside 
that day. I know that if I had been in the room with him it would have 
been that quick that I wouldn't have been able to do anything. But that 
doesn't stop me wishing I could have done something.

'I am just thankful I survived so that my other kids still have a mum.'

After she heard the blast, Mrs Heaton raced back into the house to search for her son.

Police
quickly arrived on the scene and ushered the frantic mother to a nearby
pub, where she met husband Kenny, 36, who was at work at the time of the explosion.

The pair waited for four hours while police sifted through rubble, before they were given the tragic news Jamie had died.

The couple take comfort in the fact their son died instantly and wouldn't have suffered.

In a statement released in the aftermath of the explision, they revealed they have been able to spend 'quality time' at hospital with Jamie's body.

They described Jamie as a 'happy little boy, mischievous and full of laughter (who) adored his family, his brother
and sister Jack and Jodie, they loved their cuddles and play fighting'.

Police have arrested a 32-year-old gas fitter who is believed to have examined a boiler in one of the affected houses in the days before the disaster.

The unnamed man has been bailed to appear in court on August 9.

Officers are still waiting to speak to the couple's next-door neighbour Anthony Partington, 27, who suffered 80 per cent burns when the blast happened at his home.

Police have confirmed he was under sedation in Wythenshawe hospital and will be questioned when he regains consciousness.

Steve Heywood, Assistant Chief 
Constable of Greater Manchester Police, told a press conference there 
had been no change in Mr Partington's condition and might not be 'for 
days or even weeks'.

The
landlord of the rented property has revealed it had a new, 
safety-certified boiler, and checks by gas engineers have yet to 
identify any faults in the area.

But
is thought the boiler developed a fault last week and say it may have 
caused a gas leak which could have ignited when Mr Partington lit a 
cigarette.

Police are also thought to be probing
claims that Mr Partington had sent a text message threatening to hang 
himself after his partner, Tanya Williams, also 27, walked out on him 
the night before the explosion, taking her five children - who were said
to be wearing just their pyjamas - with her..

Last
week the 27-year-old’s family claimed she had fled after suffering 
months of drink-fuelled violence but insisted nothing Mr Partington had 
said suggested he had set off the blast deliberately.

According
to Miss Williams’s family, she had sneaked out along with her five 
children earlier in the evening, later sending him a text message to say
what she had done.

Mr Partington is currently under 
police guard at a burns unit, but officers yesterday said they had 
‘significant questions’ to put to him. They have also interviewed Miss 
Williams over exactly what happened the night before.

Neighbours
described Miss Williams as having a strong personality and said she was
a doting mother to her five children aged between eight and six weeks. 
She and Mr Partington had been together for five years.

The massive explosion flattened number 
11 Buckley Street, where Jamie lived, and number 9, where Mr Partington 
lived. The two houses are separated by an alleyway.

Surrounding properties were also devastated and structural engineers will have to check each house before residents can return.

Charlie
Parker, chief executive of Oldham Council, said there were a number of 
properties in the immediate blast area which would have to be 
demolished.

Ten were seriously affected and 
others within the 'inner cordon' would have to be assessed for 
structural damage, Mr Parker added.

He said the council had been 
'swamped' by contributions for the victims of the blast and appealed for
people to make donations instead.

He
said some residents living on the periphery of the blast area should be
able to return to their homes and have their utilities reconnected 'in 
the next short period'.

A
statement from the council said: ‘Oldham Council is making arrangements
to enable some residents affected by the Shaw explosion to access their
properties.

‘Today we are 
urging residents from Gordon Street, Oak Street, Edmund Street and 
Chancery Lane to contact us as soon as possible.

‘If
you have not already done so, you should get in touch with Oldham 
Council either by going to the Rest Centre at Crompton House school or 
calling us direct on 0161 770 7770.

‘If
you live in any of these streets, we urgently need your contact details
so that we can speak to you directly about access to your property.
