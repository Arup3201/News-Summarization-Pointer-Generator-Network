Matt Tribe had just purchased his Never Ending Pasta Pass from Olive Garden when a wave of regret washed over him like Alfredo sauce drowning a bowl of fettuccine.

'I started wondering if I had made a mistake because I didn't know how I was going to eat enough pasta to justify buying the $100 pass,' according to the Ogden man.

That's when he hit upon the idea for seven weeks of Random Acts of Pasta, where he would use his unlimited supply of Olive Garden to give away free dinners throughout Salt Lake City.

Delivery: Matt Tribe of Ogden hit upon the idea to give away dinners when he realized he couldn't eat enough pasta by himself to justify the cost of his Never Ending Pasta Pass

A video of the stunt, in which Tribe hands out  pasta dinners to homeless residents of Salt Lake City, has gone viral, leading some to believe it was a cynical marketing ploy by the restaurant chain.

Olive Garden tweeted Saturday, denying any involvement with Tribe's video.

'To set things straight—our only role was selling Matt a Pasta Pass & fulfilling his orders,' the company stated to several users from its Twitter account.

According to the site documenting Tribe's efforts, the first recipient was his sister, Mandy, who was gifted a fettuccine Alfredo with salad and breadsticks.

From there, he says he dropped off dinners to friends, chased down his mailman and two UPS men with pasta, and treated a couple named Ben and Jessica to a meal.

When he showed up to his niece's first birthday pasta in hand, Tribe says his sister 'decided that it was tacky that I brought Olive Garden to the party and so she hid it under the table.'

Denial: Olive Garden tried to come to the defense of a disheartened Tribe, who had been accused on sites like Reddit of being a corporate carbo shill

Tribe - who admits he ate 14 meals himself, sometimes after not finding anyone to deliver them to - says he delivered ten of the 100 meals from Random Acts of Pasta to homeless residents in Salt Lake City.

He said he was touched  when one woman said she was planning on sharing her meal with friends and went on a pasta run to bring them more meals.

On his last day, Tribe committed to seeing how many Olive Gardens he could visit in a single night, which brought him to five locations for seven meals.

After that, he passed off the responsibility of the Pasta Pass to his sister, who gave out an extra 25 meals during the last two weeks.

In the end, Tribe says, the best Olive Garden was in Riverdale, while the worst was a location in downtown Salt Lake City, where he was IDed for his meal and watched a manager yell at the staff.

Still he calls his act of carbo benevolence 'one of the most fun and fulfilling things I've ever done.'

'Perhaps it's because I live a very boring and uneventful life and doing anything is be better than the alternative, or perhaps it's because that during the time I was doing Random Acts of Pasta, the only thing on my mind was who I was going to take pasta to.'
