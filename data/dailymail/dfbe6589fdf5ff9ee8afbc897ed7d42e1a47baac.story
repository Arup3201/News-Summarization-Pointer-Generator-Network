'Family Guy' is taking on a New Jersey political scandal.

A flier sent to Emmy voters asks them to name the show 'best animated program.' It warns, 'Vote for us, or it's time for some traffic problems in Brentwood,' a Los Angeles neighborhood where many Emmy voters live.

The warning is a reference to lane closures last year at the heart of the scandal and a now-infamous email about them. Bridget Anne Kelly, a since-fired aide to Gov. Chris Christie, wrote before the closures, 'It's time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' referencing the New Jersey town that saw days of traffic jams. Federal prosecutors are investigating.

'Vote for us, or it's time for some traffic problems in Brentwood': Family Guy's Emmy flier pokes fun at the Bridgegate scandal

On the flier, character Peter Griffin wears a tie and looks almost governor-like.

The traffic cones Griffin holds seem to be a reference to comments Christie made in December 2013 and reported by NJ.com when he joked in a conference 'I worked the cones. Unbeknownst to anyone, I was working the cones,' when asked about his role in Bridgegate.

As noted by Deadline, the campaign is similar to the show's provocative 2010 mailer, which depicted Griffin as the main character from 'Precious,' with the slogan 'Vote for us or you're racist.'
