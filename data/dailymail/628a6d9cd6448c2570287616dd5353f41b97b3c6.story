Katie Hill discovered she had a 2.5stone cyst while pregnant

A 'miracle' baby has survived despite his mother suffering from a two stone cyst while pregnant with him.

Doctors feared the huge growth could be cancerous and warned Katie Hill it would kill her and her unborn son Alfie if it burst.

She had her partner Ricky Collier had been trying for a baby for 18 months and were delighted when they discovered Ms Hill was pregnant last July.Â 

But a few weeks after the 12 week scan last September she experienced sharp, cramping pains down her left side.

Doctors discovered a small cyst and drained four litres of fluid from it, but just after her 20 week scan, Ms Hill was recalled to hospital and told a huge second cyst had been found.

She said: 'My consultant told me that there was debris inside this cyst and it could be cancerous, so they would have to operate to remove it.

'They told me they were going to leave me until I was 25 weeks pregnant before they operated to give the baby the best chance of survival.

'By this point I was in so much pain with the cyst because it was so heavy and they put me on painkillers.

'They told me it was if I was carrying twins at 30 weeks, as the cyst had made me so much bigger than I should be at that stage of pregnancy.

'However, it was only after they operated that we found out it was a lot worse than that.

'I was absolutely huge and if the cyst had burst or ruptured, both me and the baby would have died.'

Ms Hill, 25, was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital in December as she struggled to breathe and had a temperature.

She was losing blood internally, given an emergency transfusion and booked in for the emergency operation to remove the cyst.

Ms Hill underwent a three-and-a-half hour operation to drain 12 litres of fluid from it and, to her relief, no cancer was found.

The cyst had not been a common ovarian one but developed inside her left fallopian tube, which had expanded massively as it had grown.

Ms Hill had regular scans to check on her baby as doctors feared that being so squashed by the cyst might have affected his growth but he seemed fine.

Baby Alfie survived the surgery as he wriggled lower into his mother's womb

Ms Hill added: 'Once they removed the cyst, they removed my left fallopian tube as well.

'The doctors told me: 'We don't know how you survived. Thankfully, there was no cancer.'

Ms Hill then continued with her pregnancy and three months after the operation, her son Alfie was born slightly prematurely, but otherwise well.

A month on, he is now doing well at home in Preston, Lancashire.

Ms Hill, a clerical officer for the NHS, said: 'Alfie is an absolute joy and we cannot believe he is here after everything we have been through.

'It is frightening to think that if the cyst had ruptured, both Alfie and I could have died.

'We experienced some very frightening times but now Alfie is here, we are both so happy, as he is just so perfect.'

Alfie survived the surgery as he wriggled lower into her womb and Ms Hill returned home after a few days in hospital.

The couple faced further anguish after 30 weeks of pregnancy when a scan showed enlarged ventricles to the baby's brain.

Ms Hill was referred to specialists in Manchester who offered to test for Down's syndrome.

She said: 'We felt there was no point having the test, as it was not an issue. Alfie was going to come anyway.'

Ms Hill went into hospital on March 24 to be induced, but doctors told her she had already started labour and she had to be sent for an emergency Caesarean section.

When she came round her first words were: 'Is my baby alive?' and she was told that Alfie was in intensive care.

She said: 'Once I came round, they took me up in my bed to see Alfie. He was all wired up and in an incubator.'

After having the cyst removed, Ms Hill (with partner Ricky) went on to have baby Alfie slightly prematurely

Alfie, who was born on March 25 weighing 7lb 7oz, began gradually getting better, and after seven days in hospital he and his mother were allowed home.

She said: 'Alfie is now a month old and is doing really well.

'He's a perfect miracle and we are just amazed that he is here. We just keep looking at him and crying.'

His father added: 'Alfie is perfect. We just can't stop looking at him and checking on him.'

Sanjeev Prashar, clinical director of women's health at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'A cyst that weighs more than two stone is certainly quite unusual and removing a large cyst during pregnancy can be a difficult operation.

'We wish Katie, Alfie and the family well for the future.'
