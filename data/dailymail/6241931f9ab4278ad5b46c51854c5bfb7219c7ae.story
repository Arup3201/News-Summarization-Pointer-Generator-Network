All Hallows' Eve is just around the corner and though you may not know it, some of the most spine-tingling attractions in the world are right outside your door.

From the family-friendly to the thoroughly frightening, our list of activities will satisfy thrill-seekers of all ages leading up to October 31.

Since Halloween falls on a Friday, there is plenty of time to plan a thoroughly spooktacular weekend. Here, we've selected the very best events from around the UK.

Lord Voldemort's 20-foot snake is on display at the Dark Arts feature at the Warner Bros Studio Tour in London

Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter (Greater London)

Just in time for Halloween, the new Dark Arts feature at the Warner Bros Studio Tour has arrived. Stop by after October 14 to experience the eerie new installation, complete with horcruxes and other sinister wizarding artefacts.

Best of all? You can even get up close and personal with Lord Voldemort's 20-foot snake, Nagini, which sits atop the Malfoy Manner table. Adult tickets are £31 and admission to the new Dark Arts section is included from October 17 to November 3. 

Chessington World of Adventures Resort  Howl’o’ween (Greater London)

From October 27 through November 2, head to the Chessington World of Adventures Resort for their Howl’o’ween extravaganza.

Experience rides, zoo animals and the sea life centre in the dark or step back in time to 1897 Transylvania and opt for an interactive vampire-themed walk-through. Early bird tickets are available now, starting at £25. 

For family-friendly frights, head to Legoland Windsor to venture through the Forest of 5,000 Pumpkins

Book now! The Nottingham Ghost Walk is one of the most famous supernatural tours in Britain

Legoland Windsor's Brick or Treat (Greater London)

Get a jump on the spooktacular activities with Legoland Windsor’s family-friendly Brick or Treat events. Venture through the Forest of 5,000 Pumpkins – where you can build your own, of course – and then stop by the Monster Ball to show off your best dance moves.

A spooky puppet show and daily fancy dress competition will top off your ghoulishly fun day out. Prices are £41.40 for children and seniors and £46.80 for adults at the door. 

Nottingham Ghost Walk (Nottingham)

Now in its 21st year, the Nottingham Ghost Walk is a must. Developed by psychic medium Jenny Cross, the walk takes visitors past Nottingham Castle, into a graveyard, through the Galleries of Justice and even into ancient sandstone caves.

The tours run year round, but booking is highly recommended close to Halloween. Tickets are £6. 

Fyvie Castle (Fyvie, Aberdeenshire)

For a historical day of spooky storytelling, look no further than to Fyvie Castle in Turriff – just 26 miles from Aberdeen. On Sunday, October 26, the National Trust of Scotland is inviting everyone out for frighteningly fun tours and storytelling with Vladd the Butler.

Dating back to the 13th century, the castle is widely believed to be haunted, but these supernatural tales are aimed at children aged 5-12. 

The Chessington World of Adventures Resort's Howl'o'ween event begins October 27

For those who enjoy some hooch with their horror, Dungeon Lates is the Halloween event for you

Dungeon Lates (London) 

Following the Halloween rush, The London Dungeon is offering up several more Fridays of after-hour scares, starting on November 7. Beginning at 6:15pm and for just £40, you can get in on the creepy, cocktail-filled fun.

In the price of admission, spook-seekers will receive a gin cocktail, access to the dress-up box, an hour-long tour and other surprise tipples along the way. Dungeon LATES is for over 18s only.

The Real Mary King’s Close (Edinburgh)

Buried deep beneath Edinburgh's Royal Mile, the Real Mary King's Close is one of the most haunted - and most fascinating - areas of the Old Town. Shrouded in myths and mysteries, costumed guides will lead you through the alleyways, all while sharing tales of ghosts and murders, and the truth behind myths of plague victims being walled up and left to die. 

On October 31, a late-night, interactive 'Dark Truth Tour' will run four times throughout the evening with adult tickets priced at £14.

Scare Kingdom's seasonal Scream Park returns for its sixth year with several brand new attractions

Open on selected nights between October 5 and November 8 inclusive, tickets start at £14.50 and advanced booking is essential.   

Creepy Cardiff Ghost Tour (Cardiff, Wales)

The Welsh capital offers this ghostly walking tour that is not to be missed. Beginning outside the National Museum of Wales, the hour long tour winds its way through the city, while guides tell stories of hauntings, reincarnations and the resting place of Queen Boadicea.

The Halloween special takes place on October 31 at 7pm and pre-booking is necessary. Tickets are £5 per person. 

Not for the faint of heart: Oxford Castle's Ghost Fest offers a haunted house experience with no boundaries
