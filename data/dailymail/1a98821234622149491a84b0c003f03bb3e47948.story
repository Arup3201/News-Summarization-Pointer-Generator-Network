 

Frightened toddlers were locked alone in a classroom storage closet by teachers as part of a lesson on ‘how to survive’, it has been claimed.

Security video allegedly shows day-care teacher Shandra Fallen and her assistant Amellia Samuda leading two-year-olds into a closet at Pinocchio Children’s Palace in Brooklyn, New York.

The teachers were found out  when the owner of the unit, Tatiana Ilyaich,  heard sobbing coming from the classroom, in June.

When she investigated she saw a terrified youngster inside the closet - before the teachers ‘started laughing’.

After scouring video footage for similar incidents, she informed parents, alerted the authorities and then sacked the duo the following business day.

According to the New York Post, the Administration for Children’s Services and the city Health Department investigated the matter.

The owner of the unit, Tatiana Ilyaich, said she discovered the activity in June after she heard sobbing coming from the classroom. An image of the interior of the day centre is pictured above

When Ms Fallen, 25, was applying for unemployment, she allegedly told Labor Department officials that it was a ‘kind of a game, that they were teaching [the children] how to survive if they are by themselves,’ Tatiana Ilyaich told the newspaper.

The report says footage taken in May at the day care in East Flatbush showed Ms Fallen shutting one child into the supply closet and leaving him for three minutes before allowing him out.

A two-year-old is then seen being ushered into the room and left for seven minutes. At that point Ms Fallen enters the closet and comes out after a minute leaving the child inside, the report says.

Ms Samuda does the same shortly afterwards, it is claimed, and in total the youngster stays in the closet for ten minutes, according to the newspaper.

The child’s mother is understood to be suing Pinocchio, Ms Fallen and Ms Samuda at Brooklyn Supreme Court.

It adds that neither Brooklyn’s DA nor the NYPD had a record of the case. 

The pair are believed to have started work at the centre in November and the owner said there had been no prior problems with either of them.

The New York Post quotes Ms Fallen’s lawyer as denying all wrongdoing and that they had not seen the lawsuit.

It says Ms Samuda, 34, did not return messages for a comment adding that the Health Department insisted it had ‘properly screened’ the pair.
