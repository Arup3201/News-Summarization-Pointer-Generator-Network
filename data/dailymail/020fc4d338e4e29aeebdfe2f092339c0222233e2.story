At first glance, these photographs may look like any other dance hall.

Then you notice that many of the dancers are wrapped up for the cold.

In central Kiev, pensioners meet up in a subway near the Teatralna metro station every Saturday to see friends and dance the night away.

They are allowed to use the public passage by authorities in the Ukrainian capital because they cannot afford to pay for a venue.

The gathering for pensioners has taken place every Saturday for about 20 years in an underpass near a city centre metro station

For the gathering's attendees, it is one of the few opportunities they have to meet and socialise

The underground gatherings have been 
documented by Reuters photographer Gleb Garanich, who says he first 
encountered the 'subway disco' about 20 years ago, but did not take much
notice.

Now, he has returned with his camera to tell their story - and one couple in particular caught his eye.

Nikolai Milevsky, born in 1938, and Natalya Stolyarchuk, born in 1955, met at the dances and have since moved in together - one of about twenty couples who have formed out of the gatherings.

Garanich went to their home, which they have shared for four years, and photographed them getting ready for their weekly appointment with the makeshift ballroom.

The couple are seen sprucing themselves up before sharing a tender kiss and leaving for their night out.

Despite their ages, the pair are still working.

Their joint monthly income from their pensions is only 4,000 hryvnias - the equivalent of about £327.

He wrote in a blogpost: 'The
reason they dance is also well understood – this is probably the most 
affordable way to while away their spare time and communicate.

'Yet
the main problem of the elderly generation in this country is that they
feel unneeded by the state and people that surround them.

'This
generation grew up in the Soviet Union. Many cannot adjust to a 
completely different lifestyle or reconcile with new realities and 
values.

'They don’t understand communication via social networks, but they still clearly remember the way all holidays were celebrated during their childhood and youth; when tables laden with food were brought out, and neighbors from the same street or house would sit down together and then dance to the tune of an accordion through the night.

Garanich's time at the subway has led him to dwell on why the gatherings mean so much to the dancers.

He wrote: 'These dances are recollections about their youth and about that time.

'It’s an opportunity to return there – if only in their thoughts, only for a few hours.

Despite the cold, the dances still attract a healthy turnout because it is an affordable way to socialise

'I have noticed that many of them 
never smile, and even dances cannot draw them away from gnawing problems
such as the misunderstanding of their own children, poor health, the 
death of their loved ones, abject poverty and despair.

'The same dances, however, literally 
transform others. It suddenly seems that they look younger, with kingly 
bearings and glittering eyes.

'For many of them, these meetings are a
rare chance of lively communication and an escape from loneliness after
the loss of close friends.'
