Jimmy Bullard has sent a warning shot to his fellow I'm a Celebrity contestants, insisting if anyone 'p****s' him off in the jungle the former footballer will have no hesitation retaliating.

The 36-year-old was announced as a surprise inclusion in the ITV reality show earlier this week and touched down in Australia on Monday.

And former Wigan and Fulham midfielder Bullard was pulling no punches when he was interviewed by ITV ahead of the programme's launch on Sunday.

'If someone p****s me off I will find a way of letting them know "what you've done there, you've p****d me right off, mate and I'll have to give you some back basically,"' Bullard said. 

'The reputation as a football player that I seem to get tarnished with all the time is the joker.'

'I definitely think that I'll be playing pranks on people once I'm in the jungle.'

Reaction to Duncan Ferguson's punch 

Duncan Ferguson losing the plot is enough to unsettle even the bravest of people and when the former Everton striker was about to be sent off for punching a Wigan player, Bullard reacted with humour and terror in equal measure.

Posing for the Hull team line-up shot

While taking part in filming the Hull team line-up, Bullard performed a series of hilarious poses, including pulling his shorts up as high as possible, before just about managing to keep a straight face for the real shot.

Leaping over a penalty box melee

During a match between Wigan and Everton, an almighty goal-mouth scramble involving a pile-up of seven players ended with Bullard leap-frogging over one of the Everton defenders and clearing the entire melee.

That goal celebration 

When Manchester City hammered Hull 5-1 manager Phil Brown decided to conduct his half-time team talk on the pitch. And when Bullard scored from the spot against Manchester City the next time the teams met, the midfielder re-enacted the famous incident with him playing the role of Phil Brown.

The laundry bin

Bullard was filmed by a team-mate as he was pushed around the Wigan dressing room in a laundry bin. The midfielder was completely starkers apart from the pair of underpants he had on his head.
