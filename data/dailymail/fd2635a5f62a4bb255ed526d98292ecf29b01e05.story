Thousands have gathered in North Korea to commemorate the 61st anniversary of the signing of the armistice that ended the Korean War and split the country in two.

While the two Koreas technically remain at war, the North celebrates the armistice as Victory in the Fatherland Liberation War, a major national holiday.

High-scale parade that have been seen in previous years did not take place at Sunday's event, with a presentation and some entertainment instead

The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, when the communist government north of the Korean Peninsula's 38th parallel invaded South Korea.

It ended on July 27, 1953, upon the signing of an armistice agreement that left the demilitarized zone separating the two countries.

The day before the anniversary, North Korea fired a short-range ballistic missile into waters off its east coast.

The missile, fired from North Korea's southwest Hwanghae province on Saturday evening, flew about 310 miles across the country before landing in the sea, South Korean officials said.

North Korea routinely test-fires missiles, artillery and rockets, but the number of weapons tests it has conducted this year is much higher than previous years.

Photos have since emerged of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un studying a firing drill directed at US military bases in South Korea.

Jong-un did not make an appearance at the anniversary, instead paying his respects just after midnight at the mausoleum where his father and grandfather lie in state.

Veterans, now in their 70s and 80s, many wearing uniforms laden with medals and clutching bouquets of flowers, were celebrated in patriotic events around the country.

In Pyongyang's central plaza, Kim Il Sung Square, the aged veterans, some crying, told war stories.Â 

A mass chorus of schoolchildren sang odes to Kim Jong Un and a crowd of college students was exhorted to be "the new generation" in building North Korea under Kim's leadership.

To lighten the mood, they were also treated to a show of square dancing and taekwondo. After watching the official events, many people in Pyongyang took the advantage of a sunny day off to enjoy family outings along the capital's riverside promenades.

As part of the U.N. Allied Forces during the Korean War, 21 countries helped South Korea fight off invading troops from the communist North, with 16 of them sending combat troops and the five others providing medical assistance units.

Tens of thousands of U.N. troops were killed in action.

South and North Korea, which remain divided, are technically at war as the Korean War ended only with a ceasefire, not a peace treaty.

Estimates for the war dead vary between 
2.5 million and 4 million, and the border between the two Koreas remains
 one of the most heavily fortified in the world.
