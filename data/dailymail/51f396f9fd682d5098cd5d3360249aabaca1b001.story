Disgraced police chief Ali Dizaei yesterday lost his appeal against his convictions for framing an innocent man for assault.

The 50-year-old former Scotland Yard commander had tried to get his three-year prison sentence for corruption overturned by claiming he was the ‘victim of a sophisticated witch-hunt’.

But three judges at the Court of Appeal unanimously upheld a jury’s decision last year that Dizaei had framed an innocent man, Waad al-Baghdadi, in a row over money.

His disgraceful behaviour has been repeatedly exposed by the Mail which, since 2001, has chronicled how timid Scotland Yard chiefs appeased his appalling behaviour, endless threats of legal action and even strikes by fellow race militants.

At one stage, Dizaei was considered more powerful than the Metropolitan Police Commissioner - such was the stranglehold he held over his supposed superiors.

The swaggering playboy, who loved to play the race card to intimidate critics, has been tried and convicted twice over the charges.

Dizaei, dubbed a ‘criminal in uniform’, was first found guilty in February 2010 after a jury decided that he was lying when he claimed Mr al-Baghdadi had threatened him and assaulted him outside a west London restaurant in July 2008.

But he was freed from prison, where he was serving a four year sentence, in May 2011 after the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions because his victim had failed to tell the truth about his immigration status.

At a retrial at Southwark Crown Court last year the officer was once again found guilty of misconduct and perverting the course of justice.

He was then jailed for three years, but released on an electronic tag two weeks later because he had spent 15 months in prison as a result of his first conviction.

In the latest appeal, Dizaei’s lawyer, Stephen Riordan, QC, argued that the conviction was ‘unsafe’.

He said that the judge at the second trial had made an ‘error of law’ when he refused to admit certain ‘bad character’ evidence relating to Mr al-Baghdadi.

Mr Riordan argued that because of the judge’s decision to reject the application the jury ‘did not have all the material that it should have done’.

He told the court: ‘We submit simply that that decision was wrong - that the reasons he gave for refusing to allow this material to be deployed were matters which more properly should have been considered by the jury.’

Opposing the appeal, Peter Wright, QC, for the Crown, told the court: ‘Here there was no error by the judge in the exercise he undertook. The decision was not wrong in law.’

Mr Wright said: ‘We submit that in the context of the fairness of this trial, that this trial remained entirely fair and that the conviction was not unsafe.’ Dismissing the appeal, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, sitting with Mr Justice Wyn Williams and Mr Justice Globe, ruled that the conviction was ‘safe’.

Lord Judge added: ‘In truth there was formidable evidence against the appellant.’ Prior to being jailed for a second time, Dizaei was on full pay.

After winning a retrial but still to clear his name, he was reinstated, quickly suspended on full pay and then awarded up to £180,000 in back pay and allowances as he awaited the new hearing.

His salary was stopped on the day he was convicted again.

Dizaei, of Acton, west London, has emerged unscathed from a series of inquiries over the years which cost Scotland Yard around £4million.

One included an undercover operation examining claims of corruption, fraud, dishonesty and appalling threats to an ex-girlfriend.
