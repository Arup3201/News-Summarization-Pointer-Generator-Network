A man who groped an air hostess while drunk on a flight has been jailed for three months in Dubai.

Terry Harrison, of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, knocked back six shots of vodka on a flight from Bangkok, staff said.

The 40-year-old was reportedly annoying crew and passengers aboard the Emirates flight, and had tried to barge his way into first class on the flight, before he 'hit' the woman on the bottom.

Those aboard the overnight flight said the engineer was irritating women passengers by massaging their shoulders  - and allegedly spat at a fellow traveller.

He was found guilty by a court in Dubai of touching a stewardess's back and 'kissing her hand', the Sun reports.

The 28-year-old woman told the court: 'He was drunk and kind of hit me on my bottom.

'He'd done a few things throughout the flight and I think they just mounted up.

'It was the final straw. His behaviour throughout the flight was not acceptable. He spat at a passenger.'

The father-of-one was arrested when the plane landed in Dubai. He was also charged with breaching Islamic laws on alcohol despite the fact that he was served drinks by airline staff

The father-of-one was arrested when the plane landed in Dubai.

He was also charged with breaching Islamic laws on alcohol  - despite the fact that he was served drinks by airline staff.

The court ruled that as the plane was registered in Dubai, Harrison should have had a special licence, allowing him special dispensation to drink alcohol.

He denied molesting a flight attendant but admitted drinking alcohol without a licence - but he was convicted of both and jailed for three months and fined £320 by Judge Izzat Mansour.

An Emirates Spokesman said: 'We cannot comment on court judgments that we have not seen. However, many countries have laws prohibiting offensive behaviour on board aircraft and regularly prosecute unruly and disruptive passengers for such incidents.

'The international community is also currently taking steps to update the Tokyo Convention regarding disruptive passengers, due to the concerns of many governments about the escalation of the severity and frequency of unruly behaviour on board aircraft.

'Emirates provides complimentary beverages to passengers aged 21 years and over.'
