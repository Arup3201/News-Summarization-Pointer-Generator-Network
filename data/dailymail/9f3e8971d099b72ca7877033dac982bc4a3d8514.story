On the ground: The woman stands aggressively over her victim as a man stands and watches

The woman continues to harass her 44-year-old victim when she finally gets to her feet, while a group of people watch on without stepping in.

The incident, which happened in the middle of the day outside Shalil Food Store in Handsworth Wood, Birmingham, was sparked because the attacker's VW Touran was parked in the middle of the road, where no one could get past.

She was sitting in the passenger seat while the male driver had gone into a nearby shop, and the victim asked if she could move the car to let her through.

The victim asked how long they might be parked there, and was met with a tirade of abuse, before taking another route and parking near the shops.

But as she got out to go inside, she was violently attacked.

She suffered bruising and a lump to her head as a result.

WPC Geraldine Sprigg, from Birmingham West and Central, said: 'This was an unprovoked and violent attack on a woman who had asked the driver to move her car which was blocking the road.

'The assault took place in the middle of the day and we are asking for anyone who saw the incident or who recognises the woman driver to contact us. The woman assaulted suffered pain and discomfort following the attack and may have lost consciousness for a short time.' 

Anyone with information should call police at Birmingham West and Central on 101 or call Crimestoppers confidentially on 0800 555 111.
