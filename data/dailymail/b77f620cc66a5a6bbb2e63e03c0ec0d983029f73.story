Inhaling deeply, the BBC’s ex-royal correspondent tries cannabis as part of a TV experiment examining the effects of types of the drug on the brain.

Jennie Bond, who worked as the BBC's royal correspondent for 14 years, inhaled potent 'skunk' cannabis as part of a six-month scientific experiment for a new Channel 4 programme called Drugs Live: Cannabis on Trial

Yesterday critics and experts accused Channel 4 of turning Drugs Live: Cannabis On Trial into little more than a stunt designed to boost ratings and glamorise the Class B drug.

The programme sees 22 volunteers including Miss Bond, presenter Jon Snow and former Tory MP Matthew Parris take two sorts of cannabis – hash and high-strength skunk – plus a placebo.

Each has tests including a brain scan, while changes to their mood, memories and emotions are monitored.

Professor David Nutt, 63, who was sacked as the Government’s drugs tsar in 2009 for saying cannabis is less harmful than alcohol and nicotine, will appear as an expert, with University College London professor Val Curran.

Professor Nutt’s charity DrugScience contributed funding towards the Channel 4 trial.

Mary Brett, chairman of campaign group Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘Skunk is a dreadful drug and it is very irresponsible to have a show with such biased experts. It will be a platform for Professor Nutt to peddle what he thinks about drugs to an audience of young people.’

Julia Manning, chief executive of independent think-tank 2020 Health, said: ‘What I don’t think we should be doing is encouraging experimentation with substances when there is no doubt these substances have significant side-effects. This is not about science, it’s about viewing figures. The legislation we have seems to be deterring drug taking so why do we need to open the Pandora’s box and encourage more experimentation?

‘It’s glamorising and trivialising the issue.’

Snow, 67, who was given a brain scan after trying the drug, said: ‘I’ve worked in war zones, but I’ve never been as overwhelmingly frightened as I was when I was in the MRI scanner after taking skunk. I would never do it again.’

The scientific experiment, which has been approved by the Home Office, is being documented to try and demonstrate the effects potent 'skunk' cannabis has on the brain. Ms Bond said the drug made her feel 'floaty'

But critics were concerned the programme would not show the long-term impact of cannabis use.

Fay Watson, secretary general of Europe Against Drugs, said: ‘Placing someone into a MRI scanner when they are under the influence may be useful to assess the immediate impacts of cannabis, but it’s not going to demonstrate the long-term harms people are most concerned about.

‘Cannabis use is associated with a wide range of negative side-effects such as anxiety, psychotic episodes, depression, cancer, stroke, as well as IQ decline in young people.’

Cannabis, the most widely used illegal drug in Britain, has been linked to long-term mental health problems including schizophrenia, and is known to cause anxiety and paranoia. Users also find it difficult to concentrate.

Skunk is a potent form of cannabis that now dominates 80 per cent of the British market. Some believe it is far more addictive than other forms of cannabis and can provoke paranoid episodes, psychotic symptoms and memory loss.

Channel 4 said Professor Nutt, a Professor of Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, and Professor Curran ‘are two of the world’s leading experts on the effects of illegal drugs on the brain’.

A spokesman said the pair had ‘collaborated on this ethically approved six-month cannabis trial at UCL.

‘[They] will describe the chemicals in cannabis that are responsible for the effects seen in the brain. They will explain how they differ between the two forms of the drug, as well as looking at the risks and the potentially positive effects of cannabis.’

The spokesman added: 'It is absolutely not the case that the programme or scientific trial encourage people to take cannabis or glamorise it – they are giving people the facts.

'Anyone seeing the video of Jon Snow taking "skunk" in the trial will understand the potentially negative effects of the drug.' 

Mr Snow said that smoking the more potent cannabis 'outstripped anything' he had previously experienced

I've been asked to do some pretty strange things in my time. Being buried in a coffin full of rats is just one of them. But I'm always up for a challenge, so when I was asked to take part in a drugs trial for Channel 4, I decided it would be both interesting and informative.

The purpose of the trial was to show how skunk - the most common form of cannabis now sold on the streets - affects the brain and behaviour compared to weaker forms of cannabis.

I was to be one of a number of volunteers to undergo the trial at University College London under the guidance of one of the world's leading experts on the effects of illegal drugs on the brain, Professor Val Curran.

I smoked a bit of cannabis as a student at University. I enjoyed the mellowing effect, the relaxation and sometimes the uncontrollable giggling.

So the idea of taking skunk didn't frighten me and I was intrigued to see how it differed from the weaker cannabis I used to smoke.

I turned up for day one of the trial feeling nervous...mainly about how to inhale the stuff, as I gave up smoking more than thirty years ago. There was also the added twist of not knowing what I was taking. The trial was to be conducted over three separate days and I would be given skunk, low potency hash and a placebo. But I wasn't told - and still do not know - which I was given on each occasion.

The first thing to say is that it wasn't in the least like the old days... lying back on velvet cushions in a darkened room, smoking weed and listening to Jimi Hendrix! The laboratory conditions, the camera in your face and the prospect of inhaling what seemed like gallons of the stuff through a vaporiser and a huge plastic bag was far from relaxing.

It felt harsh in my throat and I had to inhale two whole bags of it. It smelled like cannabis and I felt a little dizzy. But, as I got used to the procedure, I felt no dramatic effects and decided this must be the placebo, which was rather disappointing.

The next part of the experiment was to undergo a full MRI scan of the brain. Luckily I'm not claustrophobic (especially after being buried in a coffin in 'I'm A Celebrity') and find medical procedures fascinating. So,spending an hour in the scanner didn't bother me at all. In fact it was rather restful.

During the scan I was asked to do a lengthy series of observation and memory tests. There was also a musical appreciation test, which struck me as rather odd but not too taxing.

I felt fine, not at all stoned and I rather enjoyed the whole experience. The scientists were very encouraging, but I have no idea how well I did.

I then had to inhale another huge bag of whatever it was and attempt another set of mental athletics. The tasks were straightforward enough: memorise a short report, select different coloured balls from jars you couldn't see, think of as many vegetables as possible.

I was rubbish.

I forgot almost the entire report, had no idea what I was doing with the balls and got fixated on vegetables beginning with the letter 'c' for some unknown reason.

So was I stoned or just stupid? I still don't know - but I fear the latter!

The second trial, a week, later, followed the same pattern. I felt I'd got better at inhaling and quite enjoyed the sweet smell. But, once again, I didn't feel particularly stoned. I suspected this was the cannabis of my University days.

I do remember getting quite absurdly confused over the coloured balls test and finding it rather funny. And I was shocked that my blood pressure, normally quite low, had shot up to 150. Whatever I had taken clearly wasn't doing my body much good.

When I arrived for my final trial, I was convinced I'd had the placebo and the cannabis...so this time it would be skunk. It seemed much harsher in my throat and I did feel quite stoned after the first two bags. It wasn't particularly pleasant; it made me rather dizzy but I also felt super relaxed.

In the MRI scanner, the tests seemed no more difficult than before, but I had one hell of a job staying awake.

After the third bag of whatever it was, I had an insatiable thirst and a love affair with a bunch of grapes!

My memory was appalling again, but I don't think my concentration was badly affected. Once again, my blood pressure went through the roof. That scared me and made me realise just how dangerous drugs can be.

I shall be intrigued to find out whether I was right about which substance I was given on each day. And it will be fascinating to see whether I was in fact a lot more stoned than I thought. It could be embarrassing!
