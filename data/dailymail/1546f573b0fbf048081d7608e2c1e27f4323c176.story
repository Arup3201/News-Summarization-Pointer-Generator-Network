Park House looks like an ordinary (albeit large) family home - and, more important, it feels like an ordinary family home.

It has been run as a hotel by one family since 1948, and so you might expect a little complacency to have crept in. On the contrary. Sitting just outside Midhurst in West Sussex, this is not so much a class act as a lesson in top-notch hospitality without a whiff of pretension.

You feel at ease, relaxed and gloriously comfortable.

Anyone for tennis? The Inspector found a slice of country-retreat splendour at Park House

We are talking old-fashioned smart, a reminder that pelmets and chintz have not entirely had their day.

The ladies' loo on the first floor is called The Powder Room. There are two grass tennis courts in summer.

A grand woman called Ione O'Brien, who lived to be 97, and her husband Michael used to run it; their grandson is now in charge.

At least, we think she must have been grand. In the bar - where you help yourself and jot down what you've had - there are framed photographs and letters, including a note from the Queen about her racehorses and a signed snap of Ronald Reagan.

Princess Margaret is up there, too, along with Patricia Routledge and Tom Conti. Our room has no fewer than three big sash windows and a fourth in the bathroom. It looks out over an immaculate six-hole pitch and putt course and the rolling South Downs National Park beyond. A spa has been added, with a terrific indoor pool and treatments galore, set discreetly away from the house.

Pool your resources: The hotel has been in the same family since 1948, but shows no sign of complacency

There's nothing old-fashioned about the food. The Scottish chef works his magic with fresh ingredients sourced locally.

Some people might want a livelier atmosphere in the dining room and at one point my wife finds the conversation at the next table more interesting than at ours. But that's my problem.

It's not bad value either. We're paying £249 for bed, three-course dinner and a delicious breakfast.

We arrive late on a Friday and leave early-ish the next morning, but still feel we've had a proper break in a proper hotel.
