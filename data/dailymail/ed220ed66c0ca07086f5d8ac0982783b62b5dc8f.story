A former soldier who served in Afghanistan may have shot his landlady to
experience what it was like to kill someone, a court was told 
yesterday.

Aaron Wilkinson, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress after his 
tour of duty, blasted mother-of-two Judith Garnett, 52, to death at 
point-blank range.

He had become ‘obsessed’ with his six months in Afghanistan, where he 
suffered a minor wound but ‘seemed disappointed at not having fired a 
shot’ there, jurors were told.

Suspect: Soldier Aaron Wilkinson is on trial for murder after shooting dead his boss, farm owner and mother-of-two Judith Garnett, with a shotgun

The 24-year-old ‘was desperate to see what it was like to shoot someone –
something he had not managed to achieve in Afghanistan’, it was 
alleged.

He told police he went ‘crazy’ when Mrs Garnett, who was also 
his employer, told him he was ‘lazy, thick and cruel’ and ordered him to
move out of her house in Leeds, where he had lived rent-free, Bradford 
Crown Court heard.

After shooting the widow, killing her instantly, Wilkinson dialled 999 
and told the operator: ‘I have done something absolutely terrible... I 
just had a moment of madness.’

Richard Mansell, QC, prosecuting, said Wilkinson served in Afghanistan 
in 2009, and ‘was proud of the fact that he had been injured’ and 
carried around in a jar the piece of shrapnel that struck him.

He claimed to have been one of a group investigated by military police 
over an incident in which Afghan civilians had been killed.

He became ‘animated’ when talking about guns and would hold a shotgun as if it were an army rifle.

Mr Mansell added: ‘He spoke about the fact that he had not managed to 
kill any enemy soldier while in action and seemed disappointed.’

A possible reason for the killing  was Wilkinson’s ‘fascination with 
guns and killing and a desire to see what it was like to shoot someone’.
Another was that he was fed up with criticism and lost his temper, the 
jury heard.

Wilkinson had worked for Mrs Garnett for ten years at her game farm, 
sharing the bungalow where she lived with her two sons. She had put up a
‘Welcome Home’ banner when he returned from war.

Mr Mansell described the widow as ‘a no-nonsense woman’. At times she 
was said to be disappointed about how little work Wilkinson was doing.

He denies murder but admits manslaughter on the grounds of diminished 
responsibility in January last year. The jury heard his defence would be
that his responsibility was ‘substantially affected’ by Asperger’s 
syndrome and post-traumatic stress reaction.

Mr Mansell rejected Wilkinson’s explanation that he suddenly lost control. ‘This was murder,’ he said.

The trial continues.
