A man who was dragged from his SUV and beaten by a group of motorcyclists following a frightening chase on a Manhattan highway has filed a legal notice saying he intends to sue New York City over the attack.

Prosecutors say an off-duty police detective was among the bikers who pursued and beat Alexian Lien after a confrontation on the West Side Highway.

The September assault was recorded by one biker and later posted on the Internet.

The New York Post reports that Lien filed a formal 'notice of claim' against the city on December 24th. It accuses the police department of failing to properly train officers.

A spokeswoman for the city's Legal Department said it would defend the claim if it proceeds to a full lawsuit.

'A vicious and unruly mob of motorcycle riders attacked and assaulted' Lien and 'vandalized his motor vehicle' by smashing a rear window where his toddler was sitting, according to his notice.

Video footage shows an undercover detective, breaking one of the windows.

He pleaded not guilty to assault charges in November.

Lien is asserting that the NYPD was negligent for failing to properly hire and train its officers.

The Police Department identified Braszczok, Rodriguez and two other officers who were involved with the biker gang.

Rodriguez,
 an Internal Affairs cop, has said he was 'nowhere near the scene' of 
the violence but admitted that he was riding with the bikers.

Eleven bikers have been arrested in the SUV melee.

Lien, 33, was driving the black SUV near 125th Street in Harlem when he was surrounded by the bike gang.

They
 pursued him 50 blocks up the West Side Highway to the 178th Street exit
 where he was pulled from his car while his terrified wife and daughter 
watched him get attacked.

Police have said the bikers who Lien were trying to slow the man down so they could take control of the highway.

Sources
 claim the motorcyclists had already blocked off some of the West Side 
Highway's entrances to stop other vehicles from joining the road near 
West 125th Street.

It was 
then that driver Alexian Lien panicked, hitting the bike in front with 
his Range Rover and sparking the videotaped chase that led to his 
beating.

Sources told the New York Post that Cruz's driving had sparked the hour-long chase as he was driving erratically, causing Lien to rear-end him.

They
 also said the group of riders was at first trying to slow Lien down so 
they could get in front of him and take over the West Side Highway.

Cruz, who is not believed to be among the swarm of bikers who followed the terrified father, was briefly hospitalized and released for minor injuries, including lower back pain, authorities said.

Lien, a Columbia University graduate, was taken to Columbia University Medical Center, where he received stitches.

Fearful: The bikers had been riding alongside the Range Rover before the incident. Shortly after this moment, the biker in blue jeans - Christopher Cruz - braked

Intimidating: Within minutes, the whole pack has caught up with the vehicle, with the family inside

A police spokesman said that Lien recalled how a large number of 
motorcyclists were driving 'erratically' and he 'accidentally collided 
with one'.

The footage shows one motorcyclist brake hard in front the the car and seems to get bumped by it.

He
 pulled over but some of the bikers started to damage the vehicle, he said. The 
NYPD spokesman told MailOnline the driver drove off 'to avoid an 
impending assault'.

The video shows the Range Rover accelerate suddenly knocking over bikes and motorcyclists, driving over the top of them.

The footage shows them following the vehicle for several minutes, at times getting close and intimidating the driver. Eventually the bikers surround the vehicle, blocking its path.

Seizing
 an opportunity to confront the driver, one biker dismounts and tries to
 open the door, but the SUV speeds off again, knocking down at least one
 more motorcyclist.

The
 family were eventually brought to a standstill in Manhattan traffic and 
immediately bikers run to attack the vehicle, smashing the driver's 
window with a helmet and attempting to smash the rear door window, where the child was sitting.
