The last king to sit on it was poisoned at his own wedding, so it was perhaps no surprise that the Queen preferred not to take the Iron Throne when she visited the Game of Thrones set.

Instead, the monarch inspected the seat, which is made from interlaced iron swords, from a safe distance before getting a closer look at the royal treasury of Westeros, laid out beside it.

She was, however, happy to hold a tiny replica and beamed as she met cast members, among them Kit Harington who plays Jon Snow, Lena Headey whoÂ  plays Queen Cersei Lannister and Sophie Turner who plays Sansa Stark.

One will not be sitting there! The Queen looks reluctant to take the famous Iron Throne, instead choosing to inspect it from a safe distance

Nice
 to meet you: The Queen is introduced to Game of Thrones cast members, 
among them Kit Harrington (Jon Snow) and Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark)

No thank you! The Queen looks less than impressed as she examines the throne, watched by Game of Thrones star Lena Headey

The set, which is in Belfast's recently completed Titanic Quarter, is where many of the scenes inside King's Landing - the royal palace of Westeros - are filmed.

Home to the wicked queen Cersei Lannister, King's Landing was the scene of several Machiavellian plots and scores of unpleasant murders, among them that of the 'Mad King' Aerys II Targaryen who was stabbed in the back by Cersei's brother, Jaime.

Luckily for the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, the cast were on their best behaviour and chatted politely with the royal couple as they showed them around the set.

Maisie Williams, the 17-year-old star who plays the spirited Arya Stark, was the first of the actors to chat to the monarch. 'She kept commenting on how uncomfortable the throne looked, that was funny,' she said.

Looks uncomfortable! Buckingham Palace refused to say whether the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh watch Game of Thrones

Curious? The Queen steps a little closer to the throne which according to Westeros legend, is made from more than 1000 swords - is she tempted to take a seat?

One is amused! The Queen seemed in good spirits during her tour of the set while the Duke of Edinburgh was fascinated by the knives and swords

'I don't think I've ever been as nervous
 to meet anybody,' added Headey. 'I didn't think I was, and then I saw her appear and I 
suddenly thought, "it's the Queen, the real Queen"! She was really cool and gorgeous and delightful.

'I
 think of everything she has done and everything she has achieved and 
the fact she is still interested even though she has met countless 
people and talked about numerous things.'

Equally excited was Harrington. 'Being here and meeting the Queen, it's 
pretty amazing that the show has done that and she has come to see the 
sets. It gives it some sense of scale,' he said.

'She is an 
incredible person. She has an incredible presence about her. To meet 
someone who has been on the throne as long as she has and has seen the 
things she has, it's quite an experience.'

One has better jewels in the Tower! The Queen looked less than impressed with the contents of the Westeros royal treasury

Nice to meet you: The Queen chats to Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark) and Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) while the Duke speaks to Lena Heady and Kit Harington

Captivated:
 The Queen and Prince Philip were both fascinated by the huge array of 
props - most of which took the form of swords and knives

Chatty
 couple: The Queen and Prince Phillip seem to have lots of questions for
 the Game of Thrones cast, among them Sophie Turner and Kit Harrington

Nervous?
 Rose Leslie (Ygritte), Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Kit Harrington (Jon
 Snow) and Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) await the arrival of the Queen

The HBO drama, which emerged from a set of fantasy novels by George R. R Martin, is thought to be loosely based on the Wars of the Roses, which saw two opposing dynasties battle it out for the throne of England.

With York on one side and Lancaster on 
the other, England was convulsed by a series of battles, dastardly plots
 and pretenders lurking on the other side of the Channel until, with the
 death of Richard III, Lancaster finally triumphed.

The Queen, who also holds the title and 
the lands of the Duchy of Lancaster, had earlier been given a snapshot 
into the UK's more recent bloody past, visiting the infamous Crumlin 
Road Gaol, accompanied by former inmate Martin McGuinness.

McGuinness, who remains a controversial 
figure thanks to his links to the IRA, also met the Queen for a 
10-minute meeting at Hillsborough Castle, her official residence in 
Northern Ireland, last night.

Not as good as the Crown Jewels! The Queen showed a healthy interest during her tour of the set and looked particularly interested in the trappings

A
 fan in the making? The Queen seemed keen to learn more about the 
programme although Buckingham Palace refused to say whether she watches 
the show

More manageable? The Queen holds a miniature 
Iron Throne and seems slightly happier with its size compared to the 
original throne

Lannister

Afterwards, he told the BBC that the meeting was about 'reaching out the hand of friendship to the Unionist community'. 'I met Queen Elizabeth tonight in my role as Deputy First Minister, representing the entire community,' he added.

'Reconciliation requires bold gestures and this is the third time I have met with Queen Elizabeth as part of that continuing process.'

Buckingham Palace declined to say 
whether the Queen and Duke are fans of the show. A
 spokeswoman said they were 'interested to see the impact the filming 
has had on the local economy and the local skills and crafts that make 
the show.'

The Queen's visit to the Game of Thrones set was one of a series of engagements scheduled in and around Belfast today. After a lunch at Belfast City Hall with local dignitaries, the monarch visited the lovely St George's covered market, where she chatted to stallholders and met well-wishers.

She also became the latest victim of an unscheduled royal selfie, as an eager young fan tried to snap a photo with her on his iPhone - much to the consternation of the Queen's security detail.

Afterwards, she was driven back to Hillsborough Castle, her Northern Irish official residence, where she and the Duke of Edinburgh joined guests for a party in the sunny garden.

Not impressed: The Queen's security detail look horrified as a local boy attempts to take a selfie with the Queen during her visit to St George's market

Adorable: The Queen looks delighted after being presented with a cushion by a tiny well-wisher during her visit to the lovely St George's covered market in Belfast

Enjoying the day: The Queen, who had changed into a pretty pale pink ensemble, beamed as she was introduced to guests at Hillsborough Castle
