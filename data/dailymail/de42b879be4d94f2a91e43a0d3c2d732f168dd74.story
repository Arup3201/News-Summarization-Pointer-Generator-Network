Consumers may be clamouring for a super-slim iPad Air 2, but there are more revolutionary tablets on the horizon.

Intel hopes to lead the way by incorporating a 3D scanner into a tablet set to be released next year.

The technology would allow users to scan an object and manipulate an image on their screen using hand gestures before printing it out using a 3D printer.

Intel plans on incorporating a 3D scanner into a tablet set to be released next year ( a concept is pictured). It would allow users to scan an object and manipulate the 3D image on their screen using hand gestures, before possible deciding to print it out using a 3D printer

Intel’s RealSense technology, which allows devices to gauge depth like the human eye, will also be included in smartphones in the next couple of years, according to the chip maker, which is based in Santa Clara, California.

Users will scan an object from 360 degrees using a specially-adapted camera, which the firm says will fit into the slimmest of tablets.

The scanner will comprise a standard webcam plus an infrared sensor to collect the depth information. 

It will ‘see’ an object in a way that it can work out how it is put together in 3D so that it can be accurately recreated on screen.

Tablets, as well as laptops and smartphones, will use advanced depth cameras as eyes and duel array microphones as ears, while people will use more precise hand and finger gestures to navigate screens

Intel's technology would allow users to scan an object and manipulate the 3D image on their screen using hand gestures, before possibly deciding to print it out using a 3D printer.

The scanner will be made up of a standard webcam plus an infrared sensor to collect the depth information.

The camera will ‘see’ an object in a way that it can work out how it is put together in 3D so that it can be accurately recreated on screen.

Users will scan a desired object from 360 degrees using a specially-adapted camera. They will then be able to manipulate the image on screen, using hand gestures.

When working together, Intel's RealSense technology will let the tablet gauge depth like the human eye and will feature in tablets and smartphones. 

The idea is that a user could then manipulate the scanned object.

So, if they scanned a teapot and wanted to make its spout longer, they could, and then print out the improved design using a 3D printer.

3D object tracking will also be used to bring books to life, allowing people to interact with characters and make playing games on tablets more immersive and precise to control.

Intel says: ‘With Intel RealSense technology, you can scan, modify, print, and share in 3D, giving you a creative platform like you've never seen.

‘What's more, you'll be able to naturally manipulate and play with scanned 3D objects using our hand - and finger-sensing technology.

Intel claims its technology will change how people interact, because next generation devices will see, hear and feel their users.

They will use advanced depth cameras as eyes and duel array microphones as ears, while people will use more precise hand and finger gestures to navigate screens.

Facial recognition and natural language voice technology will also let users edit content without relying heavily on typing with a standard keyboard, which takes up screen space on a tablet.

Intel is keen to find new applications for its technology and has launched a $1 million (£619,772) prize to encourage developers to create apps for the tablet.
