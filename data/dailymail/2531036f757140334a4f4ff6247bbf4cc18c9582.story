England's next QBE Test has been plunged back into doubt with Samoa’s players yet again set to strike following incendiary comments from the country’s prime minister.

Samoa’s players wrote to the International Rugby Board earlier this month threatening to strike over a lack of financial transparency from their country’s governing body while complaining that their weekly pay of £1,000 was wholly inadequate. England’s players earn £18,000 a match plus hefty win bonuses.

Strike action appeared to have been averted last week following behind-closed-doors discussions between players, union representatives and figures from the IRB.

But next Saturday night’s clash is again under significant threat as Samoa’s players reacted angrily to being accused of ‘childish behaviour’ by prime minister Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi, who is also chairman of the Samoa Rugby Union.

‘I’ve been in contact with the current players and I’ve been in this position myself,’ said recent international Junior Polau.

‘What the prime minister has said is him pretty much using bullying tactics. You’ve got to commend the players for trying to make a chance without getting the media involved, but it’s the Prime Minister who’s running his mouth off. There is definitely a chance the Samoa players could boycott the England game.

‘Perhaps we should have done it [gone on strike] in the past. Now is the best time to boycott that game and stand up against the corruption to force those idiots out of the union.

‘No one has seen the audit from after the last World Cup. No one knows where the money has gone.’
