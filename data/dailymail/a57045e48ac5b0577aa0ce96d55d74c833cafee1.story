Liverpool will receive the Fair Play award and the FA says its Respect Programme has helped to reduce misconduct throughout English football.

Brendan Rodgers' side, who will receive the award at a ceremony ahead of next month's Community Shield, edged out Arsenal, Everton and Manchester City to win the Fair Play trophy.

On hearing Liverpool had won the award, Rodgers said: 'We are delighted to top the Fair Play League at the end of one of our most successful seasons in recent history,

Delighted: Rodgers was full of praise for his team for winning the award

Captain: Gerrard will be unlikely to get another shot at winning the trophy he really wants - the league

'Our fans, players and staff make up what we like to call the world's greatest football family and as part of that we look to uphold the club's values which include unity, dignity and commitment, which have been shown throughout the season.'

The FA's Respect Programme was launched in 2008 and the organisation has revealed that misconduct charges in football across the country have fallen by 10 per cent while dissent has fallen by 20 per cent.

Dermot Collins, the programme's manager, said: 'Respect is the collective responsibility of everyone involved in football to create a fair, safe and enjoyable environment in which the game can take place.

'The Respect Programme has raised awareness of appropriate behaviour both on and off the pitch for players, coaches and spectators alike.'
