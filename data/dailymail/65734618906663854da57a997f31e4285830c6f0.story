FIFA says it cannot bring charges over German fans wearing black face make-up during the match against Ghana.

Several fans who were pictured with blackened faces were reported to FIFA by the anti-discrimination group FARE but no action will be taken

A FIFA spokeswoman said: 'There is no legal or factual element justifying the opening of disciplinary proceedings.

'But we abhor any insulting or 
discriminatory behaviour and we strongly appeal to all fans, teams and 
officials to uphold that spirit.'

Caught out: Two fans who appeared to be blacked up pose ahead of Germany's game with Ghana

No action: FIFA are unable to charge the Germany fans, despite 'abhoring racism'

Watching on: the two supporters were spotted during Germany's 2-2 draw with Ghana on Saturday

Moved on: The pitch invader was apprehended by Ghana's Sulley Muntari and removed from the field

Germany has a tradition of blacking 
up, often for theatrical purposes, that despite its burgeoning ethnic 
minority population and the fact that it is now unthinkable in the UK 
and the U.S., still continues to this day.

In
 January last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel courted controversy 
after she posed for pictures with carol singers who had applied black 
face paint to pose as the Three Kings.

It
 was part of the Sternsinger, or star singer, tradition of 
Dreikönigstag, the Three Kings' Day, when children go from house to 
house in groups of four and sing carols for charity.

It is tradition that one of the kings is black.Prior
 to that, the Olivier award-winning playwright Bruce Norris in 2012 
banned a Berlin theatre from staging one of his plays after learning 
that it intended to 'black up' a white actress for a lead role.

In
 an open letter he called on fellow playwrights to boycott any German 
theatre which still practices what he described as an 'asinine 
tradition'.

'Whatever 
rationale the German theatre establishment might offer for their 
brazenly discriminatory practice is of no interest to me,' he wrote.

'For,
 as little power as we playwrights have, we always retain one small 
power and that is the power to say no. To say, no thank you, I’d rather 
not have my work performed in Germany, today, under those conditions.'

Football fans took to Twitter to show their anger towards the fans who decided to paint their faces.

One
 tweeted: 'World Cup Officials cannot allow blatant racism like this 
Blackface BS happen at the games. German fans at Ghana game,' while 
another said: 'How does Germany pay homage to Ghana? By being racist in 
Blackface of course!'

In a second incident, a man ran onto the pitch in the second half of the 2-2 draw.

The shirtless fan, who is reportedly from Poland, had an email address and telephone number written on his back.

Ghana's 
former Portsmouth and Sunderland midfielder Sulley Muntari, who currently
 plays for AC Milan, apprehended the pitch invader before he was detained by
 stewards and removed from the field.

Brazil’s organising committee spokesman Saint-Clair Milesi said the man was detained by local authorities.

Meanwhile, FIFA have also been contacted by the Fare network relating to discriminatory chanting at the World Cup.

Allegations
 of the use of improper language by supporters at games between Brazil 
and Mexico and Cameroon and Mexico have been passed on to FIFA by Fare -
 the organisation in place to tackle discrimination in football.

The
 allegations centre around the use of the word 'puto' which translates 
into 'whore' and has been heard in games in Fortaleza and Natal.

FIFA said that while Fare had passed on 
concerns about both of the matches - played last Friday and on Monday - 
it was already engaged in disciplinary proceedings against Mexico.

It
 said in a statement: 'We can confirm that we have been contacted by 
Fare. Prior to this, disciplinary proceedings were opened against Mexico
 for improper conduct of spectators during the match Mexico - Cameroon.

FIFA also reiterated its position on discrimination of any time.

Controversy: FIFA have been contacted about discriminatory chanting allegedly heard during Brazil v Mexico

Concern: The allegations centre around the use of the word 'puto' which translates into 'whore'

FIFA recognises its responsibility to 
lead the way in abolishing all forms of discrimination in football. 
Article 3 of the FIFA Statutes states: 'Discrimination of any kind 
against a Country, private person or group of people on account of race,
 skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, 
religion, political opinion or any other opinion, wealth, birth or any 
other status, sexual orientation or any other reason is strictly 
prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion.'

Worry: The use of improper language was also allegedly heard during Mexico's win against Cameroon

Meanwhile, FIFA's
 disciplinary panel on Monday cleared Mexico's FA of improper conduct 
after the organisation received complaints that some of their fans 
shouted 'Puto' at opposing keepers, saying under the current rules the 
federation was not responsible.

FIFA's director of television Niclas Ericson admitted producers had 
made a mistake when they overlaid a line on TV replays suggesting Brazil
 striker Fred was offside when he scored against Cameroon.

The
 line showed that he was in front of the last Cameroon defender but did 
not make clear he was behind the ball when it was crossed by David Luiz.

He told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro: 'We are discussing why that line was drawn wrongly - mistakes can happen.'
