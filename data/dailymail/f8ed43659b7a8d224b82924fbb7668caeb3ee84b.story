There's nothing worse than a sore loser - and here's one of the worst.

Dutch speed skater Sjinkie Knegt was so annoyed his team lost a race he flipped the bird at Russia's Victor Ahn  at the finish line.

And it wasn't just a casual under the radar salute he directed towards triple Olympic gold medal winner Ahn.

He's not happy: Winner Victor An of Russia (L) and second placed Sjinkie Knegt of the Netherlands celebrate after crossing the finish line of the men's 500m final race of the ISU European Short Track speed skating Championships in Dresden

As Ahn raised his arms and pointed two fingers in the air to celebrate, Knegt also raised two fingers - the middle ones.

The race at the sport's European Championships in Dresden, Germany, was not even close. Knegt ended up losing his European medal from the 5,000-meter race as a result of his actions.Â
