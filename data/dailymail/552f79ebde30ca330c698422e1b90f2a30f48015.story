At the Liberty Stadium on Saturday, Juan Mata emerged from the bench with just 11 minutes to go hoping to turn what was to become an away defeat around for Manchester United.

But he wasn't manager Louis van Gaal's trump card, instead the Dutch boss had preferred to bring Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young on earlier in search of a winner and, as things went downhill, an equaliser.

Mata arrived at Old Trafford 13 months ago as United's £37.1million capture that was meant to halt the decline under David Moyes - instead his role now resembles the bit-part figure he was under Jose Mourinho in those dark final days at Chelsea.

It's sometimes easy to forget just how good Mata was in his first two years on English shores before Mourinho's arrival signalled the end of his time at Stamford Bridge.

Sitting in the No 10 role, Mata was the creative cog in a Chelsea side that conquered Europe in the Champions League in 2012 (with Mata setting up a goal in the final), won the FA Cup at Wembley (Mata creating Chelsea's opener) and lifted the Europa League trophy in 2013 (Mata's corner led to the winner). Second-season totals of 20 goals and 35 assists in all competitions said it all.

His failure to find a place under Mourinho looked to be United's gain. Moyes snapped him up for a then club-record fee and after a slow start put down to a lack of match fitness Mata, scored six in his last six games of the season.

But Van Gaal just hasn't taken the same shine to Mata that Moyes, and before him Andre Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo and Rafa Benitez were also fans of the likeable Spain international. Van Gaal's attitude reflects that of his former student Mourinho.

He praised Mata back in November but had earlier said he was 'not satisfied' with the 26-year-old.

'We have played well but can improve and I was not so satisfied with (Wayne) Rooney as a striker and  Mata as midfielder and that's why I'm changing,' Van Gaal said.

With a constantly changing system and a wealth of attacking options, Van Gaal wants his players to offer more than the attacking threat of Mata - hence why Angel di Maria keeps a place ahead of him despite his form going nowhere close to justifying his £59.7m fee.

At Swansea, Mata almost ended up in quarterback role, marshalling United's attacks from deep as they tried to penetrate the home side's backline late on. It didn't work. Mata created one chance but United failed to find the net and fell to their fifth league defeat of the season.

While still popular with the supporters at Old Trafford, it seems Mata is yet to win Van Gaal's trust

The Spaniard remains popular with the Old Trafford support - his goal output is still below just Robin van Persie and Rooney in the rankings of United players - but there is a sense that he could do more when the going gets tough. His last strike that turned a game for United was back in early November against Crystal Palace.

The one thing that is clear is that if Van Gaal can find a way to utilise Mata's talents, he has a top player on his hands - and one that almost single-handedly guided Chelsea to the top four in 2013. Van Gaal would happily take one of those spots himself come May.
