Scientists have made a potential 
breakthrough against both cancer and obesity after identifying a way of 
modifying a gene that controls cell growth.

Mice given an extra copy of the anti-cancer gene Pten were less prone to weight gain and were more resistant to the disease.

The Pten gene is key in controlling cell growth in both mice and humans.

The study by the Spanish National Cancer Research Center also found that the creatures with adapted genes lived longer.

Scientists gave mice abnormal amounts of the gene Pten and found the creatures also remained thin while eating high-fat foods (file picture)

The gene was also found to help mice become less prone to insulin reistance, a precursor to diabetes.

Dr Manuel Serrano, the lead scientists on the study published in Cell Metabolism, said: 'Tumour suppressers are actually genes that have been used by evolution to protect us from all kinds of abnormalities.

'This tumour suppresser protects against metabolic damage associated with ageing by turning on brown fat.'

When cancer begins to spread, the Pten gene is one of the first to be destroyed as cancerous cells begin to grow, which leads to tumours being formed.

Researchers believe the role of tumour supressors like Pten is not limited to stopping cancer, and that they could have further potential waiting to be discovered.

Giving mice more than the naturally-recommended amount of Pten appeared to keep them cancer free.

The discovery means having several genomic copies of Pten could help fend off harmful mutations.

Experts stressed that the findings still need more work, and it remains unclear just how easily the same genetic studies could be applied to humans to help fight obesity

And as well as apparently fighting off cancer, the gene also gave mice a metabolic imbalance, allowing them to eat more but remaining thinner than normal mice.

It is thought this is down to overactive brown fat cells, which were burning extra calories having been stimulated by Pten.

In a seperate breakthrough, researchers believe a natural cannabis-like chemical in the brain may hold the key to keeping couch potatoes slim.

Scientists at the University of California found that blocking the compound allowed mice to gorge on high fat food and take little exercise without putting on weight or becoming unhealthy.

The genetically modified animals produced limited amounts of the endocannabinoid 2-AG, a chemical related to the active ingredient in cannabis.

All mammalian brains, including those of humans, contain 2-AG, which is believed to control neural circuits involved in metabolism.
