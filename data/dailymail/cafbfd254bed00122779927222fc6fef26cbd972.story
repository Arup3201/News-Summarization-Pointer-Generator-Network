The 11th Duke of Marlborough died this morning at the age of 88, Blenheim Palace has said.

The Duke, whose full name was John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill, was a cousin of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill and lived at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. 

His title will now pass to his son, former drug addict and ex-convict, the Marquess of Blandford, 58. 

A spokesman for the palace said: 'With great sadness, we announce that the 11th Duke of Marlborough passed away peacefully this morning.

'Further announcements will be made in due course. As per his wishes, the palace will be open as normal today.'

The Duke married four times; first WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, mother of his first three children, two of whom survive, second Athina Onassis, with whom he had no children, third Rosita Douglas-Sjernorp, mother of his three younger children, two of whom survive, and fourth, Persian-born Lily Mahtani.

His four children are the Marquess of Blandford, Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill, 56, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, 40, and Lady Alexandra Spencer-Churchill, 38.

The marquess, his eldest surviving child, battled addictions to heroin and cocaine and three spells in prison, which resulted in his father taking legal action to prevent him from inheriting the 11,500-acre estate, where Churchill was born.

In 1983 he was fined £100 for assaulting a policeman, and the following year he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for breach of probation.

He was put on probation again in 1985 and fined £1,000 for breaking into a chemist's shop and in 1986 he was convicted of drug offences.  At that time he admitted spending £20,000 on cocaine in four months.

From the late 1980s through the early 1990s he chalked up a record of motoring offences and was repeatedly banned from driving.

In May 1994, he was remanded in custody for three weeks in HMP Brixton after failing to keep appointments with probation officers, and the following month he was put on probation for 18 months and ordered to attend a clinic for drug addiction.

In December 1999 he was rushed to hospital with a missing eyelid, a badly damaged nose, three missing teeth and a broken shoulder after a car ran into his Toyota Land Cruiser in Kiddington, Oxfordshire.

But he reformed his behaviour, stayed off the drugs, and after a lengthy legal battle, father and son put their differences behind them and agreed that Blandford would inherit the title while the estate would be run by a board of trustees including his younger brother, Lord Edward.

The Duke said: 'I think there have been black sheep in every family and there's nothing new about that. We have had some good 'uns and some bad 'uns.'

But after the rapprochement, he said: 'I am fully confident James will keep this place going.

'But over the top of him – and over the top of me – are trustees. You can’t predict the future.'

Blenheim Palace was a reward from Queen Anne to the first Duke of Marlborough for victory over the French

Today the Prime Minister paid tribute to the Duke, saying: 'I am greatly saddened to hear of the death of the Duke of Marlborough. To me, he was not only the Vice-President of my Association but also a good man and friend.

'His Grace will be deeply missed by all those he worked alongside at Blenheim and by the town of Woodstock where he played such a positive and active role in the community he loved.

'My thoughts and prayers are with all his family and friends at this sad time.'

The 11th Duke married WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, mother of the Marquess of Blandord, in 1951 

Blenheim Palace was a gift from Queen Anne to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, in 1704.

It was a reward for his victory over the army of Louis XIV of France in the Spanish War of Succession.

Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim, which became a world heritage site under the stewardship of the 12th Duke.  The 200,000sq ft estate has 187 rooms, dwarfing Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,and attracts about 500,000 visitors every year.

Its grandeur registered even with Hitler. According to wartime lore, he planned to move in after invading England and ordered the Luftwaffe not to bomb it. 

The 11th Duke of Marlborough was born on 13 April 1926, the elder son of the tenth Duke of Marlborough by his first wife, Mary Cadogan.

Winston Churchill, the then Chancellor, was his father's cousin and agreed to become his godfather. 

He was distantly related to the late Diana, Princess of Wales, through the Spencer family, and to the Vanderbilt dynasty via his grandfather, the ninth duke, who was said to have married Consuelo Vanderbilt purely for her cash.

In 1951 he married for the first time, wedding WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, and they went on to have three children, the eldest of whom, John Spencer-Churchill, died at the age of two.  Charles James Spencer-Churchill was born in 1955, followed by Henrietta Mary Spencer-Churchill three years later.

The couple divorced ten years later, leaving the Duke free to marry Athina Onassis, ex-wife of Greek shipping tycoon, Aristotle Onassis.

Like his first, this second marriage lasted ten years, after which she left him for her sister's former husband, Stavros Niarchos.

In 1972, he married Rosita Douglas-Stjernorp, daughter of a Swedish count, and had three more children.

Lord Richard Spencer-Churchill was born in 1973 but died four months later.  Lord Edward Albert Charles Spencer-Churchill was born in 1974, and in 1977 Lady Alexandra Elizabeth Spencer-Churchill was born. 

He inherited the dukedom in 1972 when his father, the tenth Duke, died, and now his oldest surviving son, Jamie Blandford, will become the 12th Duke.

Blandford has a son, George Spencer-Churchill, 22, by first wife Becky Few Brown, and daughter Araminta, seven, and son Caspar, five, by his second wife, Edla Griffiths, a Welsh ceramicist whom he met on London's Kings Road.
