Former presidental adviser David Axelrod was the victim of a putsch within Obama's re-election campaign inner circle, according to a new book

The man most responsible for getting Barack Obama to the White House – the man who had 'crafted his ads since 2004' and 'had cowritten his narrative' – was forced out of the president's inner circle during the 2012 re-election campaign, a new book reveals.

Obama's two main campaign generals marginalized David Axelrod, the campaign strategist behind Obama's 1990s rise to power from local organizer to president.

White House communications director David Plouffe and re-election campaign manager Jim Messina were in open conflict with 'Axe' throughout much of the re-election push.

Axelrod, insiders said, referred to them as 'two strongmen running the Kremlin.'

He believed Plouffe, busy in the White House, wasn't plugged into the campaign enough. And he thought Messina, whom Obama had trusted to 'run a business' in getting him re-elected, was insecure and lacked strong leadership skills.

MSNBC online editor Richard Wolffe interviewed political insiders about the campaigns for his book, 'The Message.' The Daily Beast published an excerpt on Thursday.

He details how Axelrod tried to muscle Messina out of his job entirely, but ended up as the odd man out himself.

Obama For America director Jim Messina (L) got tired of Axelrod agitating to get him fired, writes Richard Wolffe. Ultimately it was Axelrod who was ousted. Messina has stayed on, and now runs the campaign's successor organization, Organizing for Action

David Plouffe, who ran Obama's first presidential campaign, inherited Axelrod's White House job hear the Oval Office. There was no love lost between the two

Richard Wolffe, formerly of Newsweek magazine but now in charge of MSNBC.com, got access to many of the major players behind Obama's political successes

'Axelrod repeatedly tried to convince other senior aides to bypass Messina,' Wolffe writes, 'and they believed he was trying to oust Messina altogether. Axelrod had never wanted him to get the job in the first place. Now he was complaining to others inside Obama’s inner circle about Messina’s shortcomings, but there was no support for a change of campaign manager.'

'Axelrod knew that Plouffe had confidence in Messina, and nobody could come up with a good candidate to replace him. "For a good six months of that campaign, they were trying to wedge him out, which created all of the divisions," said one senior Obama campaign official. "But there was no one else, and Messina had positioned himself with Plouffe. Axe had tried a long time to prevent him from getting that job."

The affable Axelrod ultimately left the operation after he left his job managing messaging from a perch near the Oval Office, along with White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs.

'There never was another serious candidate for the position' of campaign manager, other than Messina, Wolffe relates. 'Plouffe had handed him operational control of the 2008 campaign. And the following year, in the White House, Plouffe had once again told Messina to run Chicago.'

'Implicit in that offer was the notion that the two operatives could maintain their working alliance: Plouffe would set the course and steer the strategy, while Messina would run the machine. Plouffe could stay inside the White House, close to POTUS, while still controlling a headquarters 700 miles away.

Hands-off: Barack Obama stayed away from the palace intrigue and stayed focused on retail campaigning, leaving his inner circle to fight among themselves

Plouffe (L) remains an integral part of the Obama White House, determining the course of the administration's external communications -- a job Axelrod held until 2011

The campaign itself never really 
stopped, as political observers noted during Obama's first term. Obama 
For America, his campaign committee, continued to operate hundreds of 
field offices in key swing states while the president was busy 
governing.

And the ad buys continued long before Obama was renominated as the Democrats' 2012 candidate.

'The Message: The Reselling of President Obama' by Richard Wolffe is due in stores on Sept. 19

All that continuous campaign muscle needed leadership. And all the jockeying for position brought tension on a grand scale.

When 'Axe' left the White House late in the re-election season, he soon after left the campaign operation. That, Wolffe writes, was just the way Messina and Plouffe wanted it.

Plouffe, for one thing, had already inherited Axelrod's White House job, and his office near Obama's.

Axelrod brought some of the resentments upon himself by hiring an attorney to negotiate a sweetheart deal that made him rich by taking what he called 'a very, very small percentage' of the cost of every TV ad the campaign ran -- in addition to his monthly fees.

'Messina told friends that he was acting under the president’s direction,' Wolffe writes, 'which he characterized like this: "I want everybody treated fairly, but I don’t want anybody to get rich on this. They’re gonna get rich on the books they write afterwards."'

'Many of those who worked with Messina doubted his accounts of conversations with Obama or Plouffe. But he acted as if he was empowered by them, and he was. Messina and Axelrod negotiated hard, as Messina hacked away at Axelrod's demands.'

Meanwhile, Obama himself stayed above the fray.

Axelrod, now without his trademark moustache, has retained a silent consultant's role with Obama, but no longer wields serious power inside his political organization

It's a 'business': Obama offered Messina the top campaign job, telling him he could run what amounted to a giant business venture from the headquarters in Chicago

No love lost: Axelrod and Plouffe reportedly worked together but tussled in a power struggle that left Axelrod without a formal campaign role

'Obama kept a close team of younger male staffers to manage his immediate needs,' Wolff writes, 'and that was all he needed. "He needs the guys to play cards and golf, and tell him where he’s going next and why," said a former aide.'

'"But beyond that, it’s what function you have. And if you can’t fulfill that function anymore, or someone can do it better, you’re gone. That’s hard for those of us who really believe in him. He expects full loyalty. But you need to have your eyes open."'

A hands-off manager, the president didn't like mixing it up between disagreeing staffers, according to the book.

'[A]dvisers suspected he knew about the conflicts but pretended they didn’t exist because he had no desire to resolve them, and because he hoped they might peter out. Obama wanted consensus on communications and strategy, not personal conflict.'

That left the big guns to fight it out among themselves.

Behind Plouffe's and Messina's 'intensely competitive exteriors, they nurtured intensely competitive interiors' as well, the book recounts.

But unlike Axelrod and Gibbs, they 'were still on the inside ring of Obama’s circle of confidants' and survived.
