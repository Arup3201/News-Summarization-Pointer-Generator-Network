For Arsene Wenger all that counts is the result. Somehow, this Arsenal team got there in the end.

The playing conditions, along with that feeling you get at the start of a new season and facing a team without a manager should have suited them down to a tee. It didn’t.

Arsenal were ordinary, a world away from the team that stripped Manchester City of their self-respect at Wembley in the Community Shield.

Palace, without a manager after Tony Pulis walked away on Thursday evening, felt aggrieved. Yes, they probably deserved a point.

That was until Aaron Ramsey, a tad subdued in the centre of Arsenal’s midfield alongside Jack Wilshere, came to their rescue in the final minute. Again.

For once the Arsenal fans stayed with their team, waiting patiently for the moment when they could win this game with Ramsey’s stabbed effort.

‘I am grateful to the fans because we have to face up to the frustration,’ admitted Wenger. ‘When we were one nil down they stayed behind the team, and at 1-1 they gave us some energy.’

At 2-1, they had done their job, sticking it out and sending their supporters scurrying home happy.

Ramsey’s goal was in the last knockings, when Palace were down to ten men after Jason Puncheon was foolishly sent off for a second booking.

It was reckless and ill-disciplined, the kind of mistake that would have had Pulis having kittens in the technical area.

Arsenal, though, are up and running, recovering from the setback of Brede Hangeland’s debut goal in the 35th minute to go on and secure their first three points of the season. They were far from impressive.

Perhaps, in time, we will look back on this result and salute them for sticking this out to the bitter end and biting Palace where it really hurts.

It is a measure of any decent team that they are prepared to be patient at times, waiting for the moment to pounce.

Palace will know that, particularly after some slack marking allowed Laurent Koscielny to run unmarked into their penalty area and guide Alexis Sanchez’s free kick beyond Julian Speroni.

Alexis has the touches, whipping the Arsenal crowd into a frenzy with a series of step-overs at bewildering speed in the first half. What a player he can be.

‘He needs to improve his understanding with his team-mates,’ was Wenger’s assessment of the £33m Chile winger. In time it will come.

So, too, will the performances from this entire Arsenal team as they settle into the rhythm of the regular season.

They have already lost Kieran Gibbs to a hamstring injury and they cannot allow another congested medical room to affect their season.

There are other issues, such as the scandalous failure to spot Hangeland’s run for his debut goal. Not one Arsenal player tracked him.

It was a training ground move, straight out of Pulis’s book and brilliantly executed by Hangeland when his diagonal run met Puncheon’s left-footed inswinging corner.

That rattled Arsenal. In midfield the nice touches from Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta, Santi Cazorla, Alexis and Ramsey were going nowhere. They lacked direction and purpose.

Koscielny’s set-piece equaliser changed the game, giving Arsenal the impetus to start the second half in a different gear. They did that.

The highlights must include Calum Chambers’ performance at the back. He was exceptional, breezing through this game and adapting to his new role in the team.

His positioning and anticipation is first class, a refreshing way to look at a young, English central defender. He is a top signing.

Wenger knows it and there is a chance that the former Southampton right-back will face Besiktas in Tuesday’s Champions League qualifier in Istanbul on Tuesday.

Domestic matters will dominate at Palace this week as attentions turn to the appointment of a new manager.

Palace’s directors held a board meeting before Saturday’s game, but they have yet to make a decision on the identity of their next manager.

Arsenal’s chronic set piece problems look likely to continue. New full-back Mathieu Debuchy was guilty of completely losing scorer Brede Hangeland for the opening goal, with the Palace defender ending up five yards off his marker. It remains an area of concern for Arsene Wenger particularly when Per Mertesacker is unavailable.

There is an outside chance that they will give it to Keith Millen, the impressive and unassuming caretaker coach who took the team yesterday.

He said: ‘I will speak to the chairman. The players respect me and my decisions.

‘It is the start of the season and only one game into it, but we know we can compete at this level.

‘We have identified the areas we need to strengthen and the three players we brought in did well.’

They did, but they switched off at the crucial moment when Koscielny’s header was knocked back across goal by Giroud, before Debuchy’s shot was parried by Speroni only for Ramsey to prod it home.

Without Ramsey, Arsenal would be facing up to some familiar problems.
