When Sarah and Peter Krstic's daughter Aria was born eight weeks early, the couple were overcome with shock and worry.

For Mr Krstic the situation was particularly traumatic because he knew the risks of premature birth all too well – he himself was born three months early 31 years before.

'He's always been told growing up of the stories of him when he was a premature baby and his parents going to visit him in hospital for months,' Mrs Krstic told Daily Mail Australia.

When Mr Krstic was born  he was also premature - born three months early due to a condition that causes extremely high blood pressure and can lead to seizures and organ failure

'His dad's wedding band fit around his thigh.

'If you're always told those stories it becomes real when you have a premature baby.'

Mrs Krstic, 31, from Golden Grove in Adelaide, had a complicated pregnancy because she suffered from the condition placenta previa.

Her placenta totally covered her cervix giving her no way to have a natural delivery.

'I was sort of in and out of hospital throughout the pregnancy with bleeding and then was already in hospital when I had another episode and they just decided to deliver her at 32 weeks,' Mrs Krstic said.

'I'm the optimist but my husband's the pessimist and he was just completely scared.

When Aria was born she had jaundice and had to be placed in a head box to concentrate the oxygen around her so she could breathe

'He was just thinking "Are we going to survive this with a baby to take home?" and it was quite traumatic and scary because it was quite dangerous for us.'

When Aria was born she had jaundice and had to be placed in a head box to concentrate the oxygen around her so she could breathe.

But Mrs Krstic said the most difficult part of the ordeal was having to leave her precious new daughter at the hospital for 19 nights while she and her husband slept at home.

'I was allowed to stay for four nights and once I recovered from my caesarean, you know, they can't just keep us there to be with our baby,' she said.

'It's a hard thing to explain because you have this beautiful little girl who completes your family, and you're so excited to meet her and going through all these emotions because you're absolutely falling in love.

'But you're scared for her too… You have this perfect baby who is just wonderful but you can't bring her home.'

Mrs Krstic says that in terms of premature births, her family was fortunate.

Many don't survive and if they do they usually have to stay in hospital until the date they were originally due.

'We were lucky, she was eight weeks early and was only there two and a half weeks,' she said.

'My husband was in hospital for three months.'

Mrs Krstic is sharing her family's story ahead of Walk For Prems Day this Sunday, to help raise awareness for Life's Little Treasures Foundation which she says was an important source of support and information following Aria's birth.

She still doesn't know what caused her condition, but she does not believe it was genetic as the reasons for Mr Krstic and Aria's premature births were unrelated.

Mrs Krstic says the fact Aria was conceived through IVF made her more prone to giving birth prematurely, but her older son Hugh was also conceived through IVF and was born at full term.

Aria is now a healthy, happy baby and is about to celebrate her first birthday.

'She's hitting all her milestones,' Mrs Krstic said.

'She's definitely doing everything that she should and she's crazy – she's going to be a little trouble maker I think.'

Walk for Prems will take place across Australia on Sunday 26th October in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Perth, Launceston, Brisbane and Canberra. Check for locations and starting times in each city at walkforprems.org.au
