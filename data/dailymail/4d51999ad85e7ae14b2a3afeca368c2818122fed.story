Police said the teenager showed his mother the Facebook
messages from the teacher and she alerted police.

Miller resigned from her job in the Abbott Independent

the allegations.

Deputies served search warrants on Miller's phone and
Facebook account as they gathered evidence.

They also interviewed the teen who is alleged to have
admitted to the affair.

Miller was arrested and charged when she turned herself
in at the Hill County Sheriff's Office.

Hill County Sheriff's Deputy Mark Wilson said: 'She
had really groomed him over the course of a year.'

manipulated.

himself. His parents noticed that.'
