President Obama is putting a symbolic 
twist on a time-honored tradition, taking the oath of office for his 
second term with his hand placed not on a single Bible, but two - one 
owned by Martin Luther King Jr. and one by Abraham Lincoln.

The inclusion of King's Bible is 
particularly significant since the inauguration comes on Jan. 21, the 
federal holiday in honor of the civil rights leader, who delivered his 
'I Have a Dream' speech 50 years ago at the Lincoln Memorial. Obama will
 be facing the memorial as he takes the oath.

King's Bible, which his 
children say he used early in his career as a preacher, has never been 
part of a presidential inauguration before.Â

Though there is no constitutional 
requirement for the use of a Bible while taking the oath, George 
Washington began the tradition with a Bible hastily grabbed from St. 
John's Masonic Lodge No. 1 for his swearing-in on April 30, 1789, in New
 York.

Since then, presidents have typically chosen Bibles with 
historical or personal significance, many using family heirlooms. Obama 
is not the first president to select two Bibles - Harry Truman did so 
in 1949, Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 and Richard Nixon in 1969.

The selection of the pair of Bibles by 
Obama is richly symbolic of the struggle for equality in America, 
beginning with Lincoln's emancipation of the slaves through King's civil
 rights movement and ultimately to Obama becoming the nation's first 
black president.

Inaugural planners say Obama plans to place his left 
hand on the stacked Bibles held by first lady Michelle Obama as he 
raises his right hand to repeat the oath administered by Supreme Court 
Chief Justice John Roberts.

Reverend Bernice King said her father would be 'deeply moved' to see President Obama take the oath using his Bible, the second Bible was used at President Lincoln's inauguration in 1861

It hasn't been determined which will be on 
top with Obama's hand actually resting on it, but King's is larger so it
 may need to be on the bottom.

Obama used the Lincoln Bible while 
taking the oath four years ago - the first time it had been used since 
the 16th president's inauguration in 1861.

Obama's inaugural committee 
says that the president plans to use the first lady's family's Bible for
 a private swearing-in at the White House on Sunday, Jan. 20.

Public 
presidential inaugurations traditionally aren't held on Sundays, even 
though the Constitution states that a president's new term begins 
automatically at noon on the 20th.

Vice President Biden will use a Bible that has been in his family for 120 years and that he's used every time he's been sworn into federal office

King's children describe their father's 
King James version as his 'traveling Bible' that he took as part of a 
collection of books he carried with him while constantly on the road and
 used for inspiration and preparing sermons and speeches.

His daughter 
Bernice King says her father marked the pages with several dates from 
May 1954, the same month he delivered his first sermon.

'We know our father would be deeply 
moved to see President Obama take the oath of office using his Bible,' 
King's children said in a statement provided by the inaugural committee.

'His traveling Bible inspired him as he fought for freedom, justice and
 equality, and we hope it can be a source of strength for the president 
as he begins his second term.'

Obama also plans to honor King 
throughout his inaugural weekend, beginning by asking Americans to 
volunteer in their communities on Saturday, Jan. 19, to honor the civil 
right leader's legacy of service. The King family plans to participate.

Inaugural planners also say there will be a float honoring King in the 
parade to the White House after the swearing-in ceremony.

Some presidents kiss the book after 
completing the oath. Sometimes the Bible is open to meaningful passages,
 such as President George W. Bush's choice of Isaiah 40:31 - 'Those who
 hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings 
like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be
 faint.'

Inaugural planners say Vice President 
Joe Biden will use a Bible with a Celtic cross on the cover that has 
been in his family for 120 years. Biden has used the Bible every time 
he's been sworn into federal office, back to his entry in the Senate 40 
years ago.

Turnout: The 2013 inauguration isn't expected to draw the same crowd that flocked to the event in 2009, pictured

Crowds may have flocked to the 
National Mall to see President Obama make history in 2009, but the team 
behind the president's 2013 inauguration bash later this month are 
bracing themselves for a ton of empty seats.

The ceremony
 that Washington will stage in a few weeks won't be the historic affair 
it was in 2009, when nearly two million people flocked to the Capitol to watch Obama take the oath of office.

This time, District of Columbia 
officials expect between 600,000 and 800,000 people for Obama's public 
swearing-in on the steps of the Capitol on Monday, January 21.
