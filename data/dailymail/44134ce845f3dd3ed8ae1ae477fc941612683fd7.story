The former Army psychiatrist who killed 13 people in the 2009 shooting spree at Fort Hood has said it would be 'an honor' to join the caliphate in a letter to ISIS, it has been reported. 

Nidal Hasan has apparently requested to be made a 'citizen soldier' of the caliphate in the letter to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Hasan opened fire on his fellow servicemen and women on November 5, killing 13 and injuring 30 others.

He was shot and paralyzed from the waist down in the resulting gunfire and was sentenced to death last year. 

Earlier this year FBI Director James Comey testified that he believed the shooting carried out by Hasan at Fort Hood in Texas was inspired by al-Qaeda.  

The federal government has termed the attack an incidence of 'workplace violence,' saying that the home-grown Hasan didn't meet the legal definition of an international terrorist.

In an undated letter, obtained by Fox News,  Hasan reportedly requests to be made a 'citizen' of the Islamic State.

He goes on to say it would be 'an honor for any believer to be an obedient citizen soldier to a people and its leader who don't compromise the religion of All-Mighty Allah to get along with the disbelievers.' 

It is unclear at what point the letter was intercepted after it was sent to al-Baghdadi. 

Hasan walked into a Fort Hood medical readiness building in November 2009 carrying two guns and several magazines of ammunition. He shouted 'Allahu Akbar!' - Arabic for 'God is great!' - and opened fire on soldiers awaiting medical tests and vaccines.

Hasan described himself at trial as a soldier who 'switched sides' in a supposed war between America and Islam. Government lawyers also said Hasan did not want to go on an impending deployment to Afghanistan. 

In August, a military jury sentenced Hasan to death for the shooting rampage at Fort Hood, delivering the only punishment the Army believed fit for a massacre of unarmed fellow soldiers that killed 13 people and injured 30.

A second American reportedly killed while fighting for the Islamic State in Syria was yesterday identified as a father-of-nine from Minneapolis who had vowed to 'give up this worldly life for Allah'.

Abdirahmaan Muhumed, 29, is believed to have died last week in the same battle as U.S. rapper Douglas McArthur McCain, who grew up in the same city.

Two sources confirmed Muhumed's identity and said a picture of his body had been sent to his family from Syria, according to Fox News.

State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said the U.S. has no independent confirmation of the reports, but added that officials were 'looking into it.'

Muhumed was identified earlier this year as one of a host of disillusioned young Somali-Americans from the Twin Cities lured by ISIS fighters in a sinister new phenomenon dubbed 'Jihad Cool'. 

NBC cited an anonymous member of the opposition Free Syrian Army as saying two Americans were killed in a battle last week with Islamic State fighters.

The U.S. confirmed the death of  McCain, who grew up outside Minneapolis in the town of New Hope and most recently lived in San Diego.

A relative, Kenneth McCain, told The Associated Press that the State Department called to tell his family that Douglas McCain had been killed in Syria. 'We do not know if he was fighting anyone,' he said.

Investigators were aware that McCain was in Syria to fight with the militant group, said a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss by name an ongoing investigation and spoke only on condition of anonymity.

Surveillance flights have begun over Syria on the orders of President Barack Obama, a move that could pave the way for airstrikes against the Islamic State group.
