Fans were promised a ‘sexy’ appearance by Kim Kardashian in Kanye West’s new music video.

But even those intimately acquainted with the work of the provocative rapper couldn't have been prepared for the crudely titillating ride that is Bound 2.

West, 36, smashes through all 
boundaries of taste and decency with the four minute film that depicts him writhing with the mother-of-his-child, 33, on his motorbike against a desert backdrop before the pair simulate sex.

Raunchy: A topless Kim Kardashian straddles her fiance Kanye West in the video for his new single Bound 2 

Any well-wishers hoping that the birth 
of the couple's baby daughter this June might have prompted the enfant terrible of hip hop to draw a line in the sand when it comes to gratuitous 
content will be sorely disappointed.

But as vulgar as the video is; at least Kim and Kanye are coupled together in a traditional twosome as the lyrics of the song that accompanies this astonishingly tawdry display of affection hint at a lust for threesomes, casual sex and a relationship that does well to last mere months.

He even describes a sex act in graphic and depressingly mundane detail.

After the video was revealed, Twitter immediately blew up with a collective wail of disgust as fans rushed to brand the display cringeworthy and vomit inducing.

But some commentators also noted how awkward the besotted pair seem in the film (which was shot against a green screen - another bone of contention).

Never the feminist, Kim's blank mannequin face and lack of involvement in the piece other than as a wordless object of lust hasn't won her any more female fans.

Sexy: The reality TV star writhes around on her fiance Kanye in a scene from his latest music video

Weight loss: The results of Kim's amazing 50lbs weight loss following the birth of their daughter North in June is clear

She did show off the results of her 50lbs 
weight loss since the birth of Nori, as she 
reclined on the bike alone at the beginning, wearing just tight trousers
 a pair of high heeled boots.

The video opens with an eagle and some galloping horses before Kanye appears alone on screen. 

It
 then cuts to him simulating riding a motorcycle in Utah's Monument Valley
 before viewers are treated to the first glimpse of Kim.

The
 mountains of Yosemite also feature although those watching can be 
forgiven for paying more attention to Kim and Kanye's raunchy 
performance than the scenery.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians 
star, who dyed her hair blonde after giving birth to North, shows 
exactly what attracted Kanye to her as she writhes around on a motorcycle.

Straddle: Kim straddles her fiance as he sings his latest single Bound 2

Public: The newly engaged couple make a very public display of affection in Kanye's  latest music video

Although she is bathed in shadows, it is obvious that she is naked apart from skintight trousers and high heeled boots.

Viewers are also treated to numerous close ups of Kim's face as she pouts into the camera.

The video cuts between Kanye rapping,
 wearing black trousers and a plaid shirt, and riding the motorcycle in a
 tie dyed T-shirt with Kim either behind him, with her arms around his 
waist or straddling him.

There are numerous close-ups of her breasts, bathed in shadow, as Kim lays back on the bike with Kanye in front of her.

She also showers him with kisses before the pair start making out.

Revealing! Nothing is left to the imagination in the very raunchy video for Bound 2, and there's even this unneccessary nipslip

Slim: Kim may have given birth to her first child in June but her figure looks flawless

Seductive: While Kim reclines on the bike, Kanye sings to her in Bound 2

What would North say? The couple welcomed their first child in June and luckily the tot is too young to see her parents' cringeworthy video

Premiering
 the video, which has been directed by fashion photographer Nick Knight,
 Kanye spoke to Ellen DeGeneres about his relationship with Kim, 
revealing they had been ‘practising all the time’ before Kim got 
pregnant, adding ‘practise makes perfect’.

He also spoke about his over-top-proposal, saying Kim deserved something special.

Kanye explained: ‘It was just awesome. I think that Kim is awesome and she just deserved like awesome moment like that.

Something you want to tell us Kim? The reality TV star's waist looks suspiciously tiny in the new video

‘Yeah
 she thought I was going to bring Lana Del Rey out and you know she's 
already expecting these type things. She's oh yeah, it’s just something 
that he would do… rent out a baseball field and bring Lana, yeah 
birthday or whatever‘So I knew I had to turn up more because I 
think people expect even more from me in every situation whether it’s an
 album, a video or concert, or you know an engagement. I may have taken 
it to a completely, you know, yeah….another level.'

However, Kanye acknowledged people do mock him for his public declarations of love, saying: 'I don’t know if I can express it enough. It's almost like people make fun of me for like how in love I actually am it just sounds… I just think people are just so cool with their approach to things, you know. And also I'm trying to avoid the jump up on the couch moment, but yeah it’s just, it's good.’

Kanye on Kim: 'It's incredible to have a woman like that, that you know is not using you for money'

Simulation: The movement of the bike makes it appear as if the couple are having sex

Background: The simulated drive shows the couple driving through Monument Valley in Utah

While
 one of his biggest hits is Gold Digger, Kanye, 36, added that one of 
the reasons he is so happy with Kim is because he knows the 
multi-millionaire reality TV star doesn’t need his money. 

He
 said: ‘I mean, it's incredible to have a woman like that, that you know
 is not using you for money. I just have to word it like that because 
once you become like a multi-millionaire there's a certain type of women
 out there that they go for that and they'll put on the whole act and 
everything.

'But to have someone that’s, you know, has their own s**t its um, it's…and her personality is so calming. And I don't know if that’s the way people would describe my personality so…’

Perfection: The reality TV star looks flawless in the video, with natural make-up

Tousled: Kim's blonde hair is tousled and she looks seductively windswept in the video

Kanye, whose mother Donda died in 2007, also credited Kim for helping him through the toughest moments of his life. 

He explained: ‘She's an important person that when I was at my lowest moments I could get on the phone with her.

'She would make me feel like, you know, I was here for a reason and I was, you know, I had something to say and just support me thought that.’
