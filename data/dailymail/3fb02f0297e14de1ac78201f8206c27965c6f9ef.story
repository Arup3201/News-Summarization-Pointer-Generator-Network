An incredible hyperlapse video showing President Barak Obama's Marine One helicopter landing has been captured - on a mobile phone app.

Oliver Cox, an associate producer at NBC news, claims he filmed the US President arriving at the White House using Instagram's new app feature.

The Hyperlapse footage - available for the iPhone and iPad - shows the helicopter coming into land on the grass - although the President is not seen.  

President Obama has a fleet of helicopters and decoys that are often employed for security purposes. Marine One coordinates with the Marines, the New York Police Department and the Secret Service to ensure his safety.

The Instagram app uses a similar principle to time-lapse photography which combines thousands of shots into a video. Subjects include clouds crossing a sky, a flower opening or fruit rotting as the gradual movement can be speeded up.

An Instagram spokesperson said: 'Since launching nearly four years ago, it has always been a priority to bring the Instagram community simple yet powerful tools that let people capture moments and express their creativity.

Mr Cox used Instagram's new hyperlapse feature to create the video on his iPhone

'Hyperlapse from Instagram features built-in stabilization technology that lets you create moving, handheld time lapses that result in a cinematic look, quality and feel — a feat that has previously only been possible with expensive equipment.

'From documenting your whole commute in seconds or the preparation of your dinner from start to finish to capturing an entire sunset as it unfolds, we’re thrilled about the creative possibilities Hyperlapse unlocks.'
