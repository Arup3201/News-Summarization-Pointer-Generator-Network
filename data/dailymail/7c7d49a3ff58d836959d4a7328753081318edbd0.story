Several people have been arrested for trying to cash-in on the devastation following the Moore, Okla., tornado that killed 24 and injured hundreds nearly three weeks ago.

As thousands of people struggle to put their lives back together, Moore police continue to investigate looters in the disaster area who have stolen appliances, wires and even a $50,000 watch, The Oklahoman reported. Some people came from as far away as New York and Virginia to loot in Moore since the May 20 tornado.

Three men told investigators they traveled more than 1,000 miles from Virginia in order to loot the disaster area.

Shameful: Virginia residents Steven Corky Daniels, 36, left, and Justin Wagner, 25, right, were arrested for looting in Moore, Okla., along with Steve Costello, 44, of New York, after a tornado destroyed the city

Steven Corky Daniels, 36, was arrested June 2 after a police offer saw him walking with a 'large piece of utility wire in his hand'.

Daniels, from Harrisonburg, Va., told police he was in the city just to loot. 

'[Daniels] advised he drove from Virginia to Moore ... with two other subjects for the purpose of removing steel and copper utility wire from the disaster area,' an affidavit filed in Cleveland County District Court read according to The Oklahoman.

He was charged with disturbing a disaster area.

Steve Costello, 44, and Justin Wagner, 25, were arrested with Daniels. Both also apparently confessed to police when they were questioned.

Police spotted Costello standing next to a truck attached to a trailer that had 'a large amount of steel and copper utility wire' in it, according to the affidavit. Wagner was 'going through disaster debris' before he was arrested, The Oklahoman reported.

Though Daniels and Wagner live some 1,200 miles from Moore, Costello listed his home address in Elmhurst, N.Y.--roughly 1,500 miles from Moore.

In addition to outside threats, The Oklahoman reported that some looters can be found a little closer to home.

Maria Lopez, from neighboring Norman, Okla., was arrested on May 29 after members of the National Guard and local residents allegedly saw her directing children to look through debris from the tornado. Police reported several stolen items were in the SUV she was driving 'in plain view', according to The Oklahoman.

Moore resident Edward Dean McDonald, 45, was arrested May 28 after he was seen 'loading a refrigerator onto a dolly', one police officer wrote in an affidavit, according to The Oklahoman. Police said other appliances, including a washer and dyer, were seen in a nearby trailer when he was questioned. McDonald couldn't prove to police he had permission to take the items. 

Both Lopez and McDonald were charged with disturbing a disaster area.

Looted: Even as homeowners continue to sort through tornado debris in Moore, Okla., some people are trying to cash in on the disaster, looting for wire, refrigerators and other goods

Another Moore resident Osbaldo de Jesus Sagastume-Rodas, 59, was arrested after police saw him loading 'metal, copper wires, tool boxes' into his pickup truck.

Though many of those people arrested attempted to steal wire, copper and other industrial materials, Moore residents have also reported expensive items were taken from their homes.

One Moore resident has reported more than $70,000 in stolen goods since the May 20 tornado, including a $50,000 Patek Philippe wristwatch and a $13,000 Rolex. Another resident reported $6,000 in stolen items, including a $1,300 hunting camera.

After two other looters were arrested the day after the storm, the Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner said they would develop a badge system to deter stealing, according to KWTV. Residents were to be issued badges with their picture on it in order to enter the neighborhoods ravaged by the storm for the next three months.
