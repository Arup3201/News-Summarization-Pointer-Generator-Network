Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba would the 'ideal replacement' for Steven Gerrard, according to former Liverpool forward Michael Owen.

At 34-years-old, Gerrard's value to Brendan Rodgers' side is coming under increasing scrutiny, but the lack of candidates to ill his role is a concern for many at the club.

But former Liverpool striker Owen believes there is a midfielder out there who could do the job.

Speaking on BT Sport, Owen said: 'Steven Gerrard's not going to go on forever so the ideal replacement there would probably be someone like Paul Pogba at Juventus.

'He's an exceptional talent, a young talent that can play in that drive an central midfield role.'

Whether Pogba would be interested in joining Liverpool, though, is matter for debate. 

And with long-term admirers PSG keeping tabs on the France international he would be unlikely to come cheap.
