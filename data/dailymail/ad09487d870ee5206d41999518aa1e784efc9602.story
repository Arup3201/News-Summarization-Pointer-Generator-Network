Shoppers are being 'misled' by supermarkets selling 'wine based drink' which is only 75 per cent wine in bottles that look like the real thing.

The Australian plonk looks like a normal bottle and is sold in supermarkets alongside real wine - but the small print reveals all is not as it seems.

The labels show that the 'wine based drinks' are not proper wine, with experts calling on producers to come clean about what else goes into the drink.

Industry guidelines state that any drink containing less than 75 per cent wine must be described as a 'wine based drink', but suppliers do not have to say what the rest is, other than sulphur dioxide or any allergens.

Sainsbury's is selling Copper Red and Copper White with 12.5 per cent alcohol at a price of £6.25.

Morrisons is stocking Shy Pig Red and White, at 11 per cent and 10.5 per cent alcohol, amongst some of their most popular buys at £3.29.

Tesco was selling an Australian brand called Umber, both in red and white, but has since withdrawn it from shelves.

The discovery was made by experts at the website Wot Wine, who taste and rate wines. 

A spokesman for the company said consumers were being 'misled' by the 'so-called wine'.

He said: 'Some of the wines were passable, just lacking genuine character and dilute, whilst others were unpleasant, not genuine, contrived and manufactured tasting.

'On later revealing the labels we noticed that in small print on the back label these products were termed 'Wine Based Drinks'.

'The fact that we had been misled into buying them as wine led us to do some more investigation.

'We understand that supermarkets might find it difficult to have another section for these products on their shelves and may wish to merchandise them with wines, but we feel that low strength, low calorie and these drinks might all be best for their customers if merchandised clearly for what they are all together.

'I suspect the other 25 per cent is water, but it could be unfermented grape must which would be better as at least that's in wine,' he added.

'The so-called wine is highly misleading and it's bad for the wine industry. It damages the industry's integrity. 

Wine experts say selling the bottles alongside real wine is 'misleading', and that consumers have a right to know the full ingredients in the drink

'You can sell what you like but you should tell the customer what it is, because it's not wine. It reminds me of the days when dodgy landlords would tip water into barrels of beer.

'When something is sold as wine but it isn't, that is beyond the pale. I don't think most people buying it realise what it is.'

In reviews on their website, Wot Wine said they would not pay a penny for many of the imitation wines, calling Copper Red: 'Unattractive, poor. Bitter and sweet thin drink.'

Copper White was given an even worse review, which read: 'Nasty. Unclean, pongy, thin, acidic.'

The experts did say they would pay £3.50 for Shy Pig's Juicy Red, but not the Crisp White, which had a 'sour, unfermented grape juice flavour'.

The European industry body, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, states that to be called a 'wine based drink' the product must contain a minimum of 75 per cent wine.

All of the wines were made by Australian Vintage Ltd and were shipped in bulk to the UK where they were bottled.

An Australian Vintage spokesman said: 'We abide by all legal requirements and continually review our processes and procedures to ensure this.

'It is categorized as a wine based drink as there is an addition of sugar and water in the production process.' 

A Morrisons spokesman said: 'It's important to us that customers can find products where they would expect them to be, so that their journey around our stores is as smooth as possible. 

'Every wine product we offer is clearly labelled as such so that our shoppers can make an informed decision about what they're putting in to their basket.' 

A Sainsbury's spokeswoman said: 'Copper Australian Red is clearly labelled as a wine based drink. With an ABV of 12.5 per cent, it is appropriate for it to be stocked within the wine aisle, along with other wine based products. 

'We clearly label all of our products so that our customers can make informed choices when shopping with us.'

Tesco has been contacted for comment.

Wot Wine's experts reviewed each bottle, and were less than impressed by most.

They said they would not pay for most of the 'wine based drinks' tested, some of which cost as much as £6.25.
