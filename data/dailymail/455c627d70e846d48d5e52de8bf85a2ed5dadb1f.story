A woman who was driven to lose weight after her ex-boyfriend began dating a slimmer colleague has lost 10 stone - and won back her ex.

Stephanie Nicks, 28, from Chesham, Buckinghamshire, used to weigh a hefty 20st 9lb, gorging on sausage and bacon sandwiches for breakfast, and family sized Doritos as a late-night snack.

But she was left horrified when she split up with her boyfriend, care worker Larry Nicks, 30, and he began dating a slimmer woman.

Stephanie Nicks, 28, went from 20st 9lb to 11st 1lb and had shed around 10 stone in total

28-year-old Stephanie Nicks went on to lose an astonishing 10 stone and went down nine dress sizes

Determined to win him back, the size 28 account manager vowed to ditch the flab and has since shed an astonishing 10st.

Stephanie is now a slinky size 10, and the couple, having reunited, are happily married.

Stephanie said: 'My diet was terrible. I'd scoff on kebabs and McDonald's takeaways, followed by crisps and chocolate.

'Over the years, my weight ballooned. I couldn't find any clothes to fit me and I was really self-conscious.

'Larry had always told me that he loved me no matter how big I was, but then we split and he started dating someone much smaller. That's when I realised just how much I had let myself go.

'I knew I couldn't keep eating myself into an early grave.'

Stephanie had struggled with her weight since the age of 11, when she started comfort-eating after her best friend moved to a different school.

She began dating Larry at the age of 16, and the two became engaged in 2007 after he proposed on a romantic trip to Kenya for her 21st birthday.

Stephanie described Larry dating a slimmer woman after their break-up as 'an extra kick in the teeth'. After joining Weight Watchers, she hit her target  a month before the wedding and walked down the aisle at 11st

But years of overeating saw her weight soar to 20st 9lb and Stephanie's confidence plummeted.

After a series of arguments, the couple split in late 2008. Shortly afterwards, Larry began dating another woman.

Stephanie said: 'It was bad enough that he'd started seeing someone else, but knowing she was skinnier than me was an extra kick in the teeth.

'I have to admit that I was a bit jealous, and it made me think more about the way I looked.'

The couple reconciled soon after and Stephanie used her new sense of determination to join her local Weight Watchers group.

She said: 'I wanted to keep Larry interested, but more importantly improve my health and confidence.'

Throwing out all of the junk food from her cupboards, she filled her fridge with fresh fruit and vegetables.

And instead of driving, she began to walk everywhere. Within weeks, she began to notice a difference and the couple excitedly set a date for their wedding.

More ambitious than ever, Stephanie also picked out her wedding dress. The only catch was that it was a size 10 - nine dresses smaller than her size at the time.

Stephanie said: 'It was a challenge, but it was all the motivation I needed to have the wedding of my dreams.

'As the big day approached, I became more and more nervous about fitting into my dress.

'But I kept up the healthy eating and exercise - there was no way I was going to be a fat bride.'

Stephanie hit her target weight a month before the wedding and walked down the aisle at 11st 1lb and a size 10 in September 2012.

But under her dress, she was hiding an embarrassing secret: a huge sack of loose skin on her stomach.

Unable to flaunt her slinky new figure in fitted dresses and skinny jeans, Stephanie instead resorted to tucking her belly into leggings and oversized hoodies.

Stephanie said: 'It was hideous. I'd worked really hard for my body, but I had to hide it away by dressing like an old lady.

'As well as being unsightly, my jelly belly caused itchy sores and even got in the way in the bedroom.

'In fact I hated it so much, I nicknamed it 'Flabby Abby'!'

After two years of hiding her body, Stephanie spoke to her GP and he referred her to a surgeon, who granted Stephanie an operation to remove the skin on the NHS in October 2014.

Stephanie said: 'The day of the operation was nerve-wracking, so to calm me down, Larry and I took bets on how much Flabby Abby would weigh.

'Both of us got a shock when doctors told us she'd weighed in at an impressive 11lb.'

BREAKFAST: Sausage and bacon sandwich, two hash browns, lashings of ketchup

LUNCH: Cheese and coleslaw sandwich

DINNER: Kebab, followed by a McDonald's

SNACKS: Family-sized Doritos, chocolate

BREAKFAST: Weetabix, soya milk, banana

LUNCH: Chicken and feta salad with fat-free dressing

DINNER: Chicken wrap

SNACKS: Apples, grapes

Over the next few weeks, Stephanie's stomach continued to heal and she could finally wear the clothes she had always dreamed of.

Now a confident size 10 at 10st 9lb, Stephanie says she has never felt better.

She said: 'I am so much more confident now. Larry even jokes that he's got a new wife because I'm so much more outgoing.

'Looking back, I can't believe I ever let my weight get so out of control. I'll never go back to being that big again.'
