Shedding light on the woes of the upper middle, the 'Overheard in Waitrose' Facebook page took the internet by storm.

Infants were heard pining for star fruit and lychees, as mothers barked: 'Noah! You've had enough Manchego for one day!'

But now, as hard-up families turn to budget rivals, a version has been made for the cut-price alternative: Aldi.

Not quite: Aldi may offer everything from chips to soya milk on the cheap, but this shopper seems confused

Change: After internet users flocked to read Waitrose shoppers comments, an Aldi version is becoming a hit

Poking fun: The page pokes fun at the bargain supermarket that has been snapping up shoppers from its rivals

Winning shoppers: The cut-price supermarket has become a hit with the ethos 'spend a little, live a lot'

Instead of poking fun at the cushioned lives of Waitrose customers, Overheard In Aldi's collection of comical comments depict a more downmarket shopper. 

One post on the site, which has more than 2,000 'likes', reads: 'This place is fantastic value for money, I got a shopping trolley that was on display outside for £1. Bargain.'

Another adds: 'Chantelle put that f****** vodka back you already got a bottle for ya 16th birthday last week!!'

The company, with its no frills approach and low prices, has seen sales rise by 31.5 per cent, massively outpacing the big four of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.

Aldi has made huge efforts to attract Middle Britain shoppers by introducing a range of superior products at budget prices from fine wines and spirits, to coffee, olive oil, Aberdeen Angus steaks and even fresh goose for Christmas.

The group slims down its overheads and profit margins to the minimum with minimalist stores, fewer staff and charges for plastic bags.

Confused: Compared to the Waitrose version, quotes on the Aldi page are not littered with elaborate words

Shoppers: One commenter used the format of Flo-Rida's song Low to describe the typical Aldi shopper

Dialect: While most of the Waitrose quotes have a posh air, Aldi's shoppers  speak in local dialects

Significantly,
 it does not stock any of the big brands, like Kellogg’s and Heinz, 
however it has run into trouble for creating its own cheaper copycat 
versions.

Its
 approach has proved popular because of the resulting low prices which 
appeal to a nation suffering the longest and deepest cut in incomes and 
living standards ever recorded.

The
 low prices do not mean poor quality or taste. Just last week the 
supermarket won 16 gold medals and another 10 silvers in an annual test 
to find the nation’s best own-label supermarket foods.

The
 webpage also features a conversation between two shoppers who struggle 
with simple maths and get confused by half price offers.

There
 is also a conversation in which a youngster asks their dad to buy them 
cigarettes, but he replies: 'Nah forgot my fake ID'.

Another post about an aubergine sees a boy ask his mum if the vegetable is a cucumber, to which she answers: 'No, it’s a courgette dumb s***.' 

It is a stark contrast from Overheard in Waitrose, which paints a picture of shoppers whose wealth has left them out of touch with everyday lives.

Popular: It seems the group is a response to the Waitrose page as Aldi continues to soar in popularity

Cut-price: Aldi has gained a name for winning customers with bargains - and it seems that's all they come for

One child was overheard asking his mum if they were 'doing shopping for the boat as well'.

Another
 parent was reported telling her son: 'Lucas put that falafel down, you 
already chose olives with Manchego for your treat.'

According
 to the Facebook page, one couple in the Newark branch in 
Nottinghamshire who spotted another customer with an Asda shopping bag 
said to each other: 'Should she be walking around in here with that?'

And after a Waitrose butcher told a woman they had run out of fillet steak but she could have topside instead, she replied: 'Topside? Why on earth would we feed Winnie topside?

Bespoke: Waitrose is the darling of the upmarket shopper serving the sturdy middle and upper classes

Children in Waitrose clearly have different tastes to those whose parents shop in less exclusive supermarkets

Nightmare: Waitrose customers can hardly imagine the horror of running out of such culinary essentials

'Anyone would think you wanted to kill the poor dog.' (To this, one Facebook user replied: 'You have to work at Waitrose, as I did for 27 years, to know that comments like this are not fictitious.')

A customer in the Wilmslow, Cheshire, branch was overheard telling her husband: 'Please don't rummage in the reduced bin, darling, someone from the golf club might see you.'

One child following its mother down an aisle asked: 'Mummy, are we doing shopping for the boat as well?'

Meanwhile, the Aldi page describes one shopper using the form of Flo-Rida's song Low: 'She's got them Primark bottom jeans, fake uggs with the furr, the whole of Aldi was looking at her'. 

Aldi has been contacted for a comment.
