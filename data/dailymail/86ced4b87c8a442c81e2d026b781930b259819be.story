A man who left an elderly grave digger with horrific facial injuries after mugging him has been jailed for 10 years.

Eric Hicks, 74, was on his way home to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary with wife, Doreen, when he was set upon by Jamie Evans.

He had just completed a day of voluntary work at Atherton Cemetery in Greater Manchester when he was repeatedly punched, leaving him with a fractured cheek bone, cuts and bruises.

Mr Hicks, who has volunteered at the cemetery for 15 years, agreed to let pictures of his bruised and bloodied face be released by police to help them track Evans down.

He was today branded a 'coward' by police as he was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court after it emerged that Evans had previously threatened to stab a disabled man in his own bedroom.

The attack against Mr Hicks happened on November 30, 2011, as he left to celebrate his golden wedding anniversary.

He noticed Evans walking towards the cemetery as he put his German Shepherd in his car and told him it was now closed.

However, Evans punched Mr Hicks in 
the face so hard that he fell to the floor. Evans then told Mr Hicks 
that he had a knife and ordered him not to scream or shout.

When Mr Hicks fell unconscious, Evans rifled through his pockets stealing his keys, cash, bank card and a torch.

Following the attack Mr Hicks regained consciousness and staggered into the road where he flagged down a couple in a passing car.

They alerted the emergency services and went to bring Mrs Hicks to be with her husband.

He was taken to be hospital where he was treated for a fractured cheek bone, a 
serious cut to his lip and several other bruises to his ribs, body and 
neck and has suffered permanent sensory injuries as a result of the attack.

Evans was linked to the scene by DNA which was discovered on the torch that he had robbed off Mr Hicks.

Following the case detective sergeant Nigel Rigby said: 'These incidents were vicious, unprovoked and cowardly and the level of 
violence used, particularly in the robbery, to take a few items of 
little financial value was wholly unnecessary.

'The community was obviously appalled by the violent robbery.

'Evans
 is a violent man who targeted vulnerable people and thankfully he has 
now been put behind bars. I hope this sentence brings some comfort to 
his victims, the victim's family and the community.'

Brutal beating: Jamie Evans was only caught after his victim Eric Hicks, 74, who has been left with permanent sensory damage, agreed for these pictures of his injuries to be released in a police appeal for information

At the time of the attack Mr Hicks' daughter Sue Metcalfe, 
47, said: 'My father wouldn't hurt a fly. This has sickened me and our 
whole family.

'Dad told
 me he thought the man was going to kill him. I am absolutely disgusted 
that some loser, some scum, can inflict such injuries on a man of 72 
years.

'The fact that 
he had been tending his sister's grave, and it was his and my mum's 
golden wedding anniversary, just makes it even more sickening.'

She added that, despite the attack, Mr Hicks plans to continue his voluntary work at the cemetery.

'At
 the moment, he says he wants to go back to work, but only in daylight. 
We would rather he stopped altogether, but it is something that keeps 
him busy, and lets him get the dog out, too.

'It
 was unfortunate that he had put the dog away in the car, because it 
would have protected him. He said it was breaking his heart hearing it 
barking and howling to get out as he was being attacked.

'I
 hope the man who did this feels miserable for what he has done. The 
most horrible thing was having to tell his teenage grand-daughters about
 what happened.'
