Northern criminals are up to three times more likely to return to a life of crime than southern offenders, official figures revealed this morning.

In the north east, up to one in six criminals reoffend within three months of being convicted. But in the south east and Midlands, just one in 18 convicted criminals return to crime.

The Government today admitted reoffending was too high and needed to be tackled 'urgently'. But a Labour source said the number of hardened criminals blighting people's lives in struggling northern towns pointed to deeper problems.

Almost all of the worst areas for reoffending are in the north east of England. The local authorities with the best records for turning criminals' lives around are all in the Midlands and the south east

The failure to rehabilitate tens of thousands of serial criminals is costing the country £10 billion a year

Percentage of criminals reoffending within three months:

Hartlepool 17.12%

Middlesbrough 16.79%

Newcastle-upon-Tyne 16.46%

Sunderland 14.91%

Darlington 14.88%

Carmarthenshire 14.26%

Stockton-on-Tees 13.26%

Newport 13.16%

Hammersmith and Fulham 12.87%

North Tyneside 12.71%

Redcar and Cleveland 12.59%

Gateshead 12.54%

Durham 12.53%

Wrexham 12.50%

Swindon 12.23%

Northumberland 12.12%

South Tyneside 11.97%

Cardiff 11.69%

City of Kingston upon Hull 11.63%

York 11.59%

Britain's north-south divide in reoffending was revealed in figures published by the Ministry of Justice this morning.

Town Halls were ranked by their ability to stop hardened criminals reoffending after being convicted.

Of the worst 20 local councils, 14 were in the north of England.

Hartlepool in the north east was the worst performing authority in the country, where 17.12 per cent of criminals reoffend within 12 weeks of being convicted of their original offence.

Middlesbrough, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sunderland and Darlington make up the bottom five in the reoffending league.

The only area of southern England to come close to the reoffending rates found in the north east is Swindon, in Wiltshire.

Wales is also struggling to turn around criminals' lives, with Carmarthenshire, Newport, Wrexham and Cardiff in the 20 worst performing councils.

The reoffending crisis in the north is in stark contrast to the situation in the Midlands and south of England.

Just one local authority north of Birmingham - Staffordshire - makes it into the top 20 for stopping criminals reoffending.

In the City of London, the best performing area in the country, 19 out of 20 criminals do not reoffend within their first three months are on probation.

Sandwell, Dudley and Buckinghamshire have similar success stories - with all three managing to drive down reoffending rates to below seven per cent.

All the other 20 best performing councils are found in the Midlands and the south east of England.

This morning, the Justice Minister Jeremy Wright admitted that 'reoffending has been too high for too long'.

He said: 'Last year more than 500,000 offences were committed by those who had broken the law before - despite spending of £4 billion a year on prisons and probation. We need reform, and we need it urgently.

'Our new approach will ensure that for the first time all prison leavers spend at least 12 months working towards their rehabilitation in the community.

'Local adult reoffending statistics do not show a true measure of reoffending - they only record a three-month period whereas the national measure covers a 12-month period.'

But Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'This data is very revealing and shows what a postcode lottery there is with crime.

'This confirms that depending where you live criminals are more likely to go on and commit more crimes. That's worrying and the Government need to urgently address this so all communities are safe.'
