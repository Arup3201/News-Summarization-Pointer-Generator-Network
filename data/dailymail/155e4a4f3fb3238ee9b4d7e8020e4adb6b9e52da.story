For years Samantha Fitzgerald would try her best to dodge the camera at family occasions like Christmas and birthdays because of her weight.

The sales assistant, 28, from South Wales always felt like the odd one out growing up.

She says her four younger female siblings, Lindy, 26, Claire, 24, Morgan, 23, and Alice, 15, were all 'skinny minnies'.

At her biggest, Samantha, who is only 5ft tall, weighed 15st 1lb.

Wearing a dress size 20, she felt insecure next to her younger, slimmer sisters, whose sizes range from a diminutive size six to a 12 - 14, and she loathed being photographed next to them.

Today, Samantha, one of six siblings in total, says she finally feels like 'one of the pack' after shedding six stone in just 12 months.

Incredibly, she now weighs just 9 stone and is a slinky size 8.

'I feel amazing,' says Samantha.

'I no longer feel like the fat, ugly one. It was hard being the big one, strangers wouldn't believe we were related.

'Although I love my sisters dearly, I used to feel left out at times. Whereas they used to have the usual sister squabbles over clothes, I couldn't borrow theirs as I was too big to fit into them. I used to feel envious and wonder why I had to be the fat one. It didn't seem fair.'

Samantha first noticed she was different from her sisters when she was eight years old.

'I seemed to put weight on more easily and had a bigger appetite. Whereas my sisters were quite sensible with their food, I got into bad eating habits,' she says.

'It's started by going to the shops and buying a chocolate bar after dinner and then I'd scoff bags of crisps too. 

'My mum was concerned and tried to put me on a diet but it didn't work. I would carry on buying junk food and would guzzle cans of full fat Coke too. Soon, my mum realised she wasn't getting anywhere with the diet and gave up in the end.

Naturally, Samantha hoped it was just puppy fat but when her weight spiralled out of control in her teens she knew that wasn't the case.

'I was just getting bigger and bigger,' she says.

'Before I knew it I was a size 14 and weighed around 10 stone. Bearing in mind I am only 5ft, the extra weight looked ridiculous on me.

'I used to blame my slow metabolism and kid myself that I was bigger boned than my sisters, but that's clearly not the case as we're the same size now. But for a long time I used that as an excuse.'

The fact her sisters' dress sizes ranged from a size six to a UK average 12-14 didn't help her self-esteem.

'They used to get excited about fashion. They would prance around the house in short skirt and crop tops. All the boys fancied them in school and they were pretty and popular. 

'Sometimes people wouldn't even believe we were sisters. It was really hurtful and I would get really upset over it. It's not nice to feel like the fat, unattractive one when all your sisters are gorgeous and turn heads wherever they go,' she says.

Despite their physical differences, Samantha says she's really close to all of her sisters and they would defend her if anyone said anything nasty about her size.

'One time I was walking along when some guys drove by and shouted "fat b****" out of the window. I burst into tears on the spot but my sisters were quick to shout back,' she says.

'They may be skinny little things but they're feisty madams when provoked. That night, I cried my eyes out. I hated the way people thought they could be cruel to me just because I was a bigger girl.'

After school, Sam went on to study health, social care and secretarial skills at college. Her weight continued to spiral and Sam went up to 12 stone and was a dress size 16.

'To be honest, I didn't try dieting. I just continued to eat the same junk food on top of my three meals a day.'

And the pounds continued to pile on as Samantha became increasingly unhappy.

'When I started working at 18 I would be really tired when I got home and too lazy to make something for dinner. Because I had money I'd buy a greasy Chinese takeaway and eat it in front of the telly.

'That's Okay now and again as a treat, but I was doing it three times a week and seldom did any exercise.'

Samantha continued to put on weight and by 26, she had ballooned to a size 20 and weighed 15.1 stone.

'It was horrible,' she says.

'I felt so uncomfortable and disgusted with myself for letting my weight get so out of control. On nights out I never felt attractive or sexy next to my sisters. They used to get attention left, right and centre and I had to pretend to be happy being the fat, bubbly one.

'It hurt when strangers wouldn't believe we were related. They'd act really shocked and say we didn't look anything alike. I knew what they meant by that, my sisters were hot and I was the fat, ugly one.

'It was a vicious circle, when I felt sad I'd eat more to feel better. Food was definitely a comfort for me.'

In June 2012, Samantha realised she had to do something drastic about her weight when she went to the doctors to get her blood pressure checked - but the Velcro belt didn't fit around her arm.

'I was horrified and wanted the world to swallow me up. That night, I went home and cried. I knew I had to change my life-style, it was now or never,' she says.

Shortly after, she joined Slimming World. They devised a healthy eating plan for Samantha, swapping unhealthy meals and replacing them with pasta, jacket potatoes, fruit and veg.

'Finally I'd found a diet that worked for me,' she says. 'I could eat these carbs unlimited and was allowed 15 sins a day. After one week I lost over three pounds and the weight just continued to drop off. Instead of a sugary cereal for breakfast, I'd have porridge with a banana or a low-fat yogurt.

'I ditched fizzy drinks and guzzled litres of water instead. On top of this, I started to walk more.'

Within just six months Samantha had lost four stone and was a dress size 12. Around this time, she met her fiancé, Sean Donnelly, 24, who works in construction, over the internet.

'Having a love interest in my life spurred me on even more so to lose the extra weight. Five months after meeting Sean, I shed another two stone - taking me to a tiny size eight.'

Earlier this month, Sam won Slimmer of the month and Woman of the Year at Slimming World. 'I couldn't feel better,' she says. 'I finally feel one of the girls and when I go out with my sisters they're proud of me and show me off.

'Nowadays, strangers don't blink an eyelid when we say we're related. I'm no longer the fat, bubbly one - I'm also sexy and pretty like the rest of them.

'I can finally borrow their clothes and talk about fashion with them. I don't feel like the odd one out anymore.'

Her sisters are incredibly proud.

'Sam's done so well, I'm so proud of her. It used to make me so mad angry when people called her fat and other nasty names,' says sister Morgan, 23.

'Even when she was minding her own business walking to walk people would shout horrible things about her weight. But she always held her head high and kept going. She's inspired me to lose weight, too.'

'I watched her lose weight bit by bit and she's literally transformed in front of my eyes. It's shed half her weight and it's changed her life,' says Lindy, 26.

'She's a lot happier now and much more confident. I've never seen her so determined to do something in her life, but she worked really hard to lose the weight and it's really paid off. I'm so proud of her, she's an inspiration to everyone.'
