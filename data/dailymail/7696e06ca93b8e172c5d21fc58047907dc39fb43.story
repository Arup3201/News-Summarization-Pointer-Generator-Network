Biggest in Europe: The proposed brothel in Vienna will 'cater' for 1,000 guests every day, with 150 prostitutes on call around the clock (file photo)

An Austrian businessman has unveiled plans to open Europe's largest brothel - complete with a round the clock supply of 150 sex workers and even parking space for coaches.

The £12m project, known as the 'FunMotel', will be located near the capital Vienna and have capacity for 1,000 'guests' a day across 147 rooms.

It will be surrounded by a three-metre high fence to ensure privacy and offers traditional hotel features such as restaurants, gym and beauty facilities as well as sex services including 'swinger parties, gang bangs and porn stars.'

The precise location of the new mega-brothel, expected to open its doors - or is that curtains - in 2014 remains a secret so as not to alarm local residents.

The developers, Vienna-based 8Quadrant, say the 'number of females' and the 'affordable prices' will 'ensure absolute satisfaction for male customers.'

Peter Laskaris, the businessman behind the project, said the 'four-star facilities' will be the sex industry's shift from 'grocer to supermarket.'

He told the Austrian newspaper Der Standard: 'We've deliberately spread false information about the location to avoid trouble before we had the authorisation to go ahead.

'But it will be situated in a location that doesn't bother anyone.'

All that is known is that the 'FunMotel' will be located somewhere in Lower Austria, the state which surrounds the capital.

New Viennese regulations requiring brothels to have official licences have meant locating the brothel in the city centre is impractical.

Local authorities and the police have already given their consent to the project. Prostitution in Austria is both legal and regulated.

There has been a mixed response to the news. Sandra Frauenberger, councillor for women's issues on Vienna's city council, said moving prostitution indoors 'was a priority because off the streets work is safe work.'

However, Green party spokeswoman Birgit Hebeim said 'the women and their problems dissolve into thin air because they are no longer seen.'
