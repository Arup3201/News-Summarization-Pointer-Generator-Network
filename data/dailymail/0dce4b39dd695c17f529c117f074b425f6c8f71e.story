It has hit the headlines following the  murders of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge.

But as anyone who has travelled to the paradise island of Koh Tao will testify, given the idyllic and tranquil setting, it couldn't have come as more of a shock - to locals and the hoards of backpackers recuperating on its golden sands.

Koh Tao, or Turtle Island, is known as the less-developed, laidback sibling of its more raucous neighbours: Koh Samui and Koh Pha Ngan, home to the Gap Year holy grail, the Full Moon party.

Tragic: British backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller who were murdered on Koh Tao on Monday

It's a diver's dream, with most visitors coming to make the most of the easy currents and shallow waters, and the chance to see pretty corals, bull sharks and whale sharks. 

Home to around 2,000 people, the island, which measures just eight square miles survives on its laid-back brand of tourism, with other attractions including hiking, rock-climbing or simply flopping on its bow-shaped beaches.

Averaging at around 500,000 visitors last year, the island recently started to gain popularity, and was voted Asia's number one island on Trip Advisor for two years in a row. 

But despite an influx in backpackers and travellers desperate to taste its brand of bliss, it hadn't lost its charm.

Former Dive Master on Koh Tao, Richard Woolgar, from Upminster, Essex, said: 'It hasn't been taken over by monstrous development like other places in Thailand.

Thailand's seemingly idyllic island resorts can spell danger to tourists, as the brutal murder of two British travellers illustrates only too clearly.

Glowing travel brochure descriptions of tranquil, turquoise waters, sandy beaches and jungle walks hide the fact that crime is a constant factor in this part of south east Asia.

According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), as many as 11 Britons have been murdered in Thailand since 2009.

In a 2012/13 New Year's Eve party Londoner Stephen Ashton, 22, was killed in a bar on Haad Rin beach on the Thai island of Koh Pha Ngan - a resort where the FCO warns British travellers to beware 'vicious, unprovoked attacks by gangs'.

The FCO says such attacks are particularly common around the time of Full Moon parties and generally occur late at night near bars in Haad Rin, the home of Kho Pha Ngan's infamous Full Moon party, an all-night, extravaganza of alcohol and dance music that has become hugely popular among tourists travelling through the country.

British visitors are also warned that violent assaults and robberies have been reported in the resort town of Chaweng in Koh Samui. 

Attacks have also occurred in other tourist districts in Thailand including Chiang Mai, Pattaya and Krabi. In July last year an American was stabbed to death, and his son seriously injured in an attack in a bar in Krabi. On crime generally, the FCO warns Britons to beware scams, pickpockets, bag-snatchers and credit card fraud.

Just a few weeks ago, the FCO published comprehensive, country-by-country lists of places where Britons needed consular assistance in the 12 months ending March 2014.The list also showed where Britons have been victims of crime.

Taking into account the number of visits made by Britons to a country as well as the number of Britons living in that country, Thailand was second only to the Philippines in being the destination where Britons needed the most consular assistance.

In 2013/14, Britons made more than 906,000 visits to Thailand - a country where around 50,000 Britons live. There were 1,164 incidents of consular assistance, including 11 cases of rape, six of assault and 267 instances of Britons being taken to hospital.

There were also 362 deaths of Britons in Thailand in 2013/14. 

Although this figure included those who died of natural causes, the total was more than in any other country except Spain, which received around 12 times the number of Britons than Thailand.

The latest murder is a further setback for Thailand's tourism industry which is still recovering from the military coup which took place in May this year. 

'The locals have made a conscious effort to maintain the beauty of the island whilst encouraging the life blood that is tourism. 

'Backpackers also use it as a safe haven to recuperate from the Full Moon Parties on Koh Phangan. It's one of the most relaxing places that I visited on my travels. 

'Time slows to a crawl and the laid back vibe is very infectious. It's the sort of place you'll plan to visit for a week and end up staying a month.

'It's also, in my opinion, one of the safest places I visited. With it being such a small island, it's very easy to see that there's a family mentality among both the locals and the tourists.'

But the increase in young travellers wanting to party, is unnerving to some. 

Ben Ruji, Marketing Director at Koh Tao Bamboo Huts, not far from where Ocean View Bungalows, on Sairee beach where the couple were staying before they were killed, says the island has had a lot more teenage visitors in the last several years.

Ruji, 39, told Mail Online Travel: 'There are noticeably more teenagers and young people are heading to Sai Ree for drinking or even binge-drinking.

'As the island is getting more "developed" we can see a lot of businesses taking short-cuts. People are different. Although the ambiance of the island remains laid back, we can see changes in the crowd.

'Sometimes, we found the Britons and Aussies to be more of trouble-makers because they usually travel in groups. Most of the Europeans are travelling in couples or families.

'I think there is a number of factors at play here: Younger crowds, more people - which means more problems, and no real limitation or age check on drinking age on the island.

'There's also just a small number of police. I think they have only seven on the island.

'This crime has shaken the island terribly.There were some petty thefts and bar fighting before, but mostly it happened to the local people. Never tourists.

The village of Hat Sai Ri, where the bodies of the British couple were found, is one of the island's busiest resorts, comprising mid-range hotels, restaurants, bars, and a multitude of dive centres.

There is a huge variety of accommodation for every budget in Koh Tao. The most developed and popular areas are Sairee, Mae Haad & Chalok Baan Kao.

Room qualities range from basic huts, boutique hotels and beach resorts to luxury villas with all western amenities, with basic bungalows with showers and toilets starting from 400 Baht daily (around £7) but can be as low as £4. 

Some of the more remote bungalows use their own generators, which may be shut off at certain times. 

GETTING AROUND

Aside from one major concrete road which connects Sairee with Chalok Baan Kao, and a small amount of concrete roads leading to other beaches, Koh Tao is made up of dirt tracks - to challenge even the most skilled driver.

Steep trails, sharp curves, sand and grit, potholes, washed out tracks and the occasional dropping coconut demand mindful driving and fast reactions.  

Modes of transport included pick-up and motorbike taxis, boat taxis and mountain bikes for rent. The colourful, traditional Long Tail Boats take you conveniently and quickly to stunning remote beaches and secluded bays.  

'Crime rates are very low because most local people know that they cannot get at with it because it is a small island where most of the people know each other. So they wouldn't risk doing anything that will destroy their reputation. 

'We are very sorry about this too. It is very sad.' 

More than 70 police officers have been deployed to Koh Tao to investigate, as the country's leaders called for a swift investigation into the brutal killings that were a new blow to Thailand's tourism industry.

The country's Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha said: 'This should not have happened in Thailand. It will affect our image in the eyes of international countries', urging the media to warn tourists about travel safety in Thailand.

'In their countries, (foreigners) can travel wherever they want, so they thought it is safe, but in our country, there are still problems. There are different types of people, so they have to be careful.

'Those related must warn them and this incident has to be investigated because Thai people won't tolerate this.'

Defense Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said police were working 'to make an arrest as soon as possible.'
