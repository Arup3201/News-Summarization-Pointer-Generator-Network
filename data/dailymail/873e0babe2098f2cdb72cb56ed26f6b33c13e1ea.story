A Kiwi war veteran waited 41 years until he finally came across a design that he fell in love with for his second tattoo and the social media world feels just as strongly about the new piece of body art.

New Zealander Bruce Neal was just 18 when he got his inked creation of a kiwi bird on his shoulder - and now at 52 years old he has World War I soldiers marching into the distance in a shape of a fern with the words 'Lest We Forget' written below.

When Pieces of Eight Tattoo Studio, on the northeast of Wellington, posted the design on their Facebook page, they could never have anticipated the viral sensation caused by the emotive artwork.

The tattoo that the social media world fell in love with -  World War I soldiers marching into the distance in a shape of a fern

Bruce Neal waited 41 years until he finally came across a design that he fell in love with for his second tattoo

Mr Neal saw the image a few months ago on a historical information board along the Wellington waterfront where the troops left for Gallipoli.

Then his wife spotted the same design again on TV last week which was when he knew it was just meant to be and made an appointment last Thursday for his second 'toughie sticker'.

'I chose it for myself and nobody else - it was my way of showing respect,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I did it for the old guys (soldiers) who don't get much publicity - and there are not many of them left now.'

Mr Neal now works an ice cream salesman, but spent 18 years in the army where he met his wife - and their daughter also works for the Air Force.

Other social media users then posted their own similar designs  of the soldiers

He is flabbergasted at how his idea for the tattoo has taken off around the globe.

'It must have hit a cord with people around the world - I couldn't believe it,' he said.

'The tattooist got a call from Russia today asking for the stencil.'

The photo of Mr Neal's tattoo has so far received 130,000 likes, almost 44,000 shares and close to 5,000 comments on the tattoo studio's Facebook page.

Some decided to share their similar designs that they had inked on their skin while many others expressed that they didn't usually like tattoos but were really impressed with Mr Neal's. 

Tattoo artist Derek Thunders said most posts of the studio's body artwork get about 80 likes over a couple of weeks.

'When it got to 2,000 likes I took a screenshot, because I thought it would tail off pretty soon,' he told stuff.co.uk.

He said people have started asking for the same design but he would not replicate as he prefers to make unique creations.
