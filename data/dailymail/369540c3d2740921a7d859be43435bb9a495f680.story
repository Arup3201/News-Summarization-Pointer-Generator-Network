Cats may not generally appear to be keen on water but when it's required they can match dogs stroke for stroke ... if they want to.

Deja, a F2B Savannah kitten, is a case in point as she shows a natural affinity with the water while taking what her owner Lacey Procell from Baton Rouge in Louisiana says is her first ever swim in a pool.

Like everything with the independent-minded darlings, a moggy will swim when it feels like it  or has to - this was a combination of the two with the little cat being placed in the middle of the water on a floating pillow while being called by Lacey.

The adorable kitty  takes surprisingly little coercing. After Lacey calls her a few times she takes a few carefully considered seconds and jumps in.

She then confidently paddles across the pool, aided by her own little blue life jacket.

'[Deja] will jump in the lake behind our house, tub, sink, or puddles if we are out for a walk,' Lacey tells Mailonline. 'She turns everything into a game. She will fetch, sit, and can jump almost six feet. She is fearless and has an amazing personality.'

Deja also loves car rides and given the chance will hang her head out of the window like a dog. 

'She also loves going through the automatic car wash. It's like a rollercoaster ride to her,' Lacey adds.

Deja reaches Lacey in the pool video, we can here her saying, 'There you go, good girl, good girl.'
