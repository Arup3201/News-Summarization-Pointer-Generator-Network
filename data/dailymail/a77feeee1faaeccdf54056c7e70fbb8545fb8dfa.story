Health insurance companies are crying foul over new measures President Obama announced Thursday as a political tweak to his fast-disintegrating Affordable Care Act, making the fix potentially worse than the problem.

But Republicans are set to up the ante even further with a vote Friday that could push insurers to honor or reissue policies ripe for cancellation under Obamacare for the long haul, instead of merely giving them the option for one year.

The White House said Thursday that the president would veto the bill, but it's unclear whether he will have the political will to do so when the time comes.

The president declared that insurance companies could allow Americans to keep their health insurance plans without paying for costly upgrades that satisfy the Obamacare law's stringent requirements.

Meanwhile, state insurance commissioners joined a conference call to carp about what it will mean for their industry, and whether Obama's latest pivot will make things even worse.

'This whole thing – it's a mess,' an 
insurance company official told MailOnline, speaking on background. 
'With six weeks left before New Year's, I don't know how the White House
 expects us to fix what's already happened.'

Obama 'kind of threw us under the bus today,' one of the regulators told The New York Times.

The president will meet with a group of insurance company CEOs on Friday to persuade them that his plan is feasible, but he can't force them to reissue plans that they've already cancelled.

Obama's new strategy is more political than practical, designed to discourage Democrats who face tough re-election battles from defecting to support the GOP's plan.

'There
 is no doubt that our failure to roll out the [Affordable Care Act] smoothly has put a 
burden on Democrats, whether they're running or not,' he said Thursday, 'because they stood 
up and supported this effort through thick and thin. And, you know, I feel deeply responsible for making it harder for
 them.'

Whether or not House Republicans win over Democrats on Friday, they will almost certainly pass the bill offered by Michigan Rep. Fred Upton.

The resulting stalemate will put pressure back on the president, who lacks the legal authority to change the law without intervention from Congress.

'The president’s "administrative fix" is an attempt to create a lifeboat for ObamaCare to get his party through the 2014-midterm elections,' said South Carolina Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan. 'The president’s actions appear to be unconstitutional.'

'He didn't really fix anything' on Thursday,' NBC White House Correspondent Chuck Todd said Friday morning, 'There's nothing that was fixed, because he doesn't have the power to do it.'

Obama's new plan, the insurance 
companies fret, won't magically fix things for the estimated 5 million 
people who are already affected.

And some in the industry believe that Obama is setting them up to be the fall guys if the latest flavor-of-the-month tweak to Obamacare sours.

'What we want to do,' the president said Thursday at the White House, 'is to be able to say to these folks, "you know what, the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan.”'

The real reason may end up being laws at the state level that govern the insurance market.

CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, a large insurer in Maryland and the District of Columbia, said in a statement that 'we are strictly bound by state laws.'

'At the moment,' the insurer said, 'it is unclear whether state laws would preclude us from doing what the president has proposed.'

Worse, prices could go up if they managed to do Obama's bidding.

'Changing the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,' America's Health Insurance Plans president Karen Ignagni warned on Friday. 'Premiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new [federal] marketplace.'

Young people who have insurance and have received cancellation letters will likely stay out of the system if they can. They're the healthiest Americans whom the White House needs to sign up in order to balance Obamacare's books.

They're also the most likely to have budget-minded insurance policies that don't meet Obamacare's strict requirements.

'If due to these changes fewer younger 
and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, 
premiums will increase in the marketplace and there will be fewer 
choices for consumers,' Ignagni predicted.

'Fewer healthy people and younger people would be leaving their current plans,' health insurance actuary Jim O'Connor, told The Wall Street Journal. 'The exchanges are likely to be left with a less healthy distribution than they otherwise would have been.'

House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio slammed the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, insisting it's time to 'scrap this law once and for all'

Louisiana insurance commissioner Jim Donelon, who serves as president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, said in a statement that 'it is unclear how, as a practical matter, the changes proposed today by the president can be put into effect.'

'In many states, cancellation notices have already gone out to policyholders and rates and plans have already been approved for 2014. Changing the rules through administrative action at this late date creates uncertainty and may not address the underlying issues.'

Washington state insurance commissioner Mike Kreidler said Thursday that he has 'serious concerns about how President Obama's proposal would be implemented and more significantly, its potential impact on the overall stability of our health insurance market.'
