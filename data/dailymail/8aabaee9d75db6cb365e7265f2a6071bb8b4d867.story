Andrew Auwkit, 25, stabbed his girlfriend with a knife and fork, puncturing her lung, at a family meal on the day he was released from jail

A man who stabbed his girlfriend with a knife and fork because she turned down his mother's cooking has been jailed for six years.

Andrew Auwkit lost his temper with his girlfriend during a family meal on May 9 - the day he was released from jail.

A court heard the 25-year-old, from Coventry, was at his parent's dinner table when the woman - who has an eating disorder - said she did not want to eat the food his mother had prepared.

He launched at his girlfriend in a frenzy calling her a 'fussy eater' and plunged his cutlery repeatedly into her chest.

His terrified victim, who has not been named, was left bleeding heavily at the table and suffered multiple injuries, including a collapsed lung.

Auwkit dialled 999 after attacking her - but once he was arrested he sent her a series of threatening letters from custody trying to get her to drop her complaint.

She ignored them, and he was jailed for six years yesterday at Warwick Crown Court after he admitted 
wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and perverting the course of justice.

Judge Richard Griffith-Jones told him: 'When she was not receptive to 
eating your motherâ€™s cooking with the appreciation you had hoped, you 
completely lost your temper.

'You
 used weapons which were at hand, and in a bad-tempered and persistent 
attack you caused more than one wound and injured her in a distressing 
way because one of the blows caused her lung to collapse.

'At the same time I have to deal with you for a serious case of doing acts intended to pervert the course of justice.'

Auwkit was sentenced at Warwick Crown Court, which heard he threatened his girlfriend not to press charges

The court heard the vicious attack happened on the same day Auwkit was released from prison.

He was previously jailed for 16 weeks at Coventry Magistrates Court in April this year for breaching a sexual offences prevention order and for riding a motorbike while disqualified.

But because of the time he had spent in custody, he was freed on May 9, when he was met by his girlfriend.

His defence barrister said he had expressed remorse and told the court there was no lasting consequences from her injuries.
