Arsenal came from two goals down at Goodison Park to secure a 2-2 draw with late goals from Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud after Seamus Coleman and Steven Naismith had struck for Everton.

Here, Sportsmail's Adam Crafton gives his opinion on his performance of the players. 

Everton - 4-2-3-1

T Howard - 6

Assured presence, fast off his line and smart save to deny Giroud.

S Coleman - 7

Few defensive lapses but relentless going forward and a belting header to open the scoring. 

Opener: Seamus Coleman popped up on the right-hand side to score Everton's first

P Jagielka - 6

Saw off Sanchez with ease but Giroud offered greater problems.

S Distin - 6

Another dominant showing but should have seen the game out better.

L Baines - 6.5

Usual attacking flair as he rampaged forward and impressive defensively.

J McCarthy - 7.5

Athletic, dogged and influential in the midfield, setting a breathless tempo for his team.

Slotted: And Steven Naismith popped up to net the second just before half time

G Barry - 6.5

Glorious cross for Coleman's goal and a reliable shield in the front of the back-four.

K Mirallas - 5.5

Costly miss in the first-half when should have scored when clean through on goal.

S Naismith - 6.5

Infectious in his work-rate and a smart finish to put Everton 2-0 up.

S Pienaar - 6

Replaced by Leon Osman after just 10 minutes, who was his typical tireless self on the left-side.

Strength: Arsenal's defence struggled to deal with the power of Romelu Lukaku throughout the first half

R Lukaku - 6.5

Unstoppable run for the second goal but wasteful on the counter in second-half. 

Substitutes

Osman (for Pienaar, 10), McGeady (for Lukaku, 75), Joel, Besic, Atsu, Stones, Alcaraz.

R Martinez - 6

For 75 minutes, this was a powerful statement of Everton's intentions for this season. Martinez will be irritated that his side lacked the wit to close out out the game. Two draws to begin the season, both from winning positions.

One back: Aaron Ramsey grabs the ball after scoring the goal that got Arsenal back into the game 

Arsenal - 4-2-3-1

W Szczesny - 5.5

Exposed for both goals but little to do as Everton sat back in the second half.

M Debuchy - 6

Stirring battle with Mirallas but could have offered more when Arsenal attacked.

C Chambers - 5.5

Bright start at Arsenal but sold himself too easily as Lukaku charged through for Everton's second.

P Mertesacker - 5.5

Another victim of Lukaku's power and the German struggled on his Premier League return.

Lacking sharpness: Mesut Ozil had a tough afternoon in his first game back for the Gunners

N Monreal - 5

Fast asleep as Coleman stole in to score but great cross for Giroud's equaliser.

A Ramsey - 6

Tidy in possession and led the comeback as he nipped in to pull one back.

M Flamini - 5

Overran in the middle and must be more influential in these big matches

A Oxlade-Chamberlain - 6

Missed Arsenal's best chance of the first-half showed an attacking spark. 

Off the pace: Alexis Sanchez struggled before being withdrawn at the interval

Wilshere - 4.5

Another below par-showing and booked for a rash challenge on Barry after the restart.

M Ozil - 5

Anonymous on the left-side and couldn't keep up with Coleman's attacking forays.

A Sanchez - 4

Hooked after 45 minutes and can have no complaints. Looked light-weight and miles off-the pace. 

Bullet header: Olivier Giroud rescues the Gunners with a last-minute equaliser

Substitutes

Giroud (for Sanchez, 45), Cazorla (for Wilshere, 74), Campbell (for Oxlade-Chamberlain, 74), Martinez, Koscielny, Rosicky, Bellerin.

Arsene Wenger - 6.5

His major summer signing Alexis Sanchez was a huge disappointment and Giroud simply had to come on at the interval. Wenger had the gall to make the change and it paid off. A good point but more bite is needed in midfield.
