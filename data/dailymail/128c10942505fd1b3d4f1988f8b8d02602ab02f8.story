Middle class squatters who turned a contaminated site near Heathrow into an organic market garden have lost their appeal against eviction.

But senior judge Sir Alan Ward, who dismissed their challenge to a county court decision to evict them, said 'not all squatters were bad'.

The group, known as Grow Heathrow, trespassed onto the private land, in Sipson, Middlesex, in March 2010.

They cleared the former plant nursery of car fuel spillage and rubbish before restoring it with a range of glass houses, which became their homes.

Grow Heathrow, squatters who turned a contaminated site near Heathrow into an organic market garden, have lost their appeal against eviction

Grow Heathrow, also known as Transition Heathrow, describes itself as a grassroots action group

Described as mature, intelligent and highly articulate individuals who has simply chosen a different way of life, they won the praise and support of the villagers.

But judges at the Court
of Appeal said, they - or at least some of them - were experienced 
squatters and knew precisely what they were doing when they entered the 
land.

Dismissing their challenge to a 
county court decision, in July 2012, to make a possession order in 
favour of land owner, Imran Malik, Sir Alan Ward said the idea that an 
Englishman's home is his castle was firmly embedded in English folklore.

'But 
what if the invaders occupy for long enough to establish their home 
within the keep? Whose castle is it now? Whose home must the law now 
protect?' he said.

He added that the castle 
metaphor was quaint but outmoded and had been overtaken by human rights legislation. He said the traditional understanding of landowners’ rights should be rethought.

Sir
Alan said that an owner was entitled to the return of his property 
unless some exceptional circumstances militated against it.

He
said the county court which had ordered the eviction was fully alive to
the fact that the group were 'good' squatters and was obviously 
impressed by them and, to that extent, sympathetic towards them.

Sir Alan said that an owner was entitled to the return of his property unless some exceptional circumstances militated against it - even though the group were 'good squatters'

Sir Alan added that he, too, could admire the good work they had done.

He said that the position should be the same for private land as it is for public authorities, meaning that applications for possession orders should be subject to a proportionality test.

However, his two fellow judges, Lord Justice Lloyd and Lord Justice Toulson gave a majority decision that the traditional rule should still apply until a case that directly raises the point.

They agreed that the appeal should be dismissed on the basis that the judge was entitled to find that immediate eviction would not be disproportionate.

He said under provisions outlined in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), squatters have a right to respect for their homes', he said.

'The castle metaphor is quaint but outmoded: the correct legal question to be asked since the Human Rights Act 1998 came into force in October 2000 is how, if at all, if squatters have established homes on the land without the leave of the landowner, does the court, faced with a claim for possession by a private landowner against the trespassers, give effect to the squatters' right to respect for their homes guaranteed to them by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights?'The judges ruled that the eviction order did not conflict with the squatters’ rights under the ECHR.

Later, lawyer Jayesh Kunwardia of Hodge Jones & Allen, said: 'When Grow Heathrow moved to the land, it was being used as a dumping ground for hazardous items. The Grow Heathrow occupiers have since transformed the land into a flourishing community garden. They will now look to appeal directly to the Supreme Court and will do everything they can to protect their community from being trashed again.'
