An 11-year-old Oregon boy was killed Thursday and his mother seriously injured after a tree collapsed on top of their car during the wild storms that battered the west coast.

William Graham, a junior at Lake Oswego Junior High School, and his mom were trapped inside their vehicle following the accident in southwest Portland.

Emergency crews were called to Southwest Terwilliger Boulevard near Castleridge Lane at 5.30 pm after a cyclist riding past saw the car.

The boy's mother, Susan Graham, 50, of Lake Oswego, was rushed to a Portland hospital with injuries described as traumatic and possibly life-threatening, according to KPTV.

Killed: William Graham died Thursday night after an old cedar tree collapsed onto the car his mother was driving in southwest Portland, trapping both in the vehicle. He died at the scene.

William died at the scene.

Police say a dead cedar tree fell on the car.

Police say that, after being hit by the tree, the car traveled about 50 feet before crashing into another tree.

Mrs Graham was found conscious and bleeding from the nose.

She kept saying 'my son is very ill', the man who found the two told Oregon Live.

'She was doing what she could,' the man said. 

'She was very brave.'

Scene: The car was crushed by the tree along Southwest Terwilliger Boulevard near Castleridge Lane at 5.30pm Thursday

Police and fire crews arrived at the scene to find both mother and son trapped in the vehicle

The passenger side of the car was almost completed flattened by the impact of the tree.
