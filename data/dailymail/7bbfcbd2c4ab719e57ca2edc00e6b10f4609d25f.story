Almost a fifth of Britain's mothers and fathers believe drinking alcohol actually helps make them a better parent, a disturbing new report has revealed.

A survey by the charity 4Children highlights a 'silent epidemic' with a worrying six out of 10 parents claiming their drug or alcohol use had no effect on family life.

Of those questioned, seven per cent admitting drinking every day while only nine per cent thought their drinking had a negative effect.

Mothers' ruin: But just under a fifth of mothers and fathers questioned in a recent survey said they thought drinking made them a better parent

One in five said the thought their level of drinking impacted 'positively' on their parenting skills.

Fathers were found to be more than three times as likely to drink every day than mothers and more than twice as likely to have tried illegal drugs.

Many parents appear to turn to drink to help cope with the pressure of bringing up children withÂ  17 per cent admitting they increased the amount of alcohol they consumed after the birth of their first child.

Many reported feeling that having children actually encouraged them to drink more.

Wealthier
 parents were found to be four times as likely to drink every day than 
poorer ones while older parents and women who were most likely to 
dismiss the idea that alcohol or drugs could have a negative effect.

Of the parents questioned for the 4Children survey:

Mark Bennett, Director of policy at 4Children said the finding back up the belief that many British parents view drinking alcohol 'as normal as drinking tea".

He told the Independent on Sunday: 'Part of the problem is people don't realise that they are causing problems by drinking to excess habitually.

'It could first be one glass, which leads to another. If parents have had a bottle of wine or more, their ability to react to their child, especially a small child, will be impaired.'

Over a fifth of British children are believed to be living with a parent who drinks to dangerous levels while six per cent are thought to be living with a dependent drinker.

Of British children who were subject to care proceedings, roughly 62 per cent had parents with a history of alcohol misuse with more than a third of all domestic violence cases involving alcohol.

The charity is now calling for lessons of the dangers of alcohol abuse to be taught in schools as part of a 'major public information campaign'.

And they want cigarette packet-style health warnings targetting pregnant women to be placed on bottles and cans.

well as prevention strategies to be put in place, before alcohol and drugs 'take a grip on families'.

The report follows a survey by parenting website 'Netmums' which found that nearly a third of mothers drink more than the government's recommended amount of alcohol.

Founder of Netmums, Sally Russell, told the Independent: 'While it's always the priority that children are kept safe', it's also 'vital that parents feel supported in order to begin to change their behaviour, rather than feeling preached at.

'No parent wants to be an addict harming their own children, so services must work together to provide the best environment for change.'
