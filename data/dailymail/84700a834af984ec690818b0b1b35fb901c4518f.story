Film fans are being charged an extra £1 a ticket to see the latest blockbusters.

The Odeon cinema chain has imposed the surcharge on Hollywood movies including Interstellar and the third in the Hunger Games series.

It says the £1 extra is part of its ‘dynamic pricing’ policy.

It costs £1 more to watch Hollywood blockbuster Interstellar (pictured) than British films at one of Odeon's cinemas because the chain has imposed a surcharge on popular Hollywood movies

But the move will infuriate filmgoers who feel that a trip to the cinema, from overpriced popcorn to the higher cost of peak-time screenings, is already a rip-off.

At the Odeon in Richmond upon Thames, South West London, the adult price to see Interstellar, starring Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey, is £11.50, or £9.30 for a teen and £8.75 for a child.

But they would all pay £1 less for popular British films such as The Imitation Game, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, or Mr Turner, starring Timothy Spall, at the same cinema. 

Similarly, the price for a family of four going to see The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, starring Jennifer Lawrence, would be £35 in Richmond, £4 more than they would pay to see the British films.

The Odeon’s policy appears to be driven by demand.

Like other cinemas, it already charges much more to watch a film in some parts of the country, particularly the South, than in others.

For example, at the Odeon in Hull a family of four would pay only £18 to see Interstellar and The Hunger Games – around half what they would have to pay in Richmond.

Industry blog Film Divider found the surcharge for blockbusters is applied in Odeons across the country. 

A member of staff at one cinema told the blog that it was necessary to ‘pay for the extra staff’ for a popular film. 

In a statement, the company said the surcharge was ‘so we can give our guests the very best experience and keep it that way’. 

It added: ‘We operate a dynamic pricing policy so that we can offer some excellent discounts during our quiet periods.

‘As Interstellar is a blockbuster film and has a high popularity rating, the premium price is applied. 

'However this extra £1 will be dropped from the films after a few weeks of release.’

Zygi Kamasa, UK boss of Lionsgate – the studio behind the Hunger Games franchise – said it was right to charge more to see American blockbusters – which cost hundreds of millions to make – than for cheaper British movies. 

He told the Screen Daily website: ‘I think we should see UK films priced at £4 and US films at £10. A trip to the cinema isn’t cheap any more.’
