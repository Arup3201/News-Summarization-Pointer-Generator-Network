A British terrorist has been linked to one of the worst disasters in CIA history.

Omar al-Britani fought for the al-Qaeda and the Taliban before he was recently killed but has been linked to an attack in Afghanistan in 2009 that killed seven agents.

In a video posted on jihadist websites, he is shown introducing notorious killer Abu Dujana in English, calling him 'my brother', according to The Sun.

Triple agent: Abu Dujana, also known as Humam al-Balawi, posed as an informant for the CIA

Dujana, also known as Humam al-Balawi, carried out the attack at the CIA's Camp Chapman base in 2009 which killed seven agents and a Jordanian official.

He successfully posed as a triple agent - working as an informer for both the CIA, the Jordanian government and the Taliban - to gain entry to the Afghanistan base where he detonated a suicide vest.

Dujana managed to get into the CIA 
base after arranging a meeting with the promise of information about the
 location of al-Qaeda's number two Ayman Al Zawahiri.

But once inside he detonated a suicide vest killing seven CIA agents and a Jordanian official.

It was the deadliest attack on the CIA in 25 years and led to a report which was heavily critical of the agency's work in Afghanistan.

One officer was quoted as branding US forces 'clueless' due to its lack of useful intelligence.

In the video, Britani is seen gesturing towards Dujana, saying he is destined for martyrdom, The Sun reports.

Suicide blast: The bombing at Camp Chapman by Dujana was one of the worst disasters in U.S. intelligence history

The Taliban announced his death 
earlier this week when another video was posted on jihadist websites of 
fighters killed in battle.

According
 to the US monitoring service SITE, Britani is named as Abbas and is 
pictured with wearing a black turban and with a thick black beard.

No details of when or how he died are given but it is believed he was killed by either a US drone attack or by Pakistani forces.

The video includes a photograph of al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden, who was shot dead by US Navy SEALs in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad in 2011.
