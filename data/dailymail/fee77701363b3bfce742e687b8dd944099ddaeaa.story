The first onesies were derided as little more than a romper suit for adults.

Made of cotton or polyester, the cheap fleecy suits were certainly warm and convenient for those unashamed to be seen looking like a supersize toddler.

However, they moved from the bedroom and lounge to become a feature of the high street, both as urban fashion statement and fun fancydress.

The luxurious onesie is made of pure cashmere wool, is available in black or grey and costs £199

Now, Marks & Spencer has created a luxury version in cashmere wool in time for Christmas, which comes with a price tag of £199.

It describes the cashmere version, which comes in black or grey as the ‘epitome of luxury’ and boasts ‘This sumptuous cashmere onesie will keep you snug and stylish from head to toe’.

The word onesie can be traced to the American baby goods manufacturer Gerber where it was used as a brand name to describe an all in one suit for toddlers.

This ad campaign, shot by Annie Leibowitz, was met with a mixed feelings from the public and press - and hasn't translated into any kind of sales lift. In fact, sales are down for clothing

The giant baby-grows were originally 
marketed as a thermal sleep-suit for adults, however they have become 
something of a fashion phenomenon over the last six years.

Sales
have taken off thanks to the endorsement of celebrities, with everyone 
from Hollywood A list stars like Brad Pit to TV  presenters Holly 
Willoughby and Amanda Holden, boy band One Direction and Olympian Tom 
Daley, seen wearing them in public.

Just as shell suits were worn by millions during the 1980s, so the onesie has come to define the fashion tastes of the current generation.

The shell suit faded from use after it was associated with what became known as the chav classes. M&S hopes that its popularity will last – at least until Christmas.

The company will be releasing its latest sales figures on Tuesday amid City speculation that sales of its women’s fashions have not seen the turnaround expected.

This will be a blow to the chain, which spent £5million on a new advertising campaign, featuring a cast that included Dame Helen Mirren and Tracey Emin, to promote its well-received autumn collection.
