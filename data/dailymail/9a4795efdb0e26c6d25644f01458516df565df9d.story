Regrets: Dame Stella Rimington told an audience at Henley Literary Festival of things she missed

MI5 must find a way of convincing the public that delving into private data is of paramount importance to national security or risk fueling the popularity of 'self-seeking twerps' Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, the former head of the organisation said.

Dame Stella Rimington, who was director general for MI5 between 1992 and 1996, said that terrorists are using increasingly sophisticated methods to communicate and conceal their plans, and so intelligence services must have the tools to keep one step ahead of them to avoid atrocities like the Kenyan mall massacre.

To do this, she said, they must be allowed to gather data on a large-scale - but the public need more assurances that this is necessary and is being carried out with proper supervision.

Speaking at the Henley Literary Festival on Monday, The Times reports the real-life former 'M', as saying: 'It is very important for our intelligence services to have the kind of oversight that people can have confidence in, so that we can be quite sure that in giving them these powers we know that they are being properly supervised and scrutinised in the way they use them.

'It may be that we need something more complex to convince the nation that the intelligence services are actually working on their behalf and not acting against them.'

She argued that many mistakenly believe that whistleblowers Assange and Snowden, who have released classified information to the public domain, are revealing something scandalous.

She added: 'I think adequate oversight could explain to us all that in a way that is not being explained and therefore Julian Assange and Edward Snowden would be seen for what they are - self-seeking twerps.'

The mother-of-two also told how she sometimes regrets juggling her hectic career with her young family, as she often regretted missing out on ‘sports day’ and ‘school plays’ because of the real life drama in the office.

Dedicated to her job, Dame Stella claimed she would later be wracked with guilt as she explained to her children why she hadn’t made an appearance.

Criticism: Dame Stella Rimington has labelled Wikileaks founder Julian Assange as a 'twerp' for releasing classified information into the public domain

She said: ‘I had so many moments where I would worry about being late for the sports day or late for the meeting because I was at sports day.

‘It was perpetual really, you take a day off because your child is in the school play and then some drama will happen at the office.

‘I still had to go home and explain to my child why I didn’t make it.

‘There were a number of things I missed - I wish I could go back too. ‘When they were growing up relied hugely on nannies and grannies.’

Now a thriller writer, Dame Stella was the first female and first public director general of MI5.

Dame Stella said women today still struggle to juggle their homes and their work, claiming she is disappointed and unimpressed by the lack of progression for helping working mothers.

She added: ‘I look at women in the work place now and I feel incredibly sad that the environment hasn’t changed more.

‘It shouldn’t still be difficult for women to juggle their family and their work life in 2013. The same problems shouldn’t face women today.

‘I thought by the time my daughters were to be mothers that they wouldn’t be faced with the this problem.

‘The government has previously promised to sort out child care and but it has failed.

‘There has been various promises that every borough, every town was going to have child care and they haven’t followed that up and it’s a great same.

‘It is still just as difficult as it was back in our day to have satisfactory arrangements.

‘And for our generation it is very sad to see and disappointing after everything we worked to change.

‘I really thought the world would have adapted better by now.

‘I think having women in senior positions is very important. Having a female Home Secretary is important. It is important women are in these positions to understand what women need in their homes.’

Dame Stella was invited to the festival to promote her latest novel The Geneva Trap.

A grandmother to five grandchildren she separated but never divorced from her husband John in 1984.
