A good soak in a hot bath is really all you need on a cold day.

Snow monkeys living near the resort of Yamanouchi, in the heart of central Japan's hot springs country, have taken to spending much of their time hanging out in the warm waters.

And while the macaques are already well prepared for Japan's harsh winters, boasting a thick coat of sand-coloured fur, their bright red faces seem most relaxed when they fall asleep in the warm pools.

The water in the naturally hot springs can get very hot and can reach temperatures of between 60 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (15-32 degrees Celsius).

Though these Japanese macaques can be found in other parts of the country, the monkeys here are considered unusual for their love of hot water - and are among the best-loved symbols of wild Japan.

At Jigokudani, or Hell's Valley, snow covers for approximately four months of the year with temperatures averaging minus ten degrees Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) during winter months.

Mr. Takizawa, one of five employees at Jigokudani Monkey Park, says the Japanese macaques have adopted a small build to survive such extreme weather conditions.

'The typical features of Japanese macaques are their short tails and small ears,' he says.

'These descriptions form the basis of Allen's rule - that animals in colder climates have shorter appendages particularly in temperatures below zero - which means their petite physical features total to a smaller surface area allowing them to be less exposed to the cold, thus being protected from forming frost bite.'

A lot of time is also spent grooming, which is important to strengthen bonds between the monkeys, so they carefully pick lice out of each other's fur coat

The close bonds forged amongst members of the snow monkey troop of approximately 160 attract many tourists. 

Despite its relatively remote location, roughly 100,000 visitors trek through the woods of Nagano each year to visit the macaques at the Jigokudani Wild Monkey Park.

And the tourists' favourite gadget - the camera - has evolved over the past half century.

Now everyone wants a selfie with a snow monkey, but it remains unclear whether the monkeys are keen to participate.

'When taking pictures with a smart phone, you stretch your arms out without realising, it is easy for people to stretch their arms out wide, which, from a monkey's point of view, this closely resembles the act of physical force,' says Takizawa.

And getting the primates to look at the camera is proving to be a whole other challenge, as American tourist Amber Kioninie has quickly realised.

And it seems as though what everyone really wants is a photo of the monkeys - up close and personal!

'I heard that the selfie stick was really big in Japan, so I bought my first one, and I'm trying to get my first selfie picture with the snow monkey,' she says. 'I've got a few, but I'm trying to get one with our faces looking at the camera.'

Jo and Troy, Australian tourists from Brisbane, are also adopting the selfie stick for their family photos.

'We're trying to take a selfie to make the monkey look like it's taking the selfie with us in it, if you know what I mean, but, it's not working out for us,' they explain, before continuing to perfect their shot.

However, there are concerns that some technologies are alarming to the monkeys. 

Drones, Takizawa says, are particularly risky as they resemble certain animals that the monkeys are wary of.

'Some people have even attempted to use drones, which have the capability of shooting video as it flies into the sky. 

'However, monkeys really dislike this kind of device, as for them it resembles animals that fly within close distance to them,' he warns.

The unusual creatures have long been considered a favoured symbol of wild Japan

'In Japan, there is a creature called Petaurista, which looks like a squirrel with a pair of wings and it flies between trees.

'When the monkeys see them they panic, and once they start panicking it also increases the risk of them injuring humans.'

The monkeys first learnt how to bathe when the small wooden inn at Korakukan opened to the public as a hot spa over one hundred years ago in 1884.

Tourists can still visit the spa today, and, if lucky, they may find a monkey bathing alongside them in the hot waters.
