For Rebecca Edmonds, the Air Force was her life.

After raised as a military kid, joining her school's Reserve Officers' Training Corps or ROTC and earning a full-ride Air Force scholarship to Marquette University, enlisting to serve her country was a dream.

What she didn't expect was that weeks before commissioned as a second lieutenant, with her own father in uniform proudly swearing her in, she'd become pregnant.

Proudest day: Pictured beside her father Capt Tony Edmonds in one of her proudest moments, Rebecca Edmonds graduated from Marquette University last year on full scholarship from the Air Force

Secret: It was at this ceremony the enrolling second lieutenant held a dangerous secret from her soon-to-be commanding officers, she was 13 weeks pregnant

'It was very special,' Ms Edmonds recalled to CNN of her college graduation ceremony in July of 2011 having completed a degree in nursing.

'I was so happy that [my parents] had an opportunity to come out and be a part of that ceremony and have him administer the oath of office to me as an active-duty officer,' she said of her father, Capt Tony Edmonds.

But when sitting down for one of her final counselling sessions with an officer before her commission, it was then her excitement turned to nervousness.

She had only just found out she was 13 weeks pregnant and no one outside of her immediate family and her boyfriend knew.

Fearful: With the military having been in her life from the start, following in her father's footsteps before joining ROTC, as seen centre, Ms Edmonds was scared to tell others of her pregnancy for fear of it ruining her dreams

Uncertainty: When an officer allegedly warned that if she became pregnant it would end badly, she said she felt trapped, though already knew she would never have an abortion

Shock: Ms Edmonds says she was shocked to hear that she had three options of getting married, giving her child to adoption or having an abortion, the last option she said only dictated in private to her

'He says, "I don't know what would happen to a cadet if she were to become pregnant. But I don't think it would be good. So just don't get pregnant,"' Ms Edmonds recalled of their conversation.

'He said that word for word to me. At 
that point, I thought, "OK, I don't think I have to tell anybody this,” 
she said, describing herself from then on rather 'scared.'

Moving forward, Ms Edmonds said she completed all of her physical and academic requirements.

Being a Catholic, she said abortion was never an option for her. Instead she began planning her move to Virginia to begin her service.

Once six months in, however, she felt she had to tell someone.

With her news, first expressed as no 
issue by her immediate commanders, she was accused of committing fraud 
for having not reported changes in her medical status, 'for example, 
pregnancy,' as her ROTC contract signed in 2007 read.

She was disenrolled.

Kicked out: Six months into her pregnancy with this little boy, Ms Edmonds revealed her news to her officers in effect dis-enrolling her while accusing her of fraud for having not reported it before

Fighting: Ms Edmonds, seen today holding her 10-month-old boy beside her boyfriend, says that she is fighting her removal under a military rule that refuses to enlist single mothers

Claiming to have questioned her officer who warned her of her ejection from the Air Force, she asked: 'Had I terminated the pregnancy before my commissioning, would I have been able to commission at that point?'

According to Ms Edmonds: 'He said, "well, technically, yes."

A spokesman for the Air Force to CNN denied knowing of that conversation taking place.'

Any such counselling would have been inappropriate and I have seen no evidence of any such discussion,' Maj. Joel Harper wrote to CNN. 'However, Ms. Edmonds' case is under review by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records.'

Debt to pay: Now having a $92,000 debt from student loans, her Air Force scholarship taken away, Ms Edmonds works as a pediatric nurse

Appealing to her congressman and hiring an attorney, Ms Edmonds learned that if she weren't a single mother before her commissioning, the Air Force's decision would have been far more lenient toward her.

As military readiness goes, single parents don't have flexibility to serve in all times of need, they stated.

'...she would have been able to commission if she were not a single parent, for example, if she were married, or had given the child up for adoption,' Air Force Colonel Kelly Goggin wrote to ms Edmonds' congressman.

Needed at home: The Air Force has said that single moms are not eligible for enrollment because of their inability to be ready in time of need

Mistake: She says that having her son Dominic, pictured, was never a mistake but hopes the military soon realizes that they are making one themselves

Today, working as a paediatric nurse, Ms Edmonds owes the military $92,000 for her tuition but says she's paying it in increments of $100 a month, with interest.

While the Air Force had been her life before, and to a large degree still is, she says it's now her 10-month old son, Dominic whom she says was never a mistake.

Still though she hopes like the recent changes allowing openly gay men and women to serve in the U.S. military, change will come or even be considered for her one day.

‘I believe a woman has the right to choose life, go on to serve and reach [her] full potential, including being an officer in the Air Force,’ Ms Edmonds told CNN.
