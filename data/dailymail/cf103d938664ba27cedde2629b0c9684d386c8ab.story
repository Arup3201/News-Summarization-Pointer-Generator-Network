'Single parent': Nicola Haighton, 25, a FHM High Street Honey claimed almost £4,000 in income support as a single parent, a court heard

A topless model was exposed as a benefits cheat when investigators found pictures of her wedding on Facebook.

Nicola Haighton, 25, pocketed almost £4,000 in income support by claiming she was a single parent.

The model, who has posed for FHM as a 'High Street Honey', failed to tell officials she got married in a lavish £6,000 ceremony in Clitheroe, Lancashire.

When she was confronted, she said she'd split from her husband just two days later.

The mother, who had a breast enhancement treatment to help with her modelling career, said she had 
married on a ‘whim’ and regretted it straight away.

However the model, from Accrington, Lancashire, pleaded guilty at Blackburn Magistrates Court to failing to notify a
change of circumstances which affected her entitlement to income 
support, council tax and housing benefit.

She was given a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay £100 costs.

The model was first investigated by officials at the Department of Work and Pensions when they received a tip-off she was about to marry brewery worker Daniel Riding.

They checked her Facebook page to 
discover pictures of the newlywed showing off a diamond engagement ring with 
the caption: 'My sparkler - 3 diamonds...meaning i love you!!!'

Another caption read: '18ct gold going into platinum - love love love it!!'

The officials then checked with the registrar’s 
office and noted the date for the £6,000 ceremony at  the luxurious Eaves Hall.

Shortly after the day investigators logged back onto the model's social media accounts and 
spotted she had opened a new account under the name Nicola Riding.

She
had also posted glamorous pictures of herself and her 25-year old husband being showered with 
confetti and cutting the wedding cake.

Happy day: Investigators from DWP found pictures of the newlyweds - such as this one - on Facebook

One relative posted a message saying: 'Love to you both xxxxx Wish we could do it all again absolutely fabulous day xxxxx.'

Catherine Allan, 
prosecuting, said the investigation began on July 5 last year after the 
benefits fraud office was informed that Haighton, of Oswaldtwistle, was 
living with her partner. He worked at Thwaites brewery but she was 
claiming as a single parent.

Miss
Allan said: 'They checked her Facebook page and there were photographs 
of them together advertising the fact they were engaged and due to be 
married.

'They contacted the 
registrar’s office and it was confirmed they were to be married on July 
19 and he was using the same address as her.'

She said the claim had resulted in an overpayment of £3,800.

Engagement: Investigators first became suspicious after the model posted this picture of a ring

Mitigating defence lawyer Richard
Prew said: 'She wanted everyone to think everything was going well and 
she felt under pressure from Mr Riding’s family to go through with the 
wedding.

'He came to live with
her on an ad-hoc basis but she accepts that when he was living there 
she should have disclosed it to the authorities.'

Speaking today, the mother-of-one, who is volunteering as teaching assistant at local school, insisted she had broken up with husband two weeks after the wedding.

They got back together, then broke up again after four months and yet they’re now back together again. She lives her husband, her inlaws and their son Keaton, three.

She said: 'It was horrendous going to court. I didn’t eat or sleep and I’m devastated to be branded a benefit cheat. To me I wasn’t falsely claiming because at the time we weren’t living together.

'I’ve nearly paid all the money back. Daniel doesn’t understand any of it. He says we’ll sort it out and it’ll all be alright.'

She added: 'The actual marriage ceremony was brilliant and if I could feel like that every day then life would be perfect. 

'But we split up like many others who have problems in their marriage. We were on and off and got married and then split up - it’s not all been plain sailing.

'We split up two weeks after we got married and my friends were saying "it’s the shortest marriage I’ve ever known".

'But
I’m not going to be a loser and embarrass myself and post news the 
break up all over Facebook - maybe if I had the DWP might have thought 
differently.

'But we’re back together now and we’re still married - and I just want to forget about the court case.'

The model is no stranger to media attention.

In
a newspaper interview five years ago Nicola - then an office 
administrator - told her chances of modelling fame and fortune had 
perked up after a boob job took her from a 32C to a 32E.

'A princess for a day': The model said her and her husband split two days after the £6,000 ceremony. However, speaking today she said they are now back together and live with their son Keaton, three

She landed a bit part on daytime TV show StarBar which was presented by Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan.

At the time Nicola said her boyfriend was supportive of her career move and she had done a variety of lingerie and topless work. She said: 'I’d like for all my hard work to pay off and get into glamour modelling.

'I did have some nasty comments because I’ve got fake boobs but I’m glad I did it because it kick-started my modelling career. I’m really excited about doing Richard and Judy because I can take three friends with me and we get to meet the celebrities.'
