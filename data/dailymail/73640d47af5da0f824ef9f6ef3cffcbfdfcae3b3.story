Rapist: Inmate Jacob Harvey, 20, allegedly raped his prison teacher in an empty classroom last year 

An Arizona prison teacher was  stabbed in the back of the head with a pen, choked, and thrashed against the floor as an inmate tore off all off her clothing and allegedly brutally raped her in an empty classroom where no one could hear her cries for help.

Arizona Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard blamed the alleged rape on the teacher saying 'should have known better' and is asking that a lawsuit be dropped against the Arizona Department of Corrections.

Jacob Harvey, 20, allegedly violently raped the victim in a prison classroom after taking an exam on January 20, 2014.

Harvey, a convicted rapist, remains in prison and is awaiting trial on rape, assault and related charges in the attack on the teacher. He has pleaded not guilty.

'Plaintiff is an ADOC (Arizona Department of Corrections) employee who routinely worked at the prison complex,' Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard wrote in a motion to dismiss the rape case on Monday.

'By being placed in a classroom at the complex, the officers were not placing Plaintiff in any type of situation that she would not normally face. The risk of harm, including assault, always existed at a prison like Eyman, he continued in his pitch to U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton.

The victim works at the ADOC as a teacher and she was scheduled to give an exam to seven convicted sex offenders on January 20 of last year.

Her classes usually take place in a heavily monitored visitation room but because of a special event in the prison she was sent with her class to an unmonitored classroom and given a police radio to use if she found herself in trouble, reports AZ Central.

The lawsuit claims that not once during the entire 90 minute exam did anyone check in with her over the radio if she was doing OK.

When the exam was finished, six of the men walked back unescorted to their dorm except for Jacob Harvey, 20.

Harvey is a convicted sex offender who less than a year before the alleged rape was sentenced to 30 years for breaking into a woman's house during the day and brutally raping her in front of her toddler.

The teacher claims she yelled for help but no one was able to hear her. When she attempted to use her radio it was tuned into a channel that the guards don't even use, she claims.

After she'd been allegedly battered and violated Harvey eventually allowed the teacher to call for help with a phone.

The civilian teacher is suing the ADOC for putting her in a room with convicted sex offenders without any security or form of reaching out for help.

'As a result of the brutal rape and assault, (the woman) suffered physical injuries, great fear for her life and well-being and severe and traumatic emotional distress with which she continues to struggle to this day,' her attorney, the victim's attorney, wrote.

Arizona Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Weisbard claims that because the victim was employed at the prison she should have understood the risks and cannot prove that she was put in danger by the prison establishment. 

The Attorney General said the woman, alone in the room with the convicted sex offender,  'could have done something about it.'

'Plaintiff wants to create an artificial impression that the ADOC officers knew she was in danger but she did not know,' he wrote. 'It makes no sense. Of course, if Plaintiff did appreciate the danger of her situation, as an employee, she could have done something about it.'

'How these defendants were chosen is a mystery at this point,' Weisbard told Bolton at Monday's hearing. He said in a written briefing that the teacher wasn't placed in an abnormal situation.

Bolton appeared to disagree, although she said she'd issue a ruling later. 'This was a dangerous situation — we know that,' she said.

The teacher's lawyer says there's nothing normal about his client being placed unguarded in a classroom with convicted sex offenders.

Attorney Scott Zwillinger told Bolton that Warden Ron Credio, a deputy warden and other prison officials didn't protect the teacher, who was neither armed nor trained to defend herself. 

'They failed in their duties, and they created the situation that led the harm to my client,' he said.

The teacher also is suing prison health care provider Corizon Health Inc. The company's lawyers also are asking that the case be dismissed and deny wrongdoing.

The teacher sat with her lawyer in court while her parents watched from the visitor's gallery. A claim she made against the state before filing the lawsuit sought $4 million.

In a September interview with the AP, she said she primarily blamed Corrections Director Charles Ryan for putting her in danger. She said rampant understaffing meant no one checked on her while she was in the classroom.

'Safety's got to come before everything, and there's just this attitude that we have the number of staff we need because we say we do,' she said.

Ryan has not responded to requests for comment, but a prison spokesman has called the rape 'a cowardly and despicable crime, for which the inmate is rightfully facing prosecution' and said safety is always paramount.
