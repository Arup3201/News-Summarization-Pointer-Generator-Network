For most of us there has not been anything terribly positive about the weeks of rain this winter, but  for Missy the zoo raccoon it has meant freedom.

Missy, who is 18 months old, has dug her way out of her enclosure after the deluge softened the surrounding ground â€“ and has disappeared.

The public were asked to look out for the animal but warned not to try to catch her because she may bite.

On the run: Missy the raccoon burrowed out of her enclosure at Tropiquaria in Somerset after wet weather softened the surrounding ground

Chris Moiser, zoological director at 
Tropiquaria in Washford, Somerset, said: 'The sad thing is that we have had raccoons in that enclosure for two years with no trouble whatsoever,' Mr Moiser said.

'It is only with the recent flooding that the ground has softened sufficiently for her to dig out.

'We
 have had a number of problems with the recent flooding and have had to 
evacuate some animals from outside enclosures, but we really thought 
that the raccoons were safe.

'Missy will not have any problems in surviving in the English climate but it does worry us that she is out.'

Mr Moiser said Missy's partner, six-year-old Rocky, had been left extremely upset by her departure.

He added: 'If you see her, could you please contact me on 07751 363198 and we will be out for her straightaway.

'Do not try and handle her as she may bite - just observe her from a distance. If she does enter an outbuilding, if possible do lock her in.'
