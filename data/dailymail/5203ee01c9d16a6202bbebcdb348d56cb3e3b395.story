One of 200 schoolgirls abducted by Islamist Boko Haram rebels in the northeastern Nigerian village of Chibok was freed this week, police and a parent of some of the other missing girls said on Thursday.

Boko Haram militants took the girls from a secondary school in the village near the Cameroon border in April.

The case of the abducted school girls drew global attention, magnified by a #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign that drew in celebrities including Michelle Obama and Angelina Jolie.

Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan told the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday that authorities were still working to free the girls.

Jonathan has been criticized at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping in the rural northeast and for his inability to quell the violence by the Islamist militant group, whose name means 'Western education is forbidden.'

'Although it has been over three months since they were abducted, we have never relented in our efforts to set them safely free,' Jonathan told the 193-member world body.

'Together with our partners, we are working assiduously to free our daughters and reunite them with their families,' he said. 'We shall not waiver until we end this mindless war on the innocent and bring all the perpetrators to justice.'

A year-old intensive military operation against Boko Haram has so far failed to crush the rebels, whose struggle for an Islamic state in largely Muslim northern Nigeria has killed thousands since it was launched in 2009.

However, Nigeria's military on Wednesday claimed for the first time that Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, was dead, as it said troops had killed a lookalike who had been posing as the militant commander.
