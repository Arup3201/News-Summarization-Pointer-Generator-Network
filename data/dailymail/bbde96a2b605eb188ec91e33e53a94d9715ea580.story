As clouds of cotton swirl around him, a labourer - protected by headscarf and glasses - plays his part to boost Afghanistan's economy.

He is one of the workers in the country's first synthetic fibre manufacturing plant, which opened last Tuesday.

The Paktika Shaheen factory, in Kabul, was set up with $2million of investment from the U.S. and will initially provide employment for around 300 workers.

Surrounded by swirls of artificial cotton, a labourer plays his part to boost Afghanistan's economy, at the country's first synthetic fibre manufacturing plant

The Paktika Shaheen factory, in Kabul, was set up with $2m of investment from the U.S.

The factory will initially provide employment for around 300 workers but the aim is to eventually double it

At the opening ceremony, factory chairman Haji Sheikh Mohammad told Wadsam News it would recycle plastic bottles to make fibre for artificial cotton and carpets.

And according to officials, the site can produce seven tonnes of fibre per day, with a view to this rising to 20 tonnes within a month.

Their long-term plan is for Paktika to employ 600 people.

'The $2million cash injection in the factory shows that our backers are willing to continue investing in the country and help in the reconstruction process,' said chairman of the Afghanistan Investment Support Agency, Wafiullah Iftekhar.

Given the fragile infrastructure of the war-torn country, there are concerns about a potential shortage of electricity, and land, to keep the plant operational throughout the year

The Afghanistan Investment Support Agency has assured the plant owners it will do all it can to keep the factory functioning

However, given the fragile infrastructure of the war-torn country, there are concerns about a potential shortage of electricity, and land, to keep the plant operational throughout the year.

'We do not have ownership of the land, 
it has been taken on lease. The land should be given to us,' Sheikh Mohammad told Tolo News.

'We spent 
money to set up the factory, and if the factory is moved somewhere else, 
we will suffer heavy losses. We are also facing a serious shortage of 
electricity.'

The Investment Support Agency has assured the owners it will do all it can to keep the factory functioning.

Paktika's opening comes as U.S. 
Secretary of State John Kerry was in Kabul on Friday trying to negotiate
the terms of a U.S.-Afghan security agreement that would govern the 
activities of American forces in Afghanistan after the NATO-led combat 
mission ends at the close of next year.

The U.S.-led international coalition plans to withdraw its troops by the end of 2014, and America and its allies are considering keeping a small residual force in the country to train and assist Afghan security forces and go after the remnants of Al Qaeda

The U.S.-led international coalition plans to withdraw its troops by the end of 2014, and America and its allies are considering keeping a small residual force in the country to train and assist Afghan security forces and go after the remnants of Al Qaeda.

But almost a year of negotiations on the deal have failed to yield an agreement - and it's possible the two sides will never produce one.

Without the United States on board, it is unlikely NATO or any of its allies will keep troops in Afghanistan. Germany has already indicated it will not commit the 800 soldiers it has promised.

Afghan president Hamid Karzai has called a tribal meeting of Afghan elders - known as Loya Jirga - for next month to discuss the state of the U.S.-Afghan agreement and advise him on what to do.

The Taliban, meanwhile, condemned a unanimous U.N. Security Council vote to extend the mandate of the NATO-led force in Afghanistan for the last time before it hands over total responsibility for security to Afghan forces at the end of next year.

The resolution adopted by the council said the situation in Afghanistan 'still constitutes a threat to international peace and security.'
