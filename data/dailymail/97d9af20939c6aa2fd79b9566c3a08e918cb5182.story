A Lithuanian man who squirted three neighbours in the face with CS spray for playing loud music insisted such behaviour was ‘normal’ in his home country.

Arunas Kastentinavicius, 26, approached the two women and one man in Hanley, Staffordshire, to complain about the volume of their music.

They agreed to turn it down, but he returned to their door an hour later to make the same demand.

The father-of-one said he used the gas because he ‘didn’t want to hit a woman’.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court (pictured) heard how the man sprayed the two women and man in the face with gas after asking them to turn their music down

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard the three victims suffered burning and choking sensations and one of the women was taken to hospital.

Kastentinavicius pleaded guilty to possessing a prohibited weapon and to three charges of assault.

Heather Chamberlin, prosecuting, said he defended his actions, telling police it was ‘normal’ behaviour in his home country.

‘Kastentinavicius said he knocked on the door and the women were shouting at him, so he sprayed them with CS spray. It is normal in Lithuania,’ she said.

The man said he did not know the gas was illegal in the UK (file image)

‘The cylinder … had an 11 per cent harmful content, as opposed to spray used by police which has 5 per cent … He had asked his mother to send the spray over from Lithuania. 

'He didn’t realise it was illegal.’

Kastentinavicius was given a six-month suspended sentence with 100 hours’ unpaid work and ordered to pay each victim £200.

Kevin Moorlock, defending, told the court: 'The victims still live in the same block of flats and there has been no further incidents.

'He has one son. He had worked a long day and became emotional.

'In terms of the pepper spray, he says the cannister is available to buy in normal stores in Lithuania.

'It is recognised as forbidden in Germany, but he didn’t think to research if it was banned here. He has learned a harsh lesson.'

Sentencing him, Judge David Mason said: 'This was a very unpleasant incident.

'You went to the door of these three people and deliberately sprayed in their faces, causing a very unpleasant injury.'
