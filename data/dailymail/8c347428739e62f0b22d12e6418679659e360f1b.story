Movie monster King Kong has been pictured at the top of a skyscraper in the Australian city of Melbourne, clutching a terrified and beautiful blonde in his gigantic paw.

Fortunately for the city's populace, the vertigo-enducing image is a publicity stunt for a new musical production of King Kong, which open's next month at the Regent Theatre.

The furry hand was hoisted to the 88th floor of Eureka Tower, a 297.3-metre skyscraper located in the Southbank precinct of Melbourne.

Vertigo: Stunt expert Leigh-Anne Vizer is held by a giant King Kong hand 300 metres above the city of Melbourne during a PR stunt

Kong's 'victim' was aerial stunt actress Leigh-Anne Vizer, who even screamed to stay in character as Ann Darrow, portrayed by Fay Wray in the original 1933 film and Naomi Watts in the 2005 remake.

The hand had been constructed around the Eureka building management unit, used to clean the tower's windows, and Ms Vizer was lowered from the roof in the hand.

The brave stunt-lady stayed suspended, 300m above the ground, for about 10 minutes and threw a variety of poses for the assembled throng of photographers before being taken back to the roof.

Day and night: The production is set to open next month and features state-of-the-art puppetry, as well as musical numbers

Amazingly, she once again was strapped into the monstrous paw for a second hair-raising aerial excursion at night.

The hand will remain at Eureka Tower for the next nine months to celebrate the opening of the musical, reports the Herald Sun.

The musical has been five years in the making and features a cast of more than 40 actors, singers, dancers and circus performers, and a team of puppeteers who will bring to life one of the most technologically-advanced puppets in the world - a one-tonne, six-metre tall silverback gorilla.

The story revolves around a film crew that goes to a tropical island for an exotic location shoot and discovers a colossal gorilla who takes a shine to their female blonde star.

Blockbuster: The film was remade in 2005 and featured actress Naomi Watts in the role of Ann Darrow. It was directed by triple Academy Award winner Peter Jackson
