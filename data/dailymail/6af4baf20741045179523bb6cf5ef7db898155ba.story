Racist graffiti about a black pupil was daubed on the walls of his school hours after he died in an apparent suicide.

The body of Erick Maina, who was praised as a role model and inspiration by teachers, was found at his home on Saturday morning.

That night vile insults were sprayed on buildings at his school and in a nearby park.

Erik Maina was a popular and well-respected pupil at Maricourt Catholic High School, which organised a vigil 

The messages included a reference to the Ku Klux Klan, the word ‘n*****’ and Erick’s name alongside a swastika.

Two teenagers were arrested and have pleaded guilty in court to racially aggravated criminal damage.

Kenyan-born Erick, 15, complained of racial abuse at a gym last year and officers are investigating whether he had suffered any more in the run-up to his death.

His mother, Jane, 45, told the Mail: ‘This is a very hard time for me. There are lots of questions running through our minds.’

Erick had posted ‘Bye’ on his Facebook account on the morning of his death.

Brendan McLoughlin, the head of Erick’s school – Maricourt Catholic High in Maghull, Liverpool – said he was ‘sickened and shocked’ to find the graffiti on Sunday morning.

Mr McLoughlin added: ‘After collaboration with the police, along with the site team, I removed the graffiti to ensure none of our pupils would have to witness such material.’

He said Erick was immensely popular, adding: ‘We’re all absolutely shocked about what’s happened.

‘It’s so tragic for a young boy who had such great prospects. He had a great future.’

Erik, who is originally from Nigeria, was found dead at his home after he posted the word 'Bye' on Facebook 

It is understood that no allegations of bullying – racist or otherwise – were made by Erick at the school, where he was studying for his GCSEs. 

Yesterday, James Coleman, 18, of Netherton, and a 17-year-old youth from Bootle, who cannot be named, were remanded in custody after they admitted writing the graffiti.

They will be sentenced at South Sefton Magistrates’ Court next month. Neither attends Maricourt High.

Claire Hoban, 15, who was Erick’s prom date at the school, tweeted after his death: ‘We had plans to do loads, you’re still my prom date Erick.’

Joanne Gregory, a neighbour, expressed her disgust about the graffiti, writing on Facebook: ‘His lovely parents are going through enough, they do not need any more hurt such as this.’
