French MPs paid an emotional tribute to the 17 Parisians killed in last week's terror attacks with a spontaneous rendition of La Marseillaise.

All members stood up in the Assemblée Nationale, France's equivalent to the House of Commons, and started singing the national anthem following a minute's silence during Tuesday's session.

The tribute was the first time the Marseillaise had been sung in the French Parliament since the end of the First World War in 1918.

Speaking in Parliament after the tribute, France's prime minister demanded tougher anti-terrorism measures in the wake of the Paris attacks.  

 'We must not lower our guard, at any time,' Prime Minister Manuel Valls told Parliament, adding that 'serious and very high risks remain.'

MPs lined up overwhelmingly behind the government, giving repeated standing ovations to Valls' rousing, indignant address.

Lawmakers  then voted 488-1 to extend French airstrikes against Islamic State extremists in Iraq.

'France is at war against terrorism, jihadism, and radical Islamism,' Valls declared. 'France is not at war against Islam.'

The day after the emotional A top leader of Yemen's Al Qaeda branch has claimed responsibility for last week's attack on a Paris newspaper when two masked gunmen killed 12 people, including much of the weekly's editorial staff and two police officers.

Nasr al-Ansi, a commander of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as the branch is known, appeared in an 11-minute internet video, saying that the massacre at Charlie Hebdo was in 'vengeance for the prophet'.

Al-Ansi said France belongs to the 'party of Satan' and warned of more 'tragedies and terror'. He said Yemen's Al Qaeda branch 'chose the target, laid out the plan and financed the operation'.

He described the gunmen who carried out the massacre as 'heroes of Islam' in the 11-minute rant.

The news follows a survivors' edition of the Charlie Hebdo magazine selling out within hours of going on sale in France, with the print run increased to five million copies.
