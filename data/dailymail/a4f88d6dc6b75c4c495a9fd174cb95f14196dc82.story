A violent New Year's Eve brawl on a London Tube train has been captured on video.

Five French men have been arrested after the fight at Old Street station on the Northern Line train.

A short clip, made up of segments from Vine videos, shows a row break out in the doorway of the train carriage.

Brawl: The passengers are crammed inside the tube carriage

Riot: A redheaded girl shouts for people to call the police

Shouting: swarms of people outside the start shouting, jumping and waving their arms in the air

A redheaded girl in a white coat is standing in the carriage and shouts for people on the platform for someone to call the police before she falls into the side of the tube carriage.

As the two groups appear to argue on the packed carriage, swarms of people outside the start shouting, jumping and waving their arms in the air.

Some men on the crowded platform and leaning out of carriage doors then start shouting 'fight, fight' before clapping and cheering as people inside the carriage seem to be struggling and swearing.

Revellers clutching drinks were pushed around the platform as the train was held up while the situation was calmed down.Â

The apparent altercation ended when someone was dragged away from the doors and another clip, which was posted by Mathew Davis who says he got the clips from Daniel Lismore, shows two men talking to London Underground staff in the ticket hall.

A spokesman for British Transport Police said: 'Officers from BTP and the Metropolitan Police Service attended the incident.

'Five male French nationals aged between 20 and 26 have been arrested in connection with the incident and bailed until Thursday, 6 March pending further inquiries.'
