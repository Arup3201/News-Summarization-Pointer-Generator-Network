The gloves worn by Muhammad Ali in his 1971 fight with Joe Frazier have been sold for £237,000. 

An anonymous bidder bought the gloves at an auction in Cleveland, Ohio. The bout, dubbed ‘The Fight of the Century’, saw Frazier beat Ali by a unanimous decision to become the undisputed world heavyweight champion.  

At the time, Frazier was the heavyweight world champion, a title that had been stripped from Ali four years previously after he was banned from boxing for refusing to enlist in the Vietnam draft.

History: The gloves were used by the boxing hero when he took to the ring against Frazier in March 1971

After successfully fighting a five-year prison term handed down in 1967, Ali had been granted a license to box again in late 1970 and set his career back on track with easy wins against Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena.

The victories paved the way for his first fight against reigning champ Frazier, once a friend but now a bitter enemy.

Ali viewed Frazier as the poster boy for the pro-Vietnam movement and the two exchanged increasingly barbed words in the run-up to the fight.

Frazier was the most intimidating fighter at the time and the match, in New York's Madison Square Garden on March 8, 1971, was one of the most anticipated in the sport's history.

The two boxers unleashed their animosity towards one another in the ring but it was Frazier who emerged on top and after Ali was floored in the 15th round the bout was awarded to Frazier.

It was Ali's first ever professional 
loss and set the stage for a thrilling rematch against Frazier in New 
York in 1974 and the series decider, the Thrilla in Manilla, the 
following year, both of which Ali won.

Hefty: The gloves fetched £237,000 from an anonymous bidder at auction in Cleveland, Ohio

Following the 1971 fight Ali's gloves were cut off his wrists after the match by his trainer, Angelo Dundee, and they remained in his private collection until his death in February 2012.

The sweat-stained Everlast gloves, in good condition but with signs of discolouring where the tape was, were then purchased by a private collector.

Experts have tipped them to fetch upwards of 300,000 pounds when they go under the hammer in the Heritage Auctions sale in Cleveland, Ohio.

And they could challenge the current world record for boxing memorabilia set in February this year when a pair of Ali's gloves from his 1964 heavyweight victory against Sonny Liston sold for 540,000 pounds.

Included in the sale is a signed letter from Angelo Dundee confirming the provenance of the gloves.

Chris Ivy, director of sports at Heritage, said: 'These gloves represent so much more than just a sporting moment in history.

'They were the tools of one of the greatest ever sportsmen but they also represent a pivotal point in Ali's career.

'Both he and Frazier were undefeated when they stepped into the ring together for their first fight in March 1971 so there was a lot riding on it and a lot of hype surrounding it.

'There were strong political overtones too - Frazier was seen as being part of the pro-Vietnam establishment while Ali had refused the draft due to his religious views.

Safe keeping: The gloves remained with his trainer Angelo Dundee until his death in 2012

'All this sent people into a frenzy and led to an epic battle that lasted the full 15 rounds.

'Ali lost the fight but it laid the groundwork for two rematches which are now legendary.

'You can definitely tell the gloves have taken some punishment but they are in pretty good condition.

'There is every chance that the sale of these gloves could break the world record that was set last year - they are just as significant.'

The auction will take place on July 31.
