He will always be best-known for his pointy ears and devotion to logic as Mr Spock - one of science fiction's towering characters.

But the warp engine of Leonard Nimoy's on-screen ability in the Star Trek movies has sent more than just his own career into orbit.

After the star died this Friday at the age of 83, and tributes poured in, some credited the sci-fi legend with helping them secure a life among the stars.

Unlikely start: Sex and the City star Kim Cattrall posted this picture of her appearing in Star Trek VI: Undiscovered country as a female Vulcan crewmember, alongside Leonard Nimoy's Spock. The quotation is taken from Shakespeare's Anthony and Cleopatra, in which Cattrall starred onstage

RIP: Nimoy died on Friday from lung disease, his family said. He is pictured about in 2013 at the premiere of Star Trek: Into Darkness

Moving on: Cattrall, right in 2010, did not take her famous Sex and the City Role, left, until years after her turn on Star Trek

Kim Cattrall led the way, posting on Twitter that Nimoy had been her 'mentor, champion and friend'.

It was accompanied by a picture of the pair, dressed in Federation uniform, onscreen in 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,' which premiered in 1991.

Cattrall played Valeris in the film, a Vulcan protege who was taken under Spock's wing - but turned out to be an assassin who betrayed the crew.

Years later Cattrall was cast as Samantha in 'Sex and the City,' which began in 1998, a role which eventually won her a Golden Globe.

Other stars to have received a career mind meld from Nimoy include Cheers actress Kirstie Alley, most famous for her role as Rebecca Howe in Cheers.

Alley played Saavik - a Vulcan officer and precursor to Cattrall's Valeris - in the iconic 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.'

The role was her first in a feature film, and came years before the move to her Emmy-winning Cheers role.

Others best-known from beyond the Star Trek universe to share credits with Nimoy include Christopher Lloyd, who played Doc Brown in the Back to the Future films.

Lloyd appeared as 'Klingon Commandrer Kruge in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock' a year before the first Back to the Future film. Nimoy directed The Search for Spock, as well as appearing briefly on-screen.

Dozens of other celebrities also paid tribute to Nimoy - including erstwhile co-stars William Shatner and George Takei.

Shatner, who played Captain Kirk, said: 'I loved him like a brother. We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love.'

Takei, who played Hikaru Sulu, tweeted: 'Rest in peace with the stars, my dear friend.'

Zachary Quinto, who took up the character of Spock in the recent Hollywood reboot of Star Trek, also posted a touching message.

He wrote: 'I love you profoundly my dear friend and I will miss you everyday.' 

Even President Barack Obama got involved. In a White House statement, he said: 'Leonard was Spock. Cool, logical, big-eared and level-headed, the center of Star Trek’s optimistic, inclusive vision of humanity’s future.

'I loved Spock'.

Old-school: Nimoy's classic screenmates, including William Shatner, center as Captain Kirk, paid tribute to him

Nimoy's son Adam Friday confirmed the actor, adored by Trekkies all over the world, died at his home in Los Angeles.

He said the cause of his father's death was end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 

Nimoy was catapulted to fame for his portrayal of the pointy-eared science officer Mr Spock in the cult TV series, first launched in the 60s and followed by a string of films.

His half-human, half-Vulcan character was the calm counterpoint to William Shatner's often-emotional Captain Kirk in a series that attracted a worldwide fan base.

Although Nimoy followed the original 1966-69 Star Trek run with a notable career as an actor, director, writer and photographer, in the public's mind he would always be Spock.

The actor left a poignant final message for fans on his Twitter account last Sunday, including a reference to his famous sign-off 'Live Long And Prosper'.
