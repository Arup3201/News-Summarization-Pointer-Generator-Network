A man died in a suspected shooting that saw an entire village sealed off by armed police and led to three arrests this afternoon.

Officers from Humberside Police were called to Melton, a small village just west of Hull, at around 5pm after reports from the public of a disturbance, possibly involving a   gun.

When police arrived at the scene one man was found to have suffered serious wounds. He was treated by paramedics at the scene but they could not save him.

The entire village of Melton, close to Hull in East Yorkshire, was sealed off after a suspected shooting where a man died

A second man was also found to be hurt and was treated at the scene. His injuries were not thought to be life-threatening.

According to reports, armed police were stationed outside a local hospital where the man may be receiving treatment.

Humberside Police said three men were arrested at the scene and were helping with inquiries. A force spokesman said: 'Police were called to a residential property in the Melton Old Road area of Melton at around 1700 this evening following reports of a disturbance   possibly involving a firearm.

'On arrival, officers found one man at the address who had suffered serious injuries. He was treated at the scene by paramedics but sadly pronounced deceased.

'A second man was also found at the address having been injured, however his injuries are not life threatening.

'Following initial inquiries, three men were arrested in connection with the incident.

'A large area around the scene at Melton Old Road remains closed at this time as officers conduct inquiries in order to establish the circumstances which lead to the incident.

'I would advise the public to avoid the area at this time as there may be some disruption while the incident is cleared.' According to social media, up to 40 armed officers flooded into the village, which was partially sealed off by police.

Humberside Police initially released few details of the incident, save to warn drivers that they faced long delays. Alison Peck, the new chairman of Welton Parish Council - the neighbouring village - who lives in Melton, said: 'It's very quiet, quite rural and normally very peaceable.'

'We are a small village of round about 300 houses with a large secondary school just around the corner.' She said police cordons were still in place tonight.
