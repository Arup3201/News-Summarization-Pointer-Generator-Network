A Georgia high school student who blitzed the AAU basketball circuit this summer despite having just one arm has now committed to play for the University of Florida.

Zach Hodskins, a 6-4, 200-pound guard from Milton High School, will be a preferred walk-on for the Gators, not a scholarship player, he revealed on the weekend.

'It's always been my dream growing up,' Hodskins, who's originally from Lexington, Kentucky, told ESPN. 'I never expected it to be like this, but the hard work has paid off. I'm ecstatic I'm going to be a Florida Gator.'

Star: Zach Hodskins, a 6-4, 200-pound guard from Milton High School, will be a preferred walk-on for the Gators, not a scholarship player, he revealed on the weekend

Dream come true: 'It's always been my dream growing up,' Hodskins, who's originally from Lexington, Kentucky, told ESPN this week

Hodskins was born without the lower half of his left arm but didn't let that stop him succeed on the basketball court.

He was spotted last summer by an assistant coach with the Gators who was scouting another hopeful, Fox News reported.

Being a 'preferred walk-on' means Hodskins will be guaranteed to make the roster, but will not receive a full scholarship.

His incredible story of overcoming adversity has inspired the likes of Clippers guard JJ Redick and Beyonce.

And even Michael Jordan tweeted about him after he revealed the good news.

'One-handed basketball player, Zach Hodskins, has committed to Florida! He is unreal! #MustSee,' the basketball legend tweeted.

But he said he wants to prove his place on the team and not just be a feel-good story.

'I'm coming on as a preferred walk-on, but I'll be treated like every other player,' Hodskins said to ESPN. 'If I work hard, Coach Donovan told me I'll have a chance to play.'

One YouTube video shows Hodskins hit jump shots in a high school gym and wow the crowd with his ball skills.

'I love to see people watch me for the first time, with the shock on their face,' he said.

Weighing his options: Hodskins was also offered spots at other universities but chose the Gators

But it's taken time to get to that 
point. He said the hardest challenge when he was younger was getting 
over how others looked at him.

'It's
a really mental thing,' he said. 'I just had to push through that; know
that they're only looking at me because they're curious.'

He told ESPN that he always understood his path in life.

'You
know, God wanted me to do this and I fell in love with basketball and I
just took it all the way. I never gave up and that's how I reach out to
kids,' he said.

The 
senior from Alpharetta was selected as one of the most impressive 
college prospects at the ScoutsFocus All American Camp this past June.

As well as the University of Florida showing interest, it was reported in August that both the University of Alabama-Birmingham and Birmingham Southern considered offering Hodskins a full scholarship to play on their teams.

He also had an offer from the University of Kentucky but felt his best chance to play was in Gainesville.

'At Florida, I'm going to have every opportunity to get on the floor and play,' he told ESPN. 'The situation was different at Kentucky.'

Hodskins has had to deal with the missing piece of him his whole life. He was born perfectly healthy in February 1996 save the lower part of his left arm.

'He was born a fully healthy kid just without his other hand. No real reason,' Hodskin's father Bob Hodskins told the Courier Journal in August. 'We knew that we had to accept it and just live.

Hodskins more than accepted the condition - he embraced it and overcame it.

When started at Milton High School in
August, his teammates were curious about his arm and what it was going 
to be like playing alongside him

'Everyone wanted to know how I
lost my arm, which is nothing new,' Hodskins said. 'So I got a serious face
and I told them that it got bitten off by a shark. The look on their 
faces was priceless. I like that story; makes me sound tougher.'

His
teammate Jazz Felton was surprised to learn that Hodskins would be joining 
his high school team, but watching YouTube clips of his teammate gave 
him a taste of Hodskins' playing style.

'I
was amazed at the clips, but it wasn't until I played with him that I 
really knew he was a great player,' he said. 'He can really, really 
play. Not "for a guy with one arm" kind of play either. He does 
everything really well, but he can shoot lights out.'

Hodskins said he was often underestimated on the court but he used that to his advantage.

He
said most of the time his opponents try to force him to the left, and he loved that because he had practiced his counter attacks.

'I
know that people who don't know me sleep on me when I walk on the 
court,' he said.

'They don't think I can play or they don't know what to
think, but it's when I hit those first few shots or when I go by them 
is when they wake up. That's when they start playing me hard. That's 
what I love. I know that I've just earned their respect. That's all I 
want.'
