The son or daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will have not only the blood of actual British royalty running through his or her veins, but also the (slightly more diluted) blood of American music royalty. And Hollywood royalty, too.

It has been revealed that the Royal baby, who will be known as HRH Prince or Princess [first name] of Cambridge, will be a distant relative of celebrity couples Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, and Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, and all their respective children.

The baby prince or princess, believed to be due on Saturday, 13 July, will be 23rd cousins twice-removed with Beyonce's baby Blue Ivy Carter.

Records show that the future royal's 23rd cousin twice-removed is Blue Ivy Carter, the daughter of musical couple Beyoncé Knowles and Jay-Z, through Blue Ivy's relation to the Queen through French royal heritage.

Celine Dion's three children will be 26th cousins thrice-removed, while the three children of Jennifer Garner and Oscar-winner Ben Affleck will be the closest relatives - 11th cousins, due to family lines connecting through Affleck and Princess Diana.

And Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's six children will be 27th cousins to the baby, linked through both parents' family ancestry.

Debra Chatfield, a family historian at findmypast.co.uk said: 'It's long been said that the USA and UK have a special relationship, and that is certainly the case between Hollywood's elite and the Royal Family. 

'The closest relation we found to the Hollywood children was the late Princess Diana'

'The closest relation we found to the Hollywood children was the late Princess Diana.

'Diana's ancestry includes a number of early settlers on the east coast of the USA that can be traced right up to the modern day.

'There are 1.6 billion records on findmypast.co.uk that people can search through, so they can trace their own family ties. There is always a chance people may find their own Hollywood connection.'
