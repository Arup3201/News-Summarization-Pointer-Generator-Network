Former World Heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield has starred in the state of Georgia's video campaign to tackle road rage.  

The short film shows an angry driver of a pickup truck exit his car to confront the initially unidentified driver of an SUV that had pulled out from a driveway to cut him off. 

The incensed trucker, garbed in a beige gillet and light blue jeans, slams his fist on the bonnet of the SUV, prompting Holyfield to reveal himself as the driver.

Upon being faced by the towering physique of the two-time IBF and WBA World Heavyweight champ, the maddened motorist's road rage soon subsides as he apologises profusely and backs away. 

The video then cuts to an ominous warning, 'Avoid road rage. You never know who you might run into.'

The inspiration for the scene is understood to have come from a real incident in Holyfield's life when he was still an amateur fighter.

52-year-old Holyfield won two WBA and IBF World Heavyweight titles over the course of his boxing career
