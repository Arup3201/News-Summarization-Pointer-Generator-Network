Ally McCoist's temperature may be rising in the managerial market right now after being linked to the vacant manager's job at Crystal Palace - but he found the perfect way to cool down.

The Rangers boss gracefully accepted the nomination from Allan McGregor to undertake the Ice Bucket Challenge in aid of Motor Neurone Disease.

And he decided to keep his nominations close to home - by naming three other Scottish managers.

Soaked: Rangers boss Ally McCoist undertook Ice Bucket Challenge after being linked to the Crystal Palace job

Calm before the storm: McCoist looks ahead and nominates Sir Alex Ferguson before the challenge begins

Stepping up: Two Rangers coaches pick up a huge bin full of water and prepare to pour it over McCoist's head

Tipping point: The two members of staff begin to pour water over McCoists head as he sit and takes it

Drenched: Freezing cold water continues to descend on the Rangers boss as he sits there and gets wet

Aftermath: McCoist sits shivering and looking down in his sodden training clothes after the challenge

Sir Alex Ferguson, Walter Smith and Graeme Souness were those players who McCoist has asked to douse themselves in freezing cold water. 

The Ice Bucket Challenge craze originated in the United States with the intention of raising money for the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Association. 

ALS, also known as  Motor Neurone Disease, attacks the spinal cord and can lead to speech difficulties, muscle spasms and paralysis. It affects around 30,000 people in the US and 5,000 in the UK.
