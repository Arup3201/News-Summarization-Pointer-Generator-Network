Torrid conditions have taken a toll on the smaller boats on the opening night of the Sydney to Hobart race. 

New American flyer Comanche was leading three of her fellow super maxis, while Comanche, which impressively won the early dash to be first through Sydney Heads, was around two nautical miles ahead of seven-times line honours winner Wild Oats XI.

Two other supermaxis, Perpetual LOYAL and Ragamuffin 100, were a further three-and-a-half and six miles adrift, respectively. 

Thousands of people lined the Sydney Harbour foreshore and hundreds of spectator boats were on hand for the countdown to the 70th blue water classic.

The fifth supermaxi, RIO 100, struggled in the heavy conditions and was lagging in eighth, with Giacomo, Black Jack and Alive, filling fifth to seventh spots, respectively. 

Of the retired yachts, 1997 line honours winner Brindabella was the biggest boat and highest profile casualty.   

Barely two hours had elapsed before news of the first casualties emerged.

Sydney-based boats Bear Necessity (rudder damage) and Accessional Coarse Language Too (steering damage) and Victorian yacht Tina of Melbourne (hull damage) were among the first wave of stricken vessels to stop racing.

Triton (forestay damage), Wiilyama (torn mainsail), Brindabella and Last Tango (sail damage) were later additions to the mounting list.

While the southerlies were expected to lash the fleet throughout the night, significantly higher conditions were forecast to arrive at some stage of Saturday morning.

Among the early frontrunners on handicap were British 68-footer Titania of Cowes, NSW 40-footer Ariel and New Zealand Volvo 70 boat Giacomo.

The Queen's granddaughter, Zara Phillips, spent Friday morning before the race at the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia.

She lead a contingent of celebrities who also gathered to farewell competitors as the Boxing Day countdown to the 1pm race start drew closer. 

Surfing champ Sally Fitzgibbons was front and centre after being asked to sail on board Perpetual LOYAL with owner and skipper Anthony Bell. 

They were farewelled at a special event at Rose Bay Marina on Friday morning.

Anthony Minichello and wife Terry Biviano were among those who soaked up the sunny and hot weather with their daughter Azura.

Olympic swimmer Geoff Huegill and television host Larry Emdur were also in attendance. 

Other 'supersailors' alongside Sally Fitzgibbons include boxer Danny Green, Olympic sailor Tom Slingsby, rugby union player Phil Waugh, chef Guillaume Brahimi.   

Crew safety came first as Victorian yacht Tina of Melbourne became the first yacht to pull out of the Sydney to Hobart race. 

The 37-footer which was just off Bondi when the crew discovered a problem with her hull leaking after sustaining damage in rough conditions outside Sydney Heads. 

'We fell off probably a metre and a half, two-metre wave,' skipper Andy Doolan said.    

Hi-tech American supermaxi Comanche reached the first turning mark in just four minutes and 35 seconds, which is believed to be a record

A 15-knot southerly breeze was forecast for the start of the race and it's tipped to reach 20-28knots by Friday afternoon

'We noticed a bit of water ingress, so at that point I notified the crew.'

'They were all okay, there was no imminent danger. I switched the pumps on and noticed that we couldn't fix the problem there and then so I made the decision to retire.'

'Our number one priority was the safety of the crew. There was no point continuing on.'

Three other boats - Bear Necessity (rudder), Occasional Coarse Language (steering) and Willyama (main sail) - also withdrew in the first four hours.  

Another early casualty was a crew member aboard Last Tango, who was being dropped off at Botany Bay after suffering a hernia issue.

At the front, Comanche was reined in by three of her supermaxi rivals after making a scintillating start that made her the talk of the race.

The high-tech, red and black hulled boat owned by Netscape co-founder Jim Clark and his Australian wife Kristy Hinze-Clark rounded the first mark in an unofficial record time of four minutes and 35 seconds, 35 seconds ahead of seven-times line honours winner Wild Oats X1.  

Wild Oats skipper Mark Richards could only marvelled at the early pace of his boat's newest challenger as she raced clear up Sydney Harbour.

'She's smoking. Look at that thing go!' exclaimed Richards.

Another awed by Comanche's blazing start was 91-year-old Geoff Ruggles, the oldest survivor of the first Sydney to Hobart race in 1945.

'I have a sense of wonderment about the technological advances and the development of this boat Comanche,' Ruggles said.  

However, Comanche skipper Ken Read deflected credit for the hot start and wasn't reading too much into it so early in the 620-nautical mile race.

'The crew pulled the trigger just right,' said Read. 'But you don't get any awards for the start.'

The American veteran said his boat was coping well with the tougher conditions encountered later in the day.

'It's a little bumpy, but the boat is handling the weather quite well,' Read said. 'We're at (winds of) 23 to 26 knots and we're pushing hard, looking good.'

While the boats on all three start lines appeared to get away cleanly, former line honours winner Brindabella made a 720-degree turn, though organisers were unsure why.

The fleet were expected to encounter some more strong southerly breezes on Friday night before a forecast lightening of conditions some time on Saturday morning.  

This year, yachts lined up on three start lines because of the large number of boats taking part. 

Sydney to Hobart newcomer Comanche made the most impressive start by a race rookie in memory, blitzing the fleet to be first out of the Sydney Heads.

The hi-tech American supermaxi reached the first turning mark in just four minutes and 35 seconds, which is believed to be a record.

She beat seven-times line honours winner Wild Oats X1 by 35 seconds with Syd Fischer's Ragamuffin 100 third and Anthony Bell's Perpetual LOYAL fourth. 

Supermaxi Wild Oats XI is favourite to take line honours again this year, but will face stiff competition from 100-footers Perpetual Loyal, Ragamuffin and American yacht Comanche.

The Sydney to Hobart is one of three major races in the world and has become an iconic part of the Australian summer.

The race is expected to end on New Year's Eve in Hobart.  

Channel Seven Mornings host Larry Emdur was also in attendance at Rose Bay
