They’ve both come from obscurity to make their names as the biggest breakthrough acts in the NFL and NBA seasons - but that’s not the only characteristic shared by Tim Tebow and Jeremy Lin.

Now the duo, who have shot to fame for their strong Christian faith as well as their amazing sporting ability, have become friends after speaking of their admiration for each other over the phone.

New York Knicks NBA point guard Lin, 23, said he is ‘very inspired’ by Denver Broncos quarterback Tebow, 24, who replied that Lin is a ‘great role model’, according to Lin’s former Harvard chaplain.

‘They've spoken over the telephone,’ Adrian Tam told People. ‘Jeremy's been a fan of Tebow's for a while. His comment to me was that Tim is a really great guy and that he's very inspired by him.’

Lin met with Sportin Scarves CEO Kenny Blakeney last November and told him how he loved what Tebow was standing for, when many were imitating his prayer pose by ‘Tebowing’, reported People.

Both Lin and Tebow hope to become pastors after finishing their careers and have been very open about their faith. Lin’s Twitter feed has the description: ‘To know Him is to want to know Him more’.

Late last month he asked a chaplain at Florida’s American Airlines Arena before the New York Knicks took on the Miami Heat to pray that his arm would not get cut again, reported the New York Post.

Tebow told ESPN earlier this week that he has ‘had the pleasure of getting to know him over the last few weeks and what a great guy he is’, adding: ‘I think he's a great role model - and I'm proud of it.’

It comes as a trademark war brews over the catch-phrase ‘Linsanity’, which describes the crazed excitement around the former Golden State Warriors player from Palo Alto, California.

Since his breakout 25-point game against the New Jersey Nets earlier this month, there have been seven patent applications filed, including one by Pamela Deese, who is a lawyer representing Lin.

The applications cover use of the phrase on everything from mobile phone cases and sunglasses to action figures and footwear, but a trademark can take a year or more to register.

The NBA said Lin jerseys have been the hottest selling shirts at its online store since his performance against the Nets and it will be selling more Lin-related good such as plush animals and bobbleheads.

Lin famously used to sleep on the sofa of his New York University student brother Joshua in Manhattan’s Lower East Side - but he’s moved up in the world now to get a flat of his own.

His two-bedroom rental, listed at $13,000 a month, is on the 38th floor of the residences at the W New York Downtown Hotel in Manhattan and impressively overlooks the Statue of Liberty.

The NBA star, whose parents are from Taiwan, is a 6’3’ 200lbs economics graduate and the fervour around his recent amazing performances has rescued a Knicks season that was looking dire.
