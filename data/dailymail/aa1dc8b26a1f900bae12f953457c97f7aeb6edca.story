A mild-mannered man who was transformed into a gun-toting bank robber straight out of The Sweeney by the effects of an undiagnosed brain tumour has had his indefinite jail sentence overturned.

Trevor Hayes, 47, was sentenced to imprisonment for public protection in July 2011 after pulling off a string of terrifying robberies, during which he put a sawn-off shotgun to the heads of customers in a Post Office and bank, bagging nearly £50,000.

Hayes, of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, a man whose previous record consisted largely of ‘petty theft’ and to whom violent action was ‘out of character’, also used the illegal gun to threaten two motorists in a layby off the A404, making off with a van which he later used as a getaway vehicle.

Hayes – who pleaded guilty to three 
counts of robbery, various firearm offences and arson at Oxford Crown 
Court – was jailed indefinitely after Judge Gordon Risius decided he was
a dangerous offender who posed a serious risk to the public.

But Lord Justice Davis, Mr Justice 
King and Mr Justice Kenneth Parker, sitting at London’s Criminal Appeal 
Court, have overturned that finding after hearing that, six months after
he was jailed, a large brain tumour was found to be the cause of his 
‘aggressive and compulsive behaviour’.

The court heard that, under the 
influence of the tumour which was pressing on his frontal lobe, Hayes 
carried out two brutal armed raids in Oxfordshire.

Appeal: Hayes, 47, from Henley on Thames, Oxfordshire, captured on CCTV images during one of his raids, had his indefinite jail term overturned after top judges found that an undiagnosed brain tumour had turned him from a mild mannered man into a dangerous criminal

He also lurked in a layby, 
threatening drivers who were taking a comfort break on two separate 
occasions, taking a van belonging to one of them. Barrister Jonathan 
Rose told the court yesterday that it was not until Hayes was behind 
bars that his condition was discovered and the tumour removed.

Mr Rose presented a medical report to
the court, in which a doctor explained the “unusual scenario” and said 
that, having undergone surgery, Hayes is no longer violent or a risk to 
the public.

Saying Hayes’s violent actions had 
been ‘out of character’, the barrister concluded: ‘The concern is no 
longer there. It is such an unusual scenario.’

Lord Justice Davis said: ‘There is a 
direct link between the size of the tumour and his behaviour. The 
evidence appears to be clear.’

Quashing the indefinite sentence, Mr 
Justice King replaced it with an 11-year jail term, of which Hayes will 
serve half before qualifying for automatic release.

The judge said that he had not 
reduced the sentence any further because the medical report had not 
concluded that Hayes had not realised he was committing crimes.

He said: ‘He knew what he was doing was wrong.’

Out of charachter: The judges decided the massive tumour had been pushing on Hayes' frontal lobe, changing his behaviour

Discovery: The Court of Appeal, pictured, was told that it was not until Hayes was behind bars that his condition was discovered and the tumour removed by surgeons
