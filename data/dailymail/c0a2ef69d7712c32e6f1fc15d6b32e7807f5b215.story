Luis Suarez has added to his growing list of awards by being been named Barclays Player of the Season for 2013/14.

The Liverpool striker scored 31 goals and made 12 assists in 33 Premier League appearances this term as Liverpool narrowly lost out to Manchester City in a thrilling race for the title.

Suarez, who has also scooped the PFA Players' Player of the Year and the Football Writers' Player of the Year gongs this season, collected his fourth award of the season by winning the Barclays Golden Boot award too.

The Uruguay striker, who is set to face England at the World Cup on June 19, finished the campaign as the top goalscorer in the top flight - 10 clear of Reds team-mate Daniel Sturridge.

The award completed a prestigious few hours for Liverpool after manager Brendan Rodgers was named the League Managers' Association Manager of the Year on Monday night.

The Northern Irishman was honoured for the first time at the annual awards dinner in London after he led the Reds to second place in the Barclays Premier League, which was the club's highest finish in five years.

The award is voted for by all LMA members, including every manager from the top four professional leagues in English football.

Despite their dominantion of the individual awards, Liverpool's season will remain tinged with sadness after losing out to City in the title race.

Defender Kolo Toure believes the pain of missing out on a first league title for 24 years will make the Reds players stronger and give them a better chance of ending their drought next season.  

Toure, who has had to watch from the sidelines for most of the second half of the campaign after making a promising start to his Liverpool career, believes the experience gained this season will be of benefit in the long run.

'I think we did everything we could and at the end City won it,' he said. 'The most important thing was that we have been fighting until the end.

'We will learn from the mistakes we made and next year we will be better.

'Nobody expected us to be where we are but we lacked a little bit of experience and that is why I think we will gain experience.

'We will gain experience by making those mistakes and losing the title like we did.

'I am sure that will give us the strength to better next year.'

So close: Liverpool's title chase came up just short, leaving Suarez in tears at Crystal Palace last week

Suarez, meanwhile, was named by by boss Oscar Washington Tabarez in Uruguay's 25-man preliminary World Cup squad on Tuesday alongside Liverpool team-mate Sebastian Coates.

Defender Coates was sidelined for almost eight months after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury on international duty last August, but has been on the comeback trail at former club Nacional, whom he joined on loan from the Reds in January

There are three other Premier League players in the squad with Liverpool star Luis Suarez, West Brom defender Diego Lugano and Southampton midfielder Gaston Ramirez included, along with 34-year-old Cerezo Osaka forward Diego Forlan and Paris St Germain's Edinson Cavani in a powerful-looking attack.
