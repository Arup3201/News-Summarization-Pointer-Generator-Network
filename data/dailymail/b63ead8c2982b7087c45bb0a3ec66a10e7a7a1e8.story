The discovery of an underground bunker  in a 41-year-old cold case where two young girls went missing from Adelaide Oval, may provide a breakthrough for investigators.

Joanne Ratcliffe, 11, and Kirste Gordon, 4, disappeared from the sporting field during a match between Norwood and North Adelaide on August 25, 1973.

Police have chased more than 2000 leads of inquiry since the girls disappeared 41 years ago, and the case shocked the country and became one of the nation's most infamous murder mysteries.

Fresh leads have now been uncovered that place the case's key suspect - Stanley Arthur Hart - at the ground when the two young girls went missing, according to the Adelaide Advertiser.

In addition to this detectives have found an underground bunker at Hart's childhood home, which was deserted for a year from March 1973.

Hart, who was a known paedophile, died in 1999. Former properties of the man have previously been extensively searched as part of the investigation into the abduction of the two children.

Stanley Arthur Hart was named by his grandson, convicted paedophile Mark Trevor Marshall, in a 2007 confession provided to the Mullighan Inquiry into abuse of children in state care. 

Now Hart's childhood home in Prospect, about 8 kilometres from the Adelaide CBD, has now come under scrutiny after officers excavated two wells at another of his former homes in Yatina last year.

An old underground bunker found at Hart's Prospect home, which had two entrances and could fit at least four adults, is believed to have been filled in some time before 1975, but after the disappearance of the girls.

It has also been revealed by The Adelaide Advertiser that from March 1973, no one besides Hart had any access to the home.

The current owners of the home said although there has never been any police interest in the property in the 40 years they have lived there, they would cooperate should the bunker need to be excavated.

Major Crime police are currently investigating the link, and the case has been revisited as part of SA Police's State's Most Wanted Cold Case Unit move to solve all 110 unsolved murders.

'Major Crime detectives are assessing information recently received in relation to a Prospect address,' police confirmed.

Joannae's sister Suzanne has urged police to take recently leads into the case seriously.

Suzie, who was born a year after her sister Joanne disappeared, made an impassioned plea for information via a social media campaign in 2012.

'While people are talking about the case, there is always hope,' Ms Ratcliffe said.

'It's time Joanne came home. We are over wanting to know who did it, how they did it and why they did it.'

'We want to be able to lay (Joanne) to rest and lay my dad's soul to rest also.' 

Hart's family have said while he was not with them at Adelaide Oval on the day in question, he would have 'almost certainly' been somewhere at the field.

Joanne and Kirste were last seen around 5pm on the day they were abducted, in North Adelaide with their abductor.

Last year Hart was still the key suspect in the chilling case, and officers knocked down walls and dug up the backyard of his property in Yatina.
