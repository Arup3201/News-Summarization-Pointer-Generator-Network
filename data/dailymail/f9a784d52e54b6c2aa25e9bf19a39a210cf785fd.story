A rat-infested Russian cruise ship cast adrift in the Atlantic Ocean is being tracked by U.S. intelligence officials.

The MV Lyubov Orlova - named after a Soviet actress - was being towed to the Dominican Republic from Newfoundland, Canada, to be 
scrapped in January when the cable snapped.

The Orlova slipped 
away as the crew on board the towing ship battled howling winds and 10ft
waves to try in vain to reconnect the line - and it drifted away.

A supply vessel called the Atlantic Hawk was able to reconnect to the Orlova a short time later, only to have the cable fail again.

The ghostly liner was not seen again until about a month later, when a was spotted 1,300 nautical miles from Ireland's west coast.

The ship's last reported location is about 1,125 miles from Ireland and 760 miles from Newfoundland.

Christine Phillips, a spokeswoman for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, told FoxNews.com: 'We continue to receive information about the ship's location, and will issue message when needed to facilitate safe navigation.'

The luxury liner, however, is likely to stay at sea for the foreseeable future, as no one seems willing to claim the 37-year-old boat.

Canada's transport authority has said
the abandoned ship is no longer its concern as the vessel has left the 
country's waters, with officials insisting the owner of the Orlova is 
responsible for its movements.

Court records obtained by the Globe and Mail newspaper show that the vessel is owned by Hussein Humayuni, the owner of Neptune International Shipping Inc.

He has not returned messages by the newspaper for comment.

A document from the National 
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency analyzes satellite imagery and uses the results to create detailed maps for the U.S. government.

The empty liner is understood to be slowly drifting towards the European coastline, but its has no warning lights and a 
broken global positioning system.

Now home only to rats, the 1976-built ship once carried passengers on Antarctic cruises.

The
ship was seized by authorities in Newfoundland in 2010 amid spiralling 
debts owed to charter firm Cruise North Expeditions after faults on 
board meant a scheduled cruise had to be cancelled.

She is understood to have been sold to Neptune International Shipping in February last year to be broken up.
