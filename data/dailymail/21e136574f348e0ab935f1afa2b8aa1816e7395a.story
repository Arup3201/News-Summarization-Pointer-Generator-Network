Scruffy new teachers will be forced to dress smarter and get a tighter grip on pupil misbehaviour under an Ofsted shake-up.

They will be expected to project a more professional image in the classroom to set a better example to their students.

Ofsted insists that from ‘day one’, trainees and freshly qualified teachers should act and dress in a way that befits their position.

Crackdown: Scruffy new teachers will be forced to dress smarter under an Ofsted shake-up. They will be expected to project a more professional image in the classroom to set a better example to their students

The move is part of a crackdown on teacher training providers, which the watchdog believes are not adequately preparing new recruits for the rigours of the classroom.

Ofsted yesterday launched a consultation on a revised framework for inspecting initial teacher education (ITE), which will be implemented in June.

This places a greater emphasis on trainees’ handling of pupil misbehaviour and the standard of their ‘professional dress and conduct’.

Inspectors will judge the quality of their training in how to instil discipline and cope with bad behaviour.

Concern: Ofsted's chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, warns that trainee teachers are being sent into classrooms inadequately prepared

Specific attention will be paid to how well trainees ‘manage behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe learning environment’.

Inspection frameworks will be changed to ensure that inspectors can ‘directly observe how well trainees teach nearer the end of their training’.

They will also return to assess newly qualified teachers (NQTs) in the first term of their employment as part of a two-stage inspection process.

At present Ofsted does a single visit - observing the teaching of trainees and former trainees based in the same schools or colleges.

Referring to the shake-up, the consultation document says: ‘We believe that this will allow a sharper focus on trainees’ outcomes and how well they are prepared for teaching and the rigours of the classroom.’ 

In a speech to the North of England education conference in January, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, warned that trainee teachers are being sent into classrooms inadequately prepared.

He said: ‘How many times have I heard that trainees are being sent into schools without proper guidance on professional behaviour or dress?’ 

‘How many times have I heard that trainees have been inadequately prepared to deal with poor behaviour?’ 

Sir Michael said that if trainee teachers are struggling in the classroom, the college where they trained should share some of the responsibility.

He added: ‘Ofsted has not been as demanding as it should have been with training providers who have sent newly qualified teachers out into schools unprepared for the rigours of the classroom.

‘In my view, there is no such thing as a bad NQT (newly qualified teacher), just one that is badly trained, poorly accredited and badly supported.’ 

Sean Harford, Ofsted national director of Initial Teacher Training, said yesterday: ‘Parents know that it is really important that trainee teachers get the best quality training before they face a classroom of pupils or students.

Discipline: New teaching recruits will also be forced to get a tighter grip on pupil misbehaviour. The move is part of a crackdown on teacher training providers, which Ofsted believes are not adequately preparing new recruits

‘That’s why from June, Ofsted will raise standards for teacher training partnerships to make sure that all new teachers are as ready as they can possibly be to excel in the classroom.’ 

An Ofsted spokesman added: ‘We are not being prescriptive about what teachers should and should not wear.

‘But we are clear that teachers must, on day one, conduct themselves and be dressed in a manner which befits their professional status.’ 

Ofsted inspects all training which leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) for maintained schools and further education teacher training that has been endorsed by higher education institutions.

Its public consultation runs until May.
