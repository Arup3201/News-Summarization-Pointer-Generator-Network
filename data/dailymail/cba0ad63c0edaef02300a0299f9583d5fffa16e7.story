The Russian President is fighting back against recently-revealed claims that he stole a Super Bowl ring from New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.

On Sunday, Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the $25,000 Super Bowl XXXIX ring was clearly offered by Kraft as a gift.

It is currently housed in the Kremlin's museum, along with all over state gifts, he added.

Kraft turned the 2005 incident into international news on Thursday when he publicly claimed that Putin pocketed his ring after asking to examine it. Kraft said he was asked by American government officials to later say it was a gift to save international embarrassment.

Peskov told CNN that he doesn't know why Kraft, a billionaire business magnate, is making the allegations against Putin.

'What Mr. Kraft is saying now is 
weird. I was standing 20 centimeters away from him and Mr. Putin and saw
and heard how Mr. Kraft gave this ring as a gift,' he told the network.

That's not the way Kraft told the story Thursday night in front of a packed crowd at Carnegie Hall’s Medal of Excellence gala in New York, the New York Post reports.

‘I took out the ring and showed it to
[Putin], and he put it on and he goes, “I can kill someone with this 
ring,”’  Kraft told the crowd.

‘I put my hand out and he put it in his pocket, and three KGB guys got around him and walked out.’

Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said Kraft's version of events. He also said Putin never kept the ring for himself.

Instead, he sent it to the Kremlin museum, where other Russian state gifts are kept, he said.

The incident occurred in 2005, the summer after the Patriots had won their third Super Bowl under his Kraft's ownership.

He was one of a number of prominent American businessmen who visited Russia to meet with Putin. 

At the time, Kraft released a public statement saying the 
diamond-encrusted ring - worth more than  $25,000 - had been a gift.

'President Putin, a great and knowledgeable sports fan, was clearly taken
with its uniqueness. I decided to give him the ring as a symbol of the 
respect and admiration that I have for the Russian people and [his] 
leadership,' read Kraft's statement at the time.

But now 
Kraft has claimed that Putin simply pocketed the 4.94-carat ring and that the White House intervened when he 
demanded it back, reports the

According to Kraft he received a call from the George W. Bush-run White House, saying, 'It would really be in the best interest of US-Soviet relations if you meant to give the ring as a present.'

But, Kraft said, 'I really didn’t [want to]. I had an emotional tie to the ring, it has my name on it. I don’t want to see it on eBay. There was a pause on the other end of the line, and the voice repeated, "It would really be in the best interest if you meant to give the ring as a present.’”

The ring is reportedly kept in the Kremlin library.
