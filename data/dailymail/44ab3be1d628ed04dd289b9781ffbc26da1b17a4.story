A couple with a 57-year age gap have insisted that they married for love but admit that they both have concerns about their relationship. 

Richard Lugner, 82, wed German TV presenter and former Playboy model Cathy Schmitz, 25, last September after a brief courtship that lasted just seven months.

It is the fifth marriage for the Austrian billionaire and he admits the path to marital bliss has already been rocky. 

He told This Morning: 'We have to learn to be married.'

Richard Lugner, 82, married Cathy Schmitz, 25, last September. The Austrian billionaire has been married four times before. German TV star Cathy says her husband's wealth isn't important

Patterned sequin mini dress

She may be married to a man almost 60 years her senior, but that didn't stop Playboy model Cathy Schmitz from wearing a freakum dress for a TV appearance with her billionaire husband. The 25-year-old donned a sequined purple and black minidress that left her perfect pins on display and she accessorized with drop earrings.

We love a good party dress and what's better that a sparkly mini for a night of dancing and having a good time? If you want to show off your physique like Khloe Kardashian or Taylor Swift, who both gravitate towards this look on special occasions, throw one on with sky high stilettos and a clutch purse and you're good to go!

We've come up with several selections for your next soiree in our style edit from Nasty Gal and Guess that will be sure to get you noticed. Prepare to turn heads in these shiny getups.

The successful businessman had previously sworn off marriage forever after his fourth divorce, but admits that Cathy managed to change his mind after they started dating last February. 

The couple were engaged in August and married a month later. 

He said: 'I had been married four times, and when I met Cathy I had been divorced for seven years. I didn't want to get married ever again.'

Despite his misgivings, Cathy managed to change his mind, but Richard admits that he is still very fearful that his new wife is more interested in his bank balance than his personality. 

 He said: 'I am always worried. 

'Ladies are very dangerous  - to be married is dangerous. '(But) I like to fight with the young ladies. It's better for me.'

Cathy, who was trying to make her name as TV presenter in Germany before she crossed paths with the billionaire, admits that she loves the luxury lifestyle that comes with being Richard's wife, but that it isn't the reason she married him. 

She said: 'When we met I thought he was a nice guy. I knew he was rich, I am from Germany - he is very famous person.' 

'Of course it's nice to life a luxury life. But it's not very important to me. 

'Before I met him I was pushing my own career on the television. But I had to make a decision between love and my career.' 

'(And) I am not the first woman that is much younger than him - none of his wives were as old as him.' 

Cathy's engagement and wedding rings 

While many would struggle to understand what an octogenarian and a woman in her twenties could have in common, Cathy maintains that it is a match made in heaven. 

She said: 'I have a good teacher as he has been married four times before.

'I dated a lot of young boys – they are only looking out for themselves. They like football and many women.

'I have a lot of fun with him (but also)I have a six-year-old daughter to look after – I need a man.'

This isn't the first time that Richard has made headlines outside of Austria. 

The businessman is well known for paying famous celebrities, including Raquel Welch, Farrah Fawcett, Carmen Electra, Pamela Anderson and Paris Hilton, to accompany him to the prestigious Opera Ball in Vienna, Austria, every year.

Last year, he reportedly paid Kim Kardashian $500,000 (£328,897) to be his date to the event.

But Richard was less than impressed with Kim's behaviour and labelled her annoying.

He told the press: 'Kim is annoying me. Because she’s not sticking to the program.

'She’s filming and so she doesn’t want to have me around. The guest should be with me and not anywhere else that is not agreed upon.'

The 33-year-old beauty also turned down his offer to dance. 

Richard and Cathy star on Age Gap Love on Channel 5 at 10pm tomorrow night.
