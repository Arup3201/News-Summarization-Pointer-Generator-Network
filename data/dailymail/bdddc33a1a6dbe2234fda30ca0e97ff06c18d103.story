A $300,000 McLaren sports car was wrecked after a man's tractor trailer stalled and was plowed into by a train as it sat on the tracks.

The driver of the truck heard a train coming and made out before his vehicle was hit. No one was injured in the Orange Park, Florida, crash on Friday. 

A McLaren MP4-12C, however, was heavily damaged.

Ryan Fung was taking Jorg Bober's McLaren to a dealership near Orange Park, Florida, for warranty work when we got stuck on the railroad tracks

Though Fung escaped his truck when he heard the train coming, he couldn't save the car which was in a trailer in tow

Bober received a call from Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater, a McLaren dealership, who said his car had been totaled

Truck driver Ryan Fung frantically called 911 when we got stuck at the crossing. 

'Yeah I'm stuck right across. The bars are coming down, and he's about to hit the truck,' he told the dispatcher. 

The dispatcher told Fung to get out of the truck as a train horn sounded in the background. 

Fung escaped the crash with about three minutes to spare but he was unable to save the car in tow, according to First Coast News. 

The car's owner, Dr Jorg Bober told Palm Beach Post that his car had been picked up by the company for warranty work when it got stuck on the tracks. 

'My nurse called me up, she says "Listen, take doctors Lake Drive the opposite way to college because there's a huge train accident". I didn't think anything of it. Five minutes later I get a call from the company saying, "Your car is totaled". I was like "Really? That's my car?" the pediatrician said.

Bober only found out about the accident from a nurse who told him to take an alternative route to work to miss the traffic

Bober's hoping that Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater will cover losses since it was being taken to their dealership

When asked about the accident Bober was in good spirts, saying he'd 'get another one' once the accident was sorted out

But Bober's resolution to the issue of having a totaled exotic car was simple. 

'Eh, we'll get another one,' he told Palm Beach Post. 

Bober hopes Dimmitt Automotive Group in Clearwater, the McLaren dealership where he bought the car, will cover the loss, according to WFLA.

'They've apologized, ya know. And as far as I'm concerned, that's what they can do right now. I mean, I'm actually pretty happy that no one got hurt,' he told WFLA.

The area where the accident occurred has signs that read 'No Thru Trucks', meaning the truck driver should not have driven across the tracks. Florida Highway Patrol said the driver will be cited.

Clay County Sheriff's Office, Florida Highway Patrol and Florida Department of Transportation were at the scene on Friday. 

Four trains transporting vehicles from Orlando to Louisville and two passenger Amtrak trains were affected or delayed from the crash. 

The area where the driver crossed the tracks has a large sign reading, 'No Thru Trucks'. Fung will be cited for driving through the area, Florida Highway Patrol said
