Three men died within eight months of each other after taking the drug GHB at the same gay sauna, an inquest has heard.

Greg Page, 41, head of communications at pharmaceutical giant Roche, was found dead at the Pleasuredrome sauna, in Waterloo, south London, at 8am on a Saturday morning in October 2012, the hearing was told.

John Scott, 46, a security officer at City bank Goldman Sachs, was also found collapsed at the same time as Mr Page and rushed to hospital by paramedics. He died two days later, Southwark Coroner's Court was told.

Three men died within eight months of each other after taking the drug GHB at the Pleasuredrome gay sauna within eight months, an inquest heard

Both men had the drugs GHB in their system, the inquest was told, but whereas Mr Page had mixed the drug with alcohol and cocaine, Mr Scott had taken the legal high, MPA, a meth-amphetamine substitute.

The incident came just two 
hours after a third man was removed unconscious from the premises by 
paramedics after taking the drug. He was taken to intensive care but 
recovered and was released from hospital days later, the inquest heard.

The court heard that eight months earlier another man, 41-year-old Konstantinos Bampatzis, was found dead in a locked private room after taking mephedrone and GHB at the same 24-hour sauna

Sauna manager Ivan Stepenov told the inquest that he found Mr Bampatzis.

He was alerted by a friend of Mr Bampatzis that he was unwell and said the man had locked himself inside the private sauna, the inquest heard.

Mr Stepenov said he rushed to the room and opened it with a master key where he tried to revive Mr Bampatzis by giving him First Aid and CPR.

Police later found a bottle of GHB, a bag of white powder and an unused condom lying nearby. His cause of death was found to be a result of a lethal cocktail of the two drugs.

Mr Bampatzis, a supervisor from Parliament Hill, north London, had no family in the UK and had moved to London from Greece.

Southwark Coroner's Court was told that Greg Page, 41, and John Scott, 46, both died after taking the drug at the sauna

Southwark Coroner Dr Andrew Harris questioned the sauna's proprietor, Charles Hill, over the establishment's drug policy and alleged lack of emergency lighting, making it difficult for paramedics to see to the unconscious customer.

Mr Hill insisted that drug searches had become 'more aggressive' since the death of Mr Bampatzis and said Pleasuredrome now had a reputation for being clean.

He said the sauna complex was now fitted out with emergency strip lights which staff could switch on at any time.

Dr Harris recorded a narrative verdict into Mr Bampatzis' death.

He said: 'His death was drug related from a combination of mephedrone and GHB.

'There is no evidence the drugs were forcibly given to him and there is no evidence he tried to take his life.'

The coroner went on to say it was 'possible' the sauna's zero tolerance to drugs was not being implemented 'aggressively' enough at the time, but was assured changes had been made.

Today, the joint inquest into the deaths of Mr Page and Mr Scott heard how an ambulance was called to Pleasuredrome eight months after Mr Bampatzis' death where the PR boss was found already dead.

Both men were found to have died as a
 result of the GHB in their system, which caused significant brain 
injury and eventual pneumonia in the case of Mr Scott.

Forensic toxicologist Fiona Perry told the court Mr Page had 803 milligrams of GHB per litre of blood, and 0.13 milligrams of cocaine per litre of blood.

She said in a statement: 'Gregory Page had alcohol in his blood, mild levels, and GHB levels enough for a fatality. Cocaine was also relatively high...'

Drug GHB (Gamma Hydroxy Butyrate), nicknamed Grevious Bodily Harm, or Blue, or Heaven. The men were all found to have traces of it in their systems when they died

Senior paramedic and advisor to the London Ambulance Service medical director, David Whitemore, told the court of his concerns about safety at Pleasuredrome.

He said he had become concerned about the establishment after a number of staff members told him about the three patients on October 27th.

'They said they were always going there, very very frequently,' he said.

'When I looked at the call outs, it was clear we were being called for substance problems.'

The paramedic said he spoke to ambulance staff who attended Pleasuredrome and was told the lighting was dim and the rooms cramped, which made it difficult to treat patients.

Owner, Charles Hill, told the 
inquest the sauna is for gay and bi-sexual males.

Mr Hill said 
there was 'at least one, if not two' members of staff on duty with first
 aid training, and at the time of Mr Page's death, there were three.

He
 added the complex now had 'lots of phones' where staff could make 
emergency calls and improvements had been made to the 'recovery room'.

In
 negotiations with Lambeth Council, Mr Hill agreed to lower the number 
of hours available for rent of private rooms from three to two, and that emergency lighting had been added.

Mr Page, from Rotherhithe, was an avid Arsenal fan and celebrated in the pharmaceutical industry for helping to promote the breast cancer drug Herceptin.

His boyfriend of nine months before he died, Graham McGowan, also attended the inquest, accompanied by a friend.

Sandra Drapper, Mr Page's mother, said her son was healthy and in good spirits before he died.

'He was very dedicated, popular and family orientated. He loved playing with his nephew, travelling, cooking and gardening.

'I spoke to him the day before he died and he was happy, he'd sold some shares which went well and he was going to use the money for a deposit on a flat.'

Mr Scott's brother, Christopher, and his cousin, Justin Wood, said their relative had a 'very full life' and was an artist in his free time, selling sculptures for charity.

'He got a first in fine art at university - he was very creative,' said Mr Wood. 'He was very popular and greatly missed.'

Pleasuredrome, the London Ambulance Service and Lambeth Council are all represented at the joint inquest into the deaths of Mr Page and Mr Scott and will be putting forward their evidence of how and why the two men died.

The hearing continues.
