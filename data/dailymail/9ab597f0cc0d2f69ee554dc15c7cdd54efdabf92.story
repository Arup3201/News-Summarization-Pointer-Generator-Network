Fraud: Danielle Watson (pictured yesterday) said she had late-stage cervical cancer to claim donations, freebies and cut-price deals for her wedding

A young mother defrauded friends and kindhearted strangers out of thousands of pounds by claiming she had terminal cancer -and even deceived her own husband into thinking she was dying.

Danielle Watson, 24, said she had late-stage cervical cancer from January 2012 to claim donations, freebies and cut-price deals for her upcoming wedding worth almost £10,000.

The then 21-year-old administration assistant of Rowhedge, Essex, even brought forward her wedding by several months to April that year so she could walk up the aisle with new husband Chris before radiotherapy and chemotherapy made her hair fall out.

But in fact she had minor surgery for a treatable gynaecological condition and had never been diagnosed with, or treated for, cancer.

She aroused suspicions by failing to provide proof of her illness and demanding all donations be paid to her account. She then revealed in June 2012 that she was pregnant.

She had denied six counts of fraud but - appearing pregnant again - dramatically changed her pleas on the first day of her trial at Basildon Crown Court, sitting in Southend, and now faces the prospect of a jail sentence.

Rebecca Blain, for Watson, told the court that with an 18-month-old child and her second due in mid-November, her client had been worried about getting an immediate prison sentence.

Mrs Blain said: ‘One of those she told was her then to-be husband. Her own family all fell under the umbrella of that lie. 

'She has told friends and family and she will have to learn to live and come to terms with the fact that she has told them what are the most despicable lies.’

Recorder Gerard Pounder said Watson had ‘preyed on human kindness’ and he could not guarantee she would avoid a custodial sentence.

Wedding planner Leigh Stewart gave Watson free help worth £1,100 through her Fantasy Dream Events business and then helped raise thousands more in donations.

Speaking outside court the 52-year-old mother of six said she had since closed down her business, partly because of what happened. And she still wants to know why Watson did it.

Mrs Stewart said: ‘It’s appalling, she affected my family, my life, my work. Not just me, lots of people. I think she needs help. It is not a logical mind that does that.’

Mrs Stewart, from Billericay, said she became suspicious after people pointed out that Watson did not look ill, saying the fraudster ‘became defensive’ and told her ‘I don’t have to prove anything to anyone’.

When an anonymous benefactor made contact after an article in the Basildon Echo and offered to pay for Watson’s first round of vitamin C treatment she was ‘a bit funny about it’, Mrs Stewart added.

The money Mrs Stewart raised for Watson has been given to the Mercedes Curnow Foundation in Cornwall, which helps people with cervical cancer, she said.

Essex Police investigating officer Detective Constable Rob Lewis said: ‘Danielle Watson acted in a cold and calculated manner.

‘She befriended and abused the trust of kind and generous people who wanted to help a person they thought was dying.

‘She obtained significant financial gain, gifts and services from the kind hearted and at no point throughout the investigation did she demonstrate any form of remorse or shoulder the responsibility for her conduct.

‘Watson’s actions attracted national media coverage and sadly the greatest impact a case of this nature will have is that it could undermine future public fundraising efforts for genuine causes.

‘Everyone involved will be that bit more cautious and cynical the next time they are asked to make a donation.’

He added that the Mercedes Curnow Foundation received £6,563.

The court had earlier heard that friends and complete strangers gave Watson money and held fundraising events to provide cash for additional ‘vitamin C treatment’ after being told she had a 15 to 20 per cent chance of survival.

Others gave free or cut-price deals including a wedding dress worth £699 after hearing of her plight.

She also got free haircuts and a reduced deal - including free champagne - on her wedding reception at the Ivory Rooms venue in Billericay.

Prosecutor Marcus Croskell said Watson was ‘involved in many aspects of fundraising from their conception’.

He added: ‘At no stage was she told by a medical professional that she had any form of cancer, let alone stage four cervical cancer, and she has never had treatment for it. 

'Any such assertions are dishonest and false.’

Others events including a £1,640 Twitter auction, raffles, cake sales and fundraising nights at which she appeared raised almost £10,000 towards the vitamin C treatment, which costs £6,000 per cycle, the jury of seven women and five men heard.

Some of those involved were people she knew but others came forward after hearing about her plight.

In one interview with the Basildon Echo the then admin assistant for the Financial Services Authority in London said she had ‘terminal’ cancer and added that she was ‘hoping for a miracle’, the jury was told.

In an interview for Full House magazine, carried out by a press agency, she said she had stage four cervical cancer with a ‘low chance’ of survival, Mr Croskell added.

In fact she had undergone keyhole surgery after an obstetrician said she may be suffering from ovarian polyps.

The court heard that she told one friend that the bandage from the keyhole surgery was from a positive cancer biopsy.

Those who helped included Ms Stewart and Barclays worker Victoria Oliver, who held fundraising events at the bank after Watson came in to open an account for funds.

Mr Croskell added: ‘She (Watson) encouraged parties to offer their goods, services money and time for free or reduced rates because of her purported illness.’

Watson was released on bail, to be sentenced on January 9.
