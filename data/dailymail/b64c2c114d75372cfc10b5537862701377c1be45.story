An overwhelming number of heartfelt tributes are flowing in for the private school boy who died after he plummeted from a 30metre crane to his death.

It is not yet known whether Carl Salomon, 19, fell or jumped into the water from the industrial vehicle on a construction barge in Balmain East, in Sydney's inner west, on Thursday morning.

Police believe the former Newington College student had been drinking and 'skylarking' with a friend before he disappeared into the water at about 5am - and his body was found four hours later.

One of many tributes has come from Carl's old principal, Dr David Mulford, of the exclusive boys inner west Sydney school where the much-loved teen graduated from in 2013.

Dr Mulford said the entire school community's thoughts and prayers are with Carl's family his parents, Marianne and Alexander, and his sister Helena.

His friends said the keen rower and volley ball player had just secured a job as a 'model/waiter' - an affectionate jibe at Mr Salomon's good looks - who worked at Assembly bar in the city.

'He was a bit of a ladies' man,' his mate said jokingly. 

Assembly Bar owner Jaime Araya said Carl was a valued and popular member of the team where he had worked part-time as a waiter over the past month.  

'Carl was an enthusiastic, kind, fun-loving and spirited young man who had a bright future ahead of him,' he said.'

'The management and staff of Assembly are shocked by today's news and we offer our deepest sympathies to Carl's family and friends.

'We ask that the media respect our privacy during this very difficult time.'

His devastated friends came together at the wharf where Carl met his tragic death on Thursday

Carl was much loved by all who considered him 'a legend and nicest person you would ever meet'

Carl's friends could not speak highly enough of their mate who was also described as someone who 'lived life to the full'

Carl's friends could not speak highly enough of their mate who was also described as someone who 'lived life to the full.' 

Marcus Atallah said Carl was 'obviously one of our best friends and a top bloke.'

'He probably enjoyed himself the most out of anyone I know - that's the way we want people to know him,' he said.

While another friend James Smith remembered his pal as 'a legend and nicest person you would ever meet'.

His friend with him at the time of the tragedy spent 10 minutes swimming around the wharf in a desperate attempt to find Carl but eventually alerted the neighbours.

It is believed Mr Salomon lived around the corner from the wharf. 

Acting Inspector Alex Barrell said it was a tragedy that could have been avoided.

'This is just a case where it appears that sky-larking with some alcohol involved has led to the tragic death of a 19-year-old male.'
