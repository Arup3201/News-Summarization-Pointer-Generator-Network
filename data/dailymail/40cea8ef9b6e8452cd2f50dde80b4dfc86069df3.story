The parents of US aid worker Peter Kassig, who was beheaded by ISIS militants over the weekend, revealed on Twitter on Thursday that they adopted him at birth.

'We proudly acknowledge that we adopted our son, Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig, as a newborn,' Ed and Paula Kassig posted on the Kassig Family Twitter page at around 6pm Eastern time.

'We have always been, and will always be, grateful that his birthmother, Rhonda Schwindt, chose us to be his parents.

Adopted: Parents of slain aid worker Peter/Abdul-Rahman Kassig, seen standing in front of a truck filled with supplies for Syrian refugees, revealed on Twitter on Thursday that he was adopted at birth 

Grateful: Ed and Paula Kassig, pictured  during a press conference on Monday, thanked Peter's birth mother for choosing them to raise her son as their own 

The statement was posted at around 6pm naming Peter's birth mother, Rhonda Schwindt, and his two siblings

'We know that she and Peter's siblings, Jana and Sam Schwindt, share in our grief.'

The 26-year-old former US Army Ranger was taken captive while on a humanitarian mission to Syria in October 2013. 

On November 16, ISIS released a graphic video showing that Kassig, who had converted to Islam while in captivity, had been beheaded.

Kassig's adoptive parents issued a statement Monday from their home in Indianapolis talking about the enormity of their loss and asking for prayers, but until today, nothing was known about the aid worker's biological family.

According to a report by WTHR, Peter/Abdul-Rahman Kassig reunited with his birth family only eight years ago, not long after his 18th birthday.

According to her Facebook page, Kassig’s mother, Rhonda Schwindt, works as an assistant professor at Indiana University School of Nursing.

Reunited: Peter, seen here in the center surrounded by his birth family, reached out to them when he turned 18 years old 

Mother's anguish: Rhonda Schwindt posted this message on Facebook less than a week before her son's execution 

Special bond: Peter was very close to his sister, Jana (pictured), whom he nicknamed 'Little Punk' 

Touching moment: After Kassig's murder, his younger brother, Sam Schwindt, shared online this old photo of himself as a boy with Peter dressed in his US Army Rangers uniform 

Schwindt has a college-age son and daughter, and she lives in Indianapolis with her new husband.

On November 11, less than a week before the release of the gruesome ISIS video, Mrs Schwindt wrote on her Facebook wall: ‘I want my son Peter home safely.’

Peter Kassig's younger brother, 18-year-old Sam Schwindt, is currently a freshman at DePaul University in Chicago.

On Thursday, Sam posted an old photo of himself as a young boy standing next to his big brother in his US Army Rangers uniform in front a monument engraved with 'Ranger Creed.'

A day after the ISIS video recording was made public online, Sam shared a moving tribute to Kassig on his Facebook page.

'It's incredibly strange to lose someone you love,' he wrote. 'It just does not seem real. It always seems like in life that there will be more time, but you really can never know.

Correspondence: Jana, pictured with her mother on Graduation Day, has received a letter from Peter during his captivity in Syria - one of only two letters home he was able to write 

Family ties: Sam Schwindt, 18, is a freshman at DePaul University. His 20-year-old sister, Jana, works as a kennel attendant at the Indianapolis Humane Society

Regret: Just two days before Peter Kassig was captured by ISIS, he was supposed to have a video chat with Sam (left), but the teen ended up canceling because he had other plans at the time 

'Just please, for me, if you're not talking to someone you love, send them a message and reconnect. You never know when you may lose someone. I will always love you, Peter.'

Much like her big brother, Jana Schwindt, 20, has dedicated her life to humanitarian work.

Since August of this year, the 20-year-old has been working as a kennel attendant at the Indianapolis Humane Society.

‘True to how Peter lived his life, Jana has wanted to stay very busy, so she's been coming to work and working with our animals at our west side facility and continuing to live this compassion that is in this family,’ Humane Society COO Kirsten VantWoud told WTHR.

This weekend, the Schwindts will hold a private remembrance ceremony for family and friends to honor Kassig's legacy.

Believer: Peter Kassig, shown here working in Syria, converted to Islam while in captivity and took the given name Abdul-Rahman

No idle threat: Kassig is pictured with ISIS executioner Jihadi John, who threatens to behead him in a video for the terror group

Speaking to The Indianapolis Star, Jana and Sam Schwindt revealed that when Peter turned 18 years old, he reached out to them for the first time.

Even though they only got to spend eight short years together, the three siblings reportedly developed a very close bond.

According to Jana Schwindt, her big brother dubbed her 'Little Punk' and loved staying up late to watch the sitcom Elf with her.

He even sent Jana a letter while being held hostage by ISIS - only one of two missives he was able to write home from his captivity.

Just days before Kassig was captured in Syria in October 2013, he was supposed to have a video chat with Sam, his ‘Little Bro,’ but the teenager had to cancel because he had made plans with friends - a decision he regrets to this day.
