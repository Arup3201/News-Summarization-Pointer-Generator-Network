Livid: Margaret Horton has been left with severe
bruising following the savage attack by a pack of dogs near her home in
Stoke-on-Trent

A grandmother was left with shocking injuries after she was viciously attacked by a pack of sheep dogs and Jack Russells who knocked her to the ground and tore at her helpless body.

Margaret Horton, 75, was just yards from the front door of her home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, when the five dogs pounced.

The out-of-control animals snapped at the frail pensioner's ankles until she fell face first onto the pavement. They then savaged her legs and hands before passers-by managed to fight the dogs off.

Mrs Horton, who had to spend the night in hospital after the attack, was left with grotesque bruising around her left eye and needed skin grafts to replace the torn skin on her legs.

Recounting the nightmare ordeal, the grandmother-of-one said: 'It was absolutely horrendous. There was nothing I could do.

'I just felt their teeth sink into my legs.

'I was covered in blood and I can’t sleep because I am in so much pain.

'You can put two full fingers into one of the wounds because it is so deep.

'I have been a dog lover all my life but I want these dogs destroyed.'

Mrs Horton was set upon as she walked home at 8.40pm last Wednesday.

She was just yards from her front door when three Collie dogs and two Jack Russells pounced on her.

Her screams alerted neighbours who ran to her aid and managed to scare off the animals.

Margaret was kept in the University Hospital of North Staffordshire overnight and had to cancel a holiday to Majorca because her injuries were so bad.

She added: 'I’m normally up and about, but this has really upset me.

'I’m just glad it wasn’t a child who was attacked.

'Those dogs would have killed it.

'The policeman told me he had never seen a dog bite like it in 16 years of policing.'

'I just felt their teeth sink into my legs': Mrs
Horton, 75, was attacked just yards from her front door as she walked 
home from a friend's house last Wednesday evening

Neighbour Valerie Lambert, 70, said: 'They were like a pack of wild dogs. It was terrifying to see her like that.'

Two people have been arrested and three of the animals have been seized and placed in kennels as part of the police investigation.

A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'Officers are continuing to pursue lines of inquiry.

'A 51-year-old man and a 40-year-old woman have been arrested in connection with the incident and have been bailed, pending further inquiries.

'Three dogs have also been seized from a nearby property and are being kept in kennels.'
