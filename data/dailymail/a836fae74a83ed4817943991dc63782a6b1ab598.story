To seasoned Robert Mugabe watchers who have to reach for a pair of sunglasses every time he puts in a personal appearance, this might come as a bit of a surprise.

For the 87-year-old Zimbabwean tyrant has agreed for his signature to be used with a new fashion label in a bid to reach out to younger voters.

The news - unlikely to send a shiver through the fashion houses of Milan and Paris - was been reported in gushing tones by the Zimbabwe Broadcast Corporation which said demand had already been high after the fashion line was launched in the capital, Harare.

The network reported: 'A new fashion stable, House of Gushungo, whose label is President Robert Mugabe's signature, has hit the capital by storm.

If you like this, you'll just love my latest fashion line: Robert Mugabe gestures during a tree-planting ceremony while sporting a interesting take on the Hawaiian shirt. It appears to have a pictures of him as a young man (top left of shirt), a cow being milked (bottom left) and the wheels of a steam train (peeking out from under the paper in his hand)

The looks that's taking Harare by storm, apparently. No prizes for spotting Mugabe's signature - it covers the entire chest area of this House of Gushongo T-shirt in stylish black

'The newly formed House of Gushungo clothing stable has introduced a new clothing line from the Head of State and Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, President Robert Mugabe's signature.

'The clothing stable is set to redefine the country's fashion industry which is mostly dominated by foreign clothing labels.

'The contemporary line appeals to today's modern men and women, offering style, comfort and a splash of attitude.'

Attempts by Mugabe -  rumoured to be suffering from prostate cancer - to reach out to the young are not new.

Last month it emerged that Mugabe is to appear in pop songs by a local band linked to Zimbabwe's information minister Webster Shamu.

The ZBC reported that the line of Mugabe clothing was launched recently by a Zimbabwean company Yedu Nesu Holdings.

The firm's range is designed for men and women and includes formal clothes, t-shirts, winter wear, jackets and caps.

Mugabe's signature is emblazoned on every item to allow their wearers to demonstrate their support for the freedom fighter-turned dictator.

Label boss Nicholas Munyonga said the range had been designed to honour Mugabe after his three decades of power.

He told ZBC: 'We decided to come up with something that is long lasting, something that will last for ever and in honour of the our President.'

The news has been interpreted by some as part of an attempt by Mugabe to appeal to young voters.

Mugabe has led Zimbabwe since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.

But in recent years he has seen support for his Zanu-PF party collapse after the country's once-booming economy went into meltdown.

At the last presidential election in 2008 Mugabe suffered the indignity of losing in the first round of polling to the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.

He later claimed victory in a controversial run-off poll after Mr Tsvangirai withdrew from the race amid widespread political violence.

The two men later formed an uneasy unity government which has theoretically controlled Zimbabwe since February 2009.

However Mugabe has repeatedly spoken of his desire to secure a fresh mandate for his own party to rule alone once again.

He was last week re-elected Zanu-PF leader and told the organisation's annual conference he planned to call new elections next year.

Some analysts believe he would be unable to secure sufficient support to win a free and fair election and could resort to intimidation and terror in an attempt to shore up his support.

Zanu-PF leaders are also reportedly worried that Mugabe's advancing years could count against him at the polls.

The octogenarian has recently faced repeated rumours about his failing health and is believed to be suffering from prostate cancer.
