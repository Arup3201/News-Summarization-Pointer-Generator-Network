They were greeted by a small army of young, smiling faces.

Ninety-one soldiers from 19th Regiment Royal Artillery, known as The Highland Gunners, were yesterday given a heroes' welcomeÂ by family and friends at Tidworth Barracks in Wiltshire.

Chief among those gathered were children patiently waiting for their fathers to greet them after six months apart.

Home at last: A young girl holding a Union Flag hugs her father as soldiers from The Highland Gunners fall-out on the parade square and are reunited with their families

To loud cheers, the soldiers first marched onto the parade square led by a lone piper. Once dismissed, they then rushed to embrace their loved ones.

The regiment was returning home after a six-month tour of duty across Helmand Province.

The Highland Gunners played a 
significant role in mentoring and monitoring the Afghanistan National 
Police and the Afghan National Army.

Its efforts have assisted the country to make significant progress in achieving security for its people, Army chiefs said.

Warrant officer Chris Hay, 37, from Forfar, was met by his wife Ami, 27, and son Aidan, three.

He
said: 'To come home to a welcome like this is amazing. It makes it all 
worthwhile with this kind of support that they give us.

'It has been a long hard six months but the support you get from the guys around you at work makes it a successful tour.'

Not long now: Families and friends hold flags and balloons as they take photographs of the parading soldiers

Also marching onto the parade square was Lieutenant Jessica Hinton, 27, from the Isle of Wight.

She said: 'It is brilliant to be back, cold, but awesome to see family and friends, loved ones and little ones.

'Throughout the tour families have sent out parcels and it is great to have a proud family waiting for you when you get home.

'I
am very proud to have served in Afghanistan, the comradeship has been excellent and there has been a real support 
network and friendships made that will last a lifetime.'

The regiment will now be taking a 
well-earned period of leave, before gathering again at its barracks in 
Wiltshire for an Operational Medals parade next month.
