Dennis Rodman has denied reports that North Korean despot Kim Jong Un had his own uncle executed in a purge.

The former NBA star, known in the past for his tattoos, piercings and wild behaviour, and now for his bizarre friendship with Kim, insisted in an interview the uncle was still alive.

His denial comes despite reports carried on North Korea's own state media that Jang Song Thaek was executed in December for 'anti-state acts'.

Speaking in an interview with luxury U.S. magazine DuJour, Rodman said: 'You could say anything here about North Korea and people would believe it.

'The last time I went there, when they said they killed his girlfriend, they killed his uncle, they just fed him to the dogs ... They were standing right behind me.'

The journalist conducting the interview, Lindsay Silberman, asked him to clarify, pointing out that the North Korean regime has made clear the uncle was executed – but Rodman repeated the claim.

'He was standing right there,' Rodman said.

Kim's uncle Jang, once considered a mentor to the young supreme leader, was arrested, swiftly tried for treason and executed on December 12, according to state media.

Rodman has been accused of being duped
 by Pyongyang and pandering to the North Korean leader, singing 'Happy 
Birthday' to Kim at an exhibition basketball game and dismissing 
evidence of rampant rights abuses and repression.

But
 he insisted Kim wants to hold discussions with President Barack Obama 
and has told him the North has nuclear weapons because it is a small 
country that has to defend itself.

'He really, really wants to talk to Obama. He can't say it enough,' Rodman said.

'He's saying that he doesn't want to bomb anybody. He said, 'I don't want to kill Americans.' He loves Americans.'

Rodman's interview comes as pressure 
is mounting on North Korea, which appears to be preparing to stage a 
fourth nuclear test in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, arms
 experts and US officials say.

Rodman visited North Korea three times last year, in February, March and December, but he said he had been threatened with sanctions by Washington if he continued his activities in the country.

'When
 I [next] go there, it’s going to be a problem coming back,' he said. 
'Because they could actually stop me from coming back. They could 
actually pull my passport. They already told me that. They’re afraid of 
me because I know so much.'

The North Korean leader is reported to be a huge fan of basketball and especially of the Chicago Bulls, with whom Rodman won three NBA titles alongside Michael Jordan in the 1990s.

He prompted outrage in January when he suggested in an interview with CNN that a Korean-American Christian tour operator was to blame for his imprisonment in North Korea.

He later apologised and blamed his outburst on heavy drinking, checking into a rehab facility in New Jersey.

Of his alcoholism, Rodman has said: 'I've always been a party animal (and) the reason I drink is because I'm bored.'
