Hail to the chief: Egypt's former army chief Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi has been sworn in as the country's new president amid tight security in Cairo

Egypt's former army chief Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi has been sworn in as president amid tight security.

The field marshal’s inauguration in Cairo yesterday came less than a year after he ousted elected president Mohammed Morsi, following protests against his rule in which hundreds were killed.

The day was declared a national holiday – as soldiers in armoured vehicles kept order in the city.

Mr al-Sisi, 59, took the oath of office for his four-year term at the Supreme Constitutional Court as Morsi did two years ago.

Morsi and other members of his radical Muslim Brotherhood party are now on trial for charges that carry the death penalty.

Mr al-Sisi said: ‘Throughout its extended history . . . our country has never witnessed a democratic peaceful handover of power. The time has come to build a more stable future.’

He entered court with interim president Adly Mansour, who will return to his post as chief justice.

The building, designed to look like an ancient Egyptian temple, is a short distance away from a military hospital where longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, toppled by the 2011 uprising, is being held.

Forced out of office after 29 years in power, Mubarak was convicted last month on graft charges and sentenced to three years in prison. He is also being retried over the killing of protesters during the 18-day revolt.

Sunday was declared a national holiday for Mr al-Sisi's inauguration and police and troops deployed throughout Cairo. The entire Cabinet, as well as Mr al-Sisi's wife and children, attended the swearing-in ceremony.

Mr al-Sisi is Egypt's eighth president since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1953, the year after a military coup.

With the exception of Morsi and two civilians who served in an interim capacity, all of Egypt's presidents have come from the armed forces.

A 21-gun salute greeted al-Sisi as he arrived at the Ittiahdiya presidential palace in Cairo's upscale district of Heliopolis after being sworn in.

He welcomed dozens of local and foreign dignitaries, including the kings of Jordan and Bahrain, the emir of Kuwait and the crown princes of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, the largest and wealthiest of the seven sheikdoms that make up the United Arab Emirates.

The five Arab nations backed al-Sisi's ouster of Morsi. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Emirates since have provided billions of dollars to shore up Egypt's ailing finances.

Mr al-Sisi won a landslide victory in presidential elections held last month, receiving nearly 97 percent of the vote, with a turnout of 47.45 percent.

The three-day election was declared free of fraud but was tainted by the extraordinary means used by authorities to get the vote out, including a threat to fine those who stayed home, a one-day voting extension, and allowing free rides on trains and buses to encourage voters to travel to their home districts to cast their ballots.

It was also held against a backdrop of vastly curbed freedoms in the 11 months since Morsi's ouster and a massive crackdown on supporters of his Muslim Brotherhood, hundreds of whom have been killed in clashes with security forces.

Morsi's supporters boycotted the vote and have also called for massive demonstrations to mark Morsi's July 3 ouster, though their ranks have thinned considerably.

The pro-military media has meanwhile demonised not only the Brotherhood but also secular icons from the 2011 uprising.

Morsi's Islamist backers - thousands of whom have been jailed since his ouster - accuse Mr al-Sisi of crushing Egypt's infant democracy.

Many of the secular youths behind the 2011 uprising say he has revived Mubarak's police state, pointing to a law passed last year that restricts protests as well as the jailing of a number of well-known activists.

In interviews, Mr al-Sisi made it clear that his priorities are security and the economy, maintaining that free speech must take a back seat while he fights Islamic militants and works to revive the ailing economy.

But while many support Mr al-Sisi's fight against the militancy, his plans for the economy have generated less enthusiasm. He has advocated heavy government involvement in the economy, with state-sponsored mega-projects to create jobs and the government setting prices for some goods. At the same time, he has vowed to be business-friendly and encourage investment.

He has spoken of reshaping the map of Egypt by expanding Nile provinces into the desert to make way for development outside the densely populated river valley.

His answer for funding his projects is billions of dollars from oil-rich Gulf nations and Egyptian expatriates.
