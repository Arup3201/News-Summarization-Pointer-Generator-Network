Schools are pushing up violent crime figures by reporting petty playground squabbles to police, a senior officer has claimed.

Sir Jon Murphy, Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, said fights between boys, or girls pulling each other’s hair are no longer dealt with by teachers.

Instead, staff are reporting minor incidents in playgrounds and classrooms to the police – driving an increase in one of the less serious categories of violent crime.

Official statistics show the figures for assault without injury are on the rise, but the Department for Education denied schools were to blame.

Sir Jon, who has been in the police for 40 years, was asked by local TV station Bay TV Liverpool why violent crime was increasing. He said: ‘What has actually arisen, and it’s risen sharply, is what is referred to as violent assault without injury.

‘When you and I went to school, if a couple of boys had a fight in the playground, that would be dealt with by the school and it would never come out of the school.

‘If it was two girls pulling each other’s hair, that would never be reported to the police. 

'A whole host of physical interactions between people – sometimes it’s a punch where there’s no real injury – are reported to the police in a way that they never were.’

Official figures back up Sir Jon’s claim that more minor assaults are being recorded. 

After years of dramatic falls that had baffled experts, latest statistics show that violent crime is on the rise across England and Wales.

The Office for National Statistics said violent crime was up 16 per cent in the year to September 2014 – although it could be that these figures are simply more accurate than previous totals, following claims that many offences were being ignored.

Detailed figures seen by The Mail on Sunday show that there has been a sharp rise in the category of ‘assault without injury’, a type of common assault.

A decade ago there were 241,229 such offences recorded by police and by 2012-13 the figure had fallen to 198,390. 

But in the 12 months to September 2014, there were 238,753 assaults without injury – the highest number for nearly ten years.

Statistics show figures for assault without injury are on the rise and the Department for Education has denied schools are to blame. But official figures back up Sir Jon’s claim that more minor assaults are being recorded

Home Office rules describe assault without injury as ‘an application of force which generates a feeling of touch or a passing moment of pain’.

Mike Hough, Professor of Criminal Policy at Birkbeck, University of London, said: ‘Jon Murphy is quite right that the increase in police-recorded violent crime is steepest for assault without injury.

‘My own belief is that the rise is a function not of real changes in crime, but arises from changes in recording practice. His schools point may be part of the explanation.’

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘We have not issued any guidance to schools on when they should call police to incidents. It is very rare for police to be called to schools.’
