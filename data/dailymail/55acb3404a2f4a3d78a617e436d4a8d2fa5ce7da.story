Thousands of schools will close for a day after unions  confirmed plans for a national strike next term.

The National Union of Teachers and NASUWT are staging the walkout in protest at Michael Gove’s planned reforms which they describe as a ‘relentless attack’ on the profession.

The strike will force many parents to take time off work to look after their children or pay for childcare.

The unions, which have already held 
industrial action in the North West, are planning two other regional 
walkouts before the national action across England and Wales.

Walkout: The NASUWT and NUT will stage industrial action across the country in October ahead of a national strike

The last nationwide one-day strike by 
teachers was in November 2011 when members of several unions joined 
other public sector workers in a walkout. In the current dispute the 
teaching unions are fighting a government cap on pay and planned reforms
to pensions and workload.

NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates 
said: ‘The Secretary of State needs to take seriously the very deep 
concerns and anger of teachers and school leaders.

‘The relentless attack on the teaching profession is damaging the morale of teachers and undermining the education of pupils.’

NUT general secretary Christine Blower
added: ‘Strike action is always a last resort for teachers and they are
very well aware of the difficulties that this causes for parents and 
pupils. Teachers, however, have been left no option.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has warned lessons should not be disrupted

‘If we do not take a stand now to 
defend the profession then the consequences for teacher recruitment and 
education will be disastrous.’

The unions, which represent 90 per 
cent of teachers, oppose the 1 per cent pay rise imposed on public 
sector workers and performance-related pay, which is being introduced  
this year. They also claim members are being subjected to ‘oppressive 
workloads’ and want plans to increase pension contributions to  be axed.

The unions approved industrial action after ballots that were only supported by a minority of teachers.

The first regional strike, in the 
North West on June 27,  affected around 2,700 schools. The next round of
strikes will take place in the East, East Midlands, West Midlands, 
Yorkshire, Humberside and parts of Wales in the week beginning September
30.

That will be followed by action in the
North East, London, South East, South West and Wales two weeks later. A
date has not been set for the national walkout. Mr Gove has met the 
unions but insisted he will not change course.

A Department for Education spokesman 
said: ‘We are very disappointed that the NUT and  NASUWT have announced 
they will be taking further strike action, which less than a quarter of 
teachers actually voted for.

‘Industrial action will disrupt 
pupils’ education, hugely inconvenience parents and damage the 
profession’s reputation in the eyes of the public at a time when our 
reforms are driving up standards across the country.’

Teachers used their annual conferences
in April to make demands including shorter working days and fewer 
inspections. Votes of no confidence in Mr Gove were also passed.

He responded by suggesting days should be longer and the length of terms increased.

The Education Secretary has also 
accused unions of reverting to a ‘1970s-style mentality’ with the 
strikes and work-to-rule action that is already affecting about one in 
ten schools.
