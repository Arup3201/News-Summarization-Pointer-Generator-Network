We came to Brazil with dreams of making our mark.

Instead England arrive home after the worst World Cup showing in the history of the national team.

Their credibility as a footballing power is shot to pieces after defeats by Italy and Uruguay and a lifeless 0-0 draw with Costa Rica.

The end of the world: Roy Hodgson walks onto the pitch after a dismal draw against Costa Rica

At the 
centre of the farce is manager Roy Hodgson, still in his job despite his
 failure and bizarrely claiming that England hadn’t been outplayed or 
outclassed.

He
 said: ‘All I can say is we haven’t been that fortunate here... we 
haven’t got the results. If you’re Iran, and you play with eight or nine
 behind the ball and make incredible stops and draw 0-0, you’ve had a 
great game. That’ll never be the case with England. The pressure for 
teams like England is greater.’

After this debacle, expectations have never been lower.
