The damning Senate Intelligence Committee report on post-9/11 interrogation techniques has cast a new pall over the 2012 film 'Zero Dark Thirty.'

Kathryn Bigelow's docudrama about the hunt for Osama bin Laden ignited controversy for, some said, implying that the 'enhanced' interrogation techniques of the detainee program helped lead to finding bin Laden. Bigelow claimed that torture was a part of the story that couldn't be ignored.

The Senate report released Tuesday found that the coercive techniques led to no unique intelligence.

After US Navy SEALs killed Osama bin laden in Pakistan in May 2011, top CIA officials secretly told lawmakers that information gleaned from brutal interrogations played a key role in finding him. A US Senate report now says that was not true

The director and producer of 'Zero Dark Thirty' Kathryn Bigelow has been criticized for including a scene in the film that claimed waterboarding was necessary to finding bin Laden

California Senator Diane Feinstein, the Democratic chair of the Intelligence Committee that released the report, had been one of the most vocal critics of 'Zero Dark Thirty.' 

In a 2012 letter to Sony Pictures co-signed by Republican Senator John McCain, Feinstein called the film 'factually inaccurate' and wrote that filmmakers had an obligation not to 'shape American public opinion in a disturbing and misleading manner.'

Bigelow was asked about the report on 'The Daily Show' on Tuesday while promoting a short film about elephant poaching and the ivory trade.

'We made the movie based on the reporting that we did,' said Bigelow. 'I applaud transparency in government, so I think it's good that it's out there. It's complicated. It's very, very, very complicated.'

The Associated Press was not immediately successful in its attempts to reach Bigelow on Wednesday.

Despite this 'Zero Dark Thirty' waterboarding scene, investigators revealed that there was no evidence enhanced interrogation the CIA to bin Laden

'Zero Dark Thirty' was made with a rare blend of traditional filmmaking and journalism. Bigelow collaborated with Mark Boal, a journalist and screenwriter who also penned their Oscar-winning 'The Hurt Locker.' ''Zero Dark Thirty,' made just a year after bin Laden's killing, was labeled as 'based on first-hand accounts of actual events.'

At the time of the film's release, then Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King, R-N.Y., claimed that Bigelow and Boal were given too much cooperation by the Pentagon. The Defense Department insisted that the filmmakers were only given a routine meeting and that no assistance was ever provided.

But 'Zero Dark Thirty' was hotly debated for its representation of the role of torture in pursuing bin Laden. In the film, a detainee identifies bin Laden's courier. When Obama shuts down the detainee program in the film, CIA officers complain about intelligence drying up.

Bigelow at the time insisted 'depiction is not endorsement' in a Los Angeles Times op-ed.

'I do wonder if some of the sentiments alternately expressed about the film might be more appropriately directed at those who instituted and ordered these U.S. policies, as opposed to a motion picture that brings the story to the screen,' wrote Bigelow.
