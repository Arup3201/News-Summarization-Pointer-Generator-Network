A clifftop house that was bought at auction without being seen or surveyed by the buyer has started to collapse after the latest in a series of devastating landslides.

Ridgemont House, which lies just yards from the edge of Oddicombe Cliffs in Torquay, Devon, has now begun to crumble and sag.

It made the news three years ago when a landslide hit it just a week after the six-bedroom property had been sold at auction to retired police officer Sue Diamond for £154,000.

Legal disputes are still thought to be ongoing and the house is fenced off.  Now, it is on the verge of total obliteration after the most recent landslide caused a large portion of it to collapse.

Miss Diamond, who is disabled, made a telephone bid of £154,500 for the house in February 2010, without viewing it or having a survey done.  Eight days later, a landslide left the 1930s house just 50 yards from a drop into the sea, and a lengthy legal battle began between her and the builder who sold it to her, Matthew Taylor.

At the time Miss Diamond, who suffers from dyslexia, impaired hearing and restricted mobility, said the house was uninhabitable and worth only £3,500.

The auction particulars had warned buyers that the house was severely structurally damaged and might be beyond economic repair, and a judge in 2010 ordered Miss Diamond to pay Mr Taylor what she owed.

Mr Taylor has a legal charge for the money, plus eight per cent interest annually, over Miss Diamond's home in Chiswick, West London, which she says is worth over £1million.

Explaining her decision to buy the house in Torquay, she said her Chiswick home had been flooded by burst pipes and she thought the ground floor of the seaside property would be ideal for a disabled person.

Just before the most recent landslide in Torquay, a man who lives near the clifftop house explained why he was selling up.

Going, going: Ridgemont House looks like it won't last much longer following the latest incident in the three-year story of a collapsing dream home

Before the clifftop began crumbling into the sea, Ridgemont House was an attractive 1930s-built seaside residence of grand proportions

Les Watson, 68, whose neighbouring property is for sale, said: 'We're selling up because it is too big for us and we're going to downsize in Torquay.

'We have lived here nine years and love it here but it is too much for us to manage.

'So many people have come to view it.  Our neighbours moved here earlier this year so they weren't put off by the risk of a landslide. I don't think it will go for years.'

Another neighbour, a 40-year-old woman who didn't want to be named, said she has been renting her house since March.

She said: 'We came here because of the location and the house: it's got a great sea view.

'We didn't know anything about the landslide, we found out from neighbours.  There are concerns about Ridgemont House being derelict because it encourages people.

'It's a bit of a tourist attraction at weekends: lots of kids come and nose around the house.

'We are all concerned about potential increased burglary, and we've had to call the police a couple of times because of kids hanging around acting suspiciously.

'The possibility of a major landslide worries me slightly.  I wouldn't buy this place because of the risk. It's quite a way from the edge, but if there's another one or two landslides these houses will be next to go.'

Doomed: The property (seen here in 2010) was sold to Miss Diamond by a builder, Matthew Taylor, who has been engaged in a legal battle with her ever since the house's garden fell down the cliff a week after she bought it
