A top technology guru at the Department of Health and Human Services told Congress on Tuesday that the government is nowhere near ready to close the deal on new Obamacare signups, with just '60 to 70 per cent' of the website's internal engine built so far.

HHS has promised that the website will be full functional by November 30, although White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the Obama administration would consider the effort successful if four out of five consumers could successfully enroll in insurance plans.

Testimony from Henry Chao, the Deputy Chief Information Officer at HHS's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, indicates that this is because the government's tech gurus still can't process payments.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Henry Chao, the deputy chief information officer at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, testified that more than half of the Obamacare website's back-end computer processing systems are still unfinished

Inquisitor: Colorado Republican Rep. Cory Gardner was shocked to learn how little of the Obamacare website's back-end was ready for launch

'We still need to build the payments systems to make the payments to [insurance policy] issuers in January,' Chao told members of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

Under questioning by Colorado Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, he said more than half of the tech systems that operate behind the scenes when consumers shop for insurance at healthcare.gov still aren't completed.

'How much do we have to build today, still?' Gardner asked. 'I mean, what do we need to build? 50 per cent? 40 per cent? 30 per cent?'

'I think it's – uh, just an approximation,' Chao answered, 'we're probably sitting somewhere about 60 and 70 percent.'

'Unbelievable': Gardner was incredulous to learn how much of the Obamacare system still lacks the computer support to process payments and keep the books

An incredulous Gardner asked him to confirm that the '60 to 70 per cent' number represented the incomplete sections of the website. Chao didn't dispute the number, but the Department of Health and Human Services did later in the day, telling Buzzfeed that the numbers were reversed.

Chao also clarified that the consumer portion – what Americans see when they visit the website – is '100 per cent there.'

Those functions include the capacity for consumers to complete a basic enrollment in the Obamacare system, compare health care plans and determine their eligibility for government subsidies.

But 'the back office systems, the accounting systems [and] the payment systems,' he conceded, are not ready for prime time.

Those systems include one that makes government subsidy payments directly to insurance companies on behalf of consumers who qualify.

When the federal government released statistics on November 13 showing the number of Americans who had selected health insurance plans through healthcare.gov, it omitted any mention of how many had made actual purchases.

HHS released Obamacare signup numbers but didn't say how many people made policy payments – because they can't process them
