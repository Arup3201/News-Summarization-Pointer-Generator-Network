Brendan Rodgers offered hints as to how he will handle Mario Balotelli when the £16m striker completes his move to Liverpool over the weekend.

The manager did not offer any updates on how the Italian striker's move from Milan was progressing, opening his press conference with: 'I can categorically tell you that I can't speak about him.'

But he then went on to allay any fears about the controversial striker's behaviour by saying he will adhere to the club's 'intensive' code of conduct.

'We have an intensive code of conduct for any member of staff here,' Rodgers said. 'That covers everyone, not one particular individual.

'Nothing will ever shake our fantastic environment. We've got a learning environment for players.'

Balotelli was heading to Merseyside on Friday to complete his medical after personal terms were agreed with the player and his agent.

He won't be eligible to make his Liverpool debut against former club Manchester City on Monday night, however, as the registration deadline of midday has passed.

Rodgers went on to say he believes Balotelli will go from strength to strength at Anfield: 'Every player we assess. Character is very important. No player will come in of they don't fit.

'People who know me well will tell you I try to develop the person as well as the player. As long as they show they care and they want to develop, we can help them.

'Players come in all shapes and sizes. Two years ago I couldn't have brought in a player who was risk. You have got to weight it up. This is a club that is different to most. This is a club with values and ethics. 

'We understand that sometime you have to take a risk and if you take a risk you can get your reward. Our team spirit is very strong and it got us through the game last week. You will fight for each other when the squad is close.'

Rodgers added that Liverpool will go to the Etihad and try and win on Monday night.

'We'll go to Man City with no fear, as we've done before. We'll attack the game.

'The title is decided over the course of the 38 games, not just the big games like Monday's. But the aim is to perform and win.

'The nature of both teams is the offensive game, but they're normally tight games. Both teams will want to score. We know we need to press well and control the game. We can hurt teams, it'll be a good game for sure.'

THE PRESS CONFERENCE AS IT HAPPENED 

Host commentator

That's about everything from the Brendan Rodgers press conference this afternoon. We'll have a full write-up with all the quotes for you soon. 

On Balotelli and the pursuit of players: 'Sometimes you have to take a risk with people, but a lot of the time if you take that risk you get a reward for it. It's not easy finding new players as there's a small pool of players we could actually buy.

'But a lot of good work is going on. We're not plucking players out of the sky. A lot of hard work goes into finding and speaking to these players.' 

Rodgers has just outlined the team news ahead of the City clash. Lazar Markovic is set to return to the squad, while Adam Lallana will train with the team on Sunday. There are no guarantees he'll be available for the match, however. Jose Enrique is a maybe, but Daniel Agger and Jon Flanagan are still out.

Rodgers adds that Liverpool will go to the Etihad and try and win on Monday night.

'We'll go to Man City with no fear, as we've done before. We'll attack the game.

'The title is decided over the course of the 38 games, not just the big games like Monday's. But the aim is to perform and win.'

He adds: 'The nature of both teams is the offensive game, but they're normally tight games. Both teams will want to score. We know we need to press well and control the game. We can hurt teams, it'll be a good game for sure.'

Rodgers has not ruled out further additions to his squad before the close of the transfer window.

'If we can do deal for any more players that'll be great, but come the end of August I'm sure I'll be happy with what we've got.'

But when pushed about Balotelli's somewhat turbulent past, Rodgers replied: 'Every club will have a code of conduct. We have a fantastic environment and a great culture. Nothing will every shake that.'

There had been reports that Rodgers was drawing up a special code of conduct for the Italian striker, but the manager is making it clear he will follow the universal club policy. 

The press conference is just underway and Brendan Rodgers has made it 'categorically' clear that he cannot yet talk about Mario Balotelli.

'I can categorically tell you I can't speak about it before the player has signed,' he said.

That's that then...

Manuel Pellegrini has labelled Monday's clash with Liverpool a 'six-pointer'.

The Premier League champions welcome Brendan Rodgers' side to the Etihad after pipping them to the title last season.

And Pellegrini was in no doubt as to the importance of the fixture.
