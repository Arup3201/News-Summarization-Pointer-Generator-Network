New Aston Villa signing Carlos Sanchez insists he was desperate to join the club, but was convinced even further by fan favourite and fellow Colombian Juan Pablo Angel.

Villa completed the £4.7million deal for Sanchez on Monday on a four-year deal from Elche, their fifth signing of the summer.

And the 28-year-old said Angel, who played at Villa between 2001 and 2007, convinced him further that Villa was the place to be.

Sanchez told AVTV on his unveiling at Bodymoor Heath: 'I spoke to Juan Pablo Angel. He told me I absolutely had to come here to Villa.

'When I had the opportunity to come to Villa, I had no doubts. It's something I've always dreamed of, for me and my family.

'I've always dreamed of playing in the Premier League. I hope this is going to work really well.

'I've always followed English football particularly if there has been a Colombian playing here. He was a goalscorer and was very important at this club.

'I followed his time here because he was always scoring. For me the most imporant thing was the point the manager always wanted me to come here.

'I've got a feeling this is a family club, I'm looking forward to experiencing the atmosphere in the dressing room.'

Manager Paul Lambert, delighted after Villa's 1-0 win against Stoke on Saturday, was impressed with the midfielder in training on Monday.

'I’m sure he will find his feet pretty quickly,' said Lambert.

'Today I saw him up close and your eyes tell you within a minute that he’s going be a good player,

'You can see that by the way he plays the game.'
