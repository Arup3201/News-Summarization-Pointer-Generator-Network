Former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans has said that he could not have survived his court ordeal without the help of Coronation Street stars Bill Roache and Vicky Entwistle

Mr Evans told the Sunday Mirror that Mr Roache, who plays Ken Barlow in ITV soap Coronation Street, sent him a text after he learned that he had been acquitted.

He said it read: 'Just heard. Well done. And quite right too. The champagne will flow, xx.'

Mr Evans was also supported throughout the case by Coronation Street actress Vicky Entwistle, who played Janice Battersby in the ITV soap.

He said: 'Without my friends being there for me and giving me hope I would have been a broken man.'

He said that he and Mr Roache had exchanged messages during their trials, adding: 'That kind of absolute belief was what kept me going, not just from famous friends like Bill but from constituents and my family.'

The MP for Lancashire’s Ribble Valley was arrested in May.

It came after a member of staff accused him of rape after a night of what he believed to be consensual sex.

Later he was charged with eight other sexual offences against male colleagues between 2002 and 2013.

The MP, who stepped down as Deputy Speaker to fight the case at a personal cost of £200,000, wept as the jury found him not guilty, saying: 'Thank you'

In the interview he also said that the experience has made him more wary.

He said: 'I will be on my guard. I will worry when I go to touch someone. I’m afraid someone out there will try to set me up so I’ve now got to be aware on may levels as to how I behave.'

When asked if he had considered suicide, in an earlier interview, he said: ‘Yes, in my darkest moments. The pressure and despair were so great.'

Mr Evans, 56, mentioned Mr Roache as he spoke of his relief on the steps of Preston Crown Court after being cleared of rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted sexual assault and two indecent assaults.

He had earlier stood in the dock, hands clasped in front of him, listening to each not guilty verdict.

By the time he was cleared of the eighth count he couldn't contain his emotions no longer, his face crumpled and he began to weep, wiping away his tears with a white tissue.

As he was cleared of the ninth and final count his supporters in the gallery let out a gasp of relief and burst into tears.

The MP, who stepped down as deputy speaker to fight the case at a personal cost of £200,000, wept as the jury found him not guilty, saying: ‘Thank you.’

Outside court Mr Evans said he had gone through ‘11 months of hell’ and it was no time for celebration

He added: ‘Bill Roache just a few weeks ago from this very spot said there are no winners in these cases and that’s absolutely right.

'All I can say is that after the last 11 months that I’ve gone through, nothing will ever be the same again.’
