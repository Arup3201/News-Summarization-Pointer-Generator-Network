A girl who was abused by internet trolls online for being ginger has hit back at bullies by becoming a beauty queen.

Tormented Molly Glen, 12, often came home from primary school in floods of tears after being tripped up, punched and verbally abused by bullies simply because of her hair colour.

But even outside the classroom Molly, from Bathgate, West Lothian, could not escape from the torrent of abuse.

Molly has finally found confidence in her looks after joining Ashley Brown self-esteem model school

Despite the horrendous bullying and tragic loss of her father when she was just six-months-old, mother Mandy (left) said Molly had shown 'bravery beyond her years'

Like many girls her age she used social media sites but while chatting with friends she was trolled by cyber-bullies.

Fed-up with being the butt of jokes about having ginger hair, Molly joined Ashley Brown self-esteem model school and her life began to change for the better.

The 12-year-old said: 'The classes really helped my confidence. I met a lot of new friends who I still stay in touch with.'

Defiant Molly impressed leaders so much she was offered the chance to compete in the Junior Teen UK competition, and won a runner-up prize.

She is now gearing up to compete at Junior Teen Great Britain later this month.

Molly said: 'I'm really looking forward to competing in Blackpool and having my mum watching me in the crowd.

Proud mother Mandy, who raised her daughter on her own since her husband Ian died in 2002, said: 'Molly would come home from school and she'd barely say a word to me.

'I could tell something was wrong and she would tell me that some girls in her school had thrown stuff at her and would trip her up in class.

'She even suffered a lot of abuse online on sites. People would call her ugly and give her abuse for having ginger hair - it was really horrible.

'I was desperate to do something to help her and eventually she went to the Ashley Brown self-esteem model school.

'She made a few friends and it really seemed to boost her confidence.'

Despite the tragic loss of her father when she was just six-months-old, Mandy, a civil servant with HMRC, said Molly had shown 'bravery beyond her years'.

Speaking about a torrid time in the young girl's life, Mandy said: 'It was very difficult for her growing up and she still gets upset about it now.

'But at the end of the day, she's had the last laugh when it comes to the bullies.

'Our family and friends have always said she's got gorgeous red hair and to see her doing something she loves after taking so much abuse if incredible.

'I hope other people in her position can use her as an inspiration - I'm incredibly proud of her.'

Molly was recently named Little Miss Princess, a local competition in Bathgate in July, and will star next in the Junior Teen GB competition in Blackpool on August 29.
