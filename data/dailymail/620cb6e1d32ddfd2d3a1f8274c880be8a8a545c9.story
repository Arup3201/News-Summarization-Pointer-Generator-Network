Some good news for women who are accused of spending too much time at the shops: a new study has revealed that high street sprees are actually good for your health with women burning as many as 15,000 calories every year shopping.

British women walk 180 miles on average per year. That’s the same as seven marathons.

But it seems that for a third of women, all the hard work goes to waste because 33 per cent are snacking while shopping on 
calorific treats such as crisps, chocolate and biscuits.

Shop til you drop: Women walk 180 miles shopping per year, which is the equivalent to seven marathons

31 per cent of 
consumers admit to eating over 250 calories while pounding the 
pavements, with one in ten eating up to 1,000 calories.

The research also revealed that two thirds of women admit to being self-conscious in the changing rooms.

In fact, 27 per cent are so worried about fitting into their clothes on a shopping trip that they reduce portions or even skip meals beforehand.

What a waste! For a third of women, all the hard work goes to waste because 33 per cent of women snack while shopping on calorific treats such as crisps, chocolate and biscuits

And shopping with others just makes matters worse with more than a quarter claiming the company of friends is off putting, instead trusting the opinion of boyfriends and their mothers most.

And although more of us are shopping online than ever before – internet shopping sales grew by 8.7 per cent last year – it actually seems that more women are concerned with giving their bodies a work out along with their wallets.

The survey, carried out by Walls Solero Exotic, showed that while many women are tempted by the ease of online shopping, being able to count it as an exercise workout would encourage 58 per cent to hit the high street rather than the keyboard.
