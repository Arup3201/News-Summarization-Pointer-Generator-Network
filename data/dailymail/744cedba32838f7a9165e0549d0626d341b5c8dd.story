A Chinese man opened the emergency exit just before take off after wanting some 'fresh air'

The passenger was on board the Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu, and although cabin crew managed to diffuse the situation quickly and the flight took off on time, it is the latest incident to mar China flights.

As photos of the incident circulated online, it was met with disbelief.

'Just insane! Chinese passenger opens emergency door ‘to get fresh air’ as plane prepare to fly,' wrote George Chen on Twitter.

'Guy wants fresh air on a plane & tries to open an EMERGENCY EXIT MID-FLIGHT. This is a whole new division of stupid,' added Bongo.

Vision Times wrote on Twitter: 'This Definitely Isn’t a Good Reason for Opening the Emergency Exit on a Plane.' 

Only days before, a Chinese man had opened the emergency exit and deployed the slide after wanting to 'get off quicker' from his China Eastern flight MU2331 that has landed at Sanya Fenghaung International Airport in Hainan.

By activating the emergency exit, he deployed the emergency slide; the whole event caused an almost two-hour delay to the flight.

When asked why he had broken the rules, the passenger replied by saying he had 'wanted to get off the plane quicker.'

He also claimed he had not listened to the in-flight instructions, saying that he was not aware you couldn't use the emergency exit to disembark.

The on-board flight attendants tried in vain to prevent the slide from deploying, but were caught short.

The man's actions, not only caused delays to his fellow passengers, but is also estimated to have cost the airline £10,000 ($15,724). 

Prior to this, a Chinese woman scalded a flight attendant by throwing a cup of hot noodles after finding out she wouldn't be sat next to her boyfriend.

The incident occurred on a charter flight from Bangkok to Nanjing, China, and passengers were on hand to pull out their smartphones as the mid-air drama unfolded in front of them, snapping pictures as the injured flight attendant covered her face and shouted in pain. 

During the chaos a man believed to be the woman's boyfriend jumped out of his seat and angrily threatened to blow up the plane as the injured flight attendant was tended to by her co-workers.

But the man accused of making the threat later said the attendant was scalded by accident during a tussle over a receipt they had requested for the hot water.
