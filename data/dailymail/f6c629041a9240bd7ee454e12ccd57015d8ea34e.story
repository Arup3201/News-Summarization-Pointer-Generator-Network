The brother of film scion Mia Farrow has been arrested and charged for the alleged sexual assault and abuse of two children over an eight-year period, it emerged today.

John Charles Villers-Farrow, 66, was charged Wednesday with multiple offenses, including assault, child abuse, and sex offense after he turned himself into police.

Investigators believe that there could be additional victims beyond the two children who were allegedly abused between 2000 and 2008.

Mia Farrow's brother John Charles Villers-Farrow, 66, was charged Wednesday with assault, child abuse, and sex offense after two young men told authorities they had been abused

Villers-Farrow, who lives in Edgewater, Maryland, is being held on $800,000 bond at the Jennifer Road Detention Center.

Anne Arundel County police first began investigation the brother of Mia Farrow in August after receiving a tip that he was abusing children in the area, according to the Capital Gazette.

After police were informed of the possible abuse, two young men came forward, alleging that Villers-Farrow abused them, beginning in 2000 and ending in 2008. They said that Villers-Farrow had been their neighbor.

The 66-year-old turned himself into authorities Wednesday night.

As NBC Washington noted, this is not the first time he’s been in the public eye. In 1992, Villers-Farrow famously told PEOPLE magazine that Woody Allen, who had once been married to Farrow and fathered three of their children, would have serious legal trouble because of his relationship with her adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn.

Villers-Farrow said: ‘(He’s) going to be indicted, and he’s going to be ruined. I think when all of it comes out, he’s going to jail.’ Farrow’s brother was referred to at the time as ‘a sometime screenwriter and boat salesman outside Annapolis.’

Villers-Farrow spoke out on behalf of his sister Mia Farrow, pictured in 1990 with then boyfriend Woody Allen, when he left her for adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, pictured right with the director in 2011. He said Allen should be indicted for what he did

In total, Villers-Farrow is uncle to 11 of his sister’s adopted children, and her four biological children.

The bespectacled Allen, famous for his self-deprecating and neurotic on-film persona, began a romantic relationship with Farrow’s adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn, 34 years his junior.

Following the discovery of naked photos of Soon-Yi in Allen’s possession, Farrow split from Woody and launched a messy custody battle over their three children, Satchel, Dylan, and Moses.

During the proceedings, which were closely followed, Farrow claimed that Allen had sexually abused Dylan, though the judge dismissed the claims because they were not substantiated.

Farrow was awarded full custody, and Allen was denied visits with Dylan, who later changed her name to Malone.  The couple's other adopted child, Moshe, who changed his name to Moses, chose not to see Allen at all.

In a 2005 interview, Woody confirmed that he no longer has relationships with his three children from his relationship with the star of Hannah And Her Sisters.

'Well, I feel terrible about it. I spent millions of dollars and fought in court for years to do it, but could not swing it,' he told Vanity Fair.
