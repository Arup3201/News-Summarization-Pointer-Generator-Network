Nemanja Vidic had to be separated from team-mate Patrice Evra by former boss David Moyes as Manchester United's season descended into bickering and acrimony.

The furious bust-up came as United's players pored over replays of a 3-0 defeat by Liverpool at Old Trafford in March.

Vidic, who was sent off after receiving two yellow cards from referee Mark Clattenburg, accused Evra of neglecting his defensive duties by leaving him exposed.

The Frenchman is said to have exploded with anger and had to be restrained by Moyes and other members of staff as the incident threatened to boil over at United's Carrington training base.

Vidic, who is leaving United after more than eight years to join Inter Milan, has confirmed that the players fell out as their season lurched from one disappointment to another.

'We argued amongst ourselves,' admitted the United captain in an interview with the Daily Telegraph.

'This year more than any other, because when you have bad times, people show they care. We are still friends, but we were arguing to get better. We wanted to improve.

'We could say those things to each other because we have been together for so long, but it hurt. If you didn't argue, it would not be right. We had some hard moments in the dressing room between ourselves.'

Vidic and Evra, who joined United 
together in January 2006 from Spartak Moscow and Monaco respectively, 
have since settled their differences.

Evra could even join the Serb at 
Inter if he too decides to leave Old Trafford now his contract has 
expired, although a return to France with Paris Saint-Germain would 
appear more likely.

The two players have won five Premier League titles, the Champions League and three League Cups together at United, and Evra paid tribute to the man he calls 'The Rock' last week as Vidic prepared to make his final home appearance.

'I'm really sad because when I speak about Nemanja it's like I'm speaking about myself because we joined the club together,' said Evra.

'Our first game was for the reserves and it was so hard. Rene (Meulensteen) was the manager and he took us both out of the match.

'We were talking together in the dressing-room and saying, "Oh my god, why have we come to Manchester United? We should go back to our clubs quickly!"

'It was a difficult moment but we stuck together. We were in the same hotel, we went into training together, we won the same trophies. I’m really sad to lose The Rock.’
