Fears were growing tonight night for a mother who disappeared with her baby daughter.

Ali Zhao, 32, and 11-month-old Kiki left their home in picturesque Wimborne, Dorset yesterday at around 2.30pm.

Ms Zhao was 'upset' when she left home, according to police, who say they are 'increasingly concerned' for her and her daughter's welfare.

She was seen yesterday pushing her daughter in a four-wheeled buggy in the nearby village of Colehill.

Dorset Police are imploring the mother, who was described as very slim, 5ft 7in tall with long, straight black hair.

Inspector Bob Jacobs, of Dorset Police, said: 'We are becoming increasingly concerned for the welfare of Ali and Kiki as it is believed that Ali was upset when she left.

'I urge Ali to make contact with the police - we just want to make sure she and Kiki are safe and well.

'If anyone has any information about the whereabouts of Ali and Kiki please call 101 urgently'.
