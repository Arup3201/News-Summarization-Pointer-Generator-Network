A seven-year-old girl began hallucinating after she ‘overdosed’ on travel sickness travel pills during a school trip to the beach.

Chelsie Toms apparently accidentally took seven of the tablets instead of the recommended one on the day out with Mount Street Primary School in Devon, Plymouth.

Mother Wendy Toms, 28, was distraught when she picked her daughter up and found her incoherent.

'She was hallucinating, talking to the 
walls,' she Ms Toms.

'She didn’t know who I was and then she was sick in her hands. I 
was so worried that I looked through her schoolbag, to find the box of 
pills I gave to the staff member with seven missing.'

Hospitalised: Chelsie apparently took seven pills instead of one, thinking they were sweets

Ms Toms said she specifically told that staff 
member that Chelsie should be given half a tablet for the outward 
journey and half a pill on the return trip.

Chelsie had taken an extra six whole 
pills while queuing up to leave school at the end of the day after they had been put back into her schoolbag, claimed Ms Toms.

It appeared she ate them ‘thinking they were sweets’.

Ms Toms took Chelsie to hospital for tests and scans and she was kept in overnight. The girl has been taken out of school for now.

A Devon and Cornwall police spokesman 
said they were contacted about the incident and were investigating and referred it on to the Child Protection Service.

The school is now dealing with the matter internally and has confirmed it has put new procedures in place related to non prescription medicines.

Ms Toms said her daughter now needs 
counselling after the incident on June 28 because the hallucinations had
left her petrified of her own toys and unable to sleep without taking a
torch to bed.

Headteacher Sandie Roberts said the incident has been fully investigated and more robust procedures put in place.

She said: 'The school's highest priority is the safety and welfare of all our pupils. We take all complaints very seriously and the matter has been fully investigated.

'The police were satisfied that the incident could be handled by the school and a full investigation was carried out and the appropriate action taken. 

'The investigation found the travel sickness tablets were kept by a staff member at all times throughout the day and only returned to the child’s book bag as she was leaving school to meet her mother.

'Our original policy detailed robust procedures for prescription medication. Since this incident, it has been updated to include equally robust procedures for non-prescription medication to ensure the ongoing safety of our children.'
