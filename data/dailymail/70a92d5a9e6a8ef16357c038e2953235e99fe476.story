Buried among nearly 10,000 pages of documents made public Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library is an email that shows a future Supreme Court Justice dropping an F-bomb in official correspondence with her boss.

Elena Kagan, then assistant White House counsel, emailed an apology to her boss in May 1996 for chatting up a CNN host about an on-air debate that would be embarrassing to the president – while her colleague was actively trying to get the broadcast segment cancelled.

'I realize now that I may have really f**ked up,' she wrote to White House counsel Jack Quinn, adding: 'God, do I feel like an idiot.'

Kagan, who would get a spot on the nation's highest court from President Barack Obama in 2010, served in the Clinton administration when its sex-related legal brush fires were their hottest.

One of those episodes, which White House insiders called 'bimbo eruptions,' involved Paula Jones, an Arkansas woman who accused Clinton of luring her to a suite at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock while he was the state's governor.

During their short encounter, she claimed, Clinton had touched her inappropriately, tried to kiss her, dropped his trousers and asked her for oral sex.

Clinton denied ever having met Jones and a federal judge dropped criminal charges, calling the alleged behavior 'boorish.'

But a civil lawsuit dredged up the matter a second time. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a siting president wasn't allowed to duck it, but a federal judge threw out the case.

Jones vowed to appeal; Clinton ultimately paid an $850,000 settlement in 1998 to make the suit go away, just as Jones' lawyers surfaced a witness to testify on her behalf.

The Jones scandal inspired t-shirts, magazine features, song parodies – including take-offs on Grammy winner Billy Paul's 'Me And Mrs Jones' – and endless televised talking-head debates.

As the lawsuit wore on, CNN's 'Crossfire' wanted in on the action, asking former Clinton White House Counsel Abner Mikva to appear in a debate against then-Republican Colorado Senator Hank Brown.

Kagan and her boss Quinn had been talking with Crossfire host Bill Press about Mikva's segment, not understanding that Clinton Special Counsel Jane Sherburne was working back-channels with a CNN producer to have the entire thing called off.

Citing what she called a 'right-hand-left-hand' problem, Sherburne told Kagan she was unable to scotch the debate.

And the future justice acknowledged in her note to Quinn that when Sherburne had called her that morning with strategic questions about where the interview plan stood, she missed cues about what the special counsel was up to. 

'I am really really sorry about not telling you about this,' Kagan wrote. 'Frankly, it just didn't occur to me as at all important until this recent right-hand-left-hand conversation. God, do I feel like an idiot.'
