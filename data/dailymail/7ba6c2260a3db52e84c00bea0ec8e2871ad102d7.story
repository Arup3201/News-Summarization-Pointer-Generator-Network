They hugged, shed a few tears and he told his mother how happy he was to be back in the land of the living.

Sam Woodhead, the 18-year-old British public schoolboy who had been lost in the unforgiving Australian outback for three days, was reunited with his mother, 54-year-old Claire Derry, today in the tiny Queensland hospital where he is recovering from his ordeal

Miss Derry said she told her son: ‘I didn’t think I would ever be holding you in my arms again. He’s an incredibly lucky man and we’re incredibly lucky that people kept looking as long as they did.

Safe: Claire Derry arriving in Australia today to see her son Sam Woodhead who went missing after going for a run at a remote ranch in Queensland and surviving for three days in 40C heat

‘He knows how lucky he is – that searchers did not give up looking for him.'

Miss Derry was speaking after listening to 
her son’s description of his lost days as they sat together in the 
hospital in the outback town of Longreach.

Earlier she had revealed her son survived by drinking his own urine and contact lens solution he was carrying in his backpack when he set out for a run from a cattle station near Longreach last Tuesday.

While he still needs another 24 hours under hospital care before doctors will consider allowing him to leave, he was able to tell his mother how he kept hoping for rescue as dehydration and exhaustion took their toll on him in the near-40c desert heat.

The demands on his body were so intense 
that he lost 15 kilograms in those three days, but it was his fitness 
that kept him alive, his mother said.

He was not able to stand when they met in hospital, she revealed, but other than that ‘he looks fantastic.’

She added: 'He’s still very weak but he looks well. He must have the constitution of an ox.

‘I was shocked at his thinner frame, but pleasantly surprised that he doesn’t look too much the worse for wear.’

His arms are sunburned and he is covered in scratches, but there were no other visible physical injuries.’

But Ms Derry said that doctors had told her that there might be internal problems for the teenager because his kidneys are not quite functioning normally and his blood’s not normal.

'But the doctors say that’s completely typical of someone’s who’s been completely dehydrated,’ she said.

Fly to safety: Sam is taken to the waiting chopper, ending his three-day ordeal

The British backpacker had kept himself alive by drinking contact lens solution, said his mother

She laughed with him as he repeated the story he had told her over the phone earlier in the morning about his rescuers as she prepared to fly from Brisbane to Longreach.

He recalled the moment when two helicopter crew approached him as his strength was ebbing away

‘They took the p--- out of me Mum,’ he told her. ‘They said they normally find people out here with their eyes pecked out (by eagles and crows). I had to laugh.’

When she first spoke to him over the phone as she prepared to fly to Longreach she said Sam had sounded weak and had not been able to keep any food down.

But he managed to say how grateful he was to have been rescued.

Happy: Claire Derry with her son's former nanny Katrina Brown who met at Brisbane when Miss Derry flew into Australia

‘All he could say was “Mum, just thank these wonderful people. I’ve loved Australia from the minute I arrived here…these people are extraordinary.”’

Survival: Sam's mother said he survived his ordeal because he was 'incredibly fit'

Ms Derry said she had no doubt that Sam’s survival was due to his fitness and previous training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

‘Sam is physically incredibly fit – that was something I clung on to,’ she said. ‘He wants to go into the Royal Marines or Army.’

A helicopter crew searching for the teenager had passed over him several times but had been unable to see him, Brisbane’s Sunday Mail reported early today (Sun).

‘We were on our last pass before breaking off for fuel, when we spotted him,’ said Queensland rescue officer John Chate.

‘Sam had moved himself into a semi-clear area which had scattered shrubs, basically rough terrain. He was a bit unstable but on his feet.’

When the helicopter crew spotted him, Sam was wearing a dirty white T-shirt and a backpack with a small amount of clothes he had used as a shelter from the sun.

He was unable to stand and had to be winched into the helicopter.

Rescuers said they had learned from Mr Woodhead that when he realised he was lost he curled up on the ground for the night.

In the first few hours of darkness and tried to find his way back to the cattle station at dawn before the heat of the sun struck him.

He sheltered as much as he could as he tried to work out which way to walk – before night came and once again he just lay down and tried to snatch some sleep.

Aspirational: Sam had travelled to Australia around four weeks ago to work as a ranch hand which he hoped would help him with his training to be an Army officer

Ms Derry, who had flown from her home 
in Richmond, Surrey, learned that he had been found alive when airline 
crew passed a message to her.

She was so overjoyed that she hugged one of the stewards – and then the crew brought her champagne to celebrate.

Speaking on her arrival in Australia, Miss Derry said the news ended 'the worst three days of my life'.

'Sam
is fearless and wants to go into the Marines or the Army and it was 
because he was training to be ready for his interview with them that he 
was trying to keep fit all the time,’ she told ITV

'He’s
watched programmes and videos on the Marines and that’s why he would 
have known a lot about survival and why we were fairly hopeful but we 
got less hopeful as time went on.'

Aboriginal trackers were brought in for 
the search which involved some 200 volunteers and rescue workers. The 
trackers found the imprint of his running shoe before a helicopter crew 
saw him at 5am yesterday almost 13 miles from the ranch.

Doing everything they can: Sam with his mother and sister in front of the Empire State Building in New York. The family have paid for an extra helicopter with night vision equipment to be drafted in to join the search

‘He’s moving – he’s alive,’ the crew 
reported back to their command centre. A Queensland police spokesman 
said Sam was taken to the 135,000 acre Upshot Station cattle ranch where
he had been staying.

According to his mother, Sam managed a smile when he was found by a rescue team which included his cousin Rob.

She says she believes that her son 
will want to continue his travels which was set to include a trip to 
Thailand and trekking in the Himalayas but said 'I don’t know if the 
rest of the family will be able to stand that.

'No doubt it’s what Sam will want to carry on doing but it might write the rest of us off.'

He then endured crippling heat of around 39C for the next three days. At night he simply curled up on the ground before resuming his efforts to find his way home.

Keen sportsman: Sam Woodhead wants to join the Marines

Alex Dorr, a pilot with the North 
Queensland Rescue Helicopter, described the area Sam became lost in as 
‘harsh and unforgiving’. He added: ‘Not that long ago we had a guy who 
was missing for a much shorter time and he passed away.’

Family support: Sam's father Peter described the family's ordeal as a nightmare when he appeared on ITV

His
father Peter and sister Rebecca told ITV's Daybreak about the family's 
'nightmare' ordeal waiting for news about the lost teen.

Rebecca
said the former Brighton College student was on his way to hospital by 
helicopter with injuries no worse than ‘minor sunstroke, dehydration and
chapped lips’.

Asked about 
being reunited with Sam, she joked 'God, I'm going to give a bloody good
whack, I tell you. There's a queue - trust me!'

'The word 'nightmare' these days is much misused,’ he said. ‘This has been a true nightmare.’

He went on to thank all the people who helped find Samuel - who numbered up to 200.

After hearing the news, Mr Woodhead's sister Emma Lupton told BBC Radio Five Live today: 'We're just so relieved that he is safe. I just want to give him a hug.'

'It has just been the worst few days really and we've just had to stay positive and keep positive thoughts in our heads.'

Helicopters and scores of local people in four wheel drive vehicles had been scouring the area around the cattle station where Mr Woodhead had been staying for the previous 10 days as part of his ‘outback experience' during his gap year.

A middle-aged Swiss couple who were lost in Western Australia last month managed to survive three days in the desert because they had access to river water.

A man on a quad bike who went missing earlier this week in Western Australia was found in a dehydrated state after two days.
