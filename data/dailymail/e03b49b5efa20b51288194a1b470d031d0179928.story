The Army has more top brass than battle tanks, alarming statistics have revealed.

There are 256 brigadiers and generals but just 200 Challenger II tanks, according to the figures uncovered by a former senior military intelligence officer.

It also emerged there are three times more senior officers than Apache attack helicopters, which play a vital role in Afghanistan.

Alarming: New figures have found there are more than 250 brigadiers and generals in the British Army but there are just 200 active Challenger tanks

The disturbing imbalances were discovered by Frank Ledwidge, who served on the frontline in Iraq, Bosnia and Kosovo.

‘Our priorities are hugely skewed,’ he said. ‘The British Army is over-burdened and over-staffed with senior ranks.

‘We need to think about cutting top brass and the focus now should be on our conflicts rather than promotion.’

He believes retaining so many 
one-star generals and above earning £100,000-a-year plus while cutting 
spending is devastating morale in the Armed Forces.

One tank officer said: ‘When the MoD 
is making large cuts to  equipment and personnel, the troops are rightly
 going to question why we need to retain so many well-paid senior 
officers living a good life.’

The Royal Navy is suffering a similar plight with more admirals than active warships, according to an 2008 study.

Following the recent defence cuts, the senior service now has just 20 fighting surface ships, which are destroyers and frigates.

Mr Ledwidge’s figures were gleaned 
from official statistics and published in his new book Losing Small 
Wars: British Military Failure in Iraq and Afghanistan.

He claims only around 200 of the UK’s force of 350 Challenger II main battle tanks are in service, with the others in storage.

It was reported this year that the 
number of tanks in operation could fall as low as 50 as the Ministry of 
Defence looks to make £4.7billion of budget cuts. It also needs to 
eliminate a £38billion deficit in the equipment programme.

At a peak during World War Two, 
Britain produced more than 30,000 tanks. The Challenger II main battle 
tank is considered the most  complex vehicle in the nation’s arsenal.

The Royal Tank Regiment – the world’s
 oldest tank unit – has been at the forefront of armoured warfare since 
the vehicles were used to smash through First World War German trenches 
in 1917.

Challenger IIs were used in Iraq in 2003 but the difficult terrain of Afghanistan means they have not been deployed there.

Instead, the regiment has transferred
 its skills to a new range of more manoeuvrable armoured vehicles, 
including Mastiffs and Warthogs, in the fight against the Taliban.

The Army currently has more than 3,000 armoured vehicles.

The MoD believes the Army can cope 
with fewer tanks as traditional heavy warfare will be replaced by more 
counter-insurgency campaigns, such as in Afghanistan.

Last night the MoD said the number of senior officers had dropped slightly from the figures obtained this year by Mr Ledwidge.

A spokesman said: ‘As we restructure 
for the future, we are reducing the number of senior officers, which 
currently stands at about 230.

‘Modern armies require more than just tanks. Operations require a range of armoured vehicles.’

Under the spending cuts, the Armed 
Forces will lose at least 22,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen within 
four years, more than ten per cent of their number.

The Navy was ordered to axe HMS Ark Royal and retire the fleet of Harrier jump jets.

The RAF was forced to send its new Nimrod MRA4 maritime  surveillance aircraft to the wreckers’ yard.
