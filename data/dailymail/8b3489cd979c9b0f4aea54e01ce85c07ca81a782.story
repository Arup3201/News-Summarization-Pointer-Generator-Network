I am a glass half-full person and 11 months out from the final stages of the World Cup there was a lot to like in that England performance. They will be disappointed not to have won, they had given themselves every chance at half time but ultimately the reality check of playing such a canny New Zealand side will pay dividends.

New Zealand were not that impressive in the first half but responded, as you always knew they would, and played the conditions much better in the second half.

In the end they outscored England three tries to one and that is a statistic we need to note yet again, because they didn’t actually create that many opportunities. Being New Zealand, though, they took them — their third try was clincal and particularly well executed.

England need to start taking the chances they make and start scoring three or four tries on a regular basis against the best sides. That is the ratio you need to win big matches these days.

But let’s concentrate on the positives first.

Over five months on from their last game, England could and maybe should have beaten the world champions, who are battle-hardened and in the groove after their Rugby Championship campaign and a warm-up match against USA last week.

New Zealand have played eight Test matches since England last took the field in anger and that was a big factor.

England’s pack were immense in all respects. The front five — minus Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes when he went off injured — dominated the line-out and scrum and that is so important, going forward.

In the pack England can compete against any team in the world and they have the strength in depth to ensure such power up-front every time they take the field. That is a great position to be in.

Despite the defeat, England captain Chris Robshaw was immense and deserved to win man of the match 

Chris Robshaw was outstanding for England for the whole 80 minutes and although it seems mandatory to give the man-of-the-match award to somebody from the winning team, I would have opted for the England skipper and not Richie McCaw.

He outplayed the New Zealand skipper, not for the first time, in the first half and kept going strongly after the break when England found the going much tougher and McCaw, like all great players, raised his game.

Robshaw is the first name on the England teamsheet for me but I still maintain he might be better suited to playing at six — not least because he is England’s best attacking forward, the most comfortable on the ball and with the best hands.

At six, when you are not arriving at the contact area first all the time, you often get more opportunity to make go-forward yards as Jerome Kaino does for New Zealand.

I am on record as saying my ideal back row at present would be Robshaw at blindside, Steffon Armitage at seven and James Haskell at eight but clearly that isn’t going to happen with the RFU decison to make Armitage ineligible.

Now is probably not the time for change, anyway.

The pack did very well and should be retained en bloc against a South Africa side that showed in the recent Rugby Championship they are possibly not the scrummaging force they once were, although their line-out is still top drawer. Next week will be brutal up front but this England pack are tough enough for the challenge.

In the backs Kyle Eastmond had a fine first half at centre.

I will admit to being concerned that perhaps he wouldn’t be able to match up physically with Sonny Bill Williams but he did well and the apparent mismatch in size wasn’t an issue.

That cracking pass of his — left to right — should certainly have resulted in a try for Mike Brown during England’s purple patch in the first half. That would have been a peach of a score and would have helped build momentum for England.

So far so good, but now let’s consider the things England need to work on. In the second half, with the weather closing in, against the wind and with New Zealand turning up the pressure, England got bogged down in their own half and suffered from not having a second or third kicking option to clear their lines. They simply could not get out of their own half.

Brown, with his big left boot, did not seem to be offering himself and it was at this stage that Eastmond’s lack of a kicking game came to light. Ideally, I always prefer a ten and 12 who have a kicking and passing game and that third quarter — and indeed the rest of the game — emphasised that.

New Zealand's Israel Dragg won possession and launched counter attacks all too frequently

Danny Care’s box kick was seen as an alternative but it was relied on too heavily and became predictable for Israel Dagg and Julian Savea. Too often they were grateful recipients of the ball and used the possession to launch another New Zealand attack.

The big games comes at you thick and fast during these Autumn internationals and you have to embrace that. Stuart Lancaster and his management team — Graham Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt — earned a massive vote of confidence from the RFU recently with those six-year contracts through to 2020. It is in phases of the season like the next three weeks where they must all really earn their corn. Next up come South Africa — a side who beat New Zealand not so very long ago.

That England coaching team need to really analyse exactly what went on at Twickenham and learn from it.

My gut feeling is that continuity of selection is what is needed now and certainly my experience from my years in charge in these Autumn campaigns is not to overreact.

Saturday saw a pretty good all-round performance and nobody produced an individual display which warrants dropping them.

What I do think though is that with the power England showed in the tight, they should perhaps concentrate on playing a tighter game — a bit more like Saracens, if you like.

If you are not going to pick a 12 who possesses world-class kicking options you probably need to play to your strength up front more.

A busy week lies ahead but I remain optimistic.
