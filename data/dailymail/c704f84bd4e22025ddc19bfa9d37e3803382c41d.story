Police are to re-consider launching a criminal investigation into the the payday lender Wonga, it has been revealed.

City of London Police will look again at whether the company should face a probe after it sent fake legal letters to pressure customers into paying up.

The case was discussed a year ago but it was previously decided that it should be left to regulators so the 45,000 consumers affected would not be delayed in receiving their compensation.

But the force says that now that the Financial Conduct Authority’s investigations have concluded and a compensation agreement has been reached, it will 'be reassessing whether a criminal investigation is now appropriate'.

Earlier this week, Wonga said it had agreed with the regulator to pay £2.6million in compensation for the letters it sent from non-existent law firms.

City of London Police said in a statement: 'In March 2013 the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) met with the City of London Police to consider their (OFT’s) investigation into Wonga and whether it should be referred to the National Policing Lead for Fraud.

'The interests of the consumer were at the forefront of these discussions and directed the decision that the most appropriate course of action was for the OFT to continue to investigate as regulator focusing on but not limited to the consumer credit act, legal services act, and unfair trading regulations.

'Now that the regulator’s investigation has concluded and a compensation agreement has been reached with Wonga, the City of London Police will be reassessing whether a criminal investigation is now appropriate.'

The Law Society has already stepped up pressure for a criminal investigation to be held into Wonga.

The society, which represents around 160,000 solicitors across England and Wales, said it has asked the Metropolitan Police to investigate Wonga and consider whether any offences, such as blackmail or those under the Solicitors Act, have been committed.

It has also called on City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to hand over copies of its investigation.

The FCA confirmed it had been contacted by the society but declined to comment further.

Law Society chief executive Desmond Hudson said: 'It seems that the intention behind Wonga’s dishonest activity was to make customers believe that their outstanding debt had been passed to a genuine law firm.

'It looks like they also wanted customers to believe that court action undertaken by a genuine law firm would follow if the debt was not repaid.'

A spokesman for Wonga said earlier today that its focus is on compensating customers who received the 'unacceptable' debt collection letters.
