Overwhelmed parents no longer need to feel guilty for desperately wanting a moment of peace and quiet. They're not alone. 

Mothers and fathers are sharing hilarious photos of their parenting blunders and apologizing to their babies on a 'shame-free' website started by a New Jersey mom who found herself laughing about the everyday realities associated with raising a child.

Humor writer Sarah Showfety, who has a 22-month-old daughter and another child on the way, came up with the idea for Dear Baby XO after the birth of her baby girl.

'She was a tough baby,' she told ABC News. 'And one time when she was nursing I had this thought that I wished she would hurry up and finish so I could have a glass of wine.'  

The thought made her laugh and immediately want to apologize to her baby. 

It was after that moment that Ms Showfety started keeping a running list of all the inappropriate parenting thoughts that ran through her head on any given day.

It occurred to that she wasn't alone in her thinking, and her desire to brighten another parent's day led to the creation of Dear Baby XO. 

'I thought, if I'm thinking these un-PC things, other moms must be thinking them too,' she wrote in an essay for Huff Post Parents last week. And I bet they could use a laugh.'

Ms Showfety started posting the funny 'Dear Baby' photos on Facebook before she created her website. She also shares pictures and apologies on her site's Instagram and Twitter accounts.

Dear Baby XO is described as a 'place to confess parenting crimes', none of which are actually criminal.

For example, one of the photos found on the site shows an adorable toddler holding a copy of EL James's steamy erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey. 

'Dear Baby: Sorry I Used my last $2 to buy this at a yard sale instead of the headless Barbie you wanted,' reads the picture's caption.   

Another picture features a child rummaging through a kitchen cabinet with the caption: 'Dear Baby: Sorry I made your forage for your dinner.' 

Ms Showfety, who has been posting on Dear Baby XO almost every day for a year, said she has received plenty of positive feedback. 

'I don't write about anything political or really even meaningful,' she said. 'It's not meant to be serious, it's just to get a laugh out of the silly things [parents] do.' 

She added: 'One time a mom thanked me and said "I really needed this today." That made me tear up.'
