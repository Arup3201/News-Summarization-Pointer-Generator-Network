This amazing photograph shows the moment a daring diver got up close and personal to a giant sperm whale - to take a selfie.

Freediver Amanda Cotton, 31, captured the unusual shot while swimming with the large mammals in Dominica, in the Caribbean.

The endangered sperm whale can grow to 60ft (18 metres) in length and can weigh up to 40 tonnes.

The Floridian freediver captured the unusual shot while with the large mammals in Dominica, in the Caribbean earlier this month

The Floridian runs underwater photo tours to educate people on marine life and conservation.

And when she got to within a close distance of one of the whales earlier this month, Ms Cotton couldn’t resist posing with the animal.

‘It is an incredibly humbling experience to be in the water with such a large animal, but these whales pose no threat to the divers,’ she said.

‘In fact they were quite curious at times of the divers, gently moving in closer to a better look at us.’

Ms Cotton admitted that it took several minutes for her to pluck up the courage but, realising the whale felt ‘quite comfortable’, she said ‘it seemed like the perfect opportunity to shoot a once in a lifetime selfie’.

She said: ‘I just couldn’t resist.’

Speaking of her love from being in the ocean and seeing ‘amazing creatures’ like the sperm whale, Ms Cotton said: ‘By sharing the beauty of the ocean through imagery it is the hope of the photographers on this expedition to raise awareness of the need for protection and conservation of our marine animals and their habitats.’
