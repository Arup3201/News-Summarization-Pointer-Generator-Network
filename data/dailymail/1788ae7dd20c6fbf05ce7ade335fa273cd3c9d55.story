Lincoln City savoured the sweet taste of victory over Barnet on Saturday - after  boss Gary Simpson had to use jelly babies to show his team their formation before the match.

The Imps' trip south was nearly scuppered when their team coach failed to show up, meaning players and staff had to make their own way to the ground.

The tactics board didn't make the cut, which led to Simpson marking out a 4-2-4 formation using the sweets on top of a kit locker.

Improvisation: Striker Ben Tomlinson posted the picture of the makeshift tactics board on Twitter

Striker Ben Tomlinson took a photo behind the manager's shoulder and tweeted 'Funny tactics'. 

Those tactics certainly gave Barnet plenty to chew on as Lincoln emerged 2-1 winners.

After the match Simpson told BBC Radio Lincolnshire: 'If we can keep winning I will do whatever is necessary.'

The club are looking into the reason why the team coach did not turn up for the Conference clash.

'We turned up in drips and drabs a little bit, but we all got down,' said Simpson.

'It wasn't the best situation to be in, especially when you are going to the league leaders that haven't conceded a goal, and had got off to an absolutely unbelievable start.'
