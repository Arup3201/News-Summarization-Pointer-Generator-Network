Guilty: Giedrius Zinkevicius battered his friend, who objected to be told he had bad body odour, to death

A man was battered to death by his friend after he objected to being told he had bad body odour.

Labourer Giedrius Zinkevicius, 38, attacked 41 year-old Egidijus Cepulionis after the victim became incensed when told he should take a shower.

Zinkevicius inflicted at least 54 different injuries in the frenzied attack and is facing life in prison.

The Old Bailey heard how he punched and kicked the victim, stamping on his head as he lay on the ground.  

He attacked the fellow Lithuanian in the hallway of his flat in Hackney, East London, after a night downing vodka with his girlfriend, Kristina.

When Kristina told Mr Cepulionis he smelled and suggested he take a shower, a furious row erupted, the Old Bailey heard. 

Zinkevicius showed no emotion in the dock as a jury of eight women and four men unanimously found him guilty of murder.

Judge Wendy Joseph QC adjourned sentencing until next Friday.

She told him: ‘It is proscribed by law that the sentence is life imprisonment.’

Zinkevicius was convicted in February 2011 for affray after stamping on a homeless man at the Whitechapel Mission.

He also admitted assault in July the same year for an attack - with Mr Cepulionis - on two men while out together in Central London.

The court heard Zinkevicius moved to the UK to find a job but ended up living on the streets in 2008 because of his drink problem.

He tried to cut down his boozing after moving in with Kristina in September last year, finding work alongside Mr Cepulionis on a construction site.

However, after a heavy drinking session on January 18 this year, Zinkevicius attacked his friend and beat him to death.

He claimed after the shower jibe he had stepped in to defend his girlfriend who Mr Cepulionis was shaking ‘like a teddy bear’.

Zinkevicius also claimed that the fight started when Mr Cepulionis punched him in the head.

But the jury rejected his denials, hearing blood splatters in the hallway proved Mr Cepulionis was lying on the ground when he was hit.

Zinkevicius, of Pembury Close, Hackney, East London, denied murder.

He was remanded in custody until sentencing on Friday, October 11.
