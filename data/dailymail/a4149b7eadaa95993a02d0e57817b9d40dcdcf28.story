Three students who featured prominently in a now under-question Rolling Stone article about rape at the University of Virginia, have revealed their identities to refute their cold portrayal in the sickening story.

The article sent shockwaves through the university community, after the magazine published a female student's account of being gang-raped by seven men at a UVA fraternity two years ago, leading to the temporary shut down of all Greek life at the Charlottesville campus. 

Next to victim 'Jackie's' account of the horrifying assault, one of the most appalling aspects of the story are the apathetic reactions of her three friends 'Randall', 'Andy' and 'Cindy' who she called for help after escaping the frat that night in September 2012.

The trio are now coming forward to refute key aspects of the Rolling Stone article, saying that while they believe Jackie was the victim of a 'traumatic' sexual assault they have found several inaccuracies in the article and are skeptical of the story.

Furthermore, the students say they never discouraged her from reporting the assault, and that they only stopped insisting she contact police when she asked to be taken back to her dorm room. 

Misrepresented? These are the three friends who ran to alleged rape victim Jackie's aid, the night she told Rolling Stone she was gang raped by seven men at University of Virginia's Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house. Identified as Cindy, Andy and Randall in the article, they say their real names are Kathryn Hendley (left), Alex Stock (center) and Ryan (asked for his last name to be withheld, right)

'The text was so divergent from what we said that evening,' Alex Stock, who was identified as 'Andy in the article, told ABC News on Thursday. 

In the article Jackie describes meeting a junior boy identified as 'Drew' her first few weeks at UVA, and how the fellow lifeguard asked her out to dinner and a date night function at the Phi Kappa Psi House. 

Back at the house, she says she was lured to an upstairs bedroom, where she was thrown through a glass table and then raped one by one by seven men in what appeared to be an initiation ritual. 

When she came to in the early hours of the next morning, Jackie says she fled the house barefoot and then called Randall, Andy and Cindy for help. 

She says the trio tracked her down to find her bloody and in shock, but described how they were hesitant to report the crime, fearing how it would impact their social lives, the boys' intentions to rush a fraternity and Jackie's college reputation. 

That's not how the three friends remember the incident.  

Victim: Jackie (pictured) told Rolling Stone she was violently assaulted by seven men in a fraternity house two weeks into her first year at UVA

The friend identified as 'Randall' in the story, says he was the only one Jackie called that night, contrary to the description of all three responding in unison. He says his real name is Ryan, but asked ABC to withhold his last name. 

Ryan says he found Jackie outside her dorm 'crying and shaking' and that she told him she was forced to perform oral sex on five men in the frat while a sixth watched. 

He says he then called Stock, but that Jackie asked the student identified as 'Cindy' not to come. That student has revealed her name to by Kathryn Hendley, and says she came along with Alex anyway, but stood back from the group while Jackie told her story to the two boys.

Kathryn directly refutes a line in the article, which quotes her as saying 'She's gonna be the girl who cried "rape" and we'll never be allowed into a frat party again.' 

She says she only heard details of the rape later, first from Stock, then from Jackie herself. 

Horrified by the story, the friends say they urged Jackie to report the incident to police, but that she declined and asked to go back to her dorm where two of them spent the night comforting her.

'I mean obviously we were very concerned for her,' Stock told the Washington Post. 'We tried to be as supportive as we could be.'

The friends also added that Jackie did not appear to be injured, despite her account that she was bleeding significantly from being thrown through a glass table.

Further, they also had doubts about her attacker. 

Wrong: Jackie identified Phi Kappa Psi -known as Phi Psi for short - as the frat house where the attack took place but told the Washington Post she only did so because a friend pointed to it a year later and told her: 'That's where it happened.' Her father said she had got the detail wrong

This past week, Jackie finally named the lifeguard who took her back to the frat to her new friends, but when a reporter gave Randall, Cindy and Andy that name, they said they had never heard of it before. 

University of Virginia officials also found the name suspect, saying that no one with that name has ever attended the school. The Post interviewed a man with a similar name, and he admitted to working at the pool with her, he says he never met her in person and was not a member of Phi Psi.

The fraternity released a separate statement saying no Phi Psi brother was working at the aquatic center at that time and that they didn't hold an official social event on the weekend in question. 

At the time, Jackie's friends were under the impression that her date was a junior she met through her chemistry class that year.

Jackie started talking about this mystery man when Randall rebuffed her romantic advances, wanting to stay friends. 

When she revealed that an older student in her chemistry class had been asking her out on dates,  the three friends say they took his number from her phone out of curiosity and started texting the stranger.

The person they talked to wrote about 'this super smart hot' freshman and how they both shared of a love of the band Coheed and Cambria, according to the two-year-old messages shown to the Post.

'I really like this girl,' the guy said in one message. He also sent pictures of himself, showing he had a distinct jawline and blue eyes. 

But the messages also hinted at Jackie's crush on Randall, since the student wrote that she was interested in someone else and refused to date her. 

'Get this she said she likes some other 1st year guy who dosnt (sp) like her and turned her down but she wont date me cause she likes him. She cant turn my down fro some nerd 1st yr. she said this kid is smart and funny and worth it,' the older student wrote.

Eventually, Jackie told her friends that she succumbed and accepted a date from the older student for Friday, September 28, 2012.

Adding even more mystery to the already confusing story, the Post identified the man in the text messages from his pictures, and it turns out he went to high school with Jackie in northern Virginia. 

However, that man, now a junior at a school in a different state, says he  'never really spoke with her', did not attend UVA, was not a member of any fraternity and hadn't been to Charlottesville in at least six years. 

On the specific weekend when Jackie  said she was raped, he was at an athletic event in a different state, and the pictures of him that were messaged to Jackie's friends appear to have been pulled from his social media accounts.

Jackie's friends also had a hard time finding her crush on social media, adding that they never met him in person and now fear they had never been messaging with him in the first place. 

While they are skeptical of details of the night described in the Rolling Stone article, they all agree that something happened to leave Jackie terrified. 

'She had very clearly just experienced a horrific trauma,' Randall said.

'I had never seen anybody acting like she was on that night before and I really hope I never have to again. ... If she was acting on the night of Sept. 28, 2012, then she deserves an Oscar.

Both Randall and Andy say they've been interviewed by the Charlottesville Police, who were asked by the university to start an investigation into the alleged incident. 

Rolling Stone has issued an apology for the story, initially saying their trust in Jackie was 'misplaced'. 

They have stopped commenting on the article, while conducting an internal review. 

On Wednesday, the lawyer representing Jackie asked reporters to stop contacting her and her family. 

 'As I am sure you all can understand, all of this has been very stressful, overwhelming and retraumatizing for Jackie and her family,' Jackie's lawyer Palma Pustilnik said.
