Hull City manager Steve Bruce admits Jermain Defoe is on his January wishlist. 

The former Tottenham Hotspur striker is understood to be open to a Barclays Premier League return from Major League Soccer's Toronto FC.

But the 32-year-old's £68,000-per-week salary, which can potentially rise to £90,000 in his four-year deal with the MLS outfit, may pose a problem for Hull.

Hull City manager Steve Bruce admits Defoe is very much on his January transfer window wishlist

'If he becomes available, which I believe he is, then we'd love to do something,' Bruce said after Hull's 2-0 win over Everton on New Year's Day. 

'I think it might be too expensive but it's not a bad bit of speculation.

'There's always speculation. You ask any club in the bottom of the division about Defoe, all of us would say yes. Whether we can do it financially is another problem.'

Defoe moved to Toronto for £6million from Tottenham last January, and the England striker with 55 caps has also been linked with Queens Park Rangers. 

Hull put 2014 behind them in spectacular fashion by beating a miserable Everton in a manner not properly reflected by the 2-0 scoreline. 

'It's been probably our best performance,' Bruce said. 'We've seen glimpses of it but from the first minute to the 90th there was a determination that it was going to be our day.

'It was the most convincing. We deserved to win the game by a country mile.'
