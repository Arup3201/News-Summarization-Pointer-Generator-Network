Blackpool have accepted a £30,000 fine, half of which is suspended, after the club were found guilty of fielding an ineligible player in their Sky Bet Championship clash with Millwall earlier this season.

Donervon Daniels joined the Seasiders on August 1 on a 28-day youth loan from West Brom, but was not correctly registered at the time of the August 30 fixture in question.

The 20-year-old defender, who has now made 17 appearances for the club, played the full 90 minutes of the 2-1 loss to the Lions at The Den.

Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston said in a brief statement on the club website: 'The process and outcome is one that we feel is fair. We'd now like to draw a line under this matter and focus on the rest of the season.'

An independent football disciplinary commission ruled on the punishment and also ordered Blackpool to pay the costs of the hearing and those of the Football League.
