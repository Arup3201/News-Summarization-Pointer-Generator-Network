American Airlines has refunded a family's ticket for their daughter who died after a public outcry following their initial refusal to do so.

Madison 'Scout' Cantrell, 9, died tragically from an asthma attack that led to cardiac arrest five months ago, sending her family into deep and sudden grief.

The Cantrells,from St Charles, a suburb of Chicago, had been planning a trip to Bald Head, North Carolina this month, but decided to call it off.

Scout's sister Katie, 13, said going to their traditional family vacation spot would be too emotionally painful.

American Airlines refused to offer a refund for Scout's seat, transfer the ticket to someone else or issue a voucher.

Felicity Cantrell, Scout's mother, applied for a refund and sent in a death certificate but was told that the documents did not 'meet exception requirements'

The airline's website says that a travel vouches are given to family members of passengers who die before their flight. 

Felicity Cantrell, Scout's mother, said on Facebook that she had sent in the required documentation and death certificate, but posted a letter  from the company denying her request for a refund.

The callous letter said 'the request does not meet our exception requirements' and that the fee for changing the flight would be waived 'as a one-time courtesy.'

'I know that I would never write this to someone. I don't know how someone could send this to another family,' Katie Cantrell told NBC Chicago.

Senior management from American Airlines got in contact with Felicity Cantrell on Wednesday night, and the family finally got their refund after a 'genuine' conversation

Social media users shared the mother's tragedy and American Airlines' corporate team got in touch with her, saying that she had gotten a refund when they actually hadn't.

The customer service representatives that first contacted the family 'further exacerbated how American has treated us,' Mrs Cantrell said.

On Wednesday night senior management from the company called and gave the Cantrells their refund.

'Were they doing corporate damage control? Yes, absolutely' Mrs Cantrell said. 

However, she added that her conversation with the manager was genuine and that he was 'thoroughly embarrassed and horrified by this whole situation'.

The American Airlines representative also said that changes would be made in corporate training so  that employees will 'reflect empathy'.

Mrs Cantrell posted on Facebook that the family would be vacationing in South Carolina this year. 

Social media users became outraged after hearing about the airline's callous response to the Cantrells. Pictured, Tony Cantrell and his daughters Scout (left) and Katie (right)
