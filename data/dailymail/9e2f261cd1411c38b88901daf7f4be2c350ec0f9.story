A would-be Spiderman had to be pulled to safety after climbing 150ft up the outside a block of flats in order to ‘party’ on the roof.

Wesley Coulding, 36, became stuck for around two hours at the 12th floor of the disused tower block in Hattersley, Greater Manchester after climbing from the ground floor using air conditioning units.

It is thought he had drunk a significant amount of alcohol before scaling the building early on Sunday morning, and he has since been detained under the Mental Health Act.

Rescue: Wesley Coulding was lifted to safety by firefighters after becoming stuck while scaling the outside of a disused tower block in Manchester. His sister said her brother had 'wanted to party on the roof'

Mr Coulding reportedly told fire crews who came to his aid: ‘I was high and wanted to get higher’, adding that he was cold and that at no time had he intended on jumping from the ledge.

His sister Kelly, who lives nearby, told reporters that her brother had scaled the building because ‘he wanted to party on the roof’.

Witnesses looked on in horror, many of them in tears, as Mr Coulding became stuck on a ledge at around the 12th floor of the disused tower Tameside Court tower block on Hattersley Road East at around 9.30am on Sunday morning.

Trapped: Wesley Coulding used air conditioning units on the outside of the building to climb to the 12th floor. He told rescuers he 'was high and wanted to get higher'.

It wasn’t until two hours later that 
firefighters from the local Technical Rescue Unit were able to set up a 
rope system on the roof of the building and pull Mr Coulding to safety.

Mr Coulding was taken to Tameside General Hospital by ambulance for check-ups after being lowered to safety.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police confirmed the incident had taken place but added that no action was being taken against Mr Coulding.
