Radamel Falcao's future at Manchester United was in fresh doubt on Sunday night after Louis van Gaal axed the Colombia star from his squad against Southampton.

The move backfired as United suffered their first defeat at home to Saints in the league for 27 years, and failed to have a single shot on goal at Old Trafford for the first time since May 2009.

Falcao’s omission was a major surprise and will inevitably raise questions over his prospects of persuading United to spend £52million to turn his loan from Monaco into a permanent move at the end of the season.

The former FC Porto and Atletico Madrid striker, who earns £280,000-a-week at Old Trafford, had started the previous five games and scored twice.

But he was left out of the 18-man squad altogether with Van Gaal choosing to name teenage striker James Wilson and no fewer than three centre-backs on the bench. United ended the game with Marouane Fellaini up front alongside Wayne Rooney.

It is understood that the United boss had not explained the reasons for his decision to Falcao, and the player then watched the 1-0 defeat from a private box.

‘Falcao isn’t injured he’s just not selected in the squad,’ said Van Gaal, who admitted beforehand that one of his star forwards would have to miss out now they are all fit.

‘It’s much more difficult selecting a side but that’s the task of the manager and I have a staff who advise me as well.

‘We have now a lot of players who are coming back and he has played the last few matches in a row. Then I have to compare players with each other.

‘Now he is out of the 18 but that is this moment. Next week is another moment.

‘When you see the composition of my bench I don’t have (room) for a second striker.

‘You have to compare players before the match, and after the match you can say you could have won if a player had participated but you shall never know.

‘It is a bad result. When you are dominating the game like we did, you have to create more chances. Southampton came for a draw, I believe, and they go away with a victory and that is disappointing. We gave the goal away.’

Falcao appeared to be settling into English football after regaining full fitness following a serious knee injury and a calf problem.

Southampton boss Ronald Koeman admitted that he expected to see the striker in United’s starting line-up.

‘I was surprised but I don’t know the reason,’ said Koeman. ‘If he is injured, it is normal. Maybe it is a good question to Mr Van Gaal.’

Dusan Tadic’s 69th minute goal ended United’s 11-game unbeaten run in all competitions and saw Southampton move above Van Gaal’s side into third place in the Premier League.

Koeman believes that his team are capable of staying there for the rest of the season to qualify for the Champions League.

‘If we keep the spirit and the organisation, we can keep in front in the table,’ he said.

‘We got a point against Chelsea and the three points against Arsenal. That makes belief in the players. That is what you need if you are not a big club, not to be afraid of the name or the stadium. We learned that. I am not surprised we won today. We have organisation. We have 11 clean sheets in 21 games.

‘They (United) didn’t create much. The second half was more comfortable. They put Fellaini up front, played the long balls and it was difficult. But we defended well and the spirit was unbelievable.’

Koeman was unhappy with Tadic after he was booked for taking off his shirt in celebration when he scored just six minutes after coming off the bench.

The Serbian’s introduction was delayed because his No.11 jersey was back in the dressing-room and he had also lost his shin pads.

‘It is a yellow card and a stupid fault,’ said Koeman. ‘Your second and it is a red. When it is the last minute of the season and you have qualified for Europe, it is not problem. But I don’t like that. Keep your shirt on.’

Tadic defended his actions, saying: ‘When you score a goal you don’t think about celebrating. You do what you feel in the moment. I don't know why I took my top off, I never do that. But there is always a first time.

‘In the first half I put the shirt and shin pads there and then in the second half I wanted to come on and they were not there. I don’t know what happened.’

United skipper Wayne Rooney insisted that they only had themselves to blame after suffering a first defeat since the Manchester derby in early November.

‘I think we deserved to win the game today,’ said Rooney. ‘Overall we had the better chances, played the better football and deserved to win but we’ve been punished for not taking our chances.

‘I’ve seen Southampton play better, to be honest. We stopped a lot of their threats but we got punished with the goal they scored.

‘We’re not fussed how big or small a day it is for Southampton, we’re focussed on us and we have to move on.’
