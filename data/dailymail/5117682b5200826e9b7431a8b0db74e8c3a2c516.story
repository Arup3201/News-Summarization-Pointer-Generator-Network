A grandmother endured six gruelling months of chemotherapy after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer, only to discover she never had the disease.

Ann Milne chose to have the treatment to prolong her life in 2008 after doctors told her they had found tumours on her liver.

For six months she faced the arduous treatment, which she said caused her hair loss, vomiting and fatigue.

In 2009 she went back to hospital where doctors shared the good news, Mrs Milne was free of cancer.

But the 56-year-old's elation was quickly followed by despair as the specialists revealed she had never been suffering cancer in the first place.

After treatment appeared to make no difference, doctors called her back to hospital in 2009. They revealed the good news that Mrs Milne, pictured with her children Lynne, Douglas and Neil and grandchildren Skye and Nikole, was cancer free. But her elation turned to anger when they revealed she never had terminal cancer

Today, six years on, the mother-of-four, who was left with permanent muscle damage and needing a stick to walk long distances, has been awarded compensation.

She said: 'It has ruined my life, I used to be so full of energy and loved going for long walks with my family, but now I struggle to walk a few metres without getting tired.

'The whole ordeal has aged me by 20 years. I am disgusted I went through chemotherapy for a disease I didn't even have, it could have killed me.

'The strain that this has put on my family is huge, I don't think we will ever be able to get over this, I was effectively given a death sentence.' 

The former receptionist from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, was devastated when she was told she had liver cancer, five years after beating breast cancer.

In 2003, she found a cancerous lump on her breast, and had a mastectomy and chemotherapy before the cancer went into remission. 

When she experienced pain in her right arm in November 2008 she went to see her GP.

Tests showed a number of lesions on her liver, which doctors misdiagnosed as cancerous tumours.

Devastated Mrs Milne, and her husband, Graeme, 50, a crane operator, were told there was nothing doctors could do to stop the cancer killing her.

But she was given the option of chemotherapy to give her more time to spend with her children, Lynne, 36, Douglas, 31, Neil, 29 and Paul 28 and her granddaughters Skye, 17, Nikole, 14, Lily and Sienna, both one.

For the next six months Mrs Milne endured six sessions of chemotherapy, which caused her to lose her hair, left her vomiting and suffering fatigue.  

Her face drooped so much that her children thought she had suffered a stroke.

Chemotherapy is an aggressive treatment for cancer.

Drugs are used to kill cancer cells, damaging the cells to prevent them reproducing and spreading.

While the treatment is very effective it does cause side-effects.

The medications used cannot differentiate between fast-growing cancer cells and other types of fast-growing cells, including blood cells, skin cells and the cells inside the stomach.

It means most chemotherapy medications have a poisonous effect on the body's cells, causing problems, including:

Mrs Milne  even created a memory book to help her children remember her and began to make plans for her funeral.

She said she first realised something was wrong with her health when she suffered shooting pains in her arm.

'I just thought it was joint pain so I booked an appointment with my GP.

'I was referred for a scan and three weeks later I was called in where my doctor told me that the cancer had returned on my liver. 

'His words hit me like a ton of bricks. The next few minutes were a blur and I felt like I was in my own little bubble.

'The realisation hit me and I started to wonder if I'd get to see my grandchildren grow up and get married. 

'I asked the doctor how long I had. He wouldn't answer but I could tell he didn't think I had long,' she said.

Although Mrs Milne remembered the horrors of chemotherapy from her previous treatments, she agreed to it for the sake of  precious time with her children and grandchildren.

Within a month she began treatment but, after her first session, she was rushed to intensive care when her heart struggled to cope.

'My doctor suggested my body couldn't cope with the strong chemo but I was determined to keep going and had another five sessions every three or four weeks,' she said.

The unnecessary treatment has ruined her life, she said. Before being given the 'all clear', she was in the process of creating a memory book for her children (pictureand planning her funeral

The treatment left her confined to her bed for months with no energy to play with her grandchildren. 

Her hair also fell out in clumps, her muscles wasted away, she developed flu-like symptoms and loss of appetite. 

Then, in 2009, after doctors noticed that Mrs Milne's condition was unchanged following the chemotherapy, she was called in to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for a check-up.

Mrs Milne said: 'I thought they were going to tell me that I was responding well to treatment. I started to wonder if I'd somehow beaten cancer again, despite the diagnosis. 

'When the doctor told me that I was clear of cancer, I felt so happy. 

But her elation was cut short when she was then told she'd never had cancer in the first place.

'She said the "tumours" they had found were just harmless lesions and not cancerous.

'My happiness was soon replaced with anger.'

Mrs Milne's family were overjoyed with the news, but she has been left bitterly upset by her experiences.

'They have robbed me of my life,' she said.

'The pain my family have been put through, they thought I was going to die - we will never be able to get over this.

'The problem is that if I get cancer again there is no way my body could handle a third round of chemotherapy, it was a horrific ordeal and I want to put it all behind me.

'My children were ecstatic when they found out I was ok but at the same time to think your mum is going to die within the year is disgusting.'

Mrs Milne has agreed a six figure out-of-court settlement with NHS Grampian but she says the organisation have failed to apologise. 

An NHS Grampian spokeswoman would only say said: 'We can now confirm this matter has concluded.'
