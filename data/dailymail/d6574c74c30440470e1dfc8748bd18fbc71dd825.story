Ms Pistorius said she was 'dumbfounded' be media reports that suggested her brother had received preferential treatment during her visit to him on Saturday to celebrate his 28th birthday  

Ms Pistorius said her convicted killer brother had received 'nothing that was not allowed' under prison rules

She said she was 'dumbfounded' by stories in local newspapers, and said she and her brother had had a 45-minute non-contact visit with Pistorius.

During which time, she tweeted, 'my brother receiving nothing that was not allowed be prison regulations'. She said no cake or perishables were present during the meeting.

She tweeted: 'In fact, he only received toiletries and letters on his birthday and we took some balloons to show him through the glass divider.'

Ms Pistorius said her family had been 'respectful' of prison regulations and that correctional officers had been 'courteous but stern' when dealing with them. 

Pistorius is one month into a five-year prison sentence for shooting dead his 29-year-old model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at their Pretoria home on Valentine's Day last year.

Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide and two firearms charges in relation to the death of his partner Reeva Steenkamp, pictured, at their Pretoria home on Valentine's Day last year

He was found guilty of culpable homicide and two firearms charges.

Judge Thokozile Masipa cleared the athlete, known as the Blade Runner, of murder after the prosecution was unable to prove he intended to kill Ms Steenkamp.

Throughout trial at the High Court in Pretoria, prosecutor Gerrie Nel vigorously argued that Pistorius had intended to kill his girlfriend.

South Africa's Department of Correctional Services said it would investigate the claims Pistorius had received preferential treatment and the information given to the media, the International Business Times reported.
