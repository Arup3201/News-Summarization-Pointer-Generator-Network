This incredible photograph shows the moment a one-year-old girl who lost her arms and legs to meningitis learns to crawl.

Harmonie-Rose Allen became a quadruple amputee shortly after taking her first ever steps.

Doctors told her parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen their only daughter had one of the worst cases of the virus they had ever seen.

Harmonie was given a one in ten chance of survival and spent her first birthday in intensive care as her limbs were removed in a series of operations.

Doctors were also forced to remove the tip of her nose and warned her parents she could suffer long-term vision and learning problems.

The youngster's plight touched the hearts of thousands of people who have already raised £100,000 to help her cope with life without arms or legs.

Her family say she is facing the challenge with remarkable good nature - as these first photos show.

Last week Harmonie opened the first door of her advent calendar, with the help of her mother, and has even been painting her own Christmas card with the help of a special attachment.

Her mother Miss Hall, 20, said: 'She has such a strong character and it is beginning to come back now - she knows what she wants. She has got her smile back.

'Ross and I are extremely proud of Harmonie. She has come so far and fought so hard to be here with us.

'We will make her life as amazing and fulfilling as we can. She's our perfect little princess and she will always be perfect.

'To be told that she had 10 per cent chance of survival and to be here now is incredible and means so much to us how hard she's fought.

'I don't know what I would do without her.'

She is now beaming again after the killer bug struck 10 days after she walked for the first time in September. Her parents feared she wouldn't survive to enjoy Christmas with them

Despite the ordeal she has faced, the toddler is finally smiling again.

Medics warned her parents she had a 10 per cent chance of surviving when she fell victim to the killer bug in September - just 10 days after taking her first steps.  

Three months on and the family are preparing to spend Christmas in hospital.

Miss Hall, 20, said: 'She has such a strong character and its beginning to come back now, she knows what she wants.

'She has got her smile back. Ross and I are extremely proud of Harmonie. She has come so far and fought so hard to be here with us.

'We will make her life as amazing, and fulfilling as we can. She's our perfect little princess and she will always be perfect.  

'To be told that she had 10 per cent chance of survival and to be here now is incredible and means so much to us how hard she's fought.

'I don't know what I would do without her.'

Harmonie-Rose's parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen first noticed something was wrong when she woke in the night coughing and soon developed a tell-tale rash. Doctors told the couple their daughter had a 10 per cent chance of surviving, preparing them for the worst

Meningitis Research Foundation estimates that there are around 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK and Ireland.

This means that every day nine people become ill with the diseases. With one in ten people dying, a death will occur almost every day.

A further two people will be left with life-altering after effects as severe as brain damage, deafness and multiple amputations.

Meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection, but they are not yet available for all forms.

So it's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia.

Septicaemia can occur with or without meningitis. Not everyone gets all the symptoms and they can appear in any order.

The couple first noticed something was wrong with Harmonie-Rose in September, when she woke in the night coughing and unable to breathe.

They took her to the Royal United Hospital in Bath but doctors could not find anything seriously wrong and she was sent home. 

But the next morning Harmonie-Rose turned blue and they took her back to the same hospital.

Following an assessment they were told it was just a virus and were again sent home.

But hours later Harmonie-Rose became floppy and lethargic and they rushed back to the hospital, where a rash was spotted.

Within four hours, the toddler's body was covered with the purple rash, leaving her parents lost for words.

Miss Hall, a full-time mother, said: 'She had a cold for about a week before we took her to the hospital but she was also teething.

'She was still happy and playing right up until we took her to the hospital the second time.

'We saw the spot on her nose and it did not go away, the nurse acted very fast and within seconds her room was filled with doctors and nurses.

'Every time we looked at Harmonie she was becoming covered with more purple like bruises.

'Harmonie was then taken to adult intensive care and we did not hear from them until about four hours later.

'When we walked in to see Harmonie I could have fainted. 

'She was asleep and was more covered in the rash than before, this was when we realised it was really severe.

'The doctors told us she would lose the tip of her nose and that was only if she survived.

'He told us he was very worried about our little girl and that she may not survive, my whole life was turned upside down within a second I was so angry and upset.

'The rash was literally covering her from head to toe, it was purple and a dark purple.

'Gradually the whole of her arms and legs were purple; they weren't just dots anymore, they had changed the colour of Harmonie's skin.'

The brave toddler, pictured with her mother, fought the bug, but doctors were forced to amputate her arms and legs, as well as the tip of her nose. She has undergone 10 operations but is now out of immediate danger 

Friends and family have helped raise more than £100,000 for the Help4Harmonie appeal to help pay for the one-year-old's future rehabilitation, hydrotherapy and adaptations to her home

Harmonie-Rose has undergone more than 10 operations and is now out of immediate danger, but her mother says she still faces a number of challenges on her road to recovery. 

Since the youngster's diagnosis, friends, family and members of the public have been raising funds to help Harmonie.

To date the Help4Harmonie appeal has raised more than £100,000, which will be used for rehabilitation, hydrotherapy and home adaptations.

Her mother added: 'The support has really helped and it's overwhelming. People from all over the world are supporting Hope4Harmonie.
