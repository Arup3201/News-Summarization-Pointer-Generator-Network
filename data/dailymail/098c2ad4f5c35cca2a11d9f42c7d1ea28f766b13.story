Speaking live via a video link in Australia, Dujardin said: 'Thank you very much. I am really privileged to accept this award. I am sorry I can't be there but I am in Melbourne at present.

'I have an incredible relationship with my horse Valegro. I have been working with him for eight years now. We know each other inside out. He's like my dance partner out there.

'In fact, he should be up on the stage receiving the award, too. But he's at home in the stables!

'I would like to thank all my fans and my whole backroom team. People like Carl Hester and many others who have helped me to get to where I am today. I have had an incredible four years in my sport – what I have achieved is unbelievable.'
