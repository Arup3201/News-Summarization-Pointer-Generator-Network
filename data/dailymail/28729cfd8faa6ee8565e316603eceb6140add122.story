Edward Aronson, 77, pushed his wife Sylvia and broke her hip after the couple had been married 33 years

An old man was up to some tricks new tricks this Saturday when his wife caught him looking at the dating site EHarmony--this led to violence.

Sylvia Aronson, 76, slapped her husband of 33 years Edward Aronson, 77, across the face inside of their home in Lake Worth Florida. Edward then pushed his wife to the ground causing her to break her hip.

Paramedics responded to a 911 call an hour later and took the woman from her house at the 82000 block of Abalone point boulevard to Bethesda Hospital West.

Edward was then booked into the county jail on two felony counts of battering someone of the age of 65, reported The Smoking Gun. He was released a few hours later on $5,000 bail.Â 

It wasn't until Sylvia was admitted into Bethesda Hospital, that others caught wind of the domestic dispute.

Nurse Lori Leison overheard Edward telling someone over the phone, 'she accused me of cheating and was yelling at me so I pushed her.'

The Palm Beach New Times reports that Aronson glared at his wife as he spoke on the phone.

Leison then reported the incident and the Palm Beach County Sheriff's office took over. According to the police report Sylvia, 'became so upset with him not being honest that she slapped him on the left side of his face.'

Aronson's face had minor swelling on the left side. Neither spouse decided to give a formal statement.

According to the Delaware Coalition Against Domestic Violence, abuse of women by their spouses in the 'over 60' group is on the rise in the United States.

It is estimated that more than one in ten women over 50 suffers from physical, sexual, or verbal abuse perpetrated by an intimate partner.
