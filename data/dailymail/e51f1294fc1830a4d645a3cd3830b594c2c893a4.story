Keira Knightley is one of the most stylish women in the world, so it is of little surprise that the British actress was a little underwhelmed with the fashion choices of some of the tech world's biggest names after recently attending a private screening of her new movie in Silicon Valley.

Knightley, who is busy promoting her new film The Imitation Game, was a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday, where she recounted a day spent with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Google entrepreneur Sergey Brin at the home of billionaire investor Yuri Milner.

Her takeaway from the day?

Casual threads: The actress said the group, which included Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (above), seemed to be very fond of hoodies and Crocs

'They had a lot of hoodies. Hoodies are big in the tech industry, I found. Silicon Valley, they love it. And Crocs,' she told Kimmel.

'Sergey, whom I assume is a very rich man, was definitely wearing Crocs.'  

Knightley also took some time at the gathering to ask the men when she could expect to see someone finally make a hoverboard, the levitating boards used as a mode of transport in the films Back to the Future Part II and Back to the Future Part III.

Sadly, it did not go the way Knightley had hoped.

'None of them were into the idea,' she told Kimmel.

Style star: Knightley has long been considered one of the best dressed women in the world, known for her perfect red carpet the looks

One of the men was however interested in seeing Knightley again, and approached her with a line only a tech industry millionaire could pull off. 

'Somebody actually came up to me and said, "Well if you ever want to see a spaceship, here's my card," which has never happened to me before,' said the actress.

'So I may phone him and say, "Yes, show me spaceships."'

Back to the future: Knightley also revealed that she asked the men if they might ever make hoverboards

Awards season: The actress is currently promoting her new film The Imitation Game (above), which is expected to score her and costar Cumberbatch both Oscar nominations

The group was no doubt incredibly eager to see Knightley's new film as it tells the story of Alan Turing, the man who famously broke Nazi codes during World War II and is thought by many to have played the single biggest  role in the Allied victory.

As a result, he has long been considered the father of theoretical computer science. 

He is played by British Lothario Benedict Cumberbatch in the film, while Knightley plays fellow cryptanalyst Joan Clarke.

Both actors, and the film, are expected by many to be nominated for Academy Awards.
