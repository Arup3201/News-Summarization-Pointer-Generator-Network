Daniel Agger has paid for Denmark's homeless football team to attend the Homeless World Cup in Chile later this year.

The former Liverpool defender, who returned to his old club Brondby this summer, paid £2,100 to help fund his nation's trip to South America after being approached by its organiser.

Frits Ahlstrom the Ombold charity told Danish channel TV2: 'I talked to him and said we still had to find 20,000 krone, and he said without hesitating: ‘I’ll give it to you.’

'There is no substitute for class and Daniel has it on and off the field, as a player and as a person.'

The 29-year-old central defender moved to the Danish side for £3million after eight years at Anfield.

Agger has made 232 appearances for the Merseyside club, but has only lifted a single trophy - the 2012 Carling Cup at Wembley.
