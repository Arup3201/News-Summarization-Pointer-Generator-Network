The young woman who spent an entire flight in the cockpit hanging out with the pilots of a Malaysian Airlines plane in 2011 says it was 'scary and eerie' to learn one of the men was flying MH370 when it disappeared.

Jonti Roos, a South African currently living in Melbourne during a year-long stay in Australia, revealed last week she and her friend Jaan Maree were plucked from the queue while waiting to board a flight from Phuket to Kuala Lumpur and asked if they would like to ride up front.

Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, the co-pilot of missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, spent the flight smoking in the cockpit and chatting with the two girls, Ms Roos claims.

Defending her story: Jonti Roos says she only came forward to share the information on the co-pilot and was not seeking fame

As the search for MH370 continues and authorities investigate the possibility that Mr Hamid and Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah were involved in the plane's mysterious disappearance, Ms Roos says she feels like her life was in his hands.

'It’s scary and it's a bit eerie, and I think that it makes me think about it a bit more than anyone else would,' she told Channel Nine's Inside Story on Wednesday.

'It's um...  If the pilots were at fault here then it's scary knowing that my life was in the hands of those pilots.'

Ms Roos has defended her decision to come forward and reveal on A Current Affair last week her controversial encounter with Mr Hamid.

She and Ms Maree, who were teenage backpackers at the time, posed for pictures with the pilots and were invited to extend their trip so they could hang out again.

Jonty Roos has told A Current Affair of her friendship with Fariq Abdul Hamid, the first officer of Flight MH370 when she and her friend Jaan Maree(above) were invited into the cockpit during a flight in 2011.

Mr Hamid's family - hurt by Ms Roos' television appearance - have since contacted the young woman, who has also been accused of showboating during a serious and complex investigation.

'They told me that they felt he'd been painted in a bad light. But that wasn't my attention,' Ms Roos added.

'My heart goes out to them and breaks for them, but it's just what happened in the cockpit.'

'People say that I was doing it (appearing on TV) for attention... they said that the information was completely irrelevant, they said that I should have come forward with this information two years ago when it happened.'

Despite an extensive search that has spanned large expanses of Asia and the Indian Ocean and dozens of unproven theories, the Boeing 777-200 is still missing. Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8.

One question that emerged after Ms Roos came forward last week: 'How was she even allowed near the cockpit?'

It's commonplace, particularly since September 11, for airlines to completely bar access to the cockpit except for essential personnel.

But Ms Roos says it never raised any eyebrows at the time.

'It certainly didn't seem unusual,' she said.

'No-one seems from what I noticed, shocked by it and it did seem like it may have happened before. I do agree that safety measures weren't followed completely at the time I didn't realise.

'I assumed if everyone was so comfortable with us being in there it was something that was done, something that was allowed, but now that I know how strict safety measures are supposed to be.’

Among the latest theories on the disappearance of MH370 is a satellite image that appears to show the plane in the skies above a jungle.

The image (above) is taken from Tomnod, the map search website currently being used by hundreds of thousands of people in an attempt to search for missing passenger plane, and was posted on Reddit on Sunday.

The authenticity of the photo has not been verified; it comes as several Malaysian villages claim to have to seen the plane over the north-east of the country before it's believed to have a made a 'U-turn'.

Similarly, residents of a tiny island in the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives say they saw a plane with Malaysia Airlines markings in the early hours of Saturday March 8.
