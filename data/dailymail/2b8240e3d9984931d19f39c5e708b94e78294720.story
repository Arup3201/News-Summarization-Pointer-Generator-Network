As a pub design, traditionalists might say it's all at sea.

But the developers of the Hall & Woodhouse pub and restaurant in Portishead, Somerset, hope it will make some waves.

For the establishment is made of 28 huge shipping containers.

The £2.4million pub and restaurant, run by Dorset family business Hall & Woodhouse, took ten months to build and opened its doors to customers last month.

The design aims to celebrate the quays' industrial marine heritage.

Transformation: The majority of the containers used to ship imports from China before being modified at Felixstowe Dock

A couple of the containers were used to bring in imports from Japan.

The development in north Somerset is set to create more than 55 jobs.

At the pub's launch party, joint 
managing director of the fifth-generation family brewery Mark Woodhouse 
described it as a 'radical departure' for a business that for more than 
200 years has been a traditional rural English brewer.

He even joked that when the architect first presented plans to the board there was stunned silence.

Hall & Woodhouse, which started brewing in 1777 and now has more than 250 pubs across the South and West.

It’s famous Badger beer was also 
introduced to a new audience with its sponsorship of the beer garden at 
the Hampton Court Flower Show.

David Hoare, retail director at Hall 
& Woodhouse says: 'Constructing this magnificent pub-restaurant is 
the culmination of a plan to build something truly special.

'With this location we have really 
pushed the boundaries to create a destination venue that is completely 
relevant to its setting.'

Cargo catering: The pub cost £2.4million to make and is hoped to create 55 jobs in Portishead

The pub, at Chandlery Square, is one of several new buildings that have opened since the development of the marina began several years ago.

A number of shops have opened at Port Marine, including a new Post Office, with more planned as part of an on-going residential development.

Portishead currently has a population of around 22,000 but this is expected to soar to 30,000 when the development is completed.

Local councillor Reyna Knight, whose ward includes Port Marine, said it was good to see the facilities at the marina coming to fruition.

Mrs Knight said: 'The new pub and restaurant will be a welcome addition to the marina and it is good to see continuing investment in the town.

'The development of the area is taking place over many years and with all these new facilities the place is beginning to really develop as a community.'

The new pub will also house facilities for the use of the 250 berth holders at the marina, including toilets and showers.

Keith Berry, marina manager said: 'The marina has room to expand and it was always part of the original concept that there would be additional facilities at the other end of the marina to cater for berth holders.

'These new facilities are in preparation for this expansion and will help take our plans forward.'
