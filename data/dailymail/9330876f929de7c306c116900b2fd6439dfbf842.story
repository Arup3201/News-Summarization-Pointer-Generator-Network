The top 50 restaurants in the world for 2013 have been named, and Manhattan's own Eleven Madison Park has landed the fifth highest ranking.

Per Se, also of New York, just missed the top 10 and came in at number 11 in Restaurant magazine's 'World's 50 Best' list. The magazine's rankings have only been around for a decade, but they are already the most coveted in the culinary craft.

The U.S. and France were the two countries with the most restaurants on the list, both notching up six places in the top 50. But it was still a poor showing for the U.S. compared to last year, when three U.S. restaurants landed in the top 10.

Taking the top spot overall is a restaurant in Girona, Spain, called El Celler De Can Roca.

It has been on the list for eight years but this is the first year that the restaurant has won the No. 1 ranking.

The
 family-run restaurant in Girona, which has featured caramelized olives served on a bonsai tree on 
its menu, toppled Denmark's 
Noma from its position to claim the title after spending two years as 
runner-up on the list. 

The Roca brothers' avant-garde eatery now heads a top-ten lineup dominated by Spanish cuisine.

Other U.S. restaurants on the list were Alinea (15) of Chicago, Le Bernardin (19) of New York, Daniel (29) of New York and The French Laundry (47) in Yountville, Ca.

The restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, 
famed for snail porridge and mustard ice cream, has spent most of the 
past decade in the top five restaurants in the world.

However, the 2013 World's 50 Best Restaurants list - billed as the Oscars of the dining world- ranked it at 33.

Positions two and three on this year's list were taken by chef Rene Redzepi's Noma, in Copenhagen, which has famously served moss, lichen and bone marrow, and Massimo Bottura's comparatively low-key Osteria Francescana in Modena, northern Italy.

El Celler de Can Roca, run by the three Roca siblings, is well-known for its free-style cooking and has long been hailed for its combination of Catalan dishes and cutting edge techniques.

With Joan Roca heading up the kitchen and his brothers Jordi and Josep as head pastry chef and head sommelier respectively, it has built up a reputation as one of Spain's most exciting places to eat.

France and America were the two countries with the most restaurants on the list, both notching up six in the top 50.

China also had three entries for the first time.

The list was drawn from the votes of more than 900 leading figures in the industry - including food critics, chefs, restaurateurs and highly regarded "gastronomes".

The World's 50 Best Restaurants Awards, sponsored by S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna, were presented at the Guildhall in central London.
