'I was losing myself in Guinness': Ricky Hatton has opened up about his drink and drugs problems

Ricky Hatton has revealed how his life became enveloped by drink and drugs – and that he came to the brink of suicide several times.

The former boxer admits that depression took hold after he lost his first-ever boxing match, to Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas in 2007.

He has described how he broke down in tears following the bout, feeling that he’d let everyone down, and turned to alcohol in a bid to block out his anguish.

The revelations come in Ricky's new book – War And Peace: My Story – extracts of which were published in The Sun on Sunday.

The 34-year-old said: ‘I was losing myself in Guinness after Guinness. I didn’t care what I looked like. I was on a suicide mission.’

Ricky said he tried to commit suicide with a knife on several occasions.

He said: ‘I lift the blade and terrible thoughts come into my head. I should end it sooner rather than later. The cold blade makes contact. I break the skin, pierce the flesh of my wrist. I just want to die.’

After losing to Manny Pacquiao in May 2009 in Las Vegas Ricky’s depression worsened and he turned to drugs.

He said: ‘I hoped drugs might make things better, shortly after the Pacquiao fight.’

A year later he was filmed by a newspaper snorting cocaine in a hotel room.

Ricky’s state of mind has much improved, in part thanks to help group Sporting Chance - founded by former Arsenal captain Tony Adams - which he said has taught him how to cope when things flare up.

Ricky, from Hattersley in Greater Manchester, had another daughter in July and took to Twitter to show off Fearne Grace Hatton.

He posted the news on his official page, before posting a couple of photos of the new arrival, one with his older children Campbell and Millie.

He posted at the time: 'Me & Jen just had another baby girl. 6lb 13oz,born 5.45am. She is lovely, perfect, Mum is fine also. I feel blessed.'

Defeat: Ricky lays on the ring in the second round after being knocked out by Manny Pacquiao of the Philippines on May 2, 2009 in Las Vegas

On the up: Ricky has said that he's in a much happier place now - partly due to the help he received from Sporting Chance
