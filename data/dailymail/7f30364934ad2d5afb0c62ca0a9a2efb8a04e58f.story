A district attorney has today decided not to file criminal charges against a man who fatally shot his 7-year-old son outside a western Pennsylvania gun store.

Mercer County District Attorney Robert Kochems announced he wouldn't charge Joseph Loughrey, 44, of Jefferson Township, with carrying a firearm without a license.

Kochems said he considered the charge, a misdemeanor punishable by up to five years in prison, because Loughrey's gun was loaded when he put it in his truck moments before the gun fired on December 8, killing his son, Craig.

The boy had been buckling himself into his safety seat in his father's truck when the handgun, which was placed on the truck's console, fired as Loughrey got into the front seat, police said.

Tragic: A Pennsylvania father accidentally shot his 7-year-old son, Craig, while he got into his truck in the parking lot of a western Pennsylvania gun store. He discovered he will not face charges today

Accident: Joseph V. Loughrey, 44, shot the boy in the chest. All charges against him were dropped today

Loughrey had removed the magazine from the pistol but didn't realize 
there was still a round in the chamber when he tried to sell the 9mm 
pistol at Twig's Reloading Den in East Lackawannock Township, about 60 
miles northwest of Pittsburgh, police said.

When the sale didn't go 
through, Loughrey brought the gun back to the truck, where it 
accidentally fired.

Kochems said in a statement that the evidence "shows that Mr. Loughrey 
recognized that he could not carry a loaded firearm in his vehicle and 
believed he unloaded the firearm at home before taking it to the dealer 
to attempt to sell it and another weapon."

Only people with a license to
 carry a concealed weapon may keep a loaded gun in their vehicle, said 
the statement.

Kochems said his investigation determined that Loughrey stored the gun 
at home in a locked location, separate from the magazine, from which 
Loughrey unloaded the bullets before taking the gun with him to sell 
that day. Loughrey had stored the gun that way since he last shot it 
over the summer.

Sorrow: 'I know that little kid was everything to him,' a friend of the father's told a local paper about the dad's relationship with his 7-year-old son, Craig, pictured, at the time

Unthinkable: Joseph Loughrey was questioned by state police about the shooting death of his son, Craig, pictured. Police said the father was cooperative and distraught and all charges were dropped today

Loughrey "only owned the weapon for the past two years and rarely 
practiced with it," Kochems said Tuesday in the statement. "He had 
failed to clear the chamber of the cartridge that caused his son's death
 the last time he had fired the pistol and did not do so when he picked 
it up months later and took it to sell."

Kochems said he still could have filed the unlicensed firearm charge 
because of Loughrey's "lack of understanding, practice and/or training" 
about how he should have properly stored the firearm, but he decided not
 to because Loughrey "had a mistaken but good faith belief that he had 
properly secured and stored the firearm unloaded in his home and his 
belief was the proximate cause of the death of his son and not that he 
was carrying the firearm in his vehicle."

Loughrey does not have a listed home telephone number and did not 
immediately return a call to a cellphone number obtained Wednesday by 
The Associated Press.

Kochems declined to comment beyond his statement, which stressed his belief in a constitutional right to own firearms.

'I own a number myself,' the statement said. 'Further, with the 
reduction of public safety forces firearms ownership may be becoming 
more necessary.

'Persons who make the decision to own a firearm for personal protection 
must realize that their primary purpose in owning the firearm is to kill
 someone or something. They have an obligation to know how the firearm 
works not just on the day they purchase it but on every occasion that 
they touch it and always remembering its purpose.'

Loughrey and Craig’s mother were divorced and the 44-year-old father had custody of the child over the weekend.

'I know that little kid was everything 
to him,' Mark McLaughlin, a friend and co-worker of Loughrey’s at 
Superior Well Services in Fredonia, told The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review at the time.

'He was a wonderful little kid. He was special. He was full of life, a lot of fun,' McLaughlin said.

Cleared: A father has been cleared after he accidentally shot his little boy. Craig Loughrey died from a gun shot fired as his father was pulling away from the Twigs Reloading Den in Mercer, Pa.
