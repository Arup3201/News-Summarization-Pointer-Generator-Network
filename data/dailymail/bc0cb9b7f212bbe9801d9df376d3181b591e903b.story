Badger culling plays only a ‘minor role’ in helping to control the spread of TB in cattle, a study has claimed.

Researchers from the University of Warwick analysed cases of the disease, looking at incidents on British farms dating back to the 1990s.

The study, published in the journal Nature, found that transmission of TB from badgers to cows plays only a ‘relatively minor role’ in the spread of the problem.

Not the answer: Badger cull trials in Somerset and Gloucestershire last year had disappointing results, and ministers have been under serious pressure to drop the project

The research also claimed that killing every cow in a herd once the disease has been detected, as Britain did in the 2001 foot-and-mouth crisis, would be an effective method of stemming the rise of bovine tuberculosis.

However this would involve slaughtering 640,000 cows in the first year alone – a policy the paper calls ‘extreme’ and ‘draconian’.

Cutting environmental transmission – which includes badgers, deer and 
pasture where the disease lingers - by 50 per cent, which could 
represent the impact of a large scale badger cull, would only reduce 
that growth to 6 per cent year, the research found.

Bovine TB costs the country £100million a year and ministers have 
struggled to come up with an effective method of controlling it.

Killing
 badgers has been the Government’s main answer. But trials in Somerset 
and Gloucestershire last year had disappointing results, and ministers 
have been under serious pressure to drop the project.

Effective method: A foot-and-mouth disease control zone during the 2001 outbreak. Killing every cow in a herd once the disease has been detected, as Britain did in the crisis, would be a way to stem the rise of bovine TB

Professor Keeling, who conducted the research with Dr Ellen Brooks-Pollock, said culling the entire herd if an animal tests 
positive would reducing infected cattle, numbers slaughtered and 
affected farms by 80 per cent compared to standard measures after six 
years.

Vaccinating cattle against the disease would also have a marked effect in reducing the disease, he said.Increased testing would also help.

Professor
 Keeling said: ‘Transmission is complicated, it’s multifaceted. This 
means you’ve got cattle-to-cattle transmission, you’ve got movement of 
infected animals and you’ve got infection from the environment and all 
of these play a role.

Other options: Vaccinating cattle against the disease would also have a marked effect in reducing the spread of the disease. Increased testing on the animals would also help

‘This means there’s no easy strategy that’s 
ever going to rapidly eradicate infection, and what we’ve predicted is 
without substantial changes in policy we’ re probably going to see this 
historical 10 per cent rise in cases year on year to continue.'

Last night farming minister George Eustice, whose department has come under fierce criticism for advocating badger culling, said: ‘What this paper proposes would finish off the cattle and dairy industry.’

But Dominic Dyer from the Badger Trust hailed the research, saying: ‘Maybe farmers will now give badgers a break and start focusing on methods that actually work.’
