Ronny Deila has given his 'sleeping bear' of a Celtic side a six out of 10 at best for the year-ending report card.

The Hoops lost their first league game in nine against Dundee United at Tannadice on Sunday but remain four points clear over Jackie McNamara's team and Aberdeen at the top of the Scottish Premiership.

Celtic are still in the William Hill Scottish Cup where they travel to Dundee in the fifth-round and they look forward to a League Cup semi-final against Rangers at Hampden Park at the beginning of February.

And after passing up on two chances to get into the Champions League the Parkhead side battled through to second place in their Europa League group and face Inter Milan in the last-32 tie later in the same month.

Ahead of the visit of Ross County in the league on Saturday, the Norwegian summed up the first six months of his tenure as Celtic boss.

'The results are good but I see so much possibilities there,' he said.

'When I see the possession and pressure we have and how we are controlling games, it is about getting possession into goal chances.

'With the potential we have, I would give us a five, six maybe.

'We have a long way to go but it is quite good also.

'This club is a sleeping bear. It is a huge club, we have so many talented players and good staff

'We have just have to have the energy to work and progress, want to learn and get better.

'If you have that you can reach your goals.'Â
