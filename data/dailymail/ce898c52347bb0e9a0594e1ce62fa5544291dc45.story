Half a point. That’s all it was. World No 1, and world No 3, played as a team over 36 holes. Half a point. Yet somehow, in the dwindling light of day one at Gleneagles, it felt almost like a win.

Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia were the Ryder Cup’s marquee pairing. They were Paul McGinley’s banker, without equal in either team on current form. Yet standing on the 17th tee, they were two down with two to play, having already lost their morning session.

Garcia was staring at the worst day of his life as a Ryder Cup player. He had been sent out morning and afternoon on nine previous occasions and had never drawn a blank. Now it was a real possibility.

This shows why starting right is always a good idea!

His shot at 17 was reasonable, then, but not exceptional. It made the green of the 194-yard par three, but with plenty left. Right to left, hole on a different tier. McIlroy, now playing the alternate shot, had it all to do. And, frankly, McIlroy hadn’t been doing much all day.

He drained it. Possibly the putt of the day, due to its complexity. Dead centre, too. So Europe were still in the game, heading down the last.

McIlroy, buoyed, took out his new prototype driver. The Nike Vapor. So called, one might suspect, because it had been a steaming nuisance all afternoon. And it was again.

Yet it was US captain Tom Watson who said that golf was not meant to be a fair game, and here was proof of it. McIlroy went savagely right, but good fortune intervened, gave him a handy rebound off a pine tree and a lie for Garcia that was far better than deserved. He played his best shot of the round, perhaps of the day, a three-wood out of the rough to the back off the green. McIlroy sprinted across the fairway to celebrate.

America, meanwhile, found sand at the front. They bogeyed, Europe got down in two to win the hole and the game was halved.

Viewed dispassionately it was a poor return from Europe’s strongest pairing. In that moment, however, it was the catalyst for much rejoicing. 

When Phil Mickelson, five times a major winner, begins checking his green maps while standing over a three foot putt, it is fair to assume he is feeling a little tense. Even on the first morning of the first day, the Ryder Cup has that effect.

It is no respecter of reputations, of grand slams, of world rankings.

It plays by different rules. It makes heroes of less than stratospheric talents like Ian Poulter, and fools of all-time greats like Tiger Woods. So, really, the thought that McIlroy and Garcia would sweep all before them simply because they are better than just about everyone else here, is bunkum.

Sure enough, while Garcia turned the air blue on the 15th tee, he did not have the same impact on the board. Europe are in the box seat, leading 5-3 after day one, but McIlroy and Garcia’s contribution was as small as it could be.

They lost the morning fourball to Mickelson and Keegan Bradley, halved the foursome with Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker. So much for the dream team, then. McIlroy was largely ineffectual, Garcia erratic. Even when put in good positions he failed to take advantage, and he left McIlroy in trouble too many times to mention.

The 15th, when Garcia’s language captured his feelings as emotively as his grim visage, was a case in point. With the pair’s second shot, McIlroy could do no more than bludgeon the ball back onto the fairway. In his head, he was perhaps uttering a few colourful phrases of his own.

If there was a hangover from the morning session, it was perhaps understandable. European golfers no longer choke on the last hole in Ryder Cups. At Medinah two years ago, 12 matches went down the 18th and Europe collected nine-and-a-half points from those encounters.

So when Mickelson sank his tiddler winning putt after neither of Europe’s prime partnership had reached a par-five green in regulation three, it would have sent a disturbing and unfamiliar shiver through the home camp. Garcia had chipped worryingly from rough into a bunker, but by then McGinley had already named his pairings for the foursomes, with both men retained as a team.

Had they bombed a second time it would have felt like a tactical error, even if Europe would still have had their noses in front.

Europe started Friday morning frustratingly but managed to claw their way back to earn a two-point lead

Without doubt, McGinley was looking to this duo as standard-bearers. Yet, largely, the standard was poor. Mickelson and Bradley were hardly bringing their A game either, as evidenced by their foursomes defeat later in the day. So the morning fourball was definitely a game Europe could have won had McIlroy, in particular, delivered even an approximation of the ability that has taken him to the pinnacle of golf’s rankings.

Instead, America were allowed to clean up at the death. Europe led by a hole coming away from the 15th, but Bradley eagled the 16th and Mickelson did the rest. ‘Find McIlroy and break him,’ was the instruction of Paul Azinger, the last American captain to win the Ryder Cup — and the afternoon session showed how close Tom Watson’s players came to doing that.

At the very least, it is hard to see how Garcia and McIlroy could have remained together at any stage on Saturday had they drawn a duck egg from close to 12 hours of golf on Friday.

Not that Mickelson and Bradley are a weak unit. By the end of the morning session, they had become the first American pair since Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins in 1979 to win four Ryder Cup games straight.

Yet the golf played on Friday did not have to be from the stars. High afternoon winds and higher anxiety saw to that and anyone expecting a masterclass from players of such pedigree would have left this corner of Perthshire sorely disappointed.

Far from an exhibition, the morning session in particular was more of a dust-up, a bundle in the playground.

The match fluctuated because the performances fluctuated, and wildly. McIlroy played the first hole like the world No 1, and the second like a player 500 places his inferior. 

He made precious few interventions worthy of his reputation, winning the 13th and 15th holes, to take the game from two down to all square, but on both occasions with straightforward pars to American bogeys.

Perhaps this was why, with so many great players struggling to find form, the residue of the last few days was forgotten. There was none of the predicted needle left over from the phoney war of words that invariably precedes this event.

Was McIlroy still smarting over Mickelson’s jibe about his legal complications? It did not look like it.

On the short buggy ride up to the ninth tee, the pair shared a back seat and Mickelson put his arm around the shoulders of his young rival, laughing. McIlroy smiled back.

They were both probably in need of consolation at that point. The Ryder Cup does that to people. Unlike McIlroy and Garcia, as a contest, it does not do things by halves.
