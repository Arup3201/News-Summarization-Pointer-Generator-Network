England look set to name Kyle Eastmond at inside centre for Saturday's opening Test against New Zealand after Billy Twelvetrees lost his race to be fit for the series opener at Eden Park.

Twelvetrees' ankle injury prevented him from training on Tuesday in the final practice session before head coach Stuart Lancaster names his team on Wednesday night.

The Gloucester back has been out since May 3 and his lingering fitness worries offer Eastmond the chance to win a third cap.

Chance: Eastmond impressed with two appearances in Argentina last year but has not played since April 27

England head into the three-match series with a much depleted squad but they can take heart from their last two performances against the All Blacks.

Lancaster's side beat New Zealand 38-21 - a record margin - in November 2012 before narrowly losing to the All Blacks 30-22 at Twickenham last year.

Eastmond, a rugby league convert, impressed during last summer's tour to Argentina but recently fell out of favour at Bath and has not played since April 27.

Operating inside the 24-year is expected to be another player who is fourth choice in his position - Leicester-bound Freddie Burns.

The fly-half has been desperately short of form when picked by Gloucester, but he appears to have edged out Danny Cipriani in the triple absence of Owen Farrell, Stephen Myler and George Ford.

England will otherwise select a familiar backline with Danny Care at scrum-half, Manu Tuilagi outside Eastmond at 13, Marland Yarde and Jonny May on the wings and Mike Brown at full-back.

The key decision in the forwards concerns who will partner Joe Launchbury in the second row, with Geoff Parling's line-out expertise likely to see him chosen ahead of the more abrasive Dave Attwood.

The front row picks itself with Rob Webber, who has overcome a knee problem, packing down alongside Joe Marler and David Wilson.

In the back row, the trio that finished the RBS 6 Nations will almost survive intact with the physicality of James Haskell likely to see him fill the shoes of Tom Wood, with Chris Robshaw at openside and Ben Morgan at No 8.

New Zealand also name their 23 on Wednesday, with Jerome Kaino in pole position to replace No 8 Kieran Read, who has been ruled out with concussion.

Record: England beat New Zealand 38-21 in November 2012 but will field a much weakened side at Eden Park

Glory: England celebrate beating New Zealand in 2012 but they will be missing key players on Saturday
