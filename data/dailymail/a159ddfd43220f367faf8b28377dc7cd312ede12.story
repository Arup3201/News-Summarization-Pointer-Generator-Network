An Italian footballer 
collapsed on the pitch and died from a heart attack in front of 
horrified teammates and supporters last night.

Former under 21 international Piermario
 Morosini, 25, who played for Livorno, was seen to tremble before 
falling to his knees and then to the ground midway through the first 
half.

Frantic players from 
both sides attracted the referee's attention as medics from Livorno 
rushed onto the pitch to give the player heart massage.

The Italian second division side were leading 2-0 against Pescara when the footballer fell to the ground.

The tragedy happened just four
 weeks after Bolton Wanderers footballer Patrice Muamba suffered a heart
 attack during an FA Cup quarter final against Tottenham Hotspur.

Despite his heart stopping for 78 
minutes, the footballer is expected to be discharged from the London 
Chest Hospital within days after making a remarkable recovery.

Yesterday
 reports suggested paramedics were delayed getting an ambulance onto the
 pitch to treat Morosini because a police car was parked in the wayÂ at Pescara's Adriatica Stadium.

The
 footballer was later taken away to the town's Santo Spirito hospital 
after he was seen being put onto a stretcher with an oxygen mask on his 
face.

The team medic continued to give him heart massage as shocked players and supporters watched on.

It was claimed a police car had blocked the ambulance's entrance to the ground.

Fire chiefs confirmed they 
had to smash the window and release the handbrake to move it out of the 
way.

Medics said attempts 
had been made to revive the player with a defibrillator while fans 
looked on stunned from the terraces but all attempts were futile.

Television footage showed the footballer's team mates distraught as they were told by Livorno club official Manilo Porcellini that Morosini had died an hour after arriving at hospital.

The footballer, on loan from Serie A side Udinese, never regained consciousness.

Pescara goalkeeper Luca Anania told Italian TV: 'This is a tragedy, believe me, I don't know what to say.

'There was such a great deal of 
confusion and I heard there was also a slight delay in getting the 
ambulance onto the pitch as its path was blocked by another vehicle.

'Some of my team mates helped carry the stretcher from the ambulance onto the pitch.'

Livorno's
 president Aldo Spinelli said: 'We are all in pieces. This is a tough 
moment for all of us but we need to try and come out of it together.

'We all need to have courage but
 at the moment things are all very confusing. Unfortunately there is 
nothing you can do to control destiny,' adding that Morosini had also 
lost his parents and his brother when he was a youngster.

Edoardo
 De Blasio, cardiologist at the Santo Spirito, confirmed that Morosini 
had died from a heart attack while another hospital official Leonado 
Paloscia, tried to down play the delay saying that 'thirty seconds here 
or there would not have made any difference.'

Italian
 FA chiefs immediately called off all fixtures due to be played as a 
mark of respect while local prosecutor Valentina D'Agostino was also 
called into investigate the circumstances of the tragedy.
