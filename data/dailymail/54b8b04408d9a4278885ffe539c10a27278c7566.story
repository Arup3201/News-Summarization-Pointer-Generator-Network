Embattled New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie kept his presidential hopes alive on Friday with an hour-long press conference that saw him tussling with journalists while insisting that his hands were clean in the 'Bridgegate' fiasco.

'The fact of the matter is I had nothing to do with this, as I said from the beginning,' he said of a September 2013 plot to close down on-ramp lanes to the George Washington Bridge as political payback for a Democratic mayor who failed to endorse his re-election effort.

'In the long sweep of things,' he predicted coyly, 'any voters, if they consider this issue at all, in considering my candidacy – if there ever is one at all – I’ve got a feeling it'll be a small element of it, if any element at all,' said Christie.

But reporters scraped and kicked their way to a series of gubernatorial outbursts that could portend one of American history's most colorful White House press briefing rooms.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sparred with reporters for an hour on Friday, while announcing the resignation of  the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey

A media crush met Christie in the New Jersey state capitol building as pressure built for him to comment publicly on the 'Bridgegate' scandal that has embroiled the potential 2016 Republican presidential contender

One journalist's pointed question, Christie scowled, was 'so awful that it’s beneath the job you hold.'

He barked to another: 'You have to get the facts right if you’re going to ask me a question.'

When the dust settled, he turned passive-aggressive in a way that New Jerseyans have come to recognize.

'It's such a joy and relief to be finally able to come back and interact with you in the kind and gentle way we always have,' Christie said to a room bulging with tape recorders, notebooks and TV cameras.

'I'd love to say I missed you, but I didn't. But I'm looking forward to having you all back on a regular basis.'

Christie's last press conference was on January 9 and lasted two hours.

He conceded during both events that the bridge scandal had shaken the confidence he once placed in his most senior staffers.

'It's obvious to me that I have to make clearer ... what's acceptable conduct and what is not,' he said Friday.

Friday's defiant Q-and-A came a day after the release of a formal report, commissioned by the governor and written by a hand-picked law firm. 

The embattled governor has a reputation for fearlessly taking as many questions as media organizations want to throw at him, and his answers are often headline-worthy

Attorney Randy Mastro delivered a lengthy Bridgegate report to reporters on Thursday, exonerating Christie but enraging Democrats who say the authors failed to talk to at leas ttwo key witnesses

The lengthy examination of the events of Sept. 9-13 exonerated Christie, while also leaving the door open for questions about the independence of the investigators.

But the Republican swashbuckler who figures prominently in most predictions of the GOP's 2016 presidential field – 'They love me in Iowa,' he told ABC's Diane Sawyer on Thursday – stood by the document's findings.

'This report has supported exactly what I said,' he told a packed room of reporters.

David Samson, a former New jersey attorney general and a long-time Christie ally, resigned Friday from his post as chairman of the powerful Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the George Washington Bridge

The report's authors, he insisted, 'have their own professional and personal reputations. Six of them were former federal prosecutors. They're not going to whitewash anything for me and put their reputations at stake.'

He declared that their work product would 'stand the test of time – and it will be tested by the other investigations that are going on.

New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman – Christie's successor in the job, and not a fan of the governor – is running his own investigation. A New Jersey special legislative committee dominated by New Jersey lawmakers is running its own probe.

Two of those partisans fired back Friday afternoon, saying the report was incomplete because it didn't include input from Bridget Kelly, the former deputy chief of staff whom Christie fired in January after the bridge scheme became national news.

Kelly sent an infamous email to David Wildstein, a Christie appointee at the New York/New Jersey port authority – which operates the George Washington Bridge – apparently signaling that a plan to alter its traffic patterns should go ahead.

'If we don't hear from the person who put the lane closures into motion, Bridget Kelly, who we know sent the email "Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee" ... if we don't know why she sent that email, if we don't know who gave her the authority to send that email, if we don't know what she thought she may be accomplishing by sending that email, then we can't have a complete picture of what happened here,' Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski told the Newark Star-ledger.

Wildstein, the Port Authority 
official, resigned in early December, and has since refused to testify 
before the legislative committee in Trenton.

Christie said Friday that it 'was a mistake' to hire him.

The man at the top of the Port Authority, David Samson, quit his post on Friday.

Samson's
 departure didn't appear related to the report, although the governor 
said he had 'tendered his resignation to me, effective immediately,' 
earlier in the day.

Samson also didn't figure in the report itself – because, as with the case of Bridget Kelly, investigators never spoke with him.

'The Governor's top appointee at the Port Authority refuses to be interviewed for the administration's report and then resigns the day after it comes out,' Wisneiwski noted in a joint statement Friday afternoon with fellow Democrat Loretta Weinberg, 'leaving us once again with far more questions than answers.'

'Any credible examination of the lane closures should be focused on uncovering the facts, not exonerating the governor or anyone else,' the two lawmakers said.

Cleared or not, a feisty and defiant Christie seemed to outlast a national press corps that was eager to see him slip.

Answering questions about how a plot to abuse traffic resources for political revenge could have escaped his notice.

As a chief executive, he said, deputies sledom strode into his office to brief him on minutiae.

'That's not the way it works,' he insisted.
