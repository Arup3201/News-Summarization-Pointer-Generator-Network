New research reveals office workers can save more than £1,300 over the year just by taking in lunch from home each day

The New Year will have many of us making resolutions to save money here and there.

And new research reveals office workers can save more than £1,300 over the year just by taking in lunch from home each day.

According to the survey on British office workers' lunch habits, a third were found to spend more than £5 on food and drink most days, which totals more than £100 
each month. And those who work near a luxury food store could be paying close to double that.

A thrifty fifth of the 4,000 surveyed claimed they pay out almost nothing at all on food or drink at the office.

Those
 daily £2.50 coffees can be banished by taking in a flask - you can pick one at around £10, making its money back in less than a week.

The survey by flexible workspace provider Regus highlights a polarity in spending habits and a growing concern about office cooking facilities which aren't fit for use.

More than half of professionals said they bring in their own packed lunch, while a frustrated fifth said they're hampered by inadequate kitchens at work.

Nearly two thirds reported that they eat more when they are stressed, and seven in ten eat healthier meals when they don't have a long commute.

'Finances and health usually come high up most people's priorities for the New Year and it is clear that making a few simple changes, like preparing food to take to work, can make a significant difference to monthly bank balances - and waistlines,' says a Regus spokesperson.

'Two thirds of firms, according to our previous research, recognise that smarter working practices like flexible working help staff maintain a healthier work-life balance, and seven in ten workers believe flexi-hours and multi-location working alleviate stress.'
