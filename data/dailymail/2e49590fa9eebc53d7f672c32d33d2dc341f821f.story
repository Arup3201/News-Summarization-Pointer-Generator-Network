My husband is wonderful at a great many things but gift selection is not among them.

So the run up to Christmas becomes increasingly rife with anxiety, amid regular pleas to 'just tell me what you want'. And he means exactly what I want, including a photograph with details, pricing and specific directions to the shop, which takes a certain amount of fun out of the unwrapping.

Lately I've noticed a large number of my friends' spouses saying much the same, and adding with utter resignation, 'she never likes what I choose'.

Ashley Pearson has the definitive shopping list for men who've left their wives and girlfriends' gifts until last

It's this dread and lack of confidence that means they leave it until the last minute and then, as one friend put it, they'll 'run out to whatever's open on Christmas Eve and making a grab for what's handy'.

So for those panic-stricken men who still haven't sorted it, here's an extensive gift guide for surviving Christmas.

Although December 25 is fast approaching, all the below can all still be purchased online this week and will arrive before the big day.
