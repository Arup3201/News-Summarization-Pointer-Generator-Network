One Capital One Cup final cameraman's afternoon got a whole lot wetter thanks to Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho.

With his side a goal to the good on a wet afternoon at Wembley Stadium, the Chelsea boss decided to have a bit of fun with a member of the TV crew by giving him a cheeky soaking with a water bottle.

Known for having an overall good relationship with members of the press, Mourinho followed his prank with a mischievous smile towards his unlucky victim.

And the smile continued on a successful outing for the Portuguese, as his side went on to beat Tottenham 2-0 to lift his first piece of silverware during his second stint in charge of the Blues.

A goal from captain John Terry and an own goal from Spurs defender Kyle Walker handed Chelsea their fifth League Cup title, helping Mourinho get his hands on this particular cup for the third time in his managerial career.

It was a solid performance from his men as they dampened Tottenham's week even further following their eviction from the Europa League on Thursday after defeat to Fiorentina.
