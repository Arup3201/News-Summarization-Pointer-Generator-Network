British No 2 James Ward could not follow up his impressive qualifying performance with another victory and exited the Shanghai Masters at the hands of Kevin Anderson.

The 27-year-old Londoner - ranked 119th in the world - trumped Russia's Viktor Troicki in straight sets on Sunday and looked good for a first-round win after taking the first set 6-3 against the big-hitting Anderson.

But the South African broke Ward twice in the second set to lead 4-0 and, despite the fact the Englishman clinched the fifth game to stem the tide, Anderson pushed through and took the deciding set to close out a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory.

Ward misses the opportunity to face Kazakh hopeful Mikhail Kukushkin - who beat Tommy Robredo 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) - in the second round of a tournament which also features Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic.

There was disappointment for US Open champion Marin Cilic in Shanghai as he fell 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 (7-2) to unseeded Croatian Ivo Karlovic.

John Isner of the United States got the better of Spain's Pablo Andujar over three sets, his 7-6 (7-5), 1-6, 6-3 win sending him into a meeting with either Andrey Golubev or compatriot Steve Johnson.

Marcel Granollers and Donald Young departed China early following respective defeats to Lu Yen-hsun and qualifier Malek Jaziri, while Juan Monaco was a 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) winner against Joao Sousa.
