New grandmother Princess Michael of Kent got into the Christmas spirit early this weekend as she headed out for a festive lunch with her family.

Dressed warmly in shearling and fur, Princess Pushy was joined by husband Prince Michael of Kent, daughter Lady Gabriella Windsor, 32, and son Lord Frederick Windsor, 34 at the appropriately named La Famiglia restaurant in Chelsea.

The foursome spent almost two hours inside the exclusive World's End haunt before heading back out into the chilly afternoon air.

Princess Michael wore a brown leather sheepskin jacket with a fur trim around the collar and a matching brown leather handbag, and appeared to be carrying a paper bag when she left the Chelsea restaurant

After their meal, Lord Freddie held the restaurant door open for his sister and parents

The family appeared to leave their personalised black BMW car on double yellow lines for over 1 and half hours

But more than a few eyebrows were raised
 when it was discovered that the Royal couple had chosen to leave their 
black BMW on double yellow lines for more than an hour while tucking 
into an Italian lunch at the restaurant.

It isn't the first time that Princess Michael, 68, has ruffled feathers in recent weeks.

10 days ago, she launched an impassioned defence of her right to complain about being made to pay rent on her lavish Kensington Palace apartment and claimed she and her husband, cousin to the Queen, lived in ‘austere economic times'.

Speaking to the Times, she revealed how she and husband Prince Michael, 71, have been forced to embrace austerity along with the rest of the country, eating all their meals at home since dining in restaurants has become too much of an extravagance, and flying by budget airline easyJet.

But it seems her austere new lifestyle doesn't extend to the Christmas period, with the royal pair seemingly happy to bend the ‘no dining out’ rule.

Prince Michael walked by his daughter's side after the meal, laughing and talking and the royal couple were then seen pointing at an antique shop window at an item which had taken their eye

After hugs and kisses, Lord Freddie walked in one direction and the rest of the family were seen driving off in the BMW

The intimate luncheon was kept low key, with just the family in attendance and with no security present.

During
 the meal, the family tucked into Italian classics such as cuttlefish 
risotto and roast wild boar with rosemary, garlic and olive oil served 
with swiss chard.

For the lunch, the princess wore a brown sheepskin 
jacket with a fur collar, and a matching brown leather 
handbag which she paired with loose black slacks and a jade necklace.

The 
rest of the family also dressed down for the gathering, with the 
exception of Prince Michael who wore a pair of bright green 
trousers.

As the family left the restaurant, Princess Michael was seen holding a La Famiglia branded bag, (taking home some leftovers in an attempt to save a few more pennies?), although that didn't stop her from eyeing up an interesting piece on display in the window of a nearby antique shop.

After the lunch, Prince and Princess Michale returned to their car with daughter Lady Gabriella Windsor, 32

After a flurry of hugs and kisses, Lord Freddie walked in one direction while the rest of the family piled into the BMW.

Although it is not yet known whether the family will be joining the Queen and the rest of the Royal Family for Prince George’s first Christmas at the Sandringham estate, a large number of Windsors are said to be attending this year and an appearance seems likely.

If the couple do attend, the princess certainly won’t have any problems finding stocking fillers, as she is currently is promoting her first novel, The Queen of Four Kingdoms, the first in a trilogy.
