There's no better feeling than leaving the hairdressers with a brand new 'do.

Now research has found that the average British woman changes their hairstyle 36 times in a lifetime.

A study has quizzed 560 women between the ages of 18 and 65 on their hairstyle habits.

Research has found that the average British woman changes their hairstyle 36 times in a lifetime. Victoria Beckham has cut her hair into a elfin bob but often returns to her signature long tresses 

The former Spice Girl's styles have inspired copy cat looks  - such as her well known 'Pob' (left) and her original long bob (right)

The study by Fabriah.com found mere six per cent of women stick to the same hairstyle for life.

The majority of the rest of us - 41 per cent - will change the cut every 
two years, whereas 19 per cent change it yearly.

Four per cent of women questioned change their look every six months.

The most popular look for women was shoulder length hair - with 48 per cent of us returning to the mid length.

A quarter of women prefer chin length cuts, six per cent prefer a crop, but 22 per cent prefer long hair.

One respondent said: 'I tend to change my hair every few years but only very slightly. I may have a bit extra cut off the length, more layers put in or add a fringe.

'With colour I’m a bit more fickle – during the winter I like a warm, rich shade and in the warmer months something much lighter.'

Model Kate Moss is well known for her flowing 'boho style' (left) but she has also sported a sleeker 'do (right) with well conditioned one-length locks and fringe

Another added: 'I’ve had the same style for about 25 years and wouldn’t dream of changing it. It works for my face shape and is easy for me to look after.

'In the past I’ve experimented with all sorts of styles from very long hair, a dreadful tight perm to a pixie crop. The cut I have now is definitely the one for me.'

A third said: 'I’ve had the same hair colour for the last four years and am now thinking about changing it.

Princess of Pop Kylie Minogue has also been somewhat of a style chameleon, with both boyish crops (right) and sixties style bobs (left)

'I love the shade, but as I get older my skin tone is changing so I need something a little warmer. I have a great hairdresser who will get the colour perfect.'

A third of women change their colour every three years, whereas 12 per cent change the shade of their locks every two years.

Some six per cent change their colour every six months, but 17 per cent have never dyed their hair.
