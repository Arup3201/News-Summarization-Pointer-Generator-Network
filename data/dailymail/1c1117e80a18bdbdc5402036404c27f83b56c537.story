Speaking out: Ireland Hobert-Hoch, 13, said she didn't want to be aware of how much she weighed

A 13-year-old student was sent to the principal's office after refusing to be weighed in front of her classmates during gym class.

A teacher at Southeast Polk Junior High in Pleasant Hill, Iowa was measuring the heights and weights of students to calculate their body mass index when Ireland Hobert-Hoch said no.

She said she did not want to be weighed because it made her - and other classmates - uncomfortable and she does not think she should be worried about her weight.

'I don't feel like it's their business,' she told the Des Moines Register. 'I feel like it's my doctor and my mom and my own business. Maybe not even my own because I don't need to know that right now.'

But the teacher would not allow the straight-A student to sit it out - and instead sent her to the principal's office.

School principal Mike Daily said the teenager was not sent to him because of her refusal but because of how it 'was presented to the teacher', HuffPo reported.

He said that students have been getting their heights and weights measured as part of the FitnessGram program since before he started at the school four years ago. He said the results are confidential.

The school board will discuss the issue at upcoming meetings and will decide if it should continue. Staff say that the measurements are required to assess the child's health.

Support: Her mother, Heather Hobert-Hoch, said she does not want her daughter to be worried about her body or what she is eating. The school told her that they are the first family to ever complain

The girl's mother, Heather Hobert-Hoch, said that when she called the school to complain about how her daughter had been treated, the school offered no apologies for how it had acted.

'When I voiced my concerns they said, "We've done this for years, and you are the only one complaining",' she told the Register.

Ireland said she wanted to step forward so that other girls who felt uncomfortable didn't have to have their weights taken either.

She said that while she was talking with the teacher about it, some students just told her to do it so that she didn't get in trouble. But still, she refused.

Scene: Staff at Southeast Polk Junior High School said the tests were carried out to determine if the students have healthy BMIs. They will be discussing the issue at upcoming board meetings

'I don't want other people being weighed,' she said. 'I thought if I did that then... it would make other people stand up and say no - which it did.'

She said that she had been brought up to not be concerned about her weight or how she looked.

'[My mother] told me that you don't need to know that, it's not important. It doesn't make up who are. She didn't want me to constantly worry about what I weigh - like other girls,' she said.  

Her mother, Heather, said that the family stopped using a scale years ago and she has noticed that her daughter has been much happier since.

'I wanted to get rid of it as an issue', she said. 'I didn't want it to affect her eating. I just don't want her to become so worried about weight that it defines who she is.'
