All children taken to accident and emergency units will have their details put through a computer database designed to identify those who may be victims of abuse, ministers said yesterday.

The £9million system will be designed to find children whose visits to casualty are not their first.

It will also identify children who are living in state care or whose families are under the supervision of social workers.

The Child Protection – Information System, which follows two failed attempts to combat child abuse by storing information in computer databases, will save lives by identifying abused or vulnerable children, claim ministers.

Children taken to accident and emergency departments will have their details logged on a national database in a bid to crackdown on child abuse

But MPs and civil liberties groups 
warned that innocent families could find themselves cast under suspicion
by the system and that misuse of its information could lead to children
being wrongly taken into care.

The database, announced by health 
minister Dan Poulter, will link NHS records of A&E visits with 
registers held by local council children’s services departments when it 
goes into operation in 2015.

Dr Poulter said: ‘Doctors and nurses are often the first people to see children who are victims of abuse.

‘Up until now, it has been hard for 
frontline healthcare professionals to know if a child is already listed 
as being at risk or if children have been repeatedly seen in different 
emergency departments or urgent care centres with suspicious injuries or
complaints, which may indicate abuse.

‘Providing instant access to that 
information means vulnerable and abused children will be identified much
more quickly – which will save lives.’

The scheme has won support from medical professionals and charities.

Dr Simon Eccles, an A&E 
consultant at Homerton University Hospital, London, who helped plan the 
system, said: ‘It is quite straightforward, I hope, most of the time, to
ascertain whether this is just a child who is beautifully looked after 
but tends to play rough, or this is a child who is not ever being 
watched when they play and tend to hurt themselves.’

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme
that medical staff could take a case ‘up the ladder’ if they believed a
child was at risk.

‘This database is not trying to solve
the entire problem but simply adding another layer of information that 
previously was hard to get,’ Dr Eccles added.

But critics warned that parents could
face suspicion if hospital staff use the database wrongly or bring in 
social workers too quickly. Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, a 
campaigner against the abuse of social work powers, said: ‘We have to be
very careful not to require parents to prove their innocence.

‘There are cases where there is clear
evidence that parents are not guilty of abuse but it is ignored. It 
does nobody any good to take the wrong children into care.’

Mr Hemming added: ‘We need to encourage people to go to A&E departments when their children are hurt, not to put them off.

‘We don’t need a situation where if you take your child to A&E three times, the child goes into care.
‘Hospitals already use information wrongly and I am worried about the way information on the new system may be used.’

Nick Pickles, of civil liberties 
group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Parents need reassuring that a 
ham-fisted approach to databases – sadly something the NHS is well known
for – will not end up with information about children on the desks of 
over-zealous social workers.

‘The Government needs to clarify 
urgently that the only children who will see any change as a result of 
this system will be those who are already registered as at risk.’

Last year, more than 4.5million young people aged 19 and under attended A&E – a rise of 4.7 per cent on the previous year.

The number of patients of all ages 
going to casualty has surged by 50 per cent to more than 21million in 
the past decade – partly due to an increase in population and a loss of 
public faith in out-of-hours GP services.
