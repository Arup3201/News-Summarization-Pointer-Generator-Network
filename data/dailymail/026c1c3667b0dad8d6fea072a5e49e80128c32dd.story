The remains of two U.S. airmen killed during a night mission in the Vietnam war are to be flown home for burial more than 40 years after their aircraft crashed in Laos.

Major Howard V Andre Jr, from Memphis, and Major James E Sizemore, from Illinois, had been listed as missing in action since July 1969 until their remains were identified in April this year.

Their bodies are due to returned to their families, and given a full military burial at Arlington Cemetery on Monday.

Missing: Pilot Major James Sizemore was flying the aircraft the night the two airmen were shot down

Major Andre, 34, and Major Sizemore, 38, were killed when their A26 bomber, which had been used in the Second World War, crashed during a night reconnaissance mission in Laos.

Search: The remains of Major Sizemore and his navigator were identified earlier this year

When the crash site was located earlier this year by excavation teams from the U.S. and Laos, the men were identified and personal items were collected.

'We have made a commitment as a state 
and country to never forget the sacrifices of Prisoners of War and those
still Missing In Action,' Veterans Affairs Commissioner 
Many-Bears Grinder told Fox News.

Major Sizemore was flying the aircraft, and Major Andre was acting as his navigator when they were hit by enemy fire, according to the POW Network.

In an online tribute, James Sizemore said his father had been returning to a base in Thailand after a bombing mission over the Ho Chi Min trail when he crashed.

A ground team was said to have later 
reported that the men could not have survived the crash and they were 
listed as 'killed in action - body not recovered'.

When
the servicemen are laid to rest on Monday, an unofficial flyover, including the same model of aircraft the airmen had been using, will take 
place near the cemetery.

It is being organized by the Warrior Flight Team, and all the aircraft will be flown by veterans.

Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam has also ordered flags to be flown at half mast on state buildings to honor Major Andre.

Honor: The airmen will receive a full military burial at Arlington on Monday

'The recovery of Major Andre is a reminder that our commitment to remember should endure until all of our service members are brought home,' Ms Grinder said.

The Defense POW Department uses a team of about 100 people to help trace missing servicemen and prisoners of war from the Second World War to current conflicts.

More than 83,000 American servicemen are still unaccounted for since the Second World War.
