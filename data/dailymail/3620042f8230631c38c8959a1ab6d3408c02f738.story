The husband of a third grade teacher has admitted promoting prostitution out of a downtown office building.

Mark Fiedler and his wife Laura, a 
former Springfield Public Schools teacher, are accused of arranging
meetings between people seeking sex through online ads and alleged 
prostitutes.

When arrested the couple told police that they thought they were arranging clients for employees hired to give massages on the third floor of the Landmark building in Springfield, Missouri.

Mark Fiedler has admitted the Class C felony of promoting prostitution in the second degree. He and wife Laura are accused of arranging meetings between people seeking sex through online ads and alleged prostitutes

Police believe the Fiedlers had up to five women working for them in the 100-year-old building.

The 43-year-old has admitted the 
Class C felony of promoting prostitution in the second degree, which 
could put him in prison for seven years.

The
case against his 36-year-old wife, a third grade teacher, continues. She is charged with the 
Class D felony of promoting prostitution in the third degree.

That charge carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison if convicted.

A pre-trial conference is set for next week, News-Leader reported.

The charges claim that detectives found the business advertised on a website called backpage.com under the adult category and made contact to establish what was offered and the cost, KY3.com reported last year.

A meeting was arranged at the building and the police moved in. The pair was arrested and charged in 2012.

'He's charged essentially with managing the prostitution business, whereas she's charged with assistance in that business,' Greene County Prosecuting  Attorney Dan Patterson told KY3.com at the time of the charge.

The prosecutor explained the delay in filing charges was due to the complex nature of the investigation.

'Much of the case is built upon records, phone records, and other records that have to be obtained from companies.

'It takes them awhile to generate those documents, to provide them to law enforcement, and then for law enforcement to take the time to analyze those documents,'  Patterson told KY3.com.
