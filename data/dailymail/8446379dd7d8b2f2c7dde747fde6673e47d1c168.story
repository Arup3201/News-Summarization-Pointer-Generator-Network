The famous slogan of the Cadbury's Creme Egg is 'how do you eat yours?' but have you ever wondered how exactly they are made?

The chocolate treats sell millions every year in the run up to Easter and now for the first time, the secret of how the famous egg is created can be revealed.

The factory in Bourneville, Birmingham, makes around 1.5 million of the sweets every day in an operation that Willy Wonka could only dream of.

Revealed: The factory in Bourneville, Birmingham, makes around 1.5 million of the sweets every day in an operation that Willy Wonka could only dream of

These fascinating pictures reveal the 
complex and high-tech process that goes into making the half a billion 
chocolate eggs sold around the world each year.

Amazingly, the process is not as simple as pressing two bits of egg shaped chocolate together and injecting the creamy goodness inside.

Cadbury executive Tony Bilsborough explained: 'The process of making the creme egg was a Eureka moment and is not done in the way that most Easter eggs are formed.'

Instead the entire egg and the creamy interior are fused together while they are still in liquid form.

Mr Bilsborough said: 'A blob of liquid milk chocolate goes into a half egg shape mould where it is levelled.

Fusion: Straight away a blob of white fondant goes on top of the still-melted chocolate and the orange fondant is then added

Cool down: Once the fusing process is complete, cool air is blown onto the eggs for 40 minutes to set them

'Straight away a blob of white fondant goes on top of the still-melted chocolate. The two liquids don’t mix because the fondant is of a higher density.

'The orange fondant, of even higher density, is then added. The other half of the egg , which is chocolate and white fondant is then put on top.

'Because the whole egg is still liquid the chocolate surrounds the filling and completes the egg shape.

'Once the fusing process is complete, cool air is blown onto the eggs for 40 minutes and once solidified, a hammer is gently tapped on the mould and the completed eggs drop down onto a ramp.

'A robot sucks the eggs off the ramp placing them onto trays then another machine mechanically wraps each egg in foil.' 

Nearly ready! Once solidified, a hammer is gently tapped on the mould and the completed eggs drop down onto a ramp ready for the wrapping stage

Hundreds are wrapped each minute at the nut-free factory, which operates 364 days of the year.

The premises were built just for Creme Eggs in 1986.

They are the UK’s top selling confectionery item between New Year's Day and Easter, a period known as the ‘Creme Egg season’.

Around half of the factory output is sold abroad, mostly to the US and Canada where they are sold under license by Hershey

Quality checks: Cadbury now claims 85 per cent of the filled egg market in the UK

The eggs are manufactured as a slightly smaller shape for the US market and the colour green is added to the egg’s red, blue and yellow classic foil wrap.

Filled eggs were first made by the Cadbury brothers in 1923, but the Creme Egg in its current form was created in 1971.

Cadbury now claims 85 per cent of the filled egg market in the UK.

The company that began as a grocer’s shop selling cocoa in 1824 uses one million litres of English and Welsh milk and 60,000 tonnes of Guanan cocoa to produce three billion chocolate items every year, including the Creme Eggs.

Secrets revealed: The white and yellow fondants remain separate because they're different densities

Creme Eggs were first manufactured back in 1923 by the Cadbury Brothers

The Creme Egg of today is different to the original and wasn't introduced until
1963

The egg was originally called a Fry's Creme Egg (because of the Fry's
brand), and was then re-branded as the Cadbury's Creme Egg in 1971

The foil that the egg is wrapped in was originally green, red, yellow and
blue in the UK and Ireland

The colour green was removed and purple replaced blue in the
21st century

There have so far been 25 versions such as the Berry Creme Eggs (Australia), Mint Creme Egg, Creme
Egg ice cream, Creme Egg Twisted, Jaffa Egg (New Zealand), Screme Eggs (For Halloween), Giant
Creme Eggs, and Caramilk Egg

In 1955 one of the first fully automatic chocolate egg machines was installed at Bournville. This meant that for the first time mould heating, depositing of the liquid chocolate, rotation of the moulds to achieve uniform thickness, cooling and de-moulding of the two halves of the egg took place in a series of mechanical operations.

Over the years this process has been refined, production speeds have been greatly increased and machinery has become computer controlled.

The latest Creme Egg plant at Bournville is a sophisticated computer controlled operation capable of producing up to 1.5 million eggs each day

HOW DO YOU EAT YOURS?

Cadbury introduced the classic Creme Egg advertising slogan ‘How Do You Eat yours?’ in 1985 - so what was the most popular answer?

- bite off the top, lick out the creme then eat the chocolate (53 per cent)

- bite straight through (20 per cent)

- use your finger to scoop out the creme (16 per cent)
