The three Samoan players dropped for Saturday's opening Four Nations Series match against England have each been fined £5,500 ($10,000 Australian dollars), the National Rugby League have announced.

Reni Maitua, Tautau Moga and Sauaso Sue have been punished for their part in a nightclub incident in Brisbane last weekend.

Nick Weeks, the NRL's general manager of integrity, said: 'These are very substantial penalties for the players involved.

'And we will continue to take a tough stance against players who damage the reputation of our game through these kinds of incidents.' 

Samoa's coach Matt Parish stood the players down from the England match after it was revealed they were the subject of an NRL Integrity Unit review.

Moga was arrested after a brawl outside a club in Brisbane's Fortitude Valley where Samoan players had been taken to meet invited fans.

The trio are likely to return in time to play New Zealand in Samoa's next game.

Samoa's line-up for the first of two Four Nations matches on Saturday still includes some genuine firepower, with stand-off Ben Roberts no doubt keen to impress future Super League opponents ahead of his move to Castleford. 

Other NRL stars keen to upset the ambitions of Steve McNamara's side include North Queensland's Antonio Winterstein, St George-Illawarra's Kyle Stanley and Canterbury-Bankstown's Frank Pritchard. 

St Helens prop Mose Masoe and either Wakefield hooker or half-back Pita Godinet should be named on the bench.
