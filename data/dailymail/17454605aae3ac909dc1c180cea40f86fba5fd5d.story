Authorities say 12 elementary school students have been injured after their school bus overturned on a North Texas highway as the driver became distracted.

The Texas Department of Public Safety says the Waxahachie Independent School District bus ended up on its side Tuesday morning.

Trooper James Colunga says 19 children and the driver were on board during the wreck midway between Waxahachie and Boyce.

Overturned: The bus lay on its side off a Texas highway after the accident which saw 12 children injured

Lucky escape: The driver was distracted by something happening behind him, took his eyes off the road and swerved before over-correcting, causing the bus to tip over

He says 12 children have injuries not believed to be life-threatening and were transported to hospitals to be checked.

The children are suffering head and neck pain and abdominal problems, reports NBC. The most serious injury appears to be a young boy's broken arm.

The driver wasn't hurt.

Colunga says the driver was monitoring the children, became distracted, the bus wheels left the road and the vehicle overturned during the morning route.

According to NBC, the driver saw something in the back of the bus that distracted him, causing him to look away from the road and swerved before over-correcting, which caused the bus to overturn.

Clean-up: The bus was towed and the injured children taken to hospital - there were no injures more serious than a broke arm

The bus was near Farm-to-Market Rd and Ike road at around 6:50am when the accident occurred.

School district officials did not immediately identify the driver.

'I want to applaud the emergency crews for their quick action to help our students and families,' Waxahachie ISD Superintendent Dr. Jeremy Glenn said in a news release.

'The safety and security of our students will always be our No. 1 priority.'

Waxahachie is 25 miles south of Dallas.
