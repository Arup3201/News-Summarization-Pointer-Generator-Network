These incredible pictures reveal the stunning yet stark contrast between the bright lights of London and the peaceful tranquility of the English countryside.

Italian-born photographer Alessio Andreani, who now lives in London, has spent weeks capturing iconic images of some of the most famous landmarks in the capital including the Houses of Parliament, the Shard and Battersea Power Station.

In contrast, the 26-year-old has also spent time in Cornwall shooting some of the country’s most beautiful and rugged landscape including the coastline at Land’s End and St Ives.

Mr Andreani, who spends hours in each location to familiarise himself before photographing the landscape, said that despite the contrasting differences, he found some similarities between the differing locations.

He said: ‘I've really challenged myself to take pictures in a different environment.

‘I visited Cornwall to find the beautiful natural landscapes that I'm used to seeing in my home country.

‘As a result I found a nice contrast, but I noticed some similarities too - between nature and man-made landscapes.

‘I like the symmetry you see in the cityscapes, like in the shot with the Millennium Bridge and St Paul's dome or the shiny beauty of the Shard.

Mr Andreani said: 'I like the symmetry you see in the cityscapes, like in the shot with the Millennium Bridge and St Paul's dome or the shiny beauty of the Shard'

The landscape photographer said he spends several hours at each location before taking the stunning images and likes to watch the sunrise or sunset

‘The hard shapes and shiny surfaces are so different from the nature but they works great in the same way.’

The landscape photographer, who has taken images all over the world, said he particularly shooting along the English coastline.

During his recent trip to Cornwall, he spent time at Land's End, as well as in the quaint seaside town of St Ives and captured stunning images at Carnewas and Bedruthan Steps on the north Cornish coast between Padstow and Newquay.

Mr Andreani said: 'I love the beauty found in the natural setting and the powerful forces that have created cliffs and natural arches. It's really amazing and peaceful to admire during a sunset or sunrise.' Pictured: The sun breaks over Land's End in Cornwall
