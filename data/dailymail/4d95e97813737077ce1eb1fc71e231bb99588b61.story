Julia Mulligan, the North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner

Police officers were forced to hire a police car to go on duty – because the crime commissioner had borrowed theirs for a meeting.

Julia Mulligan, North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, borrowed the car as hers had a flat tyre.

But when she didn’t return it the next day, officers had no choice but to hire a replacement just so they could go on their rounds.

The commissioner had been given a police ‘pool’ car which officers can book if needed, eventually returning it two days after she had borrowed it.

An investigation was launched following a complaint, but Miss Mulligan was cleared of any wrongdoing.

The complaints committee which 
investigated the matter was told by the commissioner’s office that her 
busy schedule meant she could not find time to arrange a repair.

Ms Mulligan's office said it was an 'oversight' not to realise the car would not be able to be returned before other officers had booked to use it at 7am the next day.

The police and crime panel said the £60.34 cost to hire a car for the officers was less than what Miss Mulligan would have claimed in mileage expenses if she had been using her own car.

However, a report explaining the circumstances to the complaints committee conceded that “minor changes” would be made to the way vehicles are used following the incident.

The anonymous complaint that sparked the investigation was initially addressed to York Council leader James Alexander who passed it on to the panel.

He said: 'The correct place to investigate this anonymous complaint was at the police and crime panel and I was not surprised no further action was deemed necessary.

'Some will be surprised the commissioner was authorised to use the vehicle in question and I understand procedures will be updated in light of this investigation.'

We have been asked to make clear that Julia Mulligan did not borrow a police patrol car. The borrowed car was a civilian car used by staff. We are happy to clarify this.
