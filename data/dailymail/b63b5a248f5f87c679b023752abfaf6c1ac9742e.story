Manchester City are sweating on the availability of Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony for their top of the table clash with Chelsea on Saturday – but whether the two Ivorians can play may come down to the luck of the draw.

Ivory Coast face Cameroon on Wednesday night knowing that a win will guarantee them a place in the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations, and keep the City stars in Equatorial Guinea for at least another week.

But, if they lose, Toure and Bony will head home on Thursday, and could be ready to face Chelsea this weekend.

However, things get more complicated if they draw Wednesday’s crucial show-down. The Ivorians could have their fate decided off the pitch, by the drawing of lots.

Despite a star-studded line-up of players based at top European clubs, the Elephants have drawn both of their first two games 1-1.

And, remarkably, both the other games in the group, which also features Cameroon, Mali and Guinea, have also ended with the same scoreline.

That means that, going into the final round of fixtures, all four teams are level on points, head-to-head, goal difference and goals scored.

Should that remain the same after Wednesday night’s games, lots would have to be drawn to determine which two sides go through to the quarter-finals, and which two are eliminated.

That means if both games end in the same score draw then all four teams will need to be picked out of a hat to determine their position in the group.

But, even if one game ends with a positive result, were the other to be a draw there would still need to be lot drawing to decide who goes through, and who goes out, of the teams that finished level.

And, just to complicate matters further, two wins by the same score would see a toss-up to see who finishes first and second in the group.

If the sides do need to be separated by picking out of a hat, CAF have confirmed that the draw will take place immediately after the games in Malabo on Wednesday night.

But amid all the permutations, Manuel Pellegrini must be quietly hoping that Cameroon can show more cutting edge than in their first two games, freeing his stars to return to Manchester on Thursday morning without relying on luck.
