Arsene Wenger wore that haunted look - even more so than usual.

Every picture of the Frenchman on the Emirates Stadium touchline as his Arsenal side were humbled by a vulnerable but voracious Manchester United was a snapshot of inner turmoil and despair.

He was riled and restless, pacing up and down like an innocent prisoner thrown into a cell. The arms were locked and folded, a stance that said 'none of you are doing what I told you.'

Occasionally, his arms would lash out, his fingers jabbing out but the point lost in the cold November air. And when Wayne Rooney doubled United's lead with five minutes remaining, sealing a most unlikely victory, Wenger clawed at his forehead, his face a mask of horror.

This was not how it was meant to be. Wenger had waited a hell of a long time to beat United and this was their best chance in years. Louis van Gaal's side were a wounded animal, drained of strength by a nightmare injury list and bruised by bad results that had dented their old confidence.

But the beast still had its claws and Wenger's agonising wait goes on. To be precise, it is now 1,302 days since Arsenal last beat United.

That last success was on May 1, 2011 - eight meetings ago - when Aaron Ramsey scored the decisive goal and Arsenal beat Sir Alex Ferguson's team. Even that was inconsequential - United still wrapped up the title a week later and Arsenal finished fourth, something they've made a habit of doing since.

And there's a very good reason why they keep coming fourth. It is 1,122 days since they last defeated Chelsea and 838 since they beat Manchester City in the league.

Going back to the season after the Invincibles, Arsenal's record against City, United and Chelsea reads: Played 63 Won 17 Drawn 17 Lost 29 For 65 Against 99.

This means they have taken 68 points from a possible 189 against the three leading title contenders during the last decade. They simply don't perform in the big games.

Taking City out of the equation, they have won just eight of their last 42 matches against United and Chelsea.

It is pertinent to mention that fantastic team of 2003-2004 because Wenger still seems to be dining out on it. The decade since has been one of perpetual disappointment and 10 years is a tremendously long time in this game. He simply wouldn't still be in his post at most other clubs.

Arsenal's 8-2 loss at United in August 2011 was the most humiliating of their poor results against them

Beating the likes of Burnley and Crystal Palace is all well and good but Arsenal - and Wenger - have failed in the important, season-defining contests for far too long.

With 17 points from their opening 12 matches, this is Arsenal's worst ever start in the Premier League and it is remarkable the Arsenal faithful aren't in open mutiny.

With Jurgen Klopp, long mooted as Wenger's successor, admitting for the first time this week that he will listen to offers from England, change must surely be afoot.

While Wenger retains plenty of loyalists, there is a groundswell of opinion, especially amongst the Arsenal Twitterati, that he can take them no further than fourth and fresh ideas and fresh energy is required.

Ideas, or the lack of them, certainly came into it against United.

As Wenger said afterwards: 'It was a game that we dominated for 80 per cent of the time and it's a long time since we have dominated games against Manchester United like we did today.'

True, but why then did they lose? Arsenal were naive in underestimating a well below-strength opposition and horrendously profligate in front of goal.

They enjoyed 61 per cent of the ball and created 23 chances, something unheard of against United teams of old. Yet they scored just once, in the fifth minute of injury time when the contest was over.

It was painfully evident that Wenger didn't know where to position Danny Welbeck, who had a point to prove against his former club, switching him from out wide to in the middle and then back out wide and then back to the middle - all during the first-half.

It was the kind of slapstick that Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the stars of Dumb and Dumber sat in the stands, would have been proud of.

Aaron Ramsey and Alexis Sanchez should have been tormenting an inexperienced back-line of Tyler Blackett and Patrick McNair but seemed to fade on the big occasion.

Jack Wilshere was more effective going forward but could easily have seen red for his sticking his head into Marouane Fellaini's chin. Wenger will pray his latest injury isn't serious.

That it took a wasteful Arsenal 95 minutes to breach United's back line said it all. Wenger looked anguished at the final whistle, what should have been a comfortable win ending in a defeat and he knew he had no excuses.

That's something that could be applied to his tenure as a whole. He's benefited from a patient hierarchy and plenty of cash, especially of late, and yet Arsenal continue to tread water. 

The excuses have dried up. The clock is ticking.
