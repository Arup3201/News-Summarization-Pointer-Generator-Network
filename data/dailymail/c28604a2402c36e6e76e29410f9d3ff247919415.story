A young Arsenal fan returned home from school on Thursday to discover Jack Wilshere waiting for a kickabout in his back garden.

The Arsenal midfielder had decided to visit schoolboy Archie Hill after being told about his appeal to Prime Minister David Cameron.

Archie, who suffers from life-limiting muscle wasting disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, had asked for help with his condition.

The nine-year-old approached Mr Cameron after a breakthrough drug for his condition - which currently means he is unlikely to live beyond 30 - became available in several European countries.

After the meeting, Mr Cameron raised the issue of treatment in the House of Commons, saying he wanted to see vital drugs licensed as quickly as possible.

Wilshere was impressed with how Archie had written to the Prime Minister asking for some help in his fight against the debilitating illness.

The 23-year-old England star subsequently paid a visit to the youngster's home, before having a kickabout in his back garden with brother Leyton and playing PlayStation with the pair.

Wilshere said: 'It's been fantastic meeting Archie and Leyton. My mum told me about Archie's interview and I was really impressed by how grown up he was to go on television and to write to the Prime Minister like that. They are really great boys.'

Wilshere's meeting with the boys was organised by the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign

Archie's mum, Louisa, told the Mirror: 'We were absolutely staggered when the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign called us to say Jack had been in touch about meeting Archie. We have had to keep the secret for weeks! 

'Meeting Jack was absolutely amazing. He spent hours with the boys, in the garden, on the computer and chatting away. 

'It is every child's dream come true to come home from school one day and see their hero standing in the hallway. Archie kept thinking it was a dream and the smile on his face is something that we will always treasure.'
