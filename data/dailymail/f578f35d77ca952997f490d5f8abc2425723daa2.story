Brendan Rodgers heaped praise on Raheem Sterling after the wonderkid powered ‘lucky’ Liverpool to a dramatic 3-2 win at QPR.

Sterling — who has been at the centre of controversy after complaining of tiredness ahead of England’s win over Estonia — had a hand in all of Liverpool goals, with Steven Caulker’s own goal in the dying seconds securing three points for the visitors.

Rodgers said: ‘He (Sterling) was outstanding. (He showed) his brightness for the first goal. The breakaways for the other two are all about his speed, his technique, his courage to run with the ball.’

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers heaped praise on his team, but admitted they were fortunate

Roy Hodgson was at Loftus Road on Sunday, but Rodgers said that he did not speak to him. Hodgson insisted, however, that there is no issue between himself and the Liverpool boss.

‘There’s no problem with Brendan. There’s no problem with the player (Sterling),’ said Hodgson. ‘There’s no meeting planned with Brendan. I’ve left messages for him.’

Sterling’s match-winning performance helped overshadow an uncomfortable defensive display from Rodgers’ side ahead of their Champions League clash with Real Madrid on Wednesday.

Liverpool took the lead through Richard Dunne’s 10th Premier League own goal before a manic last eight minutes. Eduardo Vargas levelled for QPR, then Coutinho put the Reds back in front. Vargas equalised for a second time but Caulker’s nightmare finale handed Liverpool the win. ‘I thought we were fortunate,’ admitted Rodgers. ‘We have to let it go, we will learn from it, analyse the game and look back on it.

‘But Real Madrid are playing as well as they have played for the last five to 10 years. The quality they have... and they are the reigning champions.

‘So I really look forward to that and I know the players won’t be overly happy with how they played. But the character and attitude of the team, I don’t think anyone can question that.

‘We have got our three points and we will look to improve.’

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard also said that Liverpool were very lucky to come away with three points

His captain Steven Gerrard agreed, saying: ‘We would have had no complaints if we came away with nothing, we would have no complaints if we came away with a point.

‘I think we’re very lucky to come away with three points.’

Meanwhile Rodgers, despite admitting he can’t replace Luis Suarez, has backed misfiring striker Mario Balotelli to find his form after another frustrating afternoon.But the Liverpool manager added: ‘It’ll drop for the boy, the most important thing for me is his work rate. The guy is doing his best and working really hard.

‘He is seen as the direct replacement for Luis. And as I said before, Luis is irreplaceable. A real world-class talent and that is not what is being asked of Mario.

‘He has come in and wants to improve. It is not going to happen overnight.’
