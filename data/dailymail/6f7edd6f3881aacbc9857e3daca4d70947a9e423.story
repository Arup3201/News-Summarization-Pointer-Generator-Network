Social media users have sprung the owner of a car that was involved in a hit-and-run after he put the vehicle responsible for the accident up for sale online.

Footage of a black Ford Maverick hitting a small Nissan at a set of traffic lights at Sunshine in Victoria emerged on Dash Cam Owners Australia last week.

As the driver of the damaged car began to emerge from his vehicle, the four-wheel drive was seen slowly reversing before mounting the curb and fleeing the scene.

A large dent could clearly be seen in the back of the Nissan, as the shocked owner surveyed the damage to his car.

Just over a week after hundreds of viewers shared their sympathy with the hit-and-run victim, Dash Cam Owners Australia brought their attention to a Gumtree ad for a second-hand black Ford Maverick.

'Remember this clip from Last week? Well here [is] an interesting development,' the Facebook post, which linked to the ad, read.

Social media users= found an for what they claimed to be the car on Gumtree just over one week later 

Dash Cam Owners Australia shared a link to the Gumtree ad online. It received almost 1000 'likes' in four hours

The ad was posted by a seller who also shared his mobile phone number, and read: 'drives really good and reliable does what a shorty does'.

Social media users instantly began drawing comparisons to the advertised car and the one which appeared in the dash cam footage, claiming the number plates and a sticker on the back of the vehicle matched.

The post was 'liked' by almost 1000 people within four hours of being shared, with many sharing text messages they had forwarded to the advertiser.

They also shared text messages that they had forwarded to the advertiser, some of which were 'liked' almost 500 times

'Hi. Does the 4x4 bounce well off small cars and can it make a quick getaway?' one person's text, which received almost 500 'likes' on Facebook, read.

'Got another pic for your Gumtree ad!!' another messaged, including a screenshot from the dash cam footage that showed the car fleeing the accident.

The ad has since been removed from Gumtree. Daily Mail Australia has tried to contact the advertiser for comment, however the number had been disconnected.
