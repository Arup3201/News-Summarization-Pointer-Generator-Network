A third glitch for one of Boeing's new Dreamliner jets in as many days has heightened concerns about the safety of the aircraft.

The 698 model, operated by Japan's All Nippon Airways (ANA), was due to fly to Tokyo's Haneda airport today but never left the ground.

A spokesman at Yamaguchi Ube airport in western Japan said the domestic flight was cancelled because of a problem with the aircraft's brake system.

Scrutiny: Concerns about the safety of the new Boeing Dreamliner aircraft have been raised after three faults in as many days

'In the cockpit, an error message related to its brake system was displayed,' an ANA spokeswoman said.

'The exact nature and the cause of the error message is not clear yet,' she said.

The 98 passengers were switched to another flight for Haneda.

Yesterday, a fuel leak forced a 787 operated by Japan Airlines 
to cancel takeoff at Boston's Logan International Airport.

The day before, another 787 which had arrived caught fire after dropping off 183 passengers and crew from Tokyo at Boston.

Step forward: The Dreamliner, made 50 per cent from composite materials, was hailed as Boeing's bright new hope (file picture)

The Dreamliner, hailed by Boeing as a step forward in aviation travel, has been besieged by problems from the outset.

It was delivered three years later than originally planned and cost a reported £32billion to develop.

It is the first large-scale commercial aircraft made 50 per cent from 'composite materials' including plastics and carbon fibre and experts believe it could bring an end to the 'aluminium age'.

But the series of mishaps has seen Boeing's share price fall significantly in the past few days.

They fell nearly 2.7 per cent yesterday, following a 2 per cent drop on Monday - wiping around $2.8 
billion off its market value, or more than a dozen Dreamliners at their list 
price of $207million.

'We're getting to a tipping point 
where they go from needing to rectify problems to doing major damage 
control to the image of the company and the plane,' said Richard 
Aboulafia, a defense and aerospace analyst with Teal Group, a consulting
firm based in Fairfax, Virginia.

'While
they delivered a large and unexpected number of 787s last year, it's 
possible that they should have instead focused on identifying glitches 
and flaws, rather than pushing ahead with volume production,' he said.

But the company's Asian customers rallied behind the US manufacturer, saying the incidents were glitches that can happen on new planes and confirming they had no plans to scale back or cancel orders for the aircraf.Japan is by far the biggest customer for the Dreamliner to date, with JAL and All Nippon Airways (ANA) operating a total of 24 of the 49 new planes delivered to end-December.

JAL spokesman Kazunori Kidosaki said the carrier, which operates seven Dreamliners, had no plans to change orders it has placed for another 38 aircraft. ANA, which has 17 Dreamliners flying its colors, said it was sticking with its orders for another 49 of the planes, spokesman Etsuya Uchiyama said.

State-owned Air India, which on Monday took delivery of the sixth of the 27 Dreamliners it has ordered, said precautionary measures were already in place and its planes were flying smoothly.

'It's a new plane and some minor glitches do happen. It's not a cause of concern,' said spokesman G.Prasada Rao.

Other carriers already flying the Dreamliner are Ethiopian Airlines, Qatar Airways, LAN Airlines, LOT Polish Airlines, United Airlines and British Airways.
