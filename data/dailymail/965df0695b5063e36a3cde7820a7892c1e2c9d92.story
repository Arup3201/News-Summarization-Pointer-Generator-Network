Mothers exposed to low levels of lead are more likely to have obese children – and baby boys are the most affected, according to a new study.

The effects of lead pollution on the brain and nervous system are already well known.

And now researchers at the University of Michigan have found the first link between the metal and weight gain in future generations.

Mothers exposed to low levels of lead are more likely to have obese children - and boys are the most affected

There is no safe level of lead for human health, doctors warned last month.

Experts are now moving to lower the blood lead level thresholds previously considered safe, in response to international health authorities debating the health effects of low level lead exposure.

A report by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in Australia recommended that blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per decilitre be the indicator used to determine unusual exposure to lead.

In 2009, the NHMRC suggested a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per decilitre or higher warranted investigation.

The report said that as it was not possible to tell whether low level exposure had meaningful adverse health effects, there is no level that should be considered safe.

In an experiment, female mice were exposed to low doses of lead and their offspring were examined and found to have put on weight. Male mice saw an eight to 10 per cent increase in weight.

‘The data supports the obesogen hypothesis that toxicant exposures in the womb contribute to the higher rate of obesity,’ said Dana Dolinoy, Assistant Professor of Environmental Health Sciences at the university.

‘There are certain chemicals that are considered the hallmarks of the obesity epidemic and lead has not been one of them.’

Research Fellow Christopher Faulk added: ‘To see that the level I and others have considered very low has such statistical significance in this study is alarming.

‘There is no minimum safe level for lead. Our research really supports this.’

Lead was once common in paints and petrol until it was banned, but still exists in older homes and in air, water, soil, food and some consumer products.

Baby boomers and older adults were once exposed to lead at much higher levels of exposure than today, which are closer to the lower dosage examined in the study.

Previous research has shown that lead exposure decreases foetal and early childhood growth in human infants and causes obesity in later life.

The new study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, looked at how what a mother ingests, even before pregnancy, impacts her offspring. Experts believe at exposure to chemicals is most serious at conception.

In the experiment, female mice were given drinking water that was contaminated with lead two weeks before mating, as well as throughout pregnancy and nursing.

Their litters were measured at three, six and nine months for energy expenditure, spontaneous activity, food intake and body weight. At nine months they were tested for glucose tolerance.

The groups of mice were exposed to lead at 2.1 parts per million (ppm), 16ppm or 32ppm, alongside another group that had no exposure to lead.

The study found that from birth, male mice in the two highest exposure groups outweighed the controls going into adulthood and an increase in body fat at all dosages showed up in males at three months.

Both sexes exposed to the highest dose ate more than the control group, with males eating more at six months and female food consumption increasing at 9 months.

Exposed males showed impaired insulin levels at 9 months and both sexes showed the expected decline in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production as they aged.

The female mice exposed to lead had higher energy expenditure at three months and the exposed males had lower energy expenditure at nine months.
