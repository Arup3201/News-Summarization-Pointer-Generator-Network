Great Britain's homes have rocketed in value by more than £1.4trillion in the last decade - despite some areas still falling into negative equity.

New data, which has collated the overall worth of properties in England, Wales and Scotland, has revealed that the collective value of British homes has soared to £5.752trillion - with London seeing the greatest rise.

The increase in value, spurred by the 2006 and 2007 housing boom and the more recently, the economic recovery, has not affected the whole of the UK though - as some areas including Durham and Stoke-on-Trent have experienced a sharp drop.

The majority of growth has taken place in London, where the collective worth of homes has doubled in ten years - rising by £441billion, according to research conducted by Savills.

Analysts took prices and the density of homes into account to put the data together.

In stark contrast to the capital, parts of the North East have seen a sharp decline in house prices. 

Homes in County Durham have fallen by £2.4billion over the decade, while Middlesbrough has experienced a drop of £0.2billion.

Several areas in Wales have also fallen in collective house price value including Newport, where there was a £0.2billion drop, and Blaenau Gwent, where prices fell by £0.4billion.

The South East was one of the areas most affected by the national rise - experiencing 19 per cent of of the overall growth, amounting to £270billion.

Excluding London, the highest ranking areas are dominated by those surrounding the capital, namely Epsom and Ewell in Surrey and Reigate and Banstead in East Surrey.

This has been put down to commuters cashing in on London prices and selling up to move to the home counties, where they can live while still working in the capital.

Experiencing boom: Hackney in North East London, pictured above, has seen a considerable rise in prices

Not far behind: The London borough of Hackney has also seen a boom, with collective prices rising by £22.8billion in the decade to 2014

The total value in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and Humber has only risen by £42bn - amounting to just 3 per cent of overall growth in Great Britain.

The growth in the total house value in London and the South East has been 12 times that of the Midlands and the North.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Nigel Wilcock, regional development director at Mickledore, said: 'Economic growth has been in the larger cities, and those areas with a high proportion of public sector jobs have had a tough time.

Decline in value: A street in Blackpool,  where collective house value fell from 2004 to 2014

Slump: Blackpool in the North West of England has seen collective house worth drop by £1.7billion 

The North East is a relatively small economy with a high reliance on the public sector. 

'Therefore, while there are some individual success stories (the Nissan plant in Sunderland) the underlying trend has been relatively gloomy – depressing house prices.' 

In Scotland, the total housing stock in Edinburgh has leaped 33.8 per cent to £11.5billion, while Aberdeenshire, aided by the oil industry revenues, grew 58.2 per cent to £7bn over the decade to 2014.

Hefty decline: County Durham has experienced a severe fall of £2.4billion in collective house value
