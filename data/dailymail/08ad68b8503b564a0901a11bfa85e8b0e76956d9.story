The billionaire Google chairman has been hunting for a new luxury London home that would leave him with a higher UK tax bill than the internet giant has paid out on average in recent years.

Eric Schmidt has hired a friend of Prince William to help him search for a new mansion in the sought-after neighbourhoods of Chelsea or Holland Park.

Due to the spiralling cost of homes in the prestigious postcodes it is estimated that stamp duty would cost him £2.1million, less than the average yearly amount paid by Google in corporation tax between 2006 and 2011.

According to regulatory findings, over that period Google generated £12billion in UK revenues and paid just £10.6million in corporation tax, leading to the company facing heavy criticism for its tax policies, including from Labour leader Ed Miliband and MP Margaret Hodge, who labelled the company's tax ploys as "brazen".

Last year, Google paid £7.3million in corporation tax on sales of £3billion, although tax experts have claimed the figure should have been at least £200million higher.

Mr Schmidt, said to be searching for a family-sized home, has been viewing properties valued at around £30million, according to newspaper the Financial Times.

He is said to have hired Thomas Van Straubenzee, a friend of Prince William and a partner in estate agent firm VanHan.

Mr Van Staubenzee is believed to be on his honeymoon, following his lavish wedding to Lady Melissa Percy, the daughter of the Duke of Northumberland in a ceremony attended by a host of Royals including William and Harry, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Pippa Middleton and Harry's rumoured new
girlfriend Cressida Bonas were also present, while the Prince's ex 
Chelsea Davy was a bridesmaid.

Mr Van Straubenzee was unavailable for comment, while a Google spokesman declined to issue a statement on the claims.

Due to the Government increasing stamp duty on homes worth more than £2m to seven per cent this would mean that a £2.1m fee would be owed on a £30m home.

One estate agent with awareness of the house hunt said that Mr Schmidt's only criteria for his new home is that it "doesn't require any work."

His decision to look for a London home follows building work getting underway on Google's new London headquarters in Kings Cross.
