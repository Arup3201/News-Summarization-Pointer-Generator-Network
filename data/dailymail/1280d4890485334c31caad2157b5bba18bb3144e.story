The Australian Defence Force is facing claims that one of their leading battalions paid topless barmaids to entertain soldiers and junior officers at an 'Oktoberfest' event, resulting in the demotion of a corporal.

It is alleged that four civilian women were paid to remove their clothes, despite direct orders being handed down from the commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment to avoid such behaviour, The Australian reports.

The battalion, currently based at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, Queensland, was first formed in 1945 and has deployed to significant Australian engagements including the occupation of Japan, the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.

The 'Oktoberfest' event was held for over 100 soldiers and junior officers from the 2nd Battalion on September 26, during which a roast pig and $6000 worth of alcohol was served at a venue known as 'The Booza'.

A status posted the day after the event on the Battalion's Facebook page '2 RAR Pipes and Drums', said 'The Pig carcass destroyed. Two cartons left out of the 6G we spent on booze. One fat lip. One possible demotion. BUT ONE HELL OF A NIGHT!'.

One of the members of the page commented 'You wouldn't have it any other way'.  

The event was held at 'The Booza', Edgar Towner Victoria Cross Club at the battalion's Lavarack Barracks, where only serving members of the rank of Corporal or below are permitted.

The Australian reported that the battalion advertised for 'bar girls' for the event, but there was no indication that the women would be asked to remove their clothes.

A military spokesman said that specific instructions were given for the women to be fully clothed throughout the event.

'In this instance, and prior to the function, both written and verbal orders were given directing that bar staff were to assist in the service of food and beverages only and were to remain fully clothed at all times,' the spokesman said. 

The women were allegedly freelance workers recommended by a member of the battalion, and not from Townsville's major hostess companies.

The Facebook page has a picture of a nearly naked woman removing her underwear with the caption, 'Oh you're an infantryman? Guess I won't be needing these anymore.'

One member of the battalion commented, 'I'm sure my old Tp SGT did this a few times.'

Other comments include, 'Ah the memories' and 'Stay classy Townsville'. 

The incident was reported to the battalion's senior commanding officer after the event.

The corporal responsible for organising the event was allegedly found to have breached direct orders by the commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Michael Bassingthwaighte and stripped of his rank and sentenced to 14 days detention, reported The Australian.

Upon release the corporal lodged a petition against the demotion, and a review into the incident ruled that the Lieutenant could not objectively pass judgement on a charge of flouting his own orders.

The corporal was reinstated and the sentence brought against him was removed.

'The issues regarding the legal advice provided...are now a matter from training and professional development,' said the military spokesman.

The ADF has been plagued with a spate of sexual scandals in recent years

The ADF has been plagued with a spate of sexual scandals in recent years, including the release of pictures showing soldiers from the Special Air Service Regiment barracks in Swanbourne, Western Australia in the company of topless barmaids employed by a government-owned bar.  

Defence banned the barmaids from attending the Gratwick Club which is located next to the Special Air Service Regiment barracks in Swanbourne, Western Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The photos, which appeared on ninemsn, show soldiers in the company of topless women, one of whom is tattooed and blonde. 

Another photo shows a brunette woman with pink nail polish holding up a peace sign in the foreground of a photo, with uniformed soldiers pictured sitting at tables in the background.

The mother of a former special forces soldier, who uncovered the photos, claims her son has been mistreated over his sexuality.  

Recently ABC TV's Four Corners program aired fresh stories from four former female cadets who claim to have been raped, sexually assaulted or denigrated while at ADFA in the 1990s and 2009.

The women criticised the military's response to abuse claims - the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce - as inadequate. 

They have also been joined by former Australian Defence Force magistrate Ken Northwood, Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie and lawyer Gary Rumble - who led a review into ADFA abuse allegations - in calling for a royal commission to fully uncover the extent of abuse and hold the perpetrators to account.

The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce is still responding to claims.
