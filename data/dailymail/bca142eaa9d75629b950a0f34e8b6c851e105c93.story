Radical changes to pay and conditions for police have been announced in a bid to cut costs

Police reacted with anger yesterday after their starting salary was slashed to below that of a trainee manager at McDonald's.

Theresa May backed a package of controversial reforms which will see new recruits earn a minimum of £19,000-a-year – a cut of £4,000.

The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said the cut was 'ill-conceived and fails to reflect the dangers and demands inherent in the job'.

There was also widespread anger on social media sites used by officers. One wrote on Twitter: 'McDonalds starting salary £21.5k…'

The Home Secretary's decision is based on an overhaul of police pay and conditions proposed by the ex-rail regulator Tom Winsor. The ideas were then considered by the Police Arbitration Tribunal last year.

Mrs May said she accepted the tribunal's recommendation that the salary for recruits with no experience, such as school-leavers, should be cut by 17 per cent, to £19,000.

Older recruits with relevant experience, such as a period as a special constable, will earn £22,000 a year. New recruits in London will earn a minimum of £21,000, which could rise to £25,500, if they live in an expensive part of the capital.

Controversially, if officers work for the Met, but travel in from counties such as Hertfordshire or Cambridgeshire, they may not receive the full entitlement of 'London weighting' for the first time.

The final decision, which could mean two PCs doing the same job earning different sums, will rest with the Met.

Mrs May also accepted plans to introduce a national on-call allowance of £15 for each daily session that rank-and-file officers are on-call on days off from April 2013.

The cuts will mean new recruits will start on a salary of £19,000 - a drop of £4,000

But
competence-related threshold payments – a bonus available to those who 
are at the top of the pay scale and can demonstrate they are strong 
performers – will be phased out over the next three years. These 
'grab-a-grand' payments were worth up to £1,200-a-year.

Home Secretary Theresa May insisted the government's police and crime reforms were 'working'

Plans
to allow police forces to sack under-performing officers remain on 
hold. A decision will be taken later this year, after further 
negotiations.

Recruits will earn less than newly 
qualified teachers, who are paid £21,588 outside London, and nurses, who
get £21,176 outside the capital – although most of these have a degree.

In London, comparisons were drawn 
between the maximum of £25,500 paid to a newly-qualified officer, and 
the £45,000 paid to a driver starting work on the London Underground.

Several officers pointed to the 
difference between the police service and McDonald's, which pays a 
trainee manager between £18,500 and £21,500.

In a statement, Mrs May said the 
reforms were part of a programme to 'modernise police pay and 
conditions, so that they are fair to both officers and the taxpayer'.

She added: 'The Government's reform programme is working – crime is 
falling and public confidence is high.'

Steve Williams, national chairman of 
the Police Federation, said it was 'disappointed' by some of the 
recommendations of the Police Arbitration Tribunal, but accepted that 
Mrs May's decision was binding on the federation.

But Ian Hanson, chairman of the 
federation's Greater Manchester branch, said: 'We are now in the 
ridiculous situation whereby police community support officers are paid 
more than police officers starting in the job.'
