A three-year-old girl has been unveiled as the one of the youngest ever members of high IQ society Mensa.

Alice Amos scored an incredible 162 in an IQ test - matching some of the world's most notable intellectuals, both past and present.

The toddler, from Guildford, Surrey, is already bilingual, speaking both English and Russian, where her parents are from.

Intellectual: The toddler, pictured with her Mensa certificate, scored an impressive 162 on the Stanford Binet test, matching some of the world's most notable intellectuals

Alice's advanced intellect means she is one of the 'top one per cent', with an IQ eight points higher than Carol Vorderman.

Her score also matches that of Professor Stephen Hawking, who has never officially revealed his IQ, but which is gauged to be between 160 and 165.

The three-year-old's score means she is only one of 18 pre-school members of the society.

She already spends her spare time reading Aesop's fables and other fairytales, also enjoying singing, dancing, painting, crafts and reading.

CEO of British Mensa, John Stevenage, said: 'We are delighted that Alice has joined the society.

'At Mensa we aim to provide a 
positive environment for gifted children as they develop and hope they 
will benefit from interaction with other bright children.'

Alice was admitted to Mensa after her parents submitted a 
report by British psychologist Professor Joan Freeman.

She scored 162 on the Stanford Binet test - an IQ quiz that looks to measure five factors of cognitive ability.

These are fluid reasoning, knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, and working memory.

The youngster, who attends Rydeshill Preparatory School in Guildford, works to an advance level in both literacy and numeracy.

Her IQ of 162 ranks her higher than a list of the world's greatest luminaries. Former US presidents Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin and Bill Clinton could only muster 128, 160 and 137 respectively.

Napoleon Bonaparte scored 145 and Sigmund Freud was still left trailing in the wake of Alice with a score of 156.

There are currently more than 1,000 members of Mensa aged under 18.

Children under the age of 
10-and-a-half can join Mensa by submitting prior evidence of their IQ 
score being in the top two per cent.

Adults and children over the age of 10-and-a-half, take the Mensa Supervised IQ Test.

The youngest person to ever join British Mensa was Elise Tan Roberts in 2009 aged 2 years and four months.
