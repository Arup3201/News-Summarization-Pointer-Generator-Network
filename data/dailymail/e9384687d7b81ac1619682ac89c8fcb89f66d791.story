On trial: Sylvia Cooper, 45, pictured arriving at Warwick Crown Court, is accused of a string of sexual assaults

A lesbian police community support 
officer sexually assaulted five colleagues, fondling one woman’s breasts
and groping a male officer in his patrol car, a court heard yesterday.

Sylvia Cooper, 45, subjected officers 
of both genders to a string of unwanted sexual advances, persistently 
touching their genitals and slapping their bottoms, it is alleged.

On one occasion, she reached under a 
WPC’s skirt from behind, while on another she grabbed a male officer 
while he was wearing cycling shorts and complimented him on his ‘nice 
package’, the  court heard.

Cooper is said to have treated the 
assaults ‘as a joke’ but officers were so uncomfortable they switched 
shifts to avoid contact with her.

One female colleague requested a transfer because she was scared Cooper would touch her in the police station’s changing rooms.

Cooper appeared in court yesterday 
accused of eight sexual assaults against colleagues at West Midlands 
Police when she worked as a PCSO in 2009 and 2010. She has been 
suspended from the force.

Glyn Samuel, prosecuting, described a 
series of examples of Cooper’s ‘inappropriate’ behaviour, including one 
time when she asked a female colleague for sex.

He told the court: ‘The behaviour complained of is persistent non-consensual touching.

‘It includes the groping or slapping 
of bottoms, the groping or grabbing of breasts and even grabbing the 
groin area of male officers.

‘All of this has had a significant effect, particularly in one case, on the people making the complaint.

‘People just did not want to work with Sylvia Cooper.

‘They did not want to be near her because they did not know what she was going to do with them.’

It is alleged that Cooper slapped and touched one female community support officer’s bottom more than once a week.

On one occasion, she asked her: ‘Do you fancy a ****?’

The officer was so traumatised by the 
assaults she had to seek medical help and eventually requested to be 
transferred from the force, Warwick Crown Court heard.

Speaking yesterday from behind a 
protective screen, she said: ‘On several occasions she [Cooper] would 
rub my knees with her hand and there has been occasions when she would 
slap me with the palm of her hand on my bottom. It could be a few rubs, 
possibly about once a week at least.’

The female PCSO said this would happen
both in the office in front of other police officers and when they were
out on foot patrol.

In 2010, she then allegedly saw Cooper rub a male colleague’s leg as he was driving a police car.

‘My locker is in the same room as 
Sylvia’s and after that I didn’t want to get changed in front of her so I
almost ran down to my locker and got changed out of my uniform into my 
clothes,’ she added.

‘Once I was changed she came into the 
locker room. She saw that I had got changed into my own clothes and said
to me, “I can’t believe I’ve missed you with your clothes off”.’

Unwelcome attention: Warwick Crown Court, right, heard Cooper, left, had such a lecherous reputation colleagues deliberately changed their shifts to avoid coming into contact with her

The court also heard evidence from a male officer who claims he had his buttocks and groin groped by Cooper.

He told the jury: ‘I got changed to 
work in my cycle uniform and was in the report-writing room. Sylvia was 
on my right on the computer. Next thing I knew there was a grope between
my legs and Sylvia said, “Nice package”. I was shocked and 
embarrassed.’

The court also heard that Cooper told a colleague that she
and her female partner had tattoos ‘in an intimate place’.

Cooper, who was recommended for a 
Women in Policing Award  during her service, denies the allegations, 
claiming she only pointed at the male officer’s ‘package’.

Defence lawyer Martin Steen said: ‘If 
there was any touching, it wasn’t regarded as sexual assault by the 
victim.’

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
