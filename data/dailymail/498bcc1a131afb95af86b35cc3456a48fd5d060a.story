Lonely cancer patients are more likely to struggle with their treatment plans, putting their lives at risk, a charity claims.

Patients without a supportive network of friends and family around them are three times more likely to fall behind with their treatment than those who aren’t lonely, according to a new study.

Many patients are missing appointments, not taking their medication properly, are unable to pick up prescriptions or even refusing treatment, Macmillan Cancer Support said.

Among cancer patients who are lonely in the UK:

Its poll of more than 1,000 people from across the UK who had ever been diagnosed with cancer, found that one in five have been lonely since their diagnosis.

Almost a third of those who said they had been lonely said they faced at least one issue with their treatment plan compared with 11 per cent who had not felt alone.

Jacqui Graves, head of health and social care at Macmillan Cancer Support said: ‘Lonely cancer patients may not have the practical support they need to get out of the house and attend their appointments, or pick up prescriptions, especially if they can’t drive or live in a remote area.

‘Or they may feel emotionally overwhelmed and too anxious to attend appointments or have treatment. We know patients who have only attended appointments because friends or family persuaded them.’

Some 20,000 lonely cancer patients in the UK are having difficulty with their treatment, the charity said.

Mabel Macartney, 61, from Cheshire, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 said:

'None of my family or friends live near me, so although I could stay with a friend after surgery, when I was told I’d need six months of chemotherapy the only thing going through my mind was: "How am I going to cope?"

'I couldn’t ask anyone to stay with me for such a long time or afford to be off work with no one else to help pay the mortgage. So I turned the chemotherapy treatment down.  

'It was a horrible situation to be in, alone with life-changing decisions to make and I know I risked the chance of the cancer returning.'

One in 30 people are estimated to have skipped treatment appointments and one in 17 didn’t take medicine as they should.

One in eight patients couldn’t pick up prescriptions, while one in 11 refused some type of treatment.

A total of five per cent of cancer patients refused treatment all together.

Ciaran Devane, Chief Executive of the charity, said: ‘We already know that loneliness may be as harmful as smoking but this research shows for the first time that it is particularly toxic to cancer patients.

‘It is simply unacceptable that so many cancer patients feel emotionally alone or lack practical support to such an extent that they are missing appointments, unable to take their medicine or even refusing treatment, and that it’s putting their recovery at risk.

‘With Britain currently the loneliness capital of Europe and the cancer population set to double to four million by 2030, the problem’s only going to get worse. We need to urgently tackle it now.

‘That’s why we’re calling on health professionals to identify lonely cancer patients and make them aware of the support available so that they don’t have to go through their cancer alone.’
