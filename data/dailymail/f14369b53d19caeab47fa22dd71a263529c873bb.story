Russia’s tough-talking foreign minister was accused of a major error today after he claimed American members of Congress are so uninterested in the world that 80 percent of them have never traveled abroad.

Sergei Lavrov’s claim was analyzed by the Washington Post's fact-checking body, and it concluded that 84 percent of lawmakers had traveled outside the U.S. on business since 2000.  

In contrast to the United States, more than a dozen of Russia's top politicians have been banned from making trips abroad because of sanctions brought in to punish its hardline President Vladimir Putin’s annexation of the Crimea.  

Russia's minister of foreign affairs, Sergei Lavrov, claimed on Wednesday that 80 percent of U.S. lawmakers had never left America, and that is why they have 'Russophobia.' A fact-checker quickly discredited the slam

The Russian official's harsh words toward U.S. legislators was precipitated by the possibility of new sanctions on the country meant to bring about economic downturn and to encourage it to cease military operations in Ukraine.

Russia's top diplomat framed proposed new U.S. sanctions on his country as the work of American lawmakers with an uneducated world view.

'Congress is a very special group of people, more than 80 percent of them never left the United States, they live in their own world, so I’m not amazed about this Russophobia which is being demonstrated by the Congress at the moment,'  Lavrov told a French television channel on Wednesday.

Ironically, leading American legislators wouldn't be able to visit Russia even if they wanted to as the country has put them on a blacklist in response to travel bans on its own politicians.  

The Russian official had fuller faith in U.S. President Barack Obama, however, and speculated that the world leader wouldn't enact new restrictions on the country. 

The White House on Thursday said that while Obama would sign a bill allowing for more restrictions on trade with Russia when the bill arrives on his desk this week, he does not intend to introduce new sanctions at this time.

In recent days the value of the Russian rouble has  fallen sharply, as have oil prices in the country, forcing Russia's Central Bank into panic mode. In the wee hours of Tuesday morning it suddenly announced an interest rate increase as a last-ditch effort to stabilize the country's currency.

Earlier this week, the spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Josh Earnest, told reporters, 'The fact of the matter is [Russian President] Vladimir Putin actually is the person in the world with the most consequential role to play in trying to reverse this trend.

'If merely he will live up to the kinds of commitments that he’s already made...you could see the international community start to relax these sanctions in a way that would relieve the pressure on the people of Russia and on the Russian economy,' he said.

'And that would be good for the world,' he added. ''It would send a very clear signal that respecting these basic international norms is important, and it would also allow President Putin to demonstrate to his people that he’s actually concerned about their well being and the well being of their economy.'

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, right, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, left, share a laugh during their meeting, at Villa Taverna, on Sunday in Rome. Kerry and Lavrov discussed the ongoing Middle East peace process, and rising tensions in Ukraine. The White House said today that it would not put additional sanctions on Russia at this time but it would sign legislation giving it the option to in the future

Lavrov denied to France 24 in an interview on Wednesday that the sanctions already in place on his country are causing an 'economic meltdown.'

'Of course it hurts, we don’t take any pleasure from sanctions,' he said, according to a translation of his remarks posted to his ministry's website. 

'But it’s not our problem. It’s the problem of the European Union and the United States and other countries,' he claimed.

Lavrov pointed the finger of blame at the U.S. for convincing its allies to punish Russia and denigrated European countries as cowardly for playing follow the leader.

'Frankly, it’s really a pity that we for some previous years overestimated the independence of the European Union and even big European countries.' he said.

Continuing, he said 'some people believe that sanctions are a sign of weakness or a sign of irritation, which is not the best quality of a politician, but I can assure you that Russia will not only survive, but will come out stronger out of this.

'We have been in much worse situations in our history, and every time we were getting out of these fixes much stronger. This will happen this time,' he asserted.

Turning his ire to U.S. lawmakers, Lavrov insulted their intelligence and suggested that Obama wouldn't place new sanctions on Russia, even if he did sign legislation giving him the authority to do so.

'The bill is not automatic. It provides for some specific things, I believe, to be done automatically, but it also provides for something to be left to the president’s discretion,' he said.

'So we’ll see how it works,' he said while declining whether to say whether Russia would consider additional restrictions an act of war.
