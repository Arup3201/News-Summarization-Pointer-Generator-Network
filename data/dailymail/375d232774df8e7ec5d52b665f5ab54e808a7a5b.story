Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe was said to be close to death tonight.

The 88-year-old, who is believed to be suffering from prostate cancer, flew to Singapore by private jet on Saturday for treatment.

His wife, Grace, and close family members are reported to be at his bedside.

Vigil: Robert Mugabe's family are with him as the Zimbabwean leader, who is said to be close to death, battles cancer in a Singapore hospital

The tyrant has undergone several bouts of therapy in Asia in recent years.

But his condition has now 
deteriorated and there were claims tonight that he has agreed to hand 
over power to his feared henchman and defence minister, Emmerson 
Mnangagwa.

Rumours over Mugabe’s health have 
been rife in recent weeks because of his frail appearance. There was 
heightened speculation today when the Zimbabwe government postponed a 
cabinet meeting at the last minute.

The Zimbabwe Mail, quoting a senior 
official of Mugabe’s ZANU-PF party, said the leader, who has ruled the 
country since its independence from Britain in 1980, was undergoing 
intensive treatment in Asia.

Mugabe was  supposedly in Singapore to oversee his daughter Bona’s enrolment at university.

But registration does not start until
 September and opponents said it was unlikely he would travel abroad to 
deal with such a matter in person.

Sources in Iran, which has a warm relationship with Zimbabwe, said Mugabe had agreed on his successor.

The Tehran Times said the tyrant had 
entered into a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ to hand over power to 65-year-old
 Mnangagwa, who helped orchestrate the violent opposition to Britain in 
the 1970s.

The former Zimbabwe intelligence 
chief was also widely blamed for the brutality following the 2008 
presidential election after Mugabe’s rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, took an 
early lead in the voting.

He is also thought to have played a 
major role in the crackdown of the opposition Zapu party in the 1980s 
that left thousands of civilians dead.

There was no comment on Mugabe’s 
health tonight from either his family or from the Zimbabwe 
government.Mugabe’s aides have denied there is a medical emergency, 
claiming he is enjoying an Easter break in Asia with his family.

But Zimbabwe’s vice president, Joice 
Mujuru, has reportedly cut short her trip to Asia to return home and 
prepare for the possibility of Mugabe’s death.

The tyrant is understood to have 
travelled to Singapore eight times last year for medical treatment. A 
diplomatic cable released last year by Wikileaks said Mugabe was 
diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008 and given five years to live 
because it had spread.

He is said to have defied pleas from his own doctors to step down.

Taking over? It's been reported that Mugabe entered into a 'gentleman's agreement' to hand over power to Emmerson Mnangagwa

His ailing health has been cited as 
the main reason that a hard line faction of his ZANU-PF party has pushed
 to rush through new elections.

The Zimbabwe Mail quoted a 
British-based Zimbabwe analyst, who wished to remain anonymous, as 
saying: ‘Mugabe’s health impacts entirely on Zimbabwe’s political 
landscape. Everything revolves around his health and his age.’

In February, Mugabe declared himself 
‘fit as a fiddle’. Last month he celebrated his 88th birthday with a 
lavish party in the capital, Harare, reputed to have cost £650,000.

The leader was said to have feasted on a cake in the shape of a crocodile.

Mugabe was hailed as a hero by many 
Africans when he came to power 32 years ago with Zimbabwe looked on as a
 model for a successful transition from white rule.

But the nation’s fortunes have plunged together with Mugabe’s reputation.

He is now regarded as one of the 
world’s worst human rights abusers. He has been accused of murdering 
thousands of his own citizens and brutally crushing all opposition to 
his rule.

His policies have also been blamed for driving Zimbabwe into bankruptcy. 
Mugabe’s land reforms in particular, leading to violent seizures from 
white farmers, have been harshly criticised by the British and American 
governments.
