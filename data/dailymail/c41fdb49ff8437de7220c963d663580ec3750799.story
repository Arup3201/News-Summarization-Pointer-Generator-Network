If Manchester United fans were wondering what they may be missing from Nani, the answer is the same old feints and flicks... accompanied by an ultimate sense of frustration.

It's fair to say that the Portuguese winger failed to live up to expectations at Old Trafford before agreeing a loan move back to his former club Sporting Lisbon.

He was back in action against Premier League opposition when Chelsea travelled to the Estádio José Alvalade for their Champions League group G clash - with contrasting performances in each half.

0 - 5mins: The 27-year-old started on the wing - where he has spent most of his career at both club and international level playing under the shadow of another Sporting alumni Cristiano Ronaldo - and his first touch involved a typically jinking move that ultimately lacked an end product.

9mins: Nani temporarily switched wings with Andre Carillo, who had been the more impressive going forward on the rare occasion that Sporting managed to break, but struggled to get any time on the ball as Chelsea dominated early proceedings.

18min: As elder statesman, Nani's younger teammates repeatedly tried to search him out in what appeared to be a free role across the front.

His simple pass to Jonathan Silva led to a scoring opportunity wasted by Islam Slimani - but Nani lost possession only moments later and Sporting were fortunate that Andre Schurrle was in another profligate mood.

33mins: Not one renowned for his defensive capabilities, Nani was nowhere to be seen as former Benfica midfielder Nemanja Matic opened the scoring with a solid header from a floated cross by Cesc Fabregas.

37mins: Nani attempted to beat Branislav Ivanovic for pace down the left touchline in a battle re-enacted from his time in England, but the Chelsea defender used his strength to usher the ball out for a goal kick.

41mins: As half-time approached, the closest Nani came to being compared with Ronaldo is petulantly complaining with his hands on his hips when Adrien Silva opted for a shot instead of passing to him.

HT: Manchester United fans will recognise a first-half performance that saw Nani roam freely around the pitch playing subtle passes without actually imposing himself on the game or penetrating the areas that matter.

47mins: Nani took his first shot with a whipped effort from a standing position that raised the commentator's voice before a different angle revealed the ball swerving well wide of Thibaut Courtois' goal.

49mins: In a move that perfectly illustrates why Nani frustrates, he raced down the left wing after taking the ball in his stride with a beautifully deft touch but, once inside Chelsea's penalty area with options available, he decided on a back heel... after confusing the referee for a teammate!

50mins: Sporting definitely looked more dangerous after the interval and Nani saw far more of the ball. Another raid down the left was halted by a shove from Felipe Luis that was seen by everyone except the referee who failed to award a deserved free-kick on the edge of the area.

54mins: Nani missed a superb chance to level the scoring after racing on to a loose ball on the left of the penalty area but his composure deserted him with Courtois racing out and the ball could only find the side netting.

60mins: A nicely placed free-kick was lifted tamely into the wall by Nani before he lost possession from the rebound and almost allowed Chelsea another break away before Diego Costa was cynically brought down.

65mins: Nani tried to switch play with a raking cross field pass to Carillo but it was slightly over hit, allowing Oscar to cover enough ground to intercept.

71mins: Eden Hazard is cautioned for tripping Nani from behind as Sporting continue their second half resurgence.

78mins: Nani conceded a free-kick after tumbling over Willian on the byline in a rare show of tracking back. 

81mins: The Portuguese winger had another shot but could not get enough pace or direction on the ball to trouble Courtois

86mins: In his best effort of the night, Nani cut inside from the right and ghosted past three defenders before unleashing a superb dipping effort that sailed agonisingly over the crossbar.

FT: Sporting and Nani came to life at the beginning of the second half with the winger seeing far more of the ball and dictating more of the play while coming close with a couple of decent efforts.

However, none were on target while his final product still leaves much to be desired - and Manchester United fans won't be losing any sleep after a typical performance coined by inconsistency.
