Always fancied building a boat, but don’t have the carpentry skills? Now you can print one.

That’s exactly what Chinese engineers did in an effort to highlight the potential applications of what they claim to be the world’s biggest 3D printer.

The fully-functioning vessel can seat two adults and was created by Industrial Innovation Design Centre in Sanya in China's Hainan Island.

They have created a huge 3D printer that has the ability to print in multiple materials and in full colour, according to project leader Chen Minqiao.

The printer weighs 30,000lbs (15 tons) and can create objects up to 13.2ft (4 metres) in length with a height and breadth of around 6.6ft (2 metres).

It can print around 4.7 inches (12 cm) in height per hour for hollow objects with a diameter of a little less than a metre.

The plastic 3D boat shown in action is one of the first objects to be turned out by the huge 3D printer in China

In April, Chinese engineers were able to build 10 detached houses within 24 hours, using the modern technology.

The compact houses were constructed using waste material which was pumped out into layers.

And the properties were said to have been created for less than $5,000 (£2,974) each.

Four huge printers measuring 105ft (32 metres) long, 33ft (10 metres) wide and 22ft (6.6 metres) tall were used to make the bungalows.

The new construction technique means affordable housing could be created faster than ever before.

There are even hopes skyscrapers could be erected using the same technology.

China has announced the first 3D printed house project will be located in Qingdao, a major city in Shandong Province.

The plastic 3D boat is one of the first objects to be turned out by the 3D printer. The group has not revealed how much it cost to make.

It measures 6.6ft (two metres) in length, is 2.7ft (0.8 metres wide), and weighs approximately 77lb (35kg).

3D printing involves by building up a 3D object from a computer file using layers of material.

Like a traditional inkjet printer, material, usually plastic, is laid down on a base. Further layers are simply printed on top, gradually revealing a 3D object.

The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. Shoes, jewellery and even dresses have been created, with designs often sold online.

Many believe it could even lead to 'mini factories' for living rooms allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a replacement part for a broken household appliance.
