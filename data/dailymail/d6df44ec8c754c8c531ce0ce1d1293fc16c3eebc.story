Some families go hiking, play board games or get together to watch their favourite TV show – others find less conventional ways to bond.

The Smith family from West Point, Indiana, all share a love for taxidermy and together they have decorated their home with more than 230 mounted and stuffed animals.

Joe, Fonda and their 19-year-old son Tanner are obsessed with hunting and stuffing animals and have spent $400,000 on their trophy collection.

Get stuffed: Joe, Fonda and Tanner Smith have spent $400,000 on their 230-strong collection of hunting trophies - all of which they have killed, stuffed and mounted themselves

The family's 3,800 square ft home boasts a collection of 144 species include a hippo, an elephant, several baboons and a 9ft Russian brown bear - all killed by the Smiths on hunting trips across the world.

Despite the large number of trophies, the family do not consider themselves obsessed.

'It does not seem crazy to us,’ Joe, 61, told the Indystar. ‘It is just our life, and we love it.

'To an onlooker, it may seem so by the volume and variety of mounts we have here.

'The point when it seemed to be a lot to us was when it began to be a challenge to find room to hang a head or anything else in a 1,200-square-foot trophy room.’

Family bonding: Hunting, stuffing and mounting their trophies is a hobby the Smiths all share - and everyone plays their part in the process

Hunting hobby: Joe, 61, taught himself to do taxidermy in the 70s and turned his hobby into a family business to fund hunting trips around the world

Happy hunting: It is down to son Tanner, 19, and Joe to hunt down the animals the Smiths use for trophies

Father to son: After bringing home the prey, Tanner skins the animals before he starts working on the taxidermy process with his father

Perfection: Tanner inspects the horns on an impala shot in Africa, while his mother Fonda finishes off another exotic trophy to add to their $400,000 collection

Joe is a self-taught taxidermist who has hunted, stuffed and mounted over 4,000 animals.

He
 began mounting in the late 70s, teaching himself taxidermy by picking 
up road-kills and experimenting with different methods to be able to 
mount his own hunting trophies.

The hobby has turned into a business and the family taxidermy company help pay for their own trophies.

Joe and son Tanner will normally go out hunting together and bring the trophies home.

Tanner
 then skins the animals, Joe stuffs them and Fonda does the final 
preparations and make sure the animals retain their lifelike looks.

Obsessed: The Smiths have over 230 stuffed and mounted animals in their home in West Point, Indiana

Always watching: The collection boasts 144 different species, all mounted on the walls and filling all available floor space in the family's 3,800 square ft home

Big job: Every single one of the 230 trophies have been caught and killed by the Smith family

Lack of space: During filming for My Crazy Obsession, there is a lion casually drying in the kitchen

Appearing in an episode of TLC's My Crazy Obsession, Fonda, 46, said: 'We love that we can do this together.'

Joe added: 'We are bringing them back to life, we are honouring the animals.'

The next project will be to mount an 11ft giraffe Joe killed in Africa last year.

‘It will then be the tallest member of the mounted family,’ Mr Smith told the Indystar.

Passionate: Joe, 61, pictured in his workshop, does not think the family has a 'crazy obsession'

Pride: The family stands next to the giant of their collection - a 9ft Russian brown bear shot by Joe, soon to be beaten by an 11ft giraffe the family brought back from a hunting trip to Africa

Family fun: The Smiths believe their taxidermy hobby is a way of bringing the dead animals back to life and 'honouring' them by mounting their heads on their walls
