Mr Justice Cobb held a two day hearing at the Court of Protection after health and social services applied to sterilise a mother-of-six against her will

A mother-of-six with severe learning difficulties could be taken into hospital using 'necessary restraint' to sterilise her. 

At a hearing at the Court of Protection, health and social services applied for permission to enter the woman's home and take her to hospital to be sterilised against her will because they said her health would be put at risk if she had more children. 

John McKendrick, who represented a health authority, hospital trust and council - which cannot be identified - said the application was 'extraordinary' and would involve serious interference with the woman's human rights.  

Mr Justice Cobb held a two day hearing into the case and heard that health workers had struggled to get the woman, who cannot be named, to take contraception, the Sun reported. 

Her six children have been taken into care and Mr Justice Cobb said the case was one of 'enormous gravity.' 

The hearing took place at the Court of Protection in London, the UK's most secretive court which deals with cases involving usually highly vulnerable people who lack the mental ability to make decisions for their well being themselves.

The court heard that the woman, who is in her 30s, has medical problems which will pose a significant risk if she has another child. 

Michael Horne, appointed by the court to represent the woman's interests, said: 'The issues have nothing to do with eugenics. 

'It is a "therapeutic" sterilisation in that it most effectively mitigates the grave risks to health and life that a further pregnancy could bring.' 

Mr Justice Cobb ordered that none of the parties could be identified and will give his judgement soon.  

Barristers said the bid at the Court of Protection in London was 'extraordinary' but important for her health
