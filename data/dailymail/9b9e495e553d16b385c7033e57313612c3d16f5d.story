It is the camera used to photograph the Earth from an orbiting space station 40 years before Commander Chris Hadfield captured the world's attention with his pictures from the International Space Station.

A rare Nasa camera used aboard Skylab, the first US Space Station, which orbited the Earth from 1973 to 1979, is set to be auctioned.

The modified Hasselblad 500 EL/M was specially adapted to work in the cramped conditions about Skylab - and be operated while wearing spacesuits.

The modified Hasselblad 500 EL/M was taken to the moon during the NASAs Skylab 3 and Skylab 4 missions in 1973

Skylab was the United States' first space station, and orbited the Earth from 1973 to 1979 in various forms.

It included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems.

Three manned missions to the station, conducted between 1973 and 1974 each delivered a three-astronaut crew.

On the last two manned missions, an additional Apollo / Saturn IB stood by ready to rescue the crew in orbit if it was needed.

The space agency worked with Hasselblad to develop the cameras, known as 'moon cameras', even thought this particular one did not make it to the lunar surface.

The Hasselblad cameras were selected by NASA because of their interchangeable lenses and magazines.

Modifications were made to permit ease of use in cramped conditions while wearing spacesuits, such as the replacement of the reflex mirror with an eye-level finder.

In this model along with other modifications the mirror was removed to reduce weight.

A special large locking mechanism was also added in order to change film magazines with bulky space gloves on.

Similarly a larger, sturdier shutter 
release plate was added to the camera and the special reseau plate with 
matching body number '42' to imprint on taken images.

The camera - which is expected to fetch 50 to 60,000 euros - is set to go under the hammer in Vienna, Austria, on Saturday.

Some of the Hassleblad Cameras images are included ion the auction, showing exactly what it was used for

The same camera model was also taken to the moon - and twelve Hasselblads still remain on the lunar surface. They were left there to allow for the 25kg of lunar rock samples that were brought back instead.
