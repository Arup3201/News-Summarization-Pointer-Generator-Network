Researchers have found that fast food may be less unhealthy
than a bottomless pasta bowl.

Olive Garden, Red Lobster and T.G.I. Friday’s boast a
significant amount of meals that have more calories, saturated fat and sodium
than is recommended and even more than a McDonald's value meal, according to the Drexel University-University of
Pennsylvania study.

The team studied more than 2,600 menu items across the three
chains in an effort to help diners better understand what they are eating, Time
reported.

The healthier choice?: Surprisingly, the answer is yes in many cases

More than half of the items served at the seemingly
healthier options than the Golden Arches were labelled ‘healthy,’ but there was
no uniform standard for making that determination, the study showed.

Research found that meals consisting of a shared appetizer,
adult entrée and side dish averaged 1,495 calories and contained 28 grams of
saturated fat and 3,312 milligrams of sodium, Time noted.

Federal guidelines suggest adults eat about 2,000 calories
per day, children roughly 1,400.

Those suggestions were easily surpassed when including
drinks, the study said.

‘Consumers tend to view full-service restaurants as superior
in quality and healthfulness compared with quick service restaurants,’ the team
wrote. ‘However, a few studies contrasted nutritional values by restaurant
types and found much higher calories and nutrients at full-service
restaurants.’

Less healthy: Olive Garden was one of a handful of full-service restaurants found to be less healthy than McDonald's when it comes to many menu items

Surprisingly unhealthy: Red Lobster, like sister chain Olive Garden, often had more calories per meal than are recommended on a daily basis

Also unhealthy: T.G.I. Friday's was also found to be surprisingly unhealthy compared to McDonald's

The study also found few ‘healthy choice’ menu options at
any of the chain restaurants.

By comparison, a regular sized Big Mac value meal at
McDonald’s comes in at 920 calories, 12 grams of saturated fat and 1,130
milligrams of sodium, according the burger chain’s website.

Researchers concluded that tighter portion controls
contributed to less calories and sodium at fast food restaurants.

There has not yet been conclusive research to show that
people consistently alter their eating habits based on knowledge of how
unhealthy food may or may not be.

The conclusions should also be taken with a grain of salt.
Fast food isn’t necessarily healthier, it’s just less unhealthy.
