Disgraced ex-CBS News anchor Rob Morrison lost his cool on Tuesday when he called his local newspaper to complain about their reporting of his upcoming court appearance on felony strangulation charges.

Morrison, 44, resigned from his $300,000-a-year job in February after police accused him of choking his Moneywatch anchor wife Ashley Morrison in a 'drunken rage'.

Local Connecticut newspaper The Darien Times reported that Morrison was due in court on Tuesday, April 30, but his appearance has been put back until May 21.

Disgraced ex-CBS News anchor Rob Morrison has agreed to a plea deal that means he can avoid jail for allegedly strangling his wife, Ashley Morrison. The couple have reportedly been seen spending time together again

The newspaper has reported that Morrison grew increasingly irritated during the conversation and resorted to insults and foul language.

He is reported to have used a ‘slew of insults and profanities to express his frustration at a story that had published that he claimed was “bull****” and “completely inaccurate.”’

The jobless news anchor also questioned how the 'shi***' paper got its information, claiming its sources 'suck.'

'You know every time you call my f***ing attorney, it costs me a thousand dollars?' he is allegedly to have said. When the reporter asked Morrison for an interview, he promptly hung up.

Morrison has agreed to complete two domestic-violence programs, undergo a psychiatric exam, participate in substance-abuse treatment and submit to random urine tests over the next two years

Rob Morrison called the Darien Times to complain about their story about his next court appearance.

He said it was ‘bull****’ and ‘completely inaccurate’

‘Your sources suck in the Stamford Court, and the Darien Times - I know this is big time for ya, OK, but your sources suck, brother’

‘The clerk is your source? [The state’s attorney] you f***ing idiot,’ he said. ‘F*** the clerk.’

He claimed the newspaper gets its information from ‘whatever is f***ing fed to you on some press release or some form.’

‘Good for you, bro,’ he said. ‘You know every time you call my f***ing attorney, it costs me a thousand dollars?’

He also described the newspaper as ‘shi***’ and hung up when he was informed the conversation was all on the record.

Last month is was revealed that Morrison is writing an autobiography which tells the story of his TV career and troubled marriage to fellow presenter Morrison.

Following his arrest in February, several allegations have 
emerged about the couple's difficult past with Morrison accused of infidelity and previous incidents of domestic violence.

He denies the charges and believes he can set the record straight in his book, according to the New York Daily News.

The newspaper also claims the former TV star hopes the book will be turned into a TV show. 

Mrs Morrison, who is living in the couple's $1.26million Connecticut home with their 7-year-old son, has returned to work following the incident. 

According to the newspaper, colleagues have made her welcome but she has not returned to the studio where her husband used to work.

Rob Morrison was arrested on February 
17 at the couple's luxury property and charged with attempting to 
strangle his wife in a drunken row. 

Morrison appeared in court on February
 20. He did not formally enter a plea but denied assaulting his wife 
while speaking to the media shortly before the hearing.

'I
 did not choke my wife. I have never laid my hands on my wife,' he said.
 'I was just as surprised by that particular charge as 
probably was everyone else whose heard about this story.'

He posted $100,000 
bail and is under a court order to stay out 
of the house and remain at least 100 yards away from Mrs Morrison at all
 times.

He has said he wants to stay married to his wife but faces up to five years in prison if he is found guilty.

Ashley's mother Martha Risk has spoken
 out against her son, who she has described as violent. He says he has a
 strained relationship with his mother-in-law.

Following the incident last month 
Morrison was pictured with a bloodied nose and lip himself.

He would not
 comment on his injuries but said the altercation he had with his wife 
was the kind of argument 'any family 
would have'.

At his first court appearance, police 
said they
 had been called at least eight times to break up fights between Rob 
and Ashley Morrison, beginning in 2003.

They were all described as 
verbal altercations apart from one incident where Morrison was arrested 
but court papers remain sealed.

Following the latest incident, the couple released a joint statement saying events had been 'greatly exaggerated'.

Police were called to the incident by Mrs Risk, who had been contacted by Mr Morrison in the course of the dispute.

Officers arrived at 1.30am.

Following the arrest they released a statement claiming Ashley Morrison had been choked.

'Upon arrival, it was ascertained that Morrison had been becoming 
increasingly belligerent toward his wife during the course of the 
evening, culminating in his choking her by the neck with both hands,' 
the Darien Police Department said in a statement.

Morrison is a former foreign correspondent who worked in 
Afghanistan and Haiti.

At a court appearance earlier this year, police said they had been called at least eight times to break up fights between Rob and Ashley Morrison, beginning in 2003
