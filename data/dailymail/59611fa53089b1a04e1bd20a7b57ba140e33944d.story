Former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton today claimed paying a £1,020 fine for drink-driving would be difficult 'because his finances are complicated' as he was banned from the road for 20 months.

The 63-year-old pleaded pleaded poverty as he admitted the charge during a 15-minute hearing at Colchester Magistrates’ Court this morning after arriving with his glamorous blonde girlfriend.

The football legend is currently going through a divorce after he split from his wife Sue, which was used as an excuse as to why he couldn't pay the court costs in full.

The court heard that he was found to have more than double the legal amount of alcohol in his system when he was breathalysed on February 24 following an anonymous tip by a member of the public.

He was driving a 2010-registered Jaguar XF near the home of his girlfriend, Stephanie Hayward, in Manor Road, Colchester, Essex, at time and was caught after an anonymous tip-off to police.

As he left court, Shilton, England’s most capped player, said: 'I’ve nothing to say, really - just that I had a very fair hearing.'

He left in a taxi from the nearby Colchester Town railway station.

Magistrate Ilona Perkins-Van Mil banned Shilton from driving for 20 months and ordered him to pay fines and costs totalling £1,020.

The court heard that Shilton had been drinking wine at a family celebration throughout the day but did not think he was over the limit.

Prosecutor Joseph Stickings said police were called to Ms Hayward’s home at about 8.35pm.

They had received an anonymous tip-off that a man, who seemed drunk, had been driving nearby.

'As police were speaking to a woman at the address, Mr Shilton pulled up behind the police car,' Mr Stickings said.

'The officer spoke to him and could smell alcohol on his breath. He was tested and provided a positive breath test.'

Shilton, of Burton Green, Kenilworth, Warwickshire, wore a charcoal suit with a tie today and spoke only to confirm his name and address and enter a plea.

He arrived with singer Ms Hayward, who sat in court wearing a black dress with lace sleeves.

Paul Tawn, mitigating, said Shilton would find it difficult to pay any fine because his finances were 'complicated' as he is currently going through a divorce and selling his house.

He added: 'He’d had a very pleasant day at a family celebration and had consumed wine with meals throughout the day.

'He had gone to move his car closer to his partner’s address because he had an early start.

'He didn’t travel far, just a couple of streets, and wasn’t driving very quickly at all.

'He was aware he had consumed alcohol but it was throughout the day so he did not think he was over the limit - if he had, he would not have pulled up behind the police officer.'

Mr Tawn described the arrest as a 'matter of deep regret' for Shilton, who has three points on his licence following a speeding offence in March 2011.

Ms Perkins-Van Mil warned Shilton he could face custody if he breached the ban and ordered him to pay the fine in full before leaving the building.

Friends rallied round the former 
England goalkeeper in 2011 when he moved out of the home he shared with Sue,
the mother of their two grown-up sons.

Shilton had a glittering career winning a record 125 England caps and lifting the then European Cup. 

He
played more than 1,000 competitive matches for 11 different clubs 
including Stoke City, Nottingham Forest, Derby and Southampton, during 
his career.

But off the field, the couple had problems.

Sue, 59, stood by him when he was caught with another man’s wife in his car which had crashed into a lamppost.

He admitted 'taking a lady for a meal' and was fined £350 and banned for 15 months for drink-driving.

Rival fans taunted him with chants of 'Shilton, Shilton, where’s your wife?'.

But Sue, who married the star in 1970, was at his side when he admitted a gambling addiction in his 2005 autobiography.

In 2009, Shilton and Sue appeared on 
the ITV show Mr and Mrs and she cheered him on from the audience when he
took part in last year’s Strictly Come Dancing.

His name is linked with one of the most famous incidents in football involving Argentina’s Diego Maradona at the 1986 World Cup.

Maradona described it as the ‘Hand of God’ when he apparently punched a ball past Shilton in a crucial quarter-final.

In recent years, 'Shilts' had been working as a property developer and football pundit.

A spokesman for him at the time said the couple agreed to a trial separation after drifting apart.
