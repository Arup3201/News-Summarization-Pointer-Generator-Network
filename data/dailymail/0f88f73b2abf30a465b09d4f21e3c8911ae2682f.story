A Los Angeles man claims he had a terrifying encounter with the man named as the alleged Zodiac killer in a book released last year. 

Publicist Chris Harris said he was stunned when he picked up a copy of The Most Dangerous Animal of All, believing he had encountered the alleged murderer in a diner in the 1970s.  

In the book Gary Stewart, who was adopted at birth, claims the search for his real father, Earl Van Best Jr, led to the discovery that the antique bookseller was the serial killer who terrorized San Francisco in the 1960s.

His mugshot looked strikingly similar to a sketch issued by police during the hunt for the killer - and Mr Harris claimed he spoke to that man.

Encounter: A Los Angeles man believes he met Earl Van Best Jr, the man suspected of being a Zodiac killer in a book released last year. The Zodiac killer slayed at least five people between 1968 and 1969

Publicist Chris Harris said he was stunned when he picked up a copy of The Most Dangerous Animal of All (left), believing he encountered the alleged murderer in a diner in the 1970s

He was making a documentary about the killer at the time which meant he had to go and visit Napa, California, the scene of one of the murders.

He told ABC 7: 'He turned round and he said "Do you have any idea what it's like to know you have to kill." I didn't say a word. I sat there in terror. This is the man that was in that diner.

His associate, Cory Skyler Drouillard, said there is more evidence Van Best is the killer. He says that prints from the right index finers of both the Zodiac killer and Van Best clearly have a scar.

The Zodiac killer murdered at least five people and injured two more between 1968 and 1969 in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Stewart claims to have 'legally sound' and 'forensic evidence' that proves that Van Best is the man responsible for one of America's biggest unsolved crimes. 

Van Best had a criminal record for rape and fraud, and his mug shot, found by the author, clearly resembles the Zodiac Killer's police sketch, down to the eyeglasses. 

Stewart's father died in Mexico City in 1984.

Similarities: The sketch released by police during the hunt for the Zodiac killer bears an uncanny resemblance to Best's mugshot 

Harris' associate Cory Skyler Drouillard, added there is more evidence that Best is the killer. He says that finger prints from the right index of both the Zodiac suspect and Best clearly have a scar

Stewart claims that his main breakthrough came when he solved one of the Zodiac killer’s ciphers sent to the newspapers during his spree.

The Zodiac boasted at the time that if police cracked the code then his identity would come out. The killer sent cryptograms to media outlets, some of which remain unsolved.

In a letter written to the San Francisco Examiner he had written ‘in this cipher is my identity”.

Stewart found the words 'EV', 'Best', and 'Jr'.

After his discovery he also claimed that another expert found 'Earl Van Best Junior' written backwards in another code.

The book claims that the chances of his father’s name being in two ciphers is 'astronomical'.

Cryptic: GaryStewart, the author of  The Most Dangerous Animal of All, discovered Van Best's name in one of the cyphers he sent to the media during his killing

Victims: From left are San Francisco cab driver Paul Stine, who was shot to death, Cecilia Shepard, 22, a student who was stabbed to death, and Bryan Hartnell, 20, who was stabbed but survived

Stewart then went onto match fingerprints taken from his father’s arrest and those from the crime scene. Both have a diagonal scar on them, he claims.

He then had a handwriting expert match the writing from the letters with his father’s signature from his wedding certificate.

Again he claims that he has an expert who would willing to stand up in court that they were a match.

Stewart claims that all this is enough to solve the case but that the San Francisco Police Department may be reluctant because it would cause embarrassment
