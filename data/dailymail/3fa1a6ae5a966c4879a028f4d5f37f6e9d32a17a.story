This baby penguin clearly wasn't camera shy as he posed for a picture before hungrily snapping his beak around the cameraman's legs.

The tiny King Penguin was among a gang of chirpy chicks which surrounded wildlife photographer Jon Cornforth as he set up his equipment.

The young birds were part of a huge colony based in Salisbury Plain, on South Georgia Island, in the south Atlantic Ocean.

Mr Cornforth, from Seattle, in the US, had to quickly hot foot it out as the hungry penguins went for his legs, while he set up a GoPro camera on the edge of the colony.

He said: 'It was pretty comical to be able to go back and look through that footage.

'There were hundreds of thousands of penguins in that area.

'While I was being respectful and keeping my distance, I was still able to get these amazing opportunities for photographs.

'Once you land on the beach there you are struck by the noise and the smell.

'Your senses are just on overload from being in that kind of wildlife situation.'

The area of Salisbury Plain is famous for being the breeding ground of up to 200,000 King Penguins.

Mr Cornforth said the area, which stretched over a mile in land from the coast, was home to a colony of anywhere between 2,000 to 5,000 penguins during his visit.

He said: 'King penguins are the second largest penguins second only to the emperor penguins, which everyone is familiar with.

'King penguins are beautiful with that yellow-orange patch underneath their neck. They are just stunning to be able to photograph in person.'

The baby penguins were around ten 
months old and had reached the time in their upbringing where their 
parents were weening them off being fed - causing them to become hungry.

Mr
Cornforth, who spent two days observing the penguins, said: 'A lot of 
them were getting to the point where their mum and dads weren't going to
be feeding them anymore so they were quite hungry and very curious.

'I'm six feet tall and the adult penguins came up to around my hip, with the babies being much, much smaller.'
