Motorists in Essex have been left bemused by 'Britain's most pointless lane' - a bizarre road layout which is not even long enough for the buses it was built for.

Residents in North Stifford, Essex, say the 'pointless' bus lane on High Road - which at 50ft long is not big enough for a double-decker - should never have been built.

The quirk in the road means cars and vans are forced  off a stretch of straight road and onto a narrow 'chicane-like' bend in order to avoid breaking the law.

Residents in North Stifford, Essex, are asking why the 'pointless' bus lane on High Road (pictured) which is just 50ft long and is not long enough for a double-decker bus, was built. They claim it is a 'hazard'

Every week thousands of drivers  have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled to come along the route each day.

Following a series of accidents, the lane has now been branded a 'hazard' with motorists questioning what its purpose is.

Emma Taylor, 24, a hairdresser from nearby Grays, spotted the strange road layout when she was driving at the weekend.

She said: 'It really is bizarre. I drove through it on the way to my mum's house.

'I found it so strange that I actually had to turn back and have another look to make sure I was not seeing things.

'The bus lane is so short that it is pointless and I nearly bashed the alloys on my Audi when I went around the traffic islands.'

People living near to road say there have been a series of accidents which they believe have been caused by cars struggling to get through the narrow layout as they avoid the bus lane.

Miss Taylor added: 'I understand why we need bus lanes and I think they are a good idea normally but this has to be the most pointless one in the country.

'I have shown pictures of it to my friends and they were all laughing and wondering what on earth its there for.'

Another driver, who asked not to be named, said: 'There is no obvious reason why it is here.

'It's very narrow so I assume the highways bosses think it is slowing cars down but it's on a 30mph stretch of road here so it's not as if motorists are driving fast along here.

'I think it's more likely to cause accidents rather than prevent them.

'The bus drivers must find it very amusing as well.' 

A Thurrock Council spokesman said: 'At the time the bus lane was put in – in 2007 – the North Stifford village was suffering from HGVs using High Road as a short cut to and from the nearby A13 and especially when the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge and M25 southbound was jammed.

'High Road had and still has safety speed restricting tables across the road width and it also has a number of aging houses close to the road, this lead to residents suffering noise, dirt and major vibration problems.

'The installation of a bus gate of this type has effectively reduced HGV traffic while still allowing public transport access to and through the village.

'The council has received no complaints from villagers about this bus gate in recent years.'
