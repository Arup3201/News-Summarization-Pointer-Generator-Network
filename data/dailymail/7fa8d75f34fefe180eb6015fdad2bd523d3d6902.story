Dramatic new photographs taken by a shaken passenger following the Asiana Airlines plane crash on Saturday have revealed the chaotic moments after the jetliner smashed into the ground at San Francisco Airport.

The images, taken by Eugene Anthony Rah, show thick billowing smoke and flames overwhelming the shell of the plane as scores of passengers run for safety. The smoke clouds the sky as emergency responders battle the fire, and passengers and air hostesses huddle together in shock on the tarmac.

Amid the chaos, it is possible that an emergency responder vehicle hit and killed one of teenagers who died in the wreckage, authorities revealed. Two 16-year-old Chinese schoolgirls, Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, died in the crash but officials said one was possibly hit by a fire truck or an ambulance.

San Francisco's medical examiner is now conducting an autopsy to determine whether she was dead before she was struck.

'One of the deceased did have injuries consistent with those of having been run over by a vehicle,' fire department spokeswomen Mindy Talmadge said. 'Many agencies were on the field.'

In the chaos of the crash-landing of Asiana Airlines 
Flight 214, dozens of police cars, fire trucks and ambulances rushed to the scene to help recuse the jetliner's 291 passengers and battle the blaze that broke out on board.

Witnesses reported seeing dozens of people running on the tarmac, attempting to escape the burning wreckage of the plane.

Rah, a 46-year-old concert producer and naturalized U.S. citizen who took the photographs, said that he noticed one flight attendant, Kim Ji-yeon, stood out as she was 'carrying people piggyback' who couldnâ€™t walk.

He said that she was sobbing as she helped clear the plane just minutes before flames engulfed the plane and that he noted down her name because 'she was a hero'.

Images from inside the stricken Asiana Airlines Flight 214 have also been released by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. They show seats slammed out of their rivets and oxygen masks dangling from the overhead compartments, giving some indication of the terror that the 307 passengers and crew experienced during the plane's botched landing.

Asiana Airlines said Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, both from Jiangshan in eastern China, were headed for a summer camp in the U.S. - part of a group of 70 Chinese students and teachers aboard the Boeing 777 that crash-landed.

Ye Mengyuan, a promising gymnast, and 
Wang Linjia, who loved physics, had been inseparable for the four years 
since they met at middle school. They often ate lunch together and both 
enjoyed school, CNN reported.

While
 one of the girls - it is not known which - was possibly killed by a 
vehicle, the other died after being ejected from the plane.

A total of 141 Chinese nationals were aboard the flight that was bound for San Francisco from Seoul, South Korea.

Miss Wang's parents were both on the fight, as well, and could be seen sobbing as they learned their daughter died in the crash.

The pilot of the plane, Lee-Kang Kook, was on his maiden training flight and had only 43 hours experience at the controls of a Boeing 777.

'He was training,' a spokeswoman for Asiana Airlines, Lee Hyomin, said. 'Even a veteran gets training. He has a lot of experience and previously had flown to San Francisco on different planes, including the B747 ... and was assisted by another pilot who has more experience with the 777.'

The black box on the Boeing 777 jetliner detailed three crucial moments - beginning 7 seconds before impact -
 that show the plane was approaching the runway too slowly and that the pilots were trying to correct the problem. As they attempted a surge in speed, the tail of the plane hit the ground.

National
 Transportation Safety Board officials said on Sunday that the jetliner, 
which was carrying 291 passengers, was flying 'significantly' slower 
than the 137 knots that is ideal for jetliners preparing to land in San 
Francisco.

NTSB Chair 
Deborah Hersman said an 
initial examination of the plane's in-flight data recorders show no 
indication that the plane was in trouble until 7 seconds before impact. 
It was at that point that the pilots tried to increase the speed of the 
plane.

'We have to take another look at the 
raw data and corroborate it with radar and air traffic information to 
make sure we have a very precise speed,' Hersman said.

'But again, we are not talking about a few knots here or there. We're talking about a significant amount of speed below 137.'

By
 all accounts, the plane was set to land normally - its landing gear was
 down and its flaps were set to the standard 30 degrees.

Just four seconds before the plane crash-landed, a 'stick shaker' warning 
activated, notifying the pilots that the plane was about to stall.

The
 'stick shaker' literally shakes 
the control stick that the pilot is holding. It is meant to tell the 
pilot that the engines will stall if the aircraft maintains the current 
speed. Then, finally, 1.5 seconds before impact, the voice recorders 
revealed that the pilots were planning to abort the landing.

The pilots announced a 'go-around' - 
an aborted landing in which the plane approaches the runway but instead 
of  touching down, it lifts off again and circles around to approach the
 runway again.

The 
Asiana Airlines flight failed to come to land fast enough, hitting its 
tail on the ground rather than landing on its wheels. It broke apart and
 caught fire as it tumbled in cart-wheels on 
the runway shortly before noon on Saturday.

The crash killed the two teenage 
Chinese students, one of whom was reportedly ejected from the plane when
 the tail section broke off. At least two people have been paralysed by 
their injuries, while others suffered head trauma, broken spines and 
road rash, apparently from being dragged. Some 185 passengers were 
hospitalized in total.

Hersman cautioned that the findings 
from the black box aboard the plane are the result of only a preliminary
 investigation of that in-flight data.

Investigators
 have also not yet spoken to the captain and first officer who were 
flying the plane. They hope to interview the pilots in the coming days.

Hersman refused to speculate on whether the crash was a result of pilot error or a mechanical failure.

A
 study of the weather at the time reveals that there were no reports of 
wind shear or other adverse conditions at the time, according to the 
NTSB. The pilots navigated the landing manually, but sight on the 
bright, sunny day, in part because the instrument landing system on the 
runway was inoperative.

Questions: A piece of the landing gear can be seen on the tarmac as NTSB investigators document the wreckage

Investigation: NTSB officials said it could take months to reach a conclusion, but preliminary tests suggest the plane was traveling too slowly

Probe: Investigators are beginning to analyze the plane's flight data recorders - the so-called black boxes that contain all technical data from the doomed flight

Fireball: A total of 307 people were on board the plane when it crash-landed. Most managed to walk away from the crash
