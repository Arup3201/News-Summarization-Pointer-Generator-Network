A bride has been killed just hours after her vows after her husband lost control of their car, sending it hurtling off the highway and ejecting her from the passenger seat.

Kali Dobson, 25, was next to her new husband, 27-year-old Ryan Quinton, as he drove the Pontiac Firebird from their reception at Wheeler House in Ball Ground, Georgia on Sunday night.

At around 8.30pm, Quinton lost control of the vehicle, which careened down an embankment and ejected Dobson, who was not wearing a seatbelt.

The vehicle came to a stop on top of the bride, according to Franka Young, the 
spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Safety. She died at the scene of the accident.

Quinton later told authorities that he lost control of the vehicle after swerving to avoid a dog in the road, the Marietta Daily Journal reported.

After the crash, he ran to the road where, with his clothes torn and covered in blood, he flagged down help.

Chris Thomas told Channel 2 that he was driving along Ball Ground Highway when he spotted Quinton wearing a shredded tuxedo and stumbling along the road.

'His shirt was all torn up and he was 
bleeding,' he said. 'He had blood all over his face and blood coming out
 of his hands and stuff and just looked bad. And it scared me to death.'

He comforted the sobbing man as they waited for emergency responders. He held the Quinton's hands and they prayed together.

'There was nothing that could be done,' Thomas said after returning to the crash site. 'The car was on top of her. You couldn't even see her.'

Quinton was taken to hospital, where he continues to recover from his injuries. It is not known if he was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.

Authorities
 took a blood sample and are investigating whether alcohol was a factor 
in the crash. The newlyweds had celebrated with family and friends at 
their reception before getting into the car.

Any charges in the tragedy with depend on the results of the blood test, the Georgia State Patrol said.

'Blood was drawn to determine if alcohol was a contributing factor,' Young said. 'The crash is still under investigation. Charges are pending.'

After the tragedy, distraught friends and family visited the spot where Dobson had lost her life.

'Some bridesmaids showed up and then things got really, really sad and hopeless for a minute,' witness Chris Thomas told Fox5. 'It was horrible all the way around. And tragic.

'Me and my wife were discussing it, and I said, "I bet it was the most beautiful day of her life".

'What
 should have been the greatest, most beautiful day of their lives is the
 end of one and what could very well be something hard for this young 
man to get over. I pray that he will.'

Friends and relatives expressed their heartbreak on Facebook pages and shared photos of the couples grinning and dancing at the reception just hours before the tragedy.

The wedding photographers, Still Pearl Photography, also shared stunning images of the beautiful bride before her vows and dancing happily with her new husband afterwards.

Patsy Jordan, a Cherokee School Board member, who once worked with Dobson’s mother, told the Marietta Daily Journal that the community is stunned by the tragedy.

'It’s traumatic,' Jordan said. 'Just to think she just got married and started on her beautiful journey of life and it just ended so suddenly. It was just hard to wrap my brain around something like that.'

Jordan said she Dobson, who had sisters and was close to her new sister-in-law, had a beautiful singing voice.

'Our
 thoughts and prayers are with the Dobson and Quinton families,' the 
company wrote on its Facebook page. 'May Kali and the love this 
beautiful couple shared never be forgotten.'
