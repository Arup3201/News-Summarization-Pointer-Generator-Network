A contractor suffered head and shoulder injuries at a National Grid construction site in north London this morning after he was 'crushed by machinery'.

The 24-year-old man was taken to hospital 'as a priority' from the site in Eade Road, near Harringay, where National Grid are tunnelling towards St John's Wood as part of a London Power Tunnels project.

It is understood that the man was crushed by machinery during a tunnelling operation, although a National Grid spokesman insisted it had not and that the tunnel structure was sound.

Firefighters, ambulance workers and police attended the scene, where the contractor was injured

The spokesman refused to explain how the worker was injured, despite an employee reporting that he had heard that a workman had been crushed in the incident, and doctors had to treat him in the tunnel.

The National Grid spokesman said: 'An incident took place at the Eade Road construction site in Harringay at approximately 6am today.

'A contractor working at the site sustained non-life threatening injuries and received medical treatment.

'Our thoughts are with the contractor and we hope he has a prompt recovery.

'Health and safety is of paramount importance to us.'

The spokesman said work had been temporarily suspended at the site while the circumstances are investigated.

He said: 'There is no problem with the tunnel structure, it was an accident. The structure of the tunnel is sound.'

The Health and Safety Executive have been informed of the accident, and are investigating.

Tunnel workers were evacuated from the tunnel after the accident.

Firefighters were alerted just before and were joined by police and paramedics.

A London Ambulance spokesman said: 'We were called at 6.05am to reports of an incident at Eade Road, N4.

'We sent two ambulance crews, a single responder in a car, two duty managers and a London Air Ambulance crew by car, as they do not fly at night.

'Staff treated a 24-year-old man for head and shoulder injuries.

'The patient was taken as a priority to the major trauma centre at Royal London Hospital.'

The site, a former Maynards sweet factory, is undergoing a tunnelling project.

The National Grid website said A 40m shaft has been constructed and a tunnel boring machine has been lowered down the shaft in sections and is tunnelling towards St Johns Wood.

Once this is complete, a headhouse will be constructed.

Cables will be lowered into the shaft through the headhouse, ready to be energised.

Another worker at the scene told how the tunnel was being constructed like an 'underground tunnel - with pre-formed concrete being pushed into place by hydraulic rams.'

A large number of lorries outside the site were carrying the preformed arcs of concrete waiting to be unloaded.
