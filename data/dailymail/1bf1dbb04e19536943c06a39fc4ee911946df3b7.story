The toddler who died in his father's hot SUV in Georgia last month had been switched out of his forward-facing new car seat weeks before his death - even though he was too big for his old one.

Cooper Harris was found dead in his rear-facing car seat in a parking lot in Cobb County, Georgia on June 18 - after sweltering inside for more than seven hours.

His father, Ross Harris, faces a murder charge in the boy's death - but insists he mistakenly left his 22-month-old son inside the car before heading to work at Home Depot.

With the boy in the rear-facing seat, Harris would not have seen his child if he looked over towards it.

Loss: Cooper Harris, pictured with his parents Justin Ross and Leanna, had been switched out of a seat that might have been easier for his father to see him in the back of the sweltering car

During a probable cause hearing on Thursday, Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified that the boy was 'several inches' too big for the child seat, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

He added that the parents had bought a new, forward-facing child seat just six weeks ago but they switched back to his old seat for reasons that are not yet clear.

'Harris knew the specific make and model of the seat and what the weight limit was for the child to be seated in it,' the warrants state. 'When the seat was inspected the straps for the seat were set on the lowest level for a small child.'

Harris told detectives his son was 'developing fine'.

Suspicions are also growing about what role Harris' wife may have played in the death.

Emotional: Harris is facing additional charges of sexual exploitation of a minor as well as murder

Leanna Harris has not yet been charged with any crime but she expressed little emotion throughout Thursday’s hearing, despite a number of shocking allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed away.

Investigators also described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious.

When
 workers at her son's day care said that Cooper had never been dropped 
off, she calmly responded: ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There's 
no other explanation,’ Stoddard said.

When
 reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been 
charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him: 'Did you say too much?' 
according to Stoddard.

When she called home June 18 with the 
grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone 
saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’

Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’

Aftermath: Guests leave the funeral for Cooper Harris after hearing an emotional call from father Ross from prison as he said goodbye last month

Police
 had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched 
children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling 
officers it was her ‘worst fear.’

At Cooper’s funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him.

‘Ross
 is and was a wonderful father,’ she told mourners, before telling her 
husband of seven years: ‘I love you and I’m doing this for you.’

Some of Leanna Harris’ comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions.

'Some
 of you might wonder how I’m standing here today and I ask myself the 
same question,' the deeply religious mother said.

Heartbreaking details: Detective Stoddard testified that there was scratch marks on Cooper Harris' face and abrasions on the back of the toddler's head

'I should be crumpled 
into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing 
behind me, holding me up.'

The
 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her
 two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, 
even if she could.

'He’s in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is,' she said.

Detective Stoddard also told the court 
that several injuries were found on the boy's body, including 
visible marks on his face, revealing that he had struggled to escape as temperatures soared.

Justin Ross Harris remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges. He has been denied bond.
