Teacher Erin Gaskell faces 10 years in jail for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old pupil she taught

A female Spanish teacher has been warned she faces up to ten years in prison after sexually assaulting a 15-year-old male pupil.

Erin Haskell, 32, pleased guilty to second-degree sexual assault on one of her students while she worked at Toms River Intermediate South in Beachwood, New Jersey.

Haskell taught Spanish to fifth to eighth-grade students at the school and also served as faculty advisor to the drama club.

Her victim was a 15-year-old male who was subjected to sexual abuse between June 2012 and September 2012, taking place in Beachwood and Barnegat, the town where Haskell lived.

Haskell was told she faces up to ten years in state prison after pleading guilty to second-degree sexual assault at the Superior Court yesterday.

The case was passed on to the county Prosecutor’s Office by the state Institutional Abuse Investigation Unit of the Department of Children and Families, authorities said.

A date for her sentencing has not been set yet.

Before Haskell is sentenced she must undergo a psychological evaluation to determine whether she is likely to commit any further sexual offences.

A report on her mental health from the Avenel Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center in Woodbridge is expected to be presented to the court in about four months and will be a factor in her sentencing, Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office said.

Haskell also will be subject to Megan’s Law registration, parole supervision for life and barred from ever having contact with the victim.

In exchange for her guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to drop the more serious charge of aggravated sexual assault and other offences related to the crime.

Judge Francis R. Hodgson accepted the plea during an afternoon hearing.

Haskell has been released on bail, which is set at $300,000, since her arrest in November.

Ben Giovine, president of the Toms River Regional Board of Education, said Haskell was suspended without pay following her arrest in November and resigned on January 11.

He said the board will try and ensure a similar situation doesn't happen again by being more vigilant.

'We hold our teachers up to the highest standard of conduct,' Mr Giovine told Asbury Park Press.

'We all have to continue to be vigilant to ensure that a situation like this doesn’t happen again.'

Mr Giovine, 30, added that in the 1990s, when he was growing up, teachers did not act this way.

'It seems more commonplace,' he said.

He also highlighted a recent case where another female teacher, this time at Wall Township High School, was arrested last week on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old male student.

Kalee Warnick, 22, was arrested last week on charges of third-degree aggravated criminal sexual contact and second-degree having a sexual relationship with a minor she had care over, according to the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office.
