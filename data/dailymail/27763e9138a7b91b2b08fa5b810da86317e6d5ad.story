Sergio Aguero came to the rescue again for Manchester City with two super strikes but the draw left them eight points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea.

Charlie Austin fired the home side ahead after having two efforts ruled out but Aguero equalised despite hint of offside and handball in the build up.

QPR went ahead again when Austin's cross was headed into his own net by Martin Demichelis under pressure from Bobby Zamora but Aguero came to the rescue again with an 83rd minute equaliser.

 Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan was at Loftus Road and rates all the players' performances. 

City midfielder Yaya Toure blew hot and cold but set up Sergio Aguero for his second goal

QPR

Rob Green

Caught well, made a few good saves and looked more assured than he has previously. 6.5

Mauricio Isla

Didn’t really have anyone to mark per se, which can be tricky for full backs. Helped Eduardo Vargas down the right to good effect. 7

Steven Caulker

Nothing he could have done about Sergio Aguero’s first half goal. Often a spare man, he tracked the buzzing runs of Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri. Great header off the line late on. 7

Richard Dunne

Brilliant early block to deny Samir Nasri. Even brought the ball out from the back on occasion. Heroic display - and cleared off the line too. 7.5

Yun Suk-Young

Had the beating of Jesus Navas and was vastly improved after a bad afternoon at Chelsea last weekend. 7

Eduardo Vargas

Again asked to play out of possession on the right, but - just as at Stamford Bridge - put in a decent shift. Has quality on the ball. 7 

QPR striker Charlie Austin continued his rich vein of form with well-taken goal

Sandro 

Lost the midfield battle with Fernando, but did get himself on the ball and looked to make things happen. 6

Karl Henry

Spoiler, and a good one at that. QPR will need Henry firing if they are to stave off relegation. Raises his game against the best. 7

Leroy Fer

An absolute waste on the left, but has become more rough and ready than he was at Norwich last year. Decent on the ball. 6.5

QPR midfielder Karl Henry did a superb spoiling job in the centre of midfield

Charlie Austin

Showing that he can really mix it in the top flight. Took his goal well and was unfortunate not to add more. 7.5

Bobby Zamora

Gives QPR an added dimension. Sometimes there is no shame in going a touch longer and Zamora is the perfect battering ram. Won everything. 8

Subs

Joey Barton (for Sandro, 46 mins)

Sent on at half-time to do a job on Nasri, who was substituted late on. Good on the ball and made a terrific block in stoppage time. 6.5  

Sergio Aguero saved Manchester City further embarrassment with two super strikes

Manchester City

Joe Hart

Had an embarrassing moment in which he scuffed a free-kick he touched twice - prompting great debate over the laws of the game - but did make a collection of superb stops. 7

Bacary Sagna

Booked for deliberately tripping Leroy Fer after being bullied off the ball by the midfielder. Summed up his evening. 6 

Martin Demichelis

Abysmal. Didn’t track his runners, failed to win his headers and looked shaken all evening. 4

Eliaquim Mangala

See Demichelis, but that bit worse. Perhaps too soon to write the £32million man off - he is only 23 - but there is no doubt he is struggling. Can’t even do the basics. 3.5

Gael Clichy

Got forward well, although did afford Vargas too much space on occasion. 6

Fernando

Mixed it well with the tenacity of Henry and Sandro. Did the simple jobs well and allowed the flair players to do their thing.  7 

Fernandinho

Made a ghastly error just before the break which presented Austin with a great chance but got hold of midfield. 6.5

Samir Nasri

Flitted in and out, as Nasri does tend to do. Dangerous around the box but couldn’t find a killer ball. 6.5

Jesus Navas

Curious - should have been the perfect evening for him on the break but never really got going. 6.5

Yaya Toure

Sometimes breathtaking, but often frustrating. Toure’s problems are amplified because of the quality you know he has in his locker, but a wonder ball for Aguero’s second equaliser. 7

Sergio Aguero

He’s just too good. Give him a chance and Aguero scores. It’s 14 for the season now and his two touches in mid-air were superb to fashion the first. Where would City be without him? 9

Subs

Edin Dzeko (for Fernandinho, 64 mins)

Lasted just four minutes after picking up an injury.

Frank Lampard (for Dzeko, 68 mins)

Never got going. 6

James Milner (for Nasri, 74 mins)

Hit Isla flush in the face when presented with a glorious opportunity. 6

Martin Demichelis (4) was abysmal and Eliaquim Mangala (3.5) even worse

Charlie Austin (7.5) and Bobby Zamora (8) were a constant menace
