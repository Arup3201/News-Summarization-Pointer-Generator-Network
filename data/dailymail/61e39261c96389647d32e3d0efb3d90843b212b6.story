More than two decades after she became a household name for alleging she had a 12-year affair with Bill Clinton, Gennifer Flowers has made yet more shocking claims about the former president.

Flowers, who enjoyed a lucrative modelling and acting career as well as top book sales following her announcement in 1992, has claimed that Clinton called her as recently as 2005, begging to see her.

Speaking with WGNO, Flowers, 62, said was at home alone in Louisiana following her divorce when her phone rang.

'I picked up the phone and it was him,' she told host Susan Roesgen. 'And he wanted to come by my house and talk to me. I was taken aback; that was the last thing I expected.'

Claims: Gennifer Flowers, who hit headlines during the 1992 presidential
 campaign claiming she had an affair with Bill Clinton, has claimed in an interview with WGNO that he 
contacted her in 2005

She added that, even when she refused to allow him to visit, he persisted.

'I said, "No you
 can't come over here",' she continued. 'He said, "I'll put on a hoodie and I'll jog up 
there" and I said, "No, I want you to leave me alone". And that was that.'

Former president Clinton has yet to respond to a request for comment from MailOnline over the claims.

The call allegedly came decades after Flowers claimed they had a years-long affair while Clinton was governor of Arkansas. He later claimed they only ever had one sexual encounter in the 1970s.

Speaking out: Flowers is pictured announcing her alleged affair with Clinton on 27 January 1992

Controversy: Flowers speaks about the affair, which she claims took place when Clinton was governor of Arkansas, during a live television interview with CNN host Larry King January 1998

But in another bombshell on WGNO, Flowers claimed Clinton had in fact discussed revealing the affair in the 1990s as he was struggling to achieve the recognition he needed to win the presidency.

'I made him a household name over night,' she told WGNO. 'We had had that discussion. He said, "My problem right now is that no one knows who I am. I need that name recognition".

'He went on to talk about the other candidates and the advantages they had... When my story came out, he was a household name.'

The claims come as Flowers appeared on the show in the wake of the David Petraeus sex scandal to discuss life as the mistress of a high-profile man.

Denial: Clinton, pictured in 1992 with his wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea, initially denied the claims but later admitted he had had one sexual encounter with Flowers in the 1970s

More trouble: He was later accused of having an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky

'It's very unfortunate,' she said of the Petraeus affair. 'It does really surprise me. But there's always something like that around the corner.'

To Paula Broadwell, the biographer-turned-mistress of Petraeus, she said: 'Call me Paula! I'll give you some really good advice... You'd better buck up, it's going to be one hell of a bull ride.'

Of her own claims about her affair with Clinton, she added: 'I really thought that coming out and telling the truth would set me free, but it didn't.'

Flowers spoke out in January 1992, as Clinton fought for the White House, and claimed she had had a 12-year affair with the married father of one during his time as governor.

Life after: Flowers, pictured left in 2011 and right in 2006, went on to pose for Penthouse magazine and feature in independent films and television shows. She is about to star in a reality show in New Orleans

'Call me!' In the interview, Flowers also warned Paula Broadwell, the mistress of David Petraeus, that she was in for a bumpy ride following the revelations about her affair

She later released tape recordings she claimed she had secretly made of her and Clinton's phone calls, although there was doubt over their authenticity.

In 1998, Clinton admitted he had a sexual encounter with Flowers and added in his 2004 autobiography 'My Life' that it was only on one occasion in 1977, when he was already married.

Following her claims, Flowers posed for Penthouse magazine and featured in independent films and television shows. She said her claims netted her $500,000.
