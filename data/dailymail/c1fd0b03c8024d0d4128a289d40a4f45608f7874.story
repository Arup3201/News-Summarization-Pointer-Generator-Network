Germany and Argentina will do battle for the biggest prize in world football at the Maracana, but one man has already achieved victory at the World Cup.

Heine Allemagne, 43, the man man who invented the magic vanishing spray adopted for use in Brazil, us set to reap the financial rewards after years in poverty and facing bankruptcy.

The foam has proved a huge success in stopping defenders from encroaching on the 10-yard gap on free-kicks, and disappears in 60 seconds.

Premier League officials are considering introducing the foam, which has been used in Brazil and Argentina's domestic leagues, into England's top-flight.

Heine told the Mirror that seeing the spray being
 used for the first time at the World Cup was a 'magical moment' and 
added: 'I dedicated 14 years of my life to this idea.

'After the referee brought it out the first time I started receiving text messages from my family and friends.

'It was the first time I got emotional, my eyes welled up. I remember thinking, "I’m not crazy. It was all worth it".'

Allemagne
 grew up as one of five children living in a crowded three-bedroom house
 in Ituiutaba, a small town between Sao Paulo and Brasilia.

In the air: The Premier League is expected to discuss with clubs whether to use it

In action: The spray stops defensive walls from encroaching too far forward

'We
 all slept together in one small room. I never had any toys and we had 
few clothes. My parents sent me out to work at the age of eight.' he 
said.

But now, Allemagne acknowledges he is set to make a lot of money if his product is adopted globally.

'I
 hope that whatever financial gain is comparable to my 14 years of 
struggle. I’ve paid a high price. I chose not to see my children grow up
 so that I could make this work.'

He
 continued: 'Most of all, though, I hope to have contributed to football
 – that we now have a tool that will help referees to keep order, help 
free kick takers score more goals, and improve the experience of 
football for everyone.'
