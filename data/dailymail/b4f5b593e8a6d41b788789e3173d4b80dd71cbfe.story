Louis van Gaal can forget about signing Kevin Strootman in January, Roma have warned the Manchester United boss.

The box-to-box midfielder is wanted by United and is valued at around £30million. Van Gaal is a big admirer of the playerhaving worked with him while managing Holland.

But the Italian club's general director, Mauro Baldissoni, has admitted the club are furious with the persistent talk of Strootman joining United.

'Our president (James Pallotta) has already spoken about this and he gets angry with the rumours that link (Strootman) to Manchester United,' Baldissoni told Radio Anch'io Sport in Italy.

'Our policy is that of investing in players that have quality but have room for improvement.

'Kevin is a young player with experience, and we want to build our future with players like him.'

Roma have long insisted that Strootman is going nowhere, with Pallotta even claiming he would turn down a £75m bid for the player. 

But Strootman also has admirers at other big clubs across Europe and Roma's Champions League exit at the hands of Manchester City could push him closer to the Stadio Olimpico exit.

The 24-year-old has only recently returned from a serious knee injury which kept him out of action for seven months and forced the former PSV Eindhoven star to miss the World Cup last summer.
