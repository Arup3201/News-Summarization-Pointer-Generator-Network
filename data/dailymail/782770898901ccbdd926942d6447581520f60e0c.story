An artist has interpreted some of life's greatest stories in fine detail - on just an eyelid.

Make-up professional and blogger Tal Peleg, from Israel, paints fairy tales and great novels onto tiny areas of the face using only liquid eyeliner and eyeshadow.

With clever mixing techniques and a steady hand, she recreated scenes from Snow White, The Princess And The Frog, The Little Prince, The Ugly Duckling and Les Mis√©rables, as well as more novel designs.

We've all heard of 'cat eye' make up, but Tal took this quite literally and designed make up of an actual cat playing with yarn.

The cat's tail was painted on her eyebrow and she stuck a real tiny ball of string on her face.

Tal
 says the power she sees in makeup 'is not just the ability to make a 
woman more beautiful, but in general its ability to transform'.

She has more than 7,000 likes on 
Facebook and 9,000 followers in Instagram, where she posts regular 
updates of her new designs and inspiration.

Modelling her creations on herself, Tal's bright blue eyes make the designs stand out.

For The Princess And The Frog, the artist uses her eyebrow for the Princess's hair, and paints on a bow to emphasise this.

effect of the poster. She uses the same technique of taking the artwork 
colour scheme for her Little Prince eyelid.

Other designs include children's show The Moomins and Kick-Ass inspired make-up.

Recently, she posted a step-by-step guide to how she created her Ugly Duckling eyelid.
