A bull who killed three people and injured thirty more in a decade-long career of amateur bullfights has died - and will now be stuffed and placed on display for his fans.

Ratón - whose name translates to Mouse in English - passed away in Spain yesterday after suffering from a limp for more than six weeks.

Aged 11, the 79 stone beast had been a star attraction at events across the country - where runners are encouraged to sprint past the animals to 'show their bravado'.

Ratón's owner plans to stuff the body of the 79 stone beast and display him at his farm

The 'vaca', as it is dubbed by locals, regularly attracts hundreds of spectators - but unlike a bullfight does not end with the animal's death.

Ratón commanded fees of up to €10,000 (£8,540) per appearance, and had last taken to the sand at the bullring in Valencia on March 15.

Ratón's owner, Gregorio de Jesús, told El Pais that his body will now be stuffed and displayed on the farm he owns in Campanar, near Valencia.

Ratón was born to Caracol and Fusilera on April 12 2001 and shot to fame, aged six in 2006, when he fatally gored a 54-year-old man in Sagunto. 

Rather than lead to his retirement, the death sparked a flood of offers for him to appear at events across the country.

In 2008, he struck again by killing a 27-year-old by goring him in the neck.  It led to de Jesus to again consider ending his career.

But he soon decided not to, telling El Pais: 'What do you do if they put a cheque in front of you and say 'fill in the amount you want'?'

In 2009, he then boasted about his animal, by telling the same newspaper: 'He's agile, intelligent, fast. Very happy.

'But he's not stupid, he's not like other bulls who act on instinct and hit against everything.

'This one thinks, analyses and then attacks.'

Ratón's final kill came in 2011, when he gored a 29-year-old man at a festival in Xativa.
