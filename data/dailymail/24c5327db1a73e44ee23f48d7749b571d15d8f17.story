The Rio protestors’ attack on the ITV World Cup studio during the opening game was frightening enough for those in the booth to believe they were being shot at.

The windows of the studio bridging the road along the Copacabana Beach were said to be broken by ball-bearings fired from a catapult but they made a similar sound to gunfire to the ITV team, which included presenter Adrian Chiles and pundits Lee Dixon, Patrick Vieira and Fabio Cannavaro.

To add to their understandable concern there were reports of a body lying on the road underneath. This later turned out to be the victim of a traffic accident who had been hit by a bus.

An ITV insider said: ‘Everyone inside the studio stayed very cool but you can image the concern of their friends and family watching back home.’

ITV have demanded that security is increased  and, in the circumstances, their ‘curse’ striking again with their heavily-publicised ITV Player crashing just as Neymar was about to score Brazil’s second goal was regarded as less of a priority.

Mike Riley, in charge of the elite referees in the Premier League, was one of the 13-strong FIFA referee assessment panel responsible for choosing Japanese official Yuichi Nishimura to take charge of the opening game, in which he awarded the softest of penalties to Brazil.

FIFA insiders say that Nishimura, whose weak performance was heavily criticised by defeated Croatia, was chosen because he represents a different confederation from the teams involved and had a good World Cup in 2010.

Almost the entire 70-plus membership of the England party at the World Cup gathered in the dining room at their Blue Tree Premium Hotel in Manaus to watch the opening game of the tournament.

However, it’s safe to assume that the bets weren’t flying around like in the old days — especially in Italia 90 when Peter Shilton (right) was the bookmaker.

At last Sepp’s on side

Sepp Blatter’s proposal at the FIFA Congress for managers to appeal against decisions during games might not be as left-field as first thought. Sports technology leaders Hawk-Eye are already testing immediate offside decision-making in the Dutch League.

Meanwhile, the unnecessary goalline technology (GLT) replay of Brazilian Marcelo’s own goal, when the ball was obviously way over the line, is understood to have been screened by the host broadcasters because of an agreement to show GLT in action during a game, irrespective of it being needed.

The Brazilian-themed Congress opening entertainment included a surprise appearance by a Palestine singer. Surely that wasn’t connected with Blatter’s naked ambition to win a Nobel peace prize, having brokered talks between the Israeli and Pakistan football federations?

Conspicuous by his absence from the Congress and the opening match was football icon Pele, who is Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s ambassador for the tournament.

It seems that Pele has yet to settle his differences with the Brazilian football federation after he fell out with the disgraced former overlord Ricardo Teixeira, who is mired in corruption scandals.

It won’t be on the scale of the Brazilian protests that are in danger of overshadowing the World Cup but military personnel will be demonstrating outside talkSport’s London headquarters at noon on next Saturday.

This follows the radio station’s failure to respond to the serious upset caused by their pundit Stan Collymore’s offensive tweet about the Falklands.

One of the more bizarre sights in Manaus, gateway to the Amazon rainforest, is a fully grown jaguar, one of the big beasts of the nearby jungle, sadly enclosed in a relatively small cage as the showcase exhibit of the zoo in the Tropical Hotel.

It’s claimed the Brazilian Institute of Environment has approved all the enclosures.
