A thief stole the purse of an 82-year-old woman as she lay dying in the road after being hit by a lorry. 

Officers say it is one of the most 'disgusting crimes they have investigated' and are urging witnesses to come forward. 

The pensioner was killed in the collision with a heavy goods vehicle in Leigh, near Manchester, on Wednesday morning. 

The pensioner was killed in the collision on Leigh Road, in Leigh near Manchester on Wednesday morning - while at the scene, witnesses reported seeing a man make off with the woman's purse

Police were called following the incident on Leigh Road at around 11:45am - with the woman declared dead shortly after they arrived.

While at the scene, witnesses reported seeing a man take the woman's purse before fleeing. 

Detective Sergeant Neil Lawless said: 'This is one of the most disgusting crimes I have ever investigated and I find it hard to believe someone could stop so low to commit such a horrific offence.

'This man has taken what he sees as an easy opportunity by stealing a purse from a dying woman.

'I am sure the community will be equally disgusted and I appeal to anyone who may have seen this man take the purse and walk off on Leigh Road.

'There are a number of rumours circulating on social media at the moment but I would like to reassure residents we are doing all we can to find out who is responsible.

'However, for us to do so, we need your help.'
