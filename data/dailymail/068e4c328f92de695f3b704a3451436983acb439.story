A man accused of killing his young wife and dumping her body in a shallow grave 18 years ago has pleaded not guilty in court.

Steven Fesus is accused of murdering his wife Jodie Fesus after her body was found near a popular camping spot at Gerroa on the NSW south coast 16 years ago.

The security guard was arrested in 2013 over her alleged murder and was arraigned in the NSW Supreme Court on Friday.

Steven Fesus walked from NSW Supreme Court on Friday carrying a newborn baby after he pleaded not guilty to killing his wife Jodie in 1997

Jodie, then 18, was reported missing from the couple's home near Wollongong in August 1997 after recently returning home from their honeymoon. 

Roughly one month later, her body was uncovered in a shallow grave at Seven Mile Beach after police were tipped off by an anonymous caller.

Fesus, who lived in the same suburb with the couple's children for 15 years, denied involvement in Jodie's death and maintained she had disappeared.

He was arrested just one week after his teenage daughter Kimberley made a public appeal for information about the suspected murder of her mother.

Kimberley and her brother Dylan were both at court when their father appeared shortly after his arrest.

Despite having several requests for bail denied, Fesus was granted bail under NSW's new risk management bail laws last year.

Fesus appeared at the NSW Supreme Court on Friday and will go to trial on October 12.

It's expected to last eight weeks due to the 'significant' number of witnesses listed. 

The security guard was arrested in 2013 over her alleged murder after repeatedly denying any involvement in his wife's murder for 15 years
