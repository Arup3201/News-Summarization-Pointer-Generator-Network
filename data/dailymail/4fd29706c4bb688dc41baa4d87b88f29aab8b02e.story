Foray into fashion: Sarah Jessica Parker is launching a shoe collection called SJP next year, which will be available exclusively at Nordstrom

Sarah Jessica Parker is teaming up with Manolo Blahnik CEO George Malkemus to launch a new line of shoes, bags and trench coats, which she promises will feature 'beautiful combinations' of colors.

Simply named SJP, the collection will hit shelves exclusively at Nordstrom early next year.

'In a silly way, I think it's what people have expected of me most because of Carrie Bradshaw,' the 48-year-old actress told Vogue.

The announcement today was timely, since it marks the fifteenth anniversary of Sex and the City's first episode.

Ms Parker's Sex and the City character 
Carrie Bradshaw was known for her insatiable penchant for shoes - 
especially Manolo Blahniks.

In one famous episode, she said: 
'I've spent $40,000 on shoes and I have no place to live? I will 
literally be the old woman who lived in her shoes!'

Unlike Carrie's pricey footwear weaknesses, however,
which pushed her to the brink of bankruptcy, SJP 
shoes will range in price from $200 to $300.

Purses - which she says will reference the Seventies and Eighties - will cost around $700 or less.

According to the mother-of-three, shoppers can expect this line to be unique: 'We're putting new colors together that 
people don't typically do,' she said.

'Just beautiful combinations that you wish 
existed in your closet.'

Mr
Malkemus has been the CEO of Manolo Blahnik for the past 31 years, 
helping to transform the business from a 'fledgling to designer with 
tiny U.S. sales' to a veritable empire, according to WWD.

His partnership with Ms Parker is appropriate, since both are responsible for making Manolo Blahnik a household name.

Indeed, the actress admits that 
playing shoe-obsessed Carrie for six years forced her into learning more
than a few things about fashionable footwear.

'Because I
got to play that role, I wore a lot of shoes,' she said. 'And by 
default I learned an enormous amount. It's hard to walk away from that.'

This
isn't the first foray into fashion for Ms Parker, who acted as creative
director of Halston Heritage from January 2010 to July 2011.

As such, the actress has a few ideas when it comes to the aims and purposes of fashion.

'You
put on a shoe and you put on a coat and you wear a bag and, on the 
outside, when youâ€™re walking down the sreet, they really can tell the 
same story about yourself,' she explained.
