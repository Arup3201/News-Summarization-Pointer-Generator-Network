Fitness guru Kayla Itsines is famous for sharing photos of her clients amazing before-and-after body transformations with her million-plus Instagram followers.

But the 23-year-old personal trainer from Adelaide, who has become an internet sensation thanks to her bikini body guide, has now showed how she  helped  a young woman who suffered from  anorexia get fit and healthy.

On Saturday Kayla shared the before and after selfie photos of Mikhaela Antoon, 17, from Sydney, showing her journey back to health after suffering from the eating disorder for four years.

In the after shot, despite still looking slim, Mikhaela can be seen looking happy, fit, toned and healthy as she shows off her right bicep in a classic fitness pose.

The pose is typical of the pictures Kayla shares to her followers of herself after a work out. 

Mikhaela’s stomach also looks incredibly toned in the after picture - a stark contrast to the before photo, which shows the young woman on the beach looking dangerously thin.

Kayla commented on her client’s 'amazing result' and shared the email Mikhaela had written to her:

'I can't thank you enough Kayla,' the email read. 

‘I have struggled with anorexia for four years now.

‘With the help of both your guides, I have finally found my place between a healthy mind set and healthy lifestyle.

‘I thank you for being such a positive role model and for your dedication to your work.

‘Every day I wake up feeling stronger and healthier all thanks to YOU!"’

Following the encouraging email Kayla reiterated her health and fitness message saying: ‘It doesn't matter what shape or size you are.

'EVERYONE achieves the same results, HEALTHY, lean, toned, strong and confident.

‘These things are all achieved, and are results of, hard work and dedication!’

More than 29,000 followers liked the post and many commented with supportive comments.

One said: ‘Yes! Such a transformation,’ while another wrote: ‘So inspiring.’

Glowing: Mikhaela has said she has finally found my place between a healthy mind set and healthy lifestyle

Definition: Three weeks ago the Sydneysider shared this pic of herself working out, captioned: 'Back to the grind.'

Since becoming healthier, Mikhaela appears to be in a   happy frame of mind and her Instagram account is littered with pictures of her not only working out, but also enjoying delicious  meals.

She also regularly shares pictures of inspiring sayings which include: 'Your health is your greatest wealth' and 'Feeling strong is the best feeling.'

But perhaps most tellingly, just over a year ago she uploaded a post which read: 'Dear Past, thank you for all the lessons. Dear Future I am ready.'

Kayla certainly seems to have mastered the equation needed to achieve a healthy physique, coupled with a high level of fitness and strength without bulk.

The successful business woman now has a staggering 1,190, 484 Instagram followers at last count, which included Victoria’s Secret angel Candice Swanepoel.

On her website she explains how she began personal training in 2008 and quickly realised that she wanted to start helping women achieve a bikini body in the most 'efficient and effective way possible’.

She adds: ‘My clients saw amazing results in 12 weeks or sometimes even sooner, and began to tell their friends and spread an amazing positive message.’

Earlier this month Kayla, who regularly shares pictures and videos of herself working out, spoke to Femail about her popular workout and meal plan. 

Her rules include always eating breakfast, 'even if you don’t necessarily feel like it. Having a good serve of protein, carbs and fats in the morning is the best way for you to start the day. You will have lots more energy to keep you going until lunch time.'

Abs-olutely fabulous: She says anyone can obtain these results and be lean, toned and healthy

She also recommended to eat three main meals and two small snacks a day. 

Kayla’s bikini body workout consists of targeted circuits which aim to work on specific ‘problem’ areas of the body while also burning calories.

Her diet plan aims to give you plenty of energy for her intense workouts, while reducing fat and calories to help you slim down.
