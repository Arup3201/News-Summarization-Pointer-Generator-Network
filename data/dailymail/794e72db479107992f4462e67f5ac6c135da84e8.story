Should Liverpool have any hope of snatching the Premier League title away from Manchester City, it will require goals, goals, points, and some more goals.

Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge have answered that call all season – but a surprising set of statistics shows those from the England striker have proven more valuable.

Crystal Palace must be beaten at Selhurst Park for Brendan Rodgers' side to maintain their challenge and for that the SAS strikeforce have to be on form.

And it is Sturridge, rather than PFA Player of the Year Suarez, who has done most to get Liverpool to this point. 

Suarez has scored more Premier League goals this campaign than Sturridge – 30 to 20 – and the Uruguayan also finds the net more frequently – with a goal every 92.8 minutes, compared with 105.5 minutes.

But the England star's goals have engineered more points and arrived in more desperate scenarios. Five of his 20 have come when Liverpool were behind in a match, while, quite remarkably, Suarez has managed that only once.

Further, when you subtract Sturridge’s goals from final scorelines it shows they have accounted for 18 points. For Suarez, that tally is 15 points. So despite playing fewer minutes (2,110 to 2,784), Sturridge has had greater impact in this aspect.

Allied to this is Sturridge’s ability to perform against the division’s bigger teams. Clearly, Suarez is no slouch but the average position of teams he has scored against is 14th in the table, while for Sturridge it is 11th.

Sturridge has also scored a significantly higher proportion of his goals against Liverpool’s direct rivals with 20 per cent of his total coming against teams in the top six. For Suarez, who failed to score against City, Chelsea, or Arsenal this season, that figure is 16.7 per cent.

We need goals: Brendan Rodgers knows his team need a rout or hope City drop points

Suarez is often asked to play deeper that his partner in tight games, perhaps accounting for a drop-off, and even so, he has 12 assists to Sturridge’s seven.

Rodgers will not care how the goals come against Palace, he will be well aware Tony Pulis has made his side notoriously hard to break down. Trailing City by a goal difference of nine means that only a rout will give them a chance if City keep winning.

These numbers show it may be Sturridge, rather than Suarez, who seizes the initiative.
