A man who faces life imprisonment for raping and killing a University of New Hampshire student in 2012 does not want to appear for his sentencing this week.

Seth Mazzaglia was convicted June 27 of first-degree murder and other felonies in the death of Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott of Westborough, Massachusetts.

Prosecutors say he strangled, then raped the 19-year-old Marriott in his Dover apartment after she rebuffed his sexual advances.

Mazzaglia, 31, is scheduled to be 
sentenced Thursday and at least 11 family and friends of the victim are 
expected to give statements. In a brief motion filed Friday, Mazzaglia 
said it is his constitutional right to not appear.

In his response, prosecutor Peter Hinckley wrote, 'To be sure, the defendant has a constitutional right to be present, and can waive that right.' But he said Mazzaglia has not set forth any reasons he should be absent,
 and that the interests in having him present outweigh his objection.

Prosecutors will argue against the motion at a hearing Tuesday in Dover.

Mazzaglia's girlfriend, Kathryn McDonough, 20, is already serving jail time for hindering prosecution.

McDonough testified that she lured Marriott to their Dover apartment because Mazzaglia, a karate instructor, wanted another woman to join their sexual escapades, which 
included bondage.

She at first told investigators that Marriott died during rough sex between the
 two women that involved restraints.

After getting immunity from 
prosecution, McDonough changed her story and said Mazzaglia strangled 
Marriott, then raped her. Mazzaglia did not testify.

In court, she testified that Mazzaglia was the sexually dominant partner in their relationship and became angry when she left for nearly two weeks at theater camp without recruiting a sex partner for him.

As what she called punishment, Mazzaglia told her to lure a woman — Marriott — to the apartment on Oct. 9, 2012.

After a game of strip poker which prosecutors say Marriott willingly joined, Mazzaglia suggested she kiss his girlfriend.

Miss Marriott said no, saying she was in a committed relationship. Mazzaglia then asked if she would watch as he and McDonough had sex. She again said no.

Prosecutors said the domineering Mazzaglia was unaccustomed to being rejected so, as the two women watched a movie, he sneaked up behind Marriott and choked her with a rope.

McDonough testified that she left the room briefly and when she returned, found Mazzaglia raping Marriott's limp body.

The two of them threw her in a river that feeds into the Atlantic Ocean.

The victim's body has never been found.

Hinckley said Mazzaglia should be held accountable for the crime, that his presence in court will help avoid any unnecessary and unwanted confusion, and that the interests of the victim and her family are 'hardly more compelling than in this case.'

'The defendant received his fair trial,' Hinckley wrote. 'It is now fair for him to personally receive the sentence that will result from such.'

Jurors heard testimony over the course of 19 days and convicted Mazzaglia after a full day of deliberations.
