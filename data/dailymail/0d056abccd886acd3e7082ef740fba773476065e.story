Oscar Pistorius is 'coping' with his new life behind bars and managed to get some sleep during his first night in his solitary cell, according to a prison official who visited him today.

The 27-year-old convicted killer was dressed in an orange prison-issue jumpsuit and seemed to be coping 'so far so good' when he was seen by Ofentse Morwane from the correctional services department.

The Paralympic gold medallist  is undergoing a 36-hour 'comprehensive needs assessment' and orientation programme to inform him of the strict rules and regulations as a 'B' group inmate at the Kgosi Mampuru prison.

He is starting a five-year sentence for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp – but could be out just ten months. 

His first night behind bars came as the model's parents told how they do 'not feel that justice has been done' but insisted they 'have to accept' the sentence imposed by the judge. 

Mr Morwane said: 'Once we have processed the inmate properly, we can draw up a "sentence plan" for him and make him aware of what programmes are available to him.

'I think he did get some rest over night and he looked to me like he was coping with his new situation.

'He has everything he needs. 

'Upon arrival yesterday, all of his belongings were taken from him for safe-keeping until his release and he was allocated a cell, sheets, blanket, pillow, toothpaste and toilet paper.'

The hospital wing at the Kgosi Mampuru facility is heavily guarded round the clock and staffed by two trained nurses.

The double-amputee's 'B' group classification entitles him to keep a small number of personal photographs in his cell, have two 'no-contact' visits at weekends and on public holidays – with a maximum of 45 visits per year.

Once he has served six months of his sentence and proved himself to be a co-operative prisoner, Pistorius could be elevated to group 'A' - which would entitle him to more visits and and enjoy special privileges such as chocolate and Coca-Cola.

The disgraced sprinter is one of nine disabled offenders, out of a total number of 7217, being held in the prison, which was formerly known as Pretoria Central and was notorious under apartheid rule for its brutal treatment of political prisoners.

The kingpin of one of its notorious 'numbers gangs' has already threatened to order 'a hit' on Pistorius if he is shown preferential treatment.

Khalil Subjee, who is known as The General, leads the feared 26s gang which rewards acts of violence with promotion within the gang hierarchy.

Mr Morwane insisted the prison's most famous inmate would 'certainly not' enjoy any special treatment during his incarceration.

'Every prisoner receives the same treatment here, Mr Pistorius will be no different.'

Nevertheless, the South African runner was taken unshackled and alone from Pretoria's high court to the jail in an armoured police vehicle, with armed outriders. 

Remand and newly-sentenced inmates appearing at the court are usually transported together in the back of a large prison van.

The athlete's legal team had argued that prison posed 'a danger' to him because of his disability and fragile mental state.

But Judge Thokozile Masipa said she believed Pistorius's disability had been 'over-emphasised' and his 'excellent coping skills' would equip him to adapt to life behind bars.

'Justice has NOT been done - only Oscar knows the truth': Reeva Steenkamp's parents hit out as athlete faces just 10 months in jail for killing their daughter 

The parents of the model shot dead by Oscar Pistorius say they do 'not feel that justice has been done' but insisted they 'have to accept' the sentence imposed by the judge.

Pistorius, 27, known as the Blade Runner, was yesterday jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 29, but could be out of prison in just 10 months.

The sentence has been criticised by some as too lenient and sparked calls for it to be increased.

'Disappointed': Reeva Steenkamp's parents, June and Barry, do not believe justice has been served after Oscar Pistorius was handed a five-year jail term for killing their daughter - meaning he could be out in just 10 months

Miss Steenkamp's parents told ITV's Good Morning Britain they accepted the sentence and 'don't want revenge' or for the double-amputee to 'suffer with his disabilities' while prison.

But they said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, adding that 'only Oscar knows' the truth.

Miss Steenkamp's mother June told the programme: 'I think the law must take its course, we have to accept what has happened. 

'If there is an appeal, well, there is an appeal. There is nothing we can change about that. But it will be difficult to go on even further, again.

'We may not feel that justice has been done, but we have just got to accept what the judge decided.

'That's the law, although it could have been completely different if her decision was different.

'Not everyone is entirely happy. But ... the facts that she had before her maybe weren't enough. But we have to live.'

Mrs Steenkamp said the family had been 'disappointed in her (the judge's) judgment', but felt the judge was left with few options because 'she only had certain facts before her'.

Mrs Steenkamp said the family are 'very settled with the sentence'.

She added: 'He has got to pay for what he has done and it is not that we want vengeance or anything, or for him to suffer with his disabilities.

'But at the same time, we feel satisfied that he will realise that you can't go around doing things like that.

'We don't want revenge, we want a fair punishment under the circumstances of his disability. 

'We wouldn't have wanted him to go to jail and be abused and I feel that it is fair.

'He will realise that he can't go around doing that. He can't kill somebody like that.'

Her husband Barry said: 'We have gone along with the judge and her decision. 

'Only Oscar knows whether that sentence is acceptable to him. I've got my feelings to the whole thing. 

'But we do accept what the judge handed down.'
