Caroline Cici Bellis may not be a household name yet, but the 15-year-old Justin Bieber-loving tennis junior from California is about to be.

Just three years after a tiny Cici posed with her idol Maria Sharapova, the wild card stunned Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova in the biggest upset of the U.S. Open so far, winning 6-1 4-6 6-4 against the 12th seed in her grand slam debut.

But who is Cici - the number two junior in the world who became the youngest woman to win a match at the U.S. Open since Anna Kournikova in 1996 and the youngest American to win a match at the U.S. Open since Mary Joe Fernandez in 1986?

The bubbly teenager was born in April 1999 in San Francisco and lives in Atherton, California. 

She first picked up a racket when she was just three, and was naturally gifted thanks to her lineage - her mother played junior tournaments when she was younger.

But it was just four years ago - when she was 11 - that she properly turned her focus to the game.

'I went into the match thinking it was going to be such a great experience, but I never thought I would come out on top,' said the teenager, who next plays Kazakh Zarina Diyas.

Cici, ranked 1,208, is currently the No. 2 junior behind Ivana Jorovic of Serbia.

She has won a series of prestigious junior titles including the Easter Bowl Championships, USTA International Spring Championships, and the Coffee Bowl.​ She's also playing the U.S. Open junior tournament. 

Cici's amateur status means she is unable to claim the more than 60,000 US dollars in prize money for a first-round victory, but she is in no rush to turn professional.

She said: 'I think I'm definitely going to stay an amateur right now to keep my options open for college, in case an injury or something happens. But I'd love to be a pro one day.'

Cici's wild card wasn't charity, she earned it when she won the USTA Girls' 18s National Championship, becoming the youngest to win the title since Lindsay Davenport, according to Sports Illustrated.

Her idol is Kim Clijsters and the youngster says she models her game style and energy after the four-time major champion, though an adorable picture shows a tiny Cici posing with Maria Sharpova just three years ago. 

'It's crazy to think that I'm actually here right now with all these other people,' she said of Tuesday's match. 

'I never thought I would be practicing or sharing a court with a player that I watch on TV frequently. It's crazy. But I love it.'
