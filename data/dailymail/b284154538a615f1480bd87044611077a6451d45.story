Screenwriter Nora Ephron amassed a huge fortune by investing in the stock market, it has emerged

Acclaimed screenwriter Nora Ephron, who penned the 1989 blockbuster When Harry Met Sally, left an estate worth $27 million, almost double the original estimates after playing the stock market, it has emerged.

Ephron, who died last year, reaped huge financial rewards after investing in internet and technology giants such as Google, Amazon and Apple.

A final accounting of her will, filed in Manhattan Surrogate’s Court last week, revealed she left around $10.2 million in stocks and other investments as well as a property empire worth over $12 million.

Ephron, who as well as writing also directed and produced a number of successful films amassed $642,000 in Apple shares, more than $110,000 in Google and around $89,000 in Amazon.

Among the properties owned with husband and fellow screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi were a smart Beverly Hills bungalow, a mansion in East Hampton and a Co-op on Manhattan's East 79th Street, the New York Post reports.

Ephron had an additional $4 million worth of personal property, including possessions worth $240,000 inside her Manhattan apartment and some $500,000 in cash, mortgages and loans.

When her will was originally filed in September last year her wealth had been estimated at around $15 million.

At her request more than $100,000 was spent on a lavish funeral service at at Lincoln Center attended by many of the stars who appeared in her films.
