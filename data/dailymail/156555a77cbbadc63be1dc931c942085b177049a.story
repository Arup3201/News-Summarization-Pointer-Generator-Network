The moonwalking hologram of Michael Jackson that rocked the Billboard Music Awards last night has landed the show's organisers in a legal row after the British billionaire behind its technology claimed it was used without his permission.

The ghostly apparition of the King of Pop wowed spectators with a rendition of Slave To The Rhythm, a track taken from Jackson's posthumous new album Xscape, dancing about the stage in a golden jacket and red trousers as fireballs shot around him.

But despite the gimmick's apparent success at Las Vegas' MGM, Alki David - who owns Hologram USA - says his holographic technology was stolen, a claim organiser Pulse Entertainment's CEO John Textor denies.

Hologram USA holds the patents for the state-of-the-art technology with Musion Das Hologram Ltd.

Judge Nancy J. Koppe of the Nevada court granted Alki last minute emergency access to the show - sparking angry backstage scenes as he and his team of lawyers clashed with MGM bosses.

During the heated confrontation, Alki alleged that a former Musion employee was discovered backstage and 
that the court had been misled.

It is also understood that Musion 
believe the quality of the show would have been far more spectacular had they been involved.

Mr David said: 'It is no surprise that Pulse was stealing our technology. I partnered with the inventor Uwe Maas to bring the magic back to entertainment and itâ€™s just such a shame that people like John Textor and his cronies felt it necessary to behave this way.'

Pulse were not immediately available for comment.

The
 onstage resurrection garnered a standing ovation by the massive 
star-studded audience, who were clearly moved by the performance nearly 
five years after his death.

However, only
 on Friday did a federal judge rule that the Billboard Music Awards 
could use the hologram, rejecting efforts from tech companies seeking to
 block the digital performance.

Judge Kent Dawson said there wasn't 
enough evidence to show the planned 3-D image would violate patents held
 by Hologram USA Inc. and Musion Das Hologram Ltd.

The
 companies own rights to technology known for digitally resurrecting 
deceased rapper Tupac Shakur at the 2012 Coachella music festival.

'The court's decision is not 
surprising,' attorney Howard Weitzman, who represented Jackson's estate 
and dick clark productions, wrote in an email. 'The request to stop this
 extraordinary Michael Jackson event was ludicrous.'

Plans
 to use the hologram during the show on Sunday emerged with the lawsuit, 
but were not confirmed until the hearing Friday afternoon. Show producers
 had been promoting only a 'history-making performance' at Las Vegas' 
MGM Grand Garden Arena that would promote Xscape.

Hologram USA and Musion said in their 
emergency lawsuit on Thursday that one of their products was being used 
without authorisation by a competitor to create a segment that depicts 
Jackson performing Slave to the Rhythm.

Attorney
 Michael Feder, representing the show and Jackson estate, filed a 
response on Friday, saying the holographic performance had been planned 
for months and was discussed with Alki David, who owns the rights to the
 technology that creates and projects lifelike images to appear 
alongside live performers through Hologram USA and Musion.

Plaintiff's attorney Ryan G. Baker said his clients were disappointed with the ruling, but the lawsuit will continue.

'It's
 only the very beginning of a case that will continue to be prosecuted 
by my clients, and ultimately they are confident that they will prevail 
and will recover all available damages for the defendants' infringing 
conduct,' Baker said.

Hologram USA obtained the rights to the patents after the bankruptcy of Florida effects house Digital Domain, which created the Shakur image to wide acclaim two years ago.

The lawsuit also named John C. Textor, the chairman of Florida-based Pulse Entertainment Corp. who was the former head of Digital Domain. Pulse is accused of using the hologram techniques without a proper license. A phone message left for Textor was not immediately returned.

Back in the day: Michael is seen here in February 1988. He died nearly five years ago, in June 2009

The lawsuit names Atlanta-based Pulse Entertainment Inc. as a defendant. Spokesman Ken S. Johnson said the company was listed incorrectly because it had no connection the Billboard Music Awards.

In March, Hologram USA sued Cirque du Soleil and MGM Resorts International over its show, Michael Jackson ONE at Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino. The show features a performance by a digital rendition of Jackson, which the company also contends is an unlicensed use of its technology.

The case is being handled in a Los Angeles federal court and Cirque du Soleil and MGM Resorts have been granted an extension until May 23 to respond to the lawsuit.
