The life and career of Robin Williams were celebrated as part of Game 5 of the World Series at AT&T Park in San Francisco on Sunday.

The smiling face of Williams, in a variety of his most well-loved characters, adorned the big screen in a stirring tribute to the late award-winning actor.

His oldest son Zak then lofted an emotional ceremonial first pitch to Billy Crystal to start the game between Williams' San Francisco Giants and the Kansas City Royals.

A special tribute for Williams played on the main center-field scoreboard, featuring highlights of his films as well as photos of him from various visits to the ballpark - one with home run king Barry Bonds and Hall of Famer Willie Mays.

A clip of Williams leading fans in a pregame chant also played, and Crystal got things going with his own chant of ‘Play ball!’

‘We are honored to be here in support of the tribute to our father, someone who loved his hometown and especially the Giants,’ Williams' children said in a statement through the Giants.

‘For all of us, it is a tremendous delight and a little surreal to throw out the ceremonial first pitch of a World Series game for our team to our dad's best friend. 

'We could not think of a better way to celebrate his memory. Let's go Giants!’

Williams, who lived in nearby Marin County, died August 11 of an apparent suicide. He was 63.
