Ed Miliband is being urged by Labour MPs to give up hopes of securing a decent Commons majority and focus resources on 'limping' into Number 10.

Senior Labour figures have told MailOnline the leadership must slash the number of target seats from 106 to as few as 70.

It comes amid growing fears that Mr Miliband's personal unpopularity is holding the party back and will fail to make inroads in enough constituencies to give him an outright majority.

Ed Miliband today sought to shake off speculation about his leadership with a promise to take the general election fight to the streets.

In a 1,000-word Facebook post, he said next May's vote will 'decide the future direction of our country'.

He added: 'Labour will fight and win this election street by street, house by house, taking our case to the people on every issue.

'That is how I am going to be spending the next six months. That is what my Shadow Cabinet and our MPs will be doing. 

'That is what our councillors, party members and activists will be doing – because that is what they do week in and week out – and they know that is how we win.

'We are in the fight for the future of our country and in the General Election Labour will show we are equal to the challenges of the time in which we live.'

Today marks six months to go until the general election, when Mr Miliband hopes to return Labour to power.

Last night Mr Miliband dismissed talk of a leadership coup against him as 'nonsense'. Today Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham were forced to issue statements dismissing reports they were planning for a 'post-Miliband future'. 

Labour currently has 257 seats and needs to win another 24 from the Tories to become the biggest party and at least 70 to secure an outright majority and not have to enter a coalition.

At present Labour has a list of 106 target seats given additional money, support and activists in a drive to woo swing voters and give Labour a sizeable Commons majority of almost 40 seats.

But there are now calls for the ambitions to be dramatically scaled back to just 70 seats, which would be enough for Labour to secure a majority of just two.

A shadow minister told MailOnline: 'You look at the list of marginal seats, and I have been to a lot of them, and you just think we're not going to win that one, we're not going to win that one…

'We are not going to win 106 more seats. Somebody needs to have a difficult conversation with the people in 30 or 40 of those seats and say 'look, we can't justify giving you extra money when you're not going to win'.

'The money would be better spent on 70 key seats in the hope we can limp over the line.'

The admission comes after a meeting of North West Labour MPs this week where the idea of abandoning dozens of target seats was also discussed.

The gathering of 30 or so North West based MPs was chaired by the Blairite veteran and former Cabinet minister Hazel Blears. She has been sidelined by party high command since the election defeat of 2010, but has long argued that Labour must broaden its appeal.

Mr Miliband's team had hoped that the rise of Ukip would eat into Tory support allowing Labour seize seats across the country.

But the party was stunned by the recent Heywood and Middleton by-election in its Greater Manchester heartland where Ukip came within 600 votes of taking a supposedly safe Labour seat.

Labour needs to take 24 seats directly off the Tories to make it the biggest party in the Commons.

However, there is a growing sense that it will struggle to retake key seats like Rossendale and Darwen or Bury North.

'We think we're going to get Brighton Pavillion back from the Greens, but Caroline Lucas is so dug in we've got no chance,' said one normally loyal Labour MP.

'We need to be realistic and direct what money we've got at the seats we stand some chance of winning.'

Labour MPs are also dismayed at a collapse in support in Scotland.

A devastating poll last week suggested Labour is facing near-wipeout north of the border.

Ipsos Mori found that 52 per cent of Scots would vote for the SNP if there, compared with just 23 per cent for Labour.

A devastating IpsosMORI poll for STV last week revealed how support for the SNP has surged since 201

It means Labour would be left with a rump of just four MPs, shattering Mr Miliband's hopes of becoming Prime Minister.

A former Labour minister told MailOnline: 'I went to Scotland during the referendum campaign and even in our strong areas like Glasgow the organisation is hopeless.'

At the 2010 general election Labour won 42 per cent of the Scottish vote, compared with the SNP's share of 19.9 per cent. 

Polls show Mr Miliband he is now less popular than every leader for 30 years who has taken their party to defeat in a general election, with 'depressed' Labour MPs fearing he will cost them victory in 2015.

Even Gordon Brown's personal ratings were better six months before he too Labour to defeat. 

Several senior Labour figures now believe the party would be performing better with almost anyone else in charge.

Mr Miliband's fate appears to hinge on whether shadow ministers – some of whom are understood to have met privately to discuss his future – can agree on his fate and engineer a 'coronation' rather than a divisive leadership contest with an election only months away.

The Times reported that Ms Cooper, the shadow home secretary, and Mr Burnham, the shadow education secretary, to have struck a 'non-aggression pact'.

But a spokesman for  Ms Cooper said there was 'no foundation whatsoever' to the suggestion.

'The spreading of lies like this only damages the Labour Party and should be seen as exactly what it is - complete and utter garbage,' he said.

'Yvette, the shadow cabinet and the party are united behind Ed's leadership.'

Shadow health secretary Mr Burnham said: 'The stories in today's newspapers are complete and pure fiction. There is not a shred of truth in them.

'What I think it's part of is a deliberate and desperate attempt to destabilise the Labour Party and to divide us. But I can say this: it won't work. We are a united team, we are united behind Ed.'

He told Sky News: 'My focus is on the NHS, exposing the damage that this Government is doing and working hard to deliver the Labour government that this country needs and certainly that my constituency needs.

'That is where my focus is. I'm working hard to support Ed Miliband in every single way I can.' 

Writing on the Politics Home website, shadow business secretary Mr Umunna said the rumblings were 'nonsense which some in the Westminster bubble want to distract us with'.

Mr Umunna added: 'The simple fact is that because of Ed Miliband's leadership we are now within touching distance of being what many thought impossible four years ago.

'We have a leader who has kept us united and overseen the renewal which so eluded us at the end of our time in government. Ed is an honest, sincere man of deep beliefs.'

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'Ed Miliband is the right person to lead Labour and the right person to lead Britain. He has shown the ideas and the leadership to take Labour into government and to complete the historic task of Labour as a one-term opposition.

'We're focused on the issues that matter to voters - on the cost of living crisis facing my constituents in Stoke-on-Trent, on the NHS, on reforming technical and vocational education to give every young person the opportunity to reach his or her potential.

'We're a united party and that will remain as we expose the failures of David Cameron's woeful record.'
