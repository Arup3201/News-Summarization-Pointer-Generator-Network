England and Sale fly-half Danny Cipriani took time to relax before joining up with Stuart Lancaster's summer training squad by fuelling speculation about his love life.

The 26-year-old joined up with Lancaster's 55-man England training squad on Sunday - a day after being spotted attending a film set with ex-girlfriend Jasmine Waltz.

He will train with his England colleagues until Wednesday, when he will return to join pre-season training at Sale.

It is the second time in less than a 
week that Cipriani and Waltz have been spotted together after they 
enjoyed a lunch date in Manchester.

After the couple broke up in 2010, she branded the rugby player a 'horny teenager' and warned Kelly Brook not to take him back.

According to a witness, Danny met with the director, after which he 'introduced Jasmine and chatted to producers'.

A
 representative for Danny told MailOnline that although he is not 
affiliated with the film itself, he has friends on set and was visiting 
with Jasmine.

MailOnline have contacted a representative for Jasmine Waltz for comment.
