When Luke Thompson found himself home alone for a weekend, he wasted little time in contacting a former lover for some company.

But the love cheat reckoned without Kelsie Davies contacting his girlfriend on Facebook to admit to their night of passion - even describing the couple’s bed linen to prove it.

A court heard how Thompson then ‘dug himself into a hole’ as he attempted to cover up his cheating - and told Amijane Thomas that Miss Davies must have broken in to their home to know what it looked like inside.

Miss Davies, the mother of two of his children, spent five hours in custody being questioned by police - and a month on bail - until officers eventually uncovered Thompson’s deception.

The father-of-three is now starting a ten-month prison sentence after admitting perverting the course of justice. The judge was told both women have now washed their hands of the love cheat.

Leicester Crown Court heard on Thursday how Thompson decided to two-time Miss Thomas, 18, while she took month-old Logan on a weekend break away with her family, in June.

Thompson, 25, arranged to go clubbing with Miss Davies and the couple returned to the terrace home he shared with Miss Thomas in the city.

But the court heard a row broke out after Miss Davies discovered Thompson had fathered a son with Miss Thomas. Miss Davies then contacted the teenager on Facebook ‘and revealed she had slept with him and described the inside of his home to prove it,’ prosecutor Victoria Rose said.

‘Confronted by his new partner, he said the former one had lied and hadn’t been to the address and if she had it was because she had burgled it.’ Thompson then claimed his BlackBerry and camera had gone missing, so Miss Thomas contacted police to report a burglary.

Thompson repeated the claim in a statement to police three days later, also alleging his partner’s hair-straighteners had been damaged. Miss Davies was then arrested and spent a month under suspicion for a crime she had not committed.

But Ms Rose told the court: ‘There was something about her account which rang true with the police, which led to (police uncovering) CCTV footage showing them meeting up and both entering his home together. During her (Miss Davies’) interview, she said she damaged the defendant’s partner’s hair-straighteners and received a caution.’

Thompson was arrested and maintained throughout two separate interviews that his former partner had broken in, continuing the lie even after being shown the CCTV footage of them together.

Subsequent phone texts showed his ex-partner had asked him to tell the truth, to which he kept replying ‘It’s too late’.

Sentencing Thompson, Judge Robert Brown said: ‘He’s lied, lied and lied again.

‘He cheated on his current partner to get back with his former partner and then lied to get the former partner into trouble.

‘An innocent person was at risk of imprisonment for something they hadn’t done.’ Speaking from her parents’ home in Glenfield, Leicester, Miss Thomas described her former boyfriend as a ‘compulsive liar’ who had ‘lied and lied again’.

She said: ‘I already knew Kelsie and when she contacted me on Facebook she seemed unrepentant about what happened.

‘She described not just the pattern of our bedlinen but what Logan had in his cot, the colour of our carpets - the whole house.

‘Luke denied it all and said he’d had his phone and driving licence taken. But we found parts of his phone in the back garden, and he never reported his missing licence to the DVLA.

‘He would still be denying this now if the evidence wasn’t so strong.’ Miss Thomas said she met Thompson through his cousin two years ago. The couple started dating shortly after the end of his five-year relationship with Miss Davies.

Miss Davies, who is now thought to be in a new relationship, declined to comment.
