Climate change appeared to be out of control in Arizona according to a Fox 10 News weather map this week, which showed temperatures of thousands of degrees in some parts of the state.

Clearly it was a glitch, but presenter Cory McCloskey refused to get hot and bothered about it, calmly telling his viewers to ‘get out while you can’.

The map showed wildly inaccurate temperatures for several areas of the state, including 2960 farenheit for Cave Creek.

McCloskey exclaimed, as the news reporters laughed in the background, that 'steel boils at around that temperature, doesn't it?'

He added: 'There's probably nothing left up there. So don't even bother looting. It's not going to be worth it.’

He continued: ‘Wow, 750 degrees in Gila Bend right now. And 1270 in Awatukee. I'm not authorised to evacuate Ahwatukee but this temperature seems pretty high.

‘Frankly, Wickenburg is a total loss. You might as well get out. Surprise is starting to heat up as well. The safe spots seem to be Chandler and Mesa. But you're surrounded by some pretty intense heat. I'm not your dad, but I would get out. While you still can.'

Weatherman Cory McCloskey was praised for making light of the map temperature errors

A clip of the report was uploaded to YouTube and his coolness under pressure won him many admirers.

Archlorddestin10 said: ‘Good job. Took the error and made it entertaining so people wouldn't get angry.’

Maria Clark, meanwhile, wrote ‘thought he played it off well’ and Antuan Rzenesepa described him as a ‘true professional'.

The hilarious computer error follows a Fox News gaffe of a human nature.

Last November news host Megyn Kelly managed to slip up while introducing Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. 

Kelly managed to pronounce his name correctly the first time around, but when it came to reading out the title of his show - named after himself - she blurted out 'F***abee' instead.

As she made the gaffe, former Republican presidential candidate Mr Huckabee appeared to crack a smile before Mrs Kelly corrected herself.
