Joanne Taylor used to spend frantic hours every day roaming the streets trying to discover her wandering mother’s whereabouts.

Now she need only switch on her computer.

Dementia sufferer Anne Grimshaw, 78, has been fitted with a tracking device nicknamed a ‘SatNan’ because she gets lost so often when out walking.

Anne Grimshaw (right), who has dementia, has been given a tracking device which allows her daughter, Joanne Taylor (left), to find her if she gets lost

The transmitter, known as a Buddi, is attached to her keys and sends out an update on her position every five minutes.

If she wanders too far from her 
bungalow in Rochdale, or suffers a fall, her daughter receives a phone 
call from the Buddi team.

Mrs Taylor said the device, supplied by 
Rochdale Council’s assisted technology department, had enabled the 
great-grandmother to retain her independence rather than having to be 
put in a home.

‘The police once brought her home when
she was found on the hard shoulder of the motorway. She doesn’t think 
there is anything wrong but she gets completely lost.

Ms Taylor says that the device has allowed her mother to avoid having to move into a nursing home

Before they had the device, Ms Taylor says she would have to go out looking for her mother up to five times a day

The black box is attached to Mrs Grimshaw's keys and, as well as tracking her location, it can alert her daughter if she falls over or strays outside a certain area

‘One day she went missing for 12 hours and caused a massive police search. We live near the moors and I was sick with worry.’

Mrs Taylor says others should consider a tracking device for their relatives.

‘There are thousands in my position whose lives would be changed if they knew about Buddi.’

Before she had the tracking device, Mrs Grimshaw (left) was found by police on the hard shoulder of a dual carriageway

‘We live near the moors and I was sick with worry, I can't put into words how I felt, I was really worked up and just kept crying, I thought the worse. She would even try and go out in the snow,’ she said.

Following this incident, a desperate Ms Taylor began researching ways to track her mother - in particular she was looking for a mobile phone with a tracking app - and she came across Buddi.

Ms Taylor said the system worked ‘in the nick of time’.

She explained: ‘My mother’s independence is key to her and I think your independence is just about everything to you especially if you can live in your own home and be in your own surroundings.

‘But you have got to be safe at the same time. I know my mum would hate being in a home and I believe she would have deteriorated. If she didn't have this it would be really dangerous.’

She added: ‘I can't fault Buddi. If she didn't have this then she would not be in her own house but in a home there is no doubt about it.'
