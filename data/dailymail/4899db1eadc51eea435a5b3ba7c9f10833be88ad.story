Commitment: In reply to a question from Labour former home secretary David Blunkett, Damian Green said the Government 'remains committed to the European Convention on Human Rights'

Ministers yesterday admitted they have no plans to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights.

A humiliating court defeat for the Government over its attempts to kick out hate-preacher Abu Qatada has thrown the convention back into the spotlight.

Home Secretary Theresa May and Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant both want to ditch it to make it easier to deport foreign terrorists and criminals.

But Damian Green, justice minister and fellow Conservative, said no plans were being made to do so.

In reply to a question from Labour former home secretary David Blunkett, Mr Green said: ‘As set out in the Coalition agreement, the Government remains committed to the European Convention on Human Rights and has no plans to denounce or withdraw from it.’

Senior opposition figures concede that, as a result of the Qatada case, there is a growing clamour to reform human rights laws.

Mr Blunkett said ministers were in a ‘terrible muddle’, adding: ‘I wish the Government would make their mind up. They either are in favour of Britain’s membership of the ECHR, as incorporated into the Human Rights Act, or they are not.

‘If as their answer indicates, they have no plans in this area, it would be sensible for them to get on with any positive changes they want to make to the interpretation of the convention and how this will be translated into the work of our judges.’

Yesterday Lord Reid, another Labour ex-home secretary, said the longer the debate went on the longer  ‘it undermines the belief in the court system, particularly human rights legislation’.

On Wednesday, the Appeal Court ruled it would be a breach of Qatada’s human rights to send him to Jordan on terror charges, in case evidence used against him came from torture.

Mrs May had secured assurances from the Jordanian government that no torture evidence would be involved. But this was rejected by the courts.

The judges accepted Qatada was ‘very dangerous’ – but said this was ‘not a relevant consideration’ under human rights laws.

In response, Mr Fabricant said on Twitter: ‘We MUST leave the European Convention on Human Rights!’

Tory MP Robert Halfon said: ‘This is a shocking decision. It is an abuse of human rights because it does not take into consideration the human rights of those threatened by terrorism.

‘It is an abuse of Parliament because the judges have defied the clear will of Parliament which is get this man out of the country.’ 

His fellow Tory MP Mark Reckless said the Government had adopted the wrong legal strategy by trying to satisfy the test on torture evidence set down by the European court.

The Law Lords had previously ruled it was safe to deport Qatada. 

The British courts changed their mind only after Mrs May asked them to consider the case again, in wake of the Strasbourg ruling against deportation.

Mr Reckless said there had been a ‘craven surrender to Strasbourg’.

Tory MPs blame Nick Clegg for thwarting all attempts to reform human rights law.

They say Mr Green’s response to Mr Blunkett shows the Tory party is having to bend over backwards to keep the Liberal Democrats happy.

In his weekly LBC radio show, Mr Clegg yesterday said the Government was determined to deport Qatada – but would not ignore the court’s ruling because that would be to act illegally.

The Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘Theresa May has been out to Jordan. She is going to make sure that we strengthen those assurances from the Jordanians.

‘We are absolutely determined as a Government to deport this guy. I wish we could do it earlier, we are having to jump through these endless legal hoops but we will get there.’
