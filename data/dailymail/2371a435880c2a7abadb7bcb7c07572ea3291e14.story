Wanted: Lincoln police were searching for 16-year-old Sarah Piccolol in connection with an attack Monday of a fellow student at Lincoln Pius X High School

Authorities in Nebraska are searching tonight for a 16-year-old student who allegedly slashed another girl in the face with a knife and beat her across the head with a hammer today.

Lincoln police said that Pius X student Sarah Piccolo attacked 17-year-old Ellen Kopetzky in the bathroom of the Catholic high school just before 9.45 a.m. (CDT).

The school immediately went into lock-down following the shocking event and Piccolo is said to have fled the scene in a grey 1992 Buick Park Avenue with Nebraska plate number TJM 557.

Lincoln Police Captain David Beggsconfirmed that a large survival knife was recovered from the bathroom along with a claw hammer and so far, investigators have not speculated on a motive.

'It would be to her benefit to contact us,' Beggs said.

Piccolo is described as 5-foot 5-inches, 105 pounds, with brown hair and her family said that they were terrified for her.

'I’m just scared to death,' Sarah’s father, John Piccolo, said to the Journal Star. 'She’s out driving. She’s scared. She’s running.

'We don’t know where she’s at.'

The family of Ellen Kopetzky confirmed that she had undergone surgery at Bryan West Campus to treat multiple injuries and asked for well-wishers to offer prayers.

'By God's grace, Ellen will recover,' the family said in a statement released Monday evening.

And graciously, the Kopetzky family even asked people to pray for Sarah Piccolo, who has been on the run since Monday morning, following the attack.

'We ask you to join us in prayer for Sarah Piccolo and her family,' 
said a statement from the family of 17-year-old Ellen Kopetzky.

'We pray that she may be treated with respect and with mercy, and that our community will also support her family.'

Following the brutal attack, Pius X was locked down for over two hours while a dozen officers, some armed with assault rifles, made three sweeps of the campus to try and find Piccolo.

Lincoln Police Officer Katie Flood confirmed that Kopetzky was cut across the face and also was struck in the head with a hammer.

One student recalled the frantic vice principal running down the hallway just after being informed of the attack.

Emergency: The victim, Ellen Kopetsky was rushed to hospital after the attack this morning where she underwent surgery

'We were told a student was stabbed,' said Sydney Eddy as she left the school about noon. 'I would say it was rather nerve-racking. It was intense.'

Pius senior Jacob Miller, 17, said he is a friend of the Kopetzky. He told KOLN-TV she was a kind, wonderful classmate.

'I don’t know why anybody would be mad at her,' he said.

Police said that the school's 
surveillance cameras showed Piccolo exiting the school just after the 
assault and driving away in an eastward direction.

Several nearby schools, including East High, Lefler and Mickle middle 
schools and Eastridge, Pyrtle, Maxey, Morley and St. Joseph's elementary
 schools, went into lock-down because of the incident at Pius X.

The 
lockdowns were lifted around 1 p.m.

Kopetzky is currently listed in stable condition in hospital, and her family is with her, according to the Lincoln Diocese.

The
 Rev. Jim Meysenburg, school superintendent, said Piccolo does not have a
 history of disciplinary issues or are they aware of any issues between 
Piccolo and Kopetsky.

Piccolo’s grandmother, June, said her granddaughter has always been a sweet girl.

'I wouldn’t have even thought this possible, because she’s always a quiet girl,' she said to the Journal Star.
