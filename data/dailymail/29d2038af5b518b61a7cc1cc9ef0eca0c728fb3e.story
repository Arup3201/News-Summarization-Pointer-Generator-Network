An American TV network has confirmed an adaptation of a risque British reality series in which troubled couples discuss their relationship issues with a panel of experts before retiring to a box on the show's set to have sex.

Sex Box is being produced by WE tv and will premiere Friday at 10pm.

It is based on the belief that people are more trusting and open in the moments immediately after sex due to the body's natural release of oxytocin, also known as the 'cuddle hormone'.

The show sparked a fair amount controversy upon its debut in the UK in 2013.

The panel of experts includes: Dr. Fran Walfish, a Beverly Hills relationship psychotherapist, Dr. Chris Donaghue,  a  clinical sex therapist, and Dr. Yvonne Capehart,a Florida-based pastor.

'Sex Box is one of the most unique and compelling show concepts we've ever seen, and we can't wait to bring it to WE tv,' Marc Juris, WE tv's president, told TV Grape Vine.

'Our featured couples will get a once-in-a-lifetime experience, while our viewers will get the kind of bold, break-through-the-clutter programming they increasingly associate with WE tv.'

According to the experts, there is an actual science to the format of the show.

'We can’t (usually) be there when [sex] is happening, but with the box, you can,' Dr Donaghue told The New York Post. 

'You’re there when they’re anxious right before and can really map it out, and you’re sitting there when they come out — they’re feeling close, they’re feeling bonded — or the opposite.'

Help: The experts say that straight after sex is when you're at your most open

Fun: The sex is not recorded, however the moment the couple leave the box is 

Box: The show is based on a controversial British series of the same name

There will be 11 hour-long episodes and three couples will be featured.

One couple fear they have lost their spark after being married for 14 years and having four children.

Another share an open relationship, with one wanting to introduce S&M.

Steve Wendell, 26, went on the show with his wife Sasha, 27, thinking they had lost the passion in the marriage after struggling to have children for the last six years.

Sasha said she found the experience sexy and inspiring.

However Steve struggled with the post-coital interview.

'It was really awkward for me, because I was sweating really bad,' he told The Post.
