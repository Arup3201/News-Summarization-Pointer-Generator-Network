No, you're not going quackers, this really is a cloud shaped just like a duck.

After months of fowl weather, spring has sprung, bringing with it blue skies and sunshine... and unusually-shaped cloud formations.

This amazing duck-shaped cumulus cloud was spotted in the blue sky above York by York University student Ben Hopkins, 21, as he walked through the city's Rowntree Park yesterday morning.

Nice weather (not just for ducks): This cloud was spotted in the sky above York by student Ben Hopkins, 21

The History and Politics student said: 'I was pretty surprised when I looked up and saw it.

'In films you see clouds looking like things but you don't expect to see it in real life.'

Last autumn, retired GP Margaret Worrall spotted a cloud shaped just like an elephant as she walked her dogs along the banks of the River Forth in Scotland.

Cumulus clouds are a type of low-level cloud known for their puffy shapes and clearly-defined edges.

The Met Office said much of the UK should stay dry today and tomorrow, with rain only forecast in parts of Scotland and the far southwest of England.Â  Thursday and Friday will be breezy and cloudy with some drizzle at times.
