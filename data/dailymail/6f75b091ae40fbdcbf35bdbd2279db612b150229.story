A group of axe-wielding women are making a name for themselves in the world of competitive wood chopping.

Axe Women founder, Alissa Harper, recruited a Zumba dance instructor, a massage therapist and a grandmother of two to compete in competitions and shows around America.

Their shows include axe throwing, underhand chopping, log rolling, and sawing through 19 inches of pine wood.

Ordinarily Chelsey Black is a massage therapist, but in her spare time she likes nothing more than to chop through large logs

Ms Harper, 34, said: 'People think lumberjacks are just big, burly men - but they're surprised when we get out of the truck and all my girls are beautiful and feminine.

'All my ladies compete at the World Championships, and that's where I choose my members from.'

She started the group five years ago after working for a lumberjack show near her home in Maine, USA.

She said: 'I just bought all the equipment and the truck and got some sponsors - now I have more work than I know what to do with.'

The Axe Women come from different backgrounds, but all share a passion for the rugged sport.

Grandmother of two Andrea Robarge, 45, from New York,  said her husband and children are all fans of the competitive jumberjacking 

Member Tracie Henning, 34, from New York, said: 'I could have my girly side when I shake my hips and dance, but then I also have this side of me where I can get dirty and chop and saw.

'I'm a zumba dance instructor, but being a member of Axe Women is my alter ego - I can walk around and be a badass with an axe, and then I can go and get my nails done and tan.

'I recently broke a world record for sawing through pine wood in 21.99 seconds, and it felt amazing.'

Like most members of the team, massage therapist Chelsey Black, 24, was first introduced to the sport in college.

Ms Black, from New York, said: 'I don't really fit the standards of what someone expects a lumberjack to look like - they say I look like a Barbie doll.

'I have callouses on my hands from lifting weights and lumberjack sports, but it makes me stronger which is great because I can do deep tissue massages.

'People look for a male to do those deep massages but I can put a lot of pressure down.

'It's a nice conversation starter if I have male clients because we can talk about chainsaws - it makes me more approachable and down-to-earth.'

The four women have all competed competitively at the lumberjack world championships and travel around performing demonstrations 

For grandmother-of-two, Andrea Robarge, from New York, timber sports is a family affair.

Mrs Robarge, 45, said: 'My husband and children do it - we are the lumberjack family.

'Not many people can say they're a lumberjack grandma at my age - but it's when we spend our family time together.'

And while the ladies practice with their sharp tools, accidents sometimes happen.

She added: 'I've had to have surgery because I've cut my hand with a cross-cut saw, and I've had to have my thumb sewed back together.'

The Axe Women hope to encourage other ladies who share a similar passion for timber sports.

'I've been doing this for about 27 years and I've seen so many people come and go. I'm hoping in the future there will be a lot more women in the sport.'
