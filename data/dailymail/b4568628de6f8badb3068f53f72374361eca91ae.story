Thanks to Glenn Beck, the prospectus for Disneyland has been released to the public for the first time ever, after the polarizing television and radio host won them in an auction earlier this year.

The plans, which Walt Disney and his brother Roy used to raise the $17 million required to build the park, show a park that looks remarkably similar to the one today.

Drawn in 1953, two years before the park opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955, the map lays out popular attraction such as Tomorrowland, Main Street and Sleeping Beauty's castle.

The brothers describe the park by saying, 'Like Alice stepping Through the Looking Glass, to step through the portals of DISNEYLAND will be like entering another world.'

Of course, not all of Disney's ideas for the park  came to fruition.

The Kaiser Aluminum Hall of Fame was a corporate-sponsored attraction that would show how aluminum was made, and eventually became part of Tomorrowland when the park opened in July of 1955.

Lilliputian Land, which was inspired by Gulliver's Travels, would have featured 9-inch-tall singing and dancing mechanical people living in a miniature American town.

The main attractions of this land would have been a ride on a 17-inch-tall locomotive and a barge that took visitors though the canals of the world, according to pages released on Boing Boing.

The park would become so successful upon its opening, that ten years later, Disney developed the idea to build four more parks in Florida.

Unfortunately, he passed away of lung cancer in 1967 before he could see any of them completed.

Magic Kingdom, the first of the four, opened to the public in 1971.
