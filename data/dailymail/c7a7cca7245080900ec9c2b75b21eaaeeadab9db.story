Jordon Ibe is hoping to make a timely return to Liverpool's squad before the end of the season after stepping up his rehabilitation from a knee ligament injury.

Ibe was ruled out for six weeks after limping out of the Europa League defeat at Besiktas last month with knee ligament damage.

The 19-year-old, who has made a big impression on the first team squad, has only this week resumed running at Melwood.

Liverpool are already without the suspended Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel while Daniel Sturridge is also expected to be out for three weeks with a torn hip flexor muscle.

Asked if he expects to play again this season, Ibe said: 'Yes, hopefully. It was the ligament on the side of my knee and they said I could be out for six to eight weeks, but everything has gone smoothly from here and hopefully I can crack on now and get back in action.

'They (Liverpool) have not said anything to me yet but if I can just keep doing my rehab in the gym and in the swimming pool I can get back to training quickly.'

Liverpool will look to pick themselves up after defeat to Manchester United when they travel to Arsenal next weekend and Ibe believes Champions League qualification is still in their reach.

'Hopefully we can get top four or even higher. Although they have lost a game they are still on a high. We need to keep building from there and picking up points.

'I’m enjoying everything right now, hopefully I can get back and continue playing. I didn’t think I’d play as much as I had. It’s been terrific so far so hopefully I can keep at that and impress the gaffer.'
