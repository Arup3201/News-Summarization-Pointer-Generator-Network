Talented: Student Nicole Westbrook had only moved to Seattle three weeks ago when she was shot in the neck on Sunday morning

An art student has been left fighting for life after being gunned down in a 'random act of violence' as she left a comedy night with her boyfriend.

Nicole Westbrook was just yards from her home in Pioneer Square, Seattle, when she was hit in the neck on Sunday morning while heading to her apartment with her partner.

The 21-year-old, who is now on a life support machine, had only moved to the city three weeks ago to study at a local art institute.

Her devastated boyfriend, Bryant Griffin, has now described the moment became an 'innocent victim' when she was gunned down at around 2a.m on Sunday.

Mr Griffin told Washington's Most Wanted: 'Everyone on the street dove to the ground, and I thought that's what she was doing, but everyone started getting back up and she didn't.'

The pair had recently moved to Seattle from Albuquerque and were walking home from a night out at a nearby comedy club.

Mr Griffin added: 'It was like the happiest I've seen her in a couple weeks... just because we've been struggling financially, just to get started, and not having much at the beginning.'

Police said Nicole was gunned down after shots were fired from a passing vehicle in the early hours of Sunday.

Detectives added that a smaller, light-coloured vehicle seen fleeing the scene shortly after could be connected to the shooting.

It is thought the 'cowardly' shooter had been aiming at the sidewalk Nicole was walking on when she was struck in the neck.

Police in Seattle have vowed to hunt down the person behind the shooting, after lamenting the gun violence which is 'permeating our city and this great nation'.

Nicole's family have also pleaded for anyone with information on the shooting to come forward.

Her aunt, Joyce Esquer, told a media conference: 'There's no honour in what this individual has done. There's no honour in silence.

'We believe there are sister and brothers, daughters and sons, who know this person or who have information about who shot Nicole.

'We ask you to come forward and share this information with the police.'

Tragically, Facebook posts have revealed that the shooting is the latest trauma Nicole has had to endure.

In 2005 her father died in Afghanistan after being struck by an IED, while her uncle also died four years later while serving in the military.

Seattle Police Chief John Diaz said: 'Some coward with a gun used it with tragic results.

'It's our job — the police department and community — to get together and help put this person in prison, help put a stop to this gun violence that's permeating our city and this great nation.'
