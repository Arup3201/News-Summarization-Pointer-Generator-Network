Dale Wynne, 55, from Five Roads, near Llanelli, West Wales, died on the A370 at Bristol

A boyfriend died after crashing the BMW convertible which he had bought for his girlfriend as a surprise present. 

Dale Wynne, from Five Roads, near Llanelli, West Wales, was driving on the A370 Long Ashton bypass near Bristol when the sports car came off the road.

It smashed through trees and a large sign before landing on its roof. Mr Wynne was prounounced dead at the scene.  

The 55-year-old had been doing up the car since February for Gillian Birthwright, 45, his partner of eight years.

He was taking it for a test drive when the crash took place. He was never able to give Ms Birthwright the surprise present.

She said: 'When I got the call I didn't believe it as his car was with me, but it turns out he had bought the BMW in February and may have been doing it up for me as he knew I liked fast cars.

'He had been an undertaker and dealt with many car crashes so was always a really careful driver.

'He was my world and meant everything to me. I have no idea how I will carry on without him.'

Mr Wynne worked in Bristol during the week as a building facilities manager but his girlfriend said they would speak ten times a day.    

The couple had been due to move into a new house together the day after he died.

They shared a passion for abandoned pets and worked in their spare time to rehome dogs. The father-of-two had helped save 160 pets during his life, working alongside Ms Birthwright.

She said: 'He was always bubbly, with a great sense of humour. He was just a jolly chap, with a twinkle in his eye.

'He looked after me so well and this has left me devastated. It still hasn't fully sunk in.

'We laughed together, every day, and would shed tears together too. He was much-loved and will be sorely missed.' 

Mr Wynne loved country singing and had travelled around Britain performing when he was younger.

The couple moved to Five Roads two-and-a-half years ago where they quickly got into re-homing abandoned dogs.

Mr Wynne leaves behind children Ryan and Trish, and Gillian's children Michael and Sheryl and her grandchildren Katie and Amie.
