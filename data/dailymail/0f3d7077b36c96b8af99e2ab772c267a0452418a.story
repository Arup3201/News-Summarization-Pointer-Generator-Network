Horrifying new footage was seen for the first time today of the moment a barge slammed into a tour boat drowning two college students.

Dora Schwendtner, 16, and Szabolcs Prem,
20, died when a barge collided with a 
duck boat on the Delaware River in July 2010, causing 37 people to be thrown into the water.

The video - released days before a wrongful death suit goes to court - shows the 80-yard-long barge moving toward the duck boat, which had broken down, and then driving over the smaller vessel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Horror on the river: Two students died when the tourist boat they were travelling in on the Delaware River in Philadelphia was crushed by a barge

Distracted: The guide on the duck boat tour stand at the front texting as a barge plows towards the broken down vessel

Moments before the fatal collision, in the footage obtained by NBC, the deckhand on the duck boat appears to be engrossed in his cell phone sending a text message.

Attorneys for the parents of the two Hungarian foreign exchange students who died released the tape days before a civil wrongful death lawsuit goes to federal court.

The tour leader can be seen leaping from the vessel as those on board, none wearing their orange life jackets, flail around in terror.

Attorneys for the victims' families have
said the vessel lacked an emergency air horn and radio and had overhead
canopies that trapped the two victims underwater when the boat 
capsized.

They also say passengers were not made to wear life preservers until moments before the crash.

Dora Schwendtner, 16, and Szabolcs 
Prem, 20, were killed on July 7 when the barge slammed into the boat about 150 feet from the shore.

The 35 other tourists survived when pulled from the fast-moving current by firefighters and a passing ferry boat.

Miss Schwendtner and Mr Prem were both described as strong swimmers by their families.Â 

They were touring the U.S. with their high school through a church-sponsored exchange program.

The video, which shows 
the impact of the barge and tour boat from the New Jersey side 
of the river, was part of the official record compiled by the National 
Transportation Safety Board who investigated the crash.

The families have filed a wrongful 
death lawsuit against K-Sea Transportation of East Brunswick which 
operated the tugboat guiding the barge.

They were also suing Ride the Ducks of Norcross, Georgia, which operated the 
tour boat and the city of Philadelphia which owned the barge.

Negligence: The driver of the tugboat which was guiding the barge was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter

Before the lawsuits can proceed, a judge will hear arguments next week 
on whether maritime law should limit the liabilities of the operators of
both vessels.

In November, tug pilot Matthew Devlin of Catskill, New York, was sentenced to a year in prison after pleading guilty to the maritime equivalent of involuntary manslaughter.

Prosecutors said he was distracted by calls on his cell phone relating to a family emergency and moved to a part of the tug that blocked his view of the river.

The safety board said in its 4,400-page report of the crash that the duck boat overheated on the 103-degree day because someone left a radiator cap off.

The captain mistakenly thought the steam was an engine fire and anchored the boat in the busy channel.
