There was mayhem in Talladega on Sunday as 25 cars were caught up in a huge crash on the final lap of NASCAR’s Good Sam 500.

With the drivers racing at speeds of up to 200mph and in such a tight space on the circuit, the crash seemed an inevitability.

But the racers managed to avoid serious disaster until the fourth turn of the 188th lap – the final one of the day - when 25 cars were caught up in the crash, caused by Tony Stewart. 

Over he goes: Tony Stewart (No 14) battles to keep control of his car, but can do nothing to prevent it overturning

A clean set of wheels: Stewart had been leading the race before Matthew Waltrip clipped his rear bumper

Back down to earth: As Stewart's car slid on its side, a 25-car pile-up was created

Stewart, who was leading the race, tried to avoid the takeover attempt by Michael Waltrip. But the pursuing driver clipped Stewart’s bumper, sending him ploughing into several other cars.

Stewart’s car then flipped over as 24 other cars were dragged into the collision.

The No 14 car slid towards the barriers surrounding the track, taking out the other cars in the process as screeching tyres and clouds of smoke filled the arena.

It was all part of the spectacle for the baying NASCAR fans, as many roared and cheered as the cars slid and careered into one another.

Matt Kenseth, who was higher up on 
the track at the time of the crash, was able to avoid the carnage and 
slipped by unscathed to win the race ahead of Jeff Gordon and Kyle 
Busch.

Gordon and Busch 
were nose-to-tail behind Stewart when the crash happened, but were 
somehow able to round the carnage to finish the race.

Races
at the Talladega and Daytona Speedway are run with restrictor plates 
which limit the speed of the cars, but that wasn’t enough to prevent the
‘big wreck’ on Sunday.

Luckily, no one was seriously injured in the crash after the cars ground to a halt and the flames were extinguished.

Before the mayhem: The cars move at great speed in close proximity to one another

Not for the first time: Jamie McMurray (No 1) spun off the track before the massive wreck in the final lap

Stewart, who had tried to block out his opponents in the final lap to seal the victory, took full responsibility for the crash and said: 'I just screwed up.'

Driver Dale Earnhardt Jr was shocked after the huge pile-up, and believes that the close proximity of the cars was a contributing factor.

He said: 'It’s not safe. It’s not. It’s bloodthirsty. If that’s what people want, that’s ridiculous.'

'If this is what we did every week, I wouldn't be doing it,' Earnhardt said. 'I'd find another job. ... You can't get away from each other. It's obvious. How many cars were in that wreck? And that's OK with everybody?

'I don't even want to go to Talladega or Daytona next year, but I got no choice.'

Earnhardt Jr's team-mate, Gordon, echoed his views and said: 'That literally is bumper cars almost at 200 miles an hour, and I don't know anybody who likes that.'

Loving it: Fans can be spotted cheering as the cars continue to slide across the track

The real deal: The drivers managed to complete 188 laps before the huge crash took place

Just a scratch: Jimmie Johnson managed to drive across the finish line after wrecking his car

‘I've gained a little bit of patience over the years,’ said Kenseth. ‘And I had to be patient two or three times.’

‘I saw Tony's back bumper and I saw him getting spun out,’ he added. ‘I don't know how that happened or how he got in that position, but I saw him spinning out and then when we were clear of him.’

After Gordon and Busch, David Ragan and Regan Smith were fourth and fifth respectively.

Jimmie Johnson even managed to cross the finish line with smoke rising from his battered car after being caught up in the wreck.
