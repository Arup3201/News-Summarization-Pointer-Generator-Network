This never-before-seen Victorian photograph shows the real rabbit who inspired Beatrix Potter's famous character Benjamin Bunny.

The adorable pet, named Benjamin Bouncer before his literary transformation, lived with Ms Potter from 1885 until he died in 1892.

He would would not appear in her novels until 1904, but the Belgian rabbit - one of several she owned - clearly left a lasting impression.

Inspiration: Benjamin Bouncer is pictured here in the late 1880s or early 1890s. He would later become Benjamin Bunny in Beatrix Potter's novels

He was supposed to feature in The Tale of Peter Rabbit - the first book in the series, from 1902, but was later edited out before starring in The Tale of Benjamin Bunny two years later.

The author gave the photograph to the children of Joseph Mott, who was the art director at Royal Doulton, a pottery company which had been modelling characters from her tales.

She wrote on the back of the picture 
postcard: 'For Mr. Motts children - This is a photograph of the real old
 original Mr Benjamin Bunny - he was a Belgian rabbit, very tame & 
clever.'

It has been suggested that Ms Potter's father Rupert may have taken the picture rather than the author herself, as Mr Potter was known to have an interest in photography.

Message: Ms Potter wrote this postcard to the children of Mr Mott, whose descendants have now sold it

The 5.5ins by 3.5in card has now been sold for Â£1,100 by a descendant in the Mott family at Dominic Winter Auctioneers in Cirencester, Gloucestershire.

Libby Joy, chairman of the Beatrix Potter Society, said: 'Benjamin Bouncer was a Belgian rabbit and was the first of Beatrix Potter's pet rabbits.

'He was acquired in about 1885. She brought him home from a London pet shop and brought him home in a paper bag.

Iconic: Beatrix Potter's elegant watercolours of her beloved rabbits, such as the one pictured, helped make her books an enduring success

Owner: Beatrix Potter, pictured, spoke warmly of 'the real old original Mr Benjamin Bunny'

'We think the photograph on the postcard was taken by Beatrix herself, though it could have been taken by her father, who was a prolific photographer.

'We know quite a lot about Benjamin because Beatrix wrote about him in her Journal, and he was the model for most of the rabbits in her early published work in the 1890s - greetings cards and so on - that predated the little books.'

In The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, the title character joins his cousin Peter Rabbit to return to Mr McGregor's garden and look for the clothes Peter left there in the first book.

During the risky escapade, the two bunnies become trapped under a basket by Mr McGregor's cat and have to be rescued by Benjamin's father.
