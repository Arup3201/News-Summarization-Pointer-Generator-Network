A Utah man driving a motorboat on Lake Powell was apparently distracted by his young passengers when he hit a houseboat and flipped the craft, leaving his wife dead and his daughter and his son's girlfriend missing, deputies said.

Adrian Jackman, 59, of South Jordan, apparently tried to swerve when he noticed the moving houseboat but hit the front corner, authorities said.

The accident that happened at around 8am Thursday killed his wife, Marilyn Jackman, 57. His daughter, Jessica Jackman, 22, and his son's girlfriend, Valerie Rae Bradshaw, 29, of Sandy, Utah, are missing in the water.

Crews brought a robot equipped with a camera to search for the missing women Friday in the 400-foot-deep water near Dangling Rope Marina. But they ran into technical problems and had to call off the effort, according to Denise Shultz, spokeswoman for the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area that encompasses Lake Powell.

She said the Utah Highway Patrol has been asked to bring in equipment from the Salt Lake City area, and the search is expected to resume Saturday.

Most of the people aboard the motorboat, which was carrying 13 passengers, were family members from northern Utah, deputies said. Nobody on the houseboat was injured.

It's not uncommon for boaters to venture out early in the morning while the waters of Lake Powell are smooth, said Kane County sheriff's Sgt. Alan Alldredge.

The vast man-made lake, bordered 
by sandstone walls and colorful rock formations, is a popular 
destination for houseboat vacations.

Deputies
 said the group was headed to Rainbow Bridge — touted as the largest 
known natural bridge in the world — when the crash happened. Crews had 
to rescue some victims from the water, Shultz said.

All
 of the six children aboard were wearing life jackets, officials said. 
Adrian Jackman and his 11-year-old granddaughter were airlifted to a 
hospital in Flagstaff, Ariz., while a third person was taken to the 
hospital by ambulance.

The Jackmans' family and friends in the town of South Jordan were left reeling from the news of the tragedy.

The
 crash happened in a channel a couple of hundred yards wide in Lake 
Powell. Police believe the driver may have looked away from where he was
 headed after a child moved from the front to the back of the boat, KSL said.

Alan Alldredge, from Kane County Sheriff's Department, said that as someone yelled 'Boat' the driver looked up to see a houseboat in their path.

As he tried to swerve, Jackman clipped the houseboat with enough force to throw his 12 passengers overboard.

Police confirmed the six children on board had been wearing life jackets.

A dive team searched for the missing women until 7pm last night. The search will resume tomorrow. .

The water in Lake Powell is about 400ft deep at the crash site, according to Center Daily News. Rescue teams may have to use sonar equipment to find the women.

'This time of year, the lake can get busy and these kinds of accidents, even though they’re not rare, they do have a great potential for happening out there,' Mr Alldredge said.
