Thibaut Courtois has lauded Chelsea's medical team for the way they treated him after he sustained a head injury against Arsenal.

The 22-year-old goalkeeper had to be replaced in the 24th minute by Petr Cech during Chelsea's 2-0 win against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge last Sunday.

Courtois, who recovered from his knock to feature in Belgium's 6-0 win against Andorra, singled out Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro for special praise.

Never underestimate a head injury

'Two points are important in head injuries: firstly, you may have suffered a concussion. Secondly, if you have, the crucial question is when you can safely return to play.

'A concussion is a brain injury that is feared because it may affect your memory, concentration problem-solving and more. In real life, it is not at all easy to recognise that you have suffered a concussion. 

'Contrary to common belief, you do not need to have lost consciousness to suffer concussion. You may be confused or unaware of the time, date or place for a while after the injury, or you may have headache, dizziness, nausea and unsteadiness/loss of balance.'

Speaking to Sky Sports, Courtois said: 'The doctor of Chelsea did well, I think. She asked me the questions she needed to ask and I could repeat immediately so I was feeling well and didn’t have to come off.

'I didn’t feel I was knocked out but I was hit. 

'I didn’t have a headache or anything, but after a few minutes I felt worse and worse.

'Then I started to feel a little dizzy and I couldn’t see the ball anymore, and there was a little blood coming from my ear. 

'Because I saw trouble, I went off.

'I know you have to be careful, but I was not really knocked out.'

The former Genk custodian revealed he was 'a little confused' after the events at Stamford Bridge and was suffering from neck pains, dizziness and headaches but was passed fit to play after undergoing neurological tests.
