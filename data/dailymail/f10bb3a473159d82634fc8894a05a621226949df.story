Boris Johnson has claimed it is part of human nature to have a fear of immigrants and that having such feelings 'doesn't make you a bad person'.

The Mayor of London said it was up to politicians to highlight the benefits immigrants bring to the UK and has urged the Government for a 'welcoming policy' for those who choose to come to the country.

His comments come after the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby described immigration in Britain as a 'great tradition'.

The Mayor has just concluded a week-long tour to the Far East as part of a UK Trade and Industry mission

Speaking after a week-long tour of the Far East as part of a UK Trade and Industry mission, Mr Johnson, 50, said it was natural to feel xenophobic on occasion. 

The 50-year-old told the Evening Standard: 'All human beings are prey to that feeling.

'It's part of human nature. It doesn't mean people are bad people, okay?

'What we've got to do is point out that there are benefits of immigration and that there are benefits of having talented people, and having a welcoming policy to people that will work hard.'

He also described the benefits of immigrants to the UK housing market and said it is good that international investors can help support the industry because Britain is 'not awash with billionaires of our own'.

His comments came after the Archbishop called immigration a 'great tradition' but warned it needed to be 'handled carefully'.

Mr Welby, who spoke from Vatican City, said that despite the UK being a 'very, very crowded country', the tradition of welcoming immigrant communities stretched back hundreds of years.

He said that while immigration is 'deeply embedded in our tradition of hospitality', it should be 'handled carefully' because of the 'strain on communities'.

In a rare interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Mr Welby said: 'England, is a very, very crowded country.

'Since 2010, we've had net immigration of over 600,000 people.

'And immigration is something that has to be handled carefully, because it is a cause of strain in communities where very large numbers arrive. Always has been.

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby today described immigration in Britain as a 'great tradition'

'There's an amazing chapel in Canterbury Cathedral in which the dean of the cathedral gave a space for worship to Huguenot refugees from religious persecution in the 16th century.

'He gave it to them temporarily. It's still there. They still have a Sunday service every week.

'It is the great tradition, secondly, of this country to be a place of asylum and safety and rescue and hope for people from all around the world. It is deeply embedded in our tradition of hospitality.' 

Mr Johnson has just concluded a week-long tour of the Far East as part of attempts to boost trade and investment between the UK and Far East.

During his trip, the senior Conservative met politicians, including Indonesian president Joko Widodo, and a raft of business leaders  in Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia.

He was the first British politician to have a substantial meeting with President Widodo since his inauguration. 

Earlier this week, he also met Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri Mohammad Najib Abdul Razak.

The south east Asian country now has an economy worth £153billion ($241bn) and is predicted to reach developed economy status within the next six years.

Following newly introduced legislations which liberate Malaysia's architecture and engineering sectors, Mr Johnson said British businesses should take advantage of what is on offer.

Earlier this week, Mr Johnson, 50, met Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri Mohammad Najib Abdul Razak

'This fast developing nation is awash with new and exciting trade and investment opportunities crying out for London's great minds and expertise,' he said.

'From great new feats of transport engineering to cutting edge design and architectural projects, I urge more British companies to get involved.'

Mr Johnson, running for a return to Parliament in May, also defended the levels of affordable housing in the Malaysian-backed Battersea Power Station redevelopment.

He said the 'affordable' element of the project, 15 per cent of the 3,000-plus properties, represented a gain of 600 discounted homes for Londoners.

Mr Johnson said: 'It's with that spearhead of Malaysian money coming in and redeveloping Battersea Power Station that we are able to get on and build 25,000 homes, the majority of which will be for people in the UK and loads of which will be affordable.

'Plus we are able to get the extension of the northern line...don't forget that out of this development we have got to fund the first extension of the tube we have seen in 25 years, it's not a cheap thing to do.

'We have to build two new stations and it will produce as I say overall in the area 25,000 new homes.

'I think 600 affordable homes is better than no affordable homes.' 

Mr Johnson was caught up in a  mid-air scuffle during the return flight from Kuala Lumpur after a passenger had to be restrained at 35,000 feet. The Mayor joined efforts to restrain the man who was later arrested

Mr Johnson's defence of the project came after he met Prime Minister Razak in Kualar Lumpur to unveil Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) as the architects designing Malaysia Square, the £8bn main public space at the power station project. 

The London Mayor returned from his week-long tour this morning, although his journey back to the capital was not without drama. 

He was caught up in a dramatic mid-air scuffle during the return flight from Kuala Lumpur after an abusive passenger had to be restrained at 35,000 feet.

The Mayor, a passenger on the flight which was destined for London's Heathrow, joined efforts to restrain the man who was described as 'off his head' by one of Mr Johnson's delegation. 

A spokesman for the Mayor told the MailOnline: 'The Mayor along with a number of other passengers and members of the cabin crew did make several attempts to calm the gentleman concerned but to no avail.'

The incident occurred at about 5.40am and the man, who is believed to be British, was detained by police officers when the 13 hour Malaysia Air flight landed at Heathrow.

Met Police confirmed the man was arrested on suspicion of being drunk aboard an aircraft and common assault involving a member of the cabin crew. He was being held in custody at a west London police station this morning.
