The Bishop of Shrewsbury referred to John Lennon's poignant song in a Christmas homily

John Lennon’s anthem Imagine is a ‘heart-chilling vision’ that has misled the world about the causes of war, a senior Roman Catholic bishop said yesterday.(Mon)

Lennon’s song is just a lazy repetition of the ‘ill-founded belief’ that religion causes wars, the Bishop of Shrewsbury, the Right Reverend Mark Davies, said.

But the wars of the 20th century were inspired by secular and anti-Christian ideologies, the Bishop said.

He condemned the 1971 Lennon song in a Christmas homily calling for recognition of the Christian nature of the festival at a time when, he said, schools, public officials and state institutions are trying to sweep away any connection between religion and seasonal celebrations.

The former Beatle’s immensely popular song calls on its listeners to imagine a world with no religion where everyone lives in peace.

Bishop Davies said that the First World War Christmas 1914 truce between British and German soldiers ‘is universally recognised as a brief moment of humanity amidst the death and destruction of the Great War.’

He added: ‘The events of Christmas 1914 give the lie to the lazily repeated assertion that religion is the cause of wars.

‘John Lennon would give voice to this ill-founded belief in the lyrics of his song Imagine. This becomes a heart-chilling vision in which Lennon imagines a world with no hope of heaven and no fear of hell. And, he adds, “no religion too”.

‘Only then, he suggests, will “all the people” be “living life in peace”.

‘Yet the fact is, the wars of the century past, bringing with them atrocities on a scale never seen before, were largely inspired by secularist and, indeed, anti-Christian ideologies. In reality, it is human sin which lies at the root cause of war.’

Bishop Davies, 55, who has led the Shrewsbury diocese since 2010, added: ‘In Britain today we are told that two thirds of schools now substitute a “winter celebration” for the nativity story; civil servants, it is reported, are advised not to use the word Christmas to avoid giving offence; and most civic authorities limit themselves to voicing merely “seasonal greetings”.

‘How much we need to be reminded on this Christmas 2014 that the greatest message for peace and the cohesion of society is being lost amongst us,’ the bishop said.

The Right Reverend Mark Davies referred to the song as well as the Christmas Truce in 1914 for the service

Bishop Davies is regarded as a firm supporter of traditionalist values among the Roman Catholic bishops of England and Wales.

In 2012 he said in his Christmas message that same-sex marriage was an attempt to undermine marriage and religion in the name of progress. 

This he said, was similar to the way that Nazis and communists rejected religion in the name of progress.

The Lennon song – once described by its author as ‘virtually the Communist Manifesto’ - remains a revered highlight of pop history, and Rolling Stone magazine has rated it at number three among the 500 greatest songs of all time.

John Lennon was shot dead by a fan in December 1980. The record producer who worked on Imagine, Phil Spector, is currently serving a prison sentence of 19 years to life for the murder of an aspiring actress in 2003.
