Court: Lavinia Desuze's son Darrell killed Richard Mannington Bowes during the London riots and she, pictured, is accused of perverting the course of justice by hampering the police investigation into his death

The mother of a teenage thug who killed a pensioner in last summer’s riots tried to cover it up by destroying his clothes, a court heard yesterday.

Lavinia Desuze is alleged to have shredded the distinctive T-shirt her 16-year-old son Darrell was wearing when he attacked 68-year-old Richard Mannington Bowes.

Mr Bowes was trying to put out a fire near his home in Ealing, West London, when he was punched by looter Darrell Desuze and fractured his skull on the pavement. He died in hospital three days later.

Yesterday, Inner London Crown Court heard that Desuze, 31, cut up the T-shirt after spotting her son wearing it during a TV appeal for help in finding the killer.

It is claimed she later told police she had dumped it  in bins behind a shop and near a motorway, but when officers searched them they had already been emptied.Darrell, now 17, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, violent disorder and burglary last week.

Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: ‘She knew he had been involved in killing Mr Bowes. Unlike others who turned in their own children, horrified at what they had seen them do, this defendant sought to prevent him from facing the justice he deserved.’

Desuze, from Hounslow, West London, denies perverting the course of justice.

A ‘deliberate and deadly’ blow was landed 
by Desuze on 
the 68-year-old retired accountant, who was trying to quell a fire 
started by a rampaging mob near his home.

Left with brain damage he never awoke and died three days later.

The photograph of Mr Mannington Bowes' unconscious body lying on the pavement became one of the most shocking images of last summer's riots.

Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said Darrell, who went on to loot several shops after attacking him, was wearing a ‘Robbers and Villains’ top, white patterned T-shirt and Adidas bag that night.

'After his arrival home but before the police came knocking on their door, almost a week later on Sunday August 14 this defendant, we suggest, knowing what her son had been involved, took the distinctive items of clothing he had been wearing that night and having cut them up disposed of them,' he told the jury.

'The prosecution say there was only one reason why she did what she did. She realised the distinctive articles of clothing would lead to not only to her son’s identification but also to him facing justice for what he had done.'

Inner London Crown Court heard prior to her and her son’s arrest a 22-year-old man had been detained by police on suspicion of Mr Bowe’s murder after being wrongly identified on the CCTV.

When the Met arrived at her home in Hounslow, west London, she is alleged to have said: 'You’ve got the bloke that did it. Why are you here for my son?'

Ms Desuze admitted her son had been in Ealing that night but claimed he had tried to help Mr Bowes, allegedly saying: 'He was there when he was punched. My son helped that man. He put him in the recovery position.'

But Mr Altman said she later told police she had cut the clothes her son had been wearing up and put them in two bins, one round the back of a shop and another near the A4.

She even agreed to take officers there to show them but when they arrived the bins had been already been emptied, the court heard.

The prosecutor told jurors: 'You can conclude this defendant was deliberately lying to cover up for her son.'

In a later outburst in a police car following her arrest Mr Altman said Lavinia blamed police for Mr Bowes death by sparking off the riots with the shooting of Mark Duggan, saying: 'Police can kill someone and get away with it. But a man died after being attacked in the riots, not murder, and the whole force is out.'

Her son Darrell was originally charged with murder but this was dropped to manslaughter after the Crown Prosecution Service accepted his plea on that basis. He also pleaded guilty to violent disorder and burglary.

Desuze had already been on a looting spree when he encountered Mr
Mannington Bowes who was trying to quell the flames being set by 
rioters.

There was a stand-off between police and
rioters on Spring Bridge Road in Ealing at the time of the tragedy and 
around 70 youths were lobbing missiles at officers.

As Mr Mannington Bowes remonstrated with
the group and tried to stamp out a fire in a bin Desuze punched 
him in the face and he fell smashing his head on the pavement.

Mr Altman added: 'Because of her actions this defendant is charged with perverting the course of justice by concealing or destroying her son’s clothing, the Robbers and Villains top, the patterned white T-shirt and the distinctive Adidas bag, items which, say the prosecution, she knew would rightly point the finger of guilt at her son.

'She knew he had been in Ealing. She knew he had been involved in killing Mr Bowes so in order to prevent any link with this crime she got rid of it all for one reason and one reason only, to obstruct the course of justice.'
