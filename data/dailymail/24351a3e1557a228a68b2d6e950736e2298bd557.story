A wild police chase in Washington ended bizarrely when a man crashed a stolen RV into several cars and a home then got out of the vehicle and stripped to his underwear before running into a home and donning female clothing.

Snohomish County deputies say 33-year-old James M Johns was spotted driving a motor home that had been reported stolen early Tuesday morning at a Walmart in South Everett.

Everett police, Washington State Patrol troopers and Snohomish deputies were all involved in an hour-long chase after repeated attempts to pull Johns over failed.

Suspect: James Johns, 33, was arrested after leading police on a wild chase and crashing into cars and homes

Wild chase: The RV was reported stolen Tuesday morning and spotted that afternoon, when a chase involving up to 20 police vehicles ensued

Damage: This car was mangled after Johns hit it with the SUV, setting off a chain reaction of crashes

The 
out-of-control driver reportedly swerved into the path of an oncoming 
police car, narrowly missing it, and almost hit a jogger and three girls
 with a horse.

Johns
 eventually drove the vehicle to Granite Falls, where it slammed into a 
car, which in turn launched another car into the front of Gary Poplin's 
home.

'I'm just glad it hit the telephone pole first otherwise I wouldn't have a bedroom,' Poplin told Kiro TV.

The
 RV didn't stop there. It hit another car and broke through Poplin's 
fence before taking out the corner of Juliane Rowell's home and smashing
 three more cars.

Lucky escape: The driver of one of the vehicles Johns hit was taken to hospital with injuries but police say no one was seriously hurt

Damage: The fence of this home was mowed down by Johns in the RV, and the home was also damaged

Rowell says she was upstairs when the incident happened.

'Then my son started yelling, "Mom, Mom, you can't believe this:Â  someone ran into our house!"' she told Kiro TV.

After the RV finally came to a stop, witnesses say Johns jumped out and began running, shedding clothing as he went.

He ran into a home in his underwear, encountered a group of people inside and demanded they give him clothing to disguise himself from the police.

They refused and ran outside before calling the police.

Out of control: Johns reportedly hit a car which ran into a telephone pole before hitting Gary Poplin's home

Neighborhood in shock: All in all, five cars and two houses were damaged in Johns's rampage

Deputies were not far away and arrived just moments later.

'He had about 15 or 20 cop cars chasing him,' a witness told KOMO.

Deputies removed Johns from the house, reports Kiro TV, where he had managed to don a pair of women's jeans and a women's T-shirt.

'He started putting on girl clothes,' one witness told KOMO. 'And then the cops came and grabbed him and brought him out and he was still wearing the girl clothes.'

One motorist was injured in the series of crashes and was taken to hospital.

Johns was arrested at the scene.
