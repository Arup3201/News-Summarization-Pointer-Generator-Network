Google has revealed an ambitious project to develop a pill that would test for cancer and other illnesses.

It would contain microscopic particles - nanoparticles - which can travel through the bloodstream and search for early signs of disease.

The tech giant hopes the system will one day allow cancer, heart disease and other diseases to be diagnosed and treated far earlier than they are today.

Google has revealed an ambitious project to develop a pill that would test for cancer and other illnesses. It says that nanoparticles could be combined with a wearable sensor to 'sniff' out and attach themselves to diseased cells - which could then be monitored using a handheld sensor

Nanoparticles could be ingested in a pill to enter the bloodstream.

They would be designed to bind to a particular type of cell – like a cancer tumor cell. This would be done by 'painting' them with a substance that could interact with the surface of cells.

They'd then travel together as a unit through the bloodstream.

The core of the nanoparticles would be magnetic, so a wearable device that creates a magnetic field could draw the particles – with their target cells in tow – toward it, where they could be detected and counted. 

Experts at Google are studying various non-invasive techniques, like light and radio waves, for detecting and counting the particles.

The technology is being developed at Google's X Lab, where work is also underway on smart contact lenses to monitor diabetes and special cutlery to eliminate the tremors of patients.  

'Much of the improvement in cancer survival rates over the last 30 years is due to earlier detection, like skin cancer screening and Pap smears,' Google said.

'Yet for many serious diseases, there still aren't good enough diagnostics to help doctors catch them in their earliest stages, when they're most treatable. 

'Pancreatic cancer is famously elusive, with only three per cent of cases found in the first, most curable stage. And some lung cancer tumours are so aggressive that they even kill people who go for annual CT screening, growing deadly in less than 12 months.'

Google's engineers hope to harness the chemical signals given off by cells as they become diseased. 

'We wondered: could continuous measurement of subtle changes in the chemistry of the blood be a way to detect a disease very early, when it's most treatable?'

The idea is that a patient would swallow a pill containing the microscopic particles, which travel through their bloodstream, searching for malignant cells. 

The particles would then report their findings to a sensor device that is worn on the body.

Google said the microscopic particles could be magnetised and coated with antibodies that bind with specific proteins or cells associated with various diseases. 

A wearable sensor would track the particles' magnetic fields.

Google said: 'Although we're still in the early stages of scientific exploration, we can imagine many different applications of this technology. 

'Maybe there could be a test for the enzymes given off by arterial plaques that are about to rupture and cause a heart attack or stroke. 

A Google smart contact lens that can monitor the glucose levels in the eye is being developed in a partnership with Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis. It  works using tiny sensors and microchips fitted into contact lenses that can then measure and read the amount of glucose in tears, before sending the information to a mobile device so diabetics can manage their condition.

'Perhaps someone could develop a diagnostic for post-surgery or post-chemo cancer patients – that's a lot of anxious people right there.

Google said it has already started work on the project, and plans to license the technology to medical firms to develop the finished tests.

The project was inspired by a Google engineer.

Two years ago, Google software engineer Tom Stanis was hit by a car while riding his bicycle. 

'He has no memory of the accident, but he'll never forget this: in the hospital emergency room, a doctor told him that his medical scans, intended to check for internal bleeding, had revealed a tumor in his kidney,' the firm said. 

Renal cancer typically has few if any symptoms until it's too late. 

Thanks to this unlikely early diagnosis, Tom had surgery to remove the tumor and is now cancer free. 

He's now a member of the Google X Life Sciences team and inspired them to pursue this project.

'We've run many promising experiments around four core components of a nanodiagnostics platform – designing nanoparticles, binding them to target cells, detecting them with a non-invasive device, and counting them.

'It could take years to reveal the potential of this technology – nature is a formidable foe – but we hope it's less than a decade, given what's at stake.'
