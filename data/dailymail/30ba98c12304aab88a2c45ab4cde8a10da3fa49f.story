A bus driver is being hailed as a hero after he prevented a suicidal woman from jumping off a bridge, it emerged today.

Buffalo bus driver Darnell Barton, 37, had just picked up 20 
high school students on the afternoon of Friday October 18 and was driving over a bridge when he spotted a woman
 standing along the railing on an overpass, leaning over the traffic 
below.

'It didn't seem real because what was going on around, traffic and pedestrians were going by as normal', he said.

Hero: Buffalo bus driver Darnell Barton had just picked up 20 high school students on the afternoon of Friday October 18 and was driving over a bridge when he spotted the woman

Strange: Darnell is driving along when he spots the young woman on the other side of the guard rail

Concerned: Barton, known as 'Big Country' stopped in the middle of the bridge, opened his door and yelled out, 'Ma'am are you okay?'

So Barton stopped in the middle of the bridge, opened his door and yelled out, 'Ma'am are you okay?' When she didn't respond, he got out and approached the young women, who was unresponsive, and put one arm around her.

He told WIVB4: 'She was distraught, she was distant,
 she was really disconnected.

'I grabbed her arm and put 
my arm around her and said "Do you want to come on this side of the 
guardrail?", and that was actually the first time she spoke to me she 
said yes.'

After lifting the woman, who is said to be in her twenties, over the rail, the pair sat on the ground talking until a corrections officer and another woman who said she was a counselor approached and took over.

'It was meant to be,' Barton said. 'I was supposed to be there for her at that moment and I was. I wanted to convey that whatever it was, I'm going to help you through and it's not as serious as jumping onto the 198.

'I feel like I did what I was supposed to do at the time,' Barton said. 'I'm a football guy so when you sit the bench and the coach calls your number, you gotta go in there make a play, do what the play calls for, and I think that's what I did.'

His co-workers call him 'Big Country', a big man with a big heart. When he returned to the bus to finish his route, his passengers gave him a round of applause.
