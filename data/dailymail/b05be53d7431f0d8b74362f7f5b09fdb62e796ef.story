Forecasters are today predicting a warm bank holiday weekend - despite large parts of northern England being covered in a blanket of snow overnight.

Britons would have been forgiven for thinking the worst of the weather was over after enjoying the warmest spell of the year earlier this month. However, as these pictures show, the freezing conditions have made an unwelcome return.

Around 2cm of snow fell today in Teesdale, County Durham, and across the northern Pennines.

The unseasonal chill is in stark 
contrast to a year ago to the day when glorious sunshine saw hundreds 
take to beaches and the countryside to bask in hot sunny weather.

However, it is not all bad news after 
forecasters today predicted that Britain can expect temperatures to 
reach 19C over the bank holiday weekend. 

Paul Mott, a senior forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said:

'The weather is going to be warming up a little bit, although the weekend is not going to be a scorcher.'

He said tomorrow could be quite 
chilly in England and Wales with temperatures probably only reaching 13C, although Scotland could see 16C.

Saturday
 is expected to be a mostly dry day in England and Wales, with 
temperatures as high as 17C  while the thermometer could touch 19C
 in southern England on Sunday.

Bank
 Holiday Monday could be chillier in the west, though, with rain 
sweeping in. But southern England could see temperatures of 17C.

Mr
 Mott said: 'Looking ahead to half-term next week, temperatures are 
likely to be near or slightly below normal and there could be some heavy
 showers.'

Britons were left battled by the odd weather conditions  today - clinging on to brollies one minute, and donning hats and sunglasses the next.

Across the country, confusion reigned as the heavens opened, the wind buffeted - and then the blazing sun came out.

And then it all happened again - four seasons in one day.

In south-west London this morning, 
hail the size of ball-bearings bounced down for 10 minutes before giving
 way to unbroken sunshine, which was later followed by thunder and rain 
showers over the capital.

The unpredictable conditions are set 
to continue tomorrow, forecasters said, before a change of fortune for 
the Bank Holiday Weekend when the sunshine will be more reliable and 
lasting.

Blizzards swept across the Cairngorm 
mountains in Scotland  - forcing road closures and sending temperatures 
plunging below zero.

The Met Office said the region was hit by winds of 75mph and temperatures as low as -17 with the wind chill.

Holidaymakers Tony and Sheila Farmer,
 both 65, who are touring the area from Kent, found the A939 blocked at 
Corgarff, Aberdeenshire.

Mr Farmer said: 'We weren't really expecting to see this weather.

'It's probably about two degrees at 
the moment, there's at least a few inches of snow up here and there's a 
really biting cold wind.

'We were just driving up to Inverness and we came across this road but it was closed.'

The Facebook page of the Aviemore-based Cairngorm Reindeer Herd reported snow four inches deep in their car park.

A total of 66 sets of roadworks are due 
to be completed in England ahead of the bank holiday, while a further 37
 works will be suspended over the holiday period.

The AA said as many as 17 million cars could be on the roads over the weekend.

It said the busiest times would be tomorrow evening and Saturday with people possibly making up for not getting away at Easter.

Some
 roadworks on motorways and major A-roads have been lifted for the 
holiday period but works remain on some busy roads, including the M25 
and the M4.

On the 
railways, there will be engineering work on some routes, including the 
West Coast main line, and major development work beginning at London 
Bridge station.

British Airways will be carrying more
 than 463,000 customers over the bank holiday weekend, with 128,000

Top short-haul destinations include Nice, Barcelona, Malaga, Rome, Edinburgh and Paris.

Over
 the bank holiday, platforms 8-16 at London Bridge station, which are 
used by the Southern train company, will be closed to prepare the area 
for work on platforms 14-16.

Between
 Saturday and Monday, no Southern services will call at London Bridge 
and some will be diverted to Victoria station in London.

From
 Tuesday until next spring, platforms 14, 15 and 16 will remain closed 
while they are redeveloped and platform 13 will be narrowed.

Rail
 routes on which there will be engineering work over the weekend include
 St Pancras in London and Luton; London and Rugby; Preston and 
Lancaster; and all routes through Wolverhampton.

Information
 company Trafficmaster said routes on the roads which are likely to be 
particularly busy included the M3 in Hampshire, the M4 heading west, the
 M6 around Blackpool, sections of the M25 and the A82 towards the 
Scottish Highlands.

Lowcostholidays.com said top searches for late getaways on its site were Majorca, the Portuguese Algarve, Malta, Dubai and Barcelona.

Holiday lettings agency HolidayCottages.co.uk said the hot weather during the early-May bank holiday weekend had prompted a bookings boom.

Meanwhile, research from M&S Bank
 showed that the average cost of an overseas holiday for a family of 
four this half-term had risen by 4.05%, or Â£128, since this time last 
year, largely due to increasing local costs and less-favourable exchange
 rates.

Foreign exchange 
company Travelex said UK holidaymakers heading for Europe would find 
themselves 5% worse off than 12 months ago, receiving 29 fewer euros for
 every Â£500 exchanged.

Those
 travelling to the United States would discover that the pound had 
weakened 7 per cent against the dollar since the beginning of this year.

Mark
 Tanzer, chief executive of travel organisation Abta, said 'Thousands of
 families will be heading off this Friday for an early summer break.

'Families are flying to Spain, in 
particular the Balearic and Canary islands, and those heading to Turkey 
are in for a scorcher, with temperatures set to hit 40C (104F) next 
week. North Africa is also popular at this time of year, offering 
guaranteed warmth and sunshine.'

The Association of Train Operating Companies (Atoc) anticipated about 6.5 million rail journeys will be made over the bank holiday weekend.

An Atoc spokesman said: 'The vast majority of people travelling by train this bank holiday will be unaffected by improvement work.'

Channel Tunnel high-speed train company Eurostar said it expected to handle more than 120,000 passengers over the weekend - 10 per cent more than over the Diamond Jubilee bank holiday period last year which was the first weekend in June.

Tomorrow will be Eurostar's busiest day of the holiday period.

Bosses at Gatwick said more than 790,000 passengers would be passing through the West Sussex airport between bank holiday Monday and Sunday June 2.
