The 'legacy' painting by famed artist Eric Ravilious had been picked up at a house probate sale by the elderly collector, who thought it was just a print.

She hung the work, featuring bathing machines on a beach, on the wall of her bungalow home in Oxfordshire until her sudden death earlier this year.

Her husband gathered it up along with a mass of other prints which were then viewed and valued by art expert Sarah Lewis at JS Auctions of Banbury, Oxon.

She almost immediately realised it was an original work by Ravilious, who painted 'Bathing Machines, Aldeburgh' in 1938.

Eric Ravilious' 'Bathing Machines, Aldeburgh' sold for a record-breaking £312,700 at auction after a widower took what he thought was a print to be valued

The watercolour was one of a series of three he produced on a visit of the Suffolk seaside town for an exhibition held a year later.

It was bought at the exhibition by a collector whose family owned it for the next 74 years until it appeared in the probate sale last year, when it was snapped up the wife of the vendor.

Upon hearing of the discovery, Ann Ullmann, the daughter Ravilious, dashed to the auction rooms to view her father's painting for the first time. She described it as 'an absolute corker'.

Art experts immediately realised the piece was an original work by Ravilious, who painted 'Bathing Machines, Aldeburgh' in 1938, and the masterpiece was quickly snapped up by a London-based art dealer (file pictures)

The widower said he was 'blown away' by the final hammer price of £265,000 for the painting, before fees were added (file pictures)

The vendor, who is aged in his 70s, was astonished when told it was to be given a pre-sale estimate of £40,000 to £60,000 and was 'blown away and speechless' by the final hammer price of £265,000.

With all the fees added on the overall price paid for the 16ins by 20ins work was £312,700. It was bought by a London-based buyer.

The sum is a record for a work by Ravilious.

Joe Smith, of JS Auctions, said: 'The vendor's wife bought it at the end of last year from a deceased estate and hung it on her wall.

'She assumed it to be a print and paid very, very little for it, under £100.

'As soon as our valuer saw it she said it was the real deal. The paint was still visible under a glass and the original gallery label from 1939 was still on the back.

'The vendor was astonished how much it might be worth. I spoke to him after the sale and he couldn't say very much, I think he was blown away by it.

'It's a bit like a lottery win. He isn't a big, flash person and I would think he will share the money among his family. It is a nice legacy of his wife's passion of art.'

Eric Ravilious served as a war artist until his death in 1942, in this piece, Night Operations, he depicts coastal defences of Eastbourne

Eric Ravilious, from Acton, west London, was a respected artist who had the ability to capture light like no other painter.

Eric William Ravilious (22 July 1903- 2 September 1942) was an British watercolour painter, designer, book illustrator and wood engraver.

His early work depicts the  countryside and urban London scenes.

He is renowned for capturing a sense of 'Englishness' that existed between the wars.

He also designed a number of popular pieces for Wedgwood between 1936 and 1940 including a Coronation mug for Edward VIII which was adapted for that of George V.

He later became an official war artist in World War II and received a commission as a Captain in the Royal Marines.

He was killed in 1942, aged 39, while accompanying a Royal Air Force rescue mission off Iceland that failed to return to its base.

He studied in Florence and taught at the Royal College of Art and painted ceramic designs for Wedgewood.

He went on to create watercolour paintings of English landscapes but was not prolific which is why his work achieves high prices now. 

Ravilious became a war artist in World War Two but tragically died in August 1942 aged 39 when his Lockhead Hudson aircraft disappeared off the coast of Iceland.

He left a wife, Tirzah Garwood, an artist, and three children, John, James and Anne.

Blue plaques appear on the front of two properties the couple lived in in Hammersmith, west London, and later Castle Hedingham in Essex.

Mr Smith said: 'He was a highly respected artist who was very much ahead of his time. He managed to capture shades and sunlight so well. He wasn't prolific, hence the high prices.

'His daughter, Anne, caught a train up here because she wanted to see the painting. She said it was an 'absolute corker'.'
