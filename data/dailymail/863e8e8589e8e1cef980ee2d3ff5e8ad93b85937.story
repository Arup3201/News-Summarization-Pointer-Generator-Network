With her long golden hair, schoolgirl Katy White could be Wales' answer to fairytale heroine Rapunzel. 

Katy, a pupil at Amman Valley Comprehensive, isn't short of admirers, who stop her to marvel at the length of her hair - which is almost the same height as her. 

Katy, of Bishop Road, Ammanford, is 4ft 11in and her hair, which flows to the back of her knees, measures  3ft 4in.

Realife life Rapunzel: Katy White, aged 12, is 4ft 11in and her hair, which flows to the back of her knees, measures 3ft 4in

In her 12 year life she has only had her hair cut three times (apart from the time she cut her own fringe). 

'There was a time, when Katy was about six, when she decided to cut two big chunks out of the front of her hair,' said mother Barbara. 

Great lengths: In her 12 year life, Katy, who wears her hair in a plait mostly, has only had her hair cut three times (apart from the time she cut her own fringe)

Lengthy process: On average, Katy's hair takes an hour to wash and just as long to dry but a local hairdresser, who measured it, said it's in great condition

Loves her locks: Despite having trouble with it when she practices sports, Katy says she can't imagine ever cutting her hair

'I saw the hair in the bin and assumed Katy had thrown a doll away. When I pulled the hair out I turned around and saw that Katy had two huge steps in the front of her hair. Apart from that she's only ever had it trimmed at the hairdressers, and only three times.'

But as well as attracting admirers, Katy's hair also creates it own problems. 

'It may be beautiful but it can also be pretty deadly,' laughed Barbara. 'She practices the martial art Choi Kwang Do, and to do that we have to put her hair in a plait. 

'The only problem is that when she spins, her hair whips round, and people have to move out of the way. It's like a secret weapon.'

Not quite long enough: Despite its head-turning capabilities, a spokesperson from the Guinness World Record said Katy's hair is not yet record-breaking

Showstopping: Lots of people apparently stop her to marvel at the length of her hair, which is almost the same height as her

On average, Katy's hair takes an hour to wash and just as long to dry. 'People stop me to ask about my hair all the time, I'm used to it now,' said Katy. 

'I can't imagine having it cut, although I do have it tied back most of the time, especially when I'm in school.' 

Having never officially had her hair measured, hairdresser Lisa Bryan from Bedazzled, in Ammanford, stepped forward to measure Katy's mane.

'I haven't ever seen hair this long before,' said Lisa. 'It clearly is well looked after.'

Despite its head-turning capabilities, a spokesperson from the Guinness World Record said Katy's hair is not yet record-breaking but added: 'That is some long hair for a girl of her age.'

Asha Mandela and her 55ft long dreadlocks currently hold the world title.
