The young red fox had got itself in a bit of a jam. There was only one thing for it - the notoriously shy creature was going to have to ask humans for help.

It clearly couldn't resist having a look at a discarded glass jar and ended up with its head stuck inside.

In this short but sweet footage, the fox is spotted by two men on a Russian dirt road.

As two men walked along a Russian dirt road, they noticed a fox with its head trapped in a jar ahead

Instead of running away from humans, the wild fox ran towards the men, knowing they might be able to help

Instead of running away, like a wild fox normally would, the trapped fox scurried up to the men.

One of the men reached down to grab the jar, which made the creature wriggle to try to escape.

But the fox quickly realised that tactic wouldn't work and stood still for its rescuer.

The man, who appeared to be wearing camouflage army gear, grabbed the fox by the scruff of its neck and pulled the jar away with his other hand.

The fox quickly realised it needed to stand still while the man took it by the scruff of its neck and gently tugged the jar away

In a flash, the fox made the most of its freedom and ran away.

The man joked in Russian: 'Where is the thank you?' according to 9 MSN.

He then said: 'Thank you' in a higher-pitched voice, pretending to be their bushy-tailed friend.

The other man pointed out: 'He would have died that way.'

The fox made a quick dash to freedom while one of the men joked in Russian: 'Where's the thank you?'
