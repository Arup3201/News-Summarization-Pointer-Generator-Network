With its own 40ft ballroom, this six-bedroom apartment is perfect for hosting a party - but it will set you back £35.5million. 

The luxurious property, 12 Queen Anne's Gate in central London, is one of the most expensive for sale on the open market and has been described by the estate agent as being of 'ambassadorial proportions'.  

It has stunning views over Horse Guards Parade, while Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament are within walking distance.

Vast: The 60ft family room in the basement has doors opening out to the surrounding gardens which are close to Buckingham Palace

The 11,000 sq/ft home was built in 1820 and was originally intended for residential use. It was then converted into offices in the 1960s and used by the Home Office and Crown Prosecution Service, but it has since been turned back into a residence. 

Alongside the six double bedrooms, it has four bathrooms, two shower rooms, a cloakroom, five reception rooms and a steam kitchen.

The property has been put up for sale with estate agency Russell Simpson with an asking price of £35.5 million - and whoever buys it having to fork out £2.5 million in stamp duty alone.

Alan Russell, founder of Russell Simpson, said: '12 Queen Anne's Gate is a wonderful period property, offering spectacular views of St. James's Park and is moments away from Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament.

'Spanning over 11,000 sq/ft, this two floored apartment in the centre of London provides four bedrooms, a 60ft family room, as well as a grand 40ft ballroom, that would have hosted a number of glamorous parties throughout its history.'

Expansive: The large rooms are surrounded by wooden panelling and have been described as having 'ambassadorial proportions' 

Picturesque: The luxury apartment has views over St James's Park and is a short walk from the Houses of Parliament and Whitehall

Washing: The enormous bathroom comes with a multiple-headed shower and a spacious bathtub

Elaborate greeting: The double-door entrance leads into a corridor lined by stone pillars. Inside is an upward-spiralling staircase 

Interior: The floor of  the 200-year-old property, which was once used by the Home Office,  has been designed using mosaics and sits below gold-topped pillars
