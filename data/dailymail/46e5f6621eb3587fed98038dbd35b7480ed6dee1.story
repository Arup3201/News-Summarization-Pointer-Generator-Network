'I don't particularly like coming second to Lewis,' said Nico Rosberg after seeing his team-mate, and only rival for this year's Formula One title, seal pole position for Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix.

It was the second such statement from Rosberg this season; the first coming after he lost his epic duel with Hamilton in Bahrain. Indeed, Hamilton replied: 'We already know,' before the Mercedes duo shared a rather uncomfortable laugh.

For Rosberg however, and while he might not like being second-best to his team-mate (who does?) it's become a rather consistent feature of the 2014 season.

Hamilton now boasts a 4-1 record over Rosberg in qualifying this season, while in the races themselves – discounting Australia, where Hamilton retired through a technical fault – the Briton leads 3-0. I make that 7-1. Ominous stuff.

Rosberg has spoken at length at the importance of halting Hamilton's momentum this weekend.

\But a fourth victory in as many races for the British driver tomorrow would see him take charge of the championship for the first time this season.

You get the feeling that Rosberg can't let that happen if he stands any chance of winning the title. But with Hamilton in this form – he even described his Mercedes as a 'nightmare' to drive on Saturday – it could be argued that you wouldn't give the German much hope.

Down in the dumps: Sebastian Vettel

It perhaps shows how far Sebastian Vettel has fallen that he was given a standing ovation on his way back to the paddock after breaking down yet again on Saturday.

It wasn't all that long ago that the four-time world champion was a target of the boo-brigade; fans seemingly unhappy with his treatment of Mark Webber in Malaysia and then his subsequent dominance. We almost forget that he won the final nine races of last season.

But as he hopped on to the back of a scooter before returning to the Red Bull garage, the partisan Spanish crowd were on their feet.

While Vettel has taken the bold step of changing his chassis for this weekend's race, his team-mate Daniel Ricciardo goes from strength-to-strength.

Not only was he best of the rest, albeit a second down on the Mercedes pair, he was over four tenths quicker than Vettel in Q2 before the German's car packed up.

Is he out-performing the car? Perhaps. He is certainly out-performing Vettel. It makes you wonder how closely he would have run the German over the past four years?

Pastor Maldonado was back in the wars on Saturday after embarrassingly binning his Lotus on his very first lap.

Maldonado's latest faux pas comes after he spun while taking his eyes off the road making his adjustments to his steering wheel before crashing on his entrance to the pits last time out in China.

It's difficult to know who to feel more sorry for? Maldonado for becoming something of a derisory figure amongst the paddock and the sport's fans. The cash-strapped Lotus team for footing the repair bill. Or his mechanics for having to put his car back together, again.

Either way, it's stunning to think the Venezuelan actually won this race for Williams two years ago.  I think it's fair to say that, bar a minor miracle, it's unlikely he'll be presented in the winners' circle ever again.

Max Chilton may have been quickest in the Marussia vs Caterham battle – the Briton qualifying a rather credible 18th – his time would only have been good enough for fourth on the GP2 grid.

Indeed Marcus Ericsson's lap-time in FP2 would have seen him qualify plum last in Formula One's feeder series.

Hamilton's pole time was almost five seconds slower than Rosberg's pole position of one year ago. All in all, hardly a glowing advertisement for motor racing's wealthiest series.

Hamilton's pole was the 35th of his career, and first at the Spanish Grand Prix.

Aside from Brazil, it remains the only venue where he hasn't tasted victory in his eight-year career. But the odds favour him to break his duck tomorrow.

Eleven of the last 13 pole sitters have gone on to win, while Fernando Alonso was the first driver to qualify outside the top three and win the race when he was victorious in last year's grand prix.
