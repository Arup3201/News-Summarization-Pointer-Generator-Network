Bring him back: Parents are demanding headteacher James Gallogly stays at the school

A dedicated head accused of manhandling a disruptive pupil has been forced to resign, despite a parents’ protest and the staunch support of the mother and father of the ‘victim’.

James Gallogly, 45, was suspended from his £60,000 post at a primary school after it was alleged he pinned the autistic boy against a wall.

However, the parents of Ryan Johns have given Mr Gallogly their full support and admitted their eight-year-old son is difficult to control.

Mr Gallogly was accused by a fellow teacher of using unnecessary force to control the pupil.

But he was backed with a petition signed by 100 parents, who pleaded with governors to reinstate him for the good of the school and pupils.

When the governors refused, around 20 children were removed from the 160-pupil school by their angry parents.

Now, after a seven-month investigation into Mr Gallogly’s ‘discipline methods’, he has resigned.

Last night Ryan’s parents, Adele Johns and David Deakin, condemned education chiefs for carrying out a ‘vindictive’ witch-hunt against a well-respected head.

‘This situation is a disgrace and the treatment of Mr Gallogly is appalling,’ said Miss Johns, 28.

Mr
 Deakin, 45, a carer, said: ‘We know Ryan is difficult. We were called 
in to school to be told Ryan was involved in the allegations against Mr 
Gallogly, but the communication we’ve had since has been terrible.

‘We don’t even know when this alleged incident is supposed to have taken place.’

Since
 Mr Gallogly’s suspension last December, five acting head teachers have 
been put in charge of the school at different times.

Support: Autistic Ryan, with his mother Adele, refused to make a complaint and with his family have called for the popular teacher to be given his job back

Miss
 Johns said her son’s education had suffered and his behaviour had 
deteriorated. Since the incident, he has been excluded for spitting and 
biting a teacher and throwing a chair at a member of staff.

The
 couple wrote a letter in support of Mr Gallogly and demanded his 
reinstatement at St Benedict’s Catholic Primary School in Wilmslow, 
Cheshire. They helped organise the petition and have withdrawn their 
other children, Emily, ten, and Afton, seven, from the school in 
protest.

‘The treatment of 
Mr Gallogly has been diabolical,’ said Cath Massey, another parent. ‘The
 governors of St Benedict’s need to be brought to task over this sorry 
episode.’

Parent Jack 
Fletcher added: ‘Mr Gallogly is a well-respected head teacher who has 
worked hard to bring the school up to the standard it is today. He spent
 numerous extra hours looking after the poorer and socially deprived 
children and always had time to speak to parents.’

After
 12 years at the school, Mr Gallogly will officially finish at the end 
of August. Three other teachers are also set to leave the school.

Mr
 Gallogly, who serves on the  finance board of the Diocese of 
Shrewsbury, declined to comment at his home in Hazel Grove, Stockport.

But Cheshire East Council said he had been suspended after ‘other issues around his discipline methods’ came to light.

A
 spokesman said: ‘Issues have been raised and they have been 
investigated properly, according to agreed procedures, with the full 
involvement of the school governors, who are the head teacher’s 
employers, and the Diocese of Shrewsbury.

‘Pupil
 turnover is slightly higher than normal, but it cannot be assumed that 
children leaving is as a result of the head teacher.’
