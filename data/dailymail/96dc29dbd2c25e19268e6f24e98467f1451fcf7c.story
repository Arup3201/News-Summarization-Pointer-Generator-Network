More than £160,000 of taxpayers' money has been spent buying new televisions for the House Of Commons, it has emerged.

According to official figures, more than 1,500 new televisions were purchased during the last financial year, an expense campaigners have slammed as a 'bad deal' for taxpayers.

The Commons said the televisions were needed because of the digital switchover and will actually lead to savings.

More than £160,000 has been spent buying 1,500 new televisions in the Houses of Parliament

The House of Commons said the televisions were needed so MPs and visitors could see what was happening in each of the Chambers

The details emerged following a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mirror.

A Commons spokesperson today said: 'Ensuring that workers and visitors on the Parliamentary Estate are aware of what is happening in each of the Chambers is essential to Parliamentary business.

'Parliament’s Annunciators use television screens to display this information live.'

The spokesperson said because of the national digital switchover in 2012, and due to the age of the existing analogue screens, 'compatible digital screens' had been installed.

The new televisions are expected to be cheaper to run, the spokesperson said: 'These screens are more energy efficient than the previous analogue models, and it is estimated that the switch will result in a reduction in maintenance costs of around £22,000 across the lifetime of the sets and £15,000 reduction in energy cost per annum.'

Taxpayers' Alliance campaign manager Andy Silvester said: 'Hard-pressed taxpayers up and down the country will wonder why they're not being handed free TVs too.

Around £36,000 had been spent replacing two panes of glass in the atrium at the £235million Portcullis House where fig trees have also been rented and maintained at a cost of more than £30,000 a year

'This is a bad deal for taxpayers. There are plenty of ways for MPs to check what's going on in the Chamber for free, and this huge bill won't sit well with the public. The easiest and cheapest way would be for them to spend more time in the actual Chamber themselves.'

The TV purchases follows revelations earlier this month that £36,000 had been spent replacing two panes of glass at the £235million Portcullis House.

The money was used to repair the roof of the atrium in the building which is opposite the Houses of Parliament.

And it comes as alcohol prices in the Commons have been frozen again - even though MPs' food and drink is already subsidised by millions of pounds a year.

Taxpayers stump up £7million a year to keep restaurant and bar bills down in Parliament.

In 2012 official figures showed that £32,500 a year was being spent on renting and maintaining evergreeen trees at Portcullis House.

Since the exotic weeping fig trees were imported from Florida and planted in 2001, more than £400,000 has been spent on them.
