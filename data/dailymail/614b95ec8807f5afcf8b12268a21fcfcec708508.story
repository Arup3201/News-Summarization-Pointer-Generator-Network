A privileged student caught with 26.7 grammes of cocaine - the equivalent of 260 lines - in his university dorm, has been jailed.

Affluent businessman’s son Zachery Ahmimed, 22, stashed the drugs in his room in the University of Kent’s oldest college, Eliot.

Canterbury Crown Court heard college staff raided Ahmimed’s room after students complained about the smell of cannabis.

Judge Simon James, sentencing Ahmimed to
16 months in jail, said it was ‘very sad for all concerned’ that 
someone ‘intelligent, from a supportive and caring family and looking 
forward to a bright future’ should become involved in drugs.

He said: ‘Whatever you or anybody else might think about cocaine that it is cool, it isn’t and it has the capacity to ruin people’s lives.

‘Day in and day out these courts have to deal with the human misery caused by Class A drugs.

‘The fact that prior to this you had only used cannabis is a graphic illustration of how that can, and often does, lead to involvement in far more addictive drugs.’

Judge James added that the parents of students and other young people who come to Canterbury to better their education ‘have a right to look to the court for help in protecting the young from the pitfalls of drugs’.

Ahmimed, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, was found with 26.7 grams of cocaine and a ‘large wad of cash’.

The accounting and finance student admitted possessing cocaine with intent to supply to his student peers.

Denzil Pugh, prosecutor, said Ahmimed, whose father was in court to hear the sentence, claimed to have got the drugs near his family’s home town of Rotherham.

The court heard Ahmimed had been ‘in the grip of an addiction to cannabis’, but had worked to tackle his drugs problem.
