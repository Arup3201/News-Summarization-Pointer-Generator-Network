Brought up by a man she thought was her father until the age of eight and with one failed marriage already behind her, it's perhaps no surprise that actress Liv Tyler has a more wary approach to relationships than most.

Now the star, 36, has revealed that despite a stellar career and stunning looks, her longest and healthiest relationship with a male to date has been with her son Milo, nine.

'To have a son was huge for me, because 
it’s been the most solid, healthy, consistent relationship I’ve ever had
with a male in my whole life,' she said.

Healthy: According to Liv Tyler, her most consistent relationship with a male has been with her son Milo, 9

Mystified: Liv had an unconventional upbringing which she admits has left her slightly baffled by men

'[Milo] just wants me to make him 
breakfast and walk him to school and read to him at night and help him 
with his homework – all the basic things that any child would want.'

She continued: 'He 
couldn’t give a rat’s ass about me being famous or a movie star or 
anything. I learn so much from him.'

Milo, who was born in 2004, is the son of Tyler's former husband, diminutive British musician, Royston Langdon.

She and Langdon, the lead singer of indie band Spacehog, vowed to remain friends in the wake of their 2008 divorce on their son's behalf.

It's a situation that Tyler is familiar with as she is herself the product of divorced parents who remained friends for their daughter's sake - with one major difference.

Liv's model mother Bebe Buell kept the identity of her daughter's real father secret - and the young Liv believed rock star Todd Rundgren was her father until the age of eight.

Stylish: The actress also revealed that her elegant mother and grandmother influenced her personal style

Daddy dearest: Liv now enjoys a good relationship with her father, Aerosmith frontman Steve Tyler

It was then that she noticed a similarity between herself and 'Uncle' Steve Tyler's daughter Mia and it dawned on her that Buell might not have been telling the truth about her paternity.

The result was a unique upbringing, which Tyler says has left her mystified by men. 'I
was raised by the women in my life,' she revealed in an interview with Net-a-Porter's digital fashion magazine, The Edit.

'That’s made me incredibly strong 
and resilient. I’ve always been able to support myself 
and my family on my own.

'Men are a bit of a mystery to me in a way. They
are visitors. They visit my life. I am always surprised when there is 
one around.'

But mystery males weren't the only legacy of her mother and grandmother left for her - their love of fashion and their elegant approach to dressing also left their mark.

Old-fashioned: According to Liz, she has an antediluvian body shape and suits retro corseted styles as a result

'I find myself inspired all the time by 
my mother and my grandmother and their innate natural elegance, much 
more than fashion or trends that are hot right now,' she explained.

That she attributes in part to having an 'old-fashioned' body shape. 'I have quite an old-fashioned body, the
shape of it,' she says.

'Corseted, pulled in, little waist, pointy 
boobs – that look actually really suits me, because there’s some 
construction to it.

'I always go back to the classic images; I can’t help
but be influenced by Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn, Paul Newman and 
Steven McQueen, and the Kennedys.

'It’s strange: I’m 
very independent and quite modern as a woman in many ways, but I’m also 
quite old-fashioned.'
