Next time you arrive at the airport, the person checking you in may know your name, destination and even your dietary requirements before you even open your mouth.

Virgin Atlantic’s concierge staff in the Upper Class lounge at London Heathrow have begun trialling a scheme in which hostesses recognise passengers using Google Glass.

The technology will be able to identify a customer, see their flight details and preferences, before showing the hostess their flight information, and more.

The Google Glass trial is designed to create a more personalised service on Virgin flights, yet Virgin Atlantic also asked 10,000 passengers what they wanted most from the airline.

More space and bigger windows was the most popular demand, with 60 per cent of people claiming this would improve their flight experience. 

On-board Wi-Fi came second with 55 per cent, while a third would prefer personalised menus ordered in advance. 

In the UK, 41 per cent of passengers said their favourite thing about flying is the in-flight entertainment system.

Worldwide, only Japanese passengers said that they prefer the free drinks (47 per cent) over in-flight entertainment (39 per cent).

The technology then immediately begins checking that passenger in, and can update the hostess on travel information, weather and events at the customer's destination.

This personalised service can also store preferences for future trips.

Virgin Atlantic is trialling the scheme for the next six weeks at Heathrow's Terminal Three, and if successful, the initiative may be rolled to other lounges and airports.

Google Glass has already proved useful in other industries, including interior design and medicine. 

At the end of last year, a surgeon at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Centre spent almost four months using Google Glass during operations.

Dr Pierre Theodore used the display on the wearable technology to see X-ray scans without having to leave the room, or consult a separate chart.

He was also able to control the device using voice commands.

Elsewhere, Dr Christopher Kaeding performed knee-ligament surgery while wearing Google Glass in Ohio last September, and broadcast the operation to students at Ohio State University.

Architects and interior designers have also been developing ways of using the technology to help plan and virtually decorate houses.

ColorSnap Glass, for example, is a free app that uses the device’s built-in camera with Ohio-based paint group Sherwin Williams' colour recognition technology.

In 2007, BMW developed its own smartglasses that help mechanics fix cars using augmented reality. When a mechanic looks at the engine of a BMW, while wearing the glasses, a 3D colourful display is laid over the top of the original engine view, pictured

In 2007, BMW developed its own brand of smartglasses that can help mechanics fix cars using augmented reality.

The glasses are part of BMW’s wider Augmented Reality: The Extension of Reality project and the software includes various makes and models of BMW cars.

Google Glass, pictured, has a built-in camera that displays web pages and other files on a built-in screen. It is controlled by touch, or by voice, making it perfect for hands-free tasks
