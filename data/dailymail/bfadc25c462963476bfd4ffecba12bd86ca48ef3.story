Just a month after she filed for divorce from actor Josh Lucas, Jessica Henriquez has opened up about another tragic loss; half of her hearing.

Ms Ciencin Henriquez, a 28-year-old writer and mother-of-one based in New York, was working as an office assistant four years ago, when out of nowhere, an agonizing piercing sound struck her ears; forcing her straight to the ER, where doctors diagnosed her with 'sudden hearing loss' in one ear.

'I can’t hear you. I can’t hear anything!' Ms Ciencin Heriquez writes for Salon, recalling her heartbreaking words to her doctor during the hospital hearing test. 'At 24, I had gone from a feisty, uninhibited, outspoken yogini to a statistic.'

In addition to losing her hearing in one ear, Ms Ciencin Henriquez struggled with accompanying nausea and vertigo, and it was months before she managed to regain her balance.

'New York City, the vibrant place I’d once fallen madly for, became a nightmare,' she writes. 'The streets were humming, whirring. Tractors moaned, ambulances screamed, the click of lighters and the hiss of brooms brushing cafe floors were torture.'

Only a year later, Ms Ciencin Henriquez would meet 42-year-old Sweet Home Alabama star Josh Lucas quite by chance at a New York dog park; marry him soon after and have their son Noah, now two.

But dating immediately after she lost her hearing was nothing short of 'bleak,' according to her account. 'Men would repeat their clever lines only once or twice before mumbling "never mind" and moving onto the next woman,' she writes. 'Deaf was not sexy, deaf was mortifying.'

For months, Ms Ciencin Henriquez refused to leave the house much and when she did, she was anxious and withdrawn. Because her condition was 'invisible' and she had retained hearing in one ear, she just about got away with hiding her disability - a term she admits she has only recently become comfortable using - from friends. But only for so long.

'Deaf was not sexy, deaf was mortifying'

Eventually, as the hearing in her other ear began to fade, she was forced to make her peace with it. And while she confesses she will always be known as 'someone’s half-deaf friend Jess', she says it no longer defines her.

Now she arrives to dinner parties early to nab a seat at the end of the table so as to expose her good hear to as many guests as possible, and has sourced special headphones which enable her to enjoy music properly.

Sadly, Ms Ciencin Henriquez has also had to accept the fact that her good ear will also eventually fail her.

'Because one ear is strained from doing the work of two, I will completely lose my ability to hear,' she writes. 'It will happen sooner rather than later and knowing that is terrifying.'

It's not the only brush she has had with ill health.

The year after Ms Ciencin Henriquez lost her hearing, and right before she met Mr Lucas, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. In an interview with The Huffington Post, she reveals that her then-new boyfriend, now ex-husband, was the first person she shared the news with.

'I will completely lose my ability to 
hear. It will happen sooner rather than later and knowing 
that is terrifying'

'I just blurted out. "I'm sick," and he was the first person I told. It was terrifying to say it out loud because it gave it power and made it real, and it meant that I had cancer,' she said.

Just six weeks into their relationship, and while Ms Ciencin Henriquez was undergoing grueling treatment, Mr Lucas proposed to her. They married in 2012.

Just as doctors informed her that she would likely have to undergo a hysterectomy, she discovered she was pregnant, and against the advice of 'every oncologist' she spoke to, Ms Ciencin Henriquez went ahead with the 'difficult but successful' pregnancy.

'When we were picking baby names, we specifically picked the name Noah, because it meant “calm and restful,”' she wrote. 'We were like, "Wow, that’s what we need.

'We need something in our life that’s just going to be so calm and peaceful because we haven’t had that since we’ve been together."'

In January of this year, the couple split and last month Ms Ciencin Henriquez filed for divorce. She has neglected to say why; but both parties insist that their parting was mutually amicable.

In a recent interview with People, Mr Lucas said: 'We have been through a divorce and divorce isn't something I would wish on my worst enemy.

'Even when in our case we have managed to do it not only amicably but as - hopefully in the end great friends - particularly because we have a young child that we both truly love.'
