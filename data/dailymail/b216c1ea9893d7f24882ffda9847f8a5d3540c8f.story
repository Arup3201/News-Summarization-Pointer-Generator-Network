A woman claiming to be Chad 'Ochocinco' Johnson's former mistress has revealed they had a four-month relationship earlier this year as his now-wife Evelyn Lozada planned their wedding.

Beverly Shiner, 30, told RadarOnline  she first contacted Johnson through Twitter and they went on have a passionate affair from January to May behind his fiancée's back.

The claim comes just days after Johnson was arrested for allegedly headbutting his wife of a month after she confronted him over a receipt for condoms she found in his car.

And, if these latest claims are to be believed, it seems Lozada, who married Johnson in July, was justified in fearing her husband was cheating on her.

'Mistress': Beverly Shiner, a 30-year-old mother of two from Boston, said she had a four-month affair with NFL player Chad Johnson while he was engaged to Evelyn Lozada, who he is accused of attacking

Shiner, a mother of two from Boston, said she enjoyed a four-month relationship with Johnson, who asked her out for dinner after she contacted him on Twitter.

'I Googled him before we met and saw he was engaged, but at the time there were reports that she had broken it off because she thought he was cheating, so I assumed they had split up,' she said.

Despite later discovering women's toiletries in the bathroom of his Foxborough, Massachusetts home and realising he was still engaged, Shiner said she still slept with him.

Johnson took little care to hide their affair, Shiner said. As he watched the Super Bowl with his wife and children, he was texting his mistress 'saying he was missing me', she claimed.

Not-so-happy couple: Shiner claims they were conducting the affair while Johnson was engaged. He married Evelyn Lozada on July 4 at Le Chateau des Palmiers on the island of St. Maarten

Shiner added that she too had little respect for Evelyn, who she followed on Twitter to find out when she was out of town. Once she overheard Johnson treating his wife-to-be dismally, she said.

'He called Evelyn and asked if she could order a pizza to be delivered for him, and even had her pay for it on her credit card,' she said. 'I thought it was odd and wondered if she was really his fiancee or just a secretary.'

But the affair ended in May after the couple spent a 'passionate night together', according to RadarOnline. As she went to visit him again at his home, he did not respond to her calls, she said.

She arrived at his house and could hear him inside, but he refused to let her in. When the spoke the next day, he wouldn't apologise and claimed he had been sleeping, she said.

'I got upset and told him, "You are not the guy I thought you were"', she said.

He responded: 'You’re overstepping your boundaries a little bit. I’m not your man, keep your comments to yourself,' she said.

Released: NFL star Chad Johnson bonded out of 
jail 16 hours after being arrested for allegedly headbutting his new 
wife Evelyn Lozada, right, outside their home in Davie, Florida on 
Saturday night

Despite this treatment, Shiner said Johnson truly cared for her and told her he wanted to move in with her and have children together. He said he did not care if his fiance found out about the affair.

'He said, "I’m not doing anything different than what every other man is doing,2 he thinks it is fine to cheat. I feel he was completely disrespectful and he led me on,' she said.

Johnson's lawyer did not respond to a request from MailOnline for a comment on the allegations.

They come as Lozada, who stars in Basketball Wives, spoke out for the first time since the alleged attack on Saturday night in Miami, Florida, and it was revealed she has filed for a divorce.

After Johnson allegedly headbutted 
Lozada, he has since been kicked out of the Miami Dolphins and VH1 dropped the 
couple's reality TV series, Ev and Ocho.

'I am deeply disappointed that Chad has failed to take responsibility for his actions and made false accusations against me,' Lozada said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight.

Charged: Johnson has been charged with battery 
and domestic violence. According to the police report, his wife fled to a
neighbour's house fearing for her safety after Johnson attacked her

'It is my sincere hope that he seeks the help he needs to overcome his troubles. Domestic violence is not okay and hopefully my taking a stand will help encourage other women to break their silence.'

Allegations: Dolphins star Chad 'Ochocino Johnson' has been charged with headbutting his new wife in a car in Davie, Florida

TMZ reported that she filed for divorce after just six weeks of marriage, claiming their marriage was 'irretrievably broken'.

Johnson
and his wife were at dinner when she confronted him about a receipt she
had found for a box of condoms, said Davie police Capt Dale Engle.

The argument got heated and continued on the drive home, he said. When they arrived in their driveway in Davie, the 34-year-old Johnson head-butted Lozada, she told police.

According
to the police report, Johnson started screaming at his wife, yelling, 
‘I don’t give a f***! I don’t give a f*** about my career!’

Fearing for her safety, Lozada fled to a neighbour’s house and called 911 from there.

In newly-released 911 call recordings, an unidentified male neighbor is heard 
speaking in hushed tones as he urges 
emergency operators to send police to his home but to avoid alerting the
press.

'I have somebody here at my house 
that was in a little domestic dispute with their husband and I think we 
need to have a police officer come over here and talk to her,' the 
neighbor says.

He says
that the woman had a 
'nice cut on her forehead'.

'I think it was just a misunderstanding but we're worried that he's going to come and get upset,' the neighbor explains in tapes on the The Miami Herald. 'I don't want the police to come with their lights on but I just want them to come until everybody calms down.'

Court appearance: Johnson appeared at Broward County court on Sunday morning, where he was charged with battery and domestic violence and had his bond set at $2,500 by Judge Mindy Solomon

The responding officer who filed the 
report said that Johnson admitted to having an argument but said that 
Lozada had head-butted him.

Lozada sustained a 3 inch laceration 
on her head while Johnson suffered no injuries. She was treated at a 
hospital for the cut to her forehead.

Johnson,
who changed his last name back to Johnson from Ochocinco after his July
4 wedding to Lozada, was held Saturday night in Broward County Jail.

He
was at 1 p.m. on Sunday on $2,500 bond after appearing in court that 
morning, where he was charged with battery and domestic violence.

His defense attorney, Adam Swickle, said a no-contact order has been issued that prevents Johnson from contacting Lozada.

It
is not the first time Johnson has been accused of attacking a woman, as
he was found guilty of hitting an ex girlfriend 12 years ago, when she 
accused him of cheating on her, TMZ reported.

Lovers' quarrel: The argument that ended in Johnson's arrest broke out when his wife, Evelyn Lozada, left, confronted him about finding a receipt for condoms

Johnson was arrested for misdemeanor domestic battery in L.A. on 
February 7, 2000 when he was 22 and just about to start playing football for Oregon 
State University, the website reported.

He
was sentenced to three years probation and ordered to serve 45 days in 
jail, but he struck a deal that allowed him to avoid the jail sentence 
for community work.

He was 
also required to complete a 12 month batterer's counseling program, 
which TMZ reported he failed to complete for years until the judge gave 
him more community service.

He has since 
stayed out of trouble with the law – a fact he mentions in his 2007 
autobiography Ocho Cinco: What Football And Life Have Thrown My Way, 
according to the site SB Nation.

In a passage addressing an alleged 
altercation with an NFL employee, Johnson writes: ‘You see, the 
funniest part is that people think I’m so bad, but do you see one arrest
on me since I got to the NFL?

'Do you see me getting suspended for using
drugs or steroids? Do you see anything about me beating up my 
girlfriend or some other guys? No, none of that.’

Switching teams: Johnson signed with the Dolphins in June, four days after he was released by the New England Patriots

Johnson signed a one-year deal with 
the Miami Dolphins - worth just under $1million - in June to revive his 
career after he was released by the New England Patriots - but the 
Dolphins have now cut ties with the wide receiver, after team officials 
met with him following his release from jail.

The team announced via the team's website and Twitter late Sunday that they terminated Johnson's contract.

A six-time Pro 
Bowl receiver with Cincinnati, he caught only 15 passes in 15 games for 
the Patriots last year after they acquired him in a trade for a pair of 
draft picks.

On Friday 
night in the Dolphins' 20-7 loss to Tampa Bay in the exhibition opener, 
Johnson let the only pass thrown to him slip through his hands.
