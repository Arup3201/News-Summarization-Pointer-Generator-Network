Even if Erik Lamela is unlikely to follow Roberto Soldado into the White Hart Lane confessional, he too has endured some difficult periods since arriving here in 2013.

He might not feel quite so ‘ashamed’ as his Spanish team-mate, who has been candid enough to admit that he cringes with embarrassment when fans sing his name, but the burden of a hefty price tag appears to have rested heavy on Lamela’s shoulders too.

Indeed, Lamela has had to cope with the additional pressure of being seen as a replacement for Gareth Bale; a wide player with the ability to score the kind of goals Bale used to provide.

Those goals have not arrived with the frequency his employers might have expected when they deposited £30million into Roma’s bank account. But the 22-year-old is at least demonstrating Bale’s talent for the spectacular, as he proved again here yesterday with a quite brilliant 35th-minute winner.

This one was straight from the Bale repertoire; a 25-yard curling left-foot shot that was hit on the move and with more than enough pace to elude Tom Heaton. For the scorer of that remarkable Rabona, it was also most welcome — and not just because it was his first Premier League goal. No, it was the fact that he was also largely responsible for Ashley Barnes’ similarly impressive equaliser after losing possession cheaply inside Tottenham’s half.

A first goal in 26 Premier League attempts will, nevertheless, come with a degree of relief, even if the young Argentine should take some comfort in the fact that Bale had to wait 24 games in England’s top flight before experiencing victory.

Mauricio Pochettino certainly felt the goal would do his countryman the power of good.

Harry Kane continued his fine form for Tottenham this season by firing them into the lead in the 21st minute - CLICK HERE for more stats with our brilliant Match Zone

‘Last season was very difficult for him, so that was important for him as a player,’ said the Tottenham manager. 

‘It will help him to build his confidence. He is a big talent but, when you are young, sometimes you need time to adapt to a new club and a new culture.’ As Pochettino acknowledged, Lamela was part of a potent forward line that performed well against a Burnley side now playing with more composure after collecting 11 points from their previous six games.

With Nacer Chadli on the left flank and Christian Eriksen deployed behind Harry Kane, Tottenham secured their third win in six days in some style.

Kane continues to grow in stature, underlining his claim to be Tottenham’s principal forward, not just because he scored the opening 21st-minute goal but because he also displayed excellent vision, control and a superb range of passing.

His 14th goal of the season irritated Sean Dyche, who complained for two reasons.

Firstly, because Eriksen — who made a point of not touching the ball and instead let it run through for the now advancing Nacer Chadli — was actually offside when Kane took a quick free-kick and, secondly, because he felt a free-kick should not have been awarded in the first place.

‘I actually can’t be bothered to get into the whole debate about whether Eriksen was interfering with play,’ said Dyche. ‘I’m more annoyed about the handball. It flicked off Kane and Keano [Michael Keane] could do nothing about it.’

The truth is, Burnley’s defenders should have played to the whistle. As it was, Kane covered the ground to meet Chadli’s cross inside the six-yard box and head home unopposed.

To Burnley’s credit they responded swiftly, their equaliser arriving within six minutes after Lamela lost the ball to David Jones. A neat pass forward from George Boyd followed before Barnes, so impressive in recent weeks in combination with Danny Ings, curled a stunning shot beyond the reach of Hugo Lloris.

No sooner had Burnley levelled than Tottenham might have scored again. Kane was presented with another close-range opportunity, this time thanks to Lamela, but contrived to miscue, before Eriksen — understandably surprised the ball had even reached him — blasted over the bar.

No doubt disappointed to see his efforts go to waste, Lamela decided to have a go himself after that — and with breathtaking results.

The loss of Ryan Mason to what Pochettino said he hoped was not too serious an ankle injury did little to disrupt Tottenham, the home side boasting 69 per cent of the possession and 13 shots to Burnley’s three by half-time.

That said, Lloris was forced to excel on more than one occasion after the break to protect Tottenham’s lead, in particular in the dying minutes, when he pushed a powerful free-kick from Ross Wallace to safety. 

It was a save that ensured Spurs remain very much in the hunt for the Champions League place they so crave.
