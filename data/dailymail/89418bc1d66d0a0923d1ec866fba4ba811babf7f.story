A former soldier has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his 21-year-old wife, police have confirmed.

Danielle Roberts was found dead in the Bristol flat she shared with her husband, ex-soldier James, 27.

The couple, who moved in together in Bedminster last year, wed just eight months ago at Bristol Register Office after dating for several years.

Their flat in West Street remains cordoned off with police tape, and officers say they are still treating Danielle's death last Thursday as unexplained.

Her devastated mother Cindy Hardiman has paid tribute to her 'bubbly' daughter, describing her death as 'a complete nightmare'.

'She was a bubbly girl and very kind-hearted. She would do anything for anybody,' said Mrs Hardiman, 49.

'She had a heart of gold, was very loving and concerned about everyone else all the time.

'She put others before herself - probably to a fault. Sometimes we had to tell her to stop and look after herself.'

Mrs Roberts' older sister Sam, 25, who has just had a baby son with her partner, said: 'We'll just have to wait for answers now to try and understand what happened. It's such a shame she didn't get to meet her nephew.'

She described her sister as having a 'cheeky glint'.

'She was definitely a bit naughty but in a way you couldn't get mad with her.

'She absolutely loved animals and singing. She made recordings and was first up on the karaoke if she had a few drinks. She wanted to work with animals or children.'

Danielle also leaves behind a brother, Aaron, 28.

Friends of Mrs Roberts have been 
paying tribute to her on Facebook, where Tamara Wardle posted the 
message: 'She is so beautiful. May the angels keep you safe xx'.

Lisa Coles added: 'Such a beautiful young lady...Rip x'.

Yesterday neighbours of Danielle, known as Danni, said news of her death had left them in shock.

Taylor Westlake, 20, lived in the flat next door to Danielle said she had known the 'lovely' brunette for almost a year.

'She always had her dog with her and would say "no nibbles just kisses", when he came up to me,' said Ms Westlake.

'It was such a shock when I heard, she was always so lovely and so kind. We both loved [the television programme] Charmed so she would always come and discuss an episode with me, she was absolutely lovely.

'When she first moved in she came right up to me and introduced herself right away, she was always so talkative and happy.

'James was lovely too, they were both such a nice couple.'

Mrs Roberts lived in the top floor flat in West Street with her husband James, their cat Rocky and dog Milo.

A spokesman for Avon and Somerset police confirmed a man had been arrested on suspicion of murder but had since been bailed while inquiries continue.

He added: 'Late on Thursday night police and ambulance were called to flats on West Street in Bedminster

'A woman had died and an investigation is underway to establish the circumstances of her death. It is currently being treated as unexplained.'

A spokeswoman for South Western Ambulance Service said they were called at 11.36pm on Thursday to reports of an unconscious female.

She said: 'We arrived at the scene of a female who was unconscious and wasn't breathing and she was unfortunately deceased at the scene. Police attended.'

A spokesman for Avon Coroner's Court said an inquest had not yet been opened.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
