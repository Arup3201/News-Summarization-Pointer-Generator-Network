Exeter  wing Jack Nowell will return to England’s starting XV in Dublin on Sunday at the expense of Jonny May.

May was released back to Gloucester on Tuesday night, paying the price for a glaring lapse against Italy at Twickenham when he failed to capitalise on a three-on-one overlap.

Nowell has been operating at outside centre for Exeter and was in electric form as the Chiefs swept to victory at Harlequins last weekend. He was a fixture in the senior team during last year’s RBS 6 Nations and scored a maiden Test try against Italy in Rome. But that was his last appearance as injuries checked his progress. He damaged a shoulder and, during the enforced break, had surgery on a knee problem.

England have started to use the choke tackle more often with flanker James Haskell leading from the front 

Nowell, 21, is likely to be part of a back-three unit showing two changes as Alex Goode is on standby to take over from Mike Brown if, as feared, the Quins full-back fails to recover from concussion in time.

Chris Pennell of Worcester is another full-back in a trimmed-down squad of 26 but he is there merely to gain experience. Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood and Geoff Parling have all returned to training after injuries but have been sent back to their clubs to play in the Aviva Premiership.

With Newcastle tighthead prop Kieran Brookes nursing a hip strain, Bath’s Henry Thomas is poised to take over as a replacement.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘Preparation has gone well. We’ve had to make some tough decisions but it’s a good position to be in. Those players going back to their clubs have another big weekend ahead to lay down a marker for later in the tournament.’ 

Rowntree pinpointed hooker Rory Best and lock Paul O'Connel as key 'chokers' in the Irish team 

The choke tackle involves a defender wrapping his arms around the neck and chest of the ball-carrier — often one who is isolated and too upright — and preventing him from going to ground. With assistance from team-mates, this can lead to the ball being stripped or a maul forming, which can produce a penalty to the defending team if the opposition collapse it in their bid retrieve the ball. If a maul forms and the ball doesn’t emerge, the defending team will win the put-in at the subsequent scrum. 

Meanwhile England plan to use Ireland’s favourite weapon — the choke tackle — against their rivals on Sunday.

While the Irish long ago mastered the art of holding up isolated runners to win turnovers and penalties, now England have acquired the knack, led by the recalled Wasps captain in their back row, James Haskell. The order from Lancaster and his assistants will be to carry on choking, but not to overplay it.

‘It’s a powerful tool if a team can do it well — stand you up there and quickly get mass under the body,’ said forwards coach Graham Rowntree.

‘We’ve done it more of late. We’ve got a couple of personnel in our team now who are good at it and maybe weren’t in our team six to 10 months ago. But it’s been around for six years. You’ve got to employ it at the right time. We encourage our guys that they can choke, but they have to do it appropriately, at the right time. If you do it wrong you just get danced back for five metres, it goes into a ruck and you’ve lost territory. But if you get it right, it’s a hell of a tactic.’

Rowntree initially refused to identify the leading English exponents of the ploy but eventually mentioned Haskell, adding: ‘It’s not limited to him. Billy Twelvetrees won a crucial penalty at the end of the Wales game with the same tactic.’

Rowntree pointed to three key Irish chokers — two of whom are available to face England. ‘For Ireland, Best, Heaslip and O’Connell are all good at it,’ he said, before paying tribute to the young England lock who will go toe to toe with Paul O’Connell: George Kruis of Saracens.

Injuries to Lawes and Joe Launchbury left the coaches with a problem but Kruis has been the solution, first in the autumn and lately in victories over Wales and Italy. He is making a powerful case for a World Cup place.

Kruis, 25, revealed that when O’Connell was leading the Lions in South Africa six years ago he was cheering from the stands as a teenage prospect on a playing stint in Cape Town.

Asked if he ever imagined that one day he would find himself up against O’Connell, Kruis said: ‘It was a very distant dream. I was rather underweight and not the best rugby player. I weighed less than our backs coach.’

A notable victory was secured by campaigners in the House of Lords on Tuesday that will curb online ticket touting ahead of the Rugby World Cup and the Ashes series this summer.

Proposals for a provision in the Consumer Act — to ensure that tickets traded online include block, row and seat number plus the face value — had previously been rejected by the House of Commons.

But the persistence of the House of Lords, backed by cricket’s ECB and rugby’s RFU ruling bodies, led to the Government’s capitulation on the issue yesterday.

The new regulations will be in place in time for the start of the Ashes series in July.
