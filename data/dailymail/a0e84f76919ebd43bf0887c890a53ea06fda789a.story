A multi-millionaire who pledged £1million to Ukip after defecting from the Tories was at the centre of a harassment row with a female employee.

Insurance tycoon Arron Banks, 48, was arrested over given an official warning over his pursuit of 33-year-old Jo Featherby, who he first hired as an 18-year-old waitress.

Mr Banks, who wants to stand as a Ukip candidate, was unveiled by Nigel Farage earlier this month as the party’s latest star recruit

Arron Banks was arrested and handed an official warning from the police after being accused of harassing a female employee 

He allegedly offered her boyfriend Andy Giles £30,000 to end his relationship with her.

A friend told the Sun on Sunday: ‘Banks made her life hell. He would stop at nothing to make her be his girlfriend.

When Ms Featherby complained to police she was dismissed from insurance company GoSkippy — linked to Banks's firm Brightside.

Mr Banks told the newspaper that he had agreed with police not to contract Ms Featherby following the harassment claims.

The friend said: ‘Banks had been pursuing Jo ever since first hiring her when she was an 18-year-old barmaid at his local pub.

‘Even then he was trying underhand tactics like ensuring flowers were delivered to her while she was with her boyfriend. She left but later joined one of his firms and was eventually promoted to run a team of 60 sales staff.’

Mr Banks was accompanied by Mr Farage and party chairman Steve Crowther when he made the announcement at a press conference at a country hotel near Bristol 

The insurance tycoon planned to give Nigel Farage's party £100,000 - but upped the donation after William Hague called him a 'nobody'

Ms Featherby, from Bristol, launched employment tribunal proceedings alleging unfair dismissal and harassment. But she later agreed an out-of-court settlement gagging her from speaking out.

The revelation are a blow to Ukip ahead of next month’s crunch Rochester by-election, triggered by the defection of rebel backbench MP Mark Reckless.

Mr Banks was unveiled to the national press at a special event in Bristol on the final day of the Conservative Party conference earlier this month.

He announced he was handing the party £1million to fight the next election - because he was angry at being called a 'nobody' by William Hague.

Mr Banks, who has previously given tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservatives, said he was only going to give Nigel Farage's party £100,000 - but decided to increase it by £900,000 after Mr Hague's jibe.

The revelations over Mr Banks come after Ukip's first elected MP Douglas Carswell took up his seat in the House of Commons last week

The announcement, timed to disrupt David Cameron's set-piece party conference speech, came after the Tories were left stunned by the double defection of rebel backbenchers Douglas Carswell and Mr Reckless.

Mr Banks — who has split from his Russian wife — told The Sun on Sunday: ‘After events all got very heated she made these allegations against me. It was agreed mutually with the police that I wouldn't contact her again.

‘Jo Featherby was a long-term employee of ours who had horrendous personal problems with her boyfriend.’

Police confirmed: ‘A 46-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of harassment on August 9, 2012. He was issued with a harassment notice and words of advice.’

A Ukip spokeswoman said: ‘He's done nothing illegal.’

Tory MP Tracey Crouch said: ‘Ukip should not take money from people who treat women this way.’
