A fearless artist has gone to extreme lengths for the perfect self portrait - dangling off skyscrapers.

Jun Ahn, from Seoul, South Korea, has travelled to the top of some of the biggest buildings in her native city, New York and Hong Kong to sit, stand, perch and pose at dizzying heights.

In some of the daring artworks, viewers are afforded stomach churning vertical views of Jun's feet dangling hundreds of feet above the bustling city streets below, while others show her gingerly peering over the edge.

Jun, 32, takes the images using setting up cameras with self timers to capture her in the extreme positions.

'People always ask whether the images are real and in all these pictures I was actually there, not photoshopped. Of course it is not a safe situation. But I always try to be careful,' she said.

'I have never been brave. It is a matter of overcoming the fear.'

She started the project in 2008 and has scaled around 14 skyscrapers and apartment blocks.

But despite her death-defying antics, the full-time photographer is more amazed at the lack of awareness people on the ground show.

'I only saw people notice me on two occasions,' Jun added.

'The first time, a lady was just staring up at me. The second time, a family who were having BBQ party at the rooftop of the building beside my window saw me.

'But I was surprised that not many people look up when they were walking on the street.'

Jun says that throughout the four years she took the images, very few people looked up and noticed her as she posed
