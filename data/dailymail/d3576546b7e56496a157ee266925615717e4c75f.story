It was a deal that made headlines around the world. Kissing Coppers – the celebrated Banksy mural which shows two uniformed policemen locked in an embrace – was sold at auction in Miami last week for £345,000.

But now it has emerged that the mystery buyer of the life-size black-and-white image may have purchased a work that was created with the help of a Brighton barman called Jez.

Kissing Coppers first appeared on the wall of a pub in the seaside town in 2004. But two years later it was vandalised and all but obliterated.

Staff at the Prince Albert did a hasty restoration job with the assistance of Jez the bartender, who touched up the damaged paintwork so effectively that customers joked he could be the next Banksy.

The work was then placed behind a sheet of Perspex to protect it.

In 2008, however, the mural was removed by specialists and replaced with a replica. The landlord of the Prince Albert, Chris Steward, sent the original to New York in 2011, with a view to finding a buyer.

When Kissing Coppers was auctioned on Tuesday, there was no mention of its chequered history – an omission that has left punters at the Prince Albert baffled.

They recalled the day in October 2006
 when two men in a plumber’s van pulled up outside the pub and sprayed 
black paint over the mural.

Paul Zenon, who lives in Brighton and is a regular at the Prince Albert, said: ‘The damage was awful.

The pub tried to clean off the paint but the scrubbing pretty much erased the copper on the left.

‘One night, I was going past the pub and I saw a barman called Jez touching up the damaged paintwork.

'He was repainting it. Jez did a really good job. I joked with him that he could be the next Banksy.’

Mr Zenon, who is a professional magician, said he was stunned when he heard Kissing Coppers had been sold for such a large sum.

‘It can’t be claimed to be the original. Banksy’s work might be 
underneath it all, but the paint you can see was done by the fair hand 
of a barman.

'It seems incredible that it could be considered to be a genuine Banksy.

‘But I guess if you’ve got that much money to buy an airbrushed piece  of graffiti you’ve probably got more money than sense.’

The
 paint attack was captured by CCTV and Peter Wheatley and Paul Biggs 
pleaded guilty to criminal damage in 2006. They were given a six-month 
conditional discharge.

The work was eventually extracted from the wall and put on sale in a fine art auction in Miami, Florida

When he was planning the New York deal, landlord Chris Steward explained: ‘When Banksy put it on the pub, it belonged to the pub and, if it is sold, all the money will go back to the pub.’

Mr Steward declined to discuss the 
matter this week and a spokesman for Banksy said the reclusive artist 
would not be commenting on the controversy.

The
 Miami auction house says  in its catalogue: ‘First painted in  2004 in 
Brighton, England, on the side of the Prince Albert Pub, the Kissing 
Coppers is estimated between $500,000 (£300,000) and $700,000 
(£420,000).

The original street work is 89 x 65 x 3.5in, stencil and spraypaint on emulsion and aluminium substrate.’

A spokesman for the auctioneer said: ‘Fine Art Auctions is in the business of selling original artwork.

They are satisfied it is 100 per cent original and they do not want to comment any further.’
