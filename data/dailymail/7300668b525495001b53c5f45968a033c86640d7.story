Kate visited the Road to 2012: Aiming High exhibition

She wore a distinctive gold hooped necklace, electric blue Stella McCartney dress and black Prada heels

She is known as the Discount Duchess for her love of the High Street.

But Kate proved that even she can’t resist the allure of something gold – in the form of a £49,000 Cartier necklace.

The Duchess of Cambridge wore the  distinctive piece, made up of a series of chains linked to five diamond-studded hoops, to an Olympics-themed exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery yesterday.

According to 
royal aides, the white, yellow and rose gold necklace from the 
jeweller’s Trinity range has been part of her private collection for a 
while.

Although it was 
not specifically designed for the Games, Kate thought it was  
‘appropriate’ to wear to the exhibition, called The Road To 2012: Aiming
 High.

A St James’s 
Palace spokesman said: ‘It’s a personal piece which she’s had for some 
time. It’s not an official Olympic item but it’s appropriate to wear 
it.’

Kate also used 
the occasion to fly the flag for British fashion by choosing a brilliant
 blue crepe dress by Stella McCartney, who created the official Team GB 
kit. She topped off the £515 frock with her trusty black Prada heels, 
which she has worn before.

Kate was given a sneak preview of the exhibition, which follows athletes and staff in the build-up to London 2012.

Among those 
photographed are the men’s rowing eight, London Mayor Boris Johnson – 
and the duchess herself. The black and white portrait was taken earlier 
this year when Kate played hockey at the Olympic park.

Photographer 
Jillian Edelstein, who took the picture, said: ‘She looked a little 
embarrassed and said she thought it would be just her hitting a few 
balls with the players.

‘She is 
beautiful – it must be difficult to take a bad photograph of her. She 
has a very easy, warm way about her which comes out in her pictures. She
 was a delight.’

exhibition herself in a black and white photograph taken by Jillian

year.

The Duchess also 
popped in to see a couple of the other exhibitions and viewed footage of
 a bare chested sleeping David Beckham taken by Sam Taylor wood.

She also viewed the NPG's Diamond Jubilee Exhibition on The Queen, Art and Image.

Today’s engagement was the first of several involving the
Duchess over the coming weeks with an Olympic theme.

Kate was visiting the gallery, of which she is patron, to
view a new exhibition entitled Road to 2012: Aiming High.

It is the final – and largest – part of the NPG’s
three-year Olympic-themed project, which has documented the preparations for
London 2012.

Working with several internationally renowned
photographers, it has created a lasting record of the people who are
contributing to the summer’s events, from world-class athletes and those
working behind the scenes, to people living and working in the host boroughs
for the 2012 Games.

The current exhibition showcases more than 100 portraits
by Anderson & Low, Jillian Edelstein and Nadav Kander following the final
stages of the preparations.

The photographs range highly crafted images of athletes'
physical perfection and endurance to documentary-style pictures of those living
and working the East of London.

Royal aides said the Duchess had been looking forward to
viewing the exhibition ‘immensely’ as she is a keen photographer herself.

Kate, who is known for her love of photography, seemed to be enjoying herself on her visit to the gallery

The Prince of Wales is understood to be encouraging his daughter-in-law to pursue her love for photography

She wrote her history of art degree dissertation at St
Andrew’s University on the photography of the Alice in Wonderland author, Lewis
Carroll.

In 2007, she also curated an exhibition of celebrity
portraits by the photographer Alistair Morrison at a London gallery.

Morrison, who has many of his portraits on display in the
NPG and has worked with the Duchess on her photography, has said of her work:
‘She is very, very good, and it shows. She takes beautiful, detailed
photographs.’

Before marrying Prince William last year, the Duchess
worked for her parents’ mail order partyware business, Party Pieces, where her
roles included catalogue design and photography.

And during her inaugural royal tour of Canada and
California last year, the Duchess was often seen with her camera, taking
personal pictures of their trip.

The Prince of Wales is understood to be encouraging his
daughter-in-law to pursue her love for photography and there has even been talk
of her staging an exhibition of her work in aid of some of her charitable
causes.

The Duchess of Cambridge may have made the most high profile appearance 
of the day, but this was by far a day off for the rest of the senior 
Royals.

Lately
 it seems as though not a day goes by without an engagement for the 
Queen, who at 86 seems to be working harder than ever before.

The
 Queen and Prince Philip were in Leeds where they met the crowds during a walkabout on Briggate in Leeds city centre as part of the Diamond Jubilee Tour.
