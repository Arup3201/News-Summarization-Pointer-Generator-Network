A family of four have been killed by the monster tornado that roared through Oklahoma on Monday, claiming 24 lives, with dozens still missing, feared dead and hundreds of people injured.

The family, who have not yet been identified, were killed as they scrambled to seek shelter from the storm in a freezer, KFOR reported.

It was one of many heartbreaking stories that emerged in the hours after a deadly tornado ripped through the town of Moore along with incredible tales of survival.

237 people are still being treated at hospital with many suffering critical injuries. Dozens of homes were flattened and people began the slow process of trying to re-piece together their lives. 

Lando Hite, found shirtless and covered in dirt by a KFOR reporter, was trudging along what was left of his horse farm.

He told the station: 'I lost everything. We might have one horse left out of all of them.'

He added that he sought refuge in one
 of the horse stables and waited out the storm. When the storm passed, 
about 100 of his horses were dead.

He described the tornado was 'unbearably loud' and 'straight out of the movie Twister.'

Appearing on KFOR, one woman credited her son’s teacher at Briarwood Elementary School, with saving her son’s life.

She said that Cynthia Lowe, who teaches first grade, lifted a wall off the boy as the tornado pummeled the school.

Brady, a sixth grade student at Briarwood, said that he and other students ran into a bathroom to escape from the storm.

'Cinderblocks
 and everything collapsed on them but they were underneath so that kind 
of saved them a little bit, but I mean they were trapped in there,' he 
told KOCO-TV.

One woman who was overcome with emotion, told CBS affiliate KWTV: 'Everything is gone... Our whole house is gone.'

She got into a bathtub with her young children and had to grab her daughter’s hair  as the strong winds tried to pull her away.

Steve Wilkerson told CNN that he is in shock over what happened.

'[I] can’t believe it happened. We had about 30 minutes to evacuate. It happened real fast... It's unreal.'

One woman in Moore said she and other neighbors tried desperately to find any survivors, but were met with tragedy.

She told KFOR: 'We just started 
grabbing and throwing debris to get anybody out. And we successfully got
 people out, just not alive.'

One mother spoke of her desperation as she tried to round up her family after the tornado hit, and her relief when she realized they were OK.

She told CNN: 'As soon as I walked through the building I mean I was a little hysterical. I was running through the building barefoot and just screaming their names and each one of my kids stood up and they came with me.'

Another woman in Moore, Elizabeth, told KFOR that she was on her way to work as the storm was looming, and decided to turn around and return home - for her dog.

She told the station: 'I was actually speeding on the highway - and the cops can give me tickets I don’t care.

Elizabeth got home right in the nick of time, and was able to get into a bathtub with her dog Ginger as the twister struck her home.

She was thrown around by the wind – and hit her head – but she’s thankful that she and her dog survived.

'I mean, risking my life for an animal – I don't have a problem doing it because I’m an animal person.'

It was good news for Barbara Garcia, who survived the tornado but was horrified when her dog did not answer her calls.

But during an interview with CBS News, she found her dog – alive – under the heavy rubble that was once her home.

Survivor Heather Moore told CNN's Piers Morgan that the experience was 'really, really terrifying,' adding that the storm sounded 'like a train passing over you.'

One couple face an uncertain wait to discover whether their friends and neighbours have escaped the devastation. Todd and Jennifer Tabor evacuated their home in Moore before the tornado hit their neighbourhood and are know anxiously waiting until they can return.

Mr Tabor told NBC Nightly News: 'I was at work in Midwest City and I saw all this blow up so I headed towards Moore. I told Jennifer and my daughter that they needed to get out of the house and take cover as it was heading their way.

'As soon as I can I'm going to walk into the neighbourhood to see what kind of damage has been done and see if there's anyone that needs help and what's going on.'

Todd and Jennifer Tabor, residents of Moore, are unsure about their loved ones. Mrs Tabor fled her home after a warning from her husband

His wife Jennifer added: 'We have no idea (what is happening). We see the helicopters above our position but we have no idea. The cellphone service isn't working and we have no way to contact loved ones.'

Oklahoma Highway 
Patrol spokeswoman Betsy Randolph described some of the injuries as 
'grotesque,' adding: 'We do have hope. We are seeing people crawling out
 of vehicles...crawling out of buildings.'

Dozens
 of people were injured in a huge tornado that flattened parts of Moore on Monday, according to officials of three hospitals.

At least 91 people have been confirmed dead, with a grim death toll inside the demolished school.

The bodies of seven children were reportedly found in a pool, where they had drowned.

Officials at two hospitals say they're treating nearly 150 patients.

‘Our hearts are broken for the parents that are wondering about the state of their children that had been in the schools that have been hit,' Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin said last night.

'I know that there are families wondering where their loved ones are.'

She added that rescuers were 'looking under every single piece of debris' for the missing.
