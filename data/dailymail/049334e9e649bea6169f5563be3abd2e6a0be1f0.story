She may have turned her nose up at her school dinners, creating a blog to share her lunchtime woes online.

But there was no such concerns for nine-year-old Martha Payne when she tucked into a school meal in Malawi, beaming her approval on a visit to a project her 'NeverSeconds' blog helped raise funds for.

Posting pictures of the lunches served at her school, Martha soon attracted contributions from children around the world, and came to the attention of politicians and celebrity chefs alike when the local council attempted to ban her from blogging in June 2012.

'Awesome': Martha Payne tucks into porridge with children at Lirangwe primary school in Malawi

Now Martha has travelled from her home in Lochgilphead, Argyll, to Africa to have breakfast with 2,000 schoolchildren at a kitchen funded by her fans' donations.

Martha was overwhelmed when the grateful youngsters sang her name and cheered as she arrived at Lirangwe Primary School, near Blantyre.

She was  guest of honour for the opening of a special kitchen run by Mary’s Meals, a Scottish charity which runs school feeding projects in communities around the world.

He father, Dave, 40, said: ‘There were some tears in the bus on the way here because it was just so overwhelming.

‘Martha really struggled to take it all in and we couldn’t believe it with all the children singing her name and desperate to meet her.

‘It’s too much to take in but it’s just absolutely incredible to see the kitchen and know that it was built with money raised from Martha’s blog.

‘It really does bring tears to your eyes when you see these children’s gratitude for what Martha has done to help them.’

Martha’s blog became a global internet phenomenon in June and fans of the website donated more than £114,500 on the JustGiving site that Martha set up to raise money for Mary’s Meals.

The charity used the money to build the kitchen, which daily feeds a special high-protein porridge to the youngsters.

During her visit, Martha joined pupils for a maths lesson, painted a name sign for the new building, and helped local volunteers to make the huge pots of porridge and dish it out – before sampling some herself.

She said: ‘I woke up really excited because this was the day I’d been waiting for.

‘I was a bit nervous when I saw all the children waiting but it was awesome to see the kitchen finished and to paint the sign.

‘It was really nice of them to sing my name when we got to the school.

‘The porridge was yummy, although it was a bit hot – but I really liked it.’

During her four-hour visit to Lirangwe, Martha met Gilbert, a 14-year-old homeless orphan who has already written a message of thanks to her.

He said: ‘I wrote to her because I was so happy at the good things she has done.

‘Martha has brought food to us and I just want to thank her for everything she has done for our lives in Malawi.’

Gilbert,
who has been sleeping rough since his fisherman father was killed by a 
crocodile six years ago, has big ambitions. He said: ‘I go to school to 
learn to read and write because one day I want to be president of 
Malawi. Then my people would have food and I would stop all their 
suffering.’

Food for thought: Martha posted this picture on an internet blog and began to add daily snaps of her lunches, rating and commenting on them
