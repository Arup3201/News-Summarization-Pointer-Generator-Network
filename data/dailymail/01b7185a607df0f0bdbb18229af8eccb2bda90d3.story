The parents of a nine-year-old girl who began slurring her speech were horrified when doctors confirmed she had suffered a stroke.

Lianne Kidd said she knew something was wrong when her daughter Millie fell ill and her speech became incomprehensible.

She rushed her to hospital, where 10 days later tests revealed the shocking news that Millie had survived a stroke.

Lianne Kidd knew something was wrong when her daughter Millie felt ill and started slurring her speech 'like a drunk person'. She rushed her to hospital, where tests revealed Millie had suffered a stroke

Strokes are rare at such a young age and occur in only around three in every 100,000 under 16-year-olds.

Mrs Kidd said: 'Millie was off school one day because she was feeling poorly.

'We took her to the doctors, but they said it was nothing and not to worry.

'But she was slurring her speech like a drunk person, which just isn’t right, so I decided to take her to hospital.'

Doctors at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Hampshire ran tests and an MRI scan to see what was causing Millie’s illness.

Millie has a protein deficiency, which causes her blood to clot quicker and leads to a higher risk of strokes

Further tests discovered the youngster has a protein deficiency, which causes her blood to clot quicker and leads to a higher risk of strokes.

Most strokes occur when a blood clot blocks one of the arteries (blood vessels) that carries blood to the brain.

Ms Kidd, from Waterlooville, Hants, said: 'I was absolutely shocked and stunned when I was told the news.

'I never even realised children could have strokes.

'My dad had a stroke in March last year at the age of 54, and I remember thinking he wasn’t old enough to have a stroke. He was overweight and it was a contributing factor.

'He was going into work with slurred speech, before he went to hospital.

'But even though Millie had slurred speech for 48 hours, I never made the connection.'

Luckily, Millie’s stroke caused no lasting damage and she now takes tablets to thin her blood.

Millie said: 'I was scared and quite upset, I didn’t know what to do, if to worry or cry. I understood about strokes a bit because of my grandad, but I was still scared.

Young stroke survivors’ charity Different Strokes have been supporting Millie’s family following the shock diagnosis.

Dr Amanda Freeman, a consultant paediatrician at the Queen Alexandra Hospital, said: 'Children usually have a stroke because they have an underlying health problem.

'With adults, it can be due to high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes or high cholesterol.

'The outlook for children is better than adults, and we’d tell any parents who suspect there is a problem to visit their GP straight away.'
