Gareth Southgate has delivered a stark warning to England’s young hopefuls, saying they will have no international future unless they show total commitment to his project.

The Under 21 head coach names his squad for the forthcoming Euro 2015 qualifiers against Lithuania and Moldova on Thursday but it is unlikely to contain Everton’s John Stones or Arsenal’s Calum Chambers. Both defenders are expected to be selected for senior duty.

There will also be no place for Wilfried Zaha or Ravel Morrison. They were key players in Southgate’s early games in charge but have slipped out of contention, while others like Swansea’s Jonjo Shelvey and Conor Wickham of Sunderland have never been selected.

Senior duty: Young defender Calum Chambers and John Stones are expected to be selected by England

Manchester United winger Zaha, who last week was caught speeding in his £188,000 Lamborghini Gallardo in Surrey, withdrew from the last squad Southgate selected to face Wales in May due to a minor injury, while West Ham midfielder Morrison has had his own fitness problems.

But until the pair prove they are up to speed physically and ready to dedicate themselves, Southgate will stick with the group that has taken England to the brink of next summer’s tournament in the Czech Republic.

‘The door will always be open for lads to work their way back in,’ said Southgate. ‘But we want to be world champions and to get there it is going to take a certain mindset. We have a group of players who have that mindset.

‘If players don’t match that mentality and people pull out of squads, others will come in. It will be hard to get back in.

‘We had some boys who over the course of last year did not necessarily buy into what we wanted to do. I am only prepared to work with players who are committed to being the best they can be. There has to be a commitment to the international programme and a recognition of the values. We are not running a community programme. This is an elite sporting environment.

‘Not everybody has wanted to be where Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole have been. That is why they have got 100 caps and won the Champions League; they have been prepared to commit to being the very best. They are world class for a reason.’

Gerrard believes Raheem Sterling has the potential to win 100 caps and Southgate feels the Liverpool winger has an outstanding chance of reaching that target because of his mentality.

Sterling is still eligible for Under 21 duty but Southgate feels he has graduated to the seniors. ‘He is a boy who posts a picture of himself in the gym straight after coming back from the World Cup so that tells you what he is like and something about his mentality,’ said Southgate. ‘The way he has started with Liverpool tells you that he doesn’t think, “Oh that was good, I’ve made it”.

‘It looks like he has had a taste of it and he likes it and he wants to go again. He is a tough kid and he wants to be the best he can.’
