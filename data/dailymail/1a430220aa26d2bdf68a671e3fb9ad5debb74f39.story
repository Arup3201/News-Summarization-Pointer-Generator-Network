Margaery Tyrell is the poster girl for hit American fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones.

But fans don't have to just watch the HBO show to catch a glimpse of her - pop into a coffee shop in Norway and you'll find her doppleganger.

Trine Ericzon was constantly mistaken for Natalie Dormer, the actress who plays her in the TV series, and after endless comparisons, Trine decided if she couldn't beat her she might as well join her and transformed herself into Margaery.

It's a Game Of Thrones clone: Trine Ericzon, 25, is an amazing dead-ringer of character Margaery Tyrell, played by Natalie Dormer

Since then, the 25 year old has amassed thousands of followers and receives fan mail from admirers around the globe.

Trine from Trondheim, Norway said: 'I'm a huge fan of Game of Thrones and I had been told that I look a lot like Natalie Dormer. The comparisons remained in the back of my mind.

Fan base: Since dressed up as Margaery, the 25-year-old has amassed thousands of followers and receives fan mail from admirers around the globe

Uncanny: Trine, left, dressed up as Margaery, right, at a costume event and received so much attention, she has been dressing as her ever since

Believable: The best reaction she got to her transformation was at a Comic con event in London where some boys came running down the hallway, convinced that she was Natalie

'When Game of Thrones was announced as the theme at a local cosplaying convention two years ago, all of my friends encouraged me to go as Margaery and so I did.'

In order to look the part, Trine hand-designed over five dresses based on Margaery's costumes. She also spent two hours on her hair and make-up - and the transformation was a hit.

Trine, who works full-time as a barista at a coffee shop, said: 'I really did not expect the amount of attention I suddenly received as Margaery. And the attention only increases as Natalie Dormer gets more popular as an actress.

'The best reaction I got to my transformation was at a Comic con event in London. Some guys came running down the hallway, convinced that I was Natalie herself!'

Not only is Trine the spitting image of Margaery, she also acts just like her.

Trine explains: 'Being such a big fan of the show gives me a strong motivation to be a credible Margaery.

'It's very important to me that I'm convincing in my behavior as well as my looks. I take great efforts to mentally prepare myself for the role so I'm just like the Game of Thrones character herself.'

Despite looking like Natalie Dormer's long-lost twin, Trine says she is yet to meet the actress.

She said: 'I feel such a connection to Margaery and it would be amazing to meet Natalie Dormer. I think I would probably faint if I did.'
