How Per Mertesacker must long for the days when he danced onto stage with the World Cup in front of an adoring crowd of half a million in Berlin.

That was in July, a few weeks before his return to Arsenal and the promise of a season in which he would silence the doubters and prove his worth as a world champion.

There was, to begin with, a World Cup hangover. But six months on and his sobering performance has left Arsenal fans and Arsene Wenger nursing a banging headache.

During Wednesday’s disastrous 3-1 defeat at home to Monaco, Mertesacker was at his indecisive and lumbering worst. And this, don’t forget, was Arsenal’s captain.

For Geoffrey Kondogbia’s opener – deflected in via the German – he was lethargic in his closing of the France midfielder and his limp body was an all-too-easy detour on its path to goal.

A John Terry, for example, would surely have closed with more aggression and purpose.

Mertesacker continued to dither and unnerve until his fatal involvement in Monaco’s tie-changing second.

For reasons only known to the 30-year-old, he chose to chase possession inside the opposition half, a pursuit which was always destined to fail. And so it did.

Monaco broke, Mertesacker was a spectator and Dimitar Berbatov – the former Fulham reserve – climaxed their attack with a cool finish.

But that was extinguished after Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco punished more defensive laxity to make it 3-1

In the aftermath of the concession the cameras cut to the forlorn centre-back – for it took a few seconds to locate him on halfway. But his face was pained, remorseful for his part in the goal.

Even for the tie-clinching third he was slow to close the scorer, although he had been left brutally exposed by the shortcomings of his team-mates.

Ironically, Mertesacker’s best performance was saved for the post-match rallying cry he issued ahead of the second leg in Monaco.

‘Let's try to raise everyone's level at Monaco. Let's try to get in our rhythm there. We could have scored more than three goals last night and we can hurt them,’ he said.

‘We have to focus on that. We can't look back and think too much about this game. We will analyse what went wrong, but when we travel to Monaco we have to be on the front foot, be brave and get the best out of ourselves.’

Mertesacker can only hope they do not spend too long poring over the ills of the first leg, for he would take star billing in any DVD nasty.

Leadership – and, for a second time, let us remind ourselves he is the captain – comes from the heart of a defence.

But Mertesacker has cut a subdued and sulky figure all season. Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher tore into him following his abdication of responsibility during the 3-2 defeat at Stoke.

It didn’t take forensic inspection to determine just how bad he was that afternoon. Nor does it take analysis from the game’s sharpest minds to pinpoint the weakness in Arsenal’s side right now.

Indeed, from stumbling giraffes to turning cargo ships, Mertesacker was the subject of social-media ridicule in the hours after the loss to Monaco.

How he must long for the days of summer.
