Ten feet underground covered by slabs of turf, this barren concrete cell was Mussolini’s secret wartime bunker.

Newly emerged photos document the fortified bolthole that could be reached by the fascist dictator in seconds in the event of an assassination attempt by the Allies.

The 180ft long converted wine cellar, deep beneath his former home in Rome, is to open to the public for the first time this week.

Mussolini ordered its construction in 1940 because he suspected that the RAF was planning a deadly strike on his home at Villa Torlonia. He was right.

The shelter had three different escape routes: by the theatre, in a shaft by the tennis court and underneath a pond.

It was also equipped with a double set of steel, gas-proof doors, and a sophisticated air filtering system that could provide oxygen for 15 people for 3-6 hours.

But Marco Placidi, president of 'Underground Rome', said really it wasn’t as secure as Mussolini's later, more hi-tech bunkers, because it was only a few metres underground.

He added: ‘And it must have been very inconvenient because the bunker was located in the garden some 100-150 metres away from the living quarters.’

Now the historic site is set to be opened to the public.

When the fascist leader began to believe that his life was under threat he had some 12 bunkers for the private use of him and his family built all over Rome in preparation for an allied bombardment.

In fact it was in July 1943 the Commander of the Royal Air Force (RAF) asked permission from Winston Churchill to eliminate Il Duce.

Their plan was to simultaneously bomb his official residence, Villa Torlonia and fascist HQ in Piazza Venezia.

But Foreign Minister Anthony Eden had doubts about the plot’s success and feared the collateral damage on civilians and the Eternal City.

Last year engineers carrying out maintenance work on the foundations of former fascist headquarters came across an iron hatch which led to another unknown bunker.

There are no official records of the unfinished bunker which was designed only for Mussolini himself and his mistress, Claretta Petacci.

Mussolini was exiled from Rome in 1943 and fled to the Apennine mountains. He was rescued by Nazis but his safety was shortlived - in April 1945 both he and Petacci were captured by partisans and executed.
