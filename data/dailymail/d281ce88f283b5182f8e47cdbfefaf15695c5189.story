50 Cent had his birthday celebrations ruined on Wednesday night after his fighter Mark Davis had his unbeaten bout record ended by Michael Farenas from the Phillipines.

The rapper/actor/boxing promoter had arranged the bout as part of a fight night in Connecticut, USA broadcast on ESPN as part of the festivities for his 39th birthday.

But it was spoiled for him after the Filipino fighter dominated Davis throughout and eventually stopped him in the eighth round.

The win improved 30-year-old Farenas' record to 39 win from 47 fight, including 32 knockouts. And more importantly, his victory puts him in line to challenge for the IBF Junior Lightweight belt later this year.

For the previously unbeaten Davis, however, it is back to the drawing board for him and his promoter, as they look to rebuild following the setback.

Here's hoping, though, that 50 Cent still managed to enjoy his birthday.
