The traditional Whitehall civil service is being swept aside by massive spending cuts which have seen more officials fired in 18 months than in four years under Margaret Thatcher

Whitehall mandarins claim spending cuts are going too fast and have been so severe that one department judges it a success that no member of staff has committed suicide.

An extraordinary report into the civil service morale reveals the ‘fragile’ state some officials say they are in after the coalition successfully cut  thousands of jobs in just 18 months.

Staff involved in making cuts have been threatened with ‘physical violence’ and one department ‘viewed not having a staff suicide as a success measure’, according to the study by the Institute for Government (IfG) think-tank.

In just a year-and-a-half some 54,000 staff have been cut from the civil service, more than was achieved over four years under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.

Last year the efficiency programme saved more than £5billion, and with savings of £8billion expected this year rising to £20billion by 2015.

The report warned that coalition government could lead to ‘fragile leadership’, while any decline in staff engagement could make further change ‘extremely difficult’.

‘The experience so far has been draining for staff at all levels, it warned.Motivating staff will be ‘tough’ with many ‘seeing a bleaker future’ than when they joined the civil service.

The IfG said departments would struggle to make further cuts without ‘radical new thinking’ about the way Whitehall works.

Too little has been done about how ‘how change makes staff feel’ rather than just imposing ‘logical’ cuts, one official told researchers.

‘Whitehall is at a turning point; the rapid pace of change to date belies a deeper fragility and challenges ahead,’ said the report, entitled Transforming Whitehall.

‘Two out of three large change programmes fail to achieve their aims in the private sector and there are reasons to think Whitehall may fare worse.

‘Most departments have struggled to find the capacity and capability required to lead departmental reorganisation on top of ministerial and other priorities.’

The report recommended giving more responsibility to officials below the highest ranks, in order to keep reform programmes on track in the case of changes at the top.

Report author James Page, said: ‘Our 
study shows 17 departments have approached their cuts in 17 different 
ways; some with greater success than others. They are only part-way 
through and, with more cuts on the horizon, the stakes are high.

‘It's
important to take stock of what works and the major risks ahead. 
Departments need to find effective ways of planning for the difficult 
choices and trade-offs they will face, beyond just immediate priorities.

‘It
is essential that leaders throughout Whitehall work together more 
effectively across departmental boundaries to find the best options for 
savings and new ways of working.

‘And,
with the danger of declining staff engagement, the onus is on leaders 
to ensure the motivation and capability is there to see them through.’

Departments
should find ways to work together to deliver savings, if it proves 
impossible to make more cuts solely within their own budgets.

Major changes in Whitehall are being overseen by Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude and head of the civil service Sir Bob Kerslake

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘In May 2010, this Government inherited the biggest budget deficit in the developed world. To ensure Britain can be in the future what it has been in the past, we are acting and taking difficult decisions.

‘That's why we set up the Efficiency and Reform Group which is driving massive savings from departments and fundamentally changing the way Whitehall operates to improve efficiency through reforms and spending controls.

‘Savings of this magnitude cannot come by trimming budgets. That's why we are working to transform Whitehall into a leaner, more efficient machine that manages its finances like the best-run businesses.’
