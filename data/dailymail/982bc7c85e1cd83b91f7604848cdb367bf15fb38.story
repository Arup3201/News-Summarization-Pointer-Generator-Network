Arsenal begin their whistlestop tour of New York today when they touch down in the Big Apple.

The Gunners will cram plenty during their four day stay: daily training sessions, fan parties, coaching clinics and Saturday’s clash against Thierry Henry’s New York Red Bulls on Saturday. 

For the club, it’s a chance to plant commercial roots in a country they are yet to crack on a big scale.

But for the players, it’ll be an opportunity to plant their own seeds - in manager Arsene Wenger’s head - ahead of the new season.

Of course, for some, the need to make an impression on the Gunners boss will be greater than others.

Aaron Ramsey, for example, knows he’ll have an integral role in Arsenal’s trophy charge next season having established himself as the club’s premier central midfielder.

Likewise, Kieran Gibbs knows he’s almost certain to start the season as the club’s first-choice left-back having seen off the challenge of Nacho Monreal.

However, others aren’t so fortunate.

And here, Sportsmail takes a look at the Gunners’ travelling party who’ll want to make it BIG in New York.Wojciech Szczesny Almost certain to start the season as the club’s No 1. But the imminent arrival of David Ospina from Nice will raise further question marks over the Pole’s position as first-choice goalkeeper. Ospina impressed for Colombia during the World Cup and will arrive in north London intent on dislodging Szczesny between the posts. It’s not the first time Szczesny’s role has come under scrutiny during his time at Arsenal, but a strong pre-season will help reinforce his position as the club’s undisputed first-choice keeper.Carl Jenkinson The right-back may have thought his time had come when Bacary Sagna left for Manchester City earlier this summer, but the arrival of Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle means Jenkinson will play second-fiddle again. But it could get worse for the youngster, with Wenger known to be in the market for another right-back. They have held talks over a move for Atletico Madrid’s Javier Manquillo and have been linked with Catania right-back Gino Peruzzi. A strong showing in America could be enough to persuade Wenger that Jenkinson can fill the role as reserve right-back.

Nacho Monreal Was signed by Arsenal in January 2013 as the man to replace injury-prone Kieran Gibbs as the club’s first-choice left-back. However, the move has not gone as planned for the Spaniard. Gibbs’ form has been first-class since Monreal’s arrival, while those niggling injuries that have blighted his career seem to have cleared up. Monreal expressed his concern at his lack of playing time to Wenger last season and won’t want another year of warming the bench. Can he breathe life into his Gunners career here in America? Mikel Arteta It’s contract time for the former Everton man. He has less than 12 months on his existing Arsenal deal leaving his future at the club uncertain. He wants to stay at the Emirates Stadium and says he will talk to Wenger in the coming weeks to clarify his future. Talk of the club signing a new holding central midfielder will not have gone unnoticed by the Spaniard. Some strong performances in pre-season, starting against the New York Red Bulls on Saturday, could go a long way to securing his place in the starting XI…and a new contract.

Mathieu Flamini Like Arteta, knows his place in the Arsenal’s team is under threat given the club’s pursuit of a new central midfielder. Having started the season well, his performances tailed off towards the end of the season. It is likely to be Ramsey and one other to start in central midfield next season. Flamini, by nature, is more suited to a defensive game than Arteta, though the Spaniard is a much better passer - a trait Wenger prefers. A good summer campaign from Flamini and Arteta could be enough to convince Wenger he already has enough in central midfield going into the new season.Jack Wilshere It’s not been the most memorable few months for the midfielder. He missed the majority of the final few weeks of last season with a foot injury, before playing a peripheral role in England’s disastrous World Cup campaign. And as if things couldn’t get any worse, the spotlight was back on the the 22-year-old again last week after he was photographed smoking and behaving outrageously during a summer break in Las Vegas. Wilshere is at a crossroads, he knows it and so do the Arsenal coaching team. Competition in central midfield is fierce, but Wilshere certainly has the ability to play alongside Ramsey. Playing and training well here in America will certainly help his cause.

Abou Diaby Arsenal’s forgotten man. The Gunners need for a bona-fide world class holding midfielder is clear - but in Diaby they may already have one. As always, the biggest obstacle towards the Frenchman playing a key role for Arsenal next season will be his fitness. Can he stay clear of injury long enough to have a sustained run in the team? If so, then Wenger may not need to splash the cash on signing Sami Khedira, Lars Bender or Morgan Schneiderlin.
