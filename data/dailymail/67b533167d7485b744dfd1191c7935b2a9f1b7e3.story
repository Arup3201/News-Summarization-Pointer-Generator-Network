Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has rejoined with his teammates in training, just days after the funeral of his 'little brother' Phillip Hughes.

Clarke looks set to play in the upcoming four-Test series against India, joining the team as they started their preparations on Friday night and running laps at Adelaide Oval on Saturday morning.

Tuesday marks not only the opening day of the series, but the first time Hughes' team mates will play after their beloved friend was felled at the Sydney Cricket Ground, on day one of a Sheffield Shield round between South Australia and New South Wales.

Clarke told mourners during his emotional eulogy at Hughes' funeral, 'we must play on', advice that the captain seems to have taken to heart and encouraged his team with.

Brad Haddin, Australian Test wicket keeper, said that Clarke seemed confident and looked to be committed to playing in Tuesday's match.

'Michael had a good hit today, he's going to back up this afternoon and be involved in our session,'[ Haddin told The ABC.

'I haven't thought about it (captaining Australia in the absence of Clarke) to be honest,' he said.

'All signs are that he is going in the right direction and we're like everyone else, we want Michael out there.'

Sean Abbott will sit out this weekend's round of club fixtures as Sydney club cricket returns for the first time since Phillip Hughes' death.

The 22-year-old bowler plays for Sydney University in grade cricket but will miss the next set of fixtures along with his New South Wales team-mate Mitchell Starc.  

Abbott bowled the bouncer to Hughes at the Sydney Cricket Ground during a Sheffield Shield game that proved fatal.

He attended the funeral of Hughes in Macksville on Wednesday having returned to training with New South Wales the day before.

According to his state side, Abbott alone will decide whether he wants to return to first class cricket at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday.

Abbott has drawn sympathy from the global cricketing community, though former players and pundits have cast doubts on his ability to play at the highest level again.

New South Wales chief executive Andrew Jones said it would be Abbott's call if he wanted to play against Queensland, as it would be for the team mates who witnessed batsman Hughes' sickening injury.

The full impact of Hughes' shock death, after he was fatally struck by a bouncer, on not only the Australian cricket team but also on the game is yet to be seen. 

On Friday, the team banded together for training as they hit the nets, and there was laughter, can-can lines and even the odd bouncer.  

Australia coach Darren Lehmann reaffirmed that players will be given time to decide whether they're mentally up to playing at Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.

But the early signs suggest the fear of mass withdrawals was unfounded.  

The Australian cricket coach, affectionately known as 'Boof', is confident that the boys are back in business.

'I reckon you'll get a pretty good indication of how they're going today,' Lehmann said prior to training.

'(The squad is) getting on with what we do well and that's play cricket.'

The Australian cricketers showed incredible good humour, partaking in routine hijinks and questionable dance moves as players warmed up at a suburban oval on the fringes of the Adelaide CBD.

Kick-ups came first, with the standard debate over who was at fault when the soccer ball hit the ground.

It was only days earlier that the nation watched a clip at Phillip Hughes' funeral, broadcast on national television, which showed archive footage of the talented youngster playing the very same game alongside his team mates. 

Fielding drills were next, the four fast bowlers breaking away to one group.

They laughed with Peter Siddle when the Victorian overshot the mark with his return, the ball skidding along the car park and bumping a vehicle.

Then came the serious business.

David Warner was among the first batsmen to shuffle into the nets.

Siddle, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Johnson looked to regain rhythm in a centre-wicket session.

Even then, spirits remained remarkably high.

Chief selector Rod Marsh helped set the tone.

Marsh grabbed a baseball mitt and reprised his wicketkeeping days for a short time before being replaced by fielding coach Greg Blewett.

Both Marsh and Blewett understandably struggled to read the pacemen's deliveries.

The bouncer slowly came into fashion, although Johnson bowled a fuller length for most of the session.

Phillip Hughes shock death was caused by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG, which caused 'catastrophic' injuries when he was struck in the head on November 25

The players were photographed playing 'kick-ups'. At his Wednesday funeral, Phillip Hughes was shown in archive footage playing the same game as he laughed with his team mates

Hazlewood fired one in that flew over Shaun Marsh's head, but it was Siddle that truly stepped up.

He sent down a terrific short ball, Marsh quickly ducking under.

Chris Rogers was not so lucky, a rising delivery from Siddle inflicting some serious pain when it thumped his body.

It was remarkably normal.

Five days of Test cricket is obviously a significantly different proposition to a run in the park.
