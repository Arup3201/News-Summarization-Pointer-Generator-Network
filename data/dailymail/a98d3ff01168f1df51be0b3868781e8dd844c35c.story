The bodybuilding ex-boyfriend of a woman stabbed to death told friends and a mistress he would kill his former partner so 'no one else' could have her, an inquest heard.

Tragic Gabrielle Stanley, 28, was brutally knifed at the Doncaster, South Yorkshire, home she had shared with steroid user Simon Hall, 36, on October 26 last year.

She sustained 30 stab wounds in the attack and died at Doncaster Royal Infirmary later that night.

Hall was also found dead at the scene and a post-mortem revealed the cause of death to be hanging.

An inquest at Doncaster Crown Court heard today that six weeks before Gabrielle was stabbed she had split up with Hall because of his infidelity and his continued steroid abuse.

Despite giving Gabrielle space to begin with, Hall started to obsessively try and win Gabrielle back and even threatened suicide to get her round to his house, the inquest heard.

Numerous friends and Katie Wath, with whom Hall had been having an affair with, noticed his behaviour change in the weeks leading up to the pair’s death.

A statement from Miss Wath told the inquest: 'Simon was a very jealous man. He told me [after the split] "no one else can have Gabs, I’m going to kill Gabs".'

Hall was also found dead at the scene and a post-mortem revealed the cause of death to be hanging

A statement from John Hall, one of the bodybuilder's close friends, recalled a conversation the two men had in the weeks before the deaths: 'He told me he was following Gabrielle on
 his push bike. He didn’t really elaborate but said he’s been following 
her.

'He was asking why she had left him over and over again.

'Simon said he couldn’t handle the thought of Gabrielle going out with anyone else. He said to me "if I find out she is seeing someone else I will kill her then I will kill them".'

The inquest heard Hall had been going out with Gabrielle for 10 years and lived with him Doncaster for three years.

Police were called to a 'disturbance' at the property, where they found Ms Stanley with multiple stab injuries

On the night of the deaths Gabrielle had been
 to visit Hall to discuss the possibility of buying his share of the 
mortgage and keeping the house they had shared together.

Despite
 the meeting being a strictly business occasion, the inquest heard that 
Simon was very happy about Gabrielle coming over and had prepared a 
meal, got some alcohol and had a DVD for the pair to watch.

But at approximately 10pm, neighbours on the street where the pair had lived recalled hearing a woman screaming for help.

Neighbour Daniel Cutts said: 'I had the window open because it was a humid night and heard a female screaming ‘"help me help me help me" as I went to look out the window there was a female lying on the street.

'I waited and a male came out of the house and dragged the female back into the house her body was limp and her feet were dragging along the floor.

'I shouted "Gabby, is that you Gabby?" and the man came out and said she had had too much to drink.'

As Daniel worked with Gabrielle’s mother, Deborah, he made contact with the family and told them to get round fast as something had happened.

A statement from a witness who saw the attack happening in the house between 10pm and 10.45pm - but who cannot be named for legal reasons - was read out in court.

It said: 'She heard what is described as a high pitched scream. She heard the words "stop it, please don’t" and saw the woman curled up on the floor, laid on her side with her back against the wall.

'She saw a man walk up and then crouch over her before he started to punch and hit her.'

Emergency services were called by neighbours on the street, who attended the address minutes later and discovered Hall dead and Gabrielle with severe stab wounds and covered in blood.

Recording a verdict of unlawful killing for Gabrielle Stanley at Doncaster Crown Court, Coroner Nicola Mundy said: 'Gabrielle Stanley had been in a long-term relationship with [Hall] and had resided with him until six weeks before her death when she chose to end the relationship.

'Their relationship had been difficult for a long time due to [Hall's] relationships with other women, the fact that he spent a considerable time in the gym and used steroids, which affected his behaviour and made him aggressive.'

Ms Mundy said that she was certain that Gabrielle had no intention of reconciling her relationship with Hall when she went over to the house they formerly shared to discuss finances.

However, the inquest heard that Hall was 'obsessive' in his attempts to win Gabrielle back and was sure that she would return to him one day.

Ms Mundy added: 'I consider that at some point in the evening her partner had seen the phone and realised Gabrielle was in another relationship and his hopes of reconciliation would come to nothing and that led him to carry out a severe and sustained attack on Gabrielle.'Ms Mundy recorded a verdict of suicide for Simon Hall.
