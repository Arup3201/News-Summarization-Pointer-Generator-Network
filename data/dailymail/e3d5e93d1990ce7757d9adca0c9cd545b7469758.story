It was the highest jackpot for almost a year at $380 million.

But once again, the Powerball has slipped through the fingers of the millions who played and prayed.

Not one ticket bore the winning numbers 5, 10, 21, 34, 58 and the Powerball: 33. 

It means there will be a 19th consecutive rollover for the next drawing on Wednesday - driving the figure up to approximately $450 million. 

Unlucky: Nobody landed the winning ticket to take home $350 million in last night's Powerball jackpot

The overall odds of winning a prize in the game are approximately 1 in 32. 

The chance of winning a Powerball jackpot is one in 175,223,510. That has not happened since December 3, 2014.

Regardless, people braced blisteringly cold weather across the country to lay their claim. 

Vendors credited 'brisk' ticket sales this week for the significantly increased jackpot, which jumped up $32 million since last Saturday's draw.

Sue Dooley, the senior drawing manager for the Multi-State Lottery Association, estimated value of Wednesday's drawing will be $450 million. 

Hopeful: Vendors attributed 'brisk' ticket sales to the surge in value of the jackpot, which will now hit $450m

The huge jackpot is a return to form for Powerball, which has been known for its record-breaking jackpots in recent years.

But the Powerball lottery has experienced a slump, with nearly a year passing since its jackpot total climbed above $300 million.

Powerball's last major jackpot was in February 2014, when it climbed to $425 million.

The jackpot - won by matching all five white balls in any order and the red Powerball - is either an annuitized prize paid out over 29 years or a lump sum payment.

On Saturday, the one-time lump sum payment would have been $220.6 million.

The second prize - won by matching five white balls in any order - is $1,000,000 paid in cash and any time a player matches the red Powerball, they win. 

Powerball tickets cost $2 each.
