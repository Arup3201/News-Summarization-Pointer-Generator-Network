A 36-year-old woman has been charged with drink-driving an SUV owned by Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford.

The mayor's black Cadillac Escalada was impounded for seven days following the alleged impaired driving incident on Tuesday.

The woman charged with drink-driving has been identified as Lee Anne McRobb, who is understood to have been staying in the same rehab facility as the mayor, the Toronto Sun has reported.

Sources told the paper she had been in the GreeneStone Muskoka treatment centre.

She refused to tell reporters at Northland Towing and Recovery, in Gravenhurst, on Wednesday why she was driving the mayor's car.

In one of two videos posted to YouTube by MooseFM's Carly Verhoeven, McRobb appears to say that she had spent time in the facility.

When asked why she was driving the car she said: 'It doesn't matter. That's for me to know. You guys don't need to know.'

Police confirmed yesterday that McRobb had permission to use the vehicle from its registered owner, CBCNews Toronto has reported.

Police would not comment on the identity of the vehicle's owner.

Rooms at GreeneStone have fireplaces, Jacuzzi tubs, balconies, patios and views of either woodlands or the Sunset Bay on Lake Muskoka

McRobb is due to appear in court in Bracebridge on June 17.

Ford's lawyer confirmed last week that he is still undergoing treatment for his addiction problems, though he would not confirm where he was being treated.

Ford's lawyer Dennis Morris told the Toronto Sun he had not heard of McRobb before.

Ford has taken a leave of absence and paused his re-election campaign since last month in a bid to treat his alcoholism.

His step away from the mayor's office followed the emergence of a new video allegedly showing him smoking crack.

The controversial mayor issued a statement saying that he had decided to 'seek immediate help' and was '100 per cent committed to getting myself right'.

Later that week, Doug Ford, the brother and campaign manager of Ford, made an impassioned plea on his behalf.

Choking back tears, Doug Ford said at a press conference: 'Iâ€™ll continue to stand by my brother and his family throughout this difficult journey.'

The mayor first grabbed international attention last year when a group tried selling another video showing the mayor smoking crack.

While that video was never released to the public, Toronto Police say they have a copy of it and Mayor Ford eventually copped to smoking the substance in a 'drunken stupor'.
