Forget designer handbags, a well-groomed dog, clad in the hottest canine fashions - customised coats, fashion collars and even doggy sunglasses are presently proving popular - is the latest trend rocking the UK.

New research released today reveals that dogs are no longer seen as just man’s best friend, but also as a fashionable accessory, perhaps inspired by the four-legged stars of hit TV shows such as Made in Chelsea.

Nearly one in 10 (8 per cent) Britons chose their dog because they deemed it a 'fashionable purchase', while a further one in 14 (7 per cent) dog owners admitted that their favourite celebrity inspired them to purchase their pet.

And with E4’s popular series returning to our screens this Monday 7 April, dog owners up and down the country are getting ready to watch the doggy companions of the reality stars, who are becoming personalities in their own right.

The show’s popular dog owners include Lucy Watson, who has a German Spitz called Digby and Binky Felstead who has a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Scrumble.

Cheska Hull’s beloved canine companion is a Pomeranian called ‘Evie’ and she also has a Yorkshire Terrier called ‘Nellie’. Rosie Fortescue has a Dachshund called ‘Noodle’, while former cast member Millie Mackintosh has a French Bulldog called ‘Herby'.

Nearly half of UK dog owners admit to owning breeds of dogs that feature in the show such as Binky's King Charles Spaniel 'Scrumble'

Made In Chelsea star Francesca or 'Cheska', who is obviously one of the 17 per cent who have bought their dog a customised coat, regularly updates her followers on her pooch Evie

Cheska posts regular snaps on Twitter of Evie, her fluffy Pomeranian, who even has her own Twitter profile, with over 1,700 followers.

Lucy Watson also updates Twitter on the antics of her German Spitz, Digby; as do Binky and Rosie, along with a few carefully-filtered Instagram pictures.

Cost seems no object when it comes to buying the ideal dog: a third of UK dog owners say they shelled out between £251- £1,000 for their pet.

On average, UK dog owners spend £70 a month feeding their dogs.

However, this is only slightly more than how much they spend on grooming and buying accessories for their dogs, which is on average £57 a month.

As well as paying for grooming, many owners buying their dogs expensive accessories.

Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of owners have bought their dog a fashion collar.

More than one in six (17 per cent) have bought their dog a customised coat, while 7 per cent have bought them shoes and 4 per cent have gone as far to buy them sunglasses for strolls in the park on those bright days.

And it’s anything but a dog’s life for these pampered pooches, with a further 3 per cent purchasing doggy jewellery for their pets.

Shockingly, 2 per cent of dog owners have even admitted to putting their dog in a pram.

With E4's popular series returning to our screens this Monday 7 April, dog owners up and down the country are getting ready to watch the doggy companions of the reality stars

Sammy-Lea Samways, head of pet insurance at Confused.com, who conducted the research, says: 'Over the past few years the popularity of reality TV programmes such as Made in Chelsea has grown, which seems to have fuelled the desire for ‘designer dogs’ similar to those which feature in shows such as these.

'Purchasing a fashionable breed of dog to keep up with this celebrity trend could set people back as much as £1,1585, and this doesn’t account for extra costs such as grooming or fashion accessories that some dog owners seem to love.

'When thinking about how expensive these dogs can be, and with ongoing reports of dog theft, we want to make sure owners have adequate pet insurance in place.'
