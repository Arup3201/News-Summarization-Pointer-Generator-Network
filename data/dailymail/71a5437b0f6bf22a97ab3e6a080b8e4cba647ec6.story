Former PM Tony Blair was given an award for his 'global legacy' by Save the Children last year

Save the Children has apologised over its decision to give Tony Blair an award for his 'global legacy' after a furious public backlash.

Justin Forsyth, the charity's chief executive, said he was 'very sorry' for those upset by the decision, but insisted it was only meant to mark his work in Africa and not his entire time in Number 10.

Mr Forsyth, a former Downing Street aide, admitted it would have been 'wrong' to give an award to the former PM for his political legacy rather than for his work on international aid.

Mr Blair was handed an award for spending billions of taxpayers' money on foreign aid at a star-studded ceremony in New York last year.

The former PM, who set Britain on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas aid, was given the charity's Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership in international development.

But the award sparked widespread fury when it was announced in November.

More than 100,000 people signed an online petition calling for the award to be rescinded and around 500 Saved the Children staff members have reportedly backed a similar petition.

Questioned about the award on the BBC's Today programme this morning, Mr Forsyth said: 'I know that many of our supporters and volunteers were very upset and our staff, several of our staff too, and I'm very sorry for that.'

He said the decision had been made by the British charity's 'sister organisation' in the US and insisted the award was only for his Africa work.

Mr Forsyth said: 'Yes, it was a global legacy award. It was called that. But actually it was an award very, very specifically for Tony Blair's efforts on Africa at two G8 summits at Birmingham and Gleneagles, not his wider legacy.

'And if it had been for his wider legacy I think it would be wrong, but it was for something quite specific that helped Africa and children.

'I'm sorry it's upset so many people. It's not really what we do at Save the Children. What we're really doing is on the ground in Syria with the Ebola treatment centre in Sierra Leone – that's the work we do.

'This has been really an unnecessary distraction. I do apologise to those people that it's upset.'

Mr Forsyth admitted the row had 'in part' damaged the charity in eyes of some staff but expressed hope people would accept organisations 'make mistakes'.

Mr Forsyth was recruited to Number 10 by Mr Blair to help with work on poverty and climate change. He then became one of Gordon Brown's senior advisers before joining Save the Children.

As prime minister, Mr Blair set up the Department for International Development and hosted a series of aid summits.

Critics say Britain's foreign aid budget – which hit £11.4billion last year – has led to a string of perverse outcomes, including spending millions in countries such as India which can afford its own space programme.

Accepting his award last year, Mr Blair said: 'From the beginning of humankind there has been brutality, conflict, intrigue, the destructive obsession with a narrow self-interest.

'But throughout all human history, never has been extinguished that relentless, unquenchable desire to do good. To act not only in self-interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it.'

At the time, a spokesman for Save The Children said: 'The UK's achievement of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international aid in 2014 is the culmination of work started under [Mr Blair's] leadership.'
