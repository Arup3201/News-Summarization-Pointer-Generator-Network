Smithsonian magazine has used an algorithm based on data taken from Wikipedia pages to compile a list of the 100 most influential Americas of all time.

Alongside presidents, entrepreneurs and athletes, the group also includes presidential assassins, professional wrestlers, notorious gangsters and serial killers.

Surprise names featuring on the list being published in a collector's edition of the magazine include mobsters John Dillinger and Al Capone, cult leader and murderer Charles Manson, movie star-turned-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger and race horse Secretariat.

Smithsonian magazine compiled a list of the 100 most influential Americans using an algorithm which took data from Wikipedia pages. The list included President Abraham Lincoln and Muhammad Ali

L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology, Lee Harvey Oswald, the man suspected of killing JFK and professional wrestler Hulk Hogan also make appearances.  

Some of the less unexpected appearances are made by Abraham Lincoln, Muhammad Ali, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr. and Bill Gates. 

The group is not ranked, but is split into ten groups the magazine believed are significant.

They are: Trailblazers, Rebels & resisters, Presidents, First Women, Outlaws, Artists, Religious figures, Pop icons, Empire-builders, Athletes.

Steven Skiena, a professor of computer science at Stony Brook University, and Charles B. Ward, an engineer at Google, came up with an algorithm that ranks historical figures. 

It is based on not just what an individual has done, but also how well they are remembered for it. 

By using Wikipedia, which has 840,000 pages dedicated to individuals throughout history, they  produce a single score for each person.

Criminals: Two surprising additions were serial killer Charles Manson and the man accused of assassinating JFK, Lee Harvey Oswald 

The formula incorporates the number of links to each page, the number of page views, the length of the entries and how often they are edited.

Their algorithms differentiate between two kinds of historical reputation, what they call 'gravitas' and 'celebrity.'

By their reckoning, Jesus, Napoleon, Muhammad, William Shakespeare and Abraham Lincoln rank as the top five figures in world history. 

According to the pair however, their method does have limitations. Wikipedia for example favors Americans over foreigners, English speakers over others, men over women and white people over other races. 

Mobsters: John Dillinger (left) and Al Capone (right), who thrived in the trade of illegal liquor during prohibition era, both made it onto the list 

The list will be released as a collectors edition of the magazine which published its first edition in 1970
