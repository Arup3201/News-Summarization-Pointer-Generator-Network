A photo has revealed the full extent of Stephen Ireland's injury, which left the midfielder needing '12-13 stitches' after Maynor Figueroa's horror challenge left a three inch gash in his calf.

The Stoke City player was taken off at half time and the prognosis of the nasty injury is likely to keep him out of action for a minimum of three weeks. 

Figueroa is unlikely to receive a ban with any potential retrospective action hinging on referee Neil Swarbrick and his officials' prognosis of who saw the challenge. It is understood at least one of them did witness the incident.

The incident left his manager Mark Hughes furious after the game who insisted the Honduras international could have ended Ireland's career. 

He said: ‘Stephen Ireland has been on the end of a horrendous tackle, one that should’ve seen a straight red.

'The tackle could've finished his career. Why the referee hasn't given a straight red I've no idea.

Figueroa cleared the ball and followed through to rake his studs down Ireland's leg

He is likely to escape any action from the FA because the officials have confirmed they saw the incident

Ireland is now expected to miss the next three weeks of the season following his nasty injury

'Ireland’s come in at half-time and rolled his sock down, there’s a wound needing 12-13 stitches. I’ve watched the video back, it’s shocking. We’re frustrated. They need to do better.' 

The Britannia Stadium is no stranger to horror injuries, when Aaron Ramsey's leg was broken following a Ryan Shawcross tackle in 2010.

Despite the shocking injury to Ireland, the Potters scored a late winner through Peter Crouch to help soften the news of his expected absence.
