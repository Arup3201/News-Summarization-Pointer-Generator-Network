A Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate was advised 'not to be associated' with party leader Nick Clegg - and was warned to dodge a visit to his constituency by the Deputy Prime Minister last week.

Maajid Nawaz, the Lib Dem candidate for Hampstead and Kilburn  was told that being seen with Mr Clegg would 'blunt the progress we are making' in the constituency.

The email from Lib Dem campaigner James Newsome, who stood for the Lib Dems as a local councillor for Camden Council this year but failed to get elected, advised the prospective MP to 'let Nick do his own thing'.

Liberal Democrat candidates have been advised not to be pictured with the leader Nick Clegg

The remarks from Mr Newsome, a city banker who has worked at Mr Nazaw's press officer, were made in an email he accidentally sent to his local paper, the Ham & High.

In the email he raised concerns about a visit by the Deputy PM to the Tavistock Centre, an NHS-run mental health centre, which Mr Nawaz was also invited to last Friday.

In the email from Mr Newsome to Mr Nawaz, he stated: 'M, I am on same page as I was when this visit first came up. We don't need to be there.

'In fact you being associated with the leadership right now blunts the progress we are making with these young volunteers and the crossover pledge momentum we are getting.'

He added: 'You are a top 500 Briton in Debretts Guv, let's let Nick do his own thing, which is good in itself, right? J.'

Mr Nawaz, 37, is a former member of the radical Islamist organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir - who was jailed for four years in Egypt in his mid-20s before being released and setting up anti-extremism think-tank Quilliam.

He was recently named in Debrett's 500, a list of the UK's top 500 most influential people.

Mr Nawaz, however, did not follow the advice from Mr Newsome and attended the visit with his party leader last Friday.

Local Benjamin Tailor, 43, said: 'Maajid is doing good things around here and people like and respect him.

'He needs to follow his own path, but he also needs to stick by his leader - whether or not he is good for his image or not.'

Another local, who asked not to be named, however, said Mr Nawaz should 'stay away from toxic Clegg', adding: 'Nick Clegg has abandoned all that I thought the Lib Dems stood for since going into coalition with the Tories.

'He has backtracked and U-turned so many times it's a wonder he knows which direction he is facing - he is toxic and can only hurt Maajid's chances of being elected.'

A Lib Dem spokesman, asked to comment on the email, said this week: 'Maajid joined Nick on his visit to the Tavistock, he has been at Nick's side in the past and will be in the future as he fights to win Hampstead and Kilburn.'
