Fans of fantasy fiction might imagine it was Gollum’s greed and obsession, or Dracula’s thirst for blood that lead the villains to come to a sticky end.

But the consistent triumph of good over evil in fantasy literature may be linked to unsavoury characters’ aversion to sunlight, a scientist has said.

The British researcher theorised that baddies who dwell in the darkness and eat a poor diet are left lacking in vitamin D, leading to muscle weakness, which critically undermines their performance in battle.

British researchers think baddies who dwell in the darkness, such as Gollum (pictured from The Hobbit film) eat a poor diet are left lacking in vitamin D, leading to muscle weakness, which critically undermines their performance in battle

However, good characters are often bathed in sunlight which makes them strong, according to a light-hearted study by Imperial College London.

No previous studies have investigated vitamin D levels in imaginary populations, so to test the hypothesis, researchers scoured J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, The Hobbit for references to characters' living conditions, habits and diet.

They used these clues to give each character a score, rating their likely vitamin D levels.

Vitamin D is produced in the skin when it is exposed to sunlight and can also be obtained from some foods such as oily fish, egg yolks and cheese.

The Hobbit's hero, Bilbo Baggins, lives in a hole, but it has windows, and he is known to enjoy sitting in the sun overlooking his garden.

The hobbit diet is clearly varied, as Bilbo is able to offer cake, tea, seed cake, ale, porter, red wine, raspberry jam, mince pies, cheese, pork pie, salad, cold chicken, pickles and apple tart to the dwarves who visit to engage him on the business of burglary.

In contrast, villains such as Gollum, the goblins and Smaug the dragon spend most of their time in darkness and do not whip up feasts for visitors, instead preferring to dine on decaying corpses and scraps of meat.

The good characters, who all emerge victorious, have significantly higher vitamin D scores than the bad characters, who are defeated, Dr Nicholas Hopkinson of Imperial College London and his son Joseph noted, in the Christmas edition of the Medical Journal of Australia.

‘Systematic textual analysis of The Hobbit supports our initial hypothesis that the triumph of good over evil may be assisted to some extent by the poor diet and lack of sunlight experienced by the evil characters,’ he said.

The pair acknowledged that their study had several limitations.

‘We have not discriminated between creatures that can be considered, broadly speaking, to be mammalian and those that are not and whose physiology is more obscure.

‘Unfortunately, the principal purpose of the author of The Hobbit was not to provide a systematic dietary history, so reporting bias is a possibility.

‘In particular, there is an emphasis in the text on meat items similar to Homer's Odyssey, where feasting is a recurrent motif but where few references to salad are made.’

They said that more research would be needed to establish whether their study is representative of Tolkien’s other novels and of fantasy literature in general.
