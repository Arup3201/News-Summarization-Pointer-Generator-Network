Pop duo Hall and Oates are suing a cereal company over the name of its maple syrup and oat granola.

The two musicians have accused the Brooklyn-based firm of infringing on their trademark with the packet of cereal - called Haulin' Oats.

Early Bird Foods & Co, who make the cereal, deliberately created a phonetic play on the band's well-known name, the duo claim.

The lawsuit suggests the company must hand over any profits made from the granola  as it has traded off the band's 'fame and notoriety'.

It adds that others have previously tried 'to make a connection between the artists' names and oats-related products'.

The cereal - which costs $27 for three packets - is described as 'wholesome old-fashioned goodness' on the company's website. 

It is sold in 38 states, as well as Europe and Japan.  

Nekisia Davis, owner of Early Birds Food, said she had no comment. 

But in an apparent reference to one of the duo's 1983 hits she added: 'Except say it isn't so.'

Hall and Oates started working together in the early 1970s and have sold more albums than any other duo in music history.

Their 1972 debut album and corporate company are called Whole Oats. 

Hits include Maneater, Rich Girl, Private Eyes, I Can't Go for That (No Can Do), Sara Smile and She's Gone. 

The case was filed in Brooklyn federal court.
