Modern day inventor: N. Joseph Woodland, co-inventor with Bernard Silver of the bar code that labels nearly every product in stores today, died on Sunday at the age of 91

Scanned more than five million times a day, instantaneously encoding product data while boosting work production, it was with Norman Joseph Woodland's fingers in the sand that he first invented the revolutionizing bar code.

Mr Woodland, deemed co-inventor of the what was originally a circular emblem of lines that would later become responsible for nearly every product labeling in stores, died on Sunday at the age of 91.

Suffering the effect Alzheimer's disease and complications of his advanced age in his home in Edgewater, New Jersey, his daughter, Susan Woodland of New York, announced his death on Thursday.

As an undergraduate student at what's now called Drexel University in Philadelphia, it was after later co-inventor Bernard Silver  overheard a grocery-store executive's pleas to the engineering school's dean for students for help.

His request was an invention that would quickly capture product information at checkout that both were inspired, according to Susan Woodland.

Woodland notably had worked on the Manhattan Project, the U.S. military's atomic bomb development team.

After having already earned a mechanical engineering degree, Woodland dropped out of graduate school to work on the bar code idea. He stole away to spend time with his grandfather in Miami to focus on developing a code that could symbolically capture details about an item, Susan Woodland.

Modernized: IBM promoted a rectangular barcode to the inventors' circular version, leading to a standard for universal product code, or UPC, technology

The only code Woodland knew was the Morse Code he'd learned in the Boy Scouts, his daughter said. One day, he drew Morse dots and dashes as he sat on the beach and absent-mindedly left his fingers in the sand where they traced a series of parallel lines.

'It was a moment of inspiration. He said, 'instead of dots and dashes I can have thick and thin bars,'' Susan Woodland said.

Woodland and Silver submitted their patent in 1949 for a code patterned on concentric circles that looked like a bull's eye.

The patent was issued in 1952, 60 years ago this fall. Silver died in 1963.

Both eventually sold their patent for $15,000 to Philco, making the most they ever received from their patent.

Woodland joined IBM in 1951 hoping to develop the bar code, but the technology wasn't accepted for more than two decades until lasers made it possible to read the code readily, the technology company said.

In the early 1970s, Woodland moved to Raleigh to join a team at IBM's Research Triangle Park, N.C., facility.

About
10 years after the patent had expired, the team developed a 
bar-code-reading laser scanner system in response to demand from 
grocers' desires to automate and speed checkout while also cutting 
handling and inventory management costs.

Solution: Appealing to grocers' desires to speed up checkout, IBM developed a bar-code-reading laser scanner system, one right, capable of reading them at little expense modernizing the code into a universal symbol, seen tattooed left

Challenge: A QR Code, developed in Japan, is growing in competition to the original UPC code while this one can be scanned using cell phones

IBM promoted a rectangular barcode that led to a standard for universal product code technology.

The first product sold using a UPC scan was a 67-cent package of Wrigley's chewing gum at a supermarket in Troy, Ohio, in June 1974, according to GS1 US, the American affiliate of the global standard-setting UPC body.

Today, about 5 billion products are scanned and tracked worldwide every day.

Woodland was born Sept 6, 1921, in Atlantic City, N.J.

Woodland and Microsoft founder Bill Gates were among those honored at the White House in 1992 for their achievements to technology, four months after President George H.W. Bush appeared amazed at a demonstration of a grocery checkout machine.
