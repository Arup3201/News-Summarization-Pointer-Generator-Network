Michelle Tea says her wedding day last month was 'the best moment' of her life but there was one thing troubling her throughout; the dead five-month-old baby inside her tummy.

The author, 42, from San Francisco, who had been undergoing IVF treatment with her partner Dashiell Lippman for two years, found out her fetus' heart had stopped shortly before her big day.

In a candid first person piece for XOJane, she revealed that she was unable to book a medical abortion before her November 9 nuptials and was terrified of miscarrying 'all over' her bridal gown at the alter.

'I wanted this clot of cells taken out of me so I could go on with my life,' she recalled.

She and Ms Lippman opted for a 'two mom' approach, allowing them to share the biological role in parenthood.

To do this doctors mixed Ms Lippman's eggs in a lab dish with donor sperm and then implanted the embryo in Ms Tea's uterus.

The same-sex couple underwent the procedure in July, and doctors confirmed the two women were expecting a baby. However, five months later Ms Tea learned the undeveloped child had died.

Recounting the harrowing experience, she wrote: 'I didn’t have sentimental feelings about it; once I learned it didn’t have a heartbeat and had stopped developing weeks ago I’d ceased thinking of it as my future child who will grow up.

'[Instead, I] had begun regarding it as a strange, gelatinous bit of sea life that had washed up on the shores of my uterus. Get it out.'

At her wedding there were several guests who asked about her pregnancy because they hadn't received 'the text' announcing the news.

Indeed, Ms Tea wrote:' My friend Weezy hissed, “Are you pregnant?”

'Poor Weezy, nobody must have sent her the text! I actually didn’t mind telling her. I was, but I’m miscarrying right now. Her eyes grew wide.

“Oh, girl!” I know, I nodded.'

But Weezy wasn't the first make the mistake, and Ms Tea said she was constantly asked about her prominent baby bump - merely the result of a 'mass of cells' and 'months of constipation.'

Five days after her wedding she underwent an abortion.

She said the procedure was delayed partly because of her 'hectic schedule' and also because she discovered the clinic near her is only open two days a week.

'Once I learned it didn’t have a heartbeat and had stopped 
developing weeks ago I'd ceased thinking of it as my future child who 
will grow up'

'How in the world can that be enough to accommodate all the ladies in San Francisco that need abortions?' she exclaimed.

The entire visit from start to finish took around four hours. Ms Tea said there was lots of 'waiting around and the termination itself only took around five to ten minutes.

After being administered some 'Novocaine-like stuff ' to numb her cervix doctors explained that she might start feeling dizzy or nauseous or get a metallic taste in her mouth.

Recalling what happened next, she wrote: 'After a couple hours it was finally time for me to don my assless smock and climb onto the table.

'It was so awesome that Dashiell could stand beside me the whole time, holding my hand and looking into my eyes. Her face is my most favorite thing on the planet.'

While she was 'super doped up' doctors tried to distract her from what was going on with a 'steady stream of inane chatter.'

Ms Tea continued: 'The pressure to engage was sort of exhausting. I was so doped up I didn’t want to talk. If I made any sort of noise someone – or all of them – would quickly ask if I was in pain. No, no, no pain. But I could feel a terrible tugging deep inside, a yanking.'

She said she was glad when the procedure was over and she was free to go home.

The accomplished author, poet and literary arts organizer previously told MsFitMag.com that she first experienced 'some sort of biological alarm clock' when she was about 27 years old.

But at the time she wasn't 'intellectually interested' in having a child and also described herself as a 'dirt-poor alcoholic.'

After meeting Ms Lippman in her late thirties she felt ready to start a family.

She has been documenting her pregnancy journey as part of a regular column for XOJane since November 2011.
