Generous: David Cameron argued Britain has a 'moral obligation' to help the world's poorest

Just one in four people support Britain spending  billions of pounds on ­foreign aid every year.And more than 60 per cent believe the cash is wasted, according to a poll.

The finding is a major blow to David Cameron, who is committed to protecting international development from budget cuts.

It follows a spate of stories linking Britain's aid spending to corruption or waste.

Spending on development by the Coalition is set to rise to £11.3billion next year.

Only 6 per cent of people in the Ipsos-Mori poll strongly disagreed with the idea that foreign aid is wasted. A further 20 per cent tended to disagree with the statement.

Together the total of 26 per cent is little more than a quarter of the public. But 61 per cent said that development money is being wasted.

Despite the lack of support, Mr Cameron made a passionate defence of his target of spending 0.7 per cent of the UK's income on foreign aid.

The decision will require an increase of 30 per cent in 2013 from £8.65billion this year.

Mr Cameron acknowledged it was 'difficult' to persuade the public that increasing aid was the right thing to do at a time of cutbacks at home.

But he insisted that the rise was in Britain's wider interests, as well as being morally right.

He said: 'It can sometimes be a difficult argument, because we're having tough times here at home, we're having to make difficult decisions, but Britain is an incredibly generous country.'

In Whitehall, a senior source said there was growing alarm among officials about the ability of the Department for International Development (Dfid) to manage next year's aid budget increase.

There are fears the result will be a rise in waste and corruption. 'It's not so much the scale of the spending, but the pace it is being pushed through at,' the source said. 'There are real questions whether any department can safely handle such a rapid increase in spending.'

But Mr Cameron said Britain had a 'moral obligation' to assist the poorest parts of the world and that specific programmes, such as those directed at tackling disease or child malnutrition, had tangible benefits.

The Prime Minister added that it is in Britain's self-­interest to invest in nations such as Somalia 'to make sure countries don't break down and we don't suffer from problems of mass migration and pandemics, problems of climate change'.

Repeated instances: The Daily Mail has reported on aid being wasted or used doubtfully

However, Mr Cameron acknowledged that aid can involve 'difficult decisions' as he explained the recent decision to wind down the £280million a year aid programme to India.

The move followed public concern over the handout to a nation now wealthy enough to have its own space programme.

He said: 'There does come a time when you have to recognise a country like India is becoming a middle-income country.

'While I know there are still very many very poor people in India, increasingly, the Indian government is investing money in poverty alleviation itself.

'What we should be doing is offering expertise and help, rather than money.'

Self interest: The PM said without aid countries like Somalia could 'cause problems for us at home'

The Mail has reported on repeated instances of aid being wasted or used doubtfully, including £30million sent to China – the world's second-largest economy – to plant trees, and £10million marked to combat poverty in Uganda ending up in private bank accounts.

A further £270million set for Rwanda came under question  as criticism grew of President Paul Kagame. The payments are now suspended.

The Independent Commission on Aid Impact warned recently in a report that plans for a vast hike in aid to Pakistan – which is set to become the biggest recipient of British money – should be  'approached cautiously'.

'We note that Dfid has no track record of delivering programmes in Pakistan on the scale that is now contemplated,' the report warned.

Bobby Duffy of Ipsos-Mori said the strength of feeling revealed by the poll of 1,002 people showed politicians should be 'realistic about how far opinion can be shifted' on aid.
