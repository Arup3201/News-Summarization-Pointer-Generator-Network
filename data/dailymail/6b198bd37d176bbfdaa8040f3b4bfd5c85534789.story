Later came MaxMara, the restrained opposite of Cavalli, where minimalist good taste prevailed in the form of slick loosely tailored separates in black, palest dove grey and camel, broken by jolts of bright orange.

By contrast, at Fendi, where both Cara Delevingne and Georgia May Jagger took to the runway, Karl Lagerfeld's typically slim silhouette was lifted by delicate hues of crimson, pink and cream.

Loose waves of fabric and delicate ruffles heightened the effect, broken up by the odd shift dress beautifully tailored in cheeky high shine fabric.

Rounding off day two was Milan's much-copied grande dame, Miuccia Prada, whose S/S14 effort combined ladylike knee-length skirts with playful pop art prints and eye-catching jewelled embellishment.
