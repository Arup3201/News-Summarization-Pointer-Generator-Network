Stephen McLaughlin, 34, of Londonderry, Northern Ireland, has been charged with conspiring to facilitate illegal entry into the UK 

Two lorry drivers have been remanded in custody following the death of a suspected illegal immigrant found in a shipping container at Tilbury Docks.

Stephen McLaughlin, 34, of Limavady, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, and Timothy Murphy, 33 of Elmgrove, Londonderry, were both charged with conspiring to facilitate illegal entry into the UK.

The pair made a appearance at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court today, both speaking only to confirm their name, date of birth and personal details from the dock.

The court heard that between August 1 and 17, the pair conspired to 'clandestinely convey 35 Afghan nationals by sea in to an English port, which facilitated the commission of a breach of immigration law'.

Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, from Afghanistan, was found dead inside the container at the Essex port on August 16. 

Father-of-two Mr Kapoor was among a group of 35 immigrants, including 13 children, who were discovered on a freight ferry. 

They were rescued at about 6.30am last Saturday when staff heard screaming and banging coming from the 40ft container, labelled Hudig & Kersten, which had arrived on a P&O vessel from Zeebrugge, northern Belgium. 

The group is believed to have been part of a tiny Sikh minority in Afghanistan and fled after suffering persecution. 

After being freed, the survivors said that they feared they were 20 minutes from death and were drifting in and out of consciousness. 

They were treated in local hospitals following the incident and survived the ordeal.   

They are in the process of claiming asylum in the UK after travelling to Europe in a lorry before reportedly spending 18 hours in the cargo container en route to the UK. 

The ages of those in the container ranged from one to 72.

Essex Police said a post-mortem examination on Mr Kapoor had failed to establish the cause of his death and inquiries are continuing.

McLaughlin and Murphy will appear via video-link for a hearing at Basildon Crown Court at a date to be set during the week beginning November 17.

The pair were arrested after a group of 35 suspected illegal immigrants were found in this shipping container at Tilbury Docks, Essex, which was unloaded off a freight ferry that had arrived from Zeebrugge, Belgium 

The group, including 13 children, were discovered after dock workers heard 'screaming and banging' coming from inside the 40ft container, labelled Hudig & Kersten, last Saturday morning
