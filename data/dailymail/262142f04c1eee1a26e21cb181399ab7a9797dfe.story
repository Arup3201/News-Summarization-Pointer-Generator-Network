This weekend we saw three of the best penalty takers in the country in action. Yaya Toure and Rickie Lambert both scored at the Etihad and Steven Gerrard scored another two on Sunday to make it 10 in the league.

Toure has now scored six times from the spot in 2013-14 while Lambert  continued his phenomenal record. Since arriving at Southampton he has scored 34 out of 34 penalties. That is some achievement.

Composed: Always handy from 12 yards, Steven Gerrard now has 10 goals from the spot this term

Cool: Yaya Toure has six from the spot this season, and scored the opener against Southampton

I spoke to Toure last week and asked him about his own impressive record this season. He never used to be a set-piece specialist but now he is  scoring them for fun. He told me the most important thing for a penalty taker is to stay calm, and there are few calmer players from 12 yards than Yaya.

Michael Ballack was also in the Sky studio with me on Saturday and when I asked if the Germans practice penalties, he laughed and said: ‘What for? For you English it is all in your heads.’

He is spot on. There is no way you can recreate the atmosphere and exhaustion of an international game after 120 minutes.

Gerrard will be at the World Cup in great form from the spot and Lambert’s record might give him an edge for selection. Let’s hope they keep it up.

Precision: Rickie Lambert has scored 34 of his 34 penalties taken for Southampton

No luck: England have lost out in a penalty shoot-out in six of their last 10 major tournaments

Blues are flying

That was exactly the kind of Super Sunday Merseyside will have wanted.

Roberto Martinez has Everton playing exceptional football and he really has taken them to another level. I said last week that Brendan Rodgers is my  manager of the year, but Martinez is not far behind. His team swept past Arsenal with such pace that they reminded me of the Arsenal teams of old.

Arsene Wenger’s side have conceded 20 goals now away to the top four, which shows you where they are going wrong.

Double trouble: Romelu Lukaku and Steve Naismith scored Everton's opening two goals against Arsenal

That's good son: Fired up boss Martinez and the Chelsea front man share the moment

Wanting: Arsenal players wait for play to restart after the second goal in the 3-0 domination by Everton 

Super Skrtel

It was a good result for the red half of Merseyside, too. So much is said about Liverpool’s attacking players but I was really impressed by Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho against West Ham.

Skrtel in particular has been excellent this season. There were doubts that he may not feature much but he has been essential to their success.

He did a great job on Andy Carroll and he needs to do the same next week against Man City’s fearsome strike force.

Pleased as Puncheon

When Jason Puncheon missed a penalty against Tottenham in January, it was the kind of miss that would have affected a lot of players.

But, as our table shows, his performances since then have been the perfect response.

He scored twice on Saturday, including a magnificent curling effort. He’s been at many clubs throughout his career but he might just have found a home at Palace.

I wondered if he would be a Tony Pulis type of player, but he has been crucial in the past few weeks. He has a great left foot and is showing what he can do.

Palace were magnificent against Cardiff and in such a vital game, too. There was always a question over whether they could follow up the win over Chelsea but they put in a fine display and Puncheon was at the heart of it.

Norwich finally pull the trigger

It's a big call for Norwich to sack Chris Hughton, but chief executive David McNally has had his list of replacements ready for a while.

The club’s Under 18s coach Neil Adams has been put in charge but he has been thrown a grenade. These are his first five matches: Fulham (A), Liverpool (H), Man United (A), Chelsea (A), Arsenal (H).

The Fulham game will be vital. Four weeks ago Felix Magath’s side looked doomed but the weekend results have given them hope. The turmoil at Norwich could help them and their great escape might just be on.

Heading down? Norwich are on the edge of the relegation zone and have decided to sack Hughton

Remainder: Youth coach Adams has taken charge, but Norwich have not said if he is a permanent replacement

A shame for Jay

Though Lambert might be on his way to Brazil it was sad to see his Southampton team-mate Jay Rodriguez pick up what looks like a serious injury. He has had a fantastic season and though there was no guarantee he’d get picked for the World Cup, he would have been unlucky to miss out.

I missed a World Cup and European Championship through injury – it breaks your heart in two. He just has to remember the season he has had, take positives from that and get fit again. He is still young so I’m sure his chance will come.

Leicester back on the up

Congratulations to Leicester on their promotion. It’s been 10 years since they were in the top flight but Nigel Pearson has done a great job and they thoroughly deserve to be back there. I expect Burnley to follow them soon and then it will be a real battle for the final place in the play-offs.

38 - Felix Magath has been keen to make the most of his squad since taking charge of Fulham. The German made three changes to the team that lost to Everton, including a second debut for Mahamadou Diarra in his second spell at the club. Diarra became the 38th player to be used by Fulham this season, a record for the Premier League.

49 - David Moyes (below) continued to tinker with his United team. He made eight changes for the Newcastle match and has now used a unique starting XI in 49 games.

6 - Aleksandar Kolarov set up another goal on Saturday. The Serb (right) has made six assists this season, more than any other defender in the league.

1973 - Fulham grabbed a vital three points at Aston Villa but they had not won a league match at Villa Park since March 1973. That year they won 3-2 in the old Division Two.

0.62 - Cardiff are in trouble. Under Malky Mackay they averaged 0.9 points per game but with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (below) they average just 0.62.

2 - Mohamed Salah now has two goals in two games at Stamford Bridge. He has scored as many goals for Chelsea at the ground as he has against them – he also scored two for Basle in the Champions League.

6 - Prior to defeat against West Brom, Norwich were unbeaten in six games at Carrow Road, winning three and drawing three. But West Brom’s fourth league win in five games at the ground has plunged Norwich right back into the relegation battle.
