Victoria Beckham has been careful to set herself apart from the typical celebrity designer, and this morning it seemed that her efforts had paid off.

A front row that included Anna Wintour, Maria Sharapova, Anna Dello Russo, as well as proud husband, David, broke out into rapturous applause as she took her bow at the end.

Clearly delighted by the reaction, Mrs Beckham is seen holding her hands to her face in surprise, before returning backstage.

Stunned: A thrilled Victoria Beckham could not believe the rapturous applause as she took her bow at the end of her New York Fashion Week show this morning

Take a bow: The designer wore a black minidress from the collection with the same towering peeop-toe shoe-boots worn by her models

The latest in a string of 
critically-acclaimed collections, Mrs Beckham continued the sharp schoolgirl theme that has been filtering into her collections lately.

Sharp pointed collars and cropped jackets were new for the label, and a welcome addition to her repertoire of fitted dresses.

Pleated white tennis skirts and 
racer-back tanks had a sporty feel, heightened by the styling which teamed them with flat brogues and boots.

A delicate lattice pattern was a key 
detail; it appeared on dresses and tops on cutaway sections, as well as 
handbags and clutches.

Commenting on the line, Lauren Stevenson, PR Director at My-wardrobe.com said: 'It was good I see her move to separates - there was almost a Carven feel to some of the pieces such as the box skirts and cropped jackets.

'But there was a relaxed feel to the collection. I liked it, it's good to see her confidence growing with each collection.'

Done and dusted! Mrs Beckham Tweeted this picture of herself along with the caption: 'Relieved!!! Can't believe it's over. Thank you #vbteam!!!'

There were also more famous names in the front row than past seasons. As well as Anna Wintour and Mr Beckham, who also attended the last show, Vogue Japan's Anna Dello Russo was present this time (clad in Victoria Beckham, of course).

And tennis player Maria Sharapova wore hot pink trousers to take her seat in prime position next to Ms Wintour.

The designer herself wore a black minidress from the collection with the same towering peep-toe shoe-boots worn by her models.

Jackets, shirts and skirts were Mrs Beckham's first major foray into separates

The lattice pattern appeared on a clutch bag too (left). And instead of Mrs Beckham's favourite towering heels many models wore flat brogues and boots

Leading lights: Anna Wintour beamed as she took in the shows, as did David at a later event where he didn't have to stress for his wife
