New emails released Saturday in the Sony hack find Amy Pascal and another high-ranking executive inside the company blasting some major Hollywood players. 

Pascal and producer Mark Gordon trash Leonardo DiCaprio after the actor decided not to star in their Steve Jobs biopic Jobs in one email,  while another executive, Tom Rothman, blasts Jaden and Willow Smith for an interview the youngsters did with the New York Times.

In the exchange Pascal is sent a link by Tom Rothman, an executive at Tri-Star Productions, to a piece in which the Smith children claim they can control time and discuss 'Prana energy'.

The two add that they find nothing of worth in all the music and fiction produced by other people, so write their own albums and novels for entertainment.

Poking fun at the surreal article, Rothman emails Pascal saying:  '1. Read this. 2. they r home schooled: don’t let this family date your movies!!!'

In on portion of the piece, Jaden Smith, then 16, said: 'Honestly, we’re just trying to make music that we think is cool. We don’t think a lot of the music out there is that cool. So we make our own music.

'We don’t have any song that we like to listen to on the P.C.H. by any other artist, you know?'

Willow adds: 'That’s what I do with novels. There’re no novels that I like to read so I write my own novels, and then I read them again, and it’s the best thing.' 

Rothman's comments came despite the fact that Jaden Smith has starred in three Sony blockbuster films : The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Karate Kid and After Earth. 

There is a little bit of a silver lining to the new leak though, as one exchange reveals that one of the hottest, and handsomest, actors in Hollywood is a big fan of Pascal - Ryan Gosling.

Trashed: Amy Pascal labeled Leonardo DiCaprio (above) 'despicable' after he dropped out of the studio's Steve Jobs biopic

These new email exchanges were released by The Daily Beast, and all involve Pascal.

Like many of the emails, the first exchange deal with the frequently problematic Jobs picture the studio is working on, and the moment DiCaprio decided to pull out of the film.

Pascal tells the film's producer, Gordon, that the actor just changed his mind about doing the picture, to which Gordon responds 'Horrible behavior.'

Pascal takes it a step further however, writing back 'Actually despicable.'

Fun friend: The emails also revealed that Ryan Gosling (above) is a big fan of Pascal

Making it all a little better though are the gushing emails about Gosling's affection for Pascal.

Gosling's talent manager, Ilene Feldman, writes to Pascal after she met with her client: 'Ryan absolutely loved you. Said it was like speed dating because he was late after hitting every wrong gate on the lot.' 

She then adds: 'Not it should turn to marriage. He really wants to do something with you.'

What's more it seems that the movie Gosling is interested in doing is the Ghostbusters remake at the studio. 

Hannah Minghella, the co-president of production at Columbia, writes in an email to Pascal after learning this: 'There is one make [male] part paul is planning. How insane would that be… He also wants jennifer [Lawrence] and Emma [Stone].'

Very insane indeed.
