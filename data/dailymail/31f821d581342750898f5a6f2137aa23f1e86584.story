When a man handed out envelopes to supermarket shoppers on Christmas Eve, most people thought he was advertising an in-store promotion.

He slipped the letters into trolleys and baskets, wishing  customers a merry Christmas before moving swiftly on.

But the envelopes weren’t filled with vouchers or adverts – they each contained a £50 note.

Generous gesture: A mystery man stunned shoppers in a Devonshire supermarket when handed out wads of £50 notes with this note attached

One lucky shopper at the Tesco store in 
Sampford Peverell, Devon, said yesterday that the envelopes also held a 
letter, with the following message: ‘Happy Christmas. I have recently 
been fortunate enough to have come into quite a lot of money – more than
I need for myself and my family. So I thought that I would share some 
of it with other people – the £50 enclosed is for you.

‘I hope this enables you to have a little extra cheer this Christmas. 
You do not have to do anything other than spend the money – and it is 
real, there is no trick, no hidden cameras or catch. Just have a happy 
Christmas.’

The recipient, a retired teacher, said that after leaving the store he 
took the cash to the bank, where staff confirmed it was a genuine 
banknote.

‘The man just smiled, wished us a merry Christmas and was on his way,’ he said.

‘I am sure he was giving out other envelopes and it’s such an incredible
gesture.’ He admitted that he and his wife nearly threw the blank 
envelope away. ‘I’m glad we didn’t,’ he added.

Luke Davies, the supermarket’s manager, said the grey-haired mystery 
benefactor had made quite an impression. ‘Several customers have 
mentioned him,’ he said.

‘I don’t know why he would do it, but if it’s what it appears to be it’s a very generous thing to do.’

The grey-haired benefactor, whose identity is unknown, handed out the cash in Tesco in Tiverton shortly before Christmas

One elderly couple, who even took the
note to a bank to get it authenticated, couldn't believe the man's generosity.

The husband, who is in his eighties, said: 'He just smiled, wished us a merry Christmas and was on his way.

'I am sure he was giving out other envelopes and it’s such an incredible gesture.

'The envelope was blank and we nearly threw it away, but I am glad we didn’t. It was such a fantastic gesture.

'You don’t really expect supermarket shopping in the run-up to Christmas to be such a wonderful experience.'

His wife, who is in her seventies, added: 'We are hugely grateful to this man for such a lovely gift.

'It’s not just about the money, it 
just made us feel that there are people out there who are genuinely good
and selfless, and realise there is more to life than money.

'We couldn’t think of any other way of contacting him other than to do it through the press.'
