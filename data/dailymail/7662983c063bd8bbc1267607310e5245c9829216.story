Two young boys wept when they saw their family's cat Madison again for the first time, after she was believed lost for over two months. 

At the beginning of a video posted to YouTube, a mother identified in the video description as Sheryl warns three children sitting on a couch to keep their faces covered with their faces covered  until she gives the all-clear.

They are heard shrieking as the suspense builds.

Sweet surprise: A mother had her children keep their eyes covered before they saw their missing cat again 

It's her! The boys are overwhelmed when they realize their missing cat is back home 

Reunited: One of the boy's emotionally clings to their favorite feline 

'Okay, you can look,' she says.

The two boys and a girl take pillows and blankets off their faces - and yell excitedly as they see their lost cat being held by another girl.

'I knew it! I knew it!' a blond boy is heard yelling.

He walks toward another girl holding the pet, and cries as he embraces the returned feline. His brother and sister quickly follow.

A brown-haired boy, identified later in the video as Shane, asks where the cat was found.

Sheryl is heard saying 'She was down by the Shell gas station. I found her today.'

Overcome: Shane (in green) was seen sobbing after learning cat Maddie was back home 

'I'm so happy': Shane was overjoyed to see 13-year-old Maddie again 

Shane sobs, with reddened a nose and eyes, as the blond boy is heard saying 'I knew it, I knew it,' before he briefly embraces the cat then walks off camera.

'What do you think, Shane?' Sheryl asks. 

In between sobs, he replies 'I'm so happy,' and wipes the tears from his face.

'Let it all out,' a girl is heard saying in the clip. 

After petting the returned cat, Shane asks 'What was she doing when you found her? Sleeping, or-'

'No, she was following two little girls,' the woman says.

'Do we look like girls to you?' Shane says to his blond brother - who firmly replies 'No!'

In an intimate moment, the blond boy is seen standing with his forehead pressed against the head of the cat.

Home sweet home: Shane's younger brother presses his head against family cat Madison 

In a statement to Rumble, Sheryl said 'Madison is our 13+ year old one eyed cat.The boys 11 and 9 have known her all their lives. She is super sweet and love spending her spare time hanging out on peoples shoulders. When we got her she was so tiny we had to feed her with a bottle and take her with us if we were going to be gone for more than three hours.

'Around two+ months ago she got out, we guessed our other cat that knows how to open the patio screen assisted Maddie. The day I posted the video, was the day I found her. I leave early to get the boys from school and as I drove and was about 1/2 mile away form our house when I noticed a cat walking behind some kids.

'At first I thought "wow, that looks like Maddie" and as I glanced again I noticed her fall to the ground and roll trying to get the kids to pet her. This was a trademark Maddie move! I zipped the car around and ran to her."IT WAS HER!" Excited, I called my daughter(18) to tell her the good news. 

'She met me at the door with tears in her eyes. I told her I will be back with the boys and I wanted to surprise them and to wait with Maddie in her room. And the video is them seeing her for the first time in months.'
