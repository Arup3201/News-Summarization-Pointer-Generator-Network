Health chiefs in North Wales have been forced to recruit more than 70 Spanish nurses, amid a staffing crisis gripping the country's health system.

It has emerged the situation in recruiting staff to posts in the Labour-run Welsh NHS is so desperate that managers have resorted to interviewing potential candidates via Skype.

It comes as experts blamed a failure to reach A&E waiting times, in part, on an inability to recruit doctors and nurses across the UK.

New figures published yesterday revealed A&E waiting times have reached their lowest levels in England in a decade.

Just 92.6 per cent of patients were seen within the four-hour time - short of the 95 per cent target dictated by the NHS in England.

However politicians highlighted English A&Es are still performing better than those in the Labour-run Welsh NHS.

In November, just 83.3 per cent of patients in Wales were seen within the four-hour time period, short of the 95 per cent target. 

As well as a rising number of patients across the UK, experts warned a staffing crisis is hampering emergency departments.

Responding to the English figures yesterday, Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: 'Hospital trusts trying to recruit more staff have been hamstrung by the short-sighted cuts to nurse training places, which mean there simply aren't enough nurses in the system.

'This is made worse by chronic under-resourcing of community services and social care, which means more people end up in A&E who could be better treated elsewhere.'

Health officials in North Wales said 45 of the 70 new nurses have already started work at the region's three major hospitals, Gwynedd in Bangor, Glan Clwyd in Rhyl and Wrexham Maelor.

The remaining nurses are expected to move to Wales to start work this year.

Hospitals recruited almost 6,000 overseas nurses last year, a four-fold increase on the previous year.

Four out of five new NHS nurses are foreign, with managers flying to Spain and Portugal to hire up to 50 at a time. 

Figures released last month show that hospitals hired 5,778 foreign nurses last year, up from 1,360 the year before.

However there are fears that severe staffing shortages are leading managers to lower the bar for recruits’ English skills. 

Last month the Daily Mail visited a recruitment fair in Porto, Portugal, where Bedford Hospital hired four nurses.  

A spokesman for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board admitted that it, like many other NHS bodies, was 'struggling to recruit new recruits from within the UK'.

The board is working with Bangor and Glyndwr Universities to train nurses to degree level.

But the process takes three years, and the need to recruit new staff is immediate.

The spokesman said: 'We need to attract qualified nurses. 

'The requirements have not changed. It takes a period of time to get degrees, you also need experience.

'During 2014 we recruited more than 70 nurses from Spain; 45 of these have now moved to Wales and taken up their posts, with the rest due to join us this year.' 

He added that all new Spanish nurses spoke English and some were also in the process of learning Welsh.

'We do not require staff to learn Welsh as a condition of their employment,' he added.

'Where a post requires a Welsh speaker then this forms part of the recruitment and selection criteria.

'However, as a health board we do provide active support to staff who wish to learn to speak Welsh and a number of the nurses from Spain have expressed an interest in and have commenced learning the language.'

Welsh Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said: 'There have been consistent problems in the recruitment and retention of doctors and nurses across North Wales for some time, so it is pleasing to see action to begin to address staffing shortages.

It comes as experts said the staffing crisis - an inability to recruit sufficient numbers of doctors and nurses from within the UK - is hampering efforts to improve waiting times in A&E.

New figures published on Tuesday, revealed A&E waiting times in England have fallen to their lowest levels in a decade with just 92.6 per cent of patients seen within four hours - short of the 95 per cent target. But despite the poor performance, politicians have pointed out English A&Es are performing better than those in the Labour-run Welsh NHS, where just 83.8 per cent of patients were seen within four hours in November

'What matters most to hospital patients is not the birthplace of their nurse, but that medically trained nurses are on hand in sufficient numbers to provide safe and high quality care.

'While recruiting nurses from abroad suggests the scale of recruitment problems in Wales, many patients will welcome increased nurse numbers on hospital wards in North Wales.

'The use of Skype to interview prospective employees may seem unorthodox for the NHS but it is a tool which is often used to interview remote candidates by private businesses and can help to keep recruitment costs down - I have no problem with it.'

However, Plaid Cymru North Wales Assembly Member Llyr Gruffydd said: 'For such a large organisation, it’s surprising that the health board is unable to plan its workforce recruitment without having to use an agency to go to Spain to recruit additional staff.

'Nurse training at Glyndwr University has been reduced in the past couple of years and now we’re seeing the results of that with having to go overseas to recruit 70 Spanish nurses.

'It smacks of stop-gap measures rather than long-term planning and, although I understand the nurses in question are very experienced and highly qualified, you have to wonder how long they intend to stay in Wales.'
