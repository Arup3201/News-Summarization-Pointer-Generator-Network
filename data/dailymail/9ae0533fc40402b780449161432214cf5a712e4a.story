The pathetic excuses from friends and colleagues defending Steven Gerrard have been a joke.

Unfortunately for arguably Liverpool’s greatest-ever player, he proved on Sunday that Brendan Rodgers has made the correct decision to cut him loose from Anfield at the end of this season. I’d be surprised if Gerrard makes the Liverpool starting line-up again, and any substitute appearances will surely only be to give the fans a wave goodbye.

Why should Rodgers trust Gerrard again this season?

This is an experienced professional, a captain, a legend and there is nothing anyone can say that should mask the truth that he absolutely let everyone at Liverpool Football Club down.

He also failed to apologise to Ander Herrera in his brief post-match interview, which showed a lack of class.

Some said Gerrard was frustrated because he wasn’t in the starting line-up. That might be true, but it doesn’t excuse a violent stamp on an opponent’s ankle.

Others have said he was desperate to get involved and show his passion. After all his years in the game, with all his knowledge of this fixture, he must surely know there is only one way to show passion and commitment on such a huge occasion – and that’s to make good, clean tackles, play well and get the job done.

This was Liverpool’s biggest game of the season, against fierce rivals, it’s a game they’re losing when he comes on the pitch and it’s a game they need to win.

If Wayne Rooney had done it, the reaction would be far worse. There would be calls to strip him of the England captaincy.

If it had been Joey Barton, the reaction would have hit fever pitch.

Had it been a Chelsea player – well, the internet and the FA would have been in meltdown. There would have been talk of points deductions probably.

But because it was Gerrard, the appropriate outrage has been tempered because apparently, according to the apologists, Rodgers made a mistake by failing to put him in the starting line-up.

Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton would have been ridiculed if he had made such a challenge 

Last season’s slip against Chelsea was accidental, the stamp on Sunday was calculated: at best it was Gerrard being a careless hot-head desperate to make a mark. At worst, it looked like a reckless player who is now past caring about the fortunes of his club.

Gerrard was the main man responsible for one of Liverpool’s most glorious nights back in 2005 in Istanbul. Nobody can ever take that away from him.

Ten years on, there’s a good chance that Gerrard’s last significant act for his club could be a red card that proves to be a major factor in handing Manchester United a passage back into the Champions League – at Liverpool’s expense.

Gerrard’s legacy is shattered. It’s a sad and sorry way to go, but he only has himself to blame.
