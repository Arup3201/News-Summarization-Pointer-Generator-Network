At first glance these pictures show depressingly familiar scenes of fields of poppies in the wilds of strife-hit Afghanistan - soon to be processed into heroin and shipped around the world.

But these scenes were actually captured at an 88 acre farm near Winchester in Hampshire. The flowers are identical to those grown in Afghanistan but, instead of funding global crime syndicates, they will be used to treat those in desperate pain.

The UK crop covers an estimated 6,300 acres on farms across the nation and will be harvested by a pharmaceutical company to produce pain-relieving drugs, such as codeine and morphine.

Morphine has traditionally been imported to the West from Tasmania, Spain and Turkey, but now an increasing number of lilac poppies are grown in the UK to reduce costs.

The morphine poppy, Papaver somniferum, was first grown commercially on British farms in 2002 and now it can be seen around Dorset, Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire and Hampshire.

The medicinal properties of opium have been known from ancient times, and it was used as a narcotic in European cultures as early as 4,000BC

Once the poppies have dried the seed capsule and top two inches of stem will be removed.

The seed will then be cleaned for the culinary markets, as poppy seed contains no morphine and the rest will be milled, pelletised and shipped to a special plant for extraction.

The morphine is found in the structure of the seed capsule and the top two inches of the stem.

Medicinal poppies are a different species to the common wild red poppy which contains no morphine.

They have a white and lilac colouring and the Latin name means the 'sleep-bringing poppy', which is a reference to its narcotic properties.

Morphine is a medicine which is used in relieving severe pain, especially after operations. Its effects will last for a long time after you have taken it.

It works by affecting chemicals in the brain and nervous system which are involved in the sensation of pain.

Morphine sulphate can cause dependence but this is not a major concern when it is used in the treatment of severe pain.
