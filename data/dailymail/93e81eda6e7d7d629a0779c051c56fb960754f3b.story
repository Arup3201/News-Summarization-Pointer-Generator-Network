A mother of a student whose body was found on a motorway in Germany 12 years ago believes he was tortured by a right wing cult in the days before his death.

Erica Duggan says her 22-year-old son Jeremiah, from north London, died after attending a youth event organised by the far-right 'cult'.

The German police concluded that his death was 'a suicide by means of a traffic accident'.

But the Jewish student's family have never accepted that ruling and in May 2010 the High Court ordered a fresh UK inquest after judges said evidence of possible foul play must be investigated.

Today it was announced the inquest will start next March. 

Campaign: Jeremiah Duggan, 22, was found dead on a German motorway in 2003 in an apparent suicide but his mother Erica has successfully fought for a new inquest

Jeremiah, a student at the British institute and the Sorbonne, went from France to Weisbaden in Germany to join what he believed was a protest against the war in Iraq. 

His mother believes Jeremiah began to be aware and criticise the virulent anti-Semitic views of the group. 

Mrs Duggan struggled to hold back tears as she told a pre-inquest hearing what she had learned about the 'dangerous' techniques used by groups like these to control their members, and the unwillingness of the German investigators to look into it.

Jeremiah, a student at the British institute and the Sorbonne, went from France to Germany and was staying in this apartment block Weisbaden before he died

She told North London Coroners Court: 'In the past 11 years there has been an unwillingness to look at the danger that can cause an innocent person like Jeremiah to become a victim. This is a danger I was ignorant of.

'There has been an unwillingness to look at what the danger is. This is the danger that leads to extremism, which is particularly common today, the danger that leads young people to become suicide bombers and destroys communities

'This is what is called in France mental manipulation and subjugation, and which with the rise of social media and new techniques becomes very dangerous.

'Trying to find out what happened to Jeremiah might help people shake off this fear and its different forms.

'There has been an unwillingness to look into the psychological harm caused to him.' 

During the hearing, she also accused the German investigators of 'time wasting' in order to ensure the case was not properly investigated.

She said she had asked repeatedly for Germany to send a mutual aid request to France to allow the courts to access evidence into Jeremiah's death, but during a recent visit to France she discovered the requests had not been received.

She said: 'There has been terrible time wasting. The case started in France, there is a law in France, Picard's Law, which makes what happened to Jeremiah in terms of the mental manipulation a crime.

'I spoke to the highest French authorities to see if they had received the mutual aid request from Germany, they had heard nothing.

'They are hoping to delay the inquest by dragging the investigation on. The same person who destroyed evidence in the first investigation is holding this one up.'

Coroner Andrew Walker ruled there was enough evidence for an inquest to be carried out and set a date for March 17 next year.

Tragedy: Mr Duggan died in Germany in 2003 and was found here on Route 455, the Bundestrasse, near Weisbaden

He said: 'I have no doubt the inquest should proceed. But I am not here to investigate the investigators. I am here to determine the circumstances behind Jeremiah Duggan's death.'

Mrs Duggan expressed her relief that, after nearly 15 years since her son died, she might finally have answers.

She told the court: 'This inquest will expose the dangers of what happened to Jeremiah and will mean his family won't have to go on struggling and will allow his family to come to terms with his death.'

After the hearing she added the German legal system was 'broken'.

She said: 'It is clear his death has not been investigated. In my view Germany's higher court has no method of ensuring the investigation will be carried out.

'I am glad the inquest will be held and the time has come to expose the danger he faced.'

Speaking after the hearing she claimed: 'My son was subjected to sleep deprivation, mental manipulation and other coercive techniques. I have evidence Jeremiah was subjected to that from his lecture notes and briefings.'
