Fabian Delph became the 72nd Villa player to be capped by England while an Aston Villa player - meaning they have had more Three Lions players than any other club

Delph replaced Jack Wilshere in the 70th minute of Roy Hodgson's side's 1-0 win over Norway for his international debut. 

Despite not having an English player capped since Darren Bent and Stewart Downing’s respective call-ups in 2011, Villa lead the way with the most England representatives, closely followed by Liverpool, who have had 68 stars play for the Three Lions.

Up and running: Fabian Delph will be hoping to earn more England call-ups in the future

James Milner - who also featured against Norway - appeared for England 12 times during his spell at Villa. However, Villa’s most capped player at senior level is the country's current Under 21 boss Gareth Southgate, who amassed 57 appearances between 1995 and 2004, scoring twice.

Villa have a long-running history with successful English players at the club, with eight of the 11 players who won the 1982 European Cup being born in the country. Peter Withe, who scored the winning goal in Villa’s 1-0 defeat of Bayern Munich, represented his nation 11 times.

Three Aston Villa players - Howard Spencer, Billy Walker and Frank Moshave - previously captained the national side, accumulating 29 appearances between them.
