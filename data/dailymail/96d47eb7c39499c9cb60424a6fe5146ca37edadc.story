In a potentially threatening blow to California’s porn industry voters have passed a measure that will require condom use during production despite fear it could put Los Angeles’ porn industry dually under wrap.

Passed by 55.9 per cent of voters on Tuesday, Measure B will additionally raise fees in adult film productions potentially driving out the industry from L.A., according to the ballot's opposition.

'The effect would be simply to have no 
scenes, or much, much fewer scenes shot in Los Angeles,' John Stagliano,
 also known as 'Buttman' who owns Evil Angel, one of the nation's top 
porn production companies, told Buzz Feed before
 the measure’s passing.

Bundled up: Measure B, which passed by 55.9 per cent of voters, requires actors in Los Angeles' porn industry to wear condoms while also raising porn production costs in the city

Fees: A porn actress sits on the set of an adult movie shoot in California, one of many who will be affected by the mandate that also requires a public health permit and a permit fee

In addition to condoms promoting safer sex and preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, the measure would 'require producers of adult films to obtain a public health permit from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and pay a permit fee' to fund its enforcement.

Fear of those rising costs earned support against the measure by the Los Angeles Times in an editorial late last month.

‘Though it is well intentioned, requiring the use of condoms in adult movies is likely to stymie L.A. County government and bring little benefit to performers,’ the paper wrote.

The measure, pressed by the AIDS 
Healthcare Foundation, is modelled after similar health permits applied 
to tattoo shops, massage parlours and bathhouses.

Opposition: John Stagliano, owner of Evil Angel, one of the top porn production companies in the country, has rallied against the measure saying with its passing he may move his business outside the city

The paper sides with the promotion of
 safe sex with a recent LA Times blog article reporting adult 
film stars in Los Angeles County having higher rates of gonorrhea and 
chlamydia than legal prostitutes in Nevada.

The paper argues the promotion of condom use without 
government force, however, fearing the measure could negatively effect an 
estimated $1billion to $2billion industry.

'My general manager pointed out that it’s far more dangerous to play Little League baseball than it is to perform in porn without condoms. And it’s true,' Mr Stagliano argued to the Buzz Feed.

'I played Little League baseball, and I got hit in the head a few times. It was far more dangerous, and I risked more than I physically risked being in porn, and I did not get HIV from being in porn,' he said.

With the measure's passing Mr Stagliano said he expects some scenes to go underground while he personally expects ‘to just shoot in other places.'

Benefits: Supporters of the mandate argued its protection against STDs with a recent study finding that 28 per cent of 168 performers in Los Angeles County having gonorrhea, chlamydia or both

Siding with Mr Stagliano, last month performers Tera Patrick and Ron Jeremy argued in a public service announcement that since 2000 only six porn performers have tested positive for HIV.

In comparison, with Measure B supporters likening condom use as way to protect workers in the workplace - much the same like helmets at construction sites - the actors argue that in the same time period over 60,000 Americans died from far more dangerous occupations.

As the LA Times reported, 28 per cent of 168 performers tested were found having either gonorrhea or chlamydia or both diseases using research from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, the Johns 
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and UCLA.

Responding to those numbers and a possible affect by the measure's passing, Evil Angel's general manager Christian Mann told the Times it 'does zero to ameliorate the spread of gonorrhea or chlamydia among this population.'

Mr Stagliano says he and others plan to challenge the measure in court hopeful of an injunction.

In opposition, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation hailed the measure's passing as a major victory in their fight against STDs, touting that 'taxpayers pay over $500,000 for every HIV Infection that ends in free clinics.

'Most performers have no health insurance!' they wrote on their Facebook page.

Lot to think about: Voters at the L.A. County lifeguard headquarters are seen casting their vote not only for the Presidential race but to mandate condoms

Other concerns: Also on the ballot, arguing whether to maintain the state's death penalty, 54 per cent of voters checked in its favour despite concerns it is costing hundreds of millions of dollars unnecessarily

Softer stance: Voters in California also opted for a loosening of the state's 'three strike' rules against habitual criminals

Early voting results to proposition 34 showed a 54 per cent opposition to end its use.

Campaigners
 in favour of abolishing capital punishment had based their argument on 
the question of cost rather than morality, saying the financially 
troubled state could save hundreds of millions of dollars by instead 
jailing the worst killers for life.

While California voters appeared to 
oppose ending the death penalty, they broadly approved another ballot 
measure to soften the state's controversial 'three strikes' law, which 
gives longer sentences to habitual criminals.

The
 'three strikes' reform measure had received over 68 per cent of the 
vote after two-thirds of the precincts had declared, and organisers 
declared victory.

The 
proposition would let some criminals who have been in jail twice avoid a
 25 years to life sentence for a third crime if it is judged to be 
non-violent and non-serious.

Supporters
 of the measure argued that filling prisons with people who presented no
 threat to society is expensive and is often counter-productive in 
rehabilitating them away from crime. 

'This historic victory overturns the 
long-held conventional wisdom that it's impossible to fix our most 
extreme and unjust crime laws - and hopefully inspires future efforts,' 
said campaign spokesman Dan Newman.

However, efforts to abolish the death penalty fell short with just 46 per cent of the vote.

Public
 opinion in the United States has been moving away from the death 
penalty, with five states abolishing it during the past decade. 
Seventeen states and the District of Columbia do not allow the death 
penalty.

A federal judge 
halted all California executions in 2006, saying a three-drug lethal 
injection risked causing inmates too much pain and suffering before 
death. Executions have not yet resumed.

Despite the suspension of this deterrent, crime in California, like the rest of the nation, has continues to fall dramatically.
