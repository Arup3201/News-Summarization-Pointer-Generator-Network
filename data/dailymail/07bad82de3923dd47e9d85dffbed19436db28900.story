Britain has become the first nation across the finishing line in choosing a training venue for the 2016 Olympics in Rio. 

The British Olympic Association (BOA) has decided that Team GB will use a world-class sports facility in Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais, Brazil, in the weeks running up to the Games.

The 400-strong team of elite athletes will train at the Minas Tênis Club - a multi-purpose centre boasting state-of-the-art facilities in a range of sports.

World-class: Team GB will train at the Minas Tênis Club, which features a world-class strength and fitness gym

Impressive: The centre in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, boats state-of-the-art facilities, including a purpose-built pool

Ideal: It is just down the road from a nine-track athletics track, expansive field facilities and an artificial lake

The venue, which features a specially designed strength and fitness gym, is just down the road from a nine-lane athletics track, expansive field facilities and an artificial training lake.

At a signing ceremony in Belo Horizonte on Wednesday, Lord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the BOA, said: 'This is a very exciting 
day for Team GB and an important moment as we build the bridge from 
London 2012 to Rio 2016.

'At
such an important moment for our athletes, in the lead up to probably 
the biggest event in their careers, we want them to be based in a 
welcoming community.

'We
believe we have found the best possible environment in Belo Horizonte 
for our athletes to prepare for the Games and all the 
partners have shown their commitment to understanding and meeting our 
needs.'

As England’s football squad celebrates gaining a place in next year’s FIFA World Cup in Brazil, the BOA is not leaving anything to chance.

Organisers say they are determined to ensure the UK’s Olympic athletes are given every opportunity to repeat the 69 medal haul won in last year’s London Games and exceed expectations in the 2016 international arena in Rio.

The search for a suitable location in Brazil begun over a year ago as the Olympic flame in London was extinguished.

It involved extensive studies and investigations into over a dozen different locations and venues across the South American country.

Simon Timson, director of performance for UK Sport, said: 'Team GB and the BOA have worked incredibly hard and left no stone unturned to try to find the right venue in the right location within Brazil to ensure that we can have one team on one mission best prepared for Rio.

'The club is an hour from Rio, in the same time zone and has the same climate.

'You only have to walk around to see that it is going to provide a world class environment for our athletes.'

The 471,000-square metre athletics centre, which has more than 73,000 members, boasts world-class facilities in nine different sports - basketball, men and women’s volleyball, swimming, judo, trampoline, gymnastics, tennis and futsal.

Team GB's track and field competitors will be able to travel to the nearby Minas Gerais Federal University to use the nine-lane athletics track and impressive field facilities.

'Exciting': At the ceremony, Lord Coe said: 'This is a very exciting day for Team GB and an important moment as we build the bridge from London 2012 to Rio 2016'

Practice: An elite athlete practises trampolining at the centre in the southern-central state of Minas Gerais

Incredible: The centre has state-of-the-art facilities in nine sports, including men's and women's basketball

'We are extremely proud to be chosen to 
host Team GB during their preparations for the Olympics,' said Antônio 
Anastasia, state governor of Minas Gerais, during a signing ceremony 
with Lord Coe on Wednesday.

'This is the first agreement signed in the country between an international sporting body and a city, and state.

'We are satisfied that we will be able to provide our guests with first-rate conditions.'

Marcio Lacerda, mayor of Belo Horizonte, added: 'The high level of British professional athletes training on our home ground will inspire our own athletes to strive for their best during the Olympics and spur our youngsters on to take up sports.'

Karen Robers, team leader for UK Judo and former judo champion, said the training facility was 'fantastic'.

Handy: It is nearby to a nine-lane athletics track - ideal for Team GB's sprinters and long-distance runners

Suitable for all: An elite team of athletes play volleyball at the Minas Tênis Club

'The facilities are exceptional,' she said. 'As we walked into the centre it felt so professional.

'It’s going to be like going from home to home for our professional athletes.

'They’ll want to come here and feel like they will be able to fit in straight away and they’ll have no problem doing that.'

The
Minas Tênis Clube is already home to national and South American 
championship teams in swimming, volleyball and basketball - with the 
2012 London Olympic Bronze medal winner in judo training on its 
premises.

As well as serving as an Olympic base, Belo Horizonte was one of the host cities for the Confederations Cup in June this year.

Training: Brazilian youngsters train in judo at the world-class facility, which will welcome Team GB in 2016

It is also set to host six matches during next year's World Cup.

The city was famously the site of one of the greatest upsets in British sporting history when England lost a 1950 World Cup pool match to rank underdogs the United States.

Millions of dollars are currently being invested in the construction of around 29 new hotels to accommodate the anticipated influx of visitors during the World Cup and Olympics.

Major infrastructure work involving new roadways and bus routes for the FIFA games are also ongoing causing disruptive traffic jams on the roads.

However, the host city is confident that the problems will be resolved in time for the international sporting events.
