Labour has moved to suspend a councillor after sharing a parody of a Tory election poster featuring a picture of Auschwitz.

Nottingham councillor Rosemary Healy claimed not to have noticed the doctored image had replaced the 'road to recovery' with the railway leading to the Nazi death camp.

However, the creator of the controversial graphic, Thomas Pride, defended the parody and joked it had caused a bit of 'spluttering outrage and controversy'.

The controversial image was posted by Twitter user Thomas Pride, and retweeted by Labour councillor Rosemary Healy

The image was based on a poster unveiled by David Cameron last week, with the message 'Let's stay on the road to a stronger recovery'

Ms Healy, who represents the Mapperley ward on Nottingham City Council, retweeted the picture to more than 1,500 followers on Twitter

Ms Healy later tweeted 'profound apologies' and claimed not to have noticed the picture included Auschwitz

Ms Healy, who represents the Mapperley ward on Nottingham City Council, retweeted the picture to more than 1,500 followers on Twitter.

She later expressed 'profound apologies' and has deleted her Twitter profile.

Labour confirmed that the council's executive assistant for community protection had been suspended amid closer-than-ever scrutiny of politicians' internet postings in the run-up to May's general elections.

The original post shared by Ms Healy was an altered version of a Tory poster - the original of which was mocked after it emerged the photo of a country road featured above the slogan 'Let's stay on the road to a stronger economy' was of one in Germany, not the UK.

It was posted by the @ThomasPride account but replaced the road with a picture of the railway lines leading into the notorious Auschwitz camp where more than a million people - almost all Jews - died during the Second World War.

'The new Tory campaign poster featuring a German road's a bit controversial' the post quipped - adding the slogan 'more people on zero hours, more tax cuts for the rich, no more NHS'.

The creator of the image was unrepentant, and reposted it after the row broke out last night

Pride also hit back at critics of what he called his 'satire' of Conservative election promises

Ms Healy quickly deleted the Tweet and posted: 'Profound apologies for that retweet which was a genuine mistake and would never have been retweeted had I recognised it for what it was.'

The Conservative group leader on Nottingham City Council, Cllr Georgina Culley, told the website:  'This trivialises the horrors of the holocaust and I think Councillor Healy and her party should be ashamed.

'The city council should also act to distance itself from the perpetuation of these tweets, such remarks are offensive and a public representative should know better.'

The user of the Thomas Pride account defended the image against complaints from others on the social media network that it was 'deeply ignorant' and 'belittles the Holocaust' - insisting it was legitimate satire and that he was of Polish descent.
