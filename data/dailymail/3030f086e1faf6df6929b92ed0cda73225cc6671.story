Sinking a simple putt may have won him the Open – but was there a greater driving force behind Rory McIlroy’s triumph? A budding romance, perhaps?

The victory – and spectacular return to form – meant the 25-year-old golf star became the third youngest player to win three major championships.

It all coincides with his blossoming friendship with Irish lingerie model Nadia Forde.

After being introduced by mutual friends last year, the pair have remained tight-lipped about  the nature of their relationship. Meanwhile McIlroy’s ex-fiancee, Danish tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, 24, seems to be thriving on being a single woman after winning the Istanbul Cup on Sunday – her first title of the year.

McIlroy and Forde, 25, certainly seem to be getting closer. He missed a practice session before the Open when he learnt that she had been involved in a car crash last weekend.

Her Fiat 500 Abarth flipped six times before crashing into the central reservation on the M40 in Warwickshire when she was driving from London to Manchester. She suffered only minor bruising and a bump to her head.

After the crash, McIlroy said: ‘If anyone is involved in a car crash you are glad to see they are OK but yeah, obviously, it was a pretty scary incident.’

The golfer, who split from Wozniacki in May after the couple sent out their wedding invitations, has been reluctant to answer questions about any potential new romance. But after he was spotted getting close to Forde in a Dublin bar earlier this month, he rediscovered the kind of golfing form which propelled him to the top of the world rankings two years ago.

Forde is a model, actress and singer who regularly appears on Irish television.

She has previously described McIlroy as a ‘lovely guy’, although she too has been coy about the nature of their relationship.

Beautiful people: McIlroy won his first Open title not long after his rumoured romance started. Coincidence?

‘The bottom line with me and Rory is we have mutual friends who introduced us and we’ve been in each other’s company,’ she said.

When asked if the golfer was her type she replied: ‘I don’t really have a type, to be honest with you.’

Forde said her ideal man would be ‘a bit of a cheeky chappie who makes me laugh ... a guy with a twinkle in his eye’.

She added: ‘For me it’s not about looks. It’s about the person. I think whoever I end up with I will be friends with first.

‘The important thing is having somebody with ambition and drive who is hard-working. That for me is a massive turn-on.’

The model did not attend the Open at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club, in Hoylake, the Wirral, despite speculation that she might make an appearance.

She is thought to be in Florida. All the same McIlroy punched the air with delight, then hugged his tearful mother Rosie after sinking a simple putt to clinch the Claret Jug – and a cheque for £975,000 – by two shots last night.

Describing his win, the Northern Irishman told the BBC: ‘It feels incredible. It wasn’t easy. There were a few guys making runs at me and I just needed to stay focused.

‘To win three legs of the grand slam at 25 is a pretty  big achievement.’

He added: ‘This is the first major my mum has been to that I’ve won, so mum, this one’s for you. 

‘I just can’t wait to get back and defend this thing at St Andrews next year.’
