Prosecutors say they have filed appeal papers against the verdict and sentence in the Oscar Pistorius case.

The prosecution is appealing against Judge Thokozile Masipa's decision to acquit Pistorius of murder for shooting girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. 

Judge Masipa found the Olympic runner guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide, or manslaughter.

Prosecutors want to overturn the culpable homicide verdict to retry the case for a stiffer jail sentence 

South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority said it had filed initial appeal papers, exactly two weeks after the double-amputee athlete was sentenced to five years in prison for killing Ms Steenkamp.

Prosecutors must first apply to Judge Masipa for permission to appeal against the verdict and sentence.

They say Pistorius should have been found guilty of murder. He would face a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted of murder on appeal.
