The parents of a 16-year-old Utah girl who disappeared on Friday are frantically trying to locate their daughter, believing she's been lured away by an older man she met online and is in danger.

Indica Hudderson's family have launched a full scale search for the teen, who vanished without her cell phone or any money, after police were treating it as a runaway case rather than foul play.

Bryan and Andrea Huddleston, from Alpine, said they had a minor argument with their daughter about school on Friday before they found a note saying she had left home. But they said one line in the message made them fear for her safety.

'The part that worries me is she says, "I'm fine; I'm being taken care of,"' Mrs Huddleston said to KSL.com. 'That doesn't sound right to me. It sounds like someone is luring her away.'

Her parents said Indica had recently been spending a lot of time online chatting to older men. They believe she could be in danger after searching through her Internet activity and reading conversations she had had with the men over the past few weeks.

'I didn't know she was talking to the kind of people she was talking to,' Mrs Huddleston said. 'I should have done a better job of monitoring, but I didn't.'

She also didn't take any money or her cell phone with her, which sparked suspicion.

Her father is frantic, believeing that if she was OK she would have been in touch by now. She has also failed to contact any friends or family on Facebook.

'I think she would have made contact by now if she was safe and well,' he said. 'I don't think she is safe and well.'

Her aunt added on her blog thelittlestblog.com: 'She is your typical sixteen year old obsessed with social media. If she were able to see our outpour of love, I know that she would have responded. At least to say, "tell my mom to calm down, I'm OK, I just don't want to go home." Every day we wake up without her is agonizing. I know she wouldn't sit and let this happen.'

Lone Peak Police Department detectives are now investigating the disappearance, however an Amber Alert has not yet been issued. The police refused to comment to KSL on why.

Indica's parents and her sister, Sierra, are working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and have started a social media campaign to get word out about the missing teen.

According to flyers, they believe she may be in other parts of Utah or cities including Seattle, Los Angeles and Las Vegas.

Indica is 5-foot-3, 128 pounds, and she has long brown hair and hazel eyes.

'We have reason to believe that she left with someone older who she trusted that might have ill intent,' Mrs Huddleston wrote on Facebook. 'It is not like her to run away, and it is even less like her to not be on social media (Facebook/Instagram) to at least let someone in her large network of friends and family know that she is OK.'
