A plastic surgeon has launched a brand of lingerie designed especially for women with mastectomies.

So far, New York-based Dr Sharon T McLaughlin-Weber, who had reconstructive surgery herself after a lymphoma diagnosis at 13, has released two intimate sleepwear bras and one bikini top for Courage Couture.

The items are designed to accommodate various weights of prosthetics, scarring and other issues associated with mastectomies.

Bras for a cause: New York-based plastic surgeon Dr Sharon T. McLaughlin-Weber has launched Courage Couture, a lingerie brand for women who have had mastectomies or reconstructive surgery

'I hope that one of my bikini designs 
will be featured in Sports Illustrated and be worn by a model that has 
had a mastectomy,' she told Fashionista, adding: 'She can be every bit as sexy as the next woman.'

Earlier this year, a Change.org petition was launched petitioning Victoria's Secret to design a similar line of lingerie for women who have had mastectomies.

Despite the petition amassing over 120,000 signatures, in the end the brand opted not to go through with the line, claiming that the creation of mastectomy bras is 'complicated and truly a science'.

But Dr McLaughlin-Weber said that she
doesn't understand why Victoria's Secret opted out of the opportunity, 
especially since it would have involved just a slight tweak to the 
designs they already have.

'I don't think brands have a responsibility to help women with mastectomies, but I would think they'd want to'

'[Victoria's Secret's] statement does not make any sense to me,' she said. 'They have the funding, facilities, designers and consultants to produce anything they want to produce.'

She added that the brand's Pink lace bralette is 'three quarters of the way there' anyway.

Courage Couture lingerie, which costs
$85 an item, is made from an elastic fabric which helps accommodate for
different weights of prosthetics.

Inspiration: Dr McLaughlin-Weber has used her own expertise as a plastic surgeon, as well as her experience having had reconstructive surgery after a lymphoma diagnosis at the age of 13

The bras and bikini also feature an 
adjustable bust, so that women with scars can choose how much or how 
little cleavage they want to show.

'The line was designed to allow woman to reveal more if they wanted to,' says the Courage Couture website.

'After all, our breasts may be altered but the rest of our body is the same as every other woman.'

The bras are also aimed at women who have uneven breasts - either from birth or from surgery.

While she is baffled by Victoria's Secret's decision not to launch a collection for women with mastectomies, Dr McLaughlin-Weber says she is happy to step in.

'I
do not think mass brands have a responsibility to help fill the needs 
of women with mastectomies,' she said. '[But] I would think they would 
want to.'
