A manhunt has been launched to find a 'very pregnant', caped woman suspected of committing four armed robberies across Atlanta.

The unidentified woman launched into a Walgreens store wrapped in a floor-length, bright pink shawl and told the cashier: 'I've got a gun and I want your money,' police claim.

She made off with $200 in a gold Nissan Maxima, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.

Wanted: Police are looking for this pregnant woman who they claim stole $200 from Walgreens using a gun

It came two weeks before a raid at a nearby CVS, and a worker described the same woman.

She allegedly told the clerk to 'stay calm' as she flashed a gun wrapped in muslin cloth, before taking $180 in cash.

Police are probing claims that the woman was also involved in a hold-up at a hair brading salon, where a beauty assistant wrestled a .32-caliber pistol out of her hands.

This week, she allegedly appeared in a grocery store - again in the pink cape - threatening the cashier with a gun.

Widespread? They released this image from another store and claim the suspect is connected to many raids
