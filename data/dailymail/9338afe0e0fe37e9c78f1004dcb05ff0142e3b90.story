A former ‘Sopranos’ actor who served eight years in prison has revealed he is now using his experience to teach lessons to younger would-be offenders.

Lillo Brancato Jr, who played a young mobster on the hit HBO show, ended up behind bars after a drug-fueled 2005 robbery attempt in the Bronx left a cop dead and him and his accomplice with gunshot wounds.

The 37-year-old was paroled in December, and hopes that his mistakes can help others avoid drugs and other bad decisions, he told WNYM. During a Sunday interview.

‘Here I am, I get the opportunity, I get the shot and then squander it, and do what I did, and get addicted to drugs and just make horrible decisions,’ he said. 

Brancato and a known member of the notorious Genovese crime family were downing drinks in a Bronx strip club when they decided to break into a nearby basement while fiending for valium, prosecutors said.

An off-duty cop heard them break a window and ran to stop the break-in. He soon ended up in a gun battle with Brancato and Steve Armento.

The officer shot both men but ended up dead. Armento was convicted of murder.

Brancato was acquitted of the killing, but did go to jail for attempted burglary.

He last got high in 2006 while in jail, he told the station.

The ex-con realizes his acting career, which started with a bit part in 1993’s ‘A Bronx Tale,’ may be over, but made his case to anyone listening.

‘At least see the person that I am today, see the person that I've grown up into,’ he insisted. ‘I definitely had to learn the hard way, but I am no longer that person who was present that night.’

Brancato says the hardest lesson he learned was ‘how to get through tough times’ without getting high, but it isn't clear which youth groups or organizations he is working with.

He will remain on parole until 2018.
