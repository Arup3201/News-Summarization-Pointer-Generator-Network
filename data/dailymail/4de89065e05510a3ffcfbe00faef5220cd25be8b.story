The Maccabi Haifa website has posted an official statement from club captain Yossi Benayoun commenting on Wednesday's violent scenes causing the Israeli club's pre-season friendly with Lille in Austria to be abandoned when pro-Palestinian protesters invaded the pitch.

Benayoun said: 'As a football club we condemn all acts of verbal and physical violence.

'Yesterday (on Wednesday) in the closing minutes of the match we were attacked by thugs on the pitch simply because we are Israelis. We had no choice but to defend ourselves.'

He continued: 'The older players saw it as our duty to defend the youth 
players and we asked them not to become involved in the brawl.

'As a team
 we are one unit who defend each other for better or worse. We ask our 
loyal fans not to judge any of us over this exceptional incident.'

With
 Lille winning 2-0, supporters of reportedly Turkish origin entered the 
pitch and headed for the Maccabi players, including captain Benayoun, formerly of Chelsea, Liverpool and QPR.

One
 of the players is seen to trip a fan before punches were thrown. The 
Maccabi stars - some of whom retaliated - managed to leave the field 
unhurt.

Maccabi coach Aleksandar Stanojevic was said to have punched a protester, and the referee was forced to stop the game in the 86th minute before eventually bringing the game to an early end.

Banners calling for the liberation of Palestine were also displayed by certain sections of the crowd. 

Israel is currently engaged in hostilities with Hamas, a militant group that runs the Gaza Strip.

Before the ugly scenes, Lille had been ahead thanks to goals from Ryan Mendes and Simon Kjaer.

Last month UEFA announced that Israeli clubs could not host European matches due to the 'unrest' in Israel.
