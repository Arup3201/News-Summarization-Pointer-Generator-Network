Charged: Jennifer Christine Fichter, 29 (pictured), allegedly confessed to having sex with her 17-year-old student for four months, falling in love with him and having an abortion

According to The Tampa Tribune, police said the abuse began in November when the pair had sex in the early 
morning hours in Fichter's Toyota pickup truck.

The teen told detectives he and Fichter met for sex three times in the parking lot of a Lakeland apartment complex and three times near New Tampa Highway.

He also said they had sex four times outside the city in Polk and Hillsborough. Lakeland police said those counties are investigating those incidents.

The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27. 

When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'.

Police said the mum confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter.

The mother reported Fichter to police yesterday, however it is not clear why she waited so long.

Last night, the mother agreed to speak to Fichter and record the conversation for investigators.

During the call, Fichter allegedly admitted she became pregnant with the teen’s child and had an abortion. Fichter also said she was in love with the student and wanted to continue seeing him.

'The victim's mother discovered this relationship after reviewing text messages from her son and she asked that Fichter respond to her residence to talk,' a Lakeland police statement said, according to Orlando Sentinel.

'According to the victim's mother, Fichter admitted to the sexual encounters and professed her love for him.'

Fichter was arrested at her Davenport home soon after the conversation, and booked at the Polk County Jail.
