'I really want to make sure that justice is done for the murder they committed,' Pabla's uncle Samir Mohan said

Judge Deborah Ryan postponed the decision until February 5, setting his bail at $100,000.

'I really want to make sure that justice is done for the murder they committed,' Pabla's uncle Samir Mohan told reporters.

'I consider this murder - racing down Yerba Buena at 100 mph.'

His words came a day after more than 100 people gathered on Yerba Buena Road, where Pabla was killed, in a candlelit vigil.

Walking along Pabla's normal jogging route, friends paid tribute to her charisma and good spirit.
