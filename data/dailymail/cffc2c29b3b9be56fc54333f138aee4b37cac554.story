A student has said she was 'fobbed off' after complaining about a receipt found in a coffee shop which described the customers as 'f*****s'.

Naomi Bloomer said the receipt was 'clearly visible to customers' on the bar at Grind Coffee Bar, at Westfield Stratford, London.

But when she complained to a member of staff she was apparently told 'Yeah, we've been rammed', it has been reported.

The receipt features the words 'f*****s all come at once' along with the list of items bought at the shop.

Ms Bloomer, a student at University College London, told the Evening Standard: 'This receipt was just sitting there on the bar, clearly visible to customers.

'I just thought it was really inappropriate and so I complained.'

The student, from Kentish Town, London, said when she initially complained to a cashier he told her: 'Yeah we've been rammed'.

Ms Bloomer said she has now complained three times to Westfield but has just been 'fobbed off and ignored'.

Dave Dickinson, owner of the coffee bar, told the Standard the chain strives for 'super-friendly' customer service and apologised to the customer.

Westfield Stratford, which had more than £9 billion spent on its regeneration, and boasts a modern transport hub, Europe’s biggest shopping mall and the vast Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, was this week revealed as the country's worst crime hotspot.

An analysis of police figures by The Mail on Sunday found the postcode covering the shopping centre is plagued by almost 200 offences every month.

Scotland Yard has recorded 3,440 crimes in the area over the past 18 months, including 500 shoplifting offences, almost 300 violent crimes and hundreds of pick-pocketings and muggings.

A spokesman for Westfield insisted the postcode covered a wider area than its shopping centre alone, and added: 'As a proportion of high customer numbers visiting our centres, the incident levels at Westfield are very low.

'The safety of our customers, retailers and residents is a key priority. Westfield has on-site police teams and works closely with the Met Police, local authorities and retailers to ensure its centres are  a safe and enjoyable place for  our customers.'
