Being paid £3,000 per month for inscribing intricate writing patterns on young female models means that at just 23-years-old this self-taught artist probably has the world's best job. 

Talented 'calligraffiti' artist Pokras Lampas, from St. Petersburg, Russia, has his models strip naked before he scribbles his calligraphy freehand on their chests, navels and legs.

The intricate designs wind around the models' bodies, covering them in the ancient writing form in a variety of colours, creating mesmerizing and unique works of art.

The intricate work means that models often have to remain still for up to five hours to create the designs 

Pokras' clients now include world-famous brands such as Nike, Mercedes-Benz and Skoda

'Sometimes girls are fully naked,' said Pokras.

'My male friends might be envious of my job sometimes, but my real mates just enjoy the work I produce and support me with help and feedback.

'My girlfriend fully understands that this is my job and knows that I am trying to be a good boy during my sessions.

'I enjoy this job, but for me sometimes really important to stay serious and execute my calligraphy perfectly.'

Unbelievably Pokras in entirely self taught, and says many models want to turn his designs into permanent tattoos 

Pokras began graffiti art when he was 16 before teaching himself calligraphy and combining the two

Pokras uses acrylic-based ink to write on the ladies' bodies in sessions that last up to five-hours.

Pokras' unusual art has become so successful that his clients include world-famous brands such as Nike, Mercedes-Benz and Skoda.

'I got started as a graffiti artist when I was just 16-years-old,' said Pokras.

'I started to teach myself calligraphy a few years after this and began to blend the two techniques together.

'People are generally impressed by my style and how it looks on my models.

'Often the models love the look so much they want calligraphy tattoos to be permanent on their necks or hands.'
