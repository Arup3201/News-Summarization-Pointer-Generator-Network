With a high collar, feathered headdress and Edwardian updo, this glamorous figure looks like a lady grand enough to rival the Dowager Countess of Grantham.

But Dame Maggie Smith need not panic. It is not a new actress joining the cast of Downton Abbey but Gary Carr, who tonight becomes the drama’s first black actor when he plays jazz singer Jack Ross.

And fans of the popular ITV show can rest easy because our exclusive photograph was taken when Carr was still at drama school.

Style swapping: Left, new cast member Gary Carr in drag as Simone Pistache in a production of Can-Can when he was a drama student and right, the Dowager Countess of Grantham played by Maggie Smith

Carr, who harbours ambitions to be a 
professional singer, agreed to dress up as a woman to land the lead role
 in a production of Cole Porter’s risque 1953 musical Can-Can.

The
 26-year-old, who studied at the London Academy Of Music And Dramatic 
Art, played Simone Pistache, the outrageous owner of a Parisan club.

Carr said: ‘I remember telling my tutors I wanted a role which would allow me to transform myself. ‘I told them to push me to the limit and throw me in at the deep end, and this is what they came up with.

'I
 had to transform myself completely so I could play a female lead and 
the madam in charge of a Moulin Rouge-type whorehouse in Paris.’

Dame Maggie Smith won’t be the only 
Downton leading lady to raise her eyebrows at Carr’s former incarnation.
 Shirley MacLaine, who plays the formidable Martha Levinson in the 
costume drama, starred as Pistache in the 1960 big-screen adaptation of 
the musical.

Tight lipped: Carr said his character would be drawn both to Lady Rose and Lady Mary but wouldn't say whether either encounter was romantic

Not shy: Carr has made quite an impression on fans since his Lion King days showing off his finely honed torso through his work

Downton Abbey’s 12 million fans will 
get their first glimpse of Carr tonight when jazz singer  Jack Ross ends
 up at Downton following a chance meeting in  a London club. Producers 
are keeping his storylines under tight wraps but last night Carr 
admitted his character would be drawn to both Lady Mary, played by 
Michelle Dockery, and the flighty Lady Rose, played by Lily James.

He
 said: ‘All I can say is that he interacts with both Lady Mary and Lady 
Rose. Whether one of the relationships is romantic and one isn’t, I 
can’t say. 

‘Both of these two characters end up 
being quite prominent in his life. He has to ask a lot of questions 
about himself as he is drawn closer to certain characters.’

Carr says Jack’s arrival raises eyebrows above and below stairs, but viewers won’t be confronted with hard-hitting racism.

He said: ‘Jack has a maturity and a self confidence, and when he enters a room he knows all eyes are on him. He is not arrogant. He is very suave and cool. But when a foreign object or character enters an environment, there are bound to be a lot of questions. Jack finds himself faced with ignorance rather than prejudice.’

Viewers are still reeling from the brutal rape of lady’s maid Anna, played by Joanne Froggatt, on last week’s episode, but Carr has only praise for the way the attack was depicted.

He said: ‘I think it was extremely well written and extremely well acted. What I love is that Downton is giving its audience an education about those particular times. It’s interesting to see how a woman would deal with rape back then. It’s not like today. She wouldn’t have lawyers or any support mechanism.’

Carr, who appeared in a West End 
production of The King And I when he was just seven years old, will 
perform all of his own numbers in the show. He is also working on an 
album of original material, which he hopes to release next year. 

Suave and cool: Carr, pictured on set as Jack Ross, says he admires his character's maturity and confidence

The actor – who has shown off his finely honed torso in plays – said: ‘I am a singer and dancer first.

That is what is really funny about life. I have always been singing and writing music, and I play the piano and the guitar.  I was born to dance and my education is every MGM musical you can think of with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. That is why I am recording music this year and looking to sign and officially release music as a singer next year. That is the career I wanted first.’

Carr says he is glad that Jack is a positive character rather than a victim.

He said: ‘I have avoided those kinds of roles. There are loads of shows where every time you see a black character they are wearing hoodies or they are gangsters. That is very tiring.’

Carr says his mum and sister are ‘crazy Downton fans’ who can’t believe he is in the show.

Unfortunately, his grandparents, Clive and Marjorie, live in Trinidad, one of the few countries where Downton isn’t shown. Clive, 80, said: ‘It would have been nice to see Gary in the show, but we will have to wait for a DVD.’
