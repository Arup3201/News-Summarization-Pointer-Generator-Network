A new mother nearly died after her C-section wound became infected with MRSA - leaving her with a 10-inch hole across her stomach.

Gemma Wilby, 30, gave birth to her son Alfie in September 2012 in a south London hospital but soon became aware she had  contracted an infection.

Despite undergoing life-saving surgery, 
having maggots placed on the wound to eat away the dead flesh and taking a cocktail of daily drugs, the MRSA could 
not be brought under control and she was warned she could die.

Lucky to be alive: Gemma Wilby, 30, gave birth to her son Alfie in September 2012 but her C-section wound became infected with MRSA. She believes the only reason she is alive today is due to copper-infused pyjamas which fought the bug, developed by family friend Amber McCleary (left)

She believes the only reason she is here today is because she wore copper-infused pyjamas which killed the infection.

When she arrived at hospital in labour, she was rushed into theatre as she was suffering from compilcations.

Ms Wilby said: 'They told me I would need an emergency C-section but I don’t
 remember much of it as I was drifting in and out of consciousness.'

Several
 hours later her son Alfie arrived, weighing 7.6lbs.

‘I
 was dizzy and exhausted after giving birth,’ said Ms Wilby. 'My C-section scar spread 10 inches from hip to hip and I was in 
excruciating pain.

'It 
hurt too much to hold Alfie but nurses gently placed him on me a few 
hours later. But I didn’t feel great, and I was kept in because my blood
 counts were abnormally high.'

But it soon became clear that Ms Wilby, who lives
 with her long-term partner Mark Minick, 31, a chef , had also contracted an infection.

Despite this, 'the hospital has never 
confirmed where the infection came from and has said there isn’t enough
 evidence to be sure,' she said.

Lifesaver: Despite undergoing life-saving surgery, having maggots placed on the wound to eat away the dead flesh and taking a cocktail of daily drugs, the MRSA could not be brought under control and Ms Wilby was warned she could die.

'They told me my scar wasn’t healing properly and I had an open 
wound, but they didn’t show me it when they changed dressings.

'I had no 
idea quite how bad things had got - although the overpowering stench of 
rotting flesh made me realise something was terribly wrong after a few 
days.

‘I felt really 
embarrassed and didn’t want my partner coming near me. On top of this, 
because I was on a cocktail of antibiotics I wasn’t allowed to 
breastfeed Alfie and I could barely hold him for longer than a few 
seconds because of the pain. It was horrible.’

On
 25 September, 20 days after giving birth, Ms Wilby was discharged 
from hospital with Alfie. At this point, she still didn’t know what the 
infection was.

But a day later, a district nurse visiting her was so 
concerned she sent her back to her GP, who told her she needed urgent 
treatment.

Ms Wilby said: 'By now, none of the antibiotics were working and the wound had doubled in 
size. My GP said to go straight back to the hospital as an emergency as 
it had all the signs of MRSA.

‘You could smell me from 10 feet away. We knew in our hearts that this wasn’t just an infection, it was more sinister.’

MRSA: At its worst, the infection left Ms Wilby with a 10-inch gaping hole. She was only discharged once it got to this stage

Too
 scared to return to the original hospital she’d been a patient at, she underwent life-saving treatment at East Surrey Hospital on October 6, 2012.

After the surgery, she was kept in 
hospital for five days while doctors monitored her recovery.

She was even given maggot therapy - where live maggots were placed 
in the open wound to eat away the dead flesh - but the infection was so 
severe the maggots died.

By this time, a family friend had heard about Ms Wilby's condition and said copper might be able to help.

Amber McCleary, 18, had spent 18 months researching 
antimicrobial fabric testing and had carried out various lab tests which 
proved bacteria couldn’t survive on copper.

With this in mind, she 
approached UK inventor Paula Ward and the pair produced a pair of copper-infused pyjamas for her friend.

Ms Wilby said: ‘Amber brought me copper PJs, 
bedding, socks and a hospital gown - and all had been lab 
proven to be anti MRSA.

'At first I was sceptical about the copper-infused PJs, but within a  a 
couple days I felt much better and noticed the open wound was 
decreasing in size.

‘It was incredible. The nurses took swabs from my stomach daily and they always came
 back infected with MRSA, but a few days after wearing the 
copper-infused clothing, they came back negative.

'They couldn’t believe 
it and thought there had been a mistake. They took another one just to 
be double check. To our amazement, it was negative! The infection was 
gone and the open wound was shrinking. We were lost for words. It was at
 that point I knew I wasn’t going to die.’

‘You
 wouldn’t think something so simple could make such a huge difference 
but I could feel the difference in my skin almost overnight. Instead of 
feeling lethargic I felt brighter, more alert and healthier. More 
importantly, I was healing. It was a miracle.’

In
 the days and weeks that followed, she ontinued to ‘live in’ her 
copper pyjamas and nurses commented on how quickly she was healing and were 
positive the nightwear was behind her speedy recovery.

Surgery: Ms Wilby underwent life-saving surgery at a different hospital, East Surrey, as doctors battled to fight the superbug ravaging her body

‘I cherished them after that,’ says Ms Wilby. ‘I wouldn’t take them off. Medics said it would take me a year to 
recover but by Christmas, less than two months later, I was back on my 
feet and feeling normal again. Copper is known for its healing powers 
and it really accelerated the process for me.’

As part of their research, Copper 
Clothing (the company formed by Ms Ward and Ms McCleary) collected a 1cm square sample of Ms Wilby's NHS gown and another 
from the copper infused material.

Both were washed at 65 degrees and 
sent away to be tested under stringent 'MRSA protocol' in a laboratory.

After
 24 hours, over 400 million superbug bacteria were picked up on the NHS 
fabric whereas the copper-infused material had no superbug bacteria.

Over the years, copper oxide has become 
an increasingly popular component in health products because of its 
natural anti-microbial and healing properties. Already, in countries 
such as Japan, hospital staff and patients wear copper-infused clothing 
as a matter of course.

Now, one year on, Croydon University Hospital is clinically
 trialling the pioneering clothing after hearing Ms Wilby's success story - 
believing it could revolutionise the NHS, who are fighting an ongoing 
battle against increasingly antibiotic resistant superbugs such as MRSA.

Pioneering: Amber Cleary spent 18 months researching antimicrobial fabric testing and had carried out various lab tests which proved bacteria couldn¿t survive on copper

Mr Abdul Sultan, Consultant Obstetrician 
and Gynaecologist at Croydon University Hospital, said: 'This clothing 
may have the potential to make a real difference to the way in which we 
treat ulcers and infection in patients, based on the research I have 
seen which was available on the subject.

'We believe that the 
laboratory-based research looked very promising and there is now a need 
for controlled clinical trials. We are in the process of setting up a 
clinical trial to establish the medical medical benefits of this clothing.'

Ms Wilby said: ‘Hospitals up and down the country should make copper-infused clothing and bedding mandatory for all staff and patients.

'I
 was so terrified I was going to die I couldn’t bond with my newborn 
baby. Every time I looked at him, I wondered if he’d soon be motherless.
 It was a horrific time and I honestly believe that I owe my life to the
 PJs.

‘If it hadn’t 
have been for them, I don’t think I’d be here today. I had maggots 
placed into my stomach to eat away the rotting flesh and surgery to cut 
away at it, but it only really improved when I started wearing the PJS. I
 wouldn’t take them off after that.’

Ms Wilby is now back working as a barmaid 
and is enjoying motherhood.

‘I don’t take anything for granted now,’ 
she says, ‘I appreciate every second with my partner and son and don’t 
worry about the small things anymore. I don’t want anybody to go through
 what I did and that’s why I’ve chosen to speak out.'
