The dictator hated visiting the dentist right up until his death

A postcard sent during the First World War by Adolf Hitler after a visit to the dentist - in which he claimed to have had 19 teeth removed - has turned up in Munich.

'You can't imagine how nice I looked,' he wrote to a fellow soldier called Karl Lanzhammer who was stationed in France. 'Now I'm better.'

The card, dated December 21, 1916, has been authenticated after it was found in the collection of a postcard collector.

On the front of the card is a picture of Berlin's Landwehr Canal and it is marked with the stamp of the 2nd Bavarian Infantry Regiment, Hitler's unit at the time.

The future FÃ¼hrer of Nazi Germany was known to hate the dentist.

Research has proved he had 15 teeth removed during his lifetime, but not all at the same time.

'The postcard is written in his handwriting and signed by him. There is not doubt that it is genuine' said Ludwig Eiber, a professor of history at the University of Augsburg.

Hitler was in Munich at the time he sent the card, recovering from a grenade splinter wound in his thigh.

It is the second card Hitler sent to Lanzhammer that has been discovered in the past two years. In 2012, one was found sent from the same hospital at the same time, December 1916, in which Hitler griped that he was restless and wanted to get back to the front lines.

Hitler, who recuperated in Munich from October 1916 until March 1917, expressed similar sentiments in the second postcard, adding after his dental report: 'Would that I could be back with you. Unfortunately there is no chance of me coming back to the front, at least not right now.'

Hitler returned to the war in 1917 and fought on until October the following year when he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and saw out the rest of the war in a hospital north of Berlin.

Lanzhammer died in March 1918 while completing training to become a pilot at Oberschleissheim near Munich.

Hitler remained terrified of going to the dentist until the day he died.

His personal dentist Johannes Blaschke revealed how Hitler once insisted simple root-canal work was spread over eight days because he 'couldn't stand the pain.'

Hitler also had 'terribly bad breath, abscesses and gum disease', according to Blaschke.
