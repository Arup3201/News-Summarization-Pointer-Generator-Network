Arrested: Devon Coley, 18, was arrested on Monday after posting a threat to police on social media 

Police have increased security at some stationhouses and made at least four arrests over threats made since the deadly shootings of two officers last weekend, and the mayor vowed on Wednesday to protect officers.

Emergency Services Unit officers and swat teams were providing additional protection at two Brooklyn precincts, where they were stationed starting Tuesday. 

Graffiti reading, 'kill the cops' lined the streets of Brooklyn as cops searched for suspects threatening police safety. 

Police said on Wednesday they were remaining vigilant while investigating the origin of the threats, which they didn't detail.

Meanwhile, an 18-year-old was facing charges of making a terroristic threat after authorities said he put up a menacing photo and message online on Saturday hours after the afternoon ambush of Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos by a gunman who had signaled his plans on social media.

Teenager Devon Coley posted a photo on his Facebook page Saturday night of a gunman shooting at a patrol car, symbols showing a gun pointed at an officer's head and a caption with his local precinct's number and '73 next,' according to a court complaint.

His lawyer, Daniel Ades, said on Wednesday that the state terroristic-threats law was being misapplied.

'Nobody's condoning threats against police,' he said, but 'even if this is proven, it doesn't amount to a crime.'

 He noted that the law requires a 'reasonable expectation or fear' that a threat meant to influence government or intimidate the public is about to be carried out.

Prosecutors sought $250,000 bail for Coley, who was already facing unrelated gun possession and other charges, the New York Post reported. Court records show a judge released him without bail on the threats charge.

Officials said they had assessed hundreds of online postings and calls to emergency lines, initiating about 40 threat probes, with about half of those being closed or referred to other agencies.

The police department said one 52-year-old man had been arrested after walking into a Manhattan stationhouse and saying: 'If I punch you in the face, how much time will I get?' and refusing to leave.

Increased threats: Police have increased security at two New York City stationhouses while investigating threats against them in the wake of the deadly shootings of two officers last weekend

Incriminating post: Devon Coley, 18, allegedly posted this photo of a man shooting police along with the caption, '73 next' indicating he was targeting the 73rd precinct 

In addition, two Staten Island residents were arrested in separate incidents on Tuesday.  A 16-year-old named Yasin Shearin was arrested on a charge of making a terrorist threat and a 46-year-old man was charged with making a false report.

Mayor Bill de Blasio denounced the various threats Wednesday and said the city 'will protect the men and women who protect us.'

'New York City stands with our police officers in this time of tragedy, as we do every day, and our city will not be intimidated by those spouting hateful, violent messages,' he said in a statement.

In Colorado, a 33-year-old military veteran was arrested Monday for posting online threats calling for the killing of current and former police officers under the name 'Vets Hunting Cops.'

And in Northern California, presidents of the three biggest Northern California police unions warned that recent anti-police sentiments are threatening officers' safety. 

Recent demonstrations against police brutality have devolved into tasteless vilification of officers, including chants calling for dead police officers, the union heads said in a letter posted online Tuesday. 

Stationed: NYPD swat team members now stationed outside 79th and 81st precinct stationhouses after alleged threats from the Baltimore based gang the Black Guerrilla Family

Police said on Wednesday they were remaining vigilant while investigating the origin of the threats.

A confidential informant told cops about rumors of a gang plot to 'shoot it out' at the station houses, reported the NY Post.

The gang member who supposedly made the threat served three years in jail for robbery and attempted murder, reports the NY Post.

Cops were varied in their opinion of  how serious the threat was to their safety.

 A senior police official told the NY Post, 'We’re investigating that threat, but at this time, it does not appear to be credible.'

President of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, Ed Mullins, seemed to think the threat was a cause for concern. 

Amping up security: A confidential informant told cops about rumors of a gang plot to 'shoot it out' at the station houses so they are increasing security accordingly 

'I’m told it’s credible,' said Mullins 

'We’ve got emergency service personnel providing additional security outside of precincts. It’s credible.'

This is the second supposed threat against police that comes from the Black Guerilla Family this month.

CBS reports that the 75th and 104th precincts in Queens also received telephone bomb threats on Tuesday but that both buildings were swept by the bomb squad and cleared. 

Earlier this month,police were instructed to wear bulletproof vests and also bring extra ammo because of a 'verified' threat that they were being targeted by the Baltimore based gang. 

On Saturday, Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed by a gunman who had posted online about his plans to attack police. Ramos and Liu worked in the 84th precinct, which is also in Brooklyn.

Early on Saturday morning, before murdering officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, Ismaaiyl Brinsley turned up unannounced at his ex-girlfriend's home in Owings Mills, Maryland and pointed a gun to his head, according to Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce.

Gunman: Brinsley killed himself after he was chased into the subway by cops following the murders

Victim: Shaneka Thompson, pictured, managed to talk her ex-boyfriend Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, out of shooting himself on Saturday but he shot her instead and went on to kill two police officers in Brooklyn

His ex, Air Force reservist Shaneka Thompson, managed to talk him out of taking his life - before he turned the gun on her instead.

After his attack on Thompson, he rode a Bolt bus to New York - as police started tracking Thompson's cellphone in a bid to follow him.

After arriving in New York City, he took the subway to Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where he dumped his ex-girlfriend's stolen cell phone.

Around this time, Baltimore County Police sent the NYPD a fax alerting them to Brinsley and his intentions - but it did not reach cops on the streets in time.

Brinsley identified his targets at Tompkins Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, then instructed passersby to watch before firing four shots at the two police officers in their car.

He then ran into the subway station but a waiting train closed its doors. With police making chase, he then shot himself dead. 

On Tuesday, uniformed cops had laid bouquets, lit candles and left toys around the street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of the city where a crazed gunman shot dead officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.

In mourning: Slain NYPD officer Wenjian Liu's wife, Pei Xia Chen, comes back from the 84th precinct and needed assistance standing and officers helped her back to her home

Ignoring requests: Despite calls from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to curb protests until after the funerals of slain NYPD officers, demonstrators took to the streets to exercise their first amendment rights

They were joined by mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, who also laid flowers at the site in a show of unity with the police force, elements of which say the mayor had turned against them before the deaths.

Wenjian Liu's wife, Pei Xia Chen, needed assistance standing as officers helped her back to her home following the news.

De Blasio later led city officials in a moment of silence at 2.47pm Monday - exactly three days after Ismaaiyl Brinsley opened fire on officers Ramos and Liu as they sat in their patrol car. 

Officers amassed at the memorial fell silent to honor their fallen comrades, as city leaders urged people around New York and the country to do the same. 

Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of New York City on Tuesday evening to condemn police brutality, ignoring calls from New York's governor, the city's mayor and others calling for restraint in the wake of recent news.

Protesters, carrying signs reading ‘Jail Killer Cops’ and 'Stop The War On Black America' marched en masse to demand justice for those who have died recently at the hands of police.

The rallies began in Union Square and outside City Hall and protesters then marched through midtown Manhattan. Some protesters chanted 'Hey-hey, ho-ho. These racist cops have got to go' and 'How do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D.' as they marched along Fifth Avenue. 

The demonstrations went on despite calls by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday for a hiatus on demonstrations until after the funerals of the two NYPD cops - Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu - murdered by Ismaaiyl Brinsley on Saturday.

Organizers ignored de Blasio's call for the march to be cancelled and said there was no reason to 'give in to hysteria' and call off the event.

At first, marchers stayed on the sidewalks as a large police presence, with officers - some wearing riot helmets and face shields - keeping protesters from impeding holiday traffic.
