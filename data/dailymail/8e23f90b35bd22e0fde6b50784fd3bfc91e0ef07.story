Manchester United manager David Moyes has responded to Jose Mourinho’s latest comments about Wayne Rooney by underlying that the England striker is not for sale.

Moyes had his first press conference of the club’s tour of Asia and Australia at Bangkok’s Rajamangala Stadium on Friday afternoon ahead of his first game as the club’s manager, against Singha All Stars on Saturday.

Predictably, he was hit by a barrage of questions over Rooney, who has returned home from tour already with a hamstring problem.

Direct approach: Jose Mourinho has admitted he likes Wayne Rooney 'very much'

Earlier in the day, Chelsea manager 
Mourinho spoke about his admiration for Rooney, the second time he has 
done this since returning to Stamford Bridge in the summer.

Asked about this, Moyes said: 'Unless I was speaking double Dutch last week, we said Wayne Rooney is not for sale.

'People are entitled to talk about good players. I'm getting asked plenty of questions about Wayne.

'Jose has been asked about players as 
well. It's hard to keep repeating myself but I will - Wayne is a 
Manchester United player and it will remain that way.

'I think Jose said, in his comments, that he doesn't normally talk about other players. But it does happen.

'I think I've covered all of the things on Wayne. I've given you everything about his injury.

'What you must remember is that 
Manchester United is a football club and I've got a team, and this is 
not about any one individual.

'I many ways, I'm only interested in 
the team. I will answer questions on Wayne but some of them are just 
reverting back to things I've covered.'

Sent home: Wayne Rooney has left United's tour of Thailand with a hamstring injury

Chelsea are thought to be among those 
interested in taking Rooney with the striker yet to commit his future to
United and now Mourinho has insisted he is a player he 'likes very 
much'.

'It’s a funny trick question,' Mourinho said.

'From an ethical point of view I can 
not speak about other team’s players. But I won’t speak with hypocrisy. 
It’s not in my nature. I always speak what I think.

'He
is a player I like very much but I can’t say much more. He is fast and 
direct and I like him. But he is a Manchester United player.'

Rooney signed for United in 2004, the same summer Mourinho arrived at Chelsea.

The Portuguese manager left Stamford Bridge in 2007, however, only returning this summer, but he believes the club have appointed a better boss second time around.

'I am better now,' he said. 'Experience matters a lot and age and my years around Europe – two years in Italy and three in Spain – makes me better coach. I am in better condition than I was last time.

'I have some white hairs but in my case 
that’s a good sign. It means I am better now than before. I am still 
very sad and unhappy when my team doesn’t win, it's up to the players to
help me get the results that I want and I need.

'This means much more 
than a football club. Its more than being a professional. It means a 
lot.'

In the shade? Mourinho's rarely known for taking a back seat

Rooney is already back in Manchester 
after United’s medical staff assessed an injury he actually picked up 
before he left. The good news is that Moyes now believes he may be back 
in action in three weeks, in time for the start of the season.

'It's a blow that we've lost him because he's been training well and looking very good,' said Moyes.

'But unfortunately he just felt something in his hamstring.

'We did a check and found a slight grade one injury there, which will probably keep him out for about two to three weeks.

'So I don't foresee any problem with Wayne starting the season and being fit for then.

'He didn't train the last little bit 
before we ca,e. He just felt his hamstring tighten, so we pulled him out
and didn't think anything of it.

'It was only when we got here we knew 
we weren't going to train him yesterday, and we thought, as a 
precaution, we would check it out.

'When we went to check it we saw a 
small grade one [tear]. We could maybe have taken him on to all the 
other places, but he couldn't have played the games.

'So for the benefit of the player the best thing to do was to get him home straight away and quickly into his rehabilitation.

'Remember, when we return from this 
tour we've still got games in Stockholm, Rio's testimonial and the 
Community Shield, so he can play in those games.

'It's important we get players fit for those games.

'We didn't expect it. But what would be the point in taking any risks? There's no point in taking any risks.

'We'll keep his work up. With hamstring injuries, you can do work in the pool, you can do work in the gym.'
