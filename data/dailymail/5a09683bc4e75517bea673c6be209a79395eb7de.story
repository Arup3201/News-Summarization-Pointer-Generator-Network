Sir Lawrie Barratt, who made affordable home ownership a reality for millions with his nationwide housing developments has died at the age of 85.

Sir Lawrie, who died yesterday at his home in Corbridge, Northumberland, was responsible for important innovations in the way houses were built and marketed.

The grandfather, who was threatened by armed robbers alongside wife Lady
 Sheila at their home two years ago, had suffered an 
illness before his death.

Sir Lawrie joined Greensitt Bros, run by Lewis Greensitt in 1958.

The Company eventually became Greensitt and Barratt  in early 1960's and the company was floated on the Stock Exchange in 1968 as Greensitt and Barratt, with Lewis Greensitt and Lawrie Barratt at the helm.

In 1963 the company was renamed Barratt Developments and the firm now employs more than 4,000 people and has 25 divisions across Britain.

Sir Lawrie had a talent for giving customers what they wanted and getting the details spot-on, coming up with the concept of fitted kitchens and with clever ways to maximise space.

As well as changing the way homes were built, he also affected how they were sold, pioneering the concept of part-exchange, which made ownership a reality for families from all walks of life.

His marketing ideas were also inspired, with the company's iconic 1970s helicopter TV adverts promoting £7,000 starter homes becoming some of the most memorable of all time.

Right to buy: Sir Lawrie was knighted in 1982, after the firm became famous for designing and building high-quality, affordable homes

After leaving school at just 14, Sir Lawrie trained as an accountant and went to work for a legal firm.

He built his first home just outside Newcastle in the mid-1950s, because he could not afford the house he wanted.

In 1958, he established Greensitt Bros with  partner Lewis Greensitt, and it was renamed Barratt Developments in 1963, a year after he took control. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1968.

The company quickly became one of the largest and best-known house builders in the UK, and Sir Lawrie was knighted in 1982.

In 1953, 25-year-old Barratt built a four-bedroom home at Darras Hall, near Newcastle upon Tyne, for £1,750.

He then purchased a plot across the road and built two more semis, selling them for a profit.In 1958, he joined Greensitt Bros, run by Lewis Greensitt, and it was renamed Barratt Developments in 1963, a year after he took control.

The company, which is today worth in excess of £2bn, was floated on the Stock Exchange in 1968, with Greensitt leaving shortly after the flotation.

The firm quickly became the biggest 
house-builder in the UK, and within 30 years, Sir Lawrie had gone from 
owning a single house to building 10,000-15,000 a year across the UK.

In 1983, the firm sold a record 16,500 houses and became the nation’s largest housebuilder. 

In 1985, the Thatchers bought a Barratt home for £400,000 and Sir Lawrie comes out of retirement briefly in 1991 to save the company after £106m losses.

Barratt Developments now employs more than 4,000 people in 25 divisions across the UK.

He retired from his roles as chairman and chief executive in 1988 but was called out of retirement in 1991 to become chairman again and restore the business's ailing fortunes, finally retiring for good in 1997.

He remained Life President and a significant shareholder in the Company.

Just two years ago, the entrepreneur and his wife, Lady Sheila, suffered a harrowing experience when they were tied up in their home by three masked men.

The raiders, who were armed with crowbars, bound and gagged the couple before stealing a hoard of expensive jewellery.

Their loot included a 338-stone necklace, matching bracelet and earrings and a 35-stone ruby and diamond cluster ring.

Mark Clare, chief executive of Barratt Developments, said: 'Sir Lawrie founded the company in 1958 and established it as the largest and best-known house-builder in the country.

'He had the vision to understand how deeply rooted the desire for home ownership is within this country and he then set out to meet that aspiration by designing and building high-quality, affordable homes.

'Under his leadership, the company brought home ownership within reach of many people through innovative support for home-buyers and the high-profile way it was promoted.

'I believe that it is no exaggeration to say that there are hundreds of thousands of people in the UK today, across every walk of life, that have bought or lived in homes inspired by Sir Lawrie.'

Pioneer: Sir Barratt changed the way homes were built, marrying high quality with affordability through innovative schemes

North East Chamber of Commerce chief executive James Ramsbotham told the Newcastle Journal: 'Sir Lawrie was a well- respected and much-admired member of the North East business community and a pioneer in his field.

'My thoughts are with his family and friends on this very sad day.'

Sir Lawrie and Lady Barratt's granddaughter Fiona is married to the former England player Sol Campbell and their son Peter Barratt opened a series of garden centres.

Sir Lawrie was also heavily involved in charity work and helped to raise money for Red Cross by opening up the couple’s gardens to the public each year.

This year Barratt won the Housebuilder og the Year award. Judges called the company an 'outstanding all-rounder, showing its prowess in the fields of zero carbon, regeneration, design and landscaping'.

Meteoric rise: Jjust ten years after its launch in 1958, the company was listed on the London Stock Exchange. It remains one of the largest house builders in the UK
