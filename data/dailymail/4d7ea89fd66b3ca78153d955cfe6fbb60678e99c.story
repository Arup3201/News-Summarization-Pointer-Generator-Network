Kris Boyd will only rejoin Rangers if the Ibrox club match the personal terms on offer elsewhere.

Dundee United, Aberdeen and French side Nimes have all tabled concrete offers for the 30-year-old free agent.

Boyd’s preference, however, is to return to Ibrox after a four-year absence and a deal could be struck to in the coming days provided his former employer can up the offer they made him late last week.

The former Kilmarnock man looked to be heading to Tannadice a week ago after Rangers stalled on a deal.

The Ibrox club belatedly re-entered the race for his signature over the weekend but, as things stand, that deal will need to be improved upon in order to reunite him with Kenny Miller.

Boyd became the SPL’s top scorer with 167 strikes after joining his boyhood heroes from Kilmarnock in 2006.

He left to join Middlesbrough in 2010, then had spells at Nottingham Forest, Eskisehirspor in Turkey and Portland Timbers in the MLS before returning to Rugby Park in February.

Boyd’s goals helped keep Killie in the Premiership and now it looks like his partnership with Miller will for the basis of Rangers’ push for promotion.

Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes has all but conceded defeat in the battle to land the striker.

‘I think if Rangers make Kris Boyd an offer then financially it would beat our offer,’ he said.

‘If it isn’t Kris Boyd, then we move on. If Kris decides he wants to come to Aberdeen, then we will do a deal but we can’t stand about waiting for that to happen.

‘We still have other options to look at as well.’
