Despite being someone who has won the championship eight times, Rafael Nadal has never enjoyed an unconditional love affair with the French Open or the Roland Garros public.

On Monday, returning yet again to begin the defence of his title, he will find himself taking his bow on the secondary Court Suzanne Lenglen, with Novak Djokovic and Australian Open champion Stanislaw Wawrinka playing their matches on the main Court Philippe Chatrier.

The indications last night were that the Nadal camp were none too impressed with the undisputed king of clay being treated in such a manner.

Back to his best? Rafa Nadal, watched by uncle Toni, practices at Roland Garros before his title defence

Unloved: While Nadal attracts the admiration of the French crowd he has never been completely accepted

His public relations manager Benito Perez Barbadillo gave an obvious clue to how the world number one was thinking when he tweeted: '3rd in Suzanne Lenglen tomorrow. What do you think?'

While there is no unshakeable convention here as at Wimbledon that a returning men’s champion gets to kick off at an appointed hour on the equivalent of Centre Court, and it is not the end of the tennis world, some irritation is understandable.

It is not that Djokovic or Wawrinka have especially juicy opponents – although the latter needs to watch out against Guillermo Garcia Lopez – and women’s champion Serena Williams was put on Chatrier on Sunday.

Nadal will have to wait his turn to tackle American Robby Ginepri and it will add to the sense that not everyone would be unhappy if someone else won this year. All sport needs unpredictability and through his sustained brilliance on clay the Spaniard has sometimes turned this into a procession.

For that reason the Parisian crowd could hardly hide their delight in 2009 when he lost at this event to Robin Soderling, having been booed off court when he retired injured in late 2008 at the indoor Paris Masters that happens each November.

His uncle and coach Toni Nadal did not attempt to conceal his fury five years ago, calling them ‘stupid’, among other things. The way of tennis crowds is often only to love a player when they are on the downslide.

Today’s scheduling may add to the determination of his nephew to prove the doubters wrong over the next fortnight as, for the first time since the middle of the last decade, he comes here as many people’s second favourite.

Made to wait: The defending champion will not being his campaign until after late on Monday

Strong: Federer breezed through his first round match against Lukas Lacko and says Nadal is still the man to beat

The world number one has lost three times on clay this year and looked well beaten in the recent Madrid final before Kei Nishikori succumbed to a back injury.

He has talked of losing some of his ‘inside power’ and theories have abounded about the relative slippage in his results.

Some believe it to be a minor loss of confidence while in a recent interview with the New York Times, former Spanish Davis Cup Captain Emilio Sanchez suggested his footwork on the backhand may have marginally changed to protect his left knee.

It was hard to agree with Roger Federer – a comfortable opening day winner over Luckas Lacko in straight sets – that Nadal is ‘probably where he wants to be’ after losing to Djokovic in the Italian Open final.

Betting against Nadal in this event may well be foolhardy, although the bookies now make the Serb the marginal favourite for the title. Federer became unusually tetchy when asked if he considered the Spaniard was less fancied than Djokovic.

Favourite: Novak Djokovic goes into the tournament as favourite after beating Nadal in Rome last week

'I don’t know who is saying it, I definitely didn’t. It doesn’t go week to week, you know. Three weeks ago Novak couldn’t play tennis anymore (a reference to his brief wrist injury). When he was injured it was ‘Everything is terrible, oh my God’, now everything is great.

'Rafa has played the matches he needs to play. He is the favourite, then Novak and then the rest. It’s very clear.'

Few are rating Andy Murray’s chances especially highly, and he will have to wait until Tuesday to play his first round, against Kazakhstan’s Andrey Golubev. Heather Watson also plays then.

Of the three British players in the singles qualifier James Ward joins the fray on Monday lunchtime after being slotted into the draw against the number seventeen seed Tommy Robredo.

It is not much of a reward for coming through the qualifying, neither a glamour tie nor against an especially vulnerable opponent. Robredo is a hugely tough and consistent competitor who rarely loses to players ranked much below him, and it will require a career-best performance from world number 170 Ward to topple him.

But the British number three is in good form and has nothing to lose, playing with house money
