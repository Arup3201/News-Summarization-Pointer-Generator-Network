The Islamic State terrorist known as 'Jihadi John' was expelled from Tanzania for being drunk and disorderly on a flight from Amsterdam, the Times has reported.

In May 2009, Mohammed Emwazi reportedly indulged in a ten-hour drinking binge to the country en route to Somalia.

It conflicts with earlier reports which claimed the 26-year-old was kicked out of the capital Dar es Salaam after the country's authorities were tipped off by MI6.

The man who found infamy by fronting a string of brutal execution videos was allegedly traveling with two companions believed to be hellbent on waging jihad.

Detained: The trio landed at Dar es Salaam airport at 10.50am on May 22, 2009 and after being detained on arrival, they were formally booked into the airport's police station at 1am

Jerome Starkey also reports he was traveling to the Tanzanian capital with Ali Adorus, another suspect known to British intelligence services after he was jailed in Ethiopia for terrorism offences.

20 at the time, Emwazi was the youngest of three travel companions made up of Adorus, 27, and a German man from Tanzania known as Marcel Schrodl, 23, who told police he was a translator.

The London-born executioner later told the prisoners' rights group Cage he was traveling to Africa to go on Safari. 

They traveled at a time when Tanzania's borders were easily crossed by jihadists who wanted to join the terror group al-Shabaab, the Times reports.

The pilot of the KLM flight they were on warned immigration staff at the airport the trio were causing trouble, the country's home affairs minister has said.

It landed at 10.50am on May 22, 2009 and after being detained on arrival, they were formally booked into the airport's police station at 1am.

Mr Chikawe claimed MI6 had no role in their expulsion from the country -  insisting that the men were expelled at 8am that same morning for drunkenness.

He said: 'They were refused entry because they disembarked from the plane very drunk.' 

'They were insulting our immigration staff and other people. They failed to explain why they had come to Tanzania.'

Tip-off: The pilot reportedly phoned ahead to inform the airport's security staff of their behaviour 

Deported: They were held for questioning in the airport in Tanzania and put on a flight back to Europe at 8am the next morning

He added that other passengers on the flight which made a scheduled stop at Kilimanjaro airport confirmed the men were causing problems in the air. 

'The immigration department put them in custody on advice from the pilot that he would not carry them back to Amsterdam,' he said.

'There was no information from anywhere that they were criminal suspects.'

Previous reports have suggested that British authorities tipped off security officers in Dar es Salaam because they believed they were trying to join militants al-Shabaab.

After being kicked out of Tanzania, the men were questioned in Amesterdam and Dover and later complained about their treatment to Cage.

Adorus - whose wife lives in north-London with their child - has since been imprisoned in Ethiopia on terror-related offences.

Warning: The pilot on the KLM filight from Amsterdam phoned the security officials in Dar es Salaam to warn them about the trio who had been causing trouble

The British man who claimed to be visiting family in the African nation was sentenced to four and a half years in January.

But Cage - which has denied accusations that it sympathising with extremists -  says he signed a 'false confession' under torture.

It petitioned then-foreign secretary William Hague expressing concern about the conditions Adorus was being held under.

The immigration officer who was on duty that night did not mention drunkenness but said officers were suspicious when the men 'had some queries about their visa forms', Starkey writes.

He said: 'Before the passport scan you have to fill out a form. They had some queries about that form and, when we pressed them hard, Emwazi and his colleagues could not respond to our questions, so we took them to the airport police.'

A Tanzanian intelligence official said 'there was no stop order' from British intelligence and officials at Interpol also confirmed they had no records of an alert for Emwazi.

Now 26, he is known globally as the man who beheaded a number of ISIS hostages including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff - and Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.

In a ­series of emails sent to activists at Cage, Emwazi claimed that he was beaten and abused in Tanzanian custody. 

A Cage statement said: 'The men were threatened with beatings and held for days in inhumane conditions, only to be told that MI5 was behind their rejection from the country.'
