The closest Amir Khan and Devon Alexander came to trash talking as they met face-to-face prior to their big Saturday night fight was to act like stand-up comics.

Although the prize for the victor may well be a mega-bucks fight with Floyd Mayweather, both men still found time for humour.

Alexander tickled Khan's ribs by telling the final media conference: 'I want to say hello to all my fans in the United Kingdom who are rooting for me. It seems they want me to win, so Amir, what's going on over there?'

The St Louis-born fighter was in a humourous mood, paying tribute to his many fans in the UK

Oscar De La Hoya’s Golden Boy promotions, who represent both fighters, would reportedly prefer Khan to win

To which Khan responded: 'I need to say hello to all my fans in St Louis. I've got a lot of followers there and they're always asking me to go down to your town.'

Each fighter referred the other to his record of taking on some of the world's leading boxers and both promised to put on 'a fun show' for the crowd at the MGM Grand Garden Arena and television viewers around the world.

Alexander even insisted that coming to Vegas this week is a holiday, saying: 'Being here and fighting Amir is like a vacation for me.'

Khan took that as a reference to the three defeats he has suffered in his career so far and said: 'I've learned from those and there will be no more mistakes. I'm going to enjoy a fight of speed, explosion and power.'

Then he spoke for both him and his opponent, who are each claiming to be in the best condition of their lives when he said: 'So no excuses.'

Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late this Saturday night
