A huge chunk of the largest holiday camp ever constructed by the Nazis has been sold for £2.2million.

Block One of the Colossus of Prora - built by Hitler in the 1930s along the lines of Butlins in the UK - will be converted into a 400-bed luxury hotel and 400 apartments.

The building, the single-biggest sold in post-war Germany, had a reserve price of £700,000, but telephone bidding at a Berlin auction on Saturday sent the price soaring.

Vast: A section of the Colossus of Prora, which spans nearly three miles along the coast of the Baltic island of Ruegen, has sold for £2.2million at an auction in Berlin

Derelict: The camp was intended to provide entertainment for 20,000 Nazi holidaymakers at any one time, but no-one ever stayed there and it fell into serious disrepair

Prora was constructed on the Baltic island of Ruegen by the stormtroopers of the Nazi 'Strength Through Joy' leisure organisation over a six-year period and occupies nearly three miles of beachfront.

It was meant to provide holiday entertainment for 20,000 of Hitler's hordes at any one time. But not a single Nazi ever got to stay there.

The last rooms of the 'Butlins-of-the-dark-side' were finished just as World War Two began in 1939 and Prora was left empty, the greatest white elephant of all time.

It was occupied after 1945 by the Red Army and became a top-secret Soviet base.

White elephant: The Colossus of Prora was built in the same vein as Butlins (above) in the UK, but it didn't even get off the ground as the outbreak of World War Two and subsequent defeat of Hitler left it empty

After German reunification, all the buildings were given listed status and a very few have been transformed into holiday flats.

Monitored enjoyment: Hitler viewed leisure as yet another aspect of human activity to be governed by the Nazis

After the auction on Saturday, it is 
hoped that investment in the remaining miles of accommodation will rise 
until all are given a makeover.

Initial fears that neo-Nazis would buy into the blocks have proved unfounded.

So far, there are a few luxury flats and a youth hostel in the buildings at the site 120 miles from Berlin.

Block One is nearly 1,200ft long and auctioneer Mark Karhausen juggled bids from least ten developers.

Nearly £5million has to date been raised for the government in sales of parts of the Prora complex.

After the war, the Soviets considered blowing it up, but discovered they didn't have enough dynamite for the job.

Instead they turned it into a massive tank-and-artillery base for the Peoples' Army of East Germany and it vanished from all maps.

A museum at the site chronicles the history of Prora which, aside from the building of the Atlantic Wall of coastal fortifications stretching from Norway to the border of Spain - intended to thwart any Allied landings in occupied Europe - was Hitler's biggest building project.

The Nazis viewed leisure as just one more aspect of human activity to be governed by the party.

Prora was destined to be the forerunner of a string of such giant camps whose plans were mothballed due to the war he unleashed on the world.
