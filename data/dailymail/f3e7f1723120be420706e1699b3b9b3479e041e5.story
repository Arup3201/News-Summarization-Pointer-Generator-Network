A 20-year-old Temple University student is 'claiming' to be Conan O'Brien's illegitimate son in a hilarious viral video in which he asks the talk show host for tuition money.

Verona, New Jersey native Greg Keating posted the video to YouTube last week, revealing the fact that his mother worked three floors above the Late Night studios when he was conceived and she was mysteriously fired from her job after getting pregnant.

Keating goes on to say he wants to 'dominate late night television' with Conan as father and son while demonstrating his 'inherited' string-dancing skills.

Keating signs off with a call for child support.

'What I'm trying to say Conan is that we need each other,' Keating says. 'You need the warm embrace of your son and I need an easier financial path through college. So I love you, dad.'

Sources told the Daily Caller that the video was not a prank by Conan himself, who has since responded to the paternity rumors on twitter.

Ronan Farrow is the daughter of Mia Farrow and estranged filmmaker-ex Woody Allen. Farrow became the center of his own parenting rumors earlier this year when a Vanity Fair article alleged that he could be the son of Frank Sinatra. Farrow took Conan's joke in good humor, and retweeted it.

While the video comes off as a ploy to get on his look-a-like's show, Keating wouldn't outright deny the possibility of Conan being his father when he gave an interview to Yahoo! today.

He says he finally made the video after getting comments nearly every time he left the house, with many people saying he should film something to send to the show.

'You start to think and you start to wonder, is it more than I just look like him? Is there something else to this? Is there substance to this connection?' Keating told the website.

Keating says the comparisons started in the third-grade, before he even knew who the TV host was.

'A basketball ref called me Conan in a recreational basketball game, and I had no idea what he was talking about,' Keating said.

As he's grown older, Keating says he's grown to look more and more like Conan.

In the video he flashes a picture of his real 'father' - an image that doesn't correspond to his dad's profile on Facebook.

Jim Keating seemed to think the whole thing was hilarious, posting an article about the video saying: 'Don't know where this leaves me...'

Keating says his family has been getting a kick out of the video and all the attention it's spurned.

'People in my family are just eating it up,' he said. 'They've been waiting for me to do something about it forever. I like to make people laugh.'

While he may not be Conan's actual son, Keating says he comes from a large Irish-Catholic family from Massachusetts just like Conan, opening up the possibility that they could be distant cousins.
