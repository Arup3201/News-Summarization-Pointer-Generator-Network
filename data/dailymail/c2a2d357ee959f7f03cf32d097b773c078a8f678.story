Milton Keynes Dons' talented midfielder Dele Alli continued his impressive run of form by scoring a hat-trick against Crewe Alexandra.

The 18-year-old, who was named Football League Player of the Month for August, scored half of his team's goals as The Dons hammered Crewe 6-1 in their League One clash.

Will Grigg, Ben Reeves and on-loan Arsenal striker Benik Afobe scored the home side's other goals while a Kyle McFadzean own goal provided some consolation for Crewe.

Alli, who is capped at Under 17, 18 and 19 for England, has been attracting attention from across Europe with a list of admirers that includes Bayern Munich and Liverpool.

The midfielder, who can play behind the striker or in a deeper role, has enjoyed a meteoric rise to success this season under the guidance of Karl Robinson. 

And Alli's development at MK Dons was rewarded last week when he was given a contract extension until 2017.

With plenty of admirers further up the league, it seems unlikely that Stadium MK will be his home for the duration, though. 

Brendan Rodgers is one manager keen on aquiring Alli's services, and the player is well aware of the interest.

'Before games, the gaffer will sit me down, tell me I'm being watched, and make sure I'm not getting carried away,' Alli told The Telegraph.

'I've heard he (Brendan Rodgers) has (been watching). It's not something I really worry about.'
