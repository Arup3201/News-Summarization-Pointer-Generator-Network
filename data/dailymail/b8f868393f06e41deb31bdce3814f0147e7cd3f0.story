The world's oldest dad has been left devastated after his wife left him - just days before his youngest son's first birthday.

Ramajit Raghav hit the headlines in 2010 when he claimed to be the oldest man in the world to father a child. Incredibly he then went on to father a second child last year.

But now, at the age of 97, his wife Shakuntala Devi, who is believed to be in her early 50s, has deserted the nonagenarian and taken along son, Ranjeet, who is set to celebrate his first birthday on October 5.

Split: World's oldest dad Ramjeet Raghav says he is devastated after his wife 
Shankuntala left him just a few days before their son's first birthday

Shaken Raghav said: 'Last year, around this time, we were so happy. Ranjeet was born. I felt blessed.

'This year, all I have is my loneliness and the company of the four walls of my house.'

It is the latest bad news to strike the pensioner, who lives in a single room tenement in Haryana, northern India.

Despite
 the joy of fathering his first child, Bikramjeet, in 2010 and his 
second son, Ranjeet, last October, he has since been hit by the 
dissapearance of his eldest.

Six months ago, Shakuntala took their
 elder son Bikramjeet for a check-up at the local hospital, but she says
 she fell asleep at the bus stop on the way home. When she woke up, 
Bikramjeet was missing.

this year

Mr Raghav
 says the stress of the situation had begun to take its toll on the 
pair's relationship as they desperately tried in vain to search for 
their child.

He said: 'We could 
never find him after he went missing. We went from pillar to post in 
search of our son. But we got nothing'.

'When Bikramjeet went missing, I was devastated. But without my wife I feel so helpless. I think my world has come to an end.'

Mr Raghav had last year said the arrival of second son was a 'God's gift'.

Now living in in a single room tenement, he said he has lodged his wife and son's missing report with local government officials.

'She just left last week. She did not say anything. She just walked out of the door with Ranjeet in her arms. I don't know where they are or why she left me,' he claimed.

'I met Shakuntala on a rainy morning while sitting next to a Muslim shrine and brought her home. She didn't have any family or friends around. She was all that I had in life.'

During an interview last year, Shakuntala said she would've been dead by now if it wasn't for Ramajit's caring ways.

'It doesn't matter how old he is, I love him and I care for him dearly even though he shouts at me sometimes.

'He doesn't seem old to me, he can make love like any 25-year-old man, even better because he can go on all night, and he makes a wonderful father,' Shakuntala had said.

Raghav, a landless labourer who lives on a government pension of Rs 650 (£6.50 a month), first married at the age of 24. But after being widowed for 25 years, he married Shakuntala.

'Shakuntala and I have been together for 23 years,' Raghav recalls.

'But 23 years later, she seems to have chosen her path. All I can do it is wait for her to return.

'I sit by the door most of the time. I think she will return soon. I am waiting. I love her and I know she loves me,' he says with a sigh.
