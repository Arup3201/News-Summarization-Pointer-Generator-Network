Former X Factor contestant Simone Battle was struggling with financial problems when she took her life, according to reports.

The 25-year-old G.R.L. singer was found hanged in the closet of her West Hollywood apartment on Friday morning. The Los Angeles county coroner ruled her death a suicide.

Friends and family have told authorities that Battle had been 'depressed over money issues', TMZ reported on Tuesday.

The family said they didn't understand her money struggles because she was enjoying success with the girl group, including a collaboration with Pitbull, and had just finished a tour overseas. The group also performed on ABC's 'Good Morning America' last month.

The family also reportedly told police that Battle had been worried she would never make it big.

Battle, who was a finalist on the X Factor in 2011, was last seen alive at 3.45am on Friday - about four hours before her body was found, according to Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter.

Her father Anthony Battle, who found her body, said his daughter had never showed any sign of depression, and said that they texted every day. 

'She will be greatly missed and loved,' her father told MailOnline. 'She was an exuberant person and a very loved person.'

Battle first started singing professionally after her breakout on the U.S. version of the X Factor in 2011. She made it to the top 17 and was mentored by judge Simon Cowell. 

At the time of her death, Battle was in the girl group G.R.L., which was initially organized as a re-boot of The Pussycat Dolls. But they decided to go by a new name.

The remaining members issued a statement about her death on Saturday via Twitter. 

'Words cannot express the depth of our loss,' they wrote. 'Simone's incredible talent was only surpassed by the size of her heart. We will carry her memory with us in everything we do.'  

Battle's record company and management issued a joint statement on her passing.
