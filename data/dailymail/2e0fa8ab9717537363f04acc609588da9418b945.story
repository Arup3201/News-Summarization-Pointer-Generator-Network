Lewis Hamilton has called a truce in his uneasy relations with his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, though the circumstances surrounding how and when he tweeted the news are fishy.

Late on Friday afternoon Hamilton purportedly told his Twitter followers: 'We've been friends a long time. As friends we have our ups and downs. Today we spoke. We're cool and still friends.'

The timing was mysterious as only a few hours earlier a Mercedes spokesman had told Sportsmail that he thought Hamilton was in the air, travelling to North America ahead of the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal on June 8.

The tweet also came soon after Sky had
 flagged up on Twitter that they wanted viewers to join in their debate 
on the Hamilton-Rosberg relationship, which was pulled apart when the 
German controversially beat him to pole position in Monaco last week.

Hamilton believed Rosberg deliberately drove down an escape route to bring out yellow flags that thwarted his final flying lap.

Sky
 tweeted: 'On tonight's F1 Show, we want your views on the growing 
rivalry between Hamilton and Rosberg.'

That was at 4.22pm. Hamilton's 
tweet came 11 minutes later - and an hour and a half after Sportsmail 
specifically enquired whether Hamilton and Rosberg had spoken.

Challenged
 about the timing of Hamilton's tweet, which carried a well-chosen 
picture of the two drivers larking about on bikes as boys, Mercedes said
 he sent the text of his volition for no more intriguing a reason than 
what it said reflected the up-to-date situation.

That
 is certainly the case. However, Mercedes are acutely aware of the 
dangers and opportunities presented by Twitter in setting the news 
agenda.

They now say Hamilton will fly over the weekend.
