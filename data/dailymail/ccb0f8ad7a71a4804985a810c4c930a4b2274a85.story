'Profoundly disturbed': Angela Merkel's response to a survey showing over half of Germans want out of the euro

Angela Merkel was last night said to be ‘profoundly disturbed’ after a poll showed that a majority of Germans want to ditch the struggling euro.

Sources in Berlin said the German chancellor was shocked by the evidence of growing Euroscepticism in her country, at a time when Germany is under huge pressure to bankroll a rescue of the single currency.

The poll in a German newspaper found that 51 per cent of Germans think the country should return to the deutschmark.

It is the first poll to show that more want to leave the euro than stay in it.

Only 29 per cent thought Germany would be better off staying inside the 17-strong eurozone.

The survey also found that 71 per cent of Germans now believe Greece should be booted out of the single currency unless it acts on promises to tackle its huge debts.

Mrs Merkel’s spokesman said she was ‘profoundly disturbed’ by the poll results.

Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the Eurogroup organisation of eurozone finance ministers, last night risked further inflaming opinion in Germany by suggesting Berlin was treating the eurozone ‘as its subsidiary’ and taking decisions solely in its own national interest. ‘Why is it like this?’ he asked.

Mr Juncker, who is Luxembourg’s prime minister, said there was ‘no more time to lose’ in saving the single currency – prompting fresh speculation that the European Central Bank is poised to ease the pressure on Spain and Italy by intervening in the markets to cut their borrowing costs.

He said Germany now had to accept some
 form of ‘debt pooling’ across the eurozone – a move that has been 
bitterly resisted in Berlin.

The former prime minister said it was ‘not surprising’ that Germans are reluctant to pour more money into supporting the euro.

But he insisted that continuing to 
allow market confidence to drain from the euro is worse because it is 
pushing up the cost of rescuing the single currency.

However, the growing Euroscepticism in
 Germany limits Mrs Merkel’s room for manoeuvre, particularly with 
national elections due next year.

Economy minister Phillipp Rosler 
seized on the poll results, saying there were ‘considerable doubts about
 whether Greece is living up to its reform promises’.

In a sign of growing global concern 
about the euro crisis, US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner flew to 
Germany for talks with German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble and ECB
 chief Mario Draghi yesterday.
