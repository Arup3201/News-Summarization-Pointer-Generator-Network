This dramatic footage shows a gang of axe-wielding raiders executing a daytime smash and grab raid at a jewellers.

Dressed in blue boiler suits and black balaclavas at least two members of the gang can clearly be seen attacking the shop window with axes while the others push in the protective glass, before escaping with number of watches.

As an alarm sounds in the background one bemused shopper can be spotted milling near the four-man gang as they struck Lister Horsfall jewellers in Ilkley, West Yorkshire at lunchtime on Thursday.

According to a witness, at one point one of the thieves used an axe to threaten a police officer who approached the scene.

The gang then sped off in a silver Honda Civic, which had been driven on to the pavement in front of the jewellers, narrowly missing a car and pedestrians.

The getaway car, which was driven by a fifth gang member, was quickly abandoned and set alight in a nearby street.

Lister Horsfallâ€™s managing director Nicholas Horsfall praised the actions of his staff who stopped the robbers escaping with a big haul by activating the security shutters.

He said: 'I donâ€™t think they managed to get away with a lot.

'The quick thinking of the staff managed to avert a major loss. The shutters went down, the blinds went down and they were stripping the stock from behind the window to stop it being taken.'

He said the staff on duty were uninjured but were shaken by the incident.

It is the third time in two years the jewellers has been targetted by armed robbers - it was previously raided in June 2012 and September 2011.

A West Yorkshire police spokesman said robbers took 'a number of watches' before making off.

He has urged anyone who saw something suspicious before or after the robbery to contact police on the non-emergency number 101.
