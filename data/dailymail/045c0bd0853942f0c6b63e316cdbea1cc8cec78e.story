All smiles: Actor Daniel Radcliffe, pictured earlier this month, has made £6million this year

Daniel Radcliffe has cause to celebrate this Christmas as it is revealed he made a £6million profit this year.

The company that manages his assets, including all Potter-related earnings, is now worth a spell-binding £54,079,238.

The accounts for 24-year-old actor's firm Gilmore Jacobs proves that the Harry Potter star holds firm his spot as Britain's top earning young actor.

Last year, Gilmore Jacobs, which also 
manages Radcliffe's stateside properties, was worth £47.9min 2012, an 
increase of nearly £17m on the previous year.

As the accounts are for a small business, they do not disclose how much the Hollywood star paid himself personally in dividends.

Gilmore
 Jacobs was set up in 2000 by Radcliffe’s father Alan, a literary agent,
 and his mother Marcia, to safeguard his earnings from the hit films.

Assets
 include two subsidiary property companies in New York and Los Angeles 
which are together worth nearly £8m. The subsidiaries are thought to own
 Radcliffe’s property in the United States.

Gilmore
 Jacobs has no shortage of ready cash with £9.3m in the bank - an 
increase of more than £5m on the previous year - which the actor can 
access at any time.

Radcliffe, born in Fulham, south west London, made his acting debut in BBC1 drama David Copperfield in 1999.

He
 beat 40,000 other young hopefuls to be chosen as the hero of the JK 
Rowling books, first appearing in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's 
Stone in 2001, aged just 12.

Since then, he has starred in another seven Harry Potter films including the final Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two released in 2011.

Where the magic began: Daniel aged 12, as Harry Potter in the first film in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, in 2001

Radcliffe turned to the stage in 2007, famously appearing nude in a London and New York production of Equus before trying his hand at musical theatre in a 2011 revival on Broadway of the aptly-named musical How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.

This year he was praised for his portrayal of beat poet Allen Ginsberg in independent film Kill Your Darlings.

Last year, Radcliffe admitted in an interview that he felt embarrassed by the amount of money he has made through acting.

 ‘I got paid so well for doing the Harry Potter films, it's ridiculous. If somebody asked me, “Did you think you deserve that money?” No, of course I didn't,’ he told Parade magazine.

‘But would you have taken it anyway?’ Of course. I happened to have found this industry where people get paid stupid amounts of money.

‘That's the reality. I feel almost guilty for having done so well out of Potter.’
