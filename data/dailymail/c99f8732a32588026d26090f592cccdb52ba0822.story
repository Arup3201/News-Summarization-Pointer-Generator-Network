Rap music mogul Marion 'Suge' Knight has been hospitalized after suffering two falls behind bars last week in Las Vegas.

Attorneys Richard Schonfeld and Julie Raye said Monday that Knight is being treated for a painful bruise on the back of his neck and head after falling Thursday while doctors were checking him for dizziness and chest pain.

Judge Joe M. Bonaventure set bail at $75,000 pending Knight's return to California to face a felony robbery charge that could represent a third-strike felony for Knight. 

The 49-year-old founder of Death Row Records was arrested Wednesday in Las Vegas and comedian Katt Williams was arrested in the Los Angeles area on a celebrity photographer's complaint that they stole her camera September 5 in Beverly Hills.

Sources told TMZ that Knight took two falls behind bars. Once in his cell and again while getting an x-ray in the medical ward.

After the second fall, Knight's lawyer had him transferred to a local hospital. 

Sources went on to tell TMZ that they believe his illness is being caused by a blood clot in his lung.

Knight has allegedly been on a heavy dose of blood thinners ever since he was shot in August at a pre-Video Music Awards party hosted by Chris Brown.

However, Knight was reportedly not able to take the medication behind bars and that was what caused the clot.

Allegations: Knight (left, in February 2003) and Comedian Katt Williams (right in April 2013) were arrested and charged with one county of robbery on Wednesday, October 29 after a paparazzo reported the men stole her camera in Beverly Hills, California on September 5

Ill health: Knight was behind bars at the Clark County Detention Center (pictured) when he fainted twice last week. After the second fall, Knight's attorney had him transferred to a local hospital

Bedridden: The rap mogul was scheduled to appear for a hearing on Monday, but could not attend since he was still hospitalized at University Medical Center in Las Vegas
