As a tourism chief battling one of the soggiest summers on record, Malcolm Bell might be excused for cursing the heavens above.

Perhaps surprisingly, however, he also has a more earthly target.

For Mr Bell doesn’t just blame the weather for putting a dampener on his year, but also the weathermen and women who predict it.

Forecasters are ‘obsessed’ with rain, he claims, delighting in highlighting the bad days and ignoring dry and sunny spells.

And the unusually heavy rainfall has given forecasters plenty of opportunity to deliver the depressing news.

Gloomy: Visit Cornwall chief Malcolm Bell says forecasters delight in bringing news of rain

June was one of the wettest on record in the UK, with torrential rainfall causing floods in many areas around the country, and the April - June quarter was the wettest second quarter in the UK since records began in 1910.

And now even river-based activities have been affected by the downpours .

The latest casualty of the wet weather is the annual ceremony of Swan Upping.

The historic event - a census of swans - has been cancelled for the entire week for the first time in hundreds 
of years because of the flooded River Thames.

The event dates from the twelfth century and should have started yesterday and lasted until Friday.

But an announcement last night said it had been cancelled because of the dangerous state of the river.

Danger warnings are in place along 
most of the Thames from West London to Oxfordshire advising boats to 
keep off the river because of the strong stream following recent heavy 
rain.

The Queen’s Swanmarker David Barber 
said: 'It is very disappointing but navigation warnings are in force 
along the river and we cannot take chances.'

traditional uniforms travel the river in rowing boats from 
Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey to Abingdon on Oxfordshire taking a census 
of swans, checking their health and marking young birds.

The Queen still retains the right to 
ownership of all unmarked mute swans in open water, but only exercises 
her ownership on certain stretches of the Thames and surrounding 
tributaries.

The deluges have also led to the need for regular use of the largest plughole in the world in Ladybower Reservoir in Derbyshire.

It was built to prevent the reservoir from breaking its banks by creating a whirlpool on the surface, sucking the water down and through a valve house at the bottom of the dam.

Commonly referred to as a plughole, 
it measures 24 metres in diameter and is one of two in the three-mile 
long reservoir, which is the lowest of three reservoirs in the Derwent 
Valley area of the Peak District.

The
Visit Cornwall chief believes their ‘flippant remarks’ could cost the 
economy millions in lost revenue from tourism, and he says colleagues at
other resorts, including Blackpool and Bournemouth, agree.

‘Rather
than help the public in these difficult and austere times to have at 
least some comfort and pleasure in their holidays and free times, they 
seem obsessed with making them even more depressed,’ he said.

‘I despair when weather presenters 
all too often seem to delight and get excited about poor weather and 
skip over the periods of fair weather.’

Presenters gloss over the details of 
the forecast, he said, leaving viewers uncertain whether they face a day
of downpours or one of ten-minute showers.

Mr
Bell said the tourism industry in Cornwall could lose as much as 
£60million this summer, after the wettest April to June on record.

He said June’s rain alone brought a fall of around 20 per cent in custom for some businesses.

And he believes throwaway remarks by TV weather presenters who ‘try to be stand-up comics’  are the problem.

He said: ‘They say things like “we’ll 
have our wellies on until October” or confuse showers, which can last 
ten minutes, with a rainy day and put people off.’

The Met Office said weather reporters 
permanently based at media organisations including the BBC tend to 
follow house styles set by the broadcasters.

‘I don’t think anyone would disagree 
when we say that the weather so far this June and the early part of July
has been rather disappointing,’ it said, adding that it worked with the
tourist industry to provide localised forecasts for resorts and 
attractions.

One thing which – for the moment at 
least – seems to be ignoring Mr Bell’s plea for good news is the weather
itself, with the South West seeing more torrential rain yesterday.

Parts of Cornwall have had more than 100mm of rain so far this July, 
compared with an average expectation of just under 70mm for the entire 
month.

Elsewhere, a coastal road was 
literally washed away at Seaton in Devon, while Worcester was flooded 
for the second time this year after the River Severn burst its banks.

An annual sheep fair in Somerset that
has been running for more than six centuries has been cancelled for the
first time ever due to weather.

The event, due to have been held on 22 August, would have been the 664th Priddy Sheep Fair.

The fair has been held every year since 1348, apart from in 2001 and 2007 because of foot-and-mouth disease.

Martin Edwards, chairman of the Sheep Fair Committee, said cancelling it had been 'a really tough decision to take'.

The
fair moved from Wells to the Mendip Hills village in 1348 because of 
the Black Death, although evidence has been found of a fair being held 
in Priddy before that.

Organisers said it would take several weeks of fine weather to dry the ground out

Mr
Edwards added : 'We had a realistic look at all the options that were 
available to us but, in the end, the safety of our helpers and visitors 
attending the fair had to come first.

'We
must also consider that the other fields we use are based on the 
goodwill of the landowners, who allow their land to be used for free, 
but don’t want to see the fields turned to mud.'

Meanwhile, a farmer who set up a 
company selling vegetable boxes has suspended his business 
'indefinitely' after weeks of heavy rainfall left fields flooded.

The Nearly Naked Veg Company of Avonwick, Devon, was created four years ago and has delivered up to 220 boxes every week.

But the weather, along with an 
unfavourably long growing season in 2011 and increased fuel costs mean 
it has been losing £2,500 a month.

Founder Ben Brunning, 29, said he now intends to concentrate on his wholesale vegetable business.

Mr Brunning told customers: 'I have 
farmed all my life but I can honestly say this year has been the worst 
year in my career for growing horticultural produce.'

He said that a mild winter meant 
crops had been harvested months earlier than normal, leaving almost 
nothing left for the spring.

He added: 'Everything has either been drowned by rain or is not growing through lack of sun. It’s very sad.

'But we are not the only guys in this 
situation, all over the place growers are struggling and horticultural 
crops are failing left right and centre.'

But there is some good news on the way - Britain is finally expected to get drier and warmer next week.

Tom Tobler, a forecaster with 
MeteoGroup, the Press Association’s weather division, said: 'We will get
high pressure building to the west, and it looks like that’s going to 
give us a couple of dry days on Friday and Saturday.

'It looks like there’s going to be 
high pressure across the south of the UK, so it looks like it’s going to
be generally drier next week. But northern areas will see some rain, 
particularly northern Scotland.

'It looks like southern areas can 
expect some drier and warmer weather. It’s more like average summer 
conditions and weather we would expect.'
