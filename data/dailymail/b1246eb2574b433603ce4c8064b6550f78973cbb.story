It was very happy families for Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall this weekend as they took baby daughter Mia to the Salperton Park Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

In the adorable pictures Zara is seen carefully positioning an ice cream cone in her mouth whilst holding up the five-month-old.

Her husband, Mike, took over watching their daughter so that Zara, daughter of Princess Anne and granddaughter of The Queen, could compete at the event.

Dressed in a pale blue t-shirt and 
sandy coloured shorts, Mike, 35, pushed Mia’s buggy around the field and was 
also pictured dutifully grabbing salad tortilla wraps and ice creams for his family.

Zara, 33, wore white jodhpurs and a blue jacket and riding hat, no doubt sweltering under all the riding gear during the summer heat yesterday.

Mia was dressed in a pale blue playsuit and cute cream sunhat to protect her head from the sun.

Zara and Mike were joined by friends 
who were all too happy to offer a helping hand, holding Mia whilst Zara 
prepared for her ride.

Salperton is a village in the Cotswolds about eight miles east of Cheltenham in Gloucestershire.

The horse trials take place over this 
weekend within the picturesque surroundings of Salperton 
Park House and village.

This is the eleventh running of the 
event which has continued to grow in status as an opportunity for 
British and overseas riders and horses to prepare themselves for autumn 
championships and other events.

Show-jumping and dressage take place at the Equestrian event.

Former world eventing champion Zara

Games later this summer.

The riding star became the first member of the Royal Family to win an Olympic medal as part of Team GB back in 2012.

Her mother presented Zara with her winning medal at the celebrated event in London.

Zara’s inclusion in the World 
Equestrian Games, which start in August, mean she has a chance to 
represent Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

Zara revealed that she will ride her

'It’s fantastic to be part of a team again,' Zara told the news channel.

'High Kingdom has improved each year and every time I've taken him to a big competition he's got better and better.

'He's felt good this year and hopefully will peak at the right time.'

Just as Zara is riding high, husband Mike is also at an exciting point in his career. The former England rugby champion, who played centre, is in discussions about how it will pan out.

As his current contract at the Gloucester club ends in July, he told the Telegraph that he is 'in limbo.'

The player said: 'The only certainty at the moment is that Nigel’s [Davies, former head coach] departure has put everything up in the air.

'It’s almost put me back to where we were two years ago.'

The younger Prince was victorious.
