In the line of fire: Sharpen positioned his patrol SUV between the stopped traffic and the PT Cruiser that was reaching speeds of 100 mph

As the PT Cruiser that was being driven by 25-year-old Jose Luis Alejo-Zavalija approached him, the man slammed on the brakes.  

Sharpen positioned his patrol SUV between the traffic which had been halted and the PT Cruiser. 

'I knew he was coming at me and I knew there was no shoulder on the freeway,' Sharpen said.

'I knew that the traffic behind me, those people in those cars, their lives were at risk.

I had to do something to protect them. I kind of put my vehicle in the lane that he was going to be at and accelerated and came to a stop at about a 45 degree angle. 

And I heard the car and the tires squeal from him braking.'
