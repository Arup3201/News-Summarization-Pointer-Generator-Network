Samsung posted net profits of 5.04 trillion won - $4.44 billion - US dollars for the first quarter of 2012, up 81.3 percent from 2.78 trillion won a year earlier

Samsung sold 20,000 of its Galaxy handsets every hour during the months from January to Match - outselling Apple's iPhone by 44.5 million to 35.1 million.

One in four phones sold is now a Samsung - putting the electronics giant ahead of Nokia for the first  time.

The sales catapulted the Korean giant to a record $5.2 billion quarterly profit.

The record figures came as a respected analyst from Forrester research warned that Apple would 'decline' without Steve Jobs's leadership.

'When Steve Jobs departed, he took three things with him, charismatic leadership, the ability to take big risks, and an unparalleled ability to envision and design products,' says George Colony, CEO of Forrester research.

'Apple’s momentum will carry it for 24-48 months. But without the arrival of a new charismatic leader it, like Sony will coast, and then decelerate.'

The new figures seem to tally with Colony's prediction.

Chairman Lee Kun-hee's South Korean group, whose $190 billion market value is 11 times that of Japanese rival Sony Corp, sold 93.5 million handsets in the first quarter.

During the first quarter of this year, more than one in every four phones sold was a Samsung handset - according to Strategy Analytics, overtaking long-time handset leader Nokia.    

The total included 44.5 million smartphones, giving Samsung a 30.6 percent share of the high-end market.

Apple's sales of 35.1 million iPhones gave it a 24.1 percent share.   

Demand for the company's Galaxy S2 smartphones beat expectations, and the Galaxy Note tablet computer also sold well

Samsung reported record first-quater profits boosted by a surge in sales of its Galaxy smartphones as it outsold Apple's iPhone and became the world's top mobile phone maker

‘Samsung and Apple are out-competing most major rivals and the smartphone market is at risk of becoming a two-horse race,’ said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics.    

CLSA analyst Matt Evans said in a recent report that ‘Samsung's smartphone success in the first quarter was the flip-side of Nokia's disappointment.’    

The near duopoly in high-end smartphones is unlikely to come under much threat this year or next, according to Bernstein analysts, and Samsung will look to keep that momentum going next week with the launch in London of a third generation of Galaxy S, hoping to boost sales ahead of the summer Olympics, where the group is among the leading sponsors.    

‘The Galaxy S 3's 
specifications are expected to be sensational and it's already drawing 
strong interest from the market and consumers,’ said Brian Park, an 
analyst at Tong Yang Securities.

The new Galaxy will be powered by 
Samsung's quad-core microprocessor, which the company hopes to see used 
in handsets sold by Nokia, HTC and Motorola, as well as Apple, its 
biggest customer for components.    

‘We
anticipate very strong demand for the Galaxy S 3,’ Robert Yi, Samsung's
senior vice president and head of investor relations, told analysts. 
‘When there's strong demand in the market, we don't necessarily need to 
spend a lot of marketing dollars to promote sales.’   

 

Analysts warned that the battle for domination of the lucrative smartphone market was becoming a 'two-horse race' between Apple and Samsung

Samsung's dominance of the mobile phone sector ends a long reign for Nokia.

Nokia became the world's largest cellphone maker 1998 when
it overtook Motorola - at a time when Samsung had just entered the industry -
and it controlled around 40 percent of the market for years before Apple Inc's
iPhone was unveiled in 2007, launching the smartphone boom.          

Some analysts said losing the top spot would be a blow to
Nokia, but would have little impact on its attempt to turn around its fortunes.      

‘I think it will hurt them from a PR
perspective, but in reality it does not change anything: at the end of the day
the problems are the same if they remain the No 1 or become the No 2,’ said
analyst Carolina Milanesi at Gartner. 

‘In contrast it will be greeted with euphoria by Samsung -
they'll be dancing from the boardroom to the factory floor,’ Wood said.
