A woman was run over and killed by a snowplow at a Massachusetts condo complex moments after the driver offered to clear her parking space following a snowstorm.

Cynthia Levine, 57, was struck just before 10 a.m. on Monday in the parking lot at the complex in Weymouth and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Her friend, Gloria Moran was with her when she died and said Levine was only outside to help her clean her truck off, according to The Boston Globe. 

Condo: Cynthia Levine, 57, was struck and killed by a snow plow at Tara Gardens condominiums in Weymouth, pictured here, 

Moran told the newspaper: [She said to me] 'I don't want you to go out by yourself, I'll go with you. She added: 'It's a tragedy. It's so sad.'

According to police, the incident happened at Tara Gardens condominiums in Weymouth.

Weymouth Police were called to the parking lot area of a condominium complex at roughly 9:44 a.m. after receiving a report of the incident.

A spokesman for the Norfolk district attorney's office said the plow was owned by a contractor working for condo management. 

Its thought that the company that owned the plow is called Skinner Overlook. 

Frank Sullivan, the owner of the company told The Boston Globe the woman’s death was a 'tragic accident’.  

Moran, said she and Levine had been friends for  six years and got along well as they both lived in the same apartment building.

She said that they were outside clearing snow off their vehicles when the snowplow operator pulled up next to them. 

Once they had pulled their vehicles out, the snowplow driver volunteered to clear their parking spaces, she said.

Afterwards, Moran said that once the spots were clear, she started backing Levine's car into its parking space. 

At that time, Levine told her she was going to speak with the tow truck driver to 'ask the plow guy if he could try not to block us in again with the snow.'

But as Levine walked away from the car, Moran said she lost sight of her and she heard a loud thump. 

Moran said she looked toward the snowplow, which had come to a stop in the parking lot and shouted at the driver: 'Cindy is under the truck!''

The driver jumped out of his truck, rushed over to the victim and pulled her out from under the passenger side of his pickup truck. 

He was devastated and yelled: 'Oh my God I hit her. I didn't see her.'

Other neighbors rushed out to help, but Moran said it was immediately clear her injury was fatal.

The driver remained at the scene. But no charges have been filed.

However, her death remains under investigation by the police and district attorney's office.
