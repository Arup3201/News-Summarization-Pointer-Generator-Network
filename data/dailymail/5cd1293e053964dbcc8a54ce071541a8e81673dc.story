A computer expert has managed track down the delighted owner of a memory stick full of treasured photographs living half way across the world, two years after she believed they were lost forever.

Jonathan Stainsby, 26, was handed two USB sticks by a friend after they lay unclaimed for two years after being discovered in a Marks and Spencer store.

The memory sticks were full of photographs, and IT expert and photography enthusiast Jonathan quickly realised how precious the images could be and determined to find the owner.

Amazing: Jonathan  managed use technology to track down the photos' owner  half way across the world

Technology: When Jonathan put this picture in, it matched to a woman called Narien - who would eventually turn out to be the owner of the photographs

So he set about selecting images and running them through Google image search, trying to get the perfect match. 

And his hard work paid off, when he managed to find the name Narien.

But even with the unusual name, he was still struggling to find the mystery owner.

'None of the names was Narien, so I went onto Facebook and trawled through some of the photographs of people with that name to see if I recognised anyone from the pictures,' he explained.

'Then I went back to the USB stick and looked at some of the documents on it and found the surname Meyer.

'I typed that in Facebook and a lady called Narien Meyer, from South Africa, came up and I managed to positively identify her.'

Narien, it transpired, was a teacher now living in Oman - almost 4,000 miles from Jonathan's home in Hartlepool.

Extra: Jonathan then turned back to the USB sticks to find more information, and then found a surname

Then he hit another hurdle: he sent a message to Narien, to let her know he had found her photos.

But she didn't respond, so he did a little more sleuthing work and found a friend who was willing to help.

And finally, he was able get the pictures back to their rightful owner, who is said to be 'absolutely delighted'. 

Narien sent Jonathan a thank you message saying that she believes she lost the sticks possibly on a visit to Barnard Castle in 2013.

It said: 'Thank you so much for getting my pics back to me! I lost my bag with the USBs in it in Barnard Castle two years ago - or so I thought.

'We probably stopped at other places as well but I'm not that familiar with the area. 

'Amazing that after two years you got it back to me I'm now in Saudi Arabia, and most of the photos were taken in Kuwait and Oman, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where I've been teaching. 

'Thanks to you I'll have my memories!'

Jonathan is equally as pleased.

'I had a one in 7.126billion chance of success and with hard work I accomplished it - and made new friends some 3,6660 miles away,' he said.
