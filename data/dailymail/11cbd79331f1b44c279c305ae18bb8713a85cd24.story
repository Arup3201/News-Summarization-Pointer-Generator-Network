Milena Gagic was killed after she ventured onto a railway line and was struck by a train at 55mph

A 16-year-old schoolgirl was accidentally killed by a train after she sat down between a set of railway tracks to talk to her best friend.

Milena Gagic happily ventured onto the line just after midnight with friend Amelia Hustwick when she was hit by the last Manchester Victoria to Leeds Northern Rail at around 55mph.

The straight A student, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, who was tipped for a place at Oxford or Cambridge, suffered fatal injuries in the impact and died at the scene on December 13.

An inquest heard the pair had ventured onto a public crossing near Hipperholme tunnel after a night with friends and decided to sit down for a chat as they believed the last train had already passed.

The girls, who had been friends since they were babies, had visited a Costcutter store that Friday evening to buy ingredients for baking before spending time at the home of Amelia's brother.

They left at 10.30pm to go back to Milena's house to get some food before meeting some more friends at a nearby park.

In a statement Amelia, also 16, said: 'We had arranged to meet two friends. However they went home and Milena and I went over to the park on our own. 

'We then decided to walk along the main road to the train tracks because it is quiet. We have been there on three occasions in the past. It was quite late so we didn't think trains would be running.

'We sat between the tracks on the crossing. We sat there laughing and giggling. We were sat facing each other in between the tracks.'

But shortly after a train came hurtling down the tracks and only Amelia was able to jump out of its path.

She added: 'It was going fast but I am not sure how fast. I didn't hear a train horn. I assumed Milena had jumped out of the way because I couldn't see her anywhere. 

Milena and her best friend Amelia Hustwick had been enjoying a night with friends when they decided to sit between the track (pictured) for a chat, thinking that the last train would have already passed

'I looked to my right and could see her 10 metres away in track where the train had passed through.'

Amelia tried to revive her best friend whilst waiting for emergency services to arrive on the scene. 

She said: 'I have known her my whole life and consider her to be my best friend. We are both the same age, 16, and I would describe us as two peas in a pod.

'I cannot recall my first encounter with her but mum and dad say I have known her since birth. 

'We spent all our time together and I would describe her as my favourite person in the whole world. She was a lovely person and her family became a family to me.

'Milena and I went to the level crossing because we find it a nice place to hang out. I believe it was an accident. Neither of us had consumed any alcohol.'

A post-mortem report confirmed Milena died from massive head injuries and that a toxicology report showed no traces of alcohol and drug misuse.

Her mother Leanne a director for Leeds City Council told the Halifax inquest: 'On Friday 12th December Milena was at home with me and her dad at 18.10pm. 

'We were sat around the table eating a meal and Milena left the house to meet her friend Amelia.

'Milena returned home at 23.20pm. I was up stairs asleep in bed and woken by her. I could smell perfume and smoke on her clothes. 

Milena was a straight A student had been studying A Levels when she died on December 13. She was tipped for a place at Oxford or Cambridge University after being chosen for a scheme

'I asked her to put her clothes in the wash because I could smell smoke. I do not recall her responding and I fell back asleep.

She added: 'I would like it noted that she was a straight A student. She had achieved fantastic grades in school and had been chosen to go on a scheme for Oxford and Cambridge. 

'She was a very sensible, diligent caring individual who would never with any intent put herself at risk. She was not under the influence of anything at the time of her death.' 

Northern Rail train driver Martin Jones, told the inquest that he had 'felt a small bump' as he passed the crossing but had not initially suspected he had hit anyone. 

He said: 'I was on full power and the train was nearing 55mph. I didn't sound the horn because there is a time requirement and you can only do so between 7am and 11pm. I felt a small bump.' 

The inquest heard that Milena was a sixth form student studying A Levels at Crossley Heath School in Halifax.

An inquest heard that Amelia was able to jump out the way of the oncoming train but Milena (pictured) didn't and suffered fatal injuries in the impact

She had confided to Amelia that she had been teased by bullies at her previous school but was happy at Crossley Heath.

In a statement Wendy Moffat, headmistress at Crossley Heath, said: 'Milena was a wonderful, bright, talented girl who had a great future ahead of her. 

'She was so excited to be studying for A-levels at Crossley Heath and she made a really positive impression upon everyone who taught her. 

'We're devastated and she will be missed so much by her friends and the whole school community.

'Our thoughts, best wishes and sympathy are with Milena's family right now.. We are so desperately sorry for their loss and will do everything we can to support them through this.' 

West Yorkshire Coroner Oliver Longstaff issued a warning about the dangers of loitering on railway lines as he recorded a verdict of accidental death.

He said: 'There is no indication that this should be anything other than a tragic end to a happy evening. 

'I am satisfied that Milena and Amelia went onto the tracks without thought of doing themselves harm.

'They had had an evening with friends and they were doing something they had done many times before. It was possibly not a very wise thing to do but nobody is on trial here. 

'The warnings on the crossing are there to be seen - "stop, look, listen" and they did not have to sit between the tracks, it is a remarkable thing to have done but the completely unexpected occurred in tragic consequences.

'Milena would have had absolutely no idea what happened to her.'

He added: 'I have considered whether to make a report to see if anything could be done to prevent future deaths because of pedestrian crossings on railway tracks. 

West Yorkshire Coroner Oliver Longstaff issued a warning about the dangers of loitering on railway lines as he recorded a verdict of accidental death 

'My view is that if there is a public road or way over a rail way track then that railway authority are very limited as to what they can do to prevent access and as a matter of law they cannot prevent access.

'There are warnings to stop, look and listen on either side. It is clear that the girls thought the last train had gone. 

'Whatever steps that might be taken cannot legislate that someone would choose to sit between the tracks.'
