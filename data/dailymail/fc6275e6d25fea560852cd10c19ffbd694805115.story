TV chef Keith Floyd, who lost a fortune on wine, women and failed restaurants, left just £7,500 in his will, it has been revealed

Fast-living TV chef Keith Floyd, who lost a fortune on wine, women and failed restaurants, left just £7,500 in his will.

The financial reality of his playboy lifestyle has been revealed in probate records, confirming what friends and lovers already knew – the talented raconteur was not so good at dealing with money.

High Court documents, only now published four years after he died of a heart attack at the age of 65, name his two children as sole beneficiaries.

The star’s fourth and last spouse, Tess, said she  believed that heavy drinking,  eccentricity and chaotic finances led to his downfall.

‘It was probably a combination of all three,’ she said.

‘I just reached the stage where I’d had enough and, thankfully, I’ve moved on with my life.’

Floyd was the doyen of TV chefs and his BBC series – including Floyd On Food and Floyd On France – attracted millions of fans.

But behind the scenes, the wine-quaffing  ex-Army officer was draining his bank accounts, with failed businesses and marriages. 

He sold his first three restaurants, launched in  Bristol during the 1970s, to escape debts, while a fourth, L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue in Provence, also ran into deep trouble.

Later he lost £1 million on his Devon pub The Maltsters Arms and was declared bankrupt for the second time in 1996.

The star's fourth and last spouse, Tess (pictured with the chef), said she believed that heavy drinking, eccentricity and chaotic finances led to his downfall. 'It was probably a combination of all three,'she said. 'I just reached the stage where I'd had enough and, thankfully, I've moved on with my life'

Along the way, he settled four divorces – to Jesmond, Julie, Shaunagh and Tess. 

Floyd, who lived in Montfrin  in Provence, drew up his will just ten months before his death in 2009.

High Court documents reveal his entire £7,500 UK estate was left to his children from his first two marriages, Patrick, 44, and Poppy, 29. 

But secretive French probate law means his estate there will not be revealed.
