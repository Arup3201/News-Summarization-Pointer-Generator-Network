Social worker Claire Selwood sued because Burton had warned that he wanted to kill her two days before his discharge from Sunderland's Cherry Knowle Hospital

A social worker who nearly bled to death after being stabbed six times by a patient has finally won a seven year battle for compensation.

Mother-of-three Claire Selwood was stabbed by Graham Burton, 45, at a school in County Durham in 2006.

The kitchen knife used by Burton was left stuck in the social worker’s back after the attack and Ms Selwood lost five pints of blood.

Burton was later jailed indefinitely after admitting attempted murder.

Ms Selwood sued and the Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust and Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, because Burton had warned that he wanted to kill her two days before his discharge from Sunderland’s Cherry Knowle Hospital - but the threat was never passed on to her.

She also sued her employer, Durham County Council, but the claim was unsuccessful.

Newcastle County Court initially dismissed the case against the trusts on the grounds they did not owe Ms Selwood a duty of care.

But the ruling was overturned by the Court of Appeal in London and Ms Selwood has since suffered a lengthy battle to win her case.

It accepted it was arguable that the trusts owed her a duty of care based on their responsibilities under an agreed protocol.

Ms Selwood, who now lives in Morpeth, Northumberland, settled out of court with the NHS trusts, which have agreed to pay her what is understood to be a six-figure sum.

Despite his chilling promise to attack the mother-of-three, Burton was signed out of the hospital and set free to carry out his threat.

Just hours after his release on Burton turned up at a school in County Durham and attacked Miss Selwood, 36, as she prepared for a morning meeting.

The mother-of-three said she was given very little help by her employers

Miss Selwood described how she had been dealing with a difficult case as a social worker involving Burton.

She
 said: 'Graham had been a very odd character but it wasn't an unusual 
thing to come across in my line of work. On the day of the attack I... 
walked in surprised to see him knowing that he had been put in hospital.

'There
 had been no communication to say that he had been released from 
hospital. Had I known that he had made threats against my life I would 
have been able to assess the situation and distance myself from the 
whole thing for my own safety.

'Finding
 out he had said that he wanted to kill me on the spot was a shock. I 
was annoyed that this hadn't been communicated to me when he had said it
 to two different people.

'I was aware he disliked me but not that he wanted to kill me.'

Claire described the day of the attack as very surreal and still, to this day, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder because of it as well as other disabilities which affect her mobility.

She now has scars covering her torso, back and forearm from that day and is thankful to even be alive as if the knife had been a few millimetres lower it would have hit her heart and she would have bled to death.

She said: 'I had simply gone in for what I thought was a normal meeting and was shocked to see him there but figured he must have just been discharged from hospital.

'When I went into the meeting room with another member of staff I didn't actually realise he had stabbed me until my leg have way and I saw blood on the floor.

'My colleague hadn't even noticed and says that it all happened so fast she didn't register what was going on.'

Scars: The horrific injuries Miss Selwood sustained in the attack

She added: 'I remember asking the nurse in the hospital if I was going to die and she said no but I guess they're meant to say that.

'I don't remember much of the actual attack but when police were called Graham apparently walked outside and calmly handed himself in.'

Miss Selwood still has to deal with the effects of the attack on a daily basis. She is unable to walk very far and has recently got herself a mobility scooter to help.

She cannot cope well in big crowds and will always assess any situation just before leaving the house.

Her three sons, Flynn, 18, Conor, 17, and Lucas, nine, were all young at the time of the attack and have also been severely distressed and traumatised from the attack on their mother.

Miss Selwood said she was given very little help by her employers, particularly Durham County Council, which she claims ‘washed its hands’ of her after she moved jobs.

She said: 'You’re treated like cannon fodder - you’re facing verbal assaults and physical threats and there’s no back-up from the local authority.

'Social workers are getting back to their own kids at 7pm or 8pm completely exhausted and there’s no support for them.

'The usual result is social workers end up going off on sick leave, and then moving jobs. This means that good workers are not retained by the authority.

'However, it also means that the authority drain the last hours of life out of their workers, and do absolutely nothing to counteract the effect on them and their families of doing this dangerous job.'

Durham County Council did not wish to comment.

Commenting on the settlement, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust and Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are pleased for Ms Selwood that her claim has now been resolved.

'Mental health services have changed considerably since this appalling attack. Both organisations have made improvements to the way they work and acted promptly to implement the recommendations of an independent investigation into the incident in 2010.

'Both trusts offer their best wishes to Ms Selwood and her family for the future.'
