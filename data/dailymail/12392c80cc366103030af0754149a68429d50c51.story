China is well known for its mass-production economy.

But these factories are about as far from Foxconn's iPad plants as the imagination can wander.

In Dafen, a suburb of the coastal city of Shenzhen in China's south-eastern Guangdong province, thousands of artists labour constantly to reproduce famous paintings for the mass market.

Known as Dafen Oil Painting Village, the district is believed to be the largest mass producer of oil paintings in the world.

Artists here manufacture some 60 per cent of the total global volume in such knock-off canvases, according to the China Daily.

Many of the artists are trained in the required techniques at Chinese art academies.

But faced with the difficulty of making a living from their own compositions, they produce dozens of replicas of iconic paintings daily to make ends meet.

Prices on DafenVillageOnline.com, a website set up to sell works directly to consumers overseas, average about $60 (£40), but many are no doubt passed on wholesale for far less to be sold in many countries for similar prices.

Things are changing in Dafen, however, as the continuing economic troubles in the West hit the purchashing power of their traditional customers.

While in the past artists produced endless copies of iconic Western paintings by the likes of Van Gogh, Monet and Picasso, these days they have had to adapt to cater to customers closer to home.

A local newspaper report seen by the BBC claimed that exports fell by more than half in the first half of last year alone after a collapse in Western orders.

One artist, Weng Yugo, 27, told the broadcaster that nearly all his Western customers had lately been replaced by Chinese, and he had been forced to adapt his work.

'There is a difference in taste,' he said. 'I'd say that Westerners prefer classical pictures which tend to be very dark. Chinese people like bright colours.'
