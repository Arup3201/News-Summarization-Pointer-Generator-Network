Toilet paper has become the barometer for how confident people are in their economy and whether they can afford a minor splurge - like a luxury brand 

Sales of luxury toilet paper are being heralded as the newest way to measure the economy - and judging by our current spending habits things in Britain are looking up.

Spending on products for short-term use is crucial in revealing how confident a country's population are in their own economic prospects - and luxury loo paper sales  suggest the recession is well and truly over.

A report by market intelligence firm Euromonitor International found the UK stands out among the European countries as only 5.3 per cent of £1.9billion toilet paper sales were made up from the cheaper brands. 

The analysts found although top brands like Cushelle, Andrex and Velvet are a little pricier, they are a luxury most people can afford.

They said in the report: 'While the idea of luxury toilet paper may be slightly odd, its performance suggests otherwise.' 

They added that toilet paper has become the barometer for how confident people are in their economy and whether they can afford a minor splurge.

Waitrose recently announced that premium toilet tissue sales are up 12 per cent year on year.

Victoria Fletcher, the store's paperware buyer, told The Times: 'It's the little luxuries which are sometimes the best.' 

Abid Ditta from Star Tissue UK told newspaper: 'We have definitely seen an increase in demand for better quality products since we have invested in a new state-of-the-art toilet tissue production line.'

Meanwhile sales of luxury toilet paper are also being enjoyed in the US with the market hitting $1.4 billion last year - and sales are still growing.

With the recovery of the UK economy consumers have gone back to buying branded products

The Washington Post reported luxury toilet paper sales have grown more than 70 percent since 2000.

The analysts from Euromonitor wrote in their report: 'Higher growth is expected out of the luxury segment as the improved economy allows consumers to satisfy their desire for comfort.'  

Toilet paper is not the only unusual way to measure the economy.

The Hemline Index was established by economist George Taylor at Wharton School of Business in 1926, when he noticed a correlation between good times and short skirts.

When the economy was good women would wear higher hemlines to show off the more expensive hosiery compared to rough times where the skirts would become longer so women could hide their cheap stockings.  

Autumn/Winter 2015 collections from the biggest fashion houses saw high hemlines at Topshop, Julien MacDonald and Giles - while flares were also a big hit, implying there is money to spend on additional material. 

Hairstyles are another economic indicator.

MailOnline reported earlier this month that the the growing popularity of shorter haircuts is a sign of economic recovery, since they require more frequent trips to the salon and are costlier to maintain.

Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, who is the face of L'Oreal, debuted her new layered bob just last week on the Graham Norton Show, while Kim Kardashian also recently braved a shorter cut.

Toilet paper sales in the UK have grown by 2 per cent over the last year - the industry is worth £1.9 billion
