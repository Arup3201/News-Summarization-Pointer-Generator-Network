Scotland Yard is investigating a far-right group after members launched 'Christian patrols' to 'draw out' and confront Muslims by drinking and smoking outside one of Britain's biggest mosques.

Vigilantes from Britain First, a group led by a former BNP linchpin, filmed themselves on Brick Lane in east London and told Asian men: 'This is our country. You want to live here, you adhere by our laws'.

The group says it is a response to 'Muslim patrols' that walked the area and warned couples holding hands, uncovered women or those drinking 
it was a 'Muslim area' and they faced 'hell fire'.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Message: Former BNP councillor Paul Golding, now chairman of Britain First, has led 'Christian Patrols' in east London used to 'draw out' Muslims in the area and hand out warning leaflets

'Bait': members stood outside the East London Mosque swigging beer and smoking cigarettes as they hoped to confront Muslims during Friday prayers

Inflammatory: Members then unfurled this banner outside the mosque on film, which contained no confrontations with worshippers

Three members were jailed at the Old Bailey last month for repeatedly trying to enforce Sharia law.

Britain First chairman Paul Golding, a former BNP councillor, said they were using members with cans of lager as 'bait' for Muslims outside the East London Mosque in Whitechapel.

'This is going to be a regular thing. We’re going to be out there every weekend to draw out these "Muslim Patrols",' he said after the footage emerged.

Golding is currently on bail for alleged harassment of hate preacher Anjem Choudary, who has been a vocal backer of 'Muslim Patrols'.

The video also shows him and his 15 supporters entering the East End in Gulf War vehicles and then later unfurling a banner outside the mosque that said 'resistance'.

It ends without any confrontation but uses an image of murdered soldier Lee Rigby, along with the message: 'The day Lee Rigby was murdered, thousands of patriots were born. The fightback has begun'.

Response: A member smokes and drinks outside the mosque, and his group claims this is a direct reaction to previous 'Muslim Patrols'

'Resistance': Britain First members walked Brick Lane and Whitechapel in east London, and told this group of men: 'This is our country. You want to live here, you adhere by our laws'

The Met Police has confirmed they are aware of the film but have not made any arrests.

'Police at Tower Hamlets are aware of an internet video showing recent activity on the Borough,' a spokesman said.

'The Metropolitan Police Service takes these 
incidents very seriously and any activities that may raise community 
tension will be monitored'.

The video has led to an outpouring of anger from east London community leaders.

The Bishop of Stepney, Rt Rev Adrian Newman, said: 'East London is 
proud of its generous attitude to diversity, based on tolerance and 
respect.

'There is no place for vigilante patrols, Christian, Muslim or any other faith, on the streets of Tower Hamlets.'

A
 spokesman for the East London Mosque called Britain First 'neo-Nazis'.

'Britain First’s patrol does
 not represent Christians, just as al-Muhajiroun’s patrols did not 
represent Muslims. Both are tiny, extreme groups, unwelcome in our 
community,' he said.

'We will not let those who espouse hatred damage our wonderful community relations.'

Jordan Horner, 19, Ricardo MacFarlane, 36, and a 23-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons were sentenced to 68 weeks, 12 months and 24 weeks in prison respectively for their Muslim Patrols.

The Old Bailey heard that in December 2012 Horner and the 23-year-old man drove alongside a couple and shouted: 'Let go of each other's hands. This is a Muslim area!'.

They stopped holding hands after the men repeated the message - and when they started again, the car blocked their way until they let go.

Two weeks later, Horner and MacFarlane attacked men drinking in Shoreditch, shouting: 'Kill the non-believers.'

Horner then punched two of the group, hitting James Forward in the jaw and knocking out Patrick Kavanagh with a sucker punch to the head.

On January 13, Horner and the 23-year-old harassed another couple, Clare Coyle and Robert Gray, as they were walking in Stepney - accusing Miss Coyle of being a 'slag'.

In an exchange filmed on Horner's phone, she replied, 'This is Great Britain. I can dress how I wish,' while the group shouted: 'Remove yourselves now. Muslim Patrol. Move away from the mosque.'
