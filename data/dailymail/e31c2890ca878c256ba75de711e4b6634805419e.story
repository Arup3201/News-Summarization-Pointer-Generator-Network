The former England midfielder showed no clear signs of injury but was withdrawn at an early stage of the 2-0 win at the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium.

City later confirmed the former England midfielder sustained the problem in the warm-up, according to boss Manuel Pellegrini.

The club tweeted: 'LAMPARD UPDATE: Pellegrini confirms Lampard was injured in the warm up and taken off as a precaution.'

City were having a run-out against the German side as part of their five-day warm-weather training camp in the emirate of their owner Sheikh Mansour.

After an uneventful first half, City won with well-taken goals from Jovetic and Dzeko after the break.

City fielded a mixture of first-team regulars, fringe players and Elite Development Squad members in their side.

One sour point saw 17-year-old forward Thierry Ambrose carried off on a stretcher after a collision early in the second half. Top scorer Sergio Aguero, recently returned from a knee injury, played the final 25 minutes. 

City's squad are due to return to Manchester on Friday and face Middlesbrough in the fourth round of the FA Cup the following day.

In their last match, Pellegrini's side were beaten 2-0 by Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium in a blow to their Premier League title hopes.
