A hapless police officer scrambled a force helicopter after spotting a 'raid' on a scrap metal yard only to find that the suspect was actually a scarecrow wearing a high-visibility jacket.

The PC was on the hunt for a gang responsible for a string of metal thefts when he saw a ‘man acting suspiciously’ on top of a pile of scrap.

Thinking the suspect was a lookout for the gang, he called for back-up and scrambled the police helicopter to give him aerial support.

D'oh! The red-faced PC had to radio HQ to tell them to stand the police helicopter down after his back-up team established that the 'man' was just a dummy (file picture)

A specialist team of traffic officers also turned up armed with a high-powered zoom camera, which officers trained on the ‘suspect’ - who was ‘standing his ground’.

It was only when traffic officers got a ‘good look’ at the suspect they realised it was a scarecrow, ironically put in place by scrap metal bosses to ward off thieves.

The red-faced PC had to radio HQ to tell them to stand the police helicopter down and confirm that a crime was not in progress.

The bungle, which took place in Hartlepool last month, was revealed in Police magazine today, but spared the officer his blushes by not naming him.

The magazine stated: 'An officer from Hartlepool was investigating a series of thefts from scrap yards.

'The offenders had narrowly escaped the officer several nights previously and he was intent on finding the culprits.

'This led to the officer giving a lot of passing attention to the area over the next few night shifts in an attempt to apprehend the persons responsible.

'Late one night, he was passing the area when he spotted a figure dressed in a high-visibility jacket stood on top of the tip.'

The magazine said that the officer believed the man was a ‘lookout’ and was ‘clearly not supposed to be on the site’.

It added: 'The officer called for backup from the force helicopter and a traffic unit came to assist with a zoom lens to get a closer look.

'Upon this closer inspection, it was discovered that the lookout was a scarecrow wearing a high-visibility vest.'

A spokeswoman for Cleveland Police said: 'We are unable to find details of the incident, or confirm whether it even occurred, as the information published by the magazine does not contain specifics and is from an anonymous source.'

'Crime in Hartlepool is down by 9 per cent thanks to the dedication of our officers.'

In Shropshire, two officers found themselves cursing a similar bungle when they were called out to rescue a soaking wet pensioner who turned out to be a scarecrow wearing a straw hat.

Two PCs were on their way home from a nightshift in Bridgnorth when a call came in from an off-duty sergeant saying he had spotted a pensioner struggling against the elements during a particularly violent storm.

The sergeant told HQ that he had seen the hunched OAP holding a walking stick as he plodded through the driving rain in fields near the village of Alveley at 6.30am, seven miles away from Bridgnorth, last month.

Worzel woes: A police sergeant was left red-faced after despatching two PCs to find a lost pensioner, who turned out be this scarecrow which had been entered into a village competition

The two PCs were re-routed to the village to 'track down' the lost pensioner.

But when they found a scarecrow wearing a straw hat, which was one of the entries in an annual village competition.

The fuming PCs radioed back to HQ to tell them they were 'going home' and to tell the sarge to 'go to Specsavers', it was revealed in Police magazine.

A police source, who asked not to be named, said: 'The two officers were not too happy with their sergeant.

'They were looking forward to the end of their shift, but instead ended up trudging through the fields in the driving rain only to find a scarecrow staring back at them.'
