Former Sunderland and Ipswich manager Roy Keane was back in the dugout on Friday night... and appeared to enjoy the experience.

Keane, currently the Republic of Ireland assistant manager, was all smiles when he appeared on the touchline for a charity match at League of Ireland Cobh Ramblers, the club which helped launch his professional playing career.

Keane took charge of a Cobh Ramblers XI for a match against a Springfield XI, which featured past League of Ireland stars like Patsy Freyne and Michael Devine.

Springfield took the lead when Luke Wilson fired past 41-year-old Mick Devine at St Colman’s Park but an own goal levelled the tie up at 1-1.

A penalty gave Keane's side the victory after current Ramblers assistant manager Anthony Wolfe was felled in the box before dusting himself off and scoring from 12 yards.

All funds were donated to the Cobh Hospital development.
