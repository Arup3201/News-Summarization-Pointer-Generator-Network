A California woman who started a program to teach hunting and other outdoor pursuits to children has begun receiving death threats from animal-rights activists.

Jen Cordaro, who calls herself 'Jen the Archer' on her Facebook page, started a program two months ago called #BringAKidHunting, which claims to teach children responsible hunting habits.

Cordaro's Facebook page, which includes photos of her and her young students in the field, has caught the attention of animal-rights activists, who want to stop all hunting in California.

Jen Cordaro, who calls herself 'Jen the Archer', started a program several months ago to teach hunting and other outdoor pursuits to children that has attracted the anger of animal-rights activists in California

The hunting and angling enthusiast has received dozens of messages including: 'I would not let my children near such a vile, sadistic murderer as this piece of human trash.' 

Another post said: 'Give me 5 minutes in a room with her and I would make sure she feels the same pain and cruelty she dished out!'

As well as angry comments on her social media pages, an online petition has been launched which calls Cordaro a murderer and demands that she stop hunting.

The Change.org petition accuses Cordaro of teaching children to become animal murderers.

'Cordaro claims to be someone who promotes wildlife conservation and all she does is kill innocent animals and post them on social media for the world to join her in celebrating murder,' writes Dusti Lee, who launched the petition on Wednesday.

'She brainwashes children into believing that murdering animals is a positive activity in the world and then helps them brag about their kills by turning to social media for the accolades of trophy pictures,' he writes.

The petition has so far received over 2000 signatures.

Cordaro told KNSD that the threats have made her uncomfortable. 'It's a little intimidating, I'm not going to lie. It's a little scary,' she said.

She has also received support as well, including one post that read: 'Keep it up and silence the haters.'

Parents of children she has taught have also come forward to offer her support. Shannon Caldwell told 10News that her daughter MacKenzie had a wonderful experience. 

'Not only hunting, they took her to an archery range, to lobster hooping, to learn how to shoot a gun; just all around fun. Kept her outdoors, she never touched her phone or other electronics around. It was overall one of the best weekends. She said it was like Christmas every day,' she said.

Ironically Cordaro used to be a vegetarian, but she says the local, sustainable food movement got her interested in harvesting her own meat.

'Being the eaters, I think its important to be responsible meat eaters. Hunting is, in my opinion, the most responsible way for me to go and acquire meat,' she told XETV.

Despite the online abuse, she hasn't contacted police about the threats and hopes things will die down.

'I'm not going to run. I'm right here and I'm going to stay here and advocate for outdoors and hunters and for kids in the outdoors. That's the bottom line,' she said.
