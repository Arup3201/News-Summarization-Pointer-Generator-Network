A man whose six-year-old son was killed in the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre was scheduled to appear on Wednesday in Connecticut Superior Court on larceny and other charges.

Neil Heslin, the father of Jesse Lewis - a six-year-old victim of the Newtown shooting - was scheduled to appear in Connecticut Superior Court today on charges stemming from bad checks he allegedly tried to pass from July 2011.

Heslin, who has lobbied for stricter gun-control laws, faces at least three charges that he issued bad checks to pay for building materials for the construction company he owns.

In two other cases, Heslin allegedly tried to pass a check from a closed account, in one case for more than $1,000 in home heating oil, and another for $102 in repairs on a vehicle at a local tire shop, according to the News-Times of Danbury.

Heslin's legal troubles have led to criticism from his pro-gun opponents.

Superior Court Judge Frank Iannotti ordered Heslin to explain on Wednesday why he was not in court on April 15.

Heslin
was part of a contingent from Newtown that was meeting with U.S. 
senators that week, asking them to pass legislation that would have 
included universal background checks for gun purchases.

Heslin was asked by the News-Times if he thought his legal troubles might undermine his advocacy efforts.

'I
never gave it much thought. I guess you can look at it either way," he 
told the newspaper.

'If there's something to talk about, people are 
going to talk about it, good or bad, no matter what.'

Heslin's son, Jesse, was among 26 people shot dead inside Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14.
