Jamie DeWolf, the great-grandson of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, has come out with new explosive claims against the church and its controversial founder.

And it's not pretty.

'My family sees Scientology as absolute poison,' says Jamie DeWolf. 'It’s a dangerous cult.'

He says that the church's influence undoubtedly lead to the break up of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes' family as well

DeWolf’s great-grandfather, L. Ron Hubbard, created Scientology, and his
 grandfather, L. Ron Hubbard Jr., was a high-ranking member for most of 
his life.

'But he became disgusted about what he was seeing behind the curtain, so
 he left,' DeWolf tells the New York Post. 'For the rest of his life, he was hunted. And he
 couldn’t even have a relationship with his father.'

DeWolf says the Scientology founder 'became more and more unhinged in his last 
days. He was lost in his own little wonderland, 
surrounded by this armada, this dark security force. He was totally 
lost.'

When DeWolf was 8, he found a picture of his great-grandfather in a book about
 cults.

'Then I started to ask questions,' he said. 'Then I 
started to learn about this darker legacy.'

He claims that the church is dangerous cult

Mr DeWolf said that he never met his great-grandfather and had never been a member of the church

DeWolf, who was raised Baptist Christian, was warned about publicly admitting his connection to the group.

'My uncle said it was like poking a sleeping dog,' DeWolf said. 'The 
Scientologists didn’t know who I was or where I was, so why should I 
take the risk? My family was very wary.'

When he finally did come forward to share his story, DeWolf claims the Scientologists hunted him down.

'I had private 
investigators following me,' he said. 'It’s possible my phone line had been tapped.
 They fight nasty. Part of it actually is a certain malicious glee in 
going after their targets.'

He said it was definitely the cause for the split between Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes.

'The more [Katie] saw behind the curtain,” he’s said, “the more horrified that she probably was.'

Mr DeWolf is grandson of Ron DeWolf, L. Ron Hubbard's eldest son, pictured left holding Jamie's mother

DeWolf said he has met people over the years that have shared similar stories with him.

'I’ve met people who’ve had 20 years of their lives utterly destroyed by 
this cult,' he said. 'They have relatives they can’t speak to any more, 
lost their kids, lost their house. It’s become very serious to me.

For 
me to even speak out on my own genetic legacy and to be aware that I 
could absolutely threatened and hunted for that, that really emboldened 
me. I’m not gonna die with these secrets and they should be exposed.
