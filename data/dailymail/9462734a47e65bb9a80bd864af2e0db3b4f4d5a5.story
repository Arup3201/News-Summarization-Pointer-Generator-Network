Kevin Mitchell, pictured, threatened to slit his victim's throat before raping her in her own apartment in New York on September 19, 2013

A convicted rapist sentenced to 14 years  has been granted a marriage licence to wed his long-term girlfriend so he can receive conjugal visits while in prison.

Kevin Mitchell violently attacked the 30-year-old woman inside her own apartment in New York in the early hours of the morning, threatening her that he had a gun and would slit her throat.

Mitchell, 34, pleaded guilty to one count of Rape in the First Degree at Manhattan Supreme Court on February 11, 2015. 

However, instead of being sent straight to a state penitentiary in upper New York State immediately, Mitchell was granted a one-month stay in Rikers Island so he could get married to Tyneka Hudson. 

Ms Hudson told the New York Daily News following her would-be husband's sentence: 'I'm going to stay by his side. He's a good man.'

Prosecutors claim that Mitchell followed his victim into her apartment at 5.30am on the day of the attack. 

However, Ms Hudson questions the verdict. She said: 'No one knows the real story. Only she and him know. I can’t say he did it. I can’t say he didn’t do it. He told me he didn’t rape the lady. He said they were drinking and he put a hickey on her. I don’t know what he was doing in her apartment.' 

Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr said: 'This lengthy prison sentence reflects the extremely violent nature of this attack, in which Kevin Mitchell raped a woman in her own home.

'I would like to thank the survivor for coming forward, and my office’s Sex Crimes prosecutors for ensuring that this predator will serve years behind bars.' 

Prosecutor Siobhan Carty told Manhattan Supreme Court that Mitchell surreptitiously entered the woman's apartment on September 19, 2013 at 5.30am and threatened her with a knife and said he had a gun. 

After the attack, the victim rang 911 and NYPD's Warrant Squad arrested Mitchell four days later.

Ms Carty read the victim's statement into the court record in advance of Mitchell's sentencing. 

She said on behalf of the victim: 'This man has completely ruined my life. I have tried to rationalise what I could have done in my life to have deserved what happened to me. The only conclusion that I have come up with is that some people in this world are truly terrible.'

'I cannot understand why the man did this to me. Why he told me he would kill me if I didn’t do what he said.

'I do not know if he raped me because I only had $24, or if that was the initial reason that he broke into my apartment. If he had broken into my apartment to assault me, then why did he make me talk to him for so long?

'I was trapped in my own home for what felt like forever talking to this man and not knowing if he was going to kill me or my dog — he made it clear to me that he was very capable of both.' 

Mitchell has been told he can remain on Rikers Island, pictured, until next month so he can marry his girlfriend Tyneka Hudson and receive conjugal visits when he is sent to a prison in upstate New York

The statement added: 'I gave him so many chances to leave. I told him multiple times that if he left right then nothing bad would happen. He raped me anyways.' 

It is claimed that Mitchell was drinking at the time of the attack and told his victim 'I'll slit your throat. This is going to happen either way.' 

As well as receiving a 14-year jail term, Mitchell was ordered to undergo 10 years' post release supervision.
