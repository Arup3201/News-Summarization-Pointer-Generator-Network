The Formula One car in which Ayrton Senna made his breakthrough is expected to fetch £750,000 when it goes under the hammer.

The motorsport icon - whose life was recently immortalised for a new generation with the award-winning film documentary called Senna - made his F1 debut in 1984 season, in which he drove this 650bhp Toleman TG184-2 car.

And it was the first car to showcase the tragic Brazilian’s extraordinary talent on the big stage, when he finished second in a legendary rain-soaked Monaco Grand Prix.

Legend: Collectors are expected to flock to the auction of the first ever Formula One car raced by Ayrton Senna

Skills: Senna made his F1 debut in 1984 season, driving this Toleman TG184-2 race car, in which he finished to second in a rain-soaked Monaco Grand Prix

In control: Ayrton Senna became a legend for his wet weather abilities, seen here in action during the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix in Monte Carlo

Senna qualified for the race in a lowly 13th, lagging 2.34 seconds behind his future nemesis Alain Prost on pole.

But despite his low starting place and difficult conditions, Senna, then 24, raced through the grid and finished second thanks to a number of ‘magnificent’ manoeuvres. 

Murray Walker, commenting at the time for the BBC, described Senna’s race in the Toleman car as ‘sensational’.

The
awful weather led to the race - which was the sixth of the season - 
being cancelled after 31 laps with racers collecting half points.

Prost was victorious, but had the race been allowed to continue Senna would have stormed past him within a few laps.

Tragedy: Senna's astonishing career was cut short when he was killed in a crash in 1994 during the San Marino Grand Prix. His death sparked major safety improvements to cars which had offered little protection

The brave performance launched the rookie South American on to the big stage with one commentator confidently saying he would go on to be a future world champion.

He finished his debut season in ninth position with the Toleman helping him to 13 points.

Senna went on to win the F1 world championship three times but was tragically killed in 1994 during the San Marino Grand Prix.

His first had a tiny 1.5-litre engine but was fitted with a huge turbo to give it a staggering 650bhp.

It has been owned by a private syndicate for 16 years and underwent a full restoration in 2009 and is perfect for historic racing and track days.

It will be sold at The Spring Sale hosted by Silverstone Auctions on May 16 - and is expected to fetch around £750,000.

Silverstone Auctions has been described the F1 car as ‘the stuff of legends’ and a ‘truly unique piece of automotive history’.

Nick Whale, managing director, Silverstone Auctions, said: ‘We are thrilled to bring this iconic race car to auction as it’s undoubtedly one of the most important lots we’ve ever offered.

Cutting edge: Under the skin, the Toleman Formula One car raced by Ayrton Senna was state-of-the-art in 1984

Power: The car has a relatively small a 1.5-litre engine but was boosted to a staggering 650bhp with the aid of a huge turbo charger

Down force: The Toleman TG184-2 race car has two rear spoilers to help force the rear wheels into the track as they put down around 650bhp

‘Senna mania is reaching fever pitch and rightly so as he’s considered by many as the greatest F1 driver we’ve ever seen.

‘It goes without saying that this will be one of the star attractions at the sale as it’s a very rare chance to own a much sought after piece of motorsport and Ayrton Senna history.’

Keith Collantine, editor of leading motorsport website F1Fanatic.co.uk, added: ‘The images of him sliding the Toleman around Monaco, churning plumes of spray from its tyres as he hunted down race leader Alain Prost, are a part of F1 folklore.

‘Almost 30 years later, it looks a crude beast by modern standards but in Senna’s hands it was capable of tremendous things.’

During a career tragically cut short, Senna displayed an unsurpassed talent for racing.

The Brazilian scored the most consecutive pole positions, eight in one single purple patch between 1988 Spanish Grand Prix until the 1989 United States Grand Prix.

Senna also won the most poles at the same Grand Prix: eight at the San Marino Grand Prix between 1985 and 1991 and again in 1994.

Another amazing statistic shows Senna's relentless consistency, scoring the most consecutive starts from front row: 24 between the 1988 German Grand Prix and the 1989 Australian Grand Prix.

And to underline the three-times world champion's dominance, he also holds the record for the most races lead from start to finish, with 19 in total.
