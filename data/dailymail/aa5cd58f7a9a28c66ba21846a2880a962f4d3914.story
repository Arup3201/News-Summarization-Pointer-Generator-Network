A newly released surveillance photo shows a bride in the silver sequined cocktail dress that she wore to her wedding last week - and which she still had on when police discovered her stabbed to death in her bathtub only days later.

The release of the image comes as police and FBI continue to pore over more than 100 tips in an effort to locate Estrella Carrera's husband, 30-year-old Arnoldo Jimenez, who was charged in the killing.

More than 30 law enforcement agencies had joined federal agents in the search for Jimenez, who married Carrera on Friday and allegedly stabbed her to death just hours later.

Investigators would not reveal in which states they are looking for Jimenez, only saying that it was ‘all over the country.’

‘We are following every lead, no matter where it takes us,’ said Captain Joseph Ford, of the Burbank Police Department.

Authorities began looking for Jimenez soon after Carrera's family reported that she failed to pick up her two children, ages two and ten, Saturday as she had arranged. The family had been unable to reach Carrera or Jimenez, so they asked police to check on her at her apartment in the suburb of Burbank.

That is when the 26-year-old’s body was found in the bathtub, still clothed in the party dress she also may have worn at her wedding ceremony at Chicago's City Hall. There were no signs of forced entry into Carrera’s apartment, according to investigators.

That day, the bride's family received a haunting phone call from a sister of her new husband, who told them he had called her weeping and said that he had left his bride bleeding after a ‘bad fight.’

Most of Carrera's family disapproved of her three–year relationship with Jimenez, even though he was the father of her two-year-old son.

Jimenez had hit and bruised Carrera in the past, according to Carrera’s older sister, Jazmin. Police also said family members reported incidents of violence while the couple was dating. 

Jazmin Carrera described Jimenez as ‘very possessive’ and jealous. She said she does not understand why her sister married the 30-year-old in what seemed like a rushed ceremony that the bride had kept secret from almost everyone.

Jazmin Carrera received a text message from her sister Friday, inviting her to join them and their friends at a Mexican restaurant and a nightclub to celebrate the nuptials.

She chose not to attend.

‘It was just all of a sudden,’ Jazmin Carrera said. ‘She didn't give us enough notice.’

The pair were last seen around 4am on Saturday morning, according to officials.

On Sunday, relatives heard about the phone call from Jimenez's sister, who said that when she tried to call her brother back, he would not pick up, according to Jazmin Carrera.

Timeline: Police believe Carrera was killed shortly after she and Jimenez returned to her apartment in Burbank on Saturday

Police in Burbank said they are aware of the account and are looking into it.

Authorities made a plea to Jimenez to turn himself in ‘for the sake of his family and especially his children,’ Ford said.

According to officials, Jimenez was previously arrested for domestic violence in another city in a case that did not involve Carrera. Police do not know what Jimenez does for a living, although he was last known to be driving a black 2006 Maserati with Illinois license plate L641441.

Since the killing likely took place only hours after the couple went to Carrera's apartment, police said the suspect had plenty of time to flee the metropolitan area, or even the state.

Investigators do not believe Jimenez is a danger to others, although they say they have no way of knowing his current state of mind.
