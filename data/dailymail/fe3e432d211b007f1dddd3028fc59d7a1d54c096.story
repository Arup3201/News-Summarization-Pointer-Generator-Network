Bryan Ferry’s youngest son was last night fighting for his life after a horrific head-on car crash just days before Christmas.

It took more than 45 minutes for firemen to extract Merlin, 24, from the wreckage of his car after the three-vehicle horror smash in a country lane on Monday evening.

His 69-year-old father was believed to be at his hospital bedside with the rest of his family yesterday as Merlin remained in a ‘critical’ condition. The former Marlborough College pupil suffered multiple fractures and a head injury in the crash in Shropshire, which left his silver Volvo saloon unidentifiable.

One of the other vehicles in the tangled wreck had erupted in flames while Merlin was still trapped in his car, but a passer-by was able to quickly put out the dangerous blaze.

Merlin was taken by ambulance to the major trauma centre at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

The guitarist, who has performed with his singer father, was said to have regained consciousness yesterday morning but was in a daze believing he had missed Christmas. He was later sent to theatre for a life-saving operation and is currently being treated at the hospital’s critical care unit.

Merlin, who narrowly escaped jail in 2013 after he was found carrying a knife for a second time, is one of four sons the Roxy Music star has with his ex-wife, former model Lucy Helmore.

Yesterday, Merlin’s eldest brother, Eton-educated Otis, informed his followers of the crash and updated them on his sibling’s condition via his public Instagram page.

After uploading a picture of the crash scene, he said: ‘He had a head-on collision, has lots of broken bones and is having an operation on his heart as we speak.

The crash, which took place on the A458 near Cressage, Shropshire, left Merlin's silver Volvo saloon (left) looking like 'a mangled box of tin'. The wreckage also involved a red Mercedes (right)

‘He was conscious before he went into theatre and his biggest concern was that he had missed Christmas! He is in the best possible hospital for this type of procedure.’

Otis, who is master of the South Shropshire Hunt and has in the past been arrested for his pro-hunting activism, also thanked firefighters for freeing his brother from the wreck.

He wrote on Twitter: ‘Thank you for extracting my brother alive from what looks like a mangled box of tin. We are all continuing to pray.’

Merlin had been travelling along the A458 about half a mile north-west of the village of Cressage, in Shropshire, at the time of the collision.

His car and a red Mercedes, which was travelling in the opposite direction, had collided head-on at around 6.40pm.

The 49-year-old Mercedes driver from Kidderminster escaped with minor injuries.

A third vehicle, a Scania lorry, which was travelling in the same direction as the Mercedes was also involved but little damage was caused to it. The driver was uninjured.

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘On arrival, crews found two cars that had suffered massive damage after a collision. The trapped man was in the first car. He suffered multiple fractures to his legs, pelvis, left arm and had a head injury.

‘Working with firefighters, ambulance staff very carefully freed him. He was assessed at the scene and had splints put in place along with advanced pain relief before being taken to the major trauma centre.’

Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘Crews worked hard for 45 minutes to free the man which was a difficult extrication due to the impact involved.’

Police are investigating the incident and are appealing for witnesses. No arrests have been made.

Ferry’s 21-year marriage to Merlin’s mother ended in divorce in 2003. His second marriage to PR executive Amanda Sheppard, who is 38 years his junior, also ended in divorce earlier this year.

The couple had separated in August last year after being married for two years.
