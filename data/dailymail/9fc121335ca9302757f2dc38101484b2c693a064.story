Outrage: 3AW presenter Dee Dee Dunleavy is the self-styled queen of Melbourne radio

An Australian radio DJ has caused uproar after implying readers should boycott Nigella Lawson's cook books until she 'makes a stand against domestic violence'

Dee Dee Dunleavy made the comments on her 3AW blog after pictures appeared in a Sunday tabloid that claimed to show Nigella being throttled by her husband, Charles Saatchi, during an argument at a London restaurant.

Nigella has since been photographed leaving their West London home with suitcases before police revealed that they were likely to question Saatchi 
about the incident.

In yet another controversy to engulf Australian radio in recent weeks, Dunleavy - the self-proclaimed Queen of Melbourne Radio - was forced to deny she was 'victim blaming' after receiving a 'torrent of abuse' from angry Nigella fans.

'It’s hard to look a the photos of Nigella Lawson, her eyes wide with panic, her husband Charles Saatchi’s hand wrapped around her throat, without feeling revulsion and disbelief,' she initially wrote. 'The ‘Domestic Goddess’ is not flirty and fun as fans of her cooking shows know her, but fearful.'

She went on to ask why Nigella then posted a 'picture of a buttered, toasted bagel on her official Twitter page, as though nothing else was on her mind but food' while the pictures of the apparent row were going viral online.

'That’s not the response we were after, Nigella,' she added. 'We think you are strong, beautiful and successful [... and] we don’t like to think of you cowering from a thug. A man so boldly abusive he had no qualms about attacking you in public.

'Nigella, like it or not, you’re a beacon for women from all walks of life. If you want us to buy your books and watch your shows on how to run our kitchens, then we need you to make a stand on domestic violence.'

Mr Saatchi is almost certain to be questioned by detectives within weeks

Her comments triggered a groundswell of fury among Nigella fans across the world.

One wrote on the 3AW website: 'VICTIMS need support NOT more thuggery at the hands of Radio jerks ( jocks). How dare you presume the higher moral ground. When will Australian radio clean up its act and image - it's a national disgrace that rubbish like this is allowed.'

Another
added: 'I never comment on random internet articles unless I feel 
really strongly, but this article has really offended me - who are you 
to tell a victim of domestic violence how she should and shouldn't 
behave as a victim?'

They
went on: 'She didn't ask for this to happen, she owes nobody anything. 
It is her husband's fault for hurting her - where is the blame being 
placed on him and telling him that we'll stop providing him with revenue
until he ceases to be a violent partner? Awful.'

Dunleavy later sought to dilute her words in a followup statement.

'First
and foremost, my wish for Nigella Lawson is that she is safe and well, 
and as far away from her beastly husband as possible,' the 3AW presenter
wrote.

'The fact that I have copped a 
torrent of abuse today for urging her to take a stand against domestic 
violence pales into insignificance compared to what she must be going 
through.'

Denial: In yet another controversy to thrust Australian radio under the global spotlight in recent weeks, the self-proclaimed Queen of Melbourne Radio was forced to issue a statement denying she was 'victim blaming' after receiving a 'torrent of abuse' from angry Nigella fans

The alleged incident occurred at an upmarket restaurant in London's Mayfair a week ago last Sunday.

Multimillionaire Saatchi was caught on 
camera clutching his third wife's neck as they sat 
outside their favourite eatery.

The couple, who are thought to be 
worth £128million, had just finished eating outdoors at their favourite 
seafood restaurant Scott’s when Mr Saatchi is reported to have started a
heated and angry exchange with his wife.

Miss Lawson, 53, looked tearful as he grabbed her neck four times, first with his left hand and then both.

As
he held her neck, they clutched hands across the table before Mr 
Saatchi tweaked her nose and used both wrists to push her face.

Afterwards, Miss Lawson dabbed her tearful eyes in a napkin as he tapped his cigarettes impatiently upon the table.

game'

She then gulped a whole glass of wine before appearing to attempt to pacify him with a trembling voice. During the attempted reconciliation, she leaned over the table and kissed his right cheek.

Today, Saatchi dismissed the incident as no more than a 'playful tiff', insisting that they were having an 'intense argument' and the TV cook was
only crying because she hates it when they row.

It is not the first time Australian radio DJs have sparked international outrage in recent months.

Last week, 6PR DJ Howard Sattler was sacked for asking Australian prime minister Julia Gillard if her husband is gay simply because he is a hairdresser.

And a week before that, it was revealed that Michael Christian, one of the DJs behind last year's prank call on the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital that lead to a nurse's suicide, not only kept his job but won a top award for his stunt as well.
