Leaping, frolicking lambs are an everyday site on farms.

But the Prince of Wales spotted a much older wooly jumper during a visit to a Tasmanian holding, where he was learning about Australia's world-leading wool trade.

Charles, visiting the Thornbury family's Leenavale Sheep Stud as part of his six-day tour down under with his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, watched as an adult sheep almost bounded straight out of a pen in its desperation to follow his fluffy friends into the shearing sheds.

The Prince was visiting the farm to learn how the Thornbury family produce highly-prized merino wool, used to make luxury knitwear, jumpers and cloth for Italian suits - and even tried his hand at fleece-throwing.

He was sporting a grey pin-stripe double-breasted suit by Anderson & Sheppard, made, appropriately, from a rare quality of Australian Merino wool.

Charles did well to keep the mud off his expensive trousers when he was taken into a pen by Brent Thornbury who, along with brother Jason, is the fourth generation of his family to run the sheep stud.

The farm, located at Sorell, some 20km east of Hobart,  covers 5,000 hectares and has around 12,000 merino sheep.

Alongside farm manager Brent Thornbury, the Duke of Cornwall watched as the sheep were moved along a narrow run into a pen before going into a shed where they would be sheared.

One enthusiastic farm dog called Zig, an Australian kelpie, jumped up and ran on to the backs of the sheep, which then began leaping into the air.

Inside the shearing shed, which had a corrugated iron roof and smelled strongly of sheep droppings, the Prince and Mr Thornbury watched shearers expertly snip off fleeces in three minutes.

Lucy Byers, 35, was gathering up the wool and skilfully tossing it on to a table to be graded by other workers.

Charles tried his hand at throwing the fleece and sheepishly said afterwards: 'I didn't do it to well.'
