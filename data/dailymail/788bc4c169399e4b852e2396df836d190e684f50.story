A Council is spending £10,000 on ‘motivational’ text messages to overweight people, telling them to ‘walk to the shops’ or ‘eat slightly smaller portions’.

Stoke-on-Trent City Council’s bizarre scheme sends daily texts to obese people with a short message of ‘advice and support’.

They include statements such as: ‘Why not walk to the shops more often’, and ‘Keep a check on snacks and drinks’. But the idea has been condemned by critics as ‘a gimmick’ that ‘states the obvious’.

Tackling the problem: The inspirational messages will be sent out every day to 500 participants during the 10-week scheme (file picture)

The region has been crippled with an obesity epidemic, with the local NHS forking out more than £50 million-a-year to battle the problem.

Critics of the scheme today slammed the initiative as 'ridiculous'

Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance 
said: ‘Council chiefs shouldn’t play nanny with taxpayers’ money. It’s 
difficult to see how these texts are anything other than a ridiculous 
waste of cash. ’

But City Councillor Adrian Knapper said: 'We are recruiting 500 residents to take part in the 10-week feasibility study which will see participants receive daily advice and support through their mobile phones.

'Obesity has reached epidemic levels across Stoke-on-Trent, where an estimated 28 per cent of adults are obese.

'The new text message service will offer support to adults who want to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.'

Motivation: Examples of the inspirational messages people on the scheme will receive when it begins at the end of this month

GP practice manager Claire Woodfint, 32, who once tipped the scales at 23 stone before losing almost half of her bodyweight, is backing the idea.

Claire commented: 'Text messages would have helped me.

'I lost weight through diet rather than exercise and if I had got something to motivate me it would have helped.

'It stops you from losing sight of what you are trying to achieve.'

Adrian Knapper, Cabinet Member for 
Health, Well Being and Culture, said the initiative was using tried and 
tested techniques from both the public and private sectors.

He said: 'We have over 100,000 people in our region who are overweight or obese.

'Our
 Public Health Team are using the texting technique as just one part of a
 comprehensive set of public health activities to help and support 
people in changing their lifestyles, through taking more exercise and 
improving their diets.

'This
 approach has already been used very effectively by a network of 
clinicians across the UK in prompting people with a range of medical 
problems.

'Private 
sector behaviour change experts Slimming World also used this technique 
as part of their personal weight change programme. We are learning from 
the best in public and private sector practise.

'It
 costs £10,000 on average to perform just one intervention operation to 
help people manage their weight - and the costs of obesity for the local
 NHS in terms of increased levels of disability, disease and early death
 are frightening - £50 million a year.

'Our
 programme means people who already want to lose weight and have signed 
up with us to get support will receive a cheap and effective nudge to 
help them keep them motivated.'
