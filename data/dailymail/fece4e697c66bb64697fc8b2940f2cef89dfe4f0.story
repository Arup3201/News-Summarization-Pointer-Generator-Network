It is not every day you see a man walking around a cathedral square with a smile on his face and a full-grown sheep on his shoulders.

Sinister-looking black-clad riders dance stallions on their hind legs in the middle of a 20,000-strong crowd. The bravest or most foolhardy revellers dash forward to touch the horses' hearts for luck.

The annual fiesta of Sant Joan in the ancient city of Ciutadella, on Menorca's west coast, features many bizarre rituals. Strangers fuelled by pomada, the local version of gin and bitter lemon, pelt you with hazelnuts (it's a sign of love, apparently).

If you jump three times over a bonfire, you can turn a bad year into a good one (useful in the Spanish economic climate).

When it comes to celebrating the summer solstice, Menorca is the place to be. 

Sant Joan is the Catalan name of St John the Baptist and we're celebrating his June birthday, although the fiesta has much older pagan origins.

Horseplay: The festival of Sant Joan is a major tradition on Menorca, with equine stunts to the fore

Menorca is the poorest and least known of the Balearic islands. We all know about Mallorca with its many hotels and reputation, in places such as Magaluf, for alcohol-fuelled package tour excesses.

Ibiza has the coolest clubs and celebrity second-homers such as James Blunt, Liam Gallagher, Jade Jagger and Elle Macpherson.

Mellow little Menorca is the Balearics' shy relation, positively introverted in comparison with its neighbours - and all the better for it. At last, I've found a holiday destination in the western Mediterranean that is almost entirely unspoilt by 60 years of mass tourism.

The first charter flights landed here in 1953, but when you arrive by air in the capital, Mahon (or Mao in Catalan) nowadays, it comes as a welcome shock to see that almost the entire island is made up of fields and woodland, with just two small cities and a few pods of white villas scattered around the coastline.

In 1993, UNESCO declared the island one of the world's 400 'biosphere reserves'.

Curiously, the Menorcans have Generalissimo Franco to thank for this.

In retribution for the little island's Republican stance during the Spanish Civil War, the fascist dictator spent the next 36 years denying Menorca access to public building funds.

As a happy result, it escaped the high-rise concrete epidemic that blighted the mainland costas.

A quaint sort of calm: The Menorcan capital Ciutadella sits prettily on the west coast of the island

Menorca is just half the size of the Isle of Wight. In the middle lies El Toro, a 1,000 ft hill with a church, a Franciscan convent and tremendous views.

To the east lies Mahon with its deep natural harbour, imposing Georgian buildings and narrow cobbled alleyways. In the west, you can glimpse Ciutadella.

The varietyof buildings in Mahon reflects the list of invaders, including Turkish pirates, who have invaded and occupied its streets down the centuries. Our own Admiral John Byng was executed by firing squad for losing Menorca to the French in 1756.

Georgian architecture apart, our legacy was gin - distilled to this day by Xoriguer on the harbour in Mahon.

Busy resorts like Cala Galdana, Arenal d'en Castell and Punta Prima have enough activities to satisfy even the most lively, though for the first couple of days I found it hard to choose between flopping by the pool and basking on the sands.

Most of the best beaches, such as Cala Macarella, Son Saura and Cala Pregonda, are tucked away in isolated coves along the 116-mile coastline. The Camí de Cavalls, an ancient bridleway, encircles the island, and can be explored on foot, by bicycle or, naturally, on horseback.

Take a walk with me: Ciutadella is an inviting place for an evening meal or a gentle stroll when dusk falls

Menorca bears the brunt of winds sweeping in from the Atlantic and Fornells, on the north coast, which is the best place for sailing and windsurfing. It is also an attractive town with boutiques, a craft market and restaurants.

Inexpensive Sa Taula (+34 619 432 291) has folk music and tapas such as courgette carpaccio, along with mussels poached in port.

The seafront in Fornells has plenty of fish restaurants and you might consider spending €40 to €60 (£31-£47 on a feast of caldereta de langosta, a spicy lobster stew. Fishermen used to eat this at sea because lobster was the only seafood that had no commercial value.

These days, sadly, the lobster in question may be sourced from Cornwall or Cardigan Bay, so I'd recommend a short trip along the coast to the bistro El Castillo (+34 971 35855) at Addaia for the finest fresh fish, at more reasonable prices.

For a romantic off-season break or a full-on family beach holiday, unspoilt Menorca is hard to beat. 

Sovereign Luxury Travel (0843 770 4526, www.sovereign.com) offers seven nights at the four-star Audax Spa and Wellness Centre in Cala Galdana from £569 per person half-board, including Gatwick flights, airport lounge access and transfers.

Menorca is smaller and far less developed than its big neighbour Mallorca

It owes its lack of sprawl to General Franco, who held a grudge against it

The old city of Ciutadella, on its west coast, is one of the main attractions
