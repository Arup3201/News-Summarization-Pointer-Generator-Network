Manchester United will rebuff any attempt by Real Madrid to sign Adnan Januzaj.

The European champions have added the young Belgian to their summer shopping list but United insist the 19-year-old is not for sale at any price after signing him to a long-term contract last winter.

It was a breakthrough season for Januzaj at Old Trafford, having debuted for the side in September and making himself a key member of the first team.

Wanted: Adnan Januzaj is reportedly a target for Real Madrid this summer

On duty: The young Belgian is currently away with his national team at the World Cup

He is currently away on international duty with Belgium at the World Cup, where he was capped for the first time in their final warm-up game Tunisia in June.

And the youngster was an unused substitute during their 2-1 victory over Algeria in the first game of the competition.

He will be hoping to return to Old Trafford and continue his progression under new boss Louis van Gaal next campaign.

Breakthrough: It's been a superb season for the 19-year-old after making his debut in September
