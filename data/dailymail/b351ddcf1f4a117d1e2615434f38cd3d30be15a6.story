Arsenal pair Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski join Chelsea's Andre Schurrle in the Germany squad for games against Argentina and Scotland next month.

Joachim Low's side face the South Americans on September 3 in a friendly repeat of the World Cup final before squaring up to Scotland in the first Euro 2016 qualifier four days later.

Miroslav Klose, Per Mertesacker and Philipp Lahm have retired from international football but Low has named 18 World Cup winners in his squad and is able to welcome back Mario Gomez and Marco Reus.

Fiorentina striker Gomez and Borussia Dortmund midfielder Reus missed the summer triumph through injury. 

Gomez was behind Klose in the pecking order and Low said: 'Mario really wanted to return to the team and his nomination is absolutely deserved. When he is fit he will strengthen our qualities in attack.'

Reus, who has been linked with Barcelona and Manchester United this summer, was forced out of the World Cup after injuring his ankle in his side's final warm-up match.

Low said: 'I am extremely happy that Marco has overcome his injury. I know he has a few tournaments left to play to cause a furore,'

Germany play Argentina in Dusseldorf before entertaining the Scots in Dortmund to kick off qualifying Group D. Ireland, Poland, Georgia and Gibraltar complete the line-up. 

Stuttgart defender Antonio Ruediger, with one cap to his name, is also called up by Low. Bayern Munich midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger and Valencia's Shkodran Mustafi are sidelined.
