The first pill to treat a dangerous type of blood clot could be available on the NHS in weeks.

Every year in the UK, about 36,000 patients suffer from pulmonary embolism (PE) â€“ a clot on the lungs.

The condition is usually treated using injections of the blood-thinning drugs Heparin and Warfarin, which requires constant blood tests to check the drug levels.

But with Rivaroxaban, the first in a new generation of anti-clotting pills that can treat PE, no injections or blood tests are required.

The drug will initially be prescribed for 12 months.

It has been given the green light by safety regulators in Scotland and is being assessed for the NHS in England.

PE is caused when part of a clot that has formed in the legs or pelvis becomes dislodged and gets stuck in the main artery of the lung.

The pressure this puts on the lung and heart triggers breathing difficulties, chest pain and palpitations and can lead to sudden death.

Lifeblood, a charity that campaigns to raise awareness of blood clots, said the new drug would be a great option.
