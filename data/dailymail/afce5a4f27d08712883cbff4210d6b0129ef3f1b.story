Oregon authorities planned to resume the search Thursday for a Gresham woman who disappeared two days ago under suspicious circumstances.

Police say the husband of 21-year-old Whitney Heichel reported her missing Tuesday after she did not show up for work at her job at a nearby Starbucks in the Portland suburb.

Her car was found late Tuesday morning in a Wood Village parking lot with the passenger side window smashed.

Investigators believe the car was seen at Dodge Park north of Sandy and at Larch Mountain in the Columbia River Gorge.

KATU reports that on Wednesday at the park, investigators found broken window glass and examined tire trucks in the mud.

Clint Heichel says he has no idea why his wife never made it to work.

Gresham police have called Heichel's 
disappearance "suspicious" and fear they are in a race against time to 
find her, ABC reports.

'Right now we have 24 detectives working on it,' 
Gresham Police Department spokesman Lt. Claudio Grandjean said. 'We want
to be able to jump on leads we have right away. The colder those leads 
get, the more difficult it becomes.'

Fears: Six hours after she left home, her car was found with a smashed window in a parking lot

Hunt: Clint alerted authorities after she failed to turn up for work on Tuesday in Gresham, Oregon

Whitney Heichel left her apartment, 
which she shares with her husband, in Gresham, Oregon at 6.45am on 
Tuesday for a 7am shift but failed to turn up to work.

Six hours later, her SUV was found 
with a smashed window in a Walmart parking lot four miles from her home -
and police learned it had been seen at a gas station in the hours in 
between.

Friends said that a gas station 
attendant claimed the vehicle had been driven by a man, who was acting 
'suspicious and hurried', as Heichel sat in the passenger seat.

Mr Heichel, told Fox 12 that he 
learned of his wife's disappearance when her manager at Starbucks called
to say she had not arrived for her shift.

Abandoned: Her black 1999 Ford Explorer was found in a WalMart parking lot four miles from her home with a window smashed. It looked as if it had been rummaged through, friends said

Concerns: Police confirmed that her SUV was seen at a gas station before the vehicle was found in a car park

'She got dressed this morning, normal everything. Kissed me goodbye, said goodbye,' he said on Tuesday.

'(At) about 8:15 her boss called me 
and said, "Hey, I was just curious, did Whitney decide to be sick or not
feeling well? Have you seen her or talked to her?"' he told KATU.

Mr Heichel tried calling and texting her, but she did not respond.

Worried, he drove to her parents' 
home and then to a hospital in the area, as well as calling family and 
friends to see if anyone knew of her whereabouts.

When they could provide no further 
information, he called police to report her missing at 9.56am, and 
friends and family began distributing flyers and searching for her.

Detectives learned that her vehicle, a
black 1999 Ford Explorer, was seen and her ATM card was used at a gas 
station three miles from her home at 9.14am.

Details: Family and friends have been handing out flyers in the area in the hopes of gathering information

Her missing poster claims an 
attendant said she was in the passenger seat next to a man, who was 
'acting suspicious and hurried'. It adds that he was driving the car and
bought a small amount of gas, but police could not confirm this.

At 1pm, family and friends looking 
for Heichel found her vehicle, with the passenger window smashed, at a 
Walmart in Wood Village, around four miles from her home.

It appeared as if someone had rummaged through the car, according to her missing poster.

'The passenger side window was busted
out, the backseats were down, there was mud on her tires, which it 
wasn't that way the night before,' Clint Heichel said.

'It just is weird that we found her truck, completely off the path that she would take to go to work.'

He added: 'Anyone who has a loved one
or is married knows if your spouse goes missing and there's no word... I
don't know what to say, I don't know what to think, I don't know what 
to do.'

Gresham police said that there is 
surveillance video showing the SUV at the gas station, but the video is 
poor quality and detectives are unable to see who is driving the car.

Police have called her disappearance suspicious and continue to follow leads, Sgt. Claudio Grandjean said.

Family and friends continue to search for the young woman, setting up Facebook groups and handing out fliers across the area.
