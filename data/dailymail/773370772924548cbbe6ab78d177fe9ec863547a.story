It is the most famous battle in English history - its date of 1066 learned by generations of schoolchildren.

So suggestions that the official site of the Battle of Hastings - and an expensive visitor facility - may be in the wrong place have long been treated as little short of heresy.

Tonight, however, a team of archaeologists led by Sir Tony Robinson will support claims first made in The Mail on Sunday that historians have indeed got it wrong.

A new battle: In late 2013, experts claimed that King Harold died with an arrow in his eye not at the site of Battle Abbey (which has a dedicated vistor's centre - but on a spot that is now a roundabout on the A2100

Their research suggests King Harold probably died not at the site of Battle Abbey, where English  Heritage has built a £500,000 centre, but on a spot that is now a round-about on the A2100.

The evidence will feature on Channel 4’s Time Team following excavations of both the grounds around Battle Abbey, where English Heritage believes the fighting to have taken place, and another nearby site proposed by historian John Grehan.

Despite expert analysis, Time Team found no archaeological evidence that either was where the army of William the Conqueror  triumphed over the forces of Harold, the English King.

Harold himself was reputedly killed when an arrow struck him in the eye.

Using aerial laser imaging, Time Team then mapped the terrain - on the basis of which a group of experts agreed that the most likely location for the battle was a roundabout joining Upper and Lower Lake in the town of Battle.

Time Team said the mapping had ‘proved’ that the traditional battlefield - on the land directly below the Abbey - would have been too boggy for William’s cavalry.

‘Military analysts studied the data to see where Harold, a skilled commander, would most probably have mounted his defence,’ explained a Channel 4 spokesman.

‘They identified the only ideal battlefield. It seems Harold’s fearsome Saxon shield wall straddled a narrow strategic pass that is on today’s A2100.’

Mr Grehan, who proposed that the battle was fought at Caldbec Hill, about a mile north of the abbey, said last night: ‘The one thing that is absolutely certain is that the existing site can’t be the right one. According to Time Team the abbey site is facing in the wrong direction.’

Nick Austin, author of Secrets Of The Norman Invasion - whose own favoured site is Crowhurst, two miles south of the Abbey - asserted in The Mail on Sunday in 2011 that the traditional site was incorrect.

He said: ‘The claim that the Normans fought the battle at Battle Abbey is not based on any physical evidence, either in archaeological finds or ancient manuscript.’

English Heritage disputes the Time Team claims. Roy Porter, a Battle Abbey curator, said: ‘Within living memory of the battle, the abbey was described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as being founded by William “on the very spot where God granted him the conquest of England”.’
