Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, the law enforcement officer in command of the police presence on the ground in race riot-torn Ferguson, has been falsely accused of being a gang member after several photos surfaced on social media of him making hand signs.

Rather than showing an affiliation with the Bloods, Crips or any other gang, the photos show Captain Johnson simply showing his fraternity sign, known is a Kappa greeting.

Capt. Johnson is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi, a black fraternity that was formed in 1911 at Indiana University in Bloomington.

The false accusation that Johnson was somehow gang affiliated originated in a post on CNN’s iReport site which has since been removed, it was then circulated on Twitter by user @DixielandDiva, an account that no longer exists, reports The Washington Post.  

Capt. Johnson met briefly on Wednesday with U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder who was visiting the St. Louis suburb that has endured more than a week of unrest fueled by the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white officer. 

The Obama administration intended the trip to underscore its commitment to civil rights in general and the Ferguson case in particular. 

Asked whether he had confidence in the local investigation of the police officer, Johnson said Holder's presence 'is a guarantee on that.'

In the wake of Brown’s death on August 9, a photo of him flashing the peace sign was also misinterpreted as a gang sign.

African Americans across the country then started posting contrasting images of themselves to Twitter along with the hashtag #iftheygunnedmedown, in protest at the way the media portrays black people.

The Kappas are part of the Divine Nine or the National Pan-Hellenic Council, the nine historically black fraternities and sororities that include Delta Sigma Theta, Alpha Kappa Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha, Omega Psi Phi, Phi Beta Sigma, Zeta Phi Beta, Sigma Gamma Rho and Iota Phi Theta, none of which are gangs.
