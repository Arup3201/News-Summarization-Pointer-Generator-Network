Former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini looked rejuvenated as he began his second stint in charge of Inter Milan.

Mancini left Galatasaray by mutual consent in June, and has been out of work since. Inter are struggling in ninth position in Serie A after a summer of heavy spending, and they sacked Walter Mazzarri on Friday.

Mancini was presented to the media during a press conference on Saturday, and spoke about the challenges ahead.

The 49-year-old was very successful in his last spell at Inter, leading them to three successive league titles

'I never thought I would return... but I think it can be another nice story,' Mancini said. 'I believe in this project.

'It's up to us to find that spark again, bring the fans back to the stadium and return to winning ways. I'm really happy to be here. If I've come back it must mean that I've done something right elsewhere, that's all that matters.' 

Conversation moved to his previous experience in the Nerazzurri dugout, and Mancini admitted that it is nice to be back.

'It's hard to make comparisons. It's nice to be welcomed back in an atmosphere like this though, because that's fundamental in this job.  

'They laid out all their plans and I think we can write another success story. I believe in this club's plans. We have to knuckle down because if we work hard we can achieve great things.' 

Before the press conference Mancini held up an Inter shirt with his name on and the number 226 - the number of matches he was in charge of between 2004-2008.

Mancini led Inter to three successive league titles during his four-year reign between 2004 and 2008.

He was replaced by Jose Mourinho, and went on to manage City, where he won another league title in 2012.

The topic of his overseas experience was brought up during his unveiling.

'Working abroad enriches you so much. You get to measure up to different ways of playing the game. The last six years have been magnificent, in the Premier League and in Turkey. 

'Both were fantastic experiences. Now I'm back in Italy, back at Inter, and I'm glad to be here. I'm very happy to be working in Italy again. I'd like to thank president Thohir.'

Speaking about his new manager, Inter President Erick Thohir said: 'His track record both at Inter and elsewhere speaks for itself.

'His international experience and hunger for success will I know drive the team to the next level.'
