President Barack Obama's 'Yes We Can' slogan has become one of the most famous in political history, but it seems he was not always sold on the expression.

David Axelrod, Obama's media consultant at the time, has claimed that the then-presidential hopeful thought it was 'too corny.'

Until his wife Michelle managed to change his mind.

'Michelle just happened to come by for the first ad shoot,' said Obama's former media consultant Axelrod in a recent interview, where she told her husband it was 'not corny'

'Michelle just happened to come by for the first ad shoot, and that was the ad that closed with the line “Yes we can.” He read through the script once, and after the first take he said, “Gee, is that too corny?”,' said Axelrod in an interview with the New York Times. 

'I explained why I thought it was a great tagline, and he turned to Michelle and said, “What do you think?” She just slowly shook her head from side to side and said, “Not corny.” Thank God she was there that day.'

Axelrod previously made waves with his revelation that despite his public stance in 2008, President Obama had always been in favor of same-sex marriage.

The President however claimed that his views had evolved when he finally voices his support for the issue in May 2012.

President Obama responded to that claim earlier this week saying that Axelrod 'is mixing up my personal feelings with my position on the issue.' 

Axelrod also came under fire earlier this week when he claimed that during a post-election concession phone call in 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney hinted to Obama that he won primarily on the strength of black voter turnout in inner cities.

'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee,' Romney told the president, according to Axelrod's version of events.

But Romney's personal aide Garrett Jackson said he was in the room, listening to Romney's end of the conversation, and nothing like that conversation ever occurred.
