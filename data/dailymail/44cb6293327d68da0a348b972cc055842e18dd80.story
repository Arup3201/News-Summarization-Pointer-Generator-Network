A bulldog and its bruiser owner, a socialite with her chihuahua... there are times when the characteristics shared by people and their pets are plain to see.

But occasionally, the personality traits are more subtle - such as the unspoken bond between a lady and her turtle, or a man and his cockatoo.

Hamburg-based photographer Tobias Lang (aka Mats Pitka) has been studying people and their pets for some time.

As part of his ongoing project Your Pet 
And You, he snapped these delightful side-by-side portraits that reveal 
the subtleties of likeness in their relationships - whether it be in a 
smile, posture, or even a hairstyle.

All gloved up: As part of his ongoing project Your Pet And You, Lang snapped these delightful side-by-side portraits that reveal the subtleties of likeness in their relationships - whether it be in a smile, posture, or even a hairstyle

Lang hopes to create at least 200 portraits. Above, a solemn-looking pet owner with his snake

And while the owner is always seen standing, the pet is positioned on a wooden block.

The idea came to Lang while he was at home with his roommate's cat, which was drawn to a wooden block in the living room.

Lang took a picture of his friend and his furry companion, and soon other people wanted their portraits taken in a similar style.

The project snowballed and Lang began tweaking the image splits of owner and pet, playing with the perspective.

Although a number of more unusual animals are on display, such as owls and snakes, he wants to branch out to even more exotic pets.

So if you own a meerkat, snail or fancy reptile, he'd love to hear from you.
