Fifteen British soldiers were buried in northern France today - close to the spot where they were cut down by German machine gun fire exactly 100 years ago.

Proud descendants of the First World War Tommies attended a hugely moving ceremony in the village of Bois-Grenier, near Armentieres, on the Belgium border.

All the men served with the York and Lancaster regiment, and were killed in an October 1914 offensive during the so-called 'Race to the Sea'.

Their remains were finally found five years ago during building work between the nearby villages of Beaucamps Ligny and Radinghem, and 11 were identified through DNA.

Those who have been positively identified and whose surviving family members have been traced are: Private Herbert Ernest Allcock, Private John Brameld, Private William Butterworth, Corporal Francis Carr Dyson, Private Walter Ellis, Private John Willie Jarvis, Private Leonard Arthur Morley, Private Ernest Oxer, Private John Richmond, Private William Alfred Singyard and Lance Corporal William Henry Warr.  

On a bright, clear morning today, a bugle played the Last Post, as all were buried with full military honours.

Referring to Private John Richmond, one of those buried, his great nephew, Barrie Richmond, said: 'I got this letter saying they matched the DNA, and Great Uncle John was one of the 58 in this trench in France.'

Mr Richmond, from Ravenshead, Nottinghamshire, added: 'It was mind blowing and humbling.'

Sue Raftree, of the Commemorations Team which finds descendants, said: 'DNA has made it much easier. We are rewarded by being able to identify more of our soldiers and to trace their families and give final closure.'

The inscription on Pte Richmond's headstone reads: 'He fell and was lost but now he is found. Rest in peace at last. His life given so that we might be free.'

Also buried was Pte William Butterworth, aged 36 when he died on 18 October 1914. He was one of four brothers killed in the war.

His great-grandson Ian Birnie, who travelled to France for the ceremony, said: 'When he were told that it was William, it was almost as if we'd lost someone only yesterday.

'It seems ridiculous as this happened 100 years ago, but to me, and to our family, this is a loss.

'I get upset about it because there wasn't just one brother, but the funeral will give us some closure for the four brothers.'

The Race to the Sea took place between September and October 1914, as the British and French tried to surround their enemy, using the sea to trap them.

It soon turned into the kind of relentless trench warfare which was to characterise the entire war, which was to claim around 16 million lives, including some 1 million among British Empire troops.

Those who have been positively identified and whose surviving family members have been traced are: Private Herbert Ernest Allcock, Private John Brameld, Private William Butterworth, Corporal Francis Carr Dyson, Private Walter Ellis, Private John Willie Jarvis, Private Leonard Arthur Morley, Private Ernest Oxer, Private John Richmond, Private William A
