Lionel Messi warmed up for Wednesday's clash against Croatia in a training ground game against West Ham's Under 21 side.

But the elements battered the Barcelona superstar as a strong Argentina side were put through their paces at the Hammers' wet and windy Rush Green Academy base in Essex on Tuesday evening.

A large gathering of local schoolchildren waited for an hour outside the club's gates to catch a glimpse of their hero. They screamed hysterically when the team bus eventually arrived as Messi fever gripped the East End.

Even the Hammers youth team were in disbelief as they got to share the same pitch with some of their idols. Young starlet Sam Westley tweeted: ‘Unreal experience playing a practice match against Argentina first team tonight. Playing against Messi was one of my best experiences ever.’

And Westley’s team-mate Matthias Fanimo added: ‘Easily without doubt the best day of my life.. What an experience! Don't think anythings [sic] topping that’ 

Carlos Tevez, a cult hero in these parts following his season-long spell at West Ham in 2006-07, was also in tow and played in the behind-closed doors clash alongside Messi, Sergio Aguero, Javier Mascherano and Angel di Maria.

Writing on his Facebook page, Messi told his legion of followers how happy he was to be in England.

He said: ‘Finished training in London. Really happy to be here with my Argentina team-mates. Looking forward to our next two matches!’

Croatia are without a host of their big-name players with captain Darijo Srna, Liverpool's Dejan Lovren, Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric, Barcelona's Ivan Rakitic and Atletico Madrid forntman Mario Mandzukic all set to miss out. But Argentina boss Gerardo Martino has vowed to play all of his stars in the glamour game at Upton Park on Wednesday night.

Around 17,000 supporters are expected to walk through the Boleyn Ground turnstiles and, speaking at a press conference in Essex, Martino said: 'We have so many possibilities up front. Kun Aguero is one of the top scorers in England, Tevez is doing well in Italy and, of course. [Lionel] Messi.

'It's going to be hard to see them all in the starting line-up at the same time all the time. It would be unfair on the other players who are not No 9s and who we want to see.

'We have decided that Messi will play on the right because if he played like he does for his club, we would have a fourth No 9.

'Obviously I have a system and like to stick to it. But this is a good opportunity to try as many of these top players up front as possible.'

Barcelona superstar Messi has been tipped to be a massive success if he ever decided to ply his trade in the Premier League

Former Manchester United and Man City striker Tevez will end his three-year international exile when he takes to his old east London stomping ground.

Tevez has been in prolific form so far this season with Juventus, scoring 10 goals in 14 games - including a solo stunner against Serie A rivals Parma last Sunday.

And Martino said: ‘He has probably been one of the three best players in the past two Italian league seasons, so he deserves a place in the squad.’

Argentina are without injured Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo but former Barcelona boss Martino is happy with the world class squad at his disposal.

He'll be looking to keep Messi fresh for next Tuesday, when the South American side face Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal at Old Trafford.

Martino declared the 27-year-old would be a massive success if he ever decided to stay permanently in England and play in the Barclays Premier League.

However, the 51-year-old boss added that he seriously doubts that the four-time world player of the year would ever contemplate leaving the Nou Camp.

'The Premier League is huge and Leo has all the qualities required to play in such a great competition,’ said Martino.

'But it's difficult because you won't find a player who is closer to Barcelona than Messi. At the end of the day, it would be up to Leo to one day make that decision.'

Tickets to see Messi at Upton Park will be sold on the night with adults costing £25 and kids at £15.
