A 13-year-old Washington School boy became suicidal according to his parents after his teacher allegedly bullied him and wrestled him to the floor.

The unnamed teen told his parents 'I want to die. I want to kill myself.' following the incident involving John Rosi the school wrestling coach at Gig Harbor's Kopachuk Middle School.

Caught on film by fellow students the alleged bullying by Rosi directly followed a 15-minute period where the boys fellow eighth-graders swung him from his arms and legs, wrote on his feet, stuck a traffic cone on his head, gagged him with his own sock and taunted him.

The teenagers parents became aware of the incident which occurred in February after their son refused to go to school and became withdrawn.

They complained and asked Kopachuk to make students hand over relevant video footage from their cell-phones when requested.

'I was shocked. My wife broke down crying. It was tough to see,' said Randall Kinney, the boy's father to KING5.com

The incident happened at around 9 a.m. in the morning during a class and Rosi is seen to join in with the swinging of the boy by poking him and pretending to sit on him, saying, 'I'm feeling kind of gassy.'

The class that is supposed to be in session is a half hour reading and math preparation lesson conducted by Rosi.

In one of the videos, a dozen students drag the teenager around the room, swing him like a hammock, rip off his socks, write on his feet, shove a sock down his mouth, hold a pillow over his face and then cover him with chairs.

This continues for 15 minutes until Rosi joins in and smiles and at one point, he smiles for the cameras.

Following viewings of the video, Rosi, a 14-year-veteran of the school was suspended for 10 days without pay, given training and then eventually moved to another school.

According to the Tacoma News Tribune his base salary as of 2010 was $64,174, with approximately $10,000 more for coaching duties.

'Rosi is completely ignorant of the fact that he’s got a whole classroom hazing one kid,' said the boy’s father, interviewed Monday by The News Tribune.

'They classified it as roughhousing. But it’s not 14 kids wrestling each other. It’s a dozen kids using my son to demonstrate their dominance over him.'

'I was horrified by what I saw,' said acting Peninsula School District Superintendent Chuck Cuzzetto to KSDK.Com

Cuzetto said the teacher displayed 'inappropriate classroom management,' but the district decided against firing the teacher because of his 'body of work' over an 18-year teaching career in the district.

'It's an isolated situation in an 18-year career. That's horrific, and it deserves some pretty significant action fast. And that's what we did,' said Cuzzetto.

However, after watching their child being man-handled by Rosi, the Kinney's are calling for police intervention and his firing from the school district.

'I don't think he realizes what he has done,' said Karla Kinney, the boy's mother.

Pierce County sheriff’s detectives are investigating the complaint and seeking records of the school district’s investigation, said detective Lynelle Anderson, spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Office.

The teen who is now 14, is attending a private school having left Kopachuk Middle school.

Back in February when the incident was investigated, Rosi apologised but said that he did not 'view the incident as anything more than harmless childhood horse play and a chance for the kids to take a break from the daily grind.'

His written statement to the school said that he understood that the classroom was not appropriate for horseplay and that he will view the incident as a 'learning experience.'
