David Moyes has appeared to question whether Manchester United's best is still good enough as the club bid to avoid a fourth successive defeat for the first time in 53 years.

Also: Everyone has a story about Emmanuel Adebayor. They are not uniformly positive.

So here comes one of the most beguiling and entirely unpredictable stories of a Premier League season which is not exactly short of them. We are about to discover whether Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the epitome of equanimity and an uncombative nature, can form a successful partnership with Vincent Tan, the serial interferer from Malaysia who regularly telephoned the new Cardiff City manager's predecessor with requests that his players score more goals from distance and make better use of throw-ins.

Also: Sam Allardyce believes Andy Carroll need only take a seat on the bench to provide his West Ham United team-mates and the club's supporters with a significant and timely fillip as they end a tumultuous week by resuming their struggle to stay in the Premier League with a key fixture at Cardiff City.

David Moyes has said he will not alter his course at Manchester United by defiantly vowing to keep faith with the methods that have left the club facing four consecutive defeats for the first time in more than 50 years.

Also: Sam Allardyce insists he was right to blow his West Ham budget on Andy Carroll and would sign the striker with an injury again.

David Moyes' traumatic week continued when the Manchester United manager was charged by the Football Association for misconduct yesterday, having been forced to deny his new-look coaching staff are the prime reason for the champions' dismal run of form.

Also: Jose Mourinho says he has helped Eden Hazard improve so much it is now inconceivable that Chelsea could sell the Belgian - even for 'crazy' money.

David Moyes fears that his players may not be good enough to halt Manchester United's slide.

Also: Manuel Pellegrini took a thinly disguised dig at Roberto Mancini by claiming he has liberated Manchester City's stars.

Peter Schmeichel has accused Manchester United players of ducking their responsibilities.

Also: Sam Allardyce has waited all season for bearded saviour Andy Carroll to resurrect West Ham's season.

Andy Carroll will be catapulted back into West Ham's squad today.

Also: Manchester United hope there is a Pharoah chance a trip to Egypt will solve Wayne Rooney's injury woe.

Wayne Rooney has been sent on a sunshine break to boost his fitness in the hope he can save Manchester United's season.

Also: FA chairman Greg Dyke has revealed just the final details are being discussed before it is officially announced the 2022 World Cup will not take place in the summer.
