Miriam Clegg today revealed the secret to being a politician's wife is a thick skin, plenty of coffee and not getting cross when the media attacks her husband Nick.

In a new Lib Dem attempt to woo daytime TV viewers, the Cleggs appeared on ITV's Lorraine, chatting on the sofa and cooking jacket potatoes with ragu.

Mrs Clegg admitted her husband is not a great cook, but she would like George Clooney to play him in a film of his life.

With the Lib Dems struggling on just 7 per cent in the polls, Mr Clegg took time out from being Deputy Prime Minister to show off his culinary skills to Lorraine Kelly and chef James Tanner.

In the past Mrs Clegg has sought to focus on her career as an international lawyer, refusing to become involved in the day-to-day machinations of Westminster life.

As the couple chatted in the show's kitchen, Kelly remarked that she did not seem like a 'typical' politician's wife.

Mrs Clegg replied: 'I don't know what is a typical politician's wife really. I try to help as much as I can but I try not to change completely my life and certainly not our children's lives for it and you have to do whatever you feel comfortable with.

'For me, the limit, the red line is a political role. I feel very strongly that politics or partly politics at least is for those who are elected.

'I am not elected so that is the red line but everything else that I can do, it's a privilege obviously to be in that position and if you can use it for something positive then that is great.'

The decision to appear with Lorraine Kelly on daytime TV will be seen as a sign that Mrs Clegg could broaden the appeal of the Lib Dems

After making her appearance on the show, Mrs Clegg was later seen leaving the ITV Studios on London's South Bank

However her decision to appear with her husband on daytime TV will be seen as a sign that she could broaden the appeal of the party.

Surprisingly she appeared unaffected by media attacks on her husband. 'I have been through this now for a while, I know how not to take things personally and I know why there is a certain sector that do that for other reasons.

'I don't get cross when he is criticised and I don't get cross when I am criticised. There is a sector of the media that like criticism.'

However, she was careful not to totally rule out going into politics herself one day: 'I think that you need to have a lot of emotional strength now to be in politics and I don't know whether I have it.'

In an apparent attempt to connect with mothers watching at home, Mrs Clegg revealed how she juggles work and family life.

'There are lots of mums who don't work outside the home and they work very hard,' she said

'I do it with help at home and also help from my family, my mother, Nick's mum.

'I have help at work, I have a fantastic team… really, really supportive there and then with lots of coffee. If coffee is bad for health, I'm done.'

Despite the support from family, Mr Clegg's own efforts in the kitchen got mixed reviews.

'Out of all of his strengths, I wouldn't put cooking at the top,' she said.

But asked who would play her husband in a film, she set her sights high: 'Is George Clooney on offer?'

She later added she would like 'a handsome one' to play the Deputy Prime Minister.
