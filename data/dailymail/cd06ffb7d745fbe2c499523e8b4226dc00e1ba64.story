Of all the unlikely success stories at this World Cup, it would be hard to top that of emerging US star Graham Zusi.

Five years ago, he was living with the parents of team-mate Matt Besler to save money as he tried to get MLS club Sporting Kansas City to turn a six-month contract into something more permanent.

Not only is he still with Kansas in 2014 and their star player, Zusi has also gone on to become Jurgen Klinsmann's secret weapon at this World Cup.

All American hero: Graham Zusi has emerged as one of the stars of the USA team

Having started the tournament on the bench, he's set up the two goals that have got the US into the knockout stages and created unprecedented soccer-fever back  home. Naturally, Klinsmann is delighted with midfielder, recognisable for flowing dark locks and the God-like nickname “Zeus”:

'He's in the inner circle now,' said the German manager. 'He has stepped  it up, gained confidence and that's great to see.'

West Ham may also wonder why he didn't stand out when he trained with them in January 2013, returning to America without a contract offer at Upton Park.

If we didn't know too much about him before the World Cup, you can be sure Belgium manager Marc Wilmots has done his research on 26-year-old Zusi, and particularly his delivery at set-pieces, before Tuesday night's round of 16 tie in Salvador.

Zusi's story is typical of the new generation of American players taking the game to a new audience.

No soccer player Stateside is born with a silver spoon. Starting salaries even at MLS level can be as low as $34,000-a-year (£20,000) and you have to show hunger and desire to make it.

Zusi was only ranked 23rd in the draft system used by American sport when he was signed by Kansas in 2009. He couldn't afford his own apartment in the city so slept on an airbed in someone else's, and then moved in with Besler and his family. In a nice twist, Besler is also in Klinsmann's  World Cup squad in Brazil.

In MLS,  Zusi proved to be a slow burner. 2012 was his breakthrough year, top of the assist charts with 15, and a 45-yard free-kick proving a Youtube sensation, that includes the amusing commentary: “Pizza Hut Park has become the field of dreams for Graham Zusi”.

When a move to England didn't work out early in 2013, Zusi returned home and got a new four-year contract with Kansas.

Klinsmann took note. Zusi became an important player in qualification and his goal against Panama also helped Mexico qualify for the finals, making him a hero there too.

In Brazil, the Zusi success story has really taken off. A late substitute in the first US game against Ghana,  it was his brilliant outswinging corner that set up John Brooks to head the winner, leaving the scorer in disbelief.

Zusi was put in the starting line-up with Jozy Altidore injured, and he set up Clint Dempsey's goal against Portugal with another important cross. It proved the goal that ultimately took the US into the knockout stages.

Despite Belgium's galaxy of stars, there is a growing sense of belief in the US team that they can reach the quarter-finals for only the second time. Zusi and his colleagues are threatening to become as popular as NBA or NFL stars.

Having his old buddy Besler beside him has made it all the more special for the 26-year-old, who has scored and made goals consistently for the past two seasons.

'After all we've been through together,' he said. 'I can't imagine sharing this experience with anyone else.'
