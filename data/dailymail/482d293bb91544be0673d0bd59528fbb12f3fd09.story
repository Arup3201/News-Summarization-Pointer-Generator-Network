A Chicago father-of-two, who recently came out as homosexual, is accused of murdering his wife in an elaborate fake hijacking in order to get an insurance payout.

Darron Brewer, 26, allegedly convinced his younger brother, Dujuan Powe, to hijack his family's car and force 22-year-old Kenyatae Collier-Brewer into the trunk where she was shot dead as the couple's children were in the back seat.

The brothers, who are now on trial, then planned to collect on a spousal life insurance policy provided through Brewer's employer, the U.S. National Guard, that would no longer be valid if the gay man ended his marriage, prosecutors said.

Those benefits 'were about to end because their marriage was going to end,' Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Jeff Allen told jurors in opening statements on Monday. 'Greed is the only word to describe why Kenyatae had to die.'

He added that Brewer's boyfriend will testify during the trial.

According to DNAInfo, police found Collier-Brewer's dead body in the trunk of the car after the October 25, 2009 slaying.

Brewer called 911 to report the hijacking and gave the location of the vehicle. The gun used to take her life was found hidden under a pile of mattresses at Powe's girlfriend's home, implicating the brothers, who each claim their innocence and blame the other.

The pair had in fact planned to kill the young mother earlier in October, according to Allen, but failed.

Allen said Powe, who goes by the name 'Scooter,' was supposed to surprise Collier-Brewer in her home and 'choke her to death.'

'He saw her coming out of the bathroom, he couldn't do it,' Allen said, adding that instead of killing her at that time, he had consensual sex with her.

The alleged murder plot finally played out a couple of weeks later, when Collier-Brewer finished work and collected Brewer and their two children on the South Side of the city to take them home.

Her husband took the wheel while she 
dozed in the front seat on their way to their West Side home but he took
a detour, going more than a mile out of his way to get gas at a 
station.

That's where, Powe ambushed the family, wearing a mask from the movie 'Scream,' and, wielding a gun, forced Collier-Brewer to crawl into the trunk.

Allen told the jury the entire fake carjacking was caught by a surveillance camera, footage from which is likely to be shown in court as the trial continues.

'You'll see (Brewer) rearrange items in the trunk that will become her coffin,' Allen said. 'You'll see the fake carjacking go down.'

The woman's body was discovered in the trunk about 24 hours later after her husband reported her missing.

'(Brewer) planned it, and then did it,' Allen said, asking jurors to find both men guilty of Collier-Brewer's murder.

But attorneys for both Brewer and Powe blame the other in the slaying.

'Scooter had his own plan. Scooter comes up with a mask and and gun ... and he pulls a carjacking,' defense attorney Rebecca Washtenaw said, according to DNAInfo. 'Darron puts his head in the sand.'

Powe's public defender Brian Walsh told jurors that the younger brother 'was not in on the plan, did not take part in the plan.'

Powe's brother 'wanted out of his relationship so bad he wanted to kill her,' Walsh told jurors.
