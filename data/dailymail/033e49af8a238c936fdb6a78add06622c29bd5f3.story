Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea is destined to emulate Peter Schmeichel's success at Old Trafford, according to Reds legend Paddy Crerand. 

Despite United's problems in defence this season, the 24-year-old has been in inspired form making several match saving contributions - prompting Crerand to claim he can become as important to the club as Schmeichel, who won 15 major trophies between 1991 and 1999.

Speaking to MUTV, the 75-year-old said: 'I remember when Schmeichel first came here, he struggled a little bit with crossed balls, but he got better as he got older and was an absolutely fantastic keeper for Manchester United. This kid [De Gea] could get there no problem.'

De Gea no longer struggles with high balls into the box, claims United legend Paddy Crerand

De Gea drew criticism after struggling to adapt to the physical nature of the Premier League during his early United career, but Crerand insists those days are behind him.

'He's getting better and better. I remember when he first arrived - if you watch Spanish football, you never see balls being thrown into the box - so when he came here at first teams tried to make it as difficult as possible for him,' he said.

'He must have found it strange but he's improved out of all recognition - he doesn't have any problems with that type of ball into the box any more'.

At only 24, De Gea has plenty of time to establish himself as an Old Trafford legend

Crerand also believes that the 24-year-old has time on his side to become one of the club's all-time greats.

The 1968 European Cup winner said: 'David has been terrific for the last couple of seasons and is getting better and better. He is only 24 – that is so young for a keeper. You expect them to be at their best when they're 34, so what's he going to be like in the next five or six years? 

'When do we ever have a goalkeeper as man of the match at Old Trafford? Never. It just shows you how well he's done, he's been fantastic,' he added.
