By the time the most calamitous, catastrophic and cursed Ryder Cup debut ever to feature in Stephen Gallacher’s worst nightmares had come to a shuddering anti-climax, victorious American rookies Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed were six under par.

That’s not a bad better-ball score for 14 holes. Certainly far too good for a European pairing who played just about well enough to be six under fives for their truncated round.

Give Gallacher another hundred burls around Gleneagles and he’ll probably never turn in such a tight and tension-ridden show of unimpressive scoring. Give him a partner like Ian Poulter – the Ian Poulter of yesterday, not Ryder Cups past – and even his best performance might not be enough.

Stephen Gallacher made a shocking Ryder Cup debut on Friday as he froze under the pressure of the occasion

Partner Ian Poulter was unable to salvage anything for Europe on Friday morning, and performed poorly

Against a couple of US first-timers who should have been standing on that first tee with everything from toenails to split ends clenched under the strain of the situation, the local hero and *the* hero of so many European triumphs were found more than wanting.

Their round started with Gallacher finding the bunker, the hazard and then the run-off area behind the green before picking up – and ended with the unforgivable sight, very nearly an unpardonable sin, of Poulter leaving short a birdie putt that would have at least extended the match to the 15th tee.

Beaten? Gallacher and Poulter were pulverised by the accuracy of Spieth and the clutch putting of Reed, the self-styled world top five player who backed up his big mouth with some really impressive play in a 5&4 away win.

And yet, on a day that had begun in an atmosphere described by Gallacher as ‘euphoric’, the Americans didn’t need to play like the next Phil Mickelson-Keegan Bradley partnership in order to get the points. They were never under pressure.

Poulter could offer only consolation and hope to his crestfallen partner afterwards, reminding him that his own unhappy debut – a 4&3 fourballs beating, in the company of Darren Clarke, by Tiger Woods and Chris Riley – didn’t do him any long-term harm.

‘I said to Stevie walking off the golf course today that, when I played with Darren Clarke in 2004, we had our butts kicked the first time I ever played - and obviously we’ve had that today,’ said the Englishman, who suffered only his fourth loss in 16 Ryder Cup matches.

‘But you know what, things can change very quickly and we have to keep our heads up right now. It didn’t quite work for us on the golf course but we have to look forward to the matches we’re going to play ahead.

‘This is a tricky golf course and tricky conditions. I don’t think the scores are as low as what some people are expecting out there. So we have to stay focused, be strong as a team and go out there and deliver.’

Both men will need to improve drastically if they’re to contribute. From the off, with Gallacher looking even more pale than usual, they simply struggled to get to grips with their games, their opponents and the occasion.

From the moment Poulter lipped out a short putt on the first, they were in trouble. Gallacher birdied the par-five second, enough for a half, but he didn’t contribute again until they were three down – and his missed birdie chance on the eighth, following his first really excellent iron shot of the day, felt like a turning point.

Watched by his mum, dad and son Jack, Gallacher was really struggling. He got little help from Poulter, who followed a perfect drive on the par-five ninth by clunking his approach shot into the middle of the water; it wasn’t even close. With both Spieth and Reed having looks at birdie, it was no surprise when the Yanks went four up.

They were five ahead after 10, Spieth draining one from 12 feet, and six clear when Reed made birdie on the 11th. At least Gallacher pulled a hole back on 12, a par enough to win the hole, but he missed a good chance to eat further into the deficit on the next, sliding a 10-footer past.

The end came on the 14th green, watched by Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, who were hanging around after having their own pairing dismantled on that very green a little earlier in the day.

Both Team Europe players had putts to win the hole. Both missed. Not quite the full story of the day. But not far off.

Gallacher, who had looked horribly tense for much of the day, admitted: ‘I think there are nerves any time you play. It’s just you learn to channel it and that’s why you’ve got pre-shot routines and things like that.

‘Maybe a wee bit to start with. I didn’t feel under any pressure at all, really. I was really looking forward to it, and it just didn’t really pan out. That was all. Didn’t quite play that well. And then when I did start to play well, I never capitalised on it by holing the putts.

‘I think your first Ryder Cup, obviously there’s a bit of excitement and a bit of sort of, you don’t really know what to expect. It took me maybe five or six holes to get into it. I was a bit out of rhythm but I would rather have the fans on you and cheering for you than not, if that’s what you mean.

‘It was a special reception on the first tee, something that I definitely will remember for the rest of my life. It was just euphoric, really. It was what I expected, basically, and a bit more.’

Poulter added: ‘To walk to the first tee with Stevie, at home for him, that was a special moment. He’s going to remember that for a long time and I’ll remember it, as well. It was an amazing atmosphere. But obviously we couldn’t do our bit to get them really loud.’

The star of the Miracle at Medinah also talked about the Americans having ‘ham and egged’ well, a reference to their ability to dovetail. Well, they certainly made mincemeat of our boys.
