A tweet from Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry's verified account on Sunday night included a disparaging image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power. The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account that disavowed the post.

The earlier tweet posted an unflattering mock image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013. Perry vetoed funds to her office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury in Austin this month indicting Perry — who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate.

The caption on the tweet reads: 'I don't always drive drunk at 3x the legal blood alcohol limit ...'

The Associated Press reported that the bottom of the caption of the tweet read 'but when I do, I indict Gov. Perry for calling me out about it. I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas.'

Lehmberg's office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry. It was handled by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio-based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge.

Tweet: This image appeared on the verified Twitter account for Gov. Rick Perry 

'Unauthorized':The post was removed and Perry claimed it was 'unauthorized'

Charged: Gov. Rick Perry, seen in this file photo, has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy 

'A tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized. I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down,' the later post said.

Perry aides did not immediately return messages seeking comment from the Associated Press. Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed. 

Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy. His high-powered legal team has asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague.

Conflict: Perry vetoed funds to Lehmberg's office when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury in Austin this month indicting Perry — who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate

Meme: The image posted to Perry's Twitter account seemed to use Lehmberg's April 2013 booking photo for drunk driving 

Second message: Rick Perry's authorized Twitter account posted this message after the mock image of Rosemary Lehmberg appeared

Perry cut off $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit — which is based in Travis County and prosecutes public corruption in Texas — when Lehmberg refused to resign. That veto drew a formal complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group.

Perry's verified account is updated frequently — and sometimes famously. After finishing in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry addressed speculation that he might call it quits with a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, and the words, 'Here we come South Carolina!'
