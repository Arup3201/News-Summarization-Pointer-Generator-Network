'Psycho': Kiaran Stapleton, 21, was convicted of the murder of Indian student Anuj Bidve, 23, and last week tried to take his prison chaplain hostage

A self-proclaimed 'psycho' killer who laughed as he shot a stranger in the head has tried to take his prison chaplain hostage after his appeal against a life sentence failed.

Kiaran Stapleton, who bragged 'I can do 30 years standing on my head', wanted to seek revenge in an attack at Full Sutton prison near York.

In October Stapleton pleaded to have his jail term reduced, despite saying he whiles away his days in 'the best cell on the wing'
waiting for his favourite soaps to begin while stuffing himself with sweets.

In a letter dripping with misspellings he wrote: 'I sit in my cell waiting for Emmerdale and Coronation St and Eastenders eating pure chocolate and other s***.

'Have got the best cell on the wing and nare 30 isent (sic) that long I dont think enyway. I can do it standing on my head "ha"'.

Last week the 21-year-old lured in the chaplain by saying he wanted to speak privately to come to terms with his appeal being thrown out.

But once they were alone he pulled a homemade weapon on the vicar, who managed to bring in help by pressing his panic button.

A  team of guards then wrestled Stapleton to the ground and disarmed him, while the chaplain escaped unharmed in an attack about a week ago.

A Prison Service spokesperson told MailOnline: 'On 30 November, a Full Sutton prisoner attempted to assault a member of the chaplaincy during worship.  The police have been notified.'

Stapleton was found guilty of murder in July for killing Anuj Bidve, 23, in 'a piece of cold-blooded controlled aggression' that shocked Britain.

Police have never established a motive for the attack by Stapleton, then 19.

Attack: Stapleton pulled a homemade weapon on the innocent vicar just because his 30-year jail term was not reduced

Bidve had arrived in the UK to study micro-electronics at Lancaster University and was visiting Manchester with a group of friends last Christmas.

Tragic: Indian student Anuj Bidve 23-year-old was gunned down on Boxing Day as he walked with a group of friends in Salford

They left their hotel in Salford to queue early for the sales when their paths crossed with Stapleton’s.

He calmly walked across the road and repeatedly asked for the time.

When someone finally answered he pulled a handgun out of his pocket and fired one shot to Mr Bidve’s left temple.

Stapleton told one psychologist in prison that he picked out his victim because 'he had the biggest head', the jury heard.

The day after the murder he booked into a hotel which overlooked the crime scene in Ordsall Lane and then later went to a tattoo parlour and had a teardrop design placed below his right eye - a symbol used by some gangs to mark that the wearer has killed someone.

But after officers revealed CCTV footage of him close to the scene and trying to burn his clothes in his back garden, he tried to blame a friend, before eventually admitting the manslaughter of Mr Bidve on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

He claimed he had a personality disorder which affected his self-control.

Sentencing him in July, Mr Justice King told Stapleton: 'In my judgment, this was no impulsive act on your part. It was a piece of cold-blooded controlled aggression.'

He said he had showed a 'most callous disregard' in laughing and smirking after he gunned down Mr Bidve and also during the trial.
