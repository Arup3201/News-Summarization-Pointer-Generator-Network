Alison White of West Yorkshire has lipoedema

For nearly as long as she can remember, Alison White has had big legs in comparison with the rest of her body.

'I've always had a flat stomach and a small chest, and I'm slim enough that you can see my hip bones sticking out a bit,' says the 32-year-old director of a market research company, who lives in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.

'But even though my waist is no bigger than 30 in, each of my thighs is about the same, and my calves are 18 in.

'My legs are like tree trunks all the way down to my ankles, then I have a ring where it always looks as if I've been wearing tight socks.'

Alison had assumed she was 'just a fatty' and when she hit her teens, she started to pay more attention to what she ate.

'I got into the habit of not eating much at all - just an apple and a bit of cheese and bread now and then.

'I got down to a size ten on top, but had legs that looked as if they should belong to a much bigger person.'

To disguise this, she wore trousers rather than skirts and over the years continued to diet, trying everything from Atkins and Weight Watchers to meal replacement drinks, but nothing shifted the fat on her lower limbs.

'In 2010, I basically didn't eat for two months,' says Alison, who lives with her boyfriend James, who runs a business making corsets.

'I tracked my measurements at various points on my legs during the process, and though I dropped more than two stone overall - going from 13 st to 10 st 8lb and losing five inches from my waist - my legs stayed the same size.'

Finally, in April, she had a lightbulb moment when her boyfriend came across an internet article on a condition called lipoedema.

'James said: "I think this is you." I told him to stop being cheeky - my legs weren't nearly as big as those of the girl's in the picture.

'But when I read it, I realised he might be right. And I was relieved to discover I had an actual medical condition and that I wasn't the only one.'

Lipoedema is an abnormal distribution of fat that mainly causes the legs - and sometimes also the arms - to gradually become enlarged, says Dirk Pilat, a GP in Tower Hamlets, London, and medical consultant to the charity Lipoedema UK.

Both legs tend to be enlarged at the same time and to the same extent.

Those with the condition have an excess number of fat cells in affected areas, as well as a build-up of fluid in those cells.

The affected areas tend to feel softer and more doughy than normal fat, and may be tender to the touch, feel painful and bruise easily - as Alison can confirm.

'A wide variety of numbers are quoted as to how many people are affected - some studies say as many as 11 per cent of all women have it,' says Dr Pilat.

It is not clear what causes it, though it does run in families - 'though only on the female side,' he adds.

The condition which involves an abnormal build-up of fat cells in the thighs, buttocks and legs

Alison's mother's legs are slim, but she has female cousins with legs similar to hers, always referred to affectionately within her family by their cousins' surname as 'McKelvie legs'.

Dr Pilat says: 'It usually manifests itself after puberty or pregnancy, probably for hormonal reasons. Typically, a young girl will go to the gym or a PE class and notice her legs are bigger than those of her peers, especially if she is slim elsewhere.

'That may be what causes her to see her doctor.'

A survey of 250 sufferers by Lipoedema UK found that only 5 per cent had the condition diagnosed by their GP, and though most had experienced symptoms since their teens, the average age of diagnosis was 44.

Many patients claim they are simply told they are overweight - often prompting a cycle of weight loss that fails to budge the fat on their legs. This is because weight loss cannot reduce the number of fat cells. 

The condition is often confused with lymphoedema, a more widely recognised condition in which disruption to the lymphatic system - which drains excess fluid from the body - causes swelling in the arms and legs.

One key difference is that lipoedema patients typically have an 'ankle bracelet' effect, where excess fat stops just before the feet. Doctors are unsure why the fat is distributed in this way.

Constantinos Kyriakides, a consultant vascular surgeon at Barts Health NHS Trust, says: 'There are no definitive tests for lipoedema, so it's diagnosis by exclusion. 

'We would typically exclude lymphoedema by doing a clinical examination and a lymphoscintigram - a test that involves injecting a radioactive tracer into the lymphatic system to see how well it moves.'

The difficulty is that some lipoedema patients develop an element of lymphodema, too, known as lipo-lymphoedema.

'The pressure of the fat tissue can obstruct the lymphatics, so you end up with a combination of the two,' says Mr Kyriakides.

Both conditions are treated and managed in a similar way. Lymphatic drainage massage involves a physiotherapist manually squeezing fluid out of the fat cells and into the blood vessels.

It's not a cure, but something to be done at regular intervals.

Patients can also wear compression hosiery that helps to reduce the amount of fluid in fat cells.

Low-impact exercise, such as swimming, may help to stimulate the movement of fluid and doesn't put too much pressure on the joints. 

Patients claim they are told they are overweight

Lipoedema patients may experience joint pain, particularly in the knees, perhaps due to the extra leg weight they are carrying. Those affected may want a more permanent cure. However, Mr Kyriakides cautions against opting for surgical treatments such as liposuction.

'With standard liposuction you put big cannulas - tubes that allow fluid to be removed - into the deeper tissues and suck out a lot of fat. But this can damage lymphatic drainage from the leg, which can trigger lymphoedema.'

There is evidence that another type of liposuction - tumescent liposuction - can be effective and spare the lymphatic channels.

This involves pumping in a liquid solution that provides local anaesthetic and creates a 'buffer' separating the superficial layer of fat from the deeper tissues, where the lymphatic channels are, says Mr Kyriakides.

'You then suck out the fat cells with micro cannulas. It's easier to do on the upper leg, where there is more loose tissue.

'But while I can understand the principle of tumescent liposuction, those who get this treatment aren't necessarily made aware that they should continue to have lymphatic drainage massage or compression. All liposuction does is remove some fat cells - it doesn't stop the other fat cells in the area storing more fluid, so the problem may return.'

At one point, Alison, who is actively involved with Lipoedema UK, considered paying to have standard liposuction, until she learnt of the risks.

She is concerned that patients are not receiving the correct information about what does and doesn't work, and that effective surgical measures are not available on the NHS.

'Our charity knows of only one surgeon who does the right sort of liposuction - and he is based in Germany.'

Yet when it comes to lipoedema, British conservatism in treating it may be a good thing, says Pia Ostergaard, a lecturer in human genetics at St George's University, London, who is doing research into lymphoedema. 

'There may be places that are willing to offer treatments. But if you don't have the biological understanding to back it up, you might make it worse. As we don't yet know the underlying cause, it's difficult to progress to knowing how best to treat it.'

When Alison went to her GP, he had never heard of lipoedema.

'I asked to be referred to a lymphoedema centre six months ago, but have still heard nothing,' she says. 'I ended up going to New York last month to get an official diagnosis from a specialist, who finally confirmed that I have the condition.'

It means Alison, who also has an element of the condition in her upper arms, hasn't yet had any form of treatment.

Meanwhile, Lipoedema UK, with the Royal College of GPs, has launched an online course to raise awareness of the condition among family doctors.

'Some people don't realise they have it until their 70s - having spent their whole lives being fobbed off with being told they need to diet more and do more exercise,' says Alison. 'This needs to stop.'
