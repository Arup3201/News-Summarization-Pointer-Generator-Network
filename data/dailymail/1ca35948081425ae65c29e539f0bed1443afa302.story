Unions today demanded a Labour government seize control of Royal Mail and the railways.

In a further sign of the party lurching to the left, the Labour conference voted to demand the renationalisation of train firms and postal deliveries.

Ed Miliband moved quickly to try to reject the idea, claiming there was not the money available for a future government to buy back privatised services.

Labour members and unions demanded Labour promise to renationalise the Royal Mail and the railways

The Labour leader yesterday delivered what was widely seen as one of the most left-wing speeches by a party chief for decades.

He vowed to use state controls to block energy bill rises, seize land which developers refuse to build on and drive up wages in some sectors.

Today delegates backed motions calling for Labour to renationaliste the railways and reverse the coalition's plans to sell-off the Royal Mail.

Tosh McDonald, vice president of the train drivers' union Aslef, said it was ‘a nonsense’ that most of the railways remain in private ownership, claiming that higher fares should not subsidise investment in the network.

In a speech to the Labour Party conference in Brighton, Mr McDonald said East Coast Mainline, which is publicly owned, made £800 million for the Treasury, while only 1.3 per cent of its income came from the taxpayer.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has faced claims he wants to return Britain to 1970s-style state control

By comparison, he said, the Virgin-run West Coast Mainline took 13 per cent of its income from the Government.

In an emergency motion put to the conference, which was seconded by Aslef and tabled by railway workers' union the TSSA, delegates were asked to support the renationalising of the railways.

The motion stated: ‘Conference calls on a future Labour government to run our railways in the interest of passengers by retaining and extending this successful model of public ownership to each franchise as it expires and by integrating track and train operations.’

Mick Carney, president of the TSSA, said the model of privatisation had failed and urged Mr Miliband to be as tough with rail firms as he has promised to be with energy companies by ordering a two-year freeze in bills.

He said: ‘Privatisation has failed. It has failed with the energy companies, where year on year prices rocket, so it is no surprise to see them bleating on after Ed's announcement yesterday.

‘It has failed in the water industry, where before this year we had seven of the wettest summers on record and yet as soon as the sun comes out they are screaming for hosepipe bans because the huge profits they have made have lined the pockets of shareholders and not fixed pipes.

‘It has failed the NHS and, unless we fight, it will fail the Royal Mail. The list goes on and it has failed our railways.’

Meanwhile the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) led the calls to keep the Royal Mail in public hands.

Katy Clark, Labour MP for North Ayrshire and Arran, defied Mr Miliband to offer her support to the campaign after claiming it would be a ‘disaster’ for postal services should privatisation go-ahead.

But the Labour leadership moved to rebuff the calls. A senior party source said: ‘Renationalisation is not out policy. Conference is entitled to its view. We are going to do the right thing. We are not going to spend money we do not have.’
