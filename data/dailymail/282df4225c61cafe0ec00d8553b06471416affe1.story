Just two percent of counties across the country are responsible for more than half of all death row cases and executions, a death penalty research group has revealed.

The Death Penalty Information Center argues that the death penalty has never been a nationwide policy - nor even a statewide policy.

Instead, it's the province of a few counties, usually because of prosecutors there who aggressively pursue the death penalty.

The southern U.S. is responsible for an overwhelming portion of death penalty cases since 1976. Even in the South, most cases come from just a few counties

'The disparate and highly clustered use of the death penalty raises serious questions of unequal and arbitrary application of the law,' the group writes in its reports.

'It also forces the jurisdictions that have resisted the death penalty for decades to pay for a costly legal process that is often marred with injustice.'

The Death Penalty Information Center officially has no stance on the death penalty, though critics say the reports the group produces exclusively argue against death penalty laws.

Its study found that since the death penalty was re-instated in the U.S. in 1976, just 2percent of counties are responsible for 52 percent of execution and 56 percent of all inmates on death row.

Additionally, 85 percent of counties in the U.S. have not had an execution since 1976.

Harris County, Texas, - home of Houston - and Dallas County, Texas, - home of Dallas - are the leading two counties in the country for executions since 1976

The figures are skewed, however, because only 32 states currently have the death penalty.

In the last decade, six large states - including New York, Illinois and New Jersey - abolished the death penalty.

The report singles out Maricopa County, Arizona - home to Phoenix and Sheriff Joe Arpaio, 'America's toughest sheriff.'

Maricopa, which has 88 people on death row, has condemned four times as many people to die - on a per capita basis - as the much larger Los Angeles County, California, or Harris County, Texas.

The Death Penalty Information Center claims this is largely because of Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas, who sought the death penalty in 149 cases between 2005 and 2010.

Maricopa County, Arizona, has a disproportionate number of inmates on death row compared to its population

Last year, the Arizona Supreme Court unanimously issued a ruling disbarring Thomas over corruption allegations.

The allegations didn't especially relate to his prosecution of death penalty cases, but the Death Penalty Information Center said the case proves that one man with an agenda can influence death penalty prosecutions.

The Center also pointed a finger at Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, which has 88 people on death row - the ranking third in the country.

It pointed out that even though even though the county had by far the highest number of death penalty cases in the state, its public defenders for capital cases were the lowest paid in all of Pennsylvania.

The Center says this could be one reason many Philadelphia death sentences are overturned on appeal.
