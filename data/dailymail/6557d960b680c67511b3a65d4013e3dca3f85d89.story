It was business as usual for Leo Messi as he scored a double on the first day of the season for the fourth consecutive campaign. Barcelona won their first game 3-0 against Elche despite Javier Mascherano’s red card just before the break.

Messi’s characteristic brace was achieved without the suspended Luis Suarez and the injured Neymar but he had more than enough help from Madrid born youngster Munir El Hadaddi. The young striker will not be 19 until September 1 but already has Barça fans predicting a big future – if he can stay in the side when Neymar and Suarez return.

Barcelona have now scored 26 goals in their last six opening matches and not since 2008 have they been beaten on the opening day. That front three of Munir, Rafinha and Messi was a clean sweep for the club’s La Masia youth academy as Barcelona kicked-off the season with the entire bench and six of the starters products of its youth system.

The referee blows the final whistle and it means Barcelona open up with a win.

They are also top of the league - if that's the sort of thing you read in to at this time of the season.

Can Messi get his hat-trick? No probably not - as Barcelona don't look too bothered now. We can hope though.

It's been a fine performance from Barcelona tonight - and the fans are recognising that by chanting Luis Enrique's name again.

Unsurprisingly Messi has been brilliant - but so have debutants Munir and Ivan Rakitic. This team could take a lot of stopping this season.

They have turned it down a notch now though - back into first gear for the Catalans as they see out the final minutes of the game.

Adrian comes on for Pasalic.

Sergio Roberto comes on to replace tonight's Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta. Lionel Messi takes the armband.

It's gone a little quiet here at the Nou Camp - substitute Pedro has the best chance since Messi's second goal but he is denied by the excellent Tyton.

During this lull - here's a video of the earlier 'cat' incident:

Scorer of the second goal, Munir, gets a standing ovation from the Nou Camp crowd after a brilliant debut that was capped with that great finish to tie things up at the beginning of the second half.

The 68,105-strong Catalan crowd think they've seen their next big star - and who's to argue with them after that?

Think the World Cup would leave Messi tired? You thought wrong. This time he beats three defenders - one of them twice - and slots the ball into the corner of the net.

He latched on to Dani Alves' pass inside the area and didn't look to be posing too much of a threat until some trademark close-control took him away from multiple markers and opening up the opportunity for Messi to find the corner. Brilliant goal.

Pasalic impedes Iniesta on the half-way line and goes into the referee's book.

They're not throwing players forward at will anymore but Barcelona are still creating chances. Tyton flies off his line to deny Munir with his feet after Messi plays him in on goal. In fairness to the young forward the ball was stuck under his feet and he was left with little chance to finish.

Jose Angel comes off with Alvaro replacing him.

That second goal from Munir has effectively sewn up this game in Barcelona's favour. Now they seem happy to sit on it and keep possession - and even with 10 men they're managing that with ease. Claudio Bravo still left looking for anything to do...

Two debutants combine to double the lead as the second half begins! Ivan Rakitic play in Munir with a brilliantly crafted chip and the youngster confidently fires home with a brilliant improvised finish. That should be this win sorted for Barca.

Top quality all-round.

Barcelona might have a new manager in Luis Enrique but this is very much the same from them.

80% possession, Messi on the scoresheet and looking shaky at the back - just like old times!

What a last five minutes of that half - Lionel Messi opened the scoring as he made the pressure pay but then Javier Mascherano was sent off for bringing down Garry Rodrigues when he was through on goal on Elche's only real attack.

Aside from that, the half has seen Munir El Haddadi and Andres Iniesta hit the bar - and the real star of the show: a black cat pitch invader.

That changed quickly - Garry Rodrigues somehow finds himself through on goal for the so-far blunt Elche attack and Javier Mascherano drags him down as the last man.

Referee Fernando Teixeira Vitienes had no hesitation in bringing out the red even as Mascherano pleaded his innocence. Professional foul - correct decision and Barca are down to 10.

That should make this game a bit more interesting.

The defenders can only stand and stare as Barcelona's little maestro produces a perfect first touch and runs past three of them before confidently finishing

Five years in a row he has scored on the opening night of La Liga. Easy does it.

Messi plays a brilliant slide-rule ball through to Munir. He's in a great position to shoot but perhaps the 18-year-old's inexperience showed as the tried to square it to a non-existent team-mate.

From a clever Ivan Rakitic free-kick Dani Alves, sporting a questionable new bob haircut, comes from deep to strike at goal. It goes just wide with Tyton stranded.

79% possession for Barca so far.

Barca are getting closer and closer. Messi links up with the Spanish playmaker again and he crashes a left-footed strike from range against Tyton's crossbar.

Beautiful play from the Barcelona star men. They exchange successive one-twos which bring them to the edge of the area including a couple of backheels but are eventually crowded out by the packed Elche defence.

This kid is good... Debutant Munir al Habbadi latches on to Andres Iniesta's pass, turns and instinctively shoots from just inside the area, but he hits the woodwork. A brilliant effort. Barca are getting closer.

What's that? You want more pictures of the cat? Oh, ok then.

The Catalans are already camped deep in Elche territory tonight - and Lionel Messi is dropping deep to find the gaps that could open up their defence. Eventually they make it into the Barca half a couple of times but they're heavily outnumbered. Claudio Bravo hasn't even touched the ball yet.

Luis Enrique is taking charge of his first game having previously played for Barca and after working with their youth academy.

The Nou Camp crowd sing his name.

Messi is playing provider here and he picks out Dani Alves' run to play him in on goal. Elche's new keeper Tyton comes out to deny him but brings down the Brazilian. Difficult decision made easier by the fact Alves was offside.

Barcelona have started strong - they look sharp and we've barely seen a misplaced pass so far.

With almost 10 minutes on the clock Lionel Messi goes scampering down the right wing and a brilliant turn takes him into the box before he eventually opts for a cross that doesn't quite meet the intended target.

After the cat is eventually caught the ball can come into play. Barca keeping possession early on - although is that really news?

There's a black cat doing the rounds of the Nou Camp pitch. Play has to stop and the cat keeps running on and off - stewards in pursuit but they can't get it into their clutches...

But then a man in a fluorescent jacket comes to the rescue, but ends up dropping the cat off the pitch. So, so strange. I hope Barcelona aren't superstitious....

Here we go. Elche kick us off.

Elche just about survived in La Liga last season following promotion from the Segunda division, eventually finishing just above the relegation zone in 16th.

This summer saw them lose their best player, Carlos Sanchez - now of Aston Villa - but they have made some additions including the earlier-mentioned Pasalic and former Juventus winger Milos Krasic - although he misses out tonight.

The club have big financial problems and are fifth favourites to go down this season. It could be a long night for Elche and their manager Fran Escriba.

Chelsea loanee Mario Pasalic starts for the visitors in midfield tonight in a understandably defence-focused 5-4-1 formation.

Want to know more about Pasalic? Check out Laurie Whitwell's profile of the 'next Frank Lampard' here.

Six of Barcelona's first line-up of new season homegrown including the entire front three: Messi Munir and Rafinha.

You might have heard the names of Bravo, Mathieu and Rakitic mentioned this summer but 'Munir' is a fairly unfamiliar name on that Barcelona team-sheet.

It is in fact Munir El Haddadi - another of Barca's youth academy products. An 18-year-old Spanish forward, Munir is one of Europe's hottest properties and scored a wondergoal for Barca's Under-19 side in the final of his age group's equivalent of the Champions League final. Check it out below.

Luis Enrique gives out four full debuts at the Nou Camp in a much changed Barcelona side.

Gone are the likes of Xavi (benched) and Carlos Puyol (retired) and in come the new boys. Summer signings Claudio Bravo, Jeremy Mathieu and Ivan Rakitic join academy product Munir El Haddadi in making their Barca bows.
