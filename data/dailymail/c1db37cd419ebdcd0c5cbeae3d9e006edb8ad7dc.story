A plot of land which was once a reservoir is set to be transformed into a Hobbit-style underground home and has gone on the market for £45,000.

East Riding Council granted planning permission for the quirky design last year which could pave the way for more subterranean studios.

The revolutionary plans were given the go-ahead because they will cause little impact on the landscape around it.

But to get into your new home you will have to climb down a hole in the field with the help of a ladder.

Cosy: Estate agent Oliver Hudson has been tasked with selling the unusual planned Hobbit-style home

Mr Ettridge, of Ettridge Architecture in Hessle, East Yorkshire, designed the studio.

He said: ''If you were walking by, you would have no idea that there was a house underground.

'It will look just like a field with a little hill in the middle.

'We will have to dig further underground so there's space for the kitchen but this is minimal and it will will not change the look of the landscape at all.'

Camouflaged: The design means the field will look exactly as it did when it was a working reservoir

No need for a key: To get into the home the owner will have to lift up this lid and climb down into the hole

'There just wasn't room to build a big house but it certainly makes it quirky and its size and shape means it resembles a Hobbit house.'

Mr Ettridge was approached by a private client, who bought the plot from the Yorkshire Water Board at auction three years ago and was asked to design a property.

'I couldn't say no to such a great opportunity. This really is a one-off project and I jumped at the chance to design something on the land,' he said.

'It took around three months to design and it's very compact but it has everything someone might need for a holiday let, including a kitchen and a toilet.

'The application for planning permission was previously turned down four times because it's such an unusual build but I think it was eventually accepted because it doesn't change the landscape at all.'

The studio, which is designed to be as environmentally friendly as possible, will rely on the natural temperature of the earth to heat the home.

Not for the faint-hearted: If you are scared of heights this may not be the property for you

Chris Whitelock, a renewable energy specialist at Pure Renewables, said: 'The studio will be heated by the Earth's natural temperature.

'As it is underground, it will be very well insulated by the ground and there will be very little difference in temperature in the home between summer and winter.

'The most we'll need to install is a heat pump, which will extract heat from warm areas and recirculate it, but this might not be necessary.

'There will be no windows, which will help to keep the heat in but a small tunnel connected to the ground above will transmit some natural light into the property.'

The home will have electricity produced by solar panels or micro wind turbines.

There will also be some form of running water and a toilet but it is still being decided how waste will be recycled.

Oliver Hudson, managing director at Hudson Property in Hessle, East Yorkshire, is now trying to sell the land, which is on the market at a guide price of £45,000, and it is estimated the cost of building the project will be around £35,000. 

'It will be a very unusual property and we have had a lot of interest in it. Since the plot went on the market six weeks ago, we have had around ten viewings of the reservoir and three offers on the land, but the offers haven't been quite high enough.

'It has created a lot of local interest because it's such a quirky project.

'There is a strict clause in the planning permission which states that the plot has to be used as a holiday letting because the council is keen to attract tourism to the area.

'I think people looking for a trip away will just love it and the surrounding countryside is perfect for people wanting a getaway.

'The studio will be built on a plot of land which is surrounded by a field and rolling hills, so you can't get much more idyllic than that.

'It's so unusual and so we predict it will be in high demand. It's like a quirky alternative to camping.

'This means that it is a very lucrative investment for the right buyer. You could rent a property like this for more than £400 a week so you'd get a great return. 

'We're looking for someone who will come along and give it a go.'
