A champion swimmer who used a pair of mirrored goggles to spy on a woman in a changing room cubicle walked free from court today.

Freestyle record-breaker James Mackay, 28, who has competed for Great Britain, angled the swimming goggles against a shampoo bottle so he could see into the neighbouring changing room at a leisure centre.

The married father-of-one, who was found guilty of three charges of voyeurism following a trial last month, was today ordered to pay his victim £250 compensation and £620 court costs.

Mackay, from Redditch, Worcester, who now works at a Mini dealership, was also made the subject of a 12-month supervision order and must sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for five years.

He was also banned from attending the Abbey Stadium Sports Centre for one year, but escaped a ban from other pools across the country.

Sentencing him at Redditch Magistrates 
Court, chairman of the bench Peter Sheppard told him: 'They [the 
offences] are very similar in nature, targeting one victim.

'Those 
present at the trial will have understood the significant distress of 
the victim having to come to court to give evidence.

'It took considerable courage and that should not be trivialised,' he said.

The court heard Mackay, who set the British 800m freestyle record in 2004, targeted the same woman on three separate occasions between August and September last year at the Redditch sports centre.

His victim became ‘uneasy’ when Mackay, from Redditch, spent a suspicious amount of time in the showers, as if waiting for her to return from the pool.

The woman, who cannot be named, told the trial that on the first occasion she noticed Mackay’s blue flippers and sports bottle inside a cubicle.

She chose one further away but he moved in to the dressing room next to her, when she noticed his distinctive orange and black goggles on the floor.

She said: 'I was taking my swimming costume off and put my towel round me and then I heard the door next door.

'I saw this flash of blue flippers, he had moved next to me.

'I then noticed the goggles. They were at an angle and looking into the cubicle.

'I felt uncomfortable but I thought I was being paranoid.'

On two further occasions the woman purposely chose a cubicle against a wall and blocked the middle gap with her bag, but Mackay chose the cubicle behind her.

She said: 'I started to shake and I felt no one had taken me seriously.

'I videoed the goggles so I could show the Abbey Stadium.'

JPs refused to ban him the swimmer from pools nationwide despite recommendations made by the Probation Service.

Jonathan Barker, defending, said: 'You have of course found that these offences were committed in the vicinity of a swimming pool and the great irony in this case is of course that for a significant part of Mr Mackay’s life great things have been achieved in the swimming pool.

'He has held British records for the 800 metres and 1,500 metres for the 19-24 age group.

'In 2004 he swam outdoors for Great Britain.

'For such a long period the swimming pool has been synonymous with positive things in his life and now it has negative connotations.

'Without question, making a hole and what that allows the person to see is far more invasive than using a pair of goggles and relying upon the reflection of those goggles to see what was in the next changing room.

'You must note that the defendant has chosen not to attend any swimming pools since the allegations against him have been made.

'It may comfort you to know that he has no intention of swimming in the near future,' Mr Barker added.

The court heard Mackay maintains his innocence and plans to appeal his conviction.

Both Mackay and school teacher wife Stephanie, who attended yesterday’s hearing, declined to comment outside court.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
