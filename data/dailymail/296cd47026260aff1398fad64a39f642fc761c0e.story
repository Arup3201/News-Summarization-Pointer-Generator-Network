Men who claim to like eating extremely hot chillis are only doing it to prove their masculinity, according to a new study.

Food scientists found that while women appear to eat chilli for the sensation of the burn in their mouth, men are seeking a 'social reward'.

This comes from the macho cultural associations that accompany being able to withstand the fire of the hottest chilli peppers.

The findings follow another recent study that found men who eat the spiciest foods tend to have higher levels of testosterone.

It suggests that men may be using the spiciness of food as a way of asserting their dominance over the competition.

The heat of chilli peppers is commonly measured using the Scoville heat unit scale.

This is a measure of how much chilli extract can be diluted in sugar syrup before it becomes undetectable to tasters.

Pure capsaicin, the chemical in chilli peppers that gives them their heat, measures at 16 million SHU.

Some scientists are investigating whether this chemical can be used to help people in chronic pain due to the way it binds to nerve cells.

The world's hottest chilli is the Carolina Reaper, which is rated at 2.2 million SHU, according to the Guinness Book of Records. Some of those who have tried it report taking up to 14 hours to recover from its devastating heat.

The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion is rated at 2 million SHU while the Bhut Jolokia is rated at 1.58 million SHU.

The new study also suggests that many men actually do not enjoy the stinging sensation that accompany's spicy food, while women do.

Nadia Byrnes, a sensory evaluation scientists at Pennsylvania State University and lead author of the latest study, said: 'Interestingly, the relationships between perceived burning/stinging, yearly intake of chilli-containing foods, the liking of spicy foods, and personality, were markedly different between men and women.

'Overall, men showed stronger negative correlations between perceived burning/stinging intensity and liking of spicy foods, suggesting that burning/stinging is more of a deterrent in men.

'In women, stronger positive relationships were noted between liking of spicy foods and yearly intake of chili-containing foods.' 

In the study, which is published in the journal Food Quality and Preference, the researchers asked participants to rate a number of foods on a scale to assess their preference for spiciness.

They were then given a number of liquid samples containing either sugar, quinine, salt or capsaicin, the chemical that gives chillis their heat.

They were asked to rate the sensation they experienced upon swirling these in their mouths and the results were compared to a personality test to see whether they had sensation seeking or reward seeking personalities.

Women who tended to prefer the spicier foods tended to be interested in sensations while the men who preferred hotter foods tended to be those that were more reward orientated.

Physiologists at the University of Grenoble, in France, have found that men with a taste for spicy foods tend to have higher levels of the hormone testosterone. 

The researchers tested 114 men between the ages of 18 and 44 from from Grenoble after advertising for participants to take part in food tasting panel for a food research company.

They were asked to indicate their preferences regarding spicy food and had the levels of testosterone in their saliva measured.

They were then asked to season a sample of mashed potatoes with Tabasco hot pepper sauce and salt before then evaluate the spiciness of the meal.

The researchers found that those with higher levels of testosterone tended to put more chili sauce on their potato while there did not seem to be any correlation with salt.

The scientists said it could be that the higher levels of testosterone are leading men to seek thrills and take risks by eating hotter food.

Testosterone is known to make men more adventurous, aggressive and sexually active. Those with the highest levels tend to be more dominant, or the alpha male, of a group.

The researchers believe that by eating hot curries, men may also be boosting their hormone levels as chili peppers have been shown to increase testosterone levels in rats.

The new study found that men and women eat spicy foods like the curry above for very different reasons

It suggests that men are merely attempting to show off when eating chillis while women may actually be enjoying the experience of the heat they produce.

The chemical in chilli peppers that creates heat is called capsaicin and binds with the pain receptor to produce the characteristic burning sensation.

This is known to cause physiological changes in the body, raising the heart rate, increasing perspiration and releasing endorphins and adrenalin.

It is this that produces the uncontrollable sweating  that can sometimes accompany eating really hot food but some research has also shown it can trigger the release of hormones involved in happiness.

Miss Byrnes said: 'It is possible that the cultural association of consuming spicy foods with strength and machismo has created a learned social reward for men. 

'Conversely, for women these social forces are not present, and thus intrinsic factors remain as the primary motivation for consuming spicy foods.'
