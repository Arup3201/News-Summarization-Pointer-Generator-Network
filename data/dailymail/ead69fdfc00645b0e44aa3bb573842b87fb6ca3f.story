She's brilliant in her latest film... apparently: Cate Blanchett

Next month, all eyes will turn to the Royal Opera House in London’s Covent Garden for the glittering annual Bafta film awards ceremony.

On February 16, the great and the good of the film world will walk the (usually somewhat soggy) red carpet, and prizes will be handed out for Best Actor and Actress, Best Director and, the biggie, the Best  Film of 2013.

A Bafta is one of the most prestigious prizes in the business, and winning one represents the pinnacle of most people’s careers. Even being nominated can catapult you into the major league.

And so you would imagine that the 6,500-strong voting membership of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts has a thoughtful, fair and well-considered procedure for choosing the five nominees in each category (announced last Wednesday) and then for picking the ultimate winner.

You might be surprised. 

As a Bafta voter for many years I can reveal that the voting process is based less on artistic merit than on a combination of coercion, trend-following and pot luck.

Here’s how it works. Maybe 100 films released over the past 12 months have a realistic chance of winning a Bafta, and probably 70 to 80 of those are released in the last two months of the year.

Distributors seem to think Bafta voters have short memories and, given the average age of the Bafta voter — there are a lot of retired film people in the Academy — they might be right.

So, around November, you start getting invited to screenings and Q&A sessions with cast and crew. Gone are the days of the lavish dinners and all-expenses-paid jollies — but you are certainly looked after. A Mayfair hotel. A complimentary glass of champagne. Not an inducement, of course. But we hope you enjoyed the film.

These events are expensive to put on. So already the field of competitors is being narrowed down to the Hollywood studios with their big marketing budgets.

They will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars putting adverts in the trade press, targeting voters with what are known as ‘For Your Consideration’ ads — inviting academy members to consider voting for their films and their stars. How can a low-budget independent film compete against that?

And while everyone wants to see films on the big screen, that’s not always possible. Not everyone lives in London, for one thing.

So, as the year draws to a close, you start receiving ‘screeners’. These DVDs are one of the great perks of being a Bafta member, and mean you can watch the main awards contenders in the comfort of your own home.

Previous winners: Emma Thompson and Dame Judy Dench who have both won Baftas

But still, you now have 50 or 60 films to get through. In less than a month. With Christmas in the middle. And a deadline of January 3 to vote for your five nominations in each category.

It’s just not possible to watch them all. So which ones rise to the top of the pile? The ones you’ve already heard about. And the ones that have already started winning.

From late November onwards, reviewers and film critic groups start to publish their ‘Top 10’ lists. The New York Film Critics Circle is an early big one at the start of December, followed by the American National Board Of Review a few days later, and the Golden Globe nominations a week after that.

(Can you see a pattern emerging? The Americans are already setting the pace.)This year, films such as 12 Years A Slave, Gravity and American Hustle got a lot of early momentum. Other much-hyped films such as The Great Gatsby or August: Osage County started to fall away.

Lupita Nyong’o from 12 Years A Slave was hailed early on as a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actress, and now looks set to claim the Bafta. Old favourite Bruce Dern was hailed the comeback king for his Best Actor role in the little-seen Nebraska, and sure enough he has bagged a Bafta nomination.

So, very quickly, the front-runners are anointed. And they ride that wave all the way to the Baftas and beyond.

The point is clear. We’re sheep. And we follow the sheep in front of us. And the little guys fall by the wayside.

But the days are still ticking by, and you still have all these films to watch, and you’ve been meaning to get to them but you can’t, and there are all these obvious front-runners . . .

And so you do it. You vote for a film you haven’t seen.

Let’s be clear. Bafta voting guidelines state explicitly that you must only vote for films you have seen. Which makes perfect sense. But I’ve done it. And I bet everyone else has, too. You vote for the ones you think are going to win.

It’s why the same old names appear year after year.

On February 16, the great and the good of the film world will walk the red carpet, before Bafta awards are handed out

Judi Dench could blow her nose and she’d get nominated (she famously won a Bafta for her eight minutes of screen time as Elizabeth I in Shakespeare In Love).

Emma Thompson, check. Tom Hanks, check. Kate Winslet, hmm, she wasn’t in a movie this year, can I vote for her anyway?

Are these really the crowning performances of their careers? No, but they’ll get nominated anyway.

And because we’re British we’ll throw a few bones to British films such as Philomena (about a woman’s search for her long-lost son) or the motor-racing drama Rush — both wonderful movies, as it happens, but a little national pride goes a long way at the Baftas.

Voting is done online now, and it takes five minutes. Click, click, click. I voted for Cate Blanchett because apparently she’s amazing in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine.

And it’ll be great if she turns up to the awards. And having Woody films on the shortlist makes Bafta look smarter.

Cate’s practically British anyway. And I’m sure I’ll get round to seeing it one day.

I voted for Martin Scorsese. I haven’t seen The Wolf Of Wall Street but everyone knows Scorsese is a film-making genius and I have no doubt that his latest is up to his usual breathtakingly high standard.

Click, click, send. It’s that easy.

You back winners, and winners are the ones with momentum, and momentum is generated by marketing muscle, pure and simple.

Hang on, you say. How does The Artist, a French black-and-white film with no dialogue, win the Bafta for Best Picture in 2012? Exactly the same way, with momentum. 

The king of the ‘Awards Push’ is American mogul Harvey Weinstein, who, along with his brother Bob, has helped his films win 75 Oscars in the past 20 years.

He saw The Artist, bought it, and ran a textbook campaign, pitching it as ‘The Little Film That Could’. Boy, could it ever.

There are two problems at play here. The first is this insistence on pushing out every quality movie in the last two months of the year. It overloads us, and leaves cinemas empty of decent material the rest of the time. 

The Olivier Theatre Awards, the Costa Book Awards, the Turner Prize for art can all take a year’s worth of work and examine it in a more considered fashion, and with an element of perspective. Can’t the film industry do the same?

But the second is more worrying. Bafta is still happy — desperate even — to be seen as the Oscars’ younger brother, the penultimate awards ceremony in a months-long bandwagon leading up to the big daddy.

So Hollywood stars turn up to a ceremony they might otherwise avoid, and TV ratings boom.

It’s why we work to these crazy timelines, why we still vote for so many American movies in the British Academy Awards, and why relatively few home-grown films get recognised.

Surely we are a big enough country to define for ourselves what is worthy of praise, rather than following the lead of the Americans?

But maybe the system does work, after all. I voted for 12 Years A Slave in several categories and I confidently predict it will win big at both the Baftas and the Oscars.

As it should — considering it’s the best film of the year. At least, so I’m told.
