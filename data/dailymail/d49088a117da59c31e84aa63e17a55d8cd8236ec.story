In the Sixties, George Harrison penned 'Blue Jay Way' and experimented with LSD along with the other Beatles in the build-up to their 1967 Magical Mystery Tour album in his house in Esher Surrey. 

And now a six-bedroom mansion - built near to where Harrison's colourful bungalow 'Kinfauns' once stood – is on the market for almost £10million.

While not a part of the 'Blue Jay' property, the words 'I love George', carved into a wooden gate in the driveway by an obsessed fan, are still visible today at the entrance.

Harrison lived in the bungalow from 1964 to 1970 and felt so inspired by the book Tantrum Art that he painted the  outside  in psychedelic patterns with the help of his first wife Patti Boyd.

'Blue'Jay boasts a swimming pool, games room and 700-bottle  wine cellar has been built on the land in Claremont Park Estate.

'Blue Jay claims some celebrity status. In the sixties the driveway to the property formed part of the gardens to Beatle George Harrison's country house "Kinfauns",' said Savills' Trevor Kearney.

John Lennon and Yoko Ono retreated to Kinfauns during their first LSD trip in 1965 with Harrison and his first wife. 

The Beatles recorded a number of demos at the colourful bungalow after a stay at the Maharishi’s ashram in Rishikesh, India. 

These became known as the  Kinfauns Demos or Esher Demos and they feature a number of hits that  eventually made it onto the White Album. 

They also feature early versions of Paul McCartney's 'Junk', which would later appear on his 1970 solo record  and Lennon's 'Jealous Guy' (then called 'Child of Nature'), which was released on his 1971 album Imagine.

The mansion has a gym, library, formal dining room, en-suite staff accommodation and a four-car garage with under floor heating. It is on the market for £9.9million.

'A gymnasium with wall to ceiling glass sliding doors overlooks the swimming pool, opening out onto a timber decking area that features an illuminated circular staircase leading down to the pool side bar and sauna areas,' said a spokesman.

Harrison's song 'Blue Jay Way' with the famous opening lyric 'There's a fog upon LA' was inspired by a stay at 1567 Blue Jay Way (pictured) in the Hollywood Hills in 1967

The six-bedroom mansion has a formal dining room with a modern fireplace, reception room and a patio area to enjoy al-fresco meals 

'The circular atrium is also reflected in the curved banquette seating in the formal reception room, continuing this theme through to the stunning bespoke kitchen and the breath-taking double height indoor swimming pool complex.'

Harrison's song 'Blue Jay Way' with the famous opening lyric 'There's a fog upon LA' was inspired by a stay at 1567 Blue Jay Way in the Hollywood Hills in 1967.

According to legend Harrison was sitting in the home playing his organ while waiting for someone to pick him up and in those brief moments inspiration struck, and his hit song was written.

It was first recorded and released by the Beatles on their Magical Mystery Tour album and EP in 1967.

The majestic home overlooks Los Angeles and is within the Bird Streets, a residential area known to be an exclusive enclave popular with celebrities.

From luxury mansions in the English countryside to a sweeping ranch in Colorado, properties lived in by John, Paul, George and Ringo attract huge interest.

But as well as the glamorous abodes, even their humble childhood homes manage to generate excitement among fans.

Just weeks ago the Liverpool house where Sir Paul McCartney lived as a child sold in six minutes at auction to an anonymous local buyer for £150,000.

The childhood home of Sir Paul McCartney (pictured centre) sold for £150,000 in just six minutes  - and for more than double the average price for a property on the road in the Speke area of Liverpool

The terraced home in Western Avenue, Speke, was where the musician lived with his parents from 1947 until the mid-1950s.

In October, a home where George Harrison spent some of his youth - also in Speke - was snapped up at auction by a super fan.

Beatles fanatic Jackie Holmes, from London, bought the Liverpool property for £156,000 at the auction which took place at Liverpool's Cavern Club.

The property in Upton Green, was home to the musician during Beatle-mania and was a popular hang-out for the band during their early years. 

A year earlier, John Lennon's childhood home at 9 Newcastle Road in Wavertree, sold at auction for £480,000.

In December, it was reported that Ringo Starr and his wife were trying to find a buyer for his $3.85million Colorado ranch (pictured)

As Beatlemania took off, members of the Fab Four were soon seen in upmarket properties around the globe. And in recent years, luxury homes they have occupied have continued to hit the headlines.

In December, it was reported that Ringo Starr and his wife had put his country estate in Surrey on the market for more than $20million - and that he was also trying to find a buyer for his $3.85million Colorado ranch. 

The ranch, located about 30 minutes outside Aspen in Woody Creek on 15.8 acres, sits on the banks of the Roaring Fork River and has three bedrooms, a living room that features vaulted ceilings, exposed wood beams and a neat rock fireplace. 

Last year a three-bedroom flat in Knightsbridge shared by George Harrison and Ringo Starr at the height of Beatlemania went on the market for £2.5million

The 17th-century Surrey estate sits on 200 acres of land, and was purchased for just $3.1million by Starr in 1999.

Last year a three-bedroom flat shared by George Harrison and Ringo Starr at the height of Beatlemania went on the market for £2.5million.

The musicians moved into the apartment in Knightsbridge in 1964 - the year of their first world tour. The pair - who shared with Harrison's then girlfriend, model Pattie Boyd - also briefly lived in two other flats in the central London apartment building.

In 2013, a bohemian home in the Hollywood Hills where John Lennon once stayed went on the market for $1million.
