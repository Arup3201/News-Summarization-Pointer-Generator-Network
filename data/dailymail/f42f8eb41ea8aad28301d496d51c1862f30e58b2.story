A heartbroken father claims a police officer shot his family’s dog ‘in cold blood’ in a gruesome act by a local police officer - all caught by his home security cameras.

Raul Ayala of Lyman, Nebraska, said he had gone into town on September 22 with his wife and children, leaving his 18-month-old Rottweiler, Bos, in the yard.

He later received a call from his brother-in-law, saying that he had heard shots being fired and went to the house to find Bos was dead.

Mourning: Raul Ayala says his dog Bos was murdered 'in cold blood' by a police officer, who shot the animal about four times

Shots fired: Mr Ayala's security video shows the officer firing several shots at the dog, who can be seen spinning in place before collapsing

After returning to his house, Mr Ayala looked at his home security tapes, where he saw the officer fire about four shots from close range. 

Bos can be seen spinning in place before collapsing and writhing on the sidewalk.

The video was also posted on YouTube on October 14 by Pittsburgh Cop Block, an organisation dedicated to naming and shaming police officers believed to have used excessive force or brutality.

Cruel? As the dog lay dying, Officer Huffman can be seen dragging its body to the grass

Mr Ayala told the Star-Herald that the cop 'murdered my dog in cold blood.'

The police officer, Ray Huffman of the Lyman Police Department, claimed that he had only shot Bos after pepper spray was ineffective - and that the dog had lunged at him.

A post on the ‘Justice for Bos Ayala’
 Facebook page reads: 'He protected us with all he had he wasn't just a 
dog he was more like family my baby who didn’t deserve what happen 
(sic).'

Family tragedy: The Ayala family looked to Bos as a guard dog

Also on the video, 
the officer comes into the shot as Bos lays dying, grabs the animal by 
one of his back legs, and drags him off to the side.

He then takes a hose that was hanging nearby and uses it to rinse the blood off the concrete. He tosses the hose on the ground just before the video ends.

Police said that Huffman washed the blood away because he did not want the family to see it.

The family is now calling for Huffman’s dismissal from the Lyman Police Department.

But the village won’t budge, saying that it has numerous witnesses 'who saw the dog acting aggressively and that it was not the first time.'

The Village of Lyman said in a statement that it ‘supports the actions taken by Officer Huffman and will defend such actions unless it is proven that Officer Huffman acted negligently in his duties as a police officer.'

But Ayala claims the security tape shows that the village is wrong, and that the shooting was not justified. 

Mr Ayala told the Star Herald: 'Nothing in the Village of Lyman’s statement is consistent with what is shown on my video. Furthermore, nothing said by Mr Huffman is consistent with what is being shown on my video.'
