Ridley Scott's new biblical epic 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' has been banned in Egypt because of 'historical inaccuracies'.

The head of the censorship board said these included a claim that the Pyramids were built by Jews, and that an earthquake, not a miracle by Moses, caused the parting of the Red Sea.

Morocco has also reportedly banned the film, which stars Christian Bale as Moses, despite the fact that state-run Moroccan Cinema Centre (CCM) gave the movie the green light. 

Cinema owners in Morocco claimed that they were given a 'verbal' directive to not show the movie by the CCM on Wednesday - just a day before its planned release.

Hassan Belkady, said he was threatened with the closure of his multiplex, Cinema Rif in Casablanca, if he didn't comply. 

'They phoned and threatened they would shut down the theatre if I did not take the film off the schedule,' he said.

The film tells the story of Moses rising up in defiance against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, setting 600,000 slaves on a journey of escape amid a series of plagues.

Moses is considered a prophet in Islam which is the predominant religion in Egypt and Morocco. The religion is opposed to visual depictions of its prophets.

Mr Scott has already come under fire over the decision to cast white actors in the lead roles, despite depicting events in the Middle East and north Africa

The managers of the Renaissance cinema in Rabat said they were told the ban was nationwide, TelQuel magazine reported.

Mr Scott has already come under fire over the decision to cast white actors in the lead roles, despite depicting events in the Middle East and north Africa.

The veteran British film-maker who directed Gladiator and Alien said casting on his Moses epic was predicated on the need to attract financial backing. 

Christian Bale, who plays Moses, caused upset last month after he described his character as 'barbaric' and 'schizophrenic' at a press conference.

Speaking in Los Angeles, Bale said he had undertaken significant research for the role in the Biblical epic, reading the Torah, the Koran and Jonathan Kirsch's life of Moses.

The actor said: 'I think the man was likely schizophrenic and was one of the most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life.'

Mr Bale also said he was surprised by the complexity of the Old Testament figure – and his creator. 

CCM chief Sarim Fassi-Fihri declined to comment on the decision.

Biblical epics have made a comeback this year with Darren Aronofsky's Noah and Son of God from the producers of the highly successful TV series The Bible.
