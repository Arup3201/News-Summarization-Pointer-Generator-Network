West Ham have made a bid to take Boca Juniors left-back Emanuel Insua on loan.

Manager Sam Allardyce, who also has an interest Manchester United's Wilfried Zaha and Ashley Young, officially welcomed new arrival Enner Valencia in a £12m deal from Pachuca on Thursday and has turned to the South American market once again with Insua.

The 23-year-old is the younger brother of former Liverpool defender Emiliano and is valued at around £4million.

West Ham had asked about Dnipro's Croatia left-back Ivan Strinic but that has fallen through and Boca may yet reject a loan offer for Insua preferring a permanent sale.

Allardyce wants Stuttgart defender Antonio Rudiger and another midfielder.

They have been offered Saphir Taider, 22, from Inter Milan and are keen to explore other loan options such as United's Young and Zaha who Louis van Gaal may yet make available.

On the list: Man United's Wilfried Zaha is also attracting West Ham's attention
