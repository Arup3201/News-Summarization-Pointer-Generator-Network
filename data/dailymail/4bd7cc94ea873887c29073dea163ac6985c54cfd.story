River Plate want to sign Sunderland striker Ignacio Scocco.

The 28-year-old only joined in January from Internacional but Boca Juniors and Newell's Old Boys are also keen to take him back to South America.

Scocco played just six games under Gus Poyet, not managing to score a goal.

Brief spell: Ignacio Scocco is set to return to Argentina after just six months with Sunderland

Rewarded: Connor Wickham is to be given a new contract at the Stadium of Light

Sunderland are poised to open talks over a new contract for striker Connor Wickham.

Wickham, unlike Scocco, helped the Black Cats to Premier League survival with some crucial goals, after loan spells at several Championship clubs.
