It seems that Hyde FC can boast the strongest left-wing in the land after they fielded a team made-up entirely of socialist revolutionaries in a pre-season friendly.

Well that is how it appeared according to their Twitter account anyway as they released a line-up containing Karl Marx, Fidel Castro and Tony Blair because they could not name the triallists on display.

Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and Tony Benn were also giving a starting place, while Mahatma Ghandi and Che Guevara could only make the bench against Altrincham on Saturday.Â 

Left-wingers: Karl Marx (left) and Che Guevara (right) were two of the pseudonyms of socialist revolutionaries that were used by Hyde FC during their pre-season friendly with Altrincham to replace triallists' names

Revolutionary: Hyde FC's Twitter account have used pseudonyms instead of triallists names on Twitter

TV: Games of Thrones characters were used for one friendly, and socialist revolutionaries for another

Benched: The tongue-in-cheek inclusion of Tony Blair as a left-wing revolutionary saw him only make the bench

It was a strike from Hyde's Steven Tames, and not from any of his revolutionary team-mates, that broke the deadlock before Friedrich Engels popped up with a second in a 2-2 draw.

Hyde's official Twitter account replaced the names of triallists during their match against Mossley on Tuesday as well, but on that occasion they used Game of Thrones characters as pseudonyms.

Household names from the popular HBO programme who were supposedly on display included Jon Snow, Jaime Lannister and The Hound.

Unfortunately the 'cast' from Games of Thrones succumbed to a 4-2 defeat away at Mossley despite strikes from Lannister and Hyde's Josh Brizell.

The Greater Manchester club were relegated from the Conference Premier last season after finished bottom of the league and will look to bounce back at the first time of asking from the Conference North this campaign.
