Tragedy: The heartbroken mother of Harley Pascoe, who had a heart defect, told his inquest five operations were cancelled because of a lack of hospital beds

A baby born with half a heart died at a children’s hospital after his operation was cancelled five times because of a lack of beds, an inquest heard.

Harley Pascoe survived for just 12 days after he was born as the surgery was repeatedly delayed.

After the operation to have a device fitted in his heart to help blood flow to his lungs was put off four times, doctors realised his condition was deteriorating.

He was upgraded to the status of ‘emergency patient’ but the operation was postponed yet again.

When Harley finally underwent the procedure, doctors were forced to perform it twice because he suffered a cardiac arrest on the operating table.

After six hours in theatre – for a procedure which would normally take 90 minutes – Harley was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, but died hours later after suffering another cardiac arrest.

He is among 13 children who have died or become seriously ill since 2008 after treatment on Ward 32, the hospital’s cardiac unit. A series of inquiries into the ward have led to allegations of neglect and mistreatment.

Yesterday Harley’s mother Danielle Gatehouse, 23, said she was repeatedly told her baby was not a priority case.

In a statement, the book-keeper said: ‘The day before his first scheduled operation, we were told it was not going to go ahead as they had no available beds.

‘His next operation didn’t go ahead again due to a lack of beds in the PICU. We were told he was stable and not considered an emergency.’

Flax Bourton Coroner’s Court, near Bristol, heard Harley had pulmonary artesia, a congenital heart condition. Miss Gatehouse and her partner Lee Pascoe, 30, of Fraddon, Cornwall, were told he would require an operation shortly after he was born. Miss Gatehouse gave birth on September 19 at St Michael’s Hospital, Bristol.

Harley, who weighed 7lb 7oz, was immediately taken to the PICU before being transferred to Ward 32 four days later.

Operations were cancelled on September 26 and the three subsequent days. On September 30, Harley underwent an echocardiogram which showed the duct in his heart was closing, and he was upgraded to ‘emergency patient’ status.

Despite being prepped for surgery, Harley’s parents were told it would not take place and would be re-booked for 8.30am the next day.

During the procedure on October 1, surgeons were forced to replace the shunt when it became blocked and Harley fell into cardiac arrest.

Once the problems had been rectified, he was finally taken back on to the PICU at around 3.30pm in a stable condition. But again his condition deteriorated and at 11.27pm he suffered an ‘unexpected cardiac arrest’ and doctors were unable to revive him.

The inquest heard that although the operation was deemed urgent, the delay would not have led to Harley’s death.

Consultant cardiac surgeon Serban Stoica said: ‘This situation became an emergency but we thought it would be better to do it the next day.’ He added: ‘I don’t think the delay would have contributed to Harley’s death’

Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Maria Voisin said Harley died following ‘necessary surgery’ for complex congenital heart disease.

Harley’s family said they were contributing to an independent review into the hospital by Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of the NHS.

A spokesman for University Hospitals Bristol said: ‘We would like to repeat our sincere condolences to Harley Pascoe’s family.

‘Harley’s surgery had to be rescheduled to accommodate children needing treatment more urgently and we understand how distressing this must have been for his parents.

‘The coroner found that this did not contribute to his death.’
