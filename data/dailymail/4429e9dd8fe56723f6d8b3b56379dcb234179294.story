A former high school tutor in Michigan accused of having a consensual sexual relationship with a student had a fiery exchange with the prosecuting attorney on Monday in the combative conclusion to a real-life courtroom drama.

The weeping defendant Abigail Simon, 35, insisted she was the victim in her relationship with the 15-year-old boy and during one of her aggressive exchanges with Assistant Kent County Prosecutor Helen Brinkman even declared, 'I'll never forgive you!'

It was a scene so unusually emotional that even Judge Paul Sullivan was having trouble dealing with it. 'This thing is totally out of control.' the judge told his courtroom. 'I've tried to be patient but I'm beginning to lose it.'

Emotional: Accused sexual predator Abigail Simon strikes a pained pose in court on Monday as an emotional exchange erupted between her and prosecuting attorney Helen Brinkman

'I'll never forgive you!': Simon accused Brinkman's client of lying. Her defense spins upon the argument that she is the victim and was manipulated by a 15-year-old student

Out of control: At one point Simon mouthed 'I want to go home' during questioning. Even the fed up judge declared to the courtroom 'this thing is totally out of control.'

'I want to go home,' Simon mouthed to her attorney at one point as she sat at the stand, the last witness in the two-week courtroom saga.

'Did you tell anybody he forced you or threatened you before you were caught?' Brinkman asked.

'No, I said that 1,000 times already,' Simon said.

'I'm not sitting up here lying like your client,' shouted at Brinkman at one point.

According to MLive.com, Brinkman accused Simon of 'mirroring' the boy’s victimization as a means of defending herself.

The dramatic interaction brought the trial to a memorable close on Monday, with the jury expect to begin deliberations sometime Tuesday. 

Throughout the proceedings, lawyers for the 35-year-old former tutor are tried to convince a jury the teenager 'stalked, coerced and brutalized' the woman into sleeping with him.

The boy, who was 15 when he allegedly had a short but intense fling with Abigail Simon over spring in 2013, would undergo two days of cross-examination.

In that time he was pressed on the more than 1,000 text messages exchanged between himself and Simon as the defense attempted to show he was no victim.

However the prosecution used the same texts to depict Simon as a predator who went after an innocent virgin, according to M Live.

Simon was fired from her position as a tutor and study hall supervisor at Catholic Central and West Catholic high schools after the boy's mother found pictures of Simon in a garter belt on her son's phone.

Simon and the alleged victim referred to each other in pet names, the teen testified last week.

He said Simon called him 'boo' and he called his former tutor 'baby girl', according to Wood TV.

The teen - now 17 - said their relationship was consensual and that they both knew it was wrong.

One of the texts from Simon to the boy read: 'I’m scared that you’re only 15.'

The pair were allegedly together between February 1 and April 26 of last year.

Almost all of their encounters allegedly took place at Simon's apartment in the 300 block of Bridge Street North West in Grand Rapids.

Prosecutors read a text from Simon that she sent while on spring break in Florida, Wood TV reported.

Simon told the teen he should be with girls his age, saying: 'I’m just too old, as much as that stinks.'

However the victim refused, begging Simon in another text: 'Please give me one more chance.'

The teen started undergoing questioning on Monday November 17.

He denied that he slapped Simon before they started having sex with each other and laughed at suggestions he stalked Simon.

Simon is charged with first-degree sexual assault and accosting a minor for immoral purposes.
