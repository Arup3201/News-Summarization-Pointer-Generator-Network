Parents in Missouri City, Texas are calling for a school bus driver to be sacked after the woman abandoned their children and threw the keys at one of the students, saying: 'How about you drive the bus home'.

The driver has not officially been identified, but one mother told MailOnline that the kids called her Ms Sylvia.

On Thursday, the Fort Bend Independent School District said it is investigating the incident which happened Tuesday while Ms Sylvia was taking home Baines Middle School students.

Stormed out: A Texas bus driver may be fired after abandoning middle school students when she became upset over how loud they were being Tuesday afternoon. She was photographed by one of the students outside the bus where she waited an hour for a replacement driver

'How about you drive the bus home': Baines Middle School student Morgan Billingsley says the driver threw the keys at her when she asked where she was going

School district officials say the driver 'got upset' with the 12 students on board, who were apparently being loud.

Student Morgan Billingsley was on the bus at the time and told KTRK that Ms Sylvia pulled the bus over on a busy bridge and started packing her purse. 

After Morgan asked what she was doing, Ms Sylvia threw the keys at her and said, 'How about you drive the bus home'.

The shocked student took a picture holding the keys and of Ms Sylvia standing outside the bus, where she waited an hour for a replacement driver.

Evidence: After the driver stormed off the bus, Morgan took pictures of her waiting outside and the keys that she was given. Many of the parents were forced to pick their kids up at the parked bus when it took a replacement driver an hour to get there

Morgan's mother Reshonda Tate Billingsley told MailOnline that some parents ended up picking their children up from the parked bus, which was on the main road that leads into a very populated residential community.

And this isn't the first time the kids have had a run-in with Ms Sylvia.

A few months ago parents wrote letters complaining about the white driver after she allegedly called the black kids on the bus n*****s, Ms Billingsley said.

The incident happened when some of the kids on the bus started singing a song called 'Shrimp Fried Rice' which they found on YouTube.

The driver got angry, parked the bus and had all of the non-black kids get off the bus, Ms Billingsley was told by her daughter.

Frustrated: Morgan's mother Reshonda Tate Billingsley and other parents are calling for the driver to be fired. Allegedly the driver had also called the black children on the bus the n-word before

She then allegedly told the students: 'You shouldn't sing that song. That song is racist. You guys are all n*****s and how would you like it if I called you a n*****.'

Ms Billingsley says her daughter and the other children were shocked.

While Ms Billingsley and other parents complained about that incident, she says there have been near daily problems and that many of the students were afraid of the woman who was 'yelling and erratic all of the time'.

'We blew it off for the longest time because we just thought they were kids complaining,' she said.

'We know that woman's job is hard. We blew them off, but everyday it was something new.'

But Tuesday's incident was the final straw for the parents who are now calling for Ms Sylvia to be fired.

'To say I'm appalled is an understatement. It is one thing to be frustrated by kids. I completely get that, but you are in a position where you are supposed to be trained to deal with unruly noisy children. She does not need to be working with children,' Ms Billingsly told KPRC.

The school district says Ms Sylvia wasn't fired after the n-word incident, but that they will take that into account when deciding what to do about her actions Tuesday.

Ms Sylvia has not yet been fired, but has been suspended from driving buses pending the investigation.

School district officials issued a statement Thursday saying they regret what happened and will take the appropriate action.
