Kyle Walker has backed Tottenham to finally finish above north London rivals Arsenal and bring Champions League football back to White Hart Lane.

Spurs were beaten 2-1 by Crystal Palace on Saturday, but it was a defeat that ended a run of form that had seen Mauricio Pochettino's side go unbeaten for seven Premier League matches.

Included in that run was a 5-3 win against table-topping Chelsea - only their second defeat of the season - and a draw against top-four rivals Manchester United.

Tottenham have not finished above Arsenal in the league for 19 years, but Walker insists the squad has more than enough quality to match the Gunners this season.

'Arsenal are always going to be up there as they have fantastic players but so have we,' Walker was quoted as saying on standard.co.uk. 'We've got a dressing room full of internationals and good-quality players, who have shown this season what they can do.'

Spurs have only ever competed in Europe's top club competition once - under Harry Redknapp in the 2010-11 season, when they beat Inter Milan and AC Milan on their way to a quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid - and the England full back believes they can break the top four again.

'Champions League is where every player wants to be but the way we're going now, I think we can get there. I don't want to jinx anything but if we play as we did when we beat Chelsea 5-3, why can't we do it?'

Tottenham have been notoriously poor against the big teams in recent seasons, but the club's form against them this campaign has given Walker cause for optimism.

'In recent seasons, we'd struggle to pick up points against the top teams and that's where we were struggling to bridge the gap but this season we've beaten Chelsea, drawn with Manchester United and Arsenal.'
