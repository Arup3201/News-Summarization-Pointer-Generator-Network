'Angry': Ann Carr launched the attack after a night out in Derby to celebrate turning 37

A woman stabbed a man in the back with a kitchen knife for eating her takeaway burger and chips after a night out to celebrate her 37th birthday.

Ann Carr had bought the food as she made her way back to her home in Allenton, Derby, with a group of people at the end of the night.

A court heard the group continued the celebrations back at the house, but the atmosphere quickly soured when Carr realised one of her guests had eaten 'a lot' of her chicken burger and chips.

The 37-year-old, who had gone into her bedroom to remove her make-up, was infuriated when she returned to find her takeaway partially eaten.

Carr pushed the remnants of the food into the face of one onlooker, then fetched a 'large kitchen knife and lunged' at the man who had eaten the burger.

The attack damaged muscles around the man's spine and left him with a 3cm wound, the court heard.

The victim has had trouble walking and suffered nightmares in the wake of the incident, the court was told.

Hal Ewing, prosecuting at Derby Crown Court, said the atmosphere had initially been good at Carr's home, where the group had played music and continued drinking.

But he said Carr became angry and launched the attack when she returned from cleaning her face to discover her half-eaten takeaway.

The defendant, who has battled with alcoholism, had taken drugs on the night of her birthday, the court heard.

Carr was jailed for 20 months for wounding after admitting the attack on September 1 last year.

'It was most disgraceful to have caused a nasty wound to his back,' Judge Andrew Hamilton said.

'If you had stuck it in a bit further, it could have caused even worse injuries.

Takeaway: Carr attacked the man for eating her chicken burger and chips

'So long as you continue to take drugs and drink, you will continue to be at risk of causing serious harm to people,' the judge added.

Carr had been placed on a curfew for more than 120 days but half of that will be taken off her prison sentence. The court was told she had a previous conviction for assault dating back to in 1996.

Clive Stockwell, mitigating, told the court Carr had had a tragic early life.

He said: 'Her mother died when she was a teenager and she had also lost her father and a brother.

'As a result, she consumed a great deal of alcohol to deal with these emotional problems and she became an alcoholic.

'On this night, she went out for her birthday and foolishly decided to take some drugs.

'She is a vulnerable person and has dealt with a lot in her life,' Mr Stockwell added.The judge studied a psychiatric report on Carr before jailing her.
