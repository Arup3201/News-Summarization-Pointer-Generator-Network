Innocent child: Chance after chance was missed to save murdered four-year-old Daniel Pelka, a report found today

The former children's chief who was blasted for failings by his former council over murdered schoolboy Daniel Pelka has stepped down from his new child protection post.

Colin Green retired as director of children's services at Coventry City Council at the end of last month -  and promptly took up up the post of independent chairman of Tower Hamlets Safeguarding Children Board in London.

However, he has now decided to withdraw from the post of chairman of the Local Safeguarding Children Board 'with immediate effect' - just two days after the move was announced.

The news comes the same week a serious case review into the death of four-year-old Daniel Pelka found key opportunities were missed to intervene in his case by the city's children's services team, together with health professionals, school staff, police and other child protection agencies.

Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP for the area of Coventry where Daniel and his family lived, said he was 'stunned' when the news of Mr Green's appointment broke, which he claimed was 'an affront to public opinion'.

He also called on the chief executive of the city council Martin Reeves, who this week apologised for the council's failings, to state what he knew of Mr Green's appointment and asked whether the council provided him with a reference for the job.

Mr Robinson had said he planned to raise the appointment with the Government.

Today, a spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council said: 'The new chair of Tower Hamlets Local Safeguarding Children Board, Colin Green, has decided to withdraw from the post with immediate effect.'

The London borough council said Mr Green had been appointed by a multi-agency panel in June with all such decisions 'based on the merits of each applicant'.

Daniel died of a head injury in March 2012, after a systematic campaign of emotional and physical abuse by his mother Magdelena Luczak and brutal former soldier and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, both originally from Poland.

Colin Green, head of Coventry's children's services, pictured right, that let down murdered schoolboy Daniel Pelka was awarded a new role in London.  Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP for the area of Coventry where Daniel and his family lived, pictured left, said he was 'stunned' at the news

He was beaten, suffering a broken arm which needed hospital treatment, and arrived at school one day with two black eyes.

He
was also kept locked in a box room at home, fed salt, and starved to 
the point where he stole food from other pupils' lunchboxes and raided 
school bins for scraps at playtime.

Despite these signs, the serious case 
review report authors found that nobody had ever spoken to Daniel 
independently about his home life nor acted decisively to intervene in 
his care.

It also found the 
child protection agencies had been taken in by the 'web of lies' spun by
Daniel's mother and stepfather, and should instead have been 'thinking 
the unthinkable' about what was really going on.

The
serious case review by Coventry Safeguarding Children Board, published 
on Tuesday, concluded the young boy had become almost 'invisible' to the
people who were supposed to protect children from abuse and recommended
improvements to working practices, record-keeping and inter-agency 
communication. 

Callous: Magdelena Luczak, the mother of Daniel 
Pelka, and Mariusz Krezolek, his stepfather of Daniel Pelka battered him
to death after subjecting him to systematic starvation and 
'incomprehensible' cruelty

All agencies involved said they had learned lessons to avoid another case like Daniel's happening again.

Luczak
and Krezolek were jailed for a minimum of 30 years each after being 
found guilty of the defenceless youngster's murder in a trial at 
Birmingham Crown Court this year.

Mr Robinson, who had previously called on Mr Green to resign despite reports he was already planning to retire, said: 'Like myself, I am sure the whole of Coventry will be stunned to learn that Colin Green, former director of children's services at Coventry City Council has gone off to become chair of the safeguarding children board at Tower Hamlets.

'This is a clear example of senior 
civil servants operating their own network for the benefit of 
themselves, at the expense of front-line staff who have faced the real 
challenges on a daily basis.

'The appointment is an affront to public opinion and confirms that I was right to call for a wholly independent inquiry.

'These boards are not truly independent.'

Schoolboy: Little Heath Primary School in Coventry, West Midlands, where Daniel Pelka was a pupil. He used to scavenge food from bins in the weeks before he died because he was so hungry

He
added: 'Martin Reeves, Coventry City Council's chief executive, should 
state publicly whether he knew of the appointment before it was made and
whether he or any of his senior staff provided a reference for Mr 
Green.

'I shall be meeting 
with Edward Timpson, minister for children and families, in the near 
future and will raise this appointment with him as well as my concerns.'

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Local safeguarding children boards are independent of government - appointments are made by the chief executive of the local council.'

He added the minister had already met with the MP.

A spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council said: 'We can confirm that a new chair has been appointed to Tower Hamlets Safeguarding Children Board.

'The multi-agency appointments panel sat in June 2013 and all appointment decisions are based on the merits of each applicant, their suitability for the post and information available at the time.'

Mr Robinson has applied to have an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on the wider issues surrounding Daniel's death.

He has also called for a clearer line of responsibility for reporting for people with concerns about child abuse or neglect.

There have also been calls for a public debate on whether a change in the law is needed, placing a mandatory legal duty on anyone who works with children to report their suspicions of child abuse.

Local safeguarding children boards were introduced under the Children Act 2004 and bring together representatives from health, education, social and children's services and other agencies responsible for protecting children from the area where they operate, and are chaired by an independent person.

The boards' aims are to foster greater co-operation between the different agencies, leading to better joined-up working, improving the safeguarding and welfare of vulnerable children.Another key role of such boards is to carry out serious case reviews whenever a child dies where there is a suspicion of abuse or neglect.
