Britain has been warned to batten down the hatches with high winds and torrential rain set to sweep across the country over the next few days.

Forecasters are predicting around 10mm of rain could fall in an hour in parts of the south and west today, tomorrow and into the weekend.

Gusts will reach around 50mph along the south coast over the next two days as a series of banks of cloud move in from the Atlantic.

Gusts of up to 50mph are expected to hit the south coast today, tomorrow and into the weekend

Forecaster Leon Brown, from The Weather Channel, told the Daily Express the end of the week and start of the weekend would see a lot of wet weather.

He said: 'It will be quite windy over southern coasts with strong winds and husts up to 50mph.

'More scattered and thundery showers are expected for central and northern Britain.'

Flood alerts have been issued as forecasters warn showers could dump up 10mm an hour in some parts

The Environment Agency has issued 13 flood alerts in the south east in areas of Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Hampshire.

The Met Office has not issued any severe weather warnings but says it is expecting an unsettled weekend with a risk of gales and rain in all areas.

The wetter, windier weather will come as a shock for those many parts of the country, which have experienced days of unbroken sunshine and high temperatures in recent weeks.

Jim Dale, of the British Weather Service, said the colder weather could stay into the middle of May and warned: 'The next 10 days are looking cooler.'
