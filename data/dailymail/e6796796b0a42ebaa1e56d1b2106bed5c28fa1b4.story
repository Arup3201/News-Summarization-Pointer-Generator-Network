House prices in Manchester have surged by 21 per cent in a year, the fastest rate anywhere in the country, pushing the average price of a house in the city up to £209,000, Nationwide has reported.

The rise has raised fears of a house price bubble caused the BBC's move north, as people pour in from outside the city and artificially inflate property prices.

The cost of buying a home rose in every region in 2013, with a national average increase of 8.4 per cent now pricing a typical UK home at £175,826.

Chris Bagley, development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses' Manchester and North Cheshire branch, said: 'The BBC must have had an effect on house prices in Manchester. It’s not just what the BBC brings – it’s what it brings with it. Things are looking better and people are encouraged by the growth of major organisations nearby.'

She added: 'I think any kind of conscious move by an organisation that is
seen as prominent, important and a market leader is going to encourage people
to move there.

Ms Bagley went on to say: 'Since the BBC moved north, people suddenly think Manchester is the place to be. And they've brought a lot of people with them.'

A source at the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors suggested the property price rise in Manchester could also be linked to the HS2 project - the planned high speed rail link that aims to cut the journey time between Manchester and London to just over an hour.

He claimed prices may have been driven up as investors inquire about buying second homes in the city ahead of an expected property price hike if the project gets the green light.

Although average nationwide property prices remain around five 
per cent below all-time highs recorded in late 2007, the increase is the
 biggest leap since June 2010, and further evidence of an increasingly 
broad UK property market.

But it was Manchester that emerged as the best-performing area in 2013, with an overall uplift of 1.9 per cent in the North as a whole.

A housing bubble is an economic condition caused by rapid increases in property valuations based on unjustified speculation about how much demand there is to buy.

Once the bubble inevitably bursts, property valuations go into steep decline, leaving those who purchased homes at a higher price out of pocket.

The financial crisis that began in 2007 was partly related to the bursting of numerous housing bubbles around the world.

Banks lost out when people were unable to meet mortgage payments and the value of repossessed properties became considerably less than the money borrowed.

Housing bubbles are considered more dangerous than stock market bubbles as historically they last nearly twice as long and lead to overall losses that are twice as large.

Speaking of the BBC's effect on the 
mood of the area, Ms Bagley said: 'With the BBC on the doorstep there is
 also encouragement to film here, which brings people in. We’ve had some
 big filming projects here lately.'

'In
 many ways it’s down the BBC boost that the FSB will be holding its 
annual conference in Manchester this year. That and the Commonwealth 
Games.'

A BBC spokesperson said: 'The rationale for the move to Salford was to deliver long term and sustainable economic, creative and audience-focused benefits.'

They added: 'We have just celebrated two years of award-winning TV, radio and online content and the whole region is sharing in the momentum of Media City with spend by the Public Service Broadcast channels in the region up from 15.9 per cent to 20 per cent.'

The BBC announced in 2004 that it planned to move several departments north in order to cut costs and increase regional diversity.

However, it has been widely criticised for the £1billion cost of the move, as well as the lavish relocation deals offered to senior staff.

The relocation to MediaCity in Salford was completed in June 2012. There are approximately 2,500 BBC staff 
currently employed at the 200 acre site, which sits on the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal.

Elsewhere, the Nationwide figures show that house prices in London are 14 per cent above their annual peak, with a typical home in the English capital now valued at £345,186.

In 1983, the average home cost 3.5 times the homeowners salary. After a dip in the 90s and and peak in 2007, the average home cost more than five times the owner's annual earnings in 2013

Carlisle
 was named as the worst performer, with a 1 per cent annual increase in 
prices taking the average value of a home there to £136,128.

House prices in Northern Ireland are 
still around half their 2007 levels, although they have climbed by 7 per
 cent year-on-year to reach £111,612 on average.

London has the most expensive house prices in the UK while Northern Ireland has the cheapest, according to Nationwide's figures.

Scotland
 recorded a 3.7 per cent annual increase in house prices, pushing them 
to £136,729 typically, while Wales saw prices pick up by 6.1 per cent 
over the same period, taking the average price there to £139,722.

In England, prices have increased by 8.6 per cent year-on-year to £205,084 typically.

Yesterday,
 Prime Minister David Cameron dismissed fears that the Government is 
pumping up a housing bubble as he hailed the success of its flagship 
Help to Buy scheme.

A new phase of Help to Buy was launched 
in October to offer state-backed mortgages to credit-worthy people 
struggling to get onto the property ladder or move up it because they 
only have a small deposit saved up.

The
 Prime Minister branded sceptics of the mortgage guarantees - such as 
Liberal Democrat business secretary Vince Cable - 'London-centric'.

In many parts of the country prices were 'barely moving at all', he insisted.

More than 6,000 people have put offers
 in on homes and applied for mortgages using Help to Buy since it was 
launched about three months ago.

Nearly
 750 homeowners have completed their purchases and hundreds were able to
 spend Christmas in their new homes, according to the Government.

Robert
 Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said the upturn in prices has 
become 'increasingly broad-based over the course of 2013'.

He said: 'For the second successive quarter, all 13 UK regions saw positive annual house price growth in quarter four.

'Part
 of the reason for the acceleration in house price growth is that the 
supply side of the market has not kept pace with the upturn in demand, 
even though buyer numbers remain subdued by historic standards.

'For example, in quarter three 2013 the number of housing transactions in England was around 25 per cent below pre-crisis levels, while the number of new homes built was around 45 per cent lower.'

Mr Gardner said that current ultra-low interest rates are currently helping to keep home loans relatively affordable, with the typical mortgage payment for a first-time buyer equating to around 29 per cent of their take-home pay.

But he added: 'However, the risk is that if demand continues to run ahead of supply in the quarters ahead, affordability may become stretched.

'House price growth has been outstripping average earnings growth since the start of the year.'
