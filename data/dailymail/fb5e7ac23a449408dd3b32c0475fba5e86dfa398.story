The pilot who died when his helicopter crashed into a crane in central London may have been distracted trying to change the frequency on his radio, an aviation expert said.

Pete Barnes, a veteran pilot with more than 25 years' experience, could have veered off route and missed a turning on the River Thames as he tried to radio Battersea heliport to say he wanted to make an unscheduled landing because of the fog.

Aviation lawyer and qualified pilot James Healy-Pratt told the Daily Telegraph: 'It could have taken 10 to 15 seconds to make the change of radio frequency, in which time the helicopter could have flown up to half a mile.'

Air accident investigators are likely to focus on trying to account for a 'missing minute', during which Mr Barnes was out of contact with flight controllers.

The crane has been severely damaged but Health and Safety Executive officers say it not in danger of collapse and work will begin tomorrow to replace the broken parts

Mr Barnes, 50, from Berkshire, died when the AgustaWestland 109 he was piloting crashed into a crane at the side of The Tower at St George Wharf at 8am on Wednesday, just yards from Vauxhall Station.

His helicopter plunged to the ground 700ft below, killing Matthew Wood, 39, as he walked to work.

Post mortem examinations held at Greenwich Mortuary yesterday have found that Mr Barnes died from multiple injuries and Mr Wood from severe burns and a leg injury.

An inquest will open in due course.

Mr Barnes had been flying from Redhill 
in Surrey to Elstree, Hertfordshire, but he asked to be diverted to 
Battersea heliport because of bad weather.

David Learmount, from aviation 
website Flightglobal, told the Independent that a small change in 
weather conditions, which are thought to have worsened at about the time
of the accident, could have been enough to 'trap' Mr Barnes.

'Weather will turn out to be the key 
issue (in the investigation). When you fly in marginal conditions, it 
only needs a little dip in what you were expecting and you're pretty 
much trapped,' Mr Learmount said.

'He probably did not see the crane 
until it was too late. Sometimes even bright lights are difficult to see
in foggy conditions.'

Today Daily Mail diarist Richard Kay 
revealed how Mr Barnes was on his way to pick up restaurant and clubs 
tycoon Richard Caring when he crashed.

The 62-year-old entrepreneur was 
waiting at Elstree airport in Hertfordshire, unaware that the aircraft 
had diverted to Battersea heliport because of fog.

Last night, Caring said he was devastated by the death of pilot Peter Barnes, whom he described as a ‘very dear friend’.

It emerged yesterday that commuter Matthew Wood was only caught in the disaster because he arrived at work early.

The
dedicated Rentokil manager regularly turned up at his office yards from
the scene of the tragedy before his required start time, his family 
said.

Mr Wood’s younger brother yesterday told how the last contact he had with him minutes before disaster struck was a touching message about his 11 month nephew who was in hospital.

Darren Wood, 35, said he texted his brother shortly before 8am on Wednesday reassuring him that the youngster was doing well. Mr Wood replied with a text saying: ‘Good news.’

His brother said: ‘That was the last I heard from him. At least he was happy.

‘He was a very family oriented guy and he doted on his nephew.'

Forensic teams continue to search the wreckage around the crash site yesterday afternoon

Health and Safety investigators say the crane is not at risk of collapse and work to replace the damaged parts will start tomorrow

Moments after Mr Wood sent the text, the helicopter smashed into the crane and turned into a fireball, sending burning debris plunging the street below near Vauxhall station.

His brother frantically tried to contact Mr Wood again after hearing news of the crash.

He said: ‘I kept texting and saying ‘If you’re alright, text back’ and he didn’t, so I thought something was wrong.

‘I called the office and they said everyone was accounted for and that he might be on the Tube so maybe that’s why he wasn’t answering. We got the bad news at about 3.30pm.’

Mr Wood, from Sutton in South London, was single and did not have any children, but was godfather to several youngsters.

He
planning to hold a party to celebrate his 40th birthday in April. His 
family said the event will now be held as a tribute to him.

His
brother added: ‘You couldn’t have wished to meet a nicer person. He 
loved his family and was always socialising with his friends.’

One
of the workmen who should have been in the crane, but avoided the 
disaster because he slept in, told The Sun how scores of other drivers 
narrowly escaped being killed because of the traffic lights.

Nicki Biagioni has just arrived at the scene of the crash when bits of metal began falling down.

Air accident investigators are set to examine whether warning lights on the top of the crane were working at the time of the crash.The top of St George's Wharf was obscured by mist and fog on Wednesday morning.The Civil Aviation Authority had issued a notice about the newly-erected crane to airmen.This included a note that a warning light was 'lit at night' but it was unclear if it was lit during the day.Crane driver Nicki Biagioni said yesterday the crane was in a safe position with its aviation warning lights working just hours before the accident.The father-of-three from Essex, said that he was the last person at the top of the crane before the accident.He said: ‘It had two lights. Two on the end of the jib. People are talking about whether the light was on or off.‘These things are aviation lights, they cannot be turned on or off.‘One of them is hardwired in with a back-up power supply and the other one is solar powered. So it is not something you can turn on and off. Obviously the bulbs can go, but they were both working.’Mr Biagioni said he and Mr Moule have been best friends since they were toddlers and that he had taught his friend how to drive cranes.

He said: 'When I came running out I saw at least eight or nine cars waiting at the lights, just 20 metres from the wreckage.

'If the lights had turned green seconds earlier they would have moved to a second set of lights under the crane.

'They would have been crushed to death for certain.'

The father-of-three, of Ongar, Essex, said the workmen had often seen helicopters flying past their crane cab but never considered that one would fly into them.

Work to make the scene safe and remove the crane continued today.

A spokesman for Brookfield Multiplex, the building contractor at The Tower, said the crane wreckage will be removed in two stages.

Small loose parts of the crane were 
removed or secured yesterday, and today work to erect a 600-tonne mobile
crane at the site will take place, weather permitting.

Work
on removing and replacing the damaged sections of the crane will start 
tomorrow, and the company hopes to finish the process by the middle of 
next week.

The crane is not 
at risk of collapse and has been examined by the Health and Safety 
Executive and Lambeth Council, the company said.

Cordons and road closures remain in place around the transport hub as work continues to remove the mangled wreckage.

Building contractor Brookfield Multiplex said it hopes to complete the process by the middle of next week, while Transport for London advised drivers to avoid the area throughout the weekend.

Drivers are advised to avoid the Vauxhall Cross and Kennington Park areas today and over the weekend.

Motorists who have to enter the 
congestion charge zone as a result of diversions will not have to pay 
the toll while using signed routes.

Leon Daniels from TfL said: 'Our staff continue to work and minimise disruption to people travelling through the Vauxhall area following the terrible incident and are assisting the emergency services where necessary.

'Due to the ongoing road closures and diversions, traffic in the area has been very busy.

'We are therefore strongly advising road users to avoid the area and use alternative routes throughout Friday and across the weekend.'
