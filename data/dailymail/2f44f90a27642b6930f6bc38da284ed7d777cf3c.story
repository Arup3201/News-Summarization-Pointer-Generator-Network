The dramatic moments leading up to the demise of Julia Gillard as prime minister, as well her emotional turmoil at being stood down, have been revealed in a newly published interview.

Featured in the recently released book, 'Gravity — Inside the Prime Minister's office during her final year and last days', author Mary Delahunty documents the last six months of Gillards time in office at the then Australian leader's own request.

'This has been contentless, it's been all about ego and personalities,' the book records Ms Gillard as saying on the morning she was removed from the role.

'This has been contentless, it's been all about ego and personalities,' she said.

News.com.au reports the book also unveils the political drama surrounding the decisions made by various Labor party members, including frontbencher Jason Clare and Senator Penny Wong, who warned Gillard they could not vote for her in fear of losing their seats.

'Senior Minister Penny Wong came to her in tears. She, too, was abandoning Gillard. Why? "It's the South Australian seats,’" Wong replies,' Ms Delahunty wrote.

'"I knew then that I'd lost it," Gillard said.'

The book also sheds light on the emotional turmoil felt by Gillard even long afterthe leadership scuffle.

'I know, too, that you can feel you are fine but suddenly someone’s words of comfort, or finding a memento in the back of a cupboard as you pack up, or even cracking jokes about old times, can bring forth a pain that hits you like a fist, a pain so strong you can feel it in your nerve endings.

'I know that late at night or at quiet moments of the day feelings of regret, memories that make you shine with pride, a sense of being unfulfilled can overwhelm you,' Gillard said in the interview.

Ms Delahunty's time in Ms Gillard's office was seen as suspicious by others in the Labor office, who feared she was recording information for a sinister purpose.

In a bid to get her own version of the events out, Ms Gillard revealed she will be releasing her own self-written memoir in October which will reflect on her time in politics and her personal experiences which influenced he decision making at the time.
