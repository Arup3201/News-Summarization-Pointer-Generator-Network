For David Moyes, the best, most suitable job in football is about to pass by.

While Moyes considers taking a sabbatical following his dismal spell at Manchester United, Roy Keane is likely to land the manager’s role at Celtic.

That would have been perfect for Moyes, who is still to win a trophy despite 10 fine years in charge at Everton.

Baggage drop: Roy Keane will resurrect his own stalling managerial career in Glasgow

He could hardly fail as Celtic manager in Scotland, and could then return to England with a record of success, minus the millstone of his brief time at Manchester United.

It certainly worked for Martin O’Neill, who did the ‘Double’ twice at Celtic, reached the final of the UEFA Cup — and was installed at Aston Villa in the days when owner Randy Lerner was new and ambitious.

If Moyes’s next job is in the Premier League, he arrives with considerable baggage. He could have dumped that in Glasgow, as Keane will do now.
