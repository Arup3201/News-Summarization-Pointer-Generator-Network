Manchester United have just splashed out £60million on Angel Di Maria, but it is unlikely Sir Alex Ferguson would have sanctioned such a move after the former manager's ‘difficult’ time managing Argentinians.

Ferguson wrote of his troubles handling Juan Sebastian Veron in his autobiography, saying the midfield star didn't make an effort to learn English.

Veron arrived at Old Trafford in 2001 for a then British record transfer fee of £28.1m but struggled to adapt to the English top flight and was moved on to Chelsea after just two years.

High point: There were glimpses of Veron's class at United, such as this goal in the Champions League against Maccabi Haifa in 2002, but overall his time in Manchester was a disappointment

Ferguson wrote: 'I confess I found working with Argentinian footballers quite difficult. There was deep patriotism towards Argentina.

‘They always had the flag round them. I had no problem with that, but the ones I managed didn't try particularly hard to speak English.

‘With Veron it was just, “Mister”.'

Now, United have broken the transfer record again to bring in Di Maria and Louis van Gaal is hoping he performs rather better and Ferguson's words of warning are misguided.

Di Maria is part of an expensive overhaul of the United squad as they aim to recover from a poor start to the season.

He will be the 50th Argentine player to turn out in the Premier League and the fourth at United after Veron, Gabriel Heinze and Carlos Tevez.

Left-back Heinze spent three seasons at United between 2004 and 2007, playing 83 matches and scoring five times.

He grew frustrated with a lack of regular action and demanded a move to Liverpool. United rejected the bid and Heinze eventually joined Real Madrid.

On target: Carlos Tevez scored 34 goals for United in his two seasons with the club

Tevez played for two seasons at Old Trafford, making a total of 99 appearances and scoring 34 goals.

Signed on a two-year loan following a protracted transfer saga with West Ham and his management company, Tevez was never offered a permanent deal and moved to Manchester City in 2009.

The first Argentines in the Premier League arrived around 1998, with Horacio Carbonari at Derby and Mauricio Taricco at Tottenham.

Since then, some like Sergio Aguero at Manchester City and Javier Mascherano at West Ham and Liverpool have played in England with great success.

It remains to be seen whether Di Maria can live up the expectations that come with his expensive price tag.
