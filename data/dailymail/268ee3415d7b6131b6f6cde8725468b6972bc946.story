Holland’s Queen Maxima proved to be a distraction for David Cameron, Barack Obama and Francois Hollande at the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague.

The 40-year-old appeared to court more attention than her husband King Willem-Alexander last night at the Royal Palace Huis ten Bosch.

The monarchs greeted their international guests before the official dinner.

As Britain's Prime Minster David Cameron shook the King's hand he was making eye contact with the blonde-haired queen.

Similarly French President Francois Hollande directed his gaze at the mother-of-three as he greeted her husband.

US President Obama appeared to share a light moment with the Queen as she smiled while he laughed - again her husband looked on.

Later at dinner she continued to capture an audience -  she was seen animatedly pointing to paintings on the ceiling of 
the palace while King Willem Alexander of the Netherlands spoke. 

Queen Maxima seems to be adjusting well to her new role - she became Queen of the Netherlands when her mother-in-law Beatrix abdicated the throne to her son in April, didn't let her basic form of transport get in the way of style.

Maxima was born a commoner in Argentina and is the daughter of a minister who served in the military junta in the late 1970s.

The royal couple have three daughters, Amalia, nine, Alexia, seven, and Ariane, five.

Today President Obama hailed a 'fundamental shift' in international efforts to fight nuclear terrorism as 35 countries  to turn guidelines on nuclear security into national laws.

At the close of a two-day summit, the group also agreed to open up their security procedures to independent review, a further step toward creating an international legal framework to thwart nuclear terrorism.

The move is a joint initiative sponsored by host country the Netherlands, along with past summit hosts the United States and South Korea.

'I believe this is essential to the security of the entire world,' Obama said at a press conference wrapping up the summit.

He added that more still needs to be done: 'Given the catastrophic consequences of even a single attack, we cannot be complacent.'

All 53 countries that participated in the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague agreed Tuesday to keep looking for ways to ensure that nuclear material doesn't fall into the hands of terrorists.

But the pledge to adopt nuclear guidelines into law and undergo external checks was endorsed by just 35 nations, including France, Britain, Canada, Japan, Israel and the three summit hosts. Notably absent from that agreement were Russia, China, India and Pakistan.

North Korea and Iran didn't even attend.

Since Obama launched the summits in 2010, the number of countries that have enough material to build a nuclear weapon has fallen from 39 to 25.
