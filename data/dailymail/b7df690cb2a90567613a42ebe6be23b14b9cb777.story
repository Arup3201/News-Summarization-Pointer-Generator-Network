Colin Noddings, who walked free from court from charges of stalking the son of his ex-wife who he strangled to death

A killer who stalked the son of his ex-wife, who he strangled to death, has walked free from court.

Colin Noddings, 63, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, throttled his former wife Deana Noddings, 46, in 2005 after finding out she had cheated on him as they were rekindling their relationship.

Since his release for manslaughter he started a campaign of harassment against the son of his ex-wife, John Brown-Hunter including one letter that read 'I could find you in two minutes, just like I found your mum'.

He was charged with harassment and stalking, but has now walked free from jail, having been handed a six-month suspended sentence.

A representative of anti-soft justice campaigners Civitas, David Green, said the six month suspended sentence was 'a scandalously feeble response.'

Green said: 'Mr Noddings is a convicted killer and since his early release from prison has threatened the life of the murder victim’s son.

'The suspended sentence might as well have been an absolute discharge.

'As
 so often happens, the judicial system has failed miserably to protect a
 member of the public who lives in constant, realistic fear of death or 
injury.'

Eight years ago, Noddings was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for manslaughter in July 2006 after being cleared of murder by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court.

After a brief re-kindling of their estranged relationship, which was described in court as a 'fatal attraction', his ex-wife was unfaithful.

Noddings claimed his wife’s infidelity had pushed him over the edge, so he throttled her.

Bizarrely, in a letter written around a year before she was strangled, Mrs Noddings foretold her death at the hands of her ex-husband.

The
 letter read: 'Should anything untoward happen to me, I want it in black
 and white...that this would be done by my ex-husband. I know what he is
 like.'

Noddings strangled his wife to death in a jealous rage on November 1, 2005, after uncovering his wife had carried out a seventh affair.

Then, after he killed her, Noddings erected a sign outside of their home in 
in Goldsby, Lincolnshire, that told his neighbours of his partner's infidelity.

Noddings was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court, to a six month suspended sentence for harassing John Brown Hunter, who was set to inherit his ex-wife's estate

Mr Noddings was released from jail in 2009, after serving less than half of his sentence.

Upon his release, he started harassing Mrs Nodding’s son, who was set to inherit Mrs Noddings’ estate, using a series of letters and Facebook messages.

Sara French, prosecuting, told the court, Noddings had started posted messages on his Facebook profile saying, 'Roll on November, when my licence is over, the fun begins' referring to his early release.

Another said: 'Re-post this if you know someone who is alive because you cannot afford a hit man.'

Things escalated in Autumn after Noddings posted a message on his profile saying 'I have friends in Froden Brook', which was identified as the place in Billericay in Essex where Mr Brown-Hunter was living at the time.

Later Noddings sent a message to a friend of Mr Brown-Hunter, saying he was heading to his home town.

The court heard Mr Brown-Hunter was so frightened of his step-dad that he moved his family out of their home and to his in-law’s house.

Noddings has now been found guilty of one charge of stalking Mr Brown-Hunter between March 2013 and December 2013.

The former classic car restorer had been described as having a tumultuous relationship with his former wife.

Noddings met his wife in the 1970s, but their marriage started to break down when Mrs Noddings conducted a number of affairs involving 'bondage sessions'.

The court heard she had the affairs after becoming unhappy with her marriage due to her husband’s controlling nature.

The couple divorced and Mrs Noddings moved to Lincolnshire to avoid continuous harassment ex-husband.

But years later the couple rekindled their relationship, in what Noddings described in court as their 'fatal attraction' that eventually led to her death.

Sentencing 
Noddings for manslaughter in July 2006, Mr Justice Nelson described him 
as 'an obsessive, possessive and besotted man'.

He
 said: 'The previous day you discovered her with her lover, one of 
several she had had through the years of a tempestuous and volatile 
relationship.

'You were suffering from very powerful and mixed emotions.

'It was this provocation which triggered you into doing that which you had contemplated.'
