Caroline Wozniacki took time out from her preparations for the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships to take up sandboarding.

Wozniacki is looking for her first Grand Slam, but certainly showed no signs of feeling the pressure off the court.

The world No 5 posted a video on social media of her boarding down a sand dune and was all smiles in Dubai.

Wozniacki had a high-profile off court relationship with golfer Rory McIlroy before they split in 2014. That now seems long in the past.

Recently, Wozniacki got male deuces flowing by revealing her stunning picture in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit 2015 edition.

The tennis star has shown that again that she is taking her Australian Open defeat to Victoria Azarenka in her stride and took full advantage of her opportunity to have fun on the sand in the Dubai desert.
