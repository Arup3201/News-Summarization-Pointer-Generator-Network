Dripping with chandeliers and lined with gold, this - of course - was Joan Rivers' home.

A dazzling gem of old-school showbusiness, it seems only right that her living room ceilings scaled 30ft-high, and velvet drapes framed the vast windows.

The 5,000-square-foot penthouse is held up by gold pillars.

And in every corner of the opulent New York apartment sit stacks of index cards with jokes spanning her entire career.

Opulent: The drawing room in Joan Rivers's Upper East Side condo is a sea of pink and gold velvet, with a piano in the corner, lit by three glittering chandeliers

The money shot: Stacks of the biting and controversial jokes that made Joan Rivers a star are scattered around the apartment

In progress: Among her extensive archive there were files of uncompleted jokes ready to be worked on

The comedienne, who died last week at the age of 81, once described the Upper East Side condo as 'where Marie Antoinette would have lived if she had the money'.

The limestone mansion was built in 1910 for society figure John R Drexel and his socialite wife.

In 1959, it welcomed Ernest Hemingway as a tenant in one of the one-bedroom apartments. He installed a study and hoped to write but found they city too oppressive and soon left.

Tributes: Bouquets of flowers have been lain across the marble stairs outside the cast iron front door of the Manhattan apartment following Rivers's death

A pillar of showbusiness: Like Rivers, who died last week at 81, the New York apartment lined with pillars and mirrors is a star of the city, valued at around $35million

Renaissance style: Rivers once described her home with marble statues and cast-iron décor as 'where Marie Antoinette would live if she had the money'

Sweeping: To get up to the glittering penthouse, next door to Bette Midler's home, the star would have to scale this vast marble staircase helped by a carved iron rail

Finally, in the 1980s, Rivers descended on the lavish property, called in developers to strip away layers of paint and coat it with gold.

The Renaissance-themed bedroom has a four poster bed draped in white lace, surrounded by vases of white lilies and demure paintings.

But the soft style is vamped up in one of the numerous living spaces, which has leopard-print carpet and deep red chairs. 

And the gregarious performer treated every day like a show as her bathroom looks like the backstage of a theatre. 

Elegant: The bedroom, complete with a four poster bed and lacy drapes and a permanent stock of fresh lilies, is 'as elegant and beautiful as she was', the realtor said

Backstage: She prepared for every day as if she was going to perform, starting in this bulb-lined bathroom which resembled backstage at a theatre

Painstaking: Never one to emerge without a made up face, Joan had an extensive collection of eyeliner, lip liner, eyelash curlers and mascara in little silver pots

Rivers had tried to sell the property a number of times. She first listed it on the market in 2009, when she planned to move to the West Coast to be closer to her daughter, Melissa Rivers. 

The latest attempt was in 2012 went it was listed with an asking price of $29.5 million. 

Now, it may be worth considerably more, with similar-sized apartments in the area on the market for $35 million.

Cosy: This off-shoot of the vast living area is much smaller but still a treasure trove of silver, gold and pink, with a potted orchid and a mahogany table

Fashion police officer: This is a sneak peek inside the decadent wardrobe of the Fashion Police presenter, who revelled in slating other stars' sartorial mishaps

Exquisite: The living room, with a flat screen TV tucked into a book case, boasts a wood fire, framed artworks, and an oriental rug

Gregarious: The comedienne who entertained the world with her risque jokes spent her time in this leopard print room with stacks of books

 In demand: In 2009, Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi allegedly asked to rent the penthouse of the limestone mansion with a cast-iron front door (right)

One notable offer allegedly came from the Libyan dictator Muammur Gaddafi in 2009.

According to Rivers, his advisers got in touch with her broker offering to rent it for $200,000 a week.

She said at the time: 'I thought it was great. I said I would give half the rent to Lockerbie (and the other half) to have an exterminator come and clean the apartment when he was done.'
