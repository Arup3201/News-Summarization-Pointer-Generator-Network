A sign hung from the overpass of a major motorway has sparked outrage over the racist slogan it was splashed with.

The words '"Multiculturalism" is white genocide' were written in thick white lettering on a black banner.

The sign was spotted on the Watland Overpass across the M1 in the Logan suburb of Springwood in Queensland, according to a post on the Logan Memes Facebook page.

First surfacing online on Sunday evening, the offensive banner was slammed by many locals on the Facebook page who branded it 'disgusting' and 'ignorant'.

This racist banner appeared on the Watland Overpass across the M1 in the Logan suburb of Springwood in Queensland at the weekend

One user wrote: 'Sadly some people do think like that its why the world is such a mess'.

Another said: 'People actually think like that???' 

Local man Zach Powson told the Courier Mail he was completely outraged when he saw the image, saying it was difficult to see such offensive behaviour so close to home.

Mr Powson - who grew up in Logan - said: 'Why is this still going on, can’t we learn from history. There needs to be more of an acceptance of the different cultures.'

Logan City Council confirmed to Daily Mail Australia they were aware of the sign and notified the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads (DTMR).

'As soon as we became aware of it we sent people to look for it', DTMR told Daily Mail Australia.

However they also said that as of Tuesday afternoon they could find no trace of the racist banner.
