Thousands of Shiite Muslims took to the streets of Pakistan to protest against the deaths of 61 worshippers, who were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up in the middle of a mosque during Friday prayers.

The sectarian attack - the worst to hit the country in almost two years - took place at a mosque in the Shikarpur district of southern Sindh province, about 300 miles north of Pakistan's biggest city Karachi.

Thousands attended funeral prayers for the dead on Saturday, which had been designated a day of mourning by the provincial government, while others protested against the bombings.

Horror: 61 worshippers were killed when a suicide bomber walked into the middle of a mosque during Friday prayers

Devastating: A police officer said the bomb was loaded with steel pellets, ball bearings and other shrapnel to cause maximum damage

Distraught: A day of mourning was declared by the government in southern Sindh province, closing businesses across the area

Shocking: The attack at the mosque in the Shikarpur district was the most violent in Pakistan since March 2013

Local television broadcast footage of huge crowds of mostly Shiite Muslims, carrying black flags and beating their chests as they offered their prayers, one after another.

Karachi, Pakistan's economic heart and Sindh's provincial capital, also shut down for the day, with hundreds of Shiites staging protest rallies.

Police said unidentified 'miscreants' had set fire to a passenger bus and a truck in the city early in the day, but no one was hurt. 

Police on Saturday said the devastating explosion was a suicide attack, and the bomber detonated the explosives strapped to his body 'in the middle of the mosque'.

'The bomber selected a place in the mosque that would cause huge destruction,' Raja Umar Khitab, a police official in Sindh's counter-terror department, said.

Khitab said the bomb was loaded with steel pellets, ball bearings and other shrapnel to cause maximum damage.

Protests: Thousands attended the funerals, with more people taking to the streets to protest against sectarian attacks like this one

Grief: Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Saturday the whole nation was in mourning after Friday's bombing

Funerals: As people prayed for the dead, Prime Minister Sharif vowed the attack would strengthen the government's resolve to stop terrorism

Rising: There has been an increase in sectarian violence over the past couple of years in Pakistan

Hardline: Most of the violence has been perpetrated by hardline Sunni Muslim groups against the minority Sunnis

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the whole nation was in mourning after the bombing, but vowed that it would strengthen the government's resolve to stop terrorism.

Pakistan 'will win the war against terrorism at any cost', he told a crowd of almost 1,000 counter-terrorism officers in eastern Lahore city.

Pakistan has suffered a rising tide of sectarian violence in recent years, most of it perpetrated by hardline Sunni Muslim groups against minority Shiites, who make up around 20 per cent of the population.

Friday's bombing was the bloodiest single sectarian attack in Pakistan since March 2013, when a car bomb in a Shiite neighbourhood of Karachi killed 45.

A spokesman for the shadowy Jandullah militant group, a splinter faction of the Pakistani Taliban, said they were behind the latest blast.

Injured: Relatives help an injured blast victim at a hospital following Friday's bomb explosion at the mosque

Abandoned: Shoes, left at the entrance by worshippers, were left behind after the blast tore through the mosque

Horrific: Hundreds of people had been attending Friday prayers at the mosque when the suicide bomber detonated his explosives

Prayers: As the community mourned its loss, the Jandullah militant group claimed responsibility for the bombing

Planned: The suicide bomber had apparently chosen his spot in the mosque carefully, so it would have the maximum impact

Anti-Shiite attacks have been increasing in recent years in Karachi and also in the southwestern city of Quetta, the northwestern area of Parachinar and the far northeastern town of Gilgit.

Around 1,000 Shiites have been killed in the past two years in Pakistan, with many of the attacks claimed by the hardline Sunni group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.

Pakistan has stepped up its fight against militants in the past month, following a Taliban massacre at a school in the northwestern city of Peshawar.

Heavily armed gunmen went from room to room at the army-run school gunning down 150 people, most of them children, in an attack that horrified the world.

Since then, the government has ended a six-year moratorium on executions in terror-related cases and pledged to crack down on all militant groups. 

Death toll: About 1,000 Sunnis have been killed in sectarian violence in Pakistan over the last two years

Massacre: The suicide bombing comes just two months after gunmen stormed a school, killing 150 people - mainly children

Death sentence: The Pakistani government has bought in executions in terror-related cases and pledged to crack down on all militant groups
