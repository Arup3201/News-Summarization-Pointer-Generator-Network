Accused: A maths teacher told Michael Piggin, pictured, that he may end up in prison

A maths teacher 'took the Mickey' out of a teenage neo-Nazi by telling him he would 'end up in prison or killing a bunch of people', a court heard.

Michael Piggin was just 16 when he is accused of drawing up plans for a massacre at his former school in Loughborough, Leicestershire, inside a swastika-adorned Che Guevara notebook.

But in police interviews aired at the Old Bailey - where Piggin is charged with plotting terrorism - the English Defence League supporter said the notebook was simply an outlet for his anger.

He added he had been angry when the teacher challenged him on his extreme views.

Speaking to police, he said: '[The maths teacher] would say I am probably going to end up in prison or killing a bunch of people.

‘You wouldn’t expect a teacher to take the Mickey out of someone in front of the class.

‘It did annoy me.’

He had named his maths teacher on a so-called ‘hitlist’ and wrote about shooting him dead.

But Piggin told police: ‘I wouldn’t say I actually wanted to kill him.

‘I might have at the time I wrote it.’

He added: ‘If I did want to hurt him, I wouldn’t have written about it, I would have just done it.

‘I’m not that kind of person, that’s why I wrote it.’

Piggin idolised English Defence League
 founder Tommy Robinson and mass murderers, including the Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik, the trial has heard.

Accused of drawing up a hitlist of former pupils and classmates he wanted to kill, Piggin kept a Swastika flag above his bed 
next to a poster of Heath Ledger as The Joker.

Air rifles and 
half-made petrol bombs were found on the floor in his bedroom next to books about notorious 
killings.

Bedroom: The jury was shown a photograph of Piggin's room at his home in Loughborough with a Nazi flag

Notebook: The Che Guevara journal which belonged to Piggin. He said it was an outlet for his frustration

Preparation: The jury was previously shown footage of Michael Piggin, now 18, 'testing' a Molotov cocktail against a wall behind a leisure centre while his friends filmed him on a mobile phone

Flames: The Old Bailey saw him launch the homemade explosive, which was put together using a wine bottle

But Piggin, now 18, told police the plans in his notebook would never have been carried out.

‘I can control myself 99.9 per cent of the time’, he told the officer.

‘I was writing it in the notebook so I wouldn’t end up hurting anyone by carrying out acts of violence against them.

‘I think I see it as me being able to control the situation by writing.’

Piggin added later: ‘I wasn’t going to go that far - it was just writing.

‘It was never enough generally, that’s why I wrote it, to clear the anger.’

Organisation: The accused teenager is said to have plotted a Columbine-style massacre in Loughborough

Graffiti: More footage showed the defendant allegedly spraying 'No more mosques' on the wall

In his notebook, which was also adorned with Nazi slogans, Piggin drew up a detailed plan for the alleged assault.

He wrote ‘Take down anyone I see, hold out in a classroom and possible take hostages and fight the police until the end.’

Piggin
 is accused of plotting terrorist attacks on his college, a mosque, 
cinema, Loughborough University and council offices, while stock-piling 
knives, homemade explosives, and crossbow in his bedroom.

The
 court has heard Piggin isolated himself at school and college with a 
string of racist comments and violent outbursts against fellow pupils. 

He openly declared support for the EDL, the IRA, and said he supported Adolf Hitler, it is alleged.

Target: Piggin allegedly wanted to hit Loughborough University, pictured, among other sites

In online chats, it is alleged Piggin said he wanted to buy a gun to carry out his ‘operation’.

Piggin said he was angry with the teacher for not helping him to get better grades, and believed he was an ‘idiot’.

He and two other 18-year-old boys, who cannot be named, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs.

Piggin
 denies two charges: possessing articles for a purpose connected with 
terrorism, and possession of a document or a record containing 
information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or 
preparing an act of terrorism on or before 19 February 2013.

The trial continues.
