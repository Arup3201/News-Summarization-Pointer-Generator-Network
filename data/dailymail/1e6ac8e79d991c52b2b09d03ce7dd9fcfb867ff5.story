An outspoken Chinese-American investor and social media celebrity has been arrested on suspicion of visiting a prostitute following a crackdown on bloggers who have posted sensitive material on China's heavily restricted Internet.

Charles Xue, who has more than 12 million
followers on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo, was detained on Friday 
evening in a Beijing neighborhood along with a 22-year-old woman, according to 
police and state media on Sunday.

The naturalized American citizen, 60, 
regularly reposts reform-minded content and frequently comments on other 
issues including China's air quality and food safety.

Questioned: Chinese-American investor and social media celebrity Charles Xue has been arrested on suspicion of visiting a prostitute

Last week government-run newspaper The People's Daily reminded China's 'big Vs' - popular bloggers whose social media profiles are verified as genuine - that they 'should be careful what information they convey ... and use their right to expression responsibly.'

Many Chinese celebrities, from pop stars to business tycoons, have amassed huge followings on social media sites, and at times have posted material that the government has not approved of, such as calling attention to social injustices and questioning state policies.

This month, internet censors called popular microbloggers to meetings and asked them to agree to standards, including keeping social order - a move observers have said has a chilling effect on public discourse.

State media have also accused some microbloggers of undermining socialism and promoting Western values through lies and negative news.

Xue's celebrity name, Xue Manzi, shot to the top of the most-searched for terms after the venture capitalist's arrest was announced.

Among those questioning the motive behind the arrest was the editor of the state-run Global Times newspaper.

'Cannot rule out the possibility that authorities are arresting Xue Manzi with a prostitute to give him a hard time,' Hu Xijin wrote Sunday in a blog posting that later disappeared.

Referring to Xue, Beijing police announced on their own microblog on Sunday that a 60-year-old man with the surname Xue had been detained Friday and confessed to visiting a prostitute.

It said he had been arrested in a Beijing neighborhood along with a 22-year-old woman who had admitted to prostitution.

Xue's arrest follows a similar string of detentions in recent days of others who have triggered scandals online.

On Friday, police questioned Liu Hu, an investigative reporter of the Guangzhou-based New Express, who had alleged on his microblog that a senior government official was negligent with his public duties.

Liu was arrested on suspicion of fabricating and spreading rumors and the case is being investigated, according to the Beijing police's microblog.

Among others questioned was blogger Zhou Lubao, who many have dubbed 'watch brother' after he initiated a campaign against an official who wore expensive watches that he wouldn't have been able to afford on his salary. 

The Chinese Ministry of Public Security said that Zhou had been arrested on suspicion of extortion.

Blogger and former journalist Zhu Ruifeng said that the arrests were a response to the huge influence some commentators were gaining online, and the fact that more and more people were denouncing officials via social media.

Mr Zhu himself triggered a scandal last year when he released an online video of one official having sex with a woman hired by property developers in an alleged extortion scheme.

Mr Zhu said that Xue's name was all over state media and that the government had intended to damage his reputation,as well as showing that the authorities were serious about controlling online opinion-formers.
