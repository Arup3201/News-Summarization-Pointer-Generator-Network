It's not known for its budget-friendly accommodation - but prices for a night in the capital city are now the highest in Europe. 

As hotel rates in the UK soared by an average of nine per cent last year the average price for a room in London shot up to £126.

Prices in London soared by 16.1 per cent taking it above Zurich in Switzerland and the only  place in the UK to average at over £100.

The average price for a night in London is £100, making it the most expensive European city to stay in

The study, by online hotel reservations service HRS, showed that Leeds, which hosted the 2014 Tour de France, saw the biggest increase in hotel prices, up 21.6 per cent year on year.

Edinburgh was the second most expensive city at an average of £99 per night, followed by Bristol at £87. The cheapest average room rates in the UK were in Birmingham and Liverpool, both £74.

Jon West, managing director at HRS, said: 'These figures show that UK hoteliers are clearly reaping the rewards from an uplift in demand from both leisure and business travellers.

'This is great news for hoteliers who are able to charge more on average for their rooms per night, but obviously not so great for guests paying a premium.' 

Prices in the capital, known for its five-star accommodation such as the Savoy and Claridges, have shot up 

New York - £157

Washington - £130

Rio de Janeiro - £128

London - £126 per night

Edinburgh - £99 per night

Bristol -  £87 per night

It is thought that the global economic recovery, and increasing affluence in the Far East, saw more leisure and business travellers coming to the UK and London in particular.

HRS explained that average rates had fluctuated 'significantly' in cities across Europe and worldwide. London beat Zurich into second place in the European rankings, with average rates in the Swiss city at £110 a night, whlie Paris came in third at £106.

New York continues to be the world's most  expensive city to stay in, with an average room rate of £157 per night, while Washington came in second at £130 and Rio de Janeiro third at £128.

Back in June 2014 London overtook Sydney, Paris, New York, Stockholm, Zurich and Oslo to claim the title of most expensive city break destination in the world.

The capital was found to be the most expensive city in Europe for cultural activities, even more costly than Paris for tickets to such attractions as ballet and opera.

Research from Post Office Travel Money revealed that even with some museums and art galleries being admission-free in London, overall the city still surpassed 11 of the continent's other major cities.
