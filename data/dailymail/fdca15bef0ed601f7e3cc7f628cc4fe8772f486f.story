A father branded 'Dad of the Year' after donning a pair of Daisy Dukes in protest to his teenage daughter wearing short shorts has began writing a parenting book and public speaking.

In September, Scott Mackintosh, from Lehi, Utah became an internet hit after his 19-year-old daughter Myley shared an image of him wearing the tiny shorts online.

Within days, the photos were seen across the country and he appeared on morning television, news segments and comedy shows which poked fun at his eyebrow-raising wardrobe choice and commended his original way of teaching his daughter a lesson in modesty.

Getting his point across: In September, Scott Mackintosh's daughter 
wouldn't change out of her short shorts before a family outing, so the dad slipped into a pair of his own. He is now writing a parenting book

'Initially it was the funny picture that
took off,' his wife Becky told the Deseret News. 'But then when they read the story, it was a lesson of love. He did that because he loves his child. He brought embarrassment to himself, not to his 
daughter.'

Since their story spread, they have received messages of support from teenagers and their parents.

Becky added: 'The ones who touched us the most came from 
teens and a few adults referring back to when they were teens, saying," I wish I had a dad that loved me that much".'

The couple has now been inspired to pursue their dreams of writing a book and public speaking.

After their story became national news, New York Times best-selling author Bridget Cook contacted the family and is helping them write a book: 'My Husband Wears the Short Shorts in THIS Family.'

Public speaker Chad Hymas has also worked with the couple to help them prepare for sharing their advice; photographs on their Facebook pages reveal they have already spoken with students.

'We don't claim to be experts, just sharing our own experiences as parents,' Becky said. 'We have a sense of humor, but we are also very serious. Yet you have to laugh and roll with things when you are a parent. It can be overwhelming.'

They are also about to launch a website, Life's Short Lessons.

The family's fame came after they were preparing to go on a night out and Myley opted to wear some tiny shorts. When she refused to change, her father took some scissors to his own jeans.

The result was a
revealing pair of cut-offs designed to show his daughter her shorts 
aren't 'as cute as she thinks'.

'I know it sounds weird to try to 
embarrass her but I wanted her to know that she's of great worth,' Mr 
Mackintosh, from Utah, told Good Morning America.

At first, the children had their heads buried in their phones, Mackintosh said, and didn’t notice his revealing attire.

'Why are you dressed like that?' his daughter eventually asked when they were nearly at the restaurant. 'Oh well, I don't care.'

Dinner
came and went without Mackintosh’s daughter breaking a sweat, so he 
decided to take things to the next level and suggesting going miniature 
golfing. Again, Myley claimed she was not bothered.

But when they arrived at a local ice cream shop, she cracked.

'As I pulled into a stall, my daughter said, “Uh, no! We are not going in!” I said “Let's go through the drive up".'

Mackintosh, his wife, and their son went inside, but their daughter stayed in the car.

'It got a point across,' his daughter
said in an interview after the story came out. 'Mostly I just learned the lesson of how much he loves 
me and that he really cares about it.'
