Lionel Messi has agreed a new contract at Barcelona with the Argentina superstar set to become the world's highest-paid player on £16.3million a year.

The player’s father Jorge met club officials Javier Faus and Antoni Rossich last week and closed what is the seventh new deal in 11 years for the four-time Ballon d’Or winner.

Messi will be 27 in June and the new deal is not expected to extend his existing contract length taking him to 2018.

He's staying: Lionel Messi has agreed to sign a new deal keeping him at Barcelona

Boost: Messi agreeing a new deal is the news the Barcelona fans had been waiting for

But his 
earnings have been boosted to put him ahead of Real Madrid’s Cristiano 
Ronaldo, who earns £15m before bonuses.

Wayne Rooney, the highest-paid player in England, is on £15.6m a year (£300,000 a week).

Messi’s
 previous deals have been structured so that basic pay before bonuses is
 re-set each year of the deal according to bonuses earned the previous 
season.

In
 effect Messi will earn £16.3m next season but if he wins the Champions 
League the appropriate bonus will be added and the sum total will become
 his new basic pay level the following season.

Messi’s
 £250m buy-out clause will remain the same leaving the door open for 
Manchester City or Paris Saint-Germain to make a bid, though the rigours
 of Financial Fair Play surely rule out such a move for either club.

Warming up: Messi and his Barcelona team-mates trained on Friday ahead of Saturday's crunch clash

A
 statement issued by the Catalans on Friday read: 'FC Barcelona has 
reached an agreement to adjust the terms in the contract binding Leo 
Messi to the club as a professional first team player. The revised and 
updated contract will be signed over the next few days.'

Barca
 had wanted a grand unveiling of Messi’s new deal but time ran out on 
them as preparations for Saturday’s La Liga decider against Atletico 
Madrid took over.

The
 player is understood to have put back his return to Argentina ahead of 
World Cup preparations so he can sign the new deal at the start of next 
week.  

Most
 crucially from the club’s point of view, Messi’s new deal means Barca 
will now be better placed to tap in to the huge stream of commercial 
revenue he generates as for the first time since signing his initial 
deal in 2005 the player will not keep 100 per cent of his image rights - they 
will now be shared with the club.

Jorge
 Messi finally agreed to the revision in last week’s crunch meeting. In 
that meeting he was also told that the club’s new manager for next 
season will be Luis Enrique.

New
 signings were not discussed although it is no secret that the Barca 
forward is close pals with Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero and 
would love him to join him at the Nou Camp.

A bid for Aguero would only be possible if Barcelona successfully off-loaded forwards Alexis Sanchez and Pedro.

The
 club are also keen to move on Alex Song and Javier Mascherano as they 
look to beat Bayern Munich to the signing of Chelsea’s Brazil defender David Luiz.
