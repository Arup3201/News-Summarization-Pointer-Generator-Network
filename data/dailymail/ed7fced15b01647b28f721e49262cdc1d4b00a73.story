Useful as a mixer: Coca-Cola is the world’s best-known brand. In 2012, more than 1.8 billion people in more than 200 countries drank a Coke every day

Coca-Cola is the world’s best-known brand. In 2012, more than 1.8 billion people in more than 200 countries drank a Coke every day — that’s about one can or bottle for every four human beings on the planet.

To create all the world’s Coke takes 79 billion gallons of water every year, added to a secret syrup of sugar (or high-fructose corn syrup), caffeine, coca leaf extract and flavourings. And an estimated eight thousand billion gallons of water is used to make the bottles and cans each year.

When chemist John Stith Pemberton, from the U.S. state of Georgia, created the original Coca-Cola formula in 1886 in a pharmacy in the state capital Atlanta, he labelled it a ‘brain tonic’. The first advertisements promised that it ‘Cures Morphine and Opium Habits and Desire for Intoxicants’.

Pemberton’s inspiration was a popular concoction called Vin Mariani, created by Angelo Mariani, a chemist from Corsica in 1863. It consisted of Bordeaux red wine infused with a sizeable pinch of cocaine, which was legal in most countries in the 19th century, and was said to give a galvanic energy boost.

The anti-alcohol Temperance movement in the Deep South of the U.S. was opposed to Vin Mariani. Pemberton’s version was alcohol-free, a soft soda drink made from sugar syrup spiced with citric acid, nutmeg, vanilla, Chinese cinnamon oil and the two ingredients which gave Coca-Cola its name – kola nut powder to deliver a caffeine kick, and coca leaf extract which contained trace quantities of cocaine.

The first Coca-Cola outlet was Joe Jacob’s pharmacy in Atlanta. Pemberton sold his undiluted syrup to Jacobs, and customers had their drinks mixed and served at the soda fountain on the first floor, at five cents a glass — sitting at the marble-topped counter, in a magnificent bar with floor-to-ceiling windows.

All Pemberton’s quack cures and fruit remedies couldn’t cure his drug addiction. He died in 1888, shortly after selling the formula for Coca-Cola and all his shares in the business to another Atlanta pharmacist, a workaholic Methodist named Asa Candler.

The first Coke bottles were all shapes and colours: clear, green, brown, straight-sided, squat and all other sorts. The classic design, known as the ‘hobbleskirt’, that became the brand’s signature did not appear until 1916.

Candler’s success didn’t go unnoticed. North Carolina businessman Caleb Bradham launched a copycat product in 1893, without the coca leaf extract. He called it Brad’s Drink. Five years later, looking for a name to convey its fizzy appeal, he rebranded it . . . as Pepsi-Cola.

By 1903, concerned at news reports of growing drug abuse in southern U.S. states, the puritanical Candler had decided to remove all traces of cocaine from Coke. His new formula contained ‘de-cocainised’ coca leaves and kola nut powder. It was known by the secret name, Merchandise#5.

Anti-drug campaigners attacked America’s growing dependence on caffeine, and called for a national ban on caffeinated beverages. One Texan politician declared in 1909: ‘The reason they put this dope in Coca-Cola is to create a constant craving for more and thus sell the drink.’

Caffeine prices shot up due to shortages in World War I, and in 1918 Coca-Cola halved the quotient to today’s levels – a can contains about half the caffeine of a shot of espresso.

The first glass of soda-fountain Coke in 1886 cost five cents — about 80p today. By 1950, the cost of a bottle was about the same. A can of Coke in a supermarket is now about 70p.

In 1943, Coca-Cola got the order that turned it into a global brand. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the future U.S. president, dismissed fears over the wartime sugar shortage and placed a contract for six million bottles of Coke each month for the troops.

The fast food chain McDonald’s is Coca-Cola’s biggest customer. Their franchise outlets don’t sell ready-mixed Coke in bottles or cans — they purchase the syrup and dilute it with soda dispensers, just as it was first sold in the 1880s.

Consumers started to demand decaffeinated drinks, especially coffee, in the Eighties. But that had a surprise bonus for Coca-Cola: the price of caffeine fell as demand plummeted, and the company was able to develop ‘high-energy’ drinks packed with the stimulant . . . which proved popular with students and all-night ravers.

After Prohibition in the early Thirties, when breweries were struggling to keep up with demand for beer, the first steel cans were developed. But the acid in fizzy pop started to eat through the metal within weeks. Now the cans have a protective polymer lining.

The first Coke cans were manufactured in 1955, for export to military bases. Demand soared, and the company discovered huge savings in recycling costs: tins could be thrown away, but bottles had to be collected and returned to the depot, which meant paying for transport.

The ring-pull can was a disaster for bottle-makers. In 1929, there were 1,200 bottle plants in the U.S. but by 1997 there were just 100 left. It was a disaster for beauty spots and beaches too, as consumers simply threw away their cans. ‘Keeping America clean and beautiful is your job,’ one TV advert scolded.

Coke chairman J. Paul Austin loathed litter, and became one of the first corporate eco-campaigners. In 1970, he warned, ‘Unless all of us begin immediately to reverse the processes of impending self-destruction, which we have set in motion, this green land of ours will become a graveyard.’

To encourage people to pick up litter, Coca-Cola launched the ‘Bend A Little’ campaign. Posters featured a young woman bending over to clear up cans and rubbish. Another billboard featured a Coke bottle with the slogan, ‘If you love me, don’t leave me.’

The trend towards fast food helped soft drink consumption to boom. In 1955, the average American drank 11 gallons of fizz every year. By 2005, that had more than tripled, to 36 gallons . . . and every gallon contains about a pound of high-calorie sweetener.

That sweetener was not sugar. In fact, it was an artificial by-product from maize or sweetcorn, grown in the Midwest with U.S. government subsidies and turned into a brown syrupy gel that was sweeter than sucrose. It was called high-fructose corn syrup 55, because it contained 55 per cent fructose and 45 per cent glucose (table sugar is 50/50).

The company’s adverts have always celebrated the drink’s popularity. In 1917, billboards boasted how many bottles were drunk: ‘Three Million A Day’. By 1925, it had doubled to ‘Six Million A Day’ — a mere third of a single percent of today’s demand. But the most famous was never an official slogan — the pop song, I’d Like To Buy The World A Coke, was from a 1971 television ad.

Whether you drink it with clinking ice or lace it with rum, the chances are you've had a glass of Coca-Cola. But love it or loathe it, how much do you know about the drink that has dominated the world for 150 years?
