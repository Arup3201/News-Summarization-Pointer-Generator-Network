CCTV images show a callous killer putting out his wheelie bin for collection - with his next-door neighbour’s body stuffed inside.

James Jepson, 25, strangled Steven Rourke with a washing line after taking exception to the victim - who has special needs - trying to give him a hug.

Afterwards he dumped the body headfirst into his black wheelie bin along with his household waste before going off drinking and socialising with friends.

A CCTV picture shows killer James Jepson putting out the wheelie bin containing Steven Rourke's body out for collection shortly before 7am two days after the murder

Around four hours later the murderer appears to have changed his mind and moves the wheelie bin to behind his house - with nobody else aware of what was inside

Two days later a camera captures him calmly putting the bin out in front of his home, as if for collection, shortly before 7am.

But hours later he appears to change his mind and moves the bin away from the public eye to his back garden.

It was later discovered dumped on a disused railway line near a copse by two boys who looked inside.

They moved carpet underlay to reveal the sole of a foot, and found Steven’s petrol-soaked body.

Jepson from Hindley, near Wigan, Greater Manchester, was jailed for a minimum of 18 years after being convicted of murder at Liverpool Crown Court.

The court was told Steven, who had learning difficulties, had to be heavily supported in the community by carers and support workers who paid daily visits to his home.

Although described by neighbours as ‘polite and harmless’ he would sometimes make inappropriate remarks to complete strangers and try and cuddle them.

The killing occurred on March 22 after Jepson who lived next door to Steven had been snorting cocaine.

It is believed he bumped into the victim outside his back door.

Steven asked for a cigarette but the pair had a huge row after Jepson claimed the victim ‘come onto him.’

Jepson strangled Steven with the blue length of washing line before hiding the corpse in a wheelie bin and heading off to a party.

He was later seen pulling the bin around the area before it was abandoned.

Over that weekend, a number of people passed the bin and even looked inside to investigate, but because of the carpet underlay no concerns were raised.

Tests showed Steven was throttled with a blue washing line which was tightly wrapped round his neck four times and had a double knot at the front.

Jepson’s girlfriend Rauridh Earley, a 20-year old barmaid, told the jury how her boyfriend would have rages because of the death of his father in 2011.

The week before the killing she discovered she was pregnant and although Jepson wanted her to keep it he agreed with her that she was too young and on March 22 - the day of the murder - she began taking medication to terminate the pregnancy.

After the killing Miss Earley met up with Jepson when he burst into tears and admitted: ‘I think I have killed somebody. I have done something stupid, I have killed somebody.’

She told him to give himself up to police but before they parted he asked for a kiss and a cuddle. She broke down in tears as she said: ‘I knew it would be the last time I would see him so I couldn’t do it.’

Jepson later claimed he ‘blacked’ out when Steven tried to hug him and woke up to find the victim lying on the floor.

But in a statement the victim’s mother Christine Rourke said: ‘I feel like my son’s dignity was taken away after being put out in the bin like rubbish.

‘He was loving and caring person who was vulnerable and tormented by mental health issues which makes it harder to understand how someone could harm and kill such a gentle young man.’

‘He was always happy to help others. He was well known in the area, where he was well liked as Steven never saw any bad in anyone. At 26 years-old Steven was taken from us far too young.’

Judge Clement Goldstone QC told Jepson: ‘You utterly disrespected Steven’s body by putting it in the wheelie bin as if, as his mother said, putting out rubbish and you then covered it with carpet cut-offs.

‘Your conduct was a gross over-reaction not least because you knew enough of Steven Rourke’s character to know that although he may have been a nuisance he was basically harmless.’
