Killed: Ashton Jojo, 11, was fatally electrocuted when she tried to retrieve her golf ball from a Florida resort's pond in June

The family of an 11-year-old girl who died after being electrocuted while playing miniature golf at a Florida resort is seeking more than $27 million in damages.

Ashton Jojo of Latham, N.Y. let out a scream after reaching into a small, two-foot-deep concrete pond at the Orange Lake Resort near Orlando to retrieve her golf ball on June 27.

On Tuesday her family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the resort seeking damages for the emotional distress suffered by parents David and Deborah Jojo and their 14-year-old son Donovan.

Resort spokeswoman Stacey Sutherland told the Orlando Sentinel that company policy prohibits commenting on pending litigation.

She said 'our hearts go out to the Jojo family during this difficult time.'

The family's Miami-based attorney Ira Leesfield says the resort didn't hire a certified electrical contractor or obtain proper permits to replace aging equipment.

Another person staying at the Orange Lake Resort rushed to help Ashton but was also injured in their attempt to save the girl who later died at hospital.

Deputies from Orange County Sheriff's Office were called to the Kissimmee resort shortly after 2pm.

Inspection officers found possible code violations of the water feature.

Electrical breakers were improperly placed.

A statement released by the sheriff's office said: 'During her game [of miniature golf], the victim's golf ball fell into a small pond that is located inside the golf area.

'When the victim attempted to retrieve her ball from the pond, she screamed as if she was in distress.

'Another guest, Christopher Burges, who was also in the golf area, heard the screaming and attempted to rescue her.

'Mr Burges was unable to rescue the child as he suffered an injury as well.'

Police named the girl and said she had died after being taken to Celebration Hospital.

Resort guests told WESH 2 News that hotel
workers had informed them the girl had been electrocuted and the sheriff's office confirmed that was one of the possible causes being investigated.
