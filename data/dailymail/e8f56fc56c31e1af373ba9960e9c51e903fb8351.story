A school bus attendant is accused of breaking a five-year-old autistic boy's arm as he tried to discipline him.

Richard Mason, 39, was chaperoning a bus-load of elementary school children in Commack, New York, when he allegedly grabbed Connor Shirangi’s arm and twisted it behind his back, causing the bone to fracture.

The trained childminder claimed he was forced into action after the boy began banging the window with his fist.

'[He was] pounding his hand against 
the window and to prevent the window from shattering, I blocked him,' 
Mason told Suffolk County police.

But
Connor's mother, Desiree Johnston-Shirangi, has a different story, 
claiming the trained childminder used unnecessary force.

Sheis 
considering suing employers Acme Bus Co for damages.

She
told CBS2: 'Connor was swinging his feet and kicking the seat of the 
bus and Mr Mason apparently got upset and handled him the way you 
wouldn’t handle anybody.

'From
what the doctors are saying, he used excessive force on my child. My 
son was going through this, and the fear that he had, to the point that he
urinated in his pants and I wasn’t there.'

She
added: 'Excessive force was used and my child was severely injured. 
Aside from the broken arm he has bruising about the waist consistent 
with being tied down.'

Mason pleaded not guilty yesterday to charges of third-degree assault and acting in a manner to injure a child. He was released on bail until a later date.

Friends of Mason leapt to his defence yesterday, describing him as 'very gentle, he’s kind, he loves kids'.

One mother, whose child also travels on the same bus, wrote on a message board: 'I happen to know richard very well...my 5 year old non verbal child with autism was on that bus.

'Richard has been good to us and Maxx loved him! There were 2 brothers fighting on the bus and he was trying to break it up.

'My heart goes out to the parents as i can imagine how they feel, however I am waiting to hear more details of the investigation before i form an opinion.'
