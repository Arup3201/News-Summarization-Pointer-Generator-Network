If Stan Wawrinka really is, as his team-mate’s wife hollered last Saturday, a ‘cry baby’, then he is in for quite some ordeal.

In Lille's football stadium he takes on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the first match of the most anticipated Davis Cup final for years. In front of 27,000 fans, mostly against him, he will try to give Switzerland its first ever win.

His deadly rival from the O2 Arena, Roger Federer, will be his brother-in-arms, but it is expected that his chief provocateur from that emotional night at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals will be absent.

Event officials were told on Thursday that Federer’s wife Mirka is not planning on making an appearance. Not that she would be trying to put off Wawrinka on this occasion, not when her husband’s hopes of further cementing his legacy depend so much on his compatriot.

Wawrinka and Federer were again presenting a united front, putting aside the fractious events in London in finding a common purpose against a better prepared French team. Federer practised twice yesterday on the indoor clay court laid beneath the closed roof of the impressive Stade Pierre Mauroy, which will be one of the venues for football’s 2016 European Championship.

After his first outing the world No 2 declared himself fit, despite pulling out of the London final with a back injury, while Wawrinka spoke of the positive atmosphere in the ranks of the Swiss team.

Helpfully, they have also found a common enemy for last Saturday’s fracas at the O2 in umpire Cedric Mourier, whom they have both condemned for spilling the haricots in an interview by confirming what happened.

Certainly Mirka was not getting a mention. The odd commentator this week felt her conduct last Saturday was a commendable sign of being a strong woman. Others might just regard it as poor behaviour. Regardless, for Wawrinka this final offers a chance to top off a breakthrough year that he began by beating Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal back to back to win the Australian Open.

He will probably need to gain at least one singles point to help Federer win the Davis Cup trophy in what may well be his last chance to do so.

In the eternal debate about who is the greatest ever, the appearance of the Davis Cup on Federer’s c.v. would add weight to his claims. His closest modern rivals (Djokovic and Nadal) have long since ticked it off their bucket list.

Federer declined to comment on whether he had undergone an injection in his troublesome back and was cautious about his prospects.

‘It’s been a difficult week, but I’m happy with where I am today. We will see, only the match gives all the answers. I will give it a go,’ he said, admitting this was an important weekend for him. ‘It’s a big deal, no doubt about it.’

If he is physically restricted then the telescopically limbed Gael Monfils is not the person he would want to meet on a clay court over the best of five sets.

The Frenchman has extraordinary retrieving ability and keeps opponents running, although his mercurial temperament will be tested by the expectation of the massive crowd.

Last weekend’s spat between the two Swiss men may not have much material effect, especially as Wawrinka is a genial soul whose relations with Federer have, broadly, been good over the years. And in any walk of life one person can get on well with another while not being mad about their friend’s partner.

Wawrinka said that coming to Lille and changing scene had been a help after describing himself as detruit — destroyed — by the defeat on Saturday night.

‘Sure it was tough losing to Roger with four match points,’ he admitted. ‘It was a tough loss, but I played well in London, I’m feeling great from that. When I came here it was a new week, a new state of mind. It was easier than I thought.’

Given a clean bill of health and no underlying issues, Switzerland would start this final as favourites, partly due to the unpredictable nature of the two French singles players.

Monfils and Tsonga are abundantly talented, but you are never quite sure what you will get. And if anything they are undercooked, having not played for three weeks, while the opposite may be true for the Swiss.

The two sets of players greeted each other warmly at yesterday’s draw but then they do have something in common: they all live in Switzerland, funnily enough, away from the clutches of the French taxman.
