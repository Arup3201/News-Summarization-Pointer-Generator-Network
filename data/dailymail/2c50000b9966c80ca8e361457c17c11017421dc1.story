The nephew of the former owner of the San Diego Padres baseball team has died after the exclusive sports car he was driving rammed into an SUV on Christmas Eve.

Barry Alexander Moores was driving a rare Ariel Atom sports car, which has top speeds of more than 150 mph, when he lost control of the vehicle on a curve.

The 21-year-old, the nephew of multi-millionaire John Moores, then collided head-on with a Ford Expedition in Rancho Santa Fe, California, according to the Union-Tribune.

Moores and another passenger, also 21, were both wearing helmets at the time of the crash Wednesday afternoon, the California Highway Patrol said.

Moores was declared brain dead and kept on life support until his organs were donated on Saturday. 

The passenger was flown to a hospital in Escondido with major injuries. No update on his condition was available.

The driver and passenger in the SUV were taken to a local hospital with minor to moderate injuries, CHP officer Chris Parent said.

Moores is the nephew of philanthropist and developer John Moores, who previously owned the San Diego Padres. 

He sold the team in 2012 for $800million, reportedly pocketing around $200million from a Major League TV deal. 

In 2003, Forbes estimated his wealth to be $740million, but it is believed to have grown ever since.  

According to a career profile, Barry Moores had recently graduated from UC Berekely and was working as a summer analyst for Oaktree Capital Management.  

The Moores family declined to comment when reached by telephone Saturday. 

The car he was driving can be built from scratch by buying the various parts. The cost of full models ranges from $30,000 to $300,000. 

Following the head-on collision with an SUV on Christmas Eve he was taken to hospital and declared brain dead. His organs were then donated on Saturday

According to authorities, the two passengers in the other vehicle suffered minor injuries

Moores sold the San Diego Padres for $800million in 2012. He reportedly pocketed $200million stemming from a Major League TV deal

The car involved in the crash can be built by buying the separate parts. Prices for the custom-built vehicle range between $30,000 and $300,000
