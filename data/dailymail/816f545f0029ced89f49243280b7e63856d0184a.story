Two drunk men who broke into a police van to fool around were arrested - when they got locked inside.

Real-life 'Dumb and Dumber' Jeffrey Olson, 22, and Ryan Letchford, 21,  had been at a party on Friday night when they spotted the empty patrol vehicle.

The pair decided to climb inside and began to play with the equipment and take pictures of each other pretending to be arrested.

Dumb and Dumber: Jeffrey Olson, 22, and Ryan Letchford, 21, were arrested after breaking into a police van, the authorities said

But disaster struck for the pair when they really did end up in handcuffs when they became locked inside.

Police arrived at the vehicle in South Jersey, Philadelphia, in the early hours of the morning and arrested the criminals.

The two men were charged with attempted theft of a motor vehicle, public drunkenness and criminal mischief, police said.

'It was un-freaking-believable,' Constable Mike Connor, whose van the men are said to have burgled, told the Philadelphia Inquirer.

The pair hatched the bizarre plan after getting drunk at a nearby party at a condominium in Radnor.

It is understood that a door of the vehicle had been left unlocked and the men entered through that.

Once inside the police vehicle they began smoking cigarettes and there was also evidence that they had spat on the ground.

They also used their cameras to take pictures of each other pretending that they were being arrested.

Letchford and Olson soon realised they were stuck inside and tried to kick through the metal cage that separates the rear of the vehicle from the driver's compartment, police said.

A friend who became worried when the pair did not return to the party wondered outside and noticed the pair were inside the van.

He wasn't able to open the door, which is understood to have had an automatic locking mechanism, called police at 3:57 a.m.

Connor was woken up by the authorities and he attended his van , promptly arresting the two men inside.

Police said that inside the van officers found cigarette butts and 'a large amount of saliva'.
