Grieving friends and relatives of the murdered Miss Honduras beauty queen and her sister have said goodbye at a double funeral.

Maria Jose Alvarado,19, was shot twice in the back as she tried to flee after seeing her sister, Sofia, 23, shot by her jealous boyfriend, police say.

In heartbreaking scenes the sisters' mother,Teresa Muñoz, hugged the two wooden caskets after they were bought to her home at dawn.  

More than 300 people attended the service, before the two women were buried in cement lined graves in a tiny cemetery near their hometown of Santa Barbara. 

'We are going to miss you; you will live in our hearts forever,' said 26-year-old Corina Alvarado, the victims' elder sister.  

Miss Alvarado and her sister Sofia were allegedly killed by Plutarco Antonio Ruiz - who flew into a jealous rage after seeing his girlfriend dance with another man.

Yesterday army soldiers and forensic teams recovered the bodies of the sisters buried in a river bank close to the spa where they disappeared six days ago.

Dozens of friends and relatives of the teenage beauty gathered for a candlelight vigil at the college she attended yesterday, remembering the down-to-earth young woman who dreamed of becoming a diplomat and who worked as a model to help support her poor family.

Ludin Reyes, a fellow student at the Technical University of Honduras, told Fox News: 'She was a simple, humble, a total innocent smiling and without malice.'

Yesterday the girls' devastated mother Teresa Munoz, told Televicentro that her daughters were tragically too trusting and friendly for their own good. 

She said: 'They were not very astute about assessing the people around them. They were just friendly. They were going out with people they hadn't known very long.'

She claimed Ruiz called her the following morning, acting nervous and claiming the young women had left the party in a car with some other people. 

General Ramon Sabillon, the National Police director, said Sofia's boyfriend Plutarco Antonio Ruiz had confessed to the killings on Tuesday and led authorities to the bodies in a mountainous area in Santa Barbara.

The bodies were found near La Aguagua spa, where the sisters had gone last Thursday to celebrate Ruiz's birthday.

Yesterday Alvarado's body, wrapped in brown plastic, was loaded into the back of a pickup truck just hours before she was to have boarded a flight to London to compete in the Miss World pageant. 

The sisters, who both grew up in the area, were shot to death and appeared to have been killed the night they disappeared, police said.

Officers said an accomplice, Aris Maldonado, was also being held. The two said they buried the bodies near the river so they would decompose quickly, according to Sabillon.

He said Ruiz allegedly shot his girlfriend, Sofia, because she was dancing with another man. After a fierce argument, he pulled out a pistol and fired at Sofia first, then Miss Honduras as she tried to flee. 

Ruiz (second from left) has since confessed to the killings, police say. Here he is pictured during his arrest

Sabillon said authorities were awaiting confirmation from forensic officials that the bodies were of Miss Alvarado and her sister.  

The BBC reported Leandro Osorio, the head of the country's Bereau of Criminal Investigation, as saying the two women's bodies had been found in Cablotales Village, near the Aguagua River.

He said: 'We are 100 per cent sure that it's them'.

The two young women disappeared on Thursday outside Honduras' northern city of Santa Barbara after a birthday party at a local resort, only days before Alvarado was set fly to London to compete in the Miss World competition.

During Plutarco's arrest, police also seized a pistol and two vehicles in the hope they will provide some clues towards what happened.

The case has caused consternation in the notoriously violent central American country, home to the most dangerous city on the planet. 

The Center for Women's Rights, based in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, issued a statement condemning the sisters' killing and highlighted that 328 women have been murdered in this Central American nation so far this year.

The group said: 'The case of Mary Jose and Sofia show clearly the situation of generalized violence against women and the nonexistent response of the Honduran government to prevent, investigate or punish it.'

San Pedro Sula, just over 30 miles from Santa Barbara where the girls were murdered, is the murder capital of the world with more than 1,200 killings a year among its nearly one million inhabitants. 

On the night they disappeared, Sofia arrived at a party on Thursday in a champagne-colored private car with unidentified men to pick up her sister at 6pm.

Police say the women were last seen leaving the party in the champagne-colored car.

The Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, tops the list of the world's most violent places on earth.

At least three murders are reported each day in the coffee-exporting nation, mostly at the hands of vicious gangs and drug cartels who operate freely in an area of lawlessness, poverty and a decaying justice system.

Gunmen have taken control of slums and villages, well aware that the police are ineffective and corrupt.

San Pedro Sula recorded 1,218 homicides in 2012 (a rate of 3.3 murders a day). It was followed by Acapulco, Mexico; Caracas, Venezuela and Distrito Central, Honduras.

The same year, it was reported that San Pedro Sula is saddled with one of South America's weakest economies - and nearly 70 per cent of the population live in poverty.

San Pedro Sula's murder rate of 169 per 100,000 people far surpasses anything in north America or much larger cities like Lagos or Sao Paulo.

Maria Jose described herself on a Miss World website profile as an aspiring diplomat who enjoys playing volleyball and football in her spare time.

She beat 18 contestants to win the Miss Honduras crown in April.

She missed an appointment on Sunday evening to try on the dress she hopes to win Miss World with.

Earlier this week, the women's mother Teresa de Jesus pleaded: 'Open your hearts and understand my pain.

'There is an all-powerful God that sees everything and I hope you set them free.' Miss World is due to kick off tomorrow, with 120 contestants competing for the crown.

The grand finale takes place on December 14 at ExCel London in the heart of the capital's Royal Docks area.

Swiss-born medical student Carina Tyrrell, 24, a qualified ski instructor and competition level gymnast, is representing England. 

Scotland is represented by media and marketing student Ellie McKeating, 20, from Glasgow. Ireland's representative is business studies student Jessica Hayes, 20, from Cork.
