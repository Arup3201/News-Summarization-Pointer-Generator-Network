Toxicology tests have revealed Adam Lanza had no alcohol or drugs in his body when he carried out his bloody massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School

Toxicology tests have revealed that Adam Lanza had no alcohol or drugs in his body when he shot and killed 20 first-graders and six women at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14.

The tests, conducted as part of the autopsy by state Chief Medical Examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver II, confirm there were neither illegal drugs nor antidepressants in his body.

It isn't known if Lanza, 20, took 
medication or used illegal drugs or alcohol. Search warrant records 
released by state police do not indicate whether drugs or alcohol were 
found when investigators searched the Newtown home Lanza shared with his
mother Nancy.

The warrants do indicate that 
unspecified medical records were found. Law enforcement sources have 
said that Lanza received some psychiatric care at an unspecified point 
and that state police obtained those records.

Other mass shooters have had histories 
of antidepressant use, but then stopped using their medication to have a 
clear head during their attacks.

Virginia Tech gunman Seung-Hui Cho 
had been prescribed Prozac but no traces of the drug were found in his 
system after the attack.

Lanza's test results support the theory that his attack was focused and well planned.

Former FBI profiler Mary Ellen O'Toole told Courant.com that Lanza's test results support the theory that his attack was focused and well planned.

'His thinking was not blurred or flawed in anyway,'' O'Toole said. She said the absence of anything in Lanza's system was consistent with someone thinking that 'I want to kill as many people as I can.'

Police warrants indicate that unspecified medical records were found at the house that Adam Lanza had shared with his mother Nancy

Depending on the drug, it can take several days for it to leave a person's system. Anti-psychotic drugs take the least time, while some drugs such as marijuana taking longer.

Danbury State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky has said he expects a final report on the state police investigation into the shooting to be released by the end of June.

In April it emerged that Lanza had been beaten and taunted by his fellow classmates while he was a student at Sandy Hook Elementary, and his mother had considered filing a lawsuit against the school.

Speaking exclusively with the New York Daily News, the relative said that the man who would grow up to murder his mother, Nancy, was viciously bullied by his classmates and would come home from class with bruises over his body.

Nancy Lanza was ‘irate’ in her belief that the educators at Sandy Hook weren’t doing all in their power to protect her son, they said.

The relative told the Daily News that 
Lanza wouldn’t confide in his mother when she asked him what was wrong. 
‘He would just sit there,’ the relative said.

Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14 and opened fire killing 26 people, including 20 children, before killing himself.

He had killed his mother, Nancy Lanza, in her bed before heading to the school.

Documents
released in April revealed how the 20-year-old had sprayed 155 bullets 
at innocent children and educators during a five-minute 
rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

The papers also revealed items seized from the home that Lanza shared with his mother.

Investigators confiscated an NRA guide to shooting and 
three other self-help books, 'Look at Me: My Life With Asperger's',
'Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Mind of an Autistic Savant' and 'Train 
Your Brain to Get Happy.'

In a top drawer of a filing cabinet, 
they found paper targets. In a duffel bag, they found ear and eye 
protection, binoculars, numerous other paper targets and an NRA 
certificate in his name. Another certificate was found in the home that belonged to Nancy Lanza, 52.

In 
response, the powerful gun-rights group denied the accuracy
of the police evidence, saying both Lanza and his mother had no links to the group.

'There is no record of a member 
relationship between Newtown killer Adam Lanza, nor between Nancy Lanza,
A. Lanza or N. Lanza with the National Rifle Association.

Reporting to 
the contrary is reckless, false and defamatory,' the statement said.

According to its website, the NRA doesn't offer formal certificates for membership.

The police dossier compiled in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre reveal Lanza had amassed an astonishing arsenal of guns, with thousands of rounds of ammunition, samurai swords, spears and three photographs of what appear to be a dead person covered in blood.

Denial: The NRA has refuted the accuracy of police evidence, denying that Lanza and his mother had links to the group

Search warrant affidavits relating to the Newtown school shootings were unsealed by a judge in Danbury at 9.01am this morning - providing a chilling picture of the mass murderer in the days before he killed 26 people, including 20 children at the Connecticut school in December.

The inventory of the evidence
seized from Lanza's home and the car he drove to carry out the massacre
provided glimpses into the world of a troubled young man, but it does 
not answer the question of what could have motivated the attack.

Investigators say it will take until June or later to complete the 
investigation.

Chief prosecutor Stephen Sedensky 
confirmed that Lanza killed all 26 victims inside Sandy Hook Elementary 
School with a Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle before taking his own life 
with a Glock 10 mm handgun.

He revealed Lanza had another loaded handgun with him inside the school as well as three, 30-round magazines for the Bushmaster.

When
his body was discovered, Lanza's Bushmaster was loaded with 30-round 
magazine of which 14 bullets still remained in place with one round in 
the chamber.

Upon entering the school, the police documents state that law officials discovered, 'numerous school children and school personnel located deceased from apparent gunshot wounds in the first three classrooms off the main hallway, adjacent to the school's front entrance'.

Adam Lanza's body was found dressed in military camouflage wearing a bullet-proof vest on the floor in the classroom.

All the weapons Lanza was carrying were legally owned by his mother, Nancy, 52,  who was discovered dead in her bed on the second-floor of the house she shared with her son with a gunshot wound to her forehead and a rifle on the floor nearby.

This new information from the police rules out any suggestion that Lanza tried to buy weapons himself before his massacre - which had been speculated previously.

A loaded 12-gauge shotgun was also 
found on the backseat of the Honda Civic Lanza drove to the school with 
two magazines containing 70 rounds of Winchester 12-gauge shotgun 
rounds.

The Associated Press and other news outlets have reported previously that Lanza showed interest in other mass killings and authorities found literature on other massacres at his house.

There have been reports that Lanza was obsessed with other mass killers, including Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in a shooting and bomb attack in Norway two years ago.

Among school shootings in the United States, the death toll from Newtown is second only to the 32 people killed at Virginia Tech in 2007.

Malloy announced last week that additional information would be released at his request. He expressed concern that some information about the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook reportedly disclosed by a top state police commander at a recent law enforcement seminar in New Orleans was leaked.

'Like many others, I was disappointed and angered to learn that certain information about the Newtown shooting had been leaked, specifically with concern for the victims' families who may have been hearing this news for the first time,' the governor said in a statement.

A column published last week in the New York Daily News, citing an unnamed police officer who attended the seminar, reported that Col Daniel Stebbins discussed evidence that suggested the Newtown gunman studied other mass slayings and dedicated extensive planning to the rampage.

The seminar was designed for only law enforcement professionals, and sensitive information dealing with the tactical approaches used by first responders to the Sandy Hook shootings was discussed, Connecticut State Police spokesman Lt J. Paul Vance said.

Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr. 
said this week that legislative leaders hope to review the search 
warrant documents before finishing work on a bipartisan bill that 
addresses gun control and other issues related to the massacre.
