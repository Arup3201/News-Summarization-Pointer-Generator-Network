A woman teacher was given ecstasy on a night out and she died after taking the drug at a local nightclub.

Mother-of-one Sarah Mayhew, 30, suffered a heart attack in the Six Feet Under nightclub car park after having a fatal reaction to the party drugs.

Friend Ian Bullock met Miss Mayhew and her boyfriend at the start of the night out - and gave her £40 of ecstasy.

She and her boyfriend then took a 
cocktail of the ecstasy, cocaine and mephadrone in a hotel room before 
going to the Six Feet Under nightclub.

A court heard the secondary school teacher became ‘very ill’ inside the club at Newport, Gwent, and died later that night.

Police interviewed boyfriend Roland 
Wicke and later arrested his friend Mr Bullock - described as a 'social 
drug user' rather than a big-time dealer.

Mr Bullock appeared at Cardiff Crown Court to plead guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A drug

Mr Bullock, 30, appeared at Cardiff Crown Court to plead guilty to possession with intent to supply Class A drug.

Scott Bowen, defending, said: 'He is remorseful and feels responsible for what happened.'

Judge Eleri Rees said about Mr 
Bullock: 'You are 30 years of age and everything I have read about you 
suggests you are a very selfish and self-centred man.

'It would appear you would appear to 
have started to face up to your responsibilities as a father but you 
must become free of drugs.'

Mr Bullock, of Newport, was sentenced to 15 months in prison suspended for 18 months and a drug rehabilitation scheme.

He was ordered to undergo monthly drug tests and will be called back to court if results show he is continuing his habit.

A post-mortem examination found her death was caused by a combination of mephedrone and ecstacy toxicity.

Miss Mayhew travelled from her home city of Bristol to Newport, South Wales, to meet her boyfriend at a Travelodge in the city.

An earlier inquest was held was where a coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure.

and she never stopped smiling.

‘She always wanted the best for her students.’

Former student Georgia May said: ‘You were the only teacher who would actually sit down and listen to my problems.

'Whenever I needed someone you were always there and you got me through half of my GCSEs.

'You made me keep my head down and always showed me the right directions in life.’
