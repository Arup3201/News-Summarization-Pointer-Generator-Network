Andrew Flintoff will finally make his much-hyped return to professional cricket in Lancashire's NatWest T20 Blast clash against Worcestershire at New Road.

Flintoff sensationally announced his return in May for Lancashire's Twenty20 campaign, almost five years after hanging up his boots following England's 2009 Ashes triumph at the Oval.

Back in the groove: The 36-year-old has not been needed by the Lancashire Lightning until now

The 36-year-old all-rounder has made a couple of appearances for the second XI side since confirming his return, even playing a 50-over match against Nottinghamshire where he thumped 40 off just 23 balls to help his side to victory.

Up until now, he has not been needed by the Lightning, who lie second in the North Division, but has now been given his chance to shine.

Flintoff, eighth in the order, did not have to bat as Lancashire posted a good total of 229-4 in their 20 overs, with Ashwell Prince top scoring on 68.
