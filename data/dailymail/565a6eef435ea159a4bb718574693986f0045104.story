Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl who was freed from captivity has been provisionally cleared of helping the enemy while he was held prisoner by the Taliban.

'We have no reason to believe that he engaged in any misconduct' during his five years in captivity, a U.S. Army official told the Wall Street Journal.

An investigation has been underway into whether Bergdahl deserted his post in June 2009 while he was stationed in a remote area of Afghanistan.

A classified investigation by the Army in 2009 found that the sergeant had left his post voluntarily.

The U.S. Army says Bergdahl has been released from inpatient care at Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas and the former prisoner of war in Afghanistan is now receiving outpatient care at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio

A probe was launched after Bergdahl was accused by members of his unit of desertion.

Bergdahl, 28, disappeared from his post 
in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan on June 30, 2009.

Some former
 members of his unit have said that he left of his own accord. Bergdahl 
has not commented publicly on the circumstances of his disappearance.

He was turned over to a U.S. military 
team by members of the Taliban on May 31, in exchange for the release of
 five Taliban leaders being held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center.

His former platoon mates have claimed that several soldiers were killed or injured during search missions for Bergdahl.

Senior U.S. Army officials said  that 
Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has not yet been interviewed by the two-star general 
appointed last week to investigate the matter.

They said he has not been read his legal rights and has not asked for a lawyer.

Officials have said the military 
team helping him recover from his imprisonment has told him that he is 
not immune from any subsequent charges, including anything linked to 
information he gives them now.

The Army officials said  that the investigation will examine whether Bergdahl went AWOL or if he deserted his post

One senior Army official said that any admission Bergdahl may blurt out during the debriefings could be used against him.

So far, Bergdahl has been cooperative and it appears he has not made any admissions that could be used against him.

The tenuous legal line is that the reintegration team is focusing on the five years he spent in captivity, not how he got there.

And Army officials said there is no suggestion that Bergdahl was guilty of any misconduct while he was held captive.

Bergdahl was initially treated at the 
Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, but is now receiving 
outpatient care at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas.

Army
 officials would not say Wednesday whether he has the ability to move 
freely on and off the base or if his movements are being constrained.

He is now in the final phase of his 'reintegration' at the center, where a staff psychologist will decide when he’s ready for release.

The process includes helping Bergdahl deal with the effects of five years in captivity, and could be completed within two weeks.

The official said Bergdahl has been cooperative and it appears he has not made any admissions that could be used against him

He has not admitted any wrongdoing, asked for a lawyer or talked with his parents in the three weeks since his release, according to reports.

He is also yet be questioned by the Army officials assigned to the investigation.

Maj.
 Gen. Kenneth R. Dahl, deputy commanding general of 1st Corps at Joint 
Base Lewis McChord in Washington state, is conducting the investigation 
with a deadline of mid-August.

His
 recommendations would be forwarded to the director of the Army staff, 
who could approve or alter them, and then forward them to Bergdahl's 
commander for any appropriate action.

The
 questions surrounding Bergdahl's disappearance also complicate his back
 pay. His pay was initially going into his bank account after he 
disappeared, but at a certain point the account became frozen due to 
inactivity.

If it is determined he went AWOL or deserted, he could be forced to repay money.

The road to rehabilitation: After his recovery process is completed, the Army will interview Bergdahl and decide if he should face disciplinary proceedings.

According to a U.S. official, Bergdahl
 accumulated more than $300,000 in back pay since he disappeared in June
 2009, but it's not clear how much of that has been frozen.

If
 it is determined that he did not go AWOL or desert his post, he also 
could receive roughly another $300,000 or more because he was a prisoner
 of war.

After his recovery process is completed, the Army will interview Bergdahl and decide if he should face disciplinary proceedings.

If Bergdahl is charged with desertion, he could face court-martial, prison time and possibly even the death penalty.
