Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov twice recovered from a set down to beat Marcos Baghdatis and book his place in the fourth round of the Australian Open on Friday.

Number 10 seed Dimitrov won 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 in a match lasting three hours and 28 minutes and played in a raucous atmosphere on court three at Melbourne Park.

Both players had noisy groups of fans bellowing their support and making the contest feel more like a Davis Cup tie than a third-round match in the year's first grand slam.

Baghdatis looked to be on course to make the fourth round when he went two sets to one up 

Baghdatis lost to Roger Federer in the Australian Open final in 2006 and went on to reach a career-high eighth in the world that year, but arrived in Melbourne ranked 78th.

The 29-year-old from Cyprus had lost to Ryan Harrison in the final of the Happy Valley Challenger in his previous tournament but took the opening set with a single break of serve.

Dimitrov, who reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year, claimed an early break in the second set and was leading 5-2 when Baghdatis called for a medical timeout and received treatment on what looked to be a hip injury.

Dimitrov went on to take the set, but Baghdatis won the third and looked on course to beat a top-20 player for the first time since the 2013 US Open, only for Dimitrov to force a decider after Baghdatis received more treatment late in the fourth set.

An early break of serve gave Dimitrov control of the decider and a second break wrapped up a hard-fought victory and secured a last-16 clash with sixth seed Andy Murray or Portugal's Joao Sousa.
