A couple who met after he 'poked' her on Facebook have now become engaged following a surprise proposal at the company's headquarters.

Steven Kawalit met his now fiancée Nafis Joon after she appeared on his timeline on the social networking site in 2007.

He decided to 'poke' her and, from that initial interaction, their relationship developed over the next seven years.

A man who met his girlfriend after he 'poked' on Facebook has proposed to her at the company's headquarters

Steven Kawalit met his now fiancée Nafis Joon after she appeared on his timeline on the social networking site in 2007

The couple are now engaged after Mr Nawalit took his partner to the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on the pretence that he had won a competition for a free tour.

But once there he surprised her with the proposal - surrounded by onlookers including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg.

Mr Nawalit, 32, got down on one knee in the middle of Hacker Square and said: 'When people ask us how we met, we say "mutual friends". And today you meet your mutual friends.

'Nafis, I love you very much. You're my best friend. Will you marry me?'

Mr Nafalis arranged for the message 'Nafis, will you marry me?' to appear on a screen in the square

Miss Joon at first looked a little surprised to see the message on the screen

She then covered her face with her hands as the full realisation of what was happening set in

To the delight of onlookers, she said 'Yes'.

Mr Kawalit told ABC News: 'It was funny how I jumped on the social network to catch up with long-lost friends and ended up meeting the love of my life.'

Last month it was reported how, in another extravagant plan, firefigthter Jesse Gonzalez managed to completely surprise his police officer girlfriend and propose to her at a fake house fire.

With the help of two Houston Fire Department stations and the Houston Police Department, Mr Gonzalez emerged like a hero from a smouldering garage in full fire-gear to get down on one knee to the sounds of Bruno Mars' Marry Me.

His girlfriend Olga Peck looked stunned as she accepted his proposal, telling him: 'I love you, I can't wait to marry you and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'

Mr Kawalit then got down on one knee as he asked Miss Joon to marry him

To the delight of onlookers in the square, she said 'yes' and the couple embraced
