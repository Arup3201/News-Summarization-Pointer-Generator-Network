Fogarty, 49, beat former X Factor contestant Jake Quickenden and TV presenter Melanie Sykes to the title in the final of the ITV show.

And Fogarty, who won four world championships during his illustrious career, ranked his jungle success higher than any of his sporting achievements.

Fogarty told the show's presenters Ant and Dec it was 'the best thing that has ever happened' 

The motorcyclist broke down in tears as he took his place on the throne in front of his fellow camp-mates before wrapping his arms around his wife.

He told presenters Ant and Dec: 'I just think it's all a dream, someone's playing a trick on me.

'This is the best thing that has ever happened to me. It's absolutely mental. I don't know what, but I must have done something right.'

Speaking specifically of his 'bromance' with former footballer Jimmy Bullard, who was the first celbrity to be voted off the show, Fogarty said: 'I got very emotional when he left.

'He was my best mate in there and I was gutted when he left. I thought he was a dead cert to stay in, so I fell apart like a cheap watch with the shock. That was a tough morning'. 

He endured three weeks in the Australian jungle braving grim Bushtucker Trials to beat 11 other celebrities. 

His final gruesome task saw him determinedly tackle an unappetising meal of testicles, ostrich anus and camel penis.

He beat former X Factor contestant Jake Quickenden who came second after braving burrowing cockroaches and crabs in his final task.

The self-proclaimed 'clown' was little known before the show started, having appeared in X Factor just weeks before he entered the jungle .

The singer, who came in late to the show, joked how 'people voted for me more on this then when I was a singer', referring to his X Factor bid.

TV presenter Melanie Sykes was the first of the three to be voted off the show after being forced to submerge herself in a tank filled with eels and crabs.

After leaving the two men behind in the camp she said: 'I'm a bit gutted that I'm not in the final because you get so close and you think I might do it.

Quickenden had been the favourite going into the final, according to bookmaker Coral 

The show's other contestants, including Melanie Sykes who finished third, watched the final together

'It was better than I expected. I had fun, I made great friends. I don't want to sound corny but it's exceeded all my expectations.'

She said she mastered 'counting to 10' in the camp after admitting it was hard for her to watch other people cooking - a point of contention throughout the competition.

The finalists enjoyed a slap-up meal to mark their last night on the show after all three won the final tasks.

On Saturday night former Tory politician Edwina Currie was voted off the show, revealing that despite previously comparing the show to childbirth it was a 'privilege and a pleasure'.

Quickenden had been the favourite going into the final, according to bookmaker Coral, which said he had been 'very popular with the betting public ever since he set foot into the jungle'.
