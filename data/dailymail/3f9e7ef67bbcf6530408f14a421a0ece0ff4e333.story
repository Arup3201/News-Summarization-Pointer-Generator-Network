'Brighton & Hove Albion can confirm two arrests were made at yesterday's match against Birmingham City: one on suspicion of use of racist language, in relation to an historic offence; and one for throwing a smoke bomb onto the pitch from the away end,' said the club's statement.

'The arrest on suspicion of use of racist language was made after a complaint and subsequent statement was made to the club on Saturday morning that racist language was used prior to a previous home match, by an individual watching a televised match in the stadium concourse.

'The suspect was identified by the club's CCTV staff and stewards, before being ejected from the stadium and handed over to Sussex Police.
