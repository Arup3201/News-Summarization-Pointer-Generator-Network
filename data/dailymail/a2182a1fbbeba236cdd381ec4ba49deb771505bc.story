A Pennsylvania police officer who made headlines when he won a $1 million Powerball drawing last month has been suspended because of the alleged actions of his wife.

Rankin Officer Matthew Brown is named in a criminal complaint charging his wife with working as a scheduler for a prostitution business.

Their defense attorney David Shrager insist officer Brown and his wife, Jennifer, have done nothing wrong.

Charged: The police officer Michael Brown who bought a $1 million Powerball ticket is named in a police complaint against his wife, Jennifer Brown, who faces charges, including promoting prostitution

Sordid site: Jennifer Brown allegedly was involved with 69 Entertainment and ran the daily operations as one of the schedulers of the agency. her police officer husband was a driver and worked as security

Shrager says the business in question provides 'bachelor party services', not prostitution.

'They're denying these charges. Certainly, I have not seen any evidence that would allow me to believe that there is enough for him to be charged,' said Mr Shrager.

The officer, who has not been charged, is nonetheless named as being a driver and working security for the business.

Jennifer Brown is charged with conspiracy to promote prostitution – a felony – and other counts, through an Internet site called sixtynineentertainment.com.

Among ads for lap dances and strip teases, court documents say the adult entertainment agency posted Internet ads on Pittsburgh Backpage Escort, a site where prostitutes solicit customers.

The complaint said the website is 'known by law enforcement as a site where known female, male and transsexual prostitutes post ads soliciting for customer/johns.'

Suspended: Officer Brown applied last year for a job as a part-time police officer in Rankin and joined the department in November

Jennifer Brown's attorney, David Shrager, said his client has pleaded not guilty, and that the case lacks evidence and they're waiting for their day in court.

Investigators said employees told them Jennifer Brown served as the scheduler who ran daily operations with Matthew Brown working as a driver.

Police Chief Ryan Wooten says he’s taken Brown off the schedule until he and borough council decide what to do with the officer.

'It's surprising, very surprising. I wasn't aware of this,' said Rankin Police Chief Ryan Wooten to Action 4 News.

Wooten said he hired Matthew Brown about a year ago before Brown's name showed up in the police complaint against his wife.

Benefit of the doubt: Rankin Police Chief Wooten believes his officer will be proven innocent of any involvement but is suspending Brown until the investigation is completed

'I mean, I did his background check. I'm going to say that's unfounded. You're going to have the good and bad. He's blessed with a lot of money. So someone is going to throw something negative in there, and that's the negative part,' said Wooten.

Even if he is struck off, financially the Brown family will not be suffering financially after their recent windfall.

Brown won the lottery back in May after playing the Powerball.

He spent $6 on three Quick Picks and didn't realize he had won until a few days later.

'At first, I didn't believe it. I thought someone was playing a joke on me,' he told the lottery.

After checking the ticket at the store, he called his wife, Jennifer, to tell her the news.

'She thought I was joking and hung up on me,' he said.
