Labour was last night urged to stop taking unpaid help from an accountancy giant accused by MPs of promoting tax avoidance schemes on an ‘industrial scale’.

Senior Labour politicians – including members of Ed Miliband’s frontbench team – have accepted more than £500,000 worth of free help and advice from PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Ed Balls, Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt are among them. The revelation is particularly damaging because PwC has placed its staff in Labour teams drawing up official policies on economic issues, including tax.

Margaret Hodge, the chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee and a senior Labour MP, said the secondment of PwC staff to work in the offices of opposition frontbenchers was ‘inappropriate’.

‘The Conservatives took money from PricewaterhouseCoopers when they were in opposition, the Labour Party does and probably the Liberal Democrats too. I think that’s inappropriate, I wouldn’t do it,’ she told Radio 4’s The World at One.

Her comments came after the PAC issued a blistering report condemning the way that PwC devised ‘complex strategies and contrived structures’ to help big companies dramatically reduce their tax bills.

In a statement, PwC said that its secondees provided ‘limited and fully disclosed technical support’. Mrs Hodge said that the rules governing such arrangements were too weak and needed to be tightened.

Analysis of the Register of Members Interests shows that PwC spent a total of £547,565 seconding their staff to work in the offices of many of Mr Milliband’s frontbench team.

A total of 11 Labour MPs have had a member of the company working in their Westminster offices in the last year. Mr Balls, the shadow chancellor, has had two members of staff from the accountancy firm working with him, worth the equivalent of £64,162.

Chuka Umunna (left) and Tristram Hunt (right) are also among the MPs said to have listed PwC staff working in their offices. Mr Umunna had research assistants worth £99,500 and Mr Hunt had one at value of £74,655

On three occasions, Mr Umunna, the shadow business secretary, lists having had PwC research assistants working in his office, a perk worth £99,550. Mr Hunt, the shadow education secretary, also had a research assistant for six months at a value of £74,655.

Labour defended the arrangements, saying that PwC had provided long-standing support to all three main political parties on a non-party basis.

The firm said: ‘PwC has no political affiliation. We do not develop policy on their behalf.’
