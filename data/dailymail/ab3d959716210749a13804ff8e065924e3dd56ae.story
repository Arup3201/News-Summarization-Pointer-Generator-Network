Perhaps she's intending to settle down with toyboy lover Casper Smart, or she doesn't want younger contenders Britney Spears and Demi Lovato to overshadow her on rival gig X Factor USA.

But it seem Jennifer Lopez is sidestepping from her role as American Idol judge.

The 42-year-old has now revealed it is unlikely she will return for a third season to the Fox series.

Speaking on the Today show, the mother-of-two mused: 'Maybe it's time for me to go. It's been on my mind a lot, as you can imagine, and now it's like, "Do we continue on this journey?"

'I've loved it so much. I enjoy the show so much... It's a tough decision either way.'

The Jenny From The Block singer stressed that whichever route she takes, will not be an easy one.

She added: 'At the end of the day, whichever way, it's a heartbreaking decision if I'm going to have to go.'

However, it is unlikely she will be at a loss of working projects, claiming she put many other offers 'on hold' for the reality show.

Meanwhile, fellow panellist and Aerosmith star Steven Tyler has confirmed his departure.

In a statement released today, the father of famous actress Liv Tyler, said: 'After some long... hard thoughts... I’ve decided it’s time to let go of my mistress American Idol before she boils my rabbits.'

The 64-year-old was making reference to a scene from the film Fatal Attraction - in which a deranged woman kills her lover's daughter's pet rabbit.

He went on: 'I strayed from my first love, Aerosmith, and I'm back - but instead of begging on my hands and knees, I've got two fists in the air and I'm kicking the door open with my band.'

This means the fate of final judge Randy Jackson will no doubt hang in the balance, as rumours are rife that he may no longer be a judge, as Mariah Carey in 'serious talks' to sign on.

In an effort to keep the show fresh and hip, E!
News have reported that Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry are being sought 
after, as well as Nicky Minaj, Fergie and former contestant Adam Lambert.

J Lo also shed light on her latest silver screen role in Ice Age: Continental Drift, in which she loaned her vocals to the role of Shira.

She said: 'Having kids (twins Max and Esme), it's always going to be interesting getting involved in an animated project and be involved in something they really enjoy, because everything else I do they don't care about! One of my favourite things is to stay in bed and watch movies with them.'
