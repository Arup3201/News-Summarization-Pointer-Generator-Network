Brendan Rodgers has recalled every one of the seven players he 'rested' at the Bernabeu for the clash against Chelsea.

Steven Gerrard, Mario Balotelli, Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson, who were on the bench for the 1-0 defeat by Real Madrid, and Dejan Lovren who was left out completely, came back for Saturday's lunchtime kick-off.

Rodgers always had one eye on the clash against Chelsea as Liverpool look to kick-start their season and get back into the top four.

The Liverpool manager said of his choices for Madrid: 'I put out the best team to get a result. I thought the players were magnificent. I know there has been criticism but it does the players a disservice.'

Rodgers was criticised for leaving out the seven players in the Bernabeu but Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher offered him support in his column.

Carragher wrote: 'Brendan Rodgers felt the Chelsea game would be the biggest of Liverpool’s week.'

'Rodgers has received some scathing criticism for making seven changes but I am not going to join the chorus of disapproval. Some of his decisions I didn’t agree with, others I could completely understand.'

The selection meant there was no room in the starting XI for Kolo Toure despite his superb showing against Real.

Whether Rodgers' changes in midweek were justified will be clearer at 2.30pm on Saturday.
