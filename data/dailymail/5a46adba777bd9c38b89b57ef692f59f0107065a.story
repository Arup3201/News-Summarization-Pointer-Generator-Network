She has won four British Style Awards, inspired Mulberry's best-selling bag and was even dubbed 'beautiful' by 'king of mean', Karl Lagerfeld.

And now, as one of fashion's most famous muses, Alexa Chung has given fans the chance to emulate her look with her own make-up range.

The 29-year-old model, TV presenter and fashionista has teamed up with indie brand Eyeko to launch a range of cosmetics - and FEMAIL can bring you an exclusive first look.

In her new role as Creative Consultant at Eyeko, Alexa has used her beauty know-how, as well as her illustrative and photographic talents to custom design the first in a line of limited edition sets.

To launch the range the star has created a thick nib eyeliner and a mascara so that beauty aficionados can re-create her signature cat flick eyes.

The products, which have quirky names such as 'eye do' liquid eyeliner, come in a specially designed poster tubes featuring a limited edition poster with scribbles by the star herself, as well as a kooky guitar pick.

Speaking about her eyeliner, she said: 'The nib is the perfect shape and size to give you control. It gives you the precision to draw on the perfect cat eye.

'It’s pitch black and waterproof so it doesn’t move even on the waterline. I love that it enhances my lashes each time I use it.'

Speaking about her mascara, which is packed with Vitamins A & E, Keratin, Ginkgo Biloba and botanical proteins that claim to promote lash growth, she said: 'I love a sixties doe-eyed look and this gives me longer, thicker, blacker lashes without the hassle of falsies.

'It stays on forever but feels amazing thanks to all the lash enhancing magic in the mix.'

'I'm really excited to be working with Eyeko. It is probably no secret I'm a big fan of the cat-eye eyeliner flick and after trying many different brands Eyeko definitely is the best in creating my favourite 60s look.'

Established in 1999, Eyeko was 
devised by make-up veterans and partners Max and Nina Leykind and is 
loved by stars such as Jennifer Lawrence, Salma Hayek and Gemma 
Arterton.

'I love that I won't be just a face of the brand, but I'll also get to work with Max and Nina on the whole creative process,

'It’s a creative relationship,' she said of the company, 'I send images and different inspirations to Max and Nina and we go from there. It’s quite free form at the moment.'

'She’ll e-mail us in the middle of the night and say, "Hey, what about this, such a cool name for a product,"' said Nina Leykind.

'I don’t think it would work if we weren’t on the same wavelength.'

For the Leykinds, no other spokesperson would have been acceptable. 'We’ve been fans of Alexa’s for a long time, and we were like, "She’s an eye freak like us,"' said Max Leykind.

'She’s as obsessed as we are.'

Speaking about the new range, fashion and beauty blogger Tanya Burr said: 'I am really excited to try Alexa's collaboration with Eyeko.

'I have always admired her classic, sultry eye make-up and I've actually been wearing winged liner a lot at the moment.'

Alexa, who counts herself as a Contributing Editor to British Vogue and Style Ambassador for the British Fashion Council, seems set on building an empire.

She recently turned author and penned a book - titled It - which invites fashion fans into her stylish world.

The fashion favourite shares 
tips for dressing for certain occasions along with whimsical musings and
wry observations she says she penned to her editor in a series of 
emails.

Published by Penguin Books, the tome features the fashion 
muse's own sketches and hand-picked photographs of friends and style icons, like Jane Birkin, who have inspired her.

Alexa describes her 
offering as an 'image-heavy autobiography' that provides an honest insight 
into heartbreak, boys and, of course, style.

She provides advice on how to 
party at music festivals, get dressed for the gym, and what music to 
listen to after a break-up.

And now with a book under her belt, Alexa says she is keen to develop her career further, with forays into music and acting.

Alexa Chung for Eyeko will cost £35 per set and be exclusively pre-launched at 
Selfridges, Oxford Street London on November 14 where she will be meeting and greeting fans.

FROW: As a front row regular, Alexa possesses all the best insider knowledge

Desperate to emulate Alexa's signature cat flick eyeliner and smokey eyed look, FEMAIL writer Bianca London put her new range to the test...

'A lot of girls want to look like Alexa, she has that "just rolled out of bed" indie girl style so when she unveiled her debut make-up range, we were keen to give it a spin.

The mascara is good, very thick and lasts all day and it's good to know that it's helping to condition your lashes whilst you wear it.

It's pretty tough to get off though, we recommend using a gentle eye make-up remover like The Body Shop's Camomile Kind Eye remover as it can be quite stubborn.

As for the eyeliner, if you have the knack for applying it, it looks great. However, it is very, very black so may be too heavy on some fair-haired ladies.

The packaging is what wins us over and would be great as a Christmas stocking filler.'
