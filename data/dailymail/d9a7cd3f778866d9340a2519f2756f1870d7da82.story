Yesterday saw the Countess of Wessex tour the set, accompanied by the Mexican First Lady, Angélica Rivera.

Now Kensington Palace has announced that Downton Abbey is to have a second royal visitor, this time, the Duchess of Cambridge.

Kate, 33, will travel to Ealing Studios in London, where she will be shown around the set and introduced to cast members, among them Dame Maggie Smith who plays the formidable Dowager Countess.

Other cast members due to be introduced to the Duchess include Phyllis Logan, who plays Mrs Hughes, and Hugh Bonneville and Elizabeth McGovern who play the Earl and Countess of Grantham.

The Duchess, who is eight months pregnant with her second child, will also watch a scene being filmed and be shown a walkway crammed with memorabilia detailing the history of Ealing Studios.

The cast are currently filming series six of the long-running ITV drama, with cast and crew splitting their time between Ealing and locations such as Highclere Castle in Berkshire which stands in for the eponymous Downton Abbey.

Downton is, of course, no stranger to royal visits having previously hosted the Countess of Wessex and, in 2011, royal in-laws Carole, Michael and Pippa Middleton.

The drama also boasts several royal fans, among them the Duchess of Cornwall who confessed to being a 'Downton addict' when she met cast member Lesley Nichol (Mrs Patmore) last year.

Another fan of the drama is the Duchess of Cambridge who, in 2011, told Jessica Findlay-Brown, who played Lady Sybil that she and Prince William are both avid viewers.

One royal who is yet to visit is the Queen, although she did get a taste of life on set when she visited the cast of Game of Thrones in Belfast last year.

Although Her Majesty declined to sit on the infamous Iron Throne, she did reference the TV series during the 2014 Queen's speech.

Downton creator Julian Fellowes has also been known to write the royals, albeit historical ones, into the series with the 2013 season including a storyline about Edward VIII and his first great love, Freda Dudley-Ward.

The story focused on Lady Rose's debut which, in the series, was staged at Buckingham Palace and, in one scene, saw her dance in the arms of the future king who was played by Oliver Dinsdale.

His father, George V, also made an appearance in the 2013 Christmas episode, with the Queen's grandfather portrayed by Guy Williams.
