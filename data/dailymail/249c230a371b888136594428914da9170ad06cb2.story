A nine-year-old boy and his grandfather have died after falling through a frozen lake while ice-skating.

Gérard Payeur, 64, and his grandson, Nicolas Payeur, nine, were on a small lake on Friday near the grandfather’s home in Ascot 
Corner, outside Sherbrooke, Quebec.

The boy's grandmother, who jumped into the freezing water to save them, is in hospital suffering from hypothermia but is expected to survive.

Gone too soon: Nicolas Payeur, nine, died on Friday when he fell through thin ice with his grandfather in Quebec

Dave Benneth, the boy's uncle, told reporters he couldn't understand why they went out on the ice so early in the season

Nicolas's family saw them plunge into the water and called emergency services who got the pair to a hospital late on Friday afternoon.

Gérard died shortly after being admitted to the hospital. Nicolas passed away early ion Saturday morning.

Nicolas's uncle Dave Benneth told reporters that he did not understand why Gérard allowed the boy to go out on the ice when it was so thin.

'I imagine he wanted to make Nicolas happy by agreeing to go 
skating,' Benneth told La Tribune.

'Once he was on the dock, Nicolas put
on his skates and pushed a hockey puck out into the middle of the lake.
It was probably when he skated out to get it that the ice broke. Gérard
would have tried to save him, but he also fell into the lake.'

A family neighbor said there was barely an inch of ice at the time.

There were a total of 145 drowning deaths during recreational activities on ice in Canada from 1991 to 2000, according to the Canadian Red Cross Society and the 
Canadian Surveillance System for Water-Related Fatalities. Of those deaths, eleven were skaters.

Canadians are often overconfident during the winter, underestimating the danger from drowning in waterways covered in ice and snow, according to the the
Canadian Lifesaving Society.

Ice must be at least four  inches thick before it is considered safe for an individual to walk across.

In his interview, Mr Benneth said that Nicolas's father had run out onto the lake himself to try and save them while the grandmother pushed a sailboard towards the broken ice.

Police are investigating the incident.
