A blonde transsexual former escort wailed on the witness stand on Monday that she still loves the New York firefighter accused of beating her.

Claudia Charriez, 31, looked longingly at the defense table where Taylor Murphy, 29, was sitting. Murphy, her ex-boyfriend, was a hunky model for the FDNY charity calendar.

He is on trial facing charges that he viciously beat Miss Charriez - a flamboyant model - in August 2011.

'I do love him!' Miss Charriez told jurors as Murphy's lawyers cross-examined her, the New York Post reports.

Miss Charriez admitted, under questioning, to several inconsistencies in her report to police.

She also admitted to sending numerous
love-and-hate text messages to Murphy after the alleged beating - 
including telling him after his arrest 'Enjoy sucking your cell mate's 
d***.'

When she was confronted with these messages, Miss Charriez began sobbing.

'I do love you,' she shouted, looking over at Murphy in the courtroom. Murphy did not make eye contact and stared at his hands instead.

Murphy is accused of punching, biting and spitting on Miss Charriez during a fight in their Manhattan hotel room.

On Tuesday Kristin M Davis, the madam
at the center of the prostitution scandal that brought down New York 
Gov Eliot Spitzer, is expected to testify.

Miss Davis will reportedly recount 
two phone calls she received in which Miss Charriez made threats against
Murphy. Miss Davis knows Murphy from his work on her 2010 gubernatorial
campaign.

On Thursday, Miss Charriez was 
questioned about her sexually-transmitted disease, experiences as an 
escort and deceased ex-boyfriend as defense lawyers went on the attack.

Attorneys for Taylor Murphy, 29, attempted to damage Charriez's
credibility during fierce questioning. Their client stands accused of a
vicious attack on the transgender model in August 2011.

According to the New York Daily News, Murphy's defense attorney Jason Berland began by asking the former call-girl, who was kicked off American's Next Top Model in 2006 for being born a man, about her venereal disease.

'You (worked as an escort) knowing that you could potentially transmit that disease?' asked Berland.

'I was an escort, not a prostitute. I do not have sex for money,' Charriez replied.

'Whether
or not I chose to engage in sexual activity with someone - protected - 
was my choice,' she said. 'What does this have anything to do with him 
hurting me?'

'Hunky': Taylor Murphy is best known for his topless firefighters calendar. In court yesterday a woman burst into court with the image, screaming 'I love you Taylor.'

Berland asked the model as to why she
charged her clients $300 per hour if she wasn’t offering sex. The 
defense claims that at one point her hourly rate jumped to $600.

'Dinner dates. Accompanied them on many different occasions,' replied Charriez.

The defense inquired if the model had been taking estrogen over the period in question.

'I don’t need hormone therapy because at a very young age I was castrated,'  Charriez claimed.

Berland then asked her about a deceased former boyfriend, allegedly the subject of tension between Murphy and Charriez.

The model was upset by this line of 
questioning and screamed 'You shouldn’t talk about dead people' as she 
was escorted out of the courtroom.

Murphy is accused of assaulting his ex-lover, Charriez, in the summer of 2011. 

The
firefighter previously worked 
with Engine 59 and Engine 7, Ladder 1 in lower Manhattan. He is best 
known as Mr March in a 2011 firefighters calendar. But the FDNY said the
calendar Murphy posed in was not affiliated with the department.
