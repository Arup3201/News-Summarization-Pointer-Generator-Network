For most skiers, it is hard enough to try and complete a jump, but this professional managed to pull-off the ultimate stunt... and captured it on film.

Nineteen-year-old Norwegian skier Johan Berg showed off serious skills in a recent Instagram video, by high-fiving a fellow skier while completing a jump.

In the footage, Berg, a free-skier who works with brands Völkl and O'Neill, launches himself upside down to give an epic high-five to his friend and Sochi Olympian, Aleks Aurdal.

Once he completes the impressive feat, Aurdal cheers and laughs as Berg continues down the hill.

An Oslo native, Berg first began his career at the age of 11.

In 2010 and 2011, he went on to claim the title of Norwegian Champion, and since, has competed on an international level.

The 'proper high-five' as Berg refers to it on Instagram was filmed at the Stubai Glacier Prime Park Sessions in Austria, though he's known to frequent the tiny ski village of Vierli when he has the time.

Recently, it seems that Berg and Aurdal have been recording a series of stunt videos, along with the hashtag #AleksVsJohan, where they show off their adventurous tricks.
