A top Harley Street doctor has denied stealing a wallet stuffed with £2,500 cash from Starbucks, insisting he thought it was his because he often carries several at a time.

Abdul Choudhuri claimed he owns at least 20 wallets and that when he heard a wallet had been handed in at a Starbucks in Nottingham, he asked staff for it back in the genuine belief it was his.

After claiming the wallet, which had actually been mislaid by a traveller from Singapore and handed in to staff, the 41-year-old doctor was arrested when he returned to the scene of the alleged fraud a month later.

'Thoroughly dishonest': Prosecutors described Abdul Choudhuri as 'highly manipulative' in court after it was alleged that he dishonestly claimed a wallet with £2,500 in cash handed in at a Starbucks cafe

Dr Choudhuri, who provides cosmetic surgery and 
private medical treatments through his business with clinics in 
London, Nottingham, Beverly Hills and Monaco, is also accused of 
attempting to pervert the course of justice after a key witness 
allegedly received a phone call from either him or ‘someone acting on 
his behalf’ posing as an official and claiming the trial had been 
postponed.

Prosecutors have described him as ‘a 
thoroughly dishonest and highly manipulative individual who has gone to 
extreme lengths in order to avoid conviction’.

But in giving evidence in his own defence at Nottingham Crown Court, Dr Choudhuri denied he had done anything wrong.

He claimed he routinely carried 
several wallets - one for each of his separate medical businesses and 
family matters. He told jurors that on the 
day the wallet, which belonged to Singaporean tourist Kenny Quek, went 
missing in October 2010, he had at least 20 with him in a ‘man bag’.

Several wallets: Dr Choudhuri claimed to own at least 20 wallets and carried several at a time, so when he heard one had been handed in, which had a 1,000 dollar Singapore note (pictured), at Starbucks he asked for it back, genuinely believing it was his

He added he was ‘all fingers and 
thumbs’ at the time because he was the coffee shop with his wife, Fatima
Jabbar, who is also a qualified doctor, and their five-week-old son.

He said he had taken her to the 
Starbucks, in Nottingham city centre, as a treat because she had endured
a difficult breech birth, and was experiencing post-natal depression.

Dr Choudhuri also claimed to have 
been hit by a number of recent family problems, including the death of 
an uncle and his mother suffering a stroke.

Asked by Jeremy Dein QC, defending, 
if he had gone to the counter and dishonestly claimed the wallet, he 
replied: ‘No, I did not.’

The court has heard how Mr Quek 
returned to the Starbucks, in Nottingham city centre, hours after 
realising he had left his wallet behind, only to be told it had been 
claimed by another man.

It contained £2,500 and a 1,000 dollar Singapore note worth around £500.

Dr Choudhuri was arrested a month 
later when he returned to the coffee shop and was seen acting ‘shiftily’
by barista Lisa Wright.

The court heard that when police 
arrived, the British-born doctor allegedly went to the toilets and did 
not emerge for two minutes.

Jonathan Straw, prosecuting, said 
that an officer heard a series of banging noises and believed Dr 
Choudhuri was trying to hide or flush something away.

He added that after his arrest 
minutes later, Dr Choudhuri claimed to know a superintendent with 
Nottingham Police and said officers would ‘lose their jobs’.

But Dr Choudhuri told the court he 
was in the toilet sterilising his son’s bottle, and denied he had ever 
claimed they would be fired.

Jurors have heard that when he was 
searched after his arrest, a 1,000 dollar Singapore note was found in a 
wallet he was carrying.

However, Dr Choudhuri said movie 
stars and members of royal families from the Middle and Far East, 
including ‘princesses with Mulberry handbags full of money’ were among 
his clients and many often paid with currency from their own countries.

He said some customers preferred to 
pay in cash because their faiths forbade them to use credit and that 
must have been why he was carrying the Singaporean cash.

Dr Choudhuri said he trained in 
medicine at Liverpool University where he graduated in the top ten of 
his class of 200, before completing his studies at a Cambridge teaching 
hospital.

He became a NHS GP in Nottingham in 2004, then turned private and opened his Harley Street clinic in 2010.

He told the court his business - Body
Perfect Clinic - grew rapidly, and that he provided cosmetic surgery 
and medical services to thousands of people.

Dr Choudhuri, whose postmaster father
came to the UK from Hong Kong at the age of 16, said his wife worked at
his Harley Street clinic, adding: ‘All the royal princesses would 
always go to her. She was always in demand.’

Jurors heard that by autumn 2010, his
tax bill alone was more than £100,000 and he often gave away thousands 
of pounds to charities.

Asked by his barrister if he had ever
broken the law, Dr Choudhuri replied: ‘I’ve always made it my mantra to
respect the police and stay out of trouble.’

However, the court was told that 
after his arrest, he sent a text message to his wife that read: ‘If pigs
ask you anything, it is always no comment. Don’t tell them anything.’

Dr Choudhuri said he could not 
explain the message but that he was not acting himself because he was 
‘bemused, shocked and scared’.

He later told police in an interview:
‘I have worked 18 to 20 hours days since I was 21. Prior to that it was
education, education, education, and you think I would throw all that 
up the wall to steal a wallet?’

Dr Choudhuri is also accused of 
trying to set up a false alibi, by pressuring his accountant into saying
a meeting the pair had on the day the wallet was claimed took place at 
4pm, when in fact it was 10.30am.

Dr Choudhuri, of Nottingham, denies fraud and two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice.

The trial continues.
