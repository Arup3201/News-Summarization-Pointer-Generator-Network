A mystery white van man filmed battering a cyclist in a vicious road rage attack has been let off without prosecution and only asked to write a letter of apology to his victim.

Stephen Perrin, who wears a camera on his cycling helmet, was dragged off his bike and hit by the 36-year-old man close to a Birmingham police station.

The footage shows the van driver overtaking Mr Perrin before pulling over and hitting him, shouting: 'you f****** p****, I'll f****** knock you out.'

Row: Olympic Gold medallist Chris Boardman has got involved after police only told the man to pay compensation and say sorry

West Midlands Police said the attacker was interviewed under caution at a police station, but was punished with a 'local resolution', claiming its 'hands were tied'.

This agreement, introduced by the force three years ago, means the aggressor will pay the cyclist compensation and offer a written apology.

The shocking footage has gone viral since Former Olympic cycling champion Chris Boardman saw it and shared it with his 80,000 followers on Twitter.

He retweeted: 'Get Britain cycling:? There's a lot to do when @wmpolice think it's okay NOT to charge/warn 4 this.'

Footage: After an altercation on the road, the attacker got out of his van and gave chase

Floored: The cyclist was then dragged to the ground during an attack where the blows are heard clearly

Clambering: To avoid further punches Stephen scrambles to his feet on the Birmingham pavement

Mr Perrin and scores of other cyclists have reacted with anger that police failed to act, who stated they were powerless due to Home Office guidelines.

West Midlands Police responded on Twitter to Mr Boardman saying: 'Cyclist accepts under Home Office guidance that officers' hands were tied and were unable to take him to court.'

Writing on Facebook, Mr Perrin said: 'This was obviously totally unprovoked-the internet has named and shamed him. This is all very overwhelming and I'm a little bit frightened.'

Referring to himself as 'CCStev' on Twitter, he added: 'This was a violent, unprovoked attack that has no place in society and I'm very disappointed and angry that the driver will not face criminal consequences.

'The driver was brought in for interview and initially claimed provocation, that I kicked his van and kicked him in the chest.

'As the victim I was given the choice of the driver receiving a caution or I could accept a local resolution, the terms of which that I would receive an amount in compensation and a written apology. I'm far from happy about it but reluctantly accepted the resolution.

'I don't think the police are to blame but the decisions made by Government departments that govern them.'

Abuse: After the initial attack the white van man, 36, then swore and threatened more violence

Withdrawal: With a bus stopped next to his vehicle the attacker then tells the cyclist to call the police if he likes

He was riding along Woodbridge Road in the affluent Moseley suburb of the city on March 16 when the incident happened.

An eyewitness said: 'It was a very brutal and unprovoked attack so I am very surprised to hear the guy has got away with it. The driver went mad and kept punching the cyclist. He was very angry - a case of small man syndrome if you ask me.

'As a cyclist myself, it is unnerving to know that people can get away with this sort of violent behaviour.'

Mr Perrin calls himself 'Black Country Ste' on Twitter and Youtube and has uploaded more than 100 videos from his travels around Birmingham, some of which result in verbal confrontations with drivers.

The footage has now been removed from YouTube, due to its policy on 'shocking and disgusting content.'

Police Station: West Midlands Police's Moseley HQ, within sight of where the attack happened

The van is operated by a pet business based in Moseley called Weird and Wonderful, which has deleted its Facebook and Twitter accounts as a result of the complaints it was receiving from cyclists. The company has also disabled the online feedback form on its website.

Meanwhile, the wife of the driver, says she has been forced to call in police after receiving hundreds of email and phone threats after the footage of the attack went viral on the internet showing her business van.

The woman, who does not want to be identified, said there was 'no excuse' for her husband's behaviour and added that he did not work at the business.

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said they were aware of the alleged threats.
