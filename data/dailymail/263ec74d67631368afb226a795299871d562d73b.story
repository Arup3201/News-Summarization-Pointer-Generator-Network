For most people, waking up covered in blood is the stuff of horror films.

But for 22-year-old Stephanie Walker it became a horrifying reality of life.

Miss Walker used to self-harm in her sleep and woke with injuries ranging from small grazes, to gashes which left pools of blood in her bedding.

Stephanie Walker (pictured with her boyfriend Matt Daniels) developed a form of sleepwalking which saw her cut herself in her sleep - it was so bad that she would wake up to find her sheets soaked in blood

She struggled with an unusual and terrifying form of sleepwalking but has recently found relief thanks to a combination of medication and therapy.

She was given sleeping tablets in an attempt to put her into such a deep sleep that she couldn't get up during the night.

When this treatment failed, she was referred for a form of hypnotherapy known as sleep therapy. This treatment has now put an end to her night time injuries.

Miss Walker said: 'I had one-on-one sessions with a sleep therapist and a counsellor. The therapist focused on examining my stress levels and revisiting the memories of self-harming while I was awake when I was younger.

'It scared me to think that my body was reacting in the way it did because I had no conscious outlet for the stress I was feeling. 

'After the sessions with the therapist and the counsellor, I was much more relaxed. At first, I was still harming myself in my sleep, but the injuries became less bad.

'It stopped completely after me and my current boyfriend, Matt, became close again. We were very close friends when I was 16, but I lost contact with him between the ages of 19 and 21.

'It hurt to be apart from him. But since I've been in my current job, and in a stable relationship, I've never felt better.'

Miss Walker (pictured in September 2011 while she was sleepwalking) said she was terrified because she did not know why she kept waking up with cuts on her legs

Miss Walker (pictured with her mother, Lynn) feared she would unintentionally hurt her parents or brother during one of her sleepwalking episodes

Until she received treatment, Miss Walker would use knives to cut her legs while she was asleep.

She said: ‘At first I didn’t know what was going on. I knew no-one could have been coming into my room during the night.

‘The
injuries ranged from little spots and cuts to quite severe marks which 
left a lot of blood on my bed sheets. The only rational explanation was 
that I was doing it to myself. It was extremely scary.’

The frightening night episodes began when Miss Walker was 19, as she struggled emotionally following the breakdown of a relationship.

She was terrified that her inexplicable night time activities would eventually lead her to hurt her mother, Lynn, 52, father, Peter, 54, or brother, Michael, 23.

‘I was able to piece together what was happening - I was getting out of bed and finding sharp objects, like knives, and then hurting myself,’ she said. ‘I must have wandered all around the house looking for cutting tools. But I had no idea I was doing it.’

Miss Walker was eventually referred for a form of hypnotherapy called sleep therapy, which finally put an end to her night time antics

She added: ‘I was always worried I was 
going to hurt my parents. I wouldn’t dream of hurting them, but then I 
didn’t have any control.’

Serious injuries occurred nearly 
every week and soon Miss Walker was anxious that nothing could be done 
to stop her bizarre behaviour.

She
said: ‘It started happening with no warning at all. I had self-harmed 
when I was a younger teenager, but I hadn’t done anything like it for 
years.

Miss Walker has now taken the step of covering the scars on her right leg with a colourful tattoo of Jack and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas

‘I sought help from my mum almost 
straight away. I’d gone to her when I hurt myself when I was younger, so
I thought of seeking help from her first.

‘She was so supportive. She came to every single appointment with me, and every therapy session.

‘At first the doctors thought I was 
doing it to myself while I was awake. They sent me to counselling and 
analysed me, and put me on strong sleeping tablets which they thought 
would knock me out to the extent that I wouldn’t be able to move when I 
was asleep.

‘But they didn’t work. I became more and more stressed.

‘I kept nagging the doctors for help. They sent me for sleep therapy - a form of hypnotism - which began to make a difference. As the injuries became less severe, I breathed a big sigh of relief.’

Miss Walker, from Leeds, has not experienced any such injuries for a year. This week she moved into her own flat, confident her nocturnal self-harming has gone for good.

Having completed her therapy treatment, she is being supported through her recovery by her boyfriend Matt Daniels, 23. 

Miss Walker said: ‘I feel freed from my behaviour, as if I’m able to move on with my life.’

She has even taken the step of covering the scars on her right leg with a colourful tattoo.

She said: ‘You can’t see the scars on my legs any more. Most of them have been covered by a tattoo of Jack and Sally from The Nightmare Before Christmas - it’s one of my favourite films.’
