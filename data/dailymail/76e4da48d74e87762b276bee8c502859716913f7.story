However the ex-athlete insisted they take it and the woman claim they blacked out shortly after. 

The report obtained by the LA Times read: 'The [victim] was under the impression that they were going to be going to an after-party. So, the [victim] went to use the restroom and does not recall anything after that.'

Another friend, who had passed out in the hotel living room having also taken some of the drink, then knocked on the door prompting Sharper to shout 'Hold On', the Times reported.

The five-time Pro-Bowl started then got off and the victim got dressed and left.

A similar report states how a woman met Sharper at a party in the Hollywood Hills on January 15, 2014. 

She told detectives the athlete, who played in the NFL for 14 seasons, offered to share a taxi with her to an after party.

However he insisted they stop off at his hotel beforehand so he could 'pick something up'.

The women told Sharper they didn't want a drink - but he insisted.

The victim then became suspicious as it 'didn't taste like normal vodka shots'. 

After 10 minutes of drinking, the pair allegedly blacked out and woke up the following morning on a pull-out bed in the hotel room.

Documents seen by the Times said one of the women felt a 'pain in her vagina' while the other could not 'remember anything' from the night before. 

Less than a month after the second case, Los Angeles County prosecutors charged Sharper.

After posting £1million bail and walking from jail, he was back in custody after turning himself in on February 27, when a warrant for his arrest was issued in New Orleans.

He was indicted with co-defendant Brandon Licciardi and a third man on three rape charges.  

A judge in Los Angeles then ordered he be kept in custody, and has remained there since February 2014.

Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, the Minnesota Vikings and the New Orleans Saints.

He won the NFC Championship twice - with the Packers in 1997 and Saints in 2009.
