Sex is so last year - or at least it is according to Amazon's annual list of bestselling books.

A year after the S&M-themed Fifty Shades Of Grey by EL James overwhelmed best-seller lists, book buyers have been seeking different kinds of thrills.

Dan Brown's latest Robert Langdon caper Inferno - the fourth in the series made famous by the Da Vinci Code - was Amazon.com's No. 1 seller for 2013, the online retailer announced yesterday.

Khaled Hosseini was second with And The Mountains Echoed, while the best-sellers for kids and teenagers were Veronica Roth's Allegiant and Rick Riordan's The Houses of Hades.

Other major hits on Amazon.com were The Cuckoo's Calling, a crime story JK Rowling wrote under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, and John Grisham's Sycamore Row.

Sylvia Day's Entwined With You was one of the few works of erotic fiction to place high on Amazon's list.

Nonfiction favorites included Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In and Things That Matter, an anthology of essays by conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer.
