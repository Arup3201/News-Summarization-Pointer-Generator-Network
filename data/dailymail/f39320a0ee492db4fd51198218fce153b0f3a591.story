Rev Nathan Ntege greets the congregation outside St Jude's in Thornton Heath following the collapse of the trial 

Only a few days ago, he was in the dock in a Crown Court trial, facing the prospect of years in jail for allegedly overseeing a ‘conveyor belt’ of fake weddings.

But yesterday the Rev Nathan Ntege, 54, was back in the pulpit at his Church of England parish and smiling broadly.

He was even blessed in front of the congregation by his bishop, despite being accused of running Britain’s biggest bogus marriage racket in a £1million trial that collapsed last week.

The Ugandan vicar said little about his legal difficulties yesterday, except to inform the parishioners that after three years of being suspended from work, he and his wife Elizabeth, 49, and four children are to take a month-long holiday – to Uganda.

Given that he was granted asylum in Britain after complaining of persecution in his homeland, it is a surprising destination. Yet no more surprising than his triumphant return to his South London church.

Mr Ntege was accused of herding almost 500 couples up the aisle in just 15 months in a bid to make money for himself and give numerous Africans the right to stay in the country. 

But the case was suddenly ‘stayed’ last Wednesday when the judge accused UK Border Agency staff involved in the prosecution of lying and concealing key evidence.

Numerous questions still remain over the vicar, however.

Weddings at St Jude’s in Thornton Heath rocketed from six a year to up to nine a day after he took over. 

Brides and grooms were often virtual strangers to each other, with ill-fitting wedding dresses being shared and swapped in the lavatories. 

He had also been accused of siphoning off £70,000 in wedding fees to himself, and back to Uganda, rather than to his diocese.

And the Daily Mail has learnt that he arrived in London in 1996 after ‘abandoning’ his Church of Uganda flock in the capital Kampala, and that his Ugandan bishop did not believe he deserved asylum in Britain.

None of these tough questions was answered yesterday. Instead, as 100 parishioners sat in the church, Bishop of Croydon Jonathan Clark delivered a service full of praise for Mr Ntege – as the controversial vicar stood smiling beside him, clad in clerical robes.

The bishop said he wanted to ‘commend Nathan and his family to your prayers and love’, and added: ‘Just as in these last few years of difficult times you have continued to worship God and to serve him, through this next period of transition I ask if you will continue to focus not on whatever happened or didn’t happen in court, not on the UK Border Agency, not on other people in the church or in your community, but to focus on God and God’s love. Look forward, not back, set aside recrimination and blame.’

He then complied with a request from Mr Ntege and his family for a blessing – during which they knelt in front of him.

And the bishop clarified that he did not need to formally restore Mr Ntege to his post, saying that it happened automatically when the court case collapsed. 

Outside the church, Bishop Clark refused to say whether he had any concerns about the explosion in weddings under Mr Ntege, or about the claims that £70,000 of funds due to the diocese had gone missing.

Speaking in the service, Mr Ntege said: ‘I want to thank you brothers and sisters for praying for us. Thank you for your support. I’m not doing any interviews. God bless you.’

Approached outside and at the huge three-storey Victorian vicarage he shares with his family – where they remained throughout his three-year suspension on full pay – Mr Ntege refused to answer any further questions.

But some of the vicar’s parishioners are standing behind him.

Social worker Richard Mukasa, 35, originally from Uganda like many of the congregation, said he used to live close to the church – and despite moving to Birmingham had returned for yesterday’s service.

Mr Mukasa said: ‘Before the Rev Ntege came here, this church was dead. When they talk about the number of weddings, why don’t they talk about the number of funerals and baptisms? 

'They went up as well. What is the point of people coming to church when they are cohabiting, when they are fornicating? The church is there to wed people.’
