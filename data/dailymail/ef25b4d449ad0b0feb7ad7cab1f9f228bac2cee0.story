A 25-year-old former child-molestation victim from Oregon was spared prison time after she admitted to sexually abusing her mentally disabled underage brother and having a baby with him.

The Portland woman, who is not being named to protect the identity of her sibling, pleaded guilty last week to one count of second-degree sexual abuse in connection to her year-long incestuous affair with her own brother.

Investigators said the brother and sister had sex 10 times between 2013 and 2014 while they lived together, resulting in the woman's pregnancy.

Leniency: An Oregon judge (not pictured) has sentenced a 25-year-old former childhood-molestation victim to three years' probation for having a baby with her mentally disabled teenage brother 

The victim was younger than 18 at the time of the abuse. He has an IQ of 54, according to a probable cause affidavit cited by The Oregonian. 

Court documents presented during a hearing last Wednesday revealed that the 25-year-old woman was raped by her mother's boyfriend from the time she was 8 until age 11.

Her tormentor was later convicted of child sex abuse and is currently serving a 20-year sentence.

In court last week, the 25-year-old told Judge Kenneth Walker she has had a difficult family life involving both physical and verbal abuse, and that she suffers from depression and anxiety.

At the time of her arrest last August, the woman was working part-time at the Portland Habilitaiton Center - a non-profit organization that provides education, training, employment and housing for people with disabilities in Oregon and Washington state.

As part of a plea deal, the woman was sentenced to three years’ probation, ordered to register as a sex offender and banned from making contact with her brother and all other underage males.

The woman's special-needs sibling is currently living with his mother. There is no word on who is raising the siblings' baby.
