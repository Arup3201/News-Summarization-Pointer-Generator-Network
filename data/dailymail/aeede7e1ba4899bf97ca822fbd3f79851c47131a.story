The family of an Illinois woman reported missing with her two young children seven days ago are breathing a huge sigh of relief after police found all three alive and safe 150 miles away in Wisconsin yesterday.

Aneta Marsek and her daughters were reported missing by her estranged husband after family members had been unable to reach her since the previous Saturday evening.

Police located Ms Marsek, 33 and her two daughters, Chevelle, 2, and Macenzie, four months, after the mother asked a garage attendant in Wisconsin Dells to call the police and let them know they were alive and living in her SUV.

Found: Aneta Marsek and her daughters Macenzie, four months, and Chevelle, 2, had been missing for seven days before police found them parked in Wisconsin Dells where they had been living in the car

The Volo mother told Lake County 
Sheriff's department that she 'needed to get away' and that she many 
'childhood memories' of the Wisconsin Dells area.

The trio were found living in Ms 
Marsek's Chevrolet Trailblazer in a 'secluded wooded area' near County 
Road H and Fitzgerald Road.

Karen Kates of the Lake County 
Sheriff's office told MailOnline that despite the long period of time 
away from home with an infant, Ms Marsek ' had supplies to care for the 
baby.'

Before their return home, the mother and her two children had last seen leaving her parents' Wauconda home at around 7pm Saturday night though police now say she didn't leave for Wisconsin until Monday.

Police cordoned off the family home 
in the nearby village of Volo. A CSI van was parked in the driveway and 
investigators were seen moving in and out of the house with equipment.

Days ago, family friend Kelly Lizzo told Chicago's WGNTV: 'We're worried about her. We're worried about the kids. 

'We
don't know what happened. We don't know where she is, and of course, 
not knowing, anything and everything is going through your head.'

Police issued an 'endangered missing person' notice and distributed 9,000 posters appealing to the public for help.

Memories: Ms Marsek and her daughters were living in her car in a secluded area of Wisconsin Dells near County Road H and Fitzgerald Road

Home: The trio had been living in a similar Chevrolet Trailblazer in which Lake County Sheriff's office says the mother packed enough supplies to care for the baby

On Saturday night, losing hope for the 
safe return of Ms Marsek and her daughters, nearly 100 people turned out
to a vigil held by the family.

Found safe and sound, all three were taken to St. Clair Hospital in Baraboo, Wisconsin to be examined.

Described by police as being in 'good health' the two little girls were released into the custody of their father, Dan Marsek, while Aneta Marsek was transported to the Winnebago Mental Health Facility in Oshkosh, Wisconsin for further examination.

Karen Kates confirmed that the case had now been turned over to Lake County state's attorney's office to review.

Praying: Around 100 people attended a vigil for the missing mother and her two babies when she showed no signs of turning up last week
