The man who allegedly lied to secure a $400,000-a-year position with Myer is now being accused of also using fake CVs to con his way into four other lucrative jobs.

American businessman Andrew Flanagan is accused of falsifying his credentials to secure a senior role with Myer in June this year.

On Monday, Flanagan fronted Melbourne Magistrates’ Court for a committal mention hearing, facing nine fraud charges. 

The court was told that Flanagan organised friends to pose as former employers, supplying Myer recruitment firm Quest International with fake references, numbers and email addresses.

Mr Flanagan was fired by Myer on his first day when suspicions were raised that the 36-year-old had conned his way into his high-level job.

Andrew Flanagan is accused of lying about his employment history to gain employment with five different companies, including a senior role with Myer in June this year

The court was told that Flanagan has lied about his experience to gain employment with four other companies since 2011.

It's alleged by the Prosecution that Flanagan was paid more than $170,000 whilst working in the roles, according to Herald Sun.

Flanagan is also facing charges of 'obtaining financial advantage by deception and theft' through his dishonest conduct.

According to claims in court documents filed during the hearing today, Flanagan secured four other lucrative, high-level positions.

Flanagan is accused of acquiring a $350,000-a-year job with Speciality Fashion Group by providing a fake CV, according to the court documents.

It's alleged the company paid Flanagan more than $106,000 whilst he worked as their Chief Operating Officer between February and April this year.

The businessman was also allegedly hired as CEO for the Australian Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry from November 2013 to February of this year.

The 46-year-old is being charged with obtaining more than $32,000 from the company, as well as stealing a laptop.

To secure the role with Myer, it is alleged Mr Flanagan claimed to have held several ‘senior executive business positions’ including roles with international retail chain Zara and UK company Tesco

In 2012, Flanagan worked as a casual lecturer at the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE by allegedly lying about his previous experience, a court heard.

He is being accused of fraudulently obtaining $20,000 from the TAFE.

According to court documents, in 2011, he reportedly fabricated his employment history to attain a $180,000-a-year executive role with Bendigo Health.

The company paid him $10,000, according to the court documents.

Mr Flanagan faces four charges of obtaining property by deception and two charges of making a false document.

He is also accused of obtaining a financial advantage by deception and attempting obtain property by deception and theft.

Andrew Flanagan’s allegedly dishonest behaviour was exposed when he was appointed Myer’s group general manager of strategic and business development in June this year, a court heard.

The Crown told the court that at the time Myer sent a media release about their new employee, citing Flanagan’s impressive background in business.

Flanagan claimed to have held several ‘senior executive business positions’ including roles with International retail chain Zara and UK company Tesco.

Myer was allegedly informed by corporation Inditex, the Spanish owners of Zara, that Flanagan had never held a position with the company, the court heard.

Mr Flanagan's defence lawyer Rowan Slattery told a committal mention hearing on Monday he disputed some of the witness evidence and added there were issues around whether a falsity in a resume constituted the alleged deception.

But Magistrate Charles Rozencwajg said: "If he handed up references and they were false, that's really what the charge is all about."

Mr Rozencwajg said the issue went "south" after Myer announced Flanagan's appointment in the media and the alleged deception became known and Flanagan was not performing as well as someone with his credentials was expected to.

Flanagan's bail was extended until December 15 for a one-day committal hearing in the Melbourne Magistrates Court.
