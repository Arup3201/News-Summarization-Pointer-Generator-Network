One extraordinarily lucky Massachusetts man took home $780,000 after winning the lottery twice in the same drawing.

Kenneth J. Strokes, of Norwood, Mass., had his name pulled twice in the state's Lucky for Life lottery.

The prize: $25,000 a year for life.

ABC 7 reports that shortly after lotto officials called to tell him he had a winning ticket, he remembered that his family had bought him another lottery ticket.

When he found it, the second ticket had the same numbers as the winning one, which used his family's birthdays.

'For a game like this, where there's so many possible winning combinations..people rarely buy the same ticket with the same numbers...they have to be really confident that those numbers will come in,' said lottery spokesperson Christian Teja in an interview with The Boston Globe.

Teja said Stokes was 'excited as most people are when they win a prize of this magnitude.'

Strokes asked to be given the total lump sum of each winning, which comes to $39,000 per ticket.

He says he'll use the money to cover his son's college education, pay off his daughter's car, then take his family on vacation.
