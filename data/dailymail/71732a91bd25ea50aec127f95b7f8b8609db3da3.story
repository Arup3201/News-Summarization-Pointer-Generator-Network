Donal Drohan from Harrow who died after a tree fell on his car on his way to work last year

A father-of-three was crushed to death under a rotting tree that was never inspected due to confusion at a council over who was responsible for it.

Donal Drohan, 51, was driving to work when the 40ft Lombardy poplar tree snapped in the St Jude storm that lashed Britain last winter.

Bystanders rushed to help as the trunk fell on his car but it is thought he died instantly.

An inquest yesterday heard the tree was on land owned by Hertfordshire County Council. But its position meant it was unclear whether its highways department or a contractor was responsible for maintaining it. As a result, it had not been subjected to regular safety inspections. Fungal decay was found only after it had come down.

Tree expert Arthur Clarke told the hearing the decay could have weakened the tree.

Mr Drohan was one of four people who died when winds up to 100mph tore through the country. There was extensive damage to building and power lines as well as travel chaos.

The operations manager for Harrow Council, north-west London, was driving through Watford at 6.50am on October 28 when the tree sheared 10ft from the ground and crashed down on to his Peugeot 207.

PC Rob Jackson viewed CCTV footage of the incident and told the inquest in Hatfield it had happened ‘very quickly’.

Shop workers from a nearby DIY store and other motorists battled to free Mr Drohan but were unable to move the tree. A fire crew cut the trunk away but Mr Drohan had fatal head and spine injuries.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Hertfordshire senior coroner Edward Thomas said he 'could not imagine how difficult this has been for the family.'

The inquest heard that maintaining and inspecting trees on highways was the responsibility of Hertfordshire County Council and agencies they employed to do the job.

However, Peter Simpson, senior asset manager at the council, said of the tree: 'Our records show it does not form part of the public highway.

'There are parcels of land that may be adjacent to the highway but according to our records do not form part of the public highway and therefore would not come under the regime of safety inspections.

'We have since determined that it is land owned by Hertfordshire County Council but not designated as public highway.'

Mr Simpson said if they had known who owned the tree it would have been inspected by the council's property section and admitted it had 'slipped the net.'

Addressing the family, Mr Thomas said of Mr Drohan: "He was healthy, he was a good family man, working hard, enjoying his family life. '

'The sudden and awfulness of this is unimaginable.

'There's nothing I can say that can make that any better, but I just want to acknowledge how awful this must be for you.

A council spokesman said: ‘This was a tragic accident and we’d like to pass on our sympathies to Mr Dohan’s family.’ Coroner Edward Thomas gave a verdict of accidental death.

Mr Drohan's family declined to comment following the inquest.
