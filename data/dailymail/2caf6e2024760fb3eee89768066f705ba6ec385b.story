Prison officials are searching for a 49-year-old escaped inmate who fled the Oak Glen Camp in San Bernadino County.

James Murray, an inmate firefighter, was last observed on Friday night in his dorm room in Yuicaipa, reports NBC.

Murray is white, has short brown hair, and stands 5 feet 9 inches tall.

James Murray, 49, escaped from Oak Glen Camp in San Bernadino County yesterday and authorities are still attempting to capture him

Murray was imprisoned for second-degree burglary and has been in prison since Oct 25, 2012, said the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

The Mail Online spoke with Sgt. F. Martinez who said that they have not yet captured Murray but have been adamantly searching for him.

They had a dog team scout for Murray's scent which they followed to a nearby highway leading them to believe that Murray may have entered a vehicle and drove off.

They also had a helicopter circle the area to look for additional clues.

Martinez said that as of 12:45 today they suspended the foot search for Murray and will work with undercover agents who monitor phone calls or any possible contact with friends or family members.

Inmate firefighters like Murray fight wild land fire along with non incarcerated firefighters as part of Oak Glen's fire crews and program aimed at lowering prison recidivism rates. Each crew consists of 16 inmates and one inmate fire captain.

Once inmates are legally released back into society many go on to continue the profession they have been trained in while they were prisoners.

Authorities are asking anyone with information to call the Oak Glen Conservation Camp Commander at (909) 797-0196.
