Former Government Chief Whip Philip Ruddock has hit back at Tony Abbott's decision to sack him, saying he would have expected the Prime Minister to raise concerns about his job performance.

Mr Ruddock, dubbed the Father of the House because he is the longest serving MP in Parliament, was stood down on Friday, days after a failed leadership challenge to Mr Abbott.  

Mr Ruddock, who had held the position since September 2013, was guarded with his comments on the reasons for his sacking but denied he was  a 'scapegoat' for the government's woes.

'The position I held is one that the leader chooses, and I have no complaint about that,' Mr Ruddock told Sky News on Sunday.

'My expectation is if the Prime Minister has concerns about how I undertook the task, he would put them to me.'

But Mr Abbott has defended his decision to sack Mr Ruddock, saying he should have been more aware of the concerns of backbenchers and seen off any possible leadership issue before it reached the spill motion, which was held last Monday. 

'I wasn't as aware as I should have been on all of this, I never want to find myself in this position ever again,' Mr Abbott told Network Ten on Sunday.

'I'm confident that with the whip's team that we've got, I will be very much aware of what's going on inside the party.' 

Mr Ruddock has been replaced by Queensland MP Scott Buchholz, who was very vocal in his support of Mr Abbott in the days before the spill motion.

Mr Ruddock is the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives, as he first elected to for the seat of Parramatta at by-election in 1973 

The Prime Minister caused outrage among his MPs, with whom he had promised to be more consultative, when he dumped Mr Ruddock on Friday without prior warning, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

However, Mr Ruddock denied the claims that his demotion was affected after he failed to rally ahead of the spill motion.

'To be a barracker rather than refusing to comment was in my view not the appropriate way forward,' Mr Ruddock said.

'The Prime Minister had my support, and I did what I believe was the appropriate role. I did what I believe was the appropriate role and I don't intend to comment further.

'The decision I held is the Prime Minister's choice and if he had any concerns, I would expect him to raise them with me.'

Some even went as far as describing Mr Abbott's decision as 'scapegoating of Godzilla proportions' amid claims the move was Mr Ruddock's punishment for not seeing off the leadership challenge, the ABC said. 

Mr Ruddock is the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives and he was first elected to the Sydney seat of Parramatta at a by-election in 1973. 

He went on to hold many titles, including the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs from 1996 to 2003 during John Howard's time in office. He was also Attorney General between 2003 and 2007. He was appointed Chief Whipe in September 2013, soon after Mr Abbott was elected PM. 

Queensland backbencher Andrew Laming publicly expressed his disapproval for Mr Abbott's decision, saying it was 'scapegoating of Godzilla proportions'.

'We really needed a week of healing, not wounding, and I think it really has set us back a fair bit particularly because Philip Ruddock was such a respected character,' Mr Laming told the ABC.

One backbencher, who has not been named, described Mr Abbott's decision on Friday afternoon as 'another disastrous call', the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'The PM had my vote on Monday even though he refused to get rid of Peta Credlin [the chief of staff],' another MP told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'He has now lost my vote because he had no right to get rid of Philip Ruddock.' 

Others told The Australian that Mr Abbott felt Mr Ruddock had not been supportive enough of the Prime Minister.

Mr Abbott however denied such claims, saying his decision was based on having 'a deeper and stronger engagement with the backbench and that means it was very important to renew and refresh the whips team'.

Mr Abbott's move to dump his chief whip on Friday not only angered his backbench but also risks the questioning of his leadership once again

In a statement released on Friday, Mr Abbott did not offer any reasoning behind his decision and instead thanked Mr Ruddock for his contribution.

'As Father of the House, Philip has given over four decades of service to the Australian Parliament and the Australian people. He was a senior minister throughout the life of the Howard government and was shadow cabinet secretary in opposition. Later this year, he will become the second longest serving parliamentarian in our history. No one has done more than Philip helping immigrants to feel at home in their new country and helping members of migrant communities to participate in our national life,' the prime minister said.

'I look forward to his future contribution to the government and to our country. He remains an important counsellor for Coalition members of parliament and will continue to serve as Member for Berowra with distinction.

'These changes will be in place for the next parliamentary sitting period.' 

The announcement the spill was to be held last Monday was made the day before, just after Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull praised Mr Abbott for holding the ballot on Tuesday to give his colleagues time to discuss the matter on Monday before casting their vote.

The Prime Minister held onto his leadership after 61 MPs voted against a spill motion and 39 for it.
