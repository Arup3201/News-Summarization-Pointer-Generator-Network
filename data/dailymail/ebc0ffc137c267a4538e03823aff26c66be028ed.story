A small aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing on a snowy highway in New Jersey this afternoon due to a suspected mechanical failure.

Christopher Okechukwu, 51, a doctor and father-of-three from Paramus, was traveling solo to Lincoln Park Airport when the incident occurred.

Despite icy conditions, the pilot of 15 years managed to make a safe landing on the tarmac below and no injuries were reported. 

He decided to go with the flow of traffic and touched down on a clear stretch of road behind a truck and car.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Okechukwu's Cessna C150 - built in 1976 - landed on Route 23 in West Milford. 

He took the decision to dock it after he heard a 'sputtering' noise in flight. 

No vehicles were hit by the plane and the aircraft did not appear to sustain any major damage. 

It landed around 1pm and was removed from the highway via a flatbed truck around 2:30pm.

All lanes are now reopened. 

One driver, Andrew May, told WABC-TV that the pilot glided to the highway and it was a 'miracle' he didn't crash into signs or overhanging wires. 

He added: 'The plane just came up, and it almost felt like the plane hit us. That's how close it was. Thank God it didn't.' 

Okechukwu's wife Susan told The Record that he is an emergency room physician at Newton Memorial Hospital in Sussex County so is used to handling stressful situations,

She said he appeared to be 'fine' and a 'bit shaken' after talking with him on the phone earlier today.

The Federal Aviation Administration said it will investigate the cause of the incident.
