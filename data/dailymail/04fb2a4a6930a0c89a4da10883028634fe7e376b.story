Forget Toddlers & Tiaras: Married career women in their 30s and 40s are the latest stars of the pageant world.

Game of Crowns, a new reality series that premieres Sunday on Bravo, follows six wives with families who vie for beauty queen status on the 'Mrs' circuit.

Cast members, including a lawyer, entrepreneur and pilot, are seen honing their interviewing skills and dishing on past plastic surgeries as they prepare to compete.

'Of course, I get Botox,' exclaims Vanassa Sebastian, a registered nurse from Connecticut, in one clip.

In another preview, the women debate the merits of butt glue, defined by Susanna Paliotta as 'basically any type of substance that you can glue your bathing suit down to your butt.'

Mrs Paliotta, who owns a children's clothing brand, is also seen learning to 'speak eloquent' for the interview portion of the competitions.

The women say they spend thousands of dollars on coaching, makeup and other expenses.

'From losing 70 pounds with personal trainers and nutritionists, to gown shopping and hair extensions and teeth whitening and eyelash extensions, there’s so much that goes into it — about $10,000,' Leha Guilmette, a technical recruiter from Rhode Island, tells the New York Post.

'It’s like making a choice to do any hobby,' Lynne Diamante, a former Mrs Rhode Island USA and attorney, says.

She adds: 'Some women go away for spa weekends, we compete against each other in pageants.'
