The number of birds and hedgehogs in the UK has fallen dramatically as a result of climate change and extreme weather, according to a new report.

The hedgehog population has dropped from 36million in 1950 to just one million today meaning the species is facing the same rapid decline as the tiger.

During the last 50 years numbers of birds have also fallen by 44million. 

Warmer winters have affected species including hedgehogs and dormice, causing them to come out of hibernation at the wrong time of year.

Populations of wildfowl birds including Berwick’s swans, which winter in the UK, have also declined, while the Peak District’s golden plover is vulnerable as warmer conditions reduce the crane flies available for chicks to feed on.

Thousands of puffins starved to death this year after the coldest March on record for 50 years. A new report by Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) has drawn together the latest evidence to provide information on the impact of climate change on the countryside now and in the future.

Many spring events, from frog spawning to leaves appearing on trees, bird eggs hatching and flowers blossoming are happening earlier, with the danger that the life-cycles of dependent species are becoming out of sync, the ‘terrestrial biodiversity climate change impacts report card’ drawn up for the government said.

The report also revealed many dragonflies, butterflies and woodlice are moving their ranges north, while new species of insect have colonised the UK from Europe.

And mountain plants which are adapted to colder conditions are at risk from a warming climate, as warmth-loving species colonise their habitats in response to higher temperatures.

But higher winter temperatures in the past two decades have contributed to higher survival rates among some breeding bird species, the report card said.

Climate change is also responsible for new pests and diseases which are having a major impact on the UK’s trees.

Trees are being hit by dangers such as the oak processionary moth, which can cause breathing problems in people.

And the UK’s climate will become more suitable to invasive pests and diseases, including those which have an impact on a wide range of native plant species, the report said. 

Dr Mike Morecroft, from Natural England, who led the development of the overview, said: ‘This report card shows strong evidence from a large number of different scientific studies that the natural world has started to respond to climate change over the last few decades.

‘It also shows the range and complexity of these changes: some species and habitats are much more sensitive than others.

‘This is a challenge for conservation and we need to adapt our approach to reduce the risks and take advantage of any opportunities. 

‘It is also another wake-up call about the seriousness of tackling climate change.’
