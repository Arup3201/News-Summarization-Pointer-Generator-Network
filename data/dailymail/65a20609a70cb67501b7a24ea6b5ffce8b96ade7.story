An accused serial molesting tattoo artist is facing 150 years behind bars for trying to force a 17-year-old to have sex with her mother's boyfriend and allegedly committing nearly 200 other sex crimes against children as young as four.

Walter Meyerle, 35, of Falls Township, Pennsylvania, is on trial for the catalogue of twisted abuse, allegedly committed against 15 children from 1998 to 2011.

Evidence presented in court on Thursday accuses the man of trying to make the unnamed Croydon 17-year-old take photos of classmates in her school locker room as well as threatening to send her mother nude photos he had made her take of herself if she didn't do as he said.

One of the photos presented in Bucks County Court, on the fourth day of the trial, showed the teen topless, with her nine-year-old sister touching her breasts, according to Philly.com.

'Payback is a bitch,' Meyerle told the teenager in exchanges read out by Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Schorn, after she refused to tease and have sex with her mother’s boyfriend.

'Now you will have no friends when they see what you did with kids,' he told her.

The man is also facing child pornography charges and his expansive collection cleared the courtroom on Thursday, according to Phillyburbs.com.

Approximately 50 videos and 30 photos 
were found on Meyerle's computers and cell phone following his arrest 
last year, and included images of 'rapes of children, children with 
adults, children with children, children with animals,' Bucks County 
Judge Gibbons said.

Some of the movies involved very young children crying and saying 'no,no' during sex acts.

The 17-year-old Benjamin Franklin Freshman Academy student said she was introduced to Meyerle in 2010 by a friend who was also abused and a series of text messages from February and March 2011 suggest the pair were an item.

Most of the exchanges involved phone sex, with the tattoo artist dictating the sexual favours he wanted performed, according to Philly.com.

Meyerle also convinced the teen to send him naked photos of herself, which he used to blackmail her when she refused to do as she was told.

He initially talked the girl into sending photos of her wearing a bra and knickers, and then to 'lose the bra,' because he could get her a job modeling bikinis, according to Philly.com.

He also had the minor hold up a sign saying, 'Hi Steve,' and he sent those photos to a friend, detective and phone records show.

When the student refused to take photos of girls in the locker room at the Bristol Township school, he said he was 'done' with her and threatened to send the nude pictures to her friends and her mother.

'That’s the last time you tell me 'no,'' he said in one exchange, according to the news website.

In other texts, the man told the teenager: 'You are every guy's fantasy -- getting with a daughter with a hot-ass body.'

Meyerle found several of his victims by dating their mothers and offering the children tattoos in exchange for sex, according to reports.

His alleged victims include boys and girls, some as young as four years old.

The man has been in Bucks County Prison's restricted housing unit on $5 million bail since his arrest last March. He attempted to break out of prison last year.
