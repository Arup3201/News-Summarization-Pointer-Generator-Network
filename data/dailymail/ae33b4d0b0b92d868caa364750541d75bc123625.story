An ultrafast internet service able to download an entire music album in just four seconds is launched today as a new front is opened in Britain’s pay TV and broadband war.

The 152Mb service from Virgin Media, who use sprint star Usain Bolt as brand ambassador, is some 23 times faster than the service available over the old copper telephone wires.

As a result it can download a high definition movie in four minutes, rather than up to 90 minutes, which it can take some households.

Slow internet speeds can slash the value of a home as broadband becomes more of a necessity

Welcoming: The arrival of ultrafast broadband was welcomed by Culture Secretary, Maria Miller

The arrival of ultrafast broadband was welcomed by Culture Secretary, Maria Miller, who said: ‘Families are now downloading films, streaming music and playing games through phones, laptops, tablets and consoles.  

‘Higher speeds will enable the whole family to use the internet at the same time.’

Virgin is using free speed upgrades as its key weapon in a fierce battle for customers with BT, Sky, TalkTalk and others.

The high speeds are made possible because Virgin has its own growing spiders web of fibre optic cables that crisscross the country.

BT, which is rolling out its own fibre cables, is focussing on building its reputation as a pay TV broadcaster, mainly through buying up high profile sport, including Premier League Football, the Champions League and rugby.

It is using the appeal of these channels, plus new HD offerings from Discovery, TLC, Animal Planet, and Eurosport, as a lever to get people to sign up for its premium broadband services.

While Sky already holds a vast roster of high profile sports and film channels which are used to tempt customers to buy its broadband services.

Virgin claims to have the fastest broadband network, however the huge popularity of these services means it still slows down at peak evening times.

Peak internet use by its customers has grown 55 per cent in the past year and by almost 1,000per cent  since the company’s launch in 2007.

Customers who currently pay £15.50 a month for its 30Mb service will get a free upgrade to 50Mb. Line rental takes the cost up by another £15.99 a month.

Those who pay £20.50 a month for 60Mb will be moved up to 100MB, and those who pay £28 for 100 or 120Mb will be moved up to 152Mb.

While the speed upgrades are free, Virgin customers who want the fastest service will still be paying a substantial £527.88 a year including line rental.

The upgrades will begin this month in areas such as Aldershot, Maidstone, Colchester, Leicester, and Glenrothes, Scotland, before being rolled out to other customers over the next 12 months.

Chief executive Tom Mockridge said: ‘We’re supercharging our incredible network to ensure customers can make the most of the online world. Overwhelmingly people tell us the internet is a force for good. From daily life to the bigger aspects of society, culture and economic growth, digital is making a significant, positive difference to people’s lives.’

The launch of the high speed services comes at the same time as the company is revealing a new system of parental controls – Web Safe - to block pornography and other adult material.

The free service allows the account holder to restrict access to types of potentially age-inappropriate websites. It works across all devices connected to the family’s home internet service.

All new customers will be asked if they want Web Safe turned on when the service is activated. Existing customers will get pop-up messages when they log on asking if want to install the safeguards.
