Under pressure: BBC Director General George Entwistle admitted he knew nothing about the corporation broadcasting child sex abuse allegations before they went out

BBC insiders have called the Director General's claim that he didn't ask about the content of the canned Jimmy Savile Newsnight documentary 'barely credible' and 'ridiculous'.

At a press conference on Friday, George Entwistle, who expressed his 'revulsion' at the thought of Savile's abuse at the BBC, claimed he never asked questions about the nature of the Newsnight investigation dropped last year, saying he wanted to ensure the independence of news and current affairs.

At the time Mr Entwistle was Director of the Vision division, which is responsible for commissioning, producing, scheduling and broadcasting the content of all of the BBC's television channels.

The Independent reported that media commentator Steve Hewlett, who presents Radio 4's The Media Show, yesterday called the claim 'simply implausible', adding: 'The idea that he didn't know is barely credible.'

David Elstein, the former chief executive of Channel 5, added his voice to the condemnation, saying Entwhistle would have to be 'pretty brain dead' not to investigate the programme's subject matter.

Mr Entwistle, who also apologised to victims on behalf of the BBC, told reporters that Helen Boaden (head of news) had told him that Newsnight was planning a programme about Savile. He said that he said 'thanks for letting me know', but asked no questions about it.

A senior BBC newsroom source told the Independent: 'It defies credibility that he didn't try to find this out.

'The idea that, as head of vision, in charge of the Christmas schedule, he just said 'thanks for letting me know' is ridiculous.

'The best thing you can say is he looks completely incurious to the point of being irresponsible. He looks hopeless.'

Tension: A source says BBC director general's comments have split the Newsnight newsroom

The source added that Newsnight journalists are 'extremely tense' and feel like they were left 'looking stupid' by Mr Entwhistle's comments.

'You have a huge national story that was not mentioned on Newsnight until 10 or 11 days after it blew up. (The newsroom) is getting uncomfortable. It is very tense. It is a ludicrous situation,' they added.

The source also spoke about the claim of Peter Rippon, the editor who dropped the Savile investigation, that the story was not good enough to air. They added: 'He did everything he could to make it impossible for the story to run... In most newsrooms if you are not quite there (with a story) you would just keep going.'

The paper added that it understands the Newsnight team had spoken to at least 10 women, including witnesses and victims.

A BBC spokesperson said: 'George Entwistle has made his position exceptionally clear. As said at the press briefing on Friday, 'I was the Director of Vision for the television department at the BBC, I had no influence or authority over investigations carried out by BBC News and it's very important that I always behaved in a manner which absolutely bore out that lack of authority or responsibility'.'

Sorry: Entwistle also apologised to victims on behalf of the BBC and says he feels 'revulsion' that the attacks may have taken place at the BBC

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
