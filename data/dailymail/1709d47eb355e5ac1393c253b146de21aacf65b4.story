With the nights drawing in, the relentless rain and the gloomy skies, Seasonal Affective Disorder sufferers are dreading the impending months of Autumn and Winter.

But the Met Office has plans to blow the clouds away, with a service that will warn sufferers that bad weather is on the way.

SAD is a type of winter depression that affects an estimated 7 per cent of the UK population every winter between September and April, in particular during December, January and February.

With the miserable weather set to be a daily feature for the next few months, the MET is inventing ways to help sufferers beat the 'winter blues'

The UK has been battered by bad weather this year, with rain lashing the country and storms causing chaos

The national forecaster's 'Brighter Outlook' scheme alerts SAD patients via email, voicemail or text, that the clouds are rolling in and that they should use light boxes to cheer themselves up.

It combines miserable weather alerts issued 
by the Met Office with light therapy and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy 
(CBT) self-help material to help people.

'Light lounges' can help beat the blues of those who struggle to survive the wintery months

They said their scheme is a preventative service, aimed at helping people with SAD to manage their condition by warning them of periods of increased risk to their health and providing them with treatments to manage their condition.

Brighter Outlook was piloted in 
Cornwall from February to the end of April 2009. The Met Office, Outlook
South West and the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Primary Care Trust 
worked together to provide the service.

Everyone enrolled on the service was 
provided with a light box and a self-help booklet that included some 
tried and tested self-help strategies.

These ideas were based on Cognitive 
Behaviour Therapy and provided common-sense approaches to managing the 
symptoms of winter depression.

When gloomy weather was forecast, the Met Office provided alerts to people enrolled on the scheme.

Participants chose to receive the alert either by email, text message or through an automated phone call.

In a report of their findings, they wrote what a positive impact the service had on users.

They wrote: 'Overall, the findings of the pilot were extremely encouraging.

The findings show that before the trial (marked in green) the majority of participants' responses fell within the moderate-severe to severe category, but afterwards (marked in blue) participants fell better

While some of us love the autumnal scenes, others dread the accompanying dark nights and harsh weather

Parts of the UK, including Clifton Ings washlands in York, have been flooded as the cold months roll in

The condition is caused by a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus due to the shortening of daylight hours and the lack of sunlight in winter.

The lack of light throws off our body clocks, leading to SAD.

Symptoms include lethargy, sleep problems, loss of libido, anxiety, social problems, depression and craving for carbohydrates and sweet foods.

For many people SAD is a disabling illness, preventing them from functioning normally without continuous medical treatment.

For others, it is a mild condition causing discomfort but not severe suffering.

This is known as subsyndromal SAD or 'winter blues.'

It is estimated that a further 17 per cent of the UK population have this milder form of condition.

'Their figures show that, prior to the pilot, the majority of participants' responses fell within the moderate-severe to severe depression (65.5 per cent).

'Post-trial only a small minority fell within these categories of depression (4.9 per cent) with the vast majority expressing mild to normal depressive symptoms (68.5 per cent).'

A spokesman for the Met Office said: 'The purpose of the alerts was to give them 48 hours' warning at times when the level of gloominess meant they were at risk of their SAD symptoms becoming worse.

'This would prompt them to use their light boxes and practice the healthy living routines provided in the self-help booklet

'These actions were aimed at reducing the effect of the gloomy weather on their health.'

They are now discussing whether to roll out the service permanently, as part of their health service which gives guidance to asthma and hayfever sufferers.

Most sufferers show signs of a weakened immune system during the winter, and are more vulnerable to illnesses.

SAD symptoms disappear in spring, either suddenly with a short period of hyperactivity, or gradually, depending on the intensity of sunlight in the spring and early summer.

In sub-syndromal SAD, symptoms such as tiredness, lethargy, sleep and eating problems occur, but depression and anxiety are absent or mild.

SAD may begin at any age but the main age of onset is between 18 and 30 years.

SAD occurs throughout the northern and southern hemispheres but is extremely rare in those living within 30 degrees of the Equator, where daylight hours are long, constant and extremely bright.
