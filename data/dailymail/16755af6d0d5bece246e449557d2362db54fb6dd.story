Australia’s meteorologists were yesterday forced to create a new weather chart as they prepared for the worst wildfires on record, with national parks evacuated and homes continuing to burn.

The Bureau of Meteorology added deep purple and pink to their weather chart's colours as its range was extended to 54°C from a previously capped 50°C, in anticipation of record temperatures.

Remote parts of southern Australia have already soared to 54°C, while Sydney hit a scorching 42°C.

Authorities warn of 
'catastrophic' conditions as 100 people remain missing in Tasmania after they fled homes engulfed by flames.

'We are shaping up for one of the 
worst fire danger days on record,' New South Wales Rural Fire Service 
Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said.

'You don’t get conditions worse 
than this. We are at the catastrophic level and clearly in those areas 
leaving early is your safest option.'

Catastrophic threat level is the most severe rating applicable. For the first six days of 2013, the 'national area-average' temperature had been in the top 20 hottest days on record.

In Boomer Bay, a seaside town in southern Tasmania, Merle and Terry Klug watched the fire ‘come in all around’ and said they were fortunate to be alive.

‘We couldn't go anywhere,’ Mrs Klug told
 ABC Radio. 'The heat was horrendous. It's a wonder everything didn't go
 up.’ She added that the fire came ‘over the hill like a bullet, 
cracking in the air’.

The Australian Met Bureau weather forecast map had its temperature range extended to 54 degrees – well above the all-time record temperature of 50.7°C reached on January 2, 1960 at Oodnadatta Airport in South Australia.

Already the forecast outlook has started to deploy the two new shades of purple that represent plus-50°C.

'The scale has just been increased and I would anticipate it is because the forecast coming from the bureau's model is showing temperatures in excess of 50°C,' David Jones, head of the bureau's climate monitoring and prediction unit, said.

Wildfires have razed 50,000 acres (20,000
 hectares) of forests and farmland across southern Tasmania since 
Friday.

In New South Wales, the country’s most populous state, the fires
 had burned through more than 64,000 (26,000 hectares) of land.

No deaths had been reported, although 
officials in Tasmania were still trying to find around 100 residents who
 have been missing since a blaze tore through the small town of 
Dunalley, east of the state capital of Hobart, last week, destroying 
around 90 homes.

small town of Cooma, south of the capital of Canberra. Cooma-Monaro

 been evacuated to the nearby town of Nimmitabel.

Strong winds were hampering efforts to
 bring the fires under control. Wind gusts more than 62mph (100kph) were
 recorded in some parts of the state.

All state forests and national parks 
were closed as a precaution and total fire bans were in place with 
temperatures in excess of 45°C (113F) in some areas.

Prime Minister Julia Gillard said residents had to stay alert.

'The word catastrophic is being used for good reason,' she said.

'So it is very important that people keep themselves safe, that they listen to local authorities and local warnings.
