Lengthy affair: Ginger White claims she had a 13-year relationship with Hermain Cain that lasted until he announced his bid for the White House

The single mother accusing Herman Cain of flying her across the U.S. so they could have a 13-year affair once sued a former employer for sexual harassment, it was revealed today.

Ginger White, from Atlanta, Georgia, says the Republican presidential candidate wined and dined her at the Four Seasons and other fine restaurants and hotels throughout their relationship, which ended only eight months ago.

But Ms White is an unemployed single mother-of-two with numerous evictions on her record - including one just this month.

In 2001 she filed a sexual harassment claim against her former employer, which was later settled.

She also had a protection order sought against her by an ex-business partner, reported WAGA. The partner, Kimberly Vay, also reportedly filed a successful libel suit against Ms White.

Mr Cain denied the affair, but a statement from his attorney side-steps the question entirely by claiming the allegations are not a matter open for public scrutiny.

But they represent the most serious claims yet against Mr Cain, who has been accused of sexual harassment against four other women.

And Mr Cain began defending himself 
before the allegations even surfaced. He broke the news himself on CNN 
that Ms White would make claims against him.

'This appears to be an accusation of 
private, alleged consensual conduct between adults - a subject matter 
which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public,' 
said a statement from Mr Cain's lawyer.

The statement, however, does not explicitly deny the affair.

In an interview with Fox 5 in Atlanta yesterday, Ms White said she was only coming forward because she was afraid
someone would tell her story before she herself could.

'I'm not proud,' she said. 'I did not want to do this. I did not.'

Mr Cain has been accused of sexual 
harassment by four other women, two of whom have come forward publicly 
with their allegations.

However, to this point, the only 
accusations were about inappropriate advances or comments. Ms White is 
saying he cheated on his wife for more than a decade

'It was pretty simple. It wasn't complicated,' she told the local TV station. 'I was aware that he was married. And I was also aware I was involved in a very inappropriate situation, relationship.'

As well as an alleged relationship with Ginger White, Mr Cain has been accused of sexual misconduct by four other women:

Mr Cain has been married to his wife Gloria since 1968. Both have vehemently denied allegations of sexual harassment.

And Mr Cain's denial of the new allegations were similarly complete. 

'I just wanted to give you a heads up and your audience a heads up, "Here we go again,"' he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN's Situation Room.

The Georgia native said he knew the woman as an 'acquaintance who I thought
was a friend.'

He denied having an affair, instead saying he tried to help her with financial problems.

Mr Cain said he would not drop out of the race and said he wasn't concerned that the allegations would hurt his candidacy.

'I'm more concerned what this will do to my family,' he told the CNN host.

Instead, Mr Cain deflected the criticism 
and said the allegations were part of an extended conspiracy to keep him
out of office.

As proof of the lengthy relationship, Ms White offered her mobile phone, which has Mr Cain's private number.

Ms White also showed mobile phone 
records dating back four months that have 61 phone calls and text 
messages to or from Mr Cain as early as 4.26am and as late as 7.52pm.

'He made it very intriguing,' Ms White 
told FOX 5. 'It was fun. It was something that took me away from my 
humdrum life at the time. And it was exciting.'

Ms White said the two met in 
Louisville, Kentucky, in the late 1990s when Mr Cain was the president 
of the National Restaurant Association.

That night, she says, Mr Cain took her out for drinks and then invited her up to his hotel room.

'I'd
like to see you again. You are beautiful to me, and I would love for us
to continue this friendship,' Ms White claims Mr Cain told her.

Going on: Mr Cain said he knew the woman as a friend but did not have an inappropriate relationship with her

From then, he paid for her to fly to his speaking engagements across the country, where he put her up in fancy hotels and restaurants like the Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons. 

Ms White has a checkered background, Fox 5 reports. She's an unemployed single mother of two children with numerous evictions on her record in Georgia - including one just this month.

She is currently unemployed and was sued by her former business partner. But she says her story is still credible.

'There would make no sense for me to come out with these allegations against Herman if it absolutely wasn't true,' she said.
