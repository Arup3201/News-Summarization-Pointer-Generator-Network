An 86-year-old man who suffered a bad fall was left laying on the pavement for more than an hour during a long wait for a delayed ambulance.

In the latest incident to highlight the strain on ambulance and A&E services, the pensioner faced agonising delays after the accident outside a Tesco store in Chester.

The trust in charge of ambulances in the area has now apologised to the man, insisting the wait was due to the 'unprecedented amount of 999 calls' it is currently receiving.

A pensioner was forced to wait more than an hour in the cold after an ambulance was delayed in Chester

Witnesses say an ambulance was called at 1.46pm last Thursday after the man fell over, but a lone paramedic only arrived around 50 minutes later.

The man and those helping him had to wait a further 15 minutes before an ambulance and two further paramedics eventually arrived.

The injured man, who has not been named, was left with a suspected broken thigh bone after the fall, and there was further concern due him suffering from an irregular heartbeat.

It was one hour and 19 minutes before he was finally put into an ambulance. It later transpired he had injured his hip, but not suffered the bone break first feared.

James Westhorpe, who owns a cafe nearby, stayed at the man's side as he lay on the floor.

He said: 'He was conscious but in a lot of pain and so cold being on the floor and we couldn't move him because we thought he had broken his leg.'

Shopkeepers and bystanders had to wrap the man up to keep him warm as he waited for help following a fall

Mr Westhorpe's wife Sarah said the pensioner went down with 'a thud', adding that his 'teeth were chattering after a few minutes' because of the cold. The couple took the injured man's wife inside and gave her a coffee to help warm her up.

Mrs Westhorpe added: 'It's not the paramedics' fault. They're working with the limited resources they've got.'

Jan Stocker, manager of the Quaker Meeting House, which was hosting Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper at the time, went to assist and said she was 'shocked' at the delay.

A North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust has now apologised to the man for his ordeal.

A spokesman said: 'We understand that waiting for an ambulance can be distressing and we are sorry for any upset caused to the patient.'

The incident comes as A&E departments around the country are struggling to cope with the number of patients. Pictured: Ambulances queue outside the University Hospital Wales in Cardiff

The spokesman added: 'We received a call at 13.46 to attend to a patient outside Tesco in Chester. A paramedic-manned rapid response vehicle arrived on scene at 14.38.

'The service is currently experiencing an unprecedented amount of 999 calls. Between 15 December 2014 and 15 January 2015, we answered 111,577 emergency calls, an increase of 13.2 per cent compared to the same time period last year.

'Regretfully, there was a delay with the ambulance attending to the patient due to this demand and the Trust apologises for the wait. We would encourage the patient or their family to contact us further to discuss any concerns with the service they received.'

The incident comes after weeks of long delays in A&E departments around Britain, with ambulances forced to queue outside hospitals while beds are freed up and trusts declaring 'major incidents' as they desperately try to clear long backlogs.
