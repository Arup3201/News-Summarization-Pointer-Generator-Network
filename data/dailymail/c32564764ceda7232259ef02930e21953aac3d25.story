Bestselling writer Elizabeth Jane Howard left none of her £1.3 million fortune to her novelist stepson Martin Amis – because she thought he was rich enough already.

Ms Howard, who died in January aged 90, was married to fellow author Kingsley Amis for 18 years before they divorced in 1983.  

Martin was close to her during their marriage and credited her with inspiring him to get an education and encouraging his interest in literature. Ironically, one of his most famous books is called Money.

Probate records reveal Ms Howard left a literary estate of £338,250. 

Her family confirmed that her personal estate, including her home in Bungay, Suffolk, was likely to be worth a further £1 million. 

She left the bulk of her estate to Nicola Sparks, her only daughter from her first marriage to naturalist Peter Scott, son of Antarctic explorer Captain Robert Scott.

Mrs Sparks, who also lives in Bungay, said: ‘She thought that Martin was earning a reasonable salary and it was not necessary to leave him anything.

'She just wanted to leave legacies to people who worked for her and made her life OK. She and Martin were on good terms and there was certainly no rift.’

After his stepmother’s death, Martin, 65, paid tribute to the ‘erratic and mercurial’ figure, writing in The Mail on Sunday of how she encouraged his interest in literature, firstly as a reader and then a novelist.

Before her intervention, he wrote, ‘I was a semi-literate truant and waster whose main interest was hanging around in betting shops’. 

But thanks to her ‘energy and determination’, she coached him to several O-levels, three A-levels and an Oxford scholarship.

Ms Howard, a former Vogue model who wrote the Cazalet Chronicles, was married three times and known for her colourful personal life. 

Among her bequests were £10,000 to her carer, £5,000 each to her secretary and home help and £2,000 each to two gardeners.

A spokesman for Amis did not respond to requests for comment.
