The hostage-taker killed after a siege in Sydney had fled Iran after embezzling some $200,000 from the travel agency where he worked, it is claimed.

It is the latest allegation to emerge against self-styled cleric Man Haron Monis, who was shot dead after a prolonged stand-off with police at a Sydney cafe on Monday.

Of his 17 hostages, two - cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson - were killed in the incident.

'Fraudster': Man Haron Monis fled Iran after embezzling some $200,000 from travel agency clients then avoided an extradition request from the Islamic republic by claiming asylum, it is claimed

An Iranian source told the Iran-focused Manoto News that Monis, known as Mohammad Hassan Manteqi in his home country, fled Iran in 1995 with about $200,000 entrusted with him by clients.

He had been the managing director of a tourist agency and had access to the cash to help about 50 customers apply for visas to visit western countries, the London-based site reported.

After arriving in Australia Monis campaigned to be granted asylum, despite an Interpol alert. His refugee status protected him from an Iranian extradition request alleging fraud.

The latest revelation comes after court documents showed Monis was facing up to 50 sexual offence charges, including aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault and inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act.

He painted the breasts and bodies of women with water, massaged their breasts and rubbed his genitals against them and raped them in 'spiritual healing' sessions all over Sydney going back 13 years, the documents allege.

The 50-year-old committed the sexual offences against women at his Spiritual Consultation business in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September this year, according to the documents.

He had been due to face court on February 27 next year.

A second source told Manoto News that Monis had in Iran been married to a university professor whose father is a deputy head of Imam Sadeq University, a key academic institution for Iranian officials.
