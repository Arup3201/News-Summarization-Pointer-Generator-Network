This is the chilling moment a drunk ex-soldier was captured on CCTV pointing a replica AK-47 rifle at a bus full of passengers.

Ian Kinney, 38, left those on the bus 'terrified for their lives' after embarking on the rampage following an afternoon of drinking.

Passengers hid behind seats, fearing that the weapon was real as Kinney pointed it at the vehicle.

Approach: Ian Kinney, 38, walking towards a bus full of passengers in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, armed with the replica AK-47 after drinking four to five pints of beer

Jailed: Kinney, seen pointing the weapon at the front window of the bus, was jailed for five years at Nottingham Crown Court last week

Footage of the incident shows 
the bus driver desperately trying to reverse in a bid to outrun Kinney 
as he pointed the gun at the vehicle's windscreen.

Kinney, who served in the army for 
four years, including tours of Bosnia and Northern Ireland, was finally 
halted when he a police marksman hit him with a baton round.

He was jailed for five years at 
Nottingham Crown Court last week after he admitted possessing an 
imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.

The court heard how the former soldier, who had no previous convictions, had been suffering from symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder

Kinney was also jailed for three months to run concurrently for criminal damage to a car.

The incident took place on November 
30 last year when Kinney started walking up to cars in his hometown of 
Long Eaton, Derbyshire, and tapping on drivers' windows with the barrel of 
his gun.

Fear: Kinney, who served in the army for four years, including tours of Bosnia and Northern Ireland, left some passengers 'hysterical'

Realistic: Steven Ramsell, defending, said the weapon was old and deactivated and kept in Kinney's shed

Prosecutor Gareth Gimson said Kinney 
drunk four to five pints of beer and could be heard by a neighbour shouting and throwing around a child's slide at his home.

He shouted that his shed had been 
burgled and grabbed his rifle before going 'into squaddie mode' and 
walking along the street 'looking like a soldier on patrol'.

When officers finally approached him, they said he looked like a man 'who had some military training'.

Judge Andrew Hamilton told him: 'They 
(the passengers) all pick up their mobile phones because they think this
is their last moment on Earth, that they were going to be shot, some 
were hysterical.

'You knew what you were doing. You were playing out a role because of your drunken state.'

Francesca Culley, 16, 
was just 
yards from her home when Kinney approached the bus 'slowly', walking in the middle of the road.

She said: 'I saw him turn the gun at the bus driver and us, basically. It looked like the front of the gun was up against the glass.'

Terrified: A teenage passenger described trying to put her head under a seat and calling her mother during the incident

Closeup: Kinney was involved in a standoff with police for 22 minutes before he was hit by a baton round

'It all went very quiet. Then the situation completely flipped. We heard the bus driver talking to us and he told us to stay calm and we all got to the back of the bus.

The teenager tried to put her head under a seat as a fellow passenger offered held her hand, before calling her mother, saying: 'There's a man with a gun.'

Wendy Culley then rushed to her front window and saw the Trent Barton bus surrounded by police.

Mrs Culley said: 'It was like something out of Die Hard. There were four to six police cars on College Street and two helicopters overhead.

'I said to my daughter: 'Do whatever the police or the driver tells you. You don't do anything different'.

'Then it was a waiting game. My daughter said: 'I don't know if the man can see my head'.

Kinney's lawyer said he had been experiencing similar features of post-traumatic stress disorder

'She said: 'Don't come out of the house because I don't know how many people have got guns'.'

The driver of the bus reversed and 
crashed into a parked car, but Kinney continued walking in the direction
of armed policemen who had gathered at the scene.

Officersrepeatedly demanded he put down the weapon in a 22-minute standoff but Kinney stood 
with the imitation gun across his chest, with his hand on the trigger.

Kinney was ten metres away when one of the officers fired an attenuating expanding projectile round at him.

Steven Ramsell, defending, said the weapon was old and deactivated and kept in Kinney's shed.

He added: 'A doctor's report said Kinney was experiencing similar features of post-traumatic stress disorder. He was under a considerable amount of stress at the time.'
