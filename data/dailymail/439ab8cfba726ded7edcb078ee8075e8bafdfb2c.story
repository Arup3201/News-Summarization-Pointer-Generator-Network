A dominatrix who chained, gagged and whipped her clients has applied for planning permission to allow her sex fetish club to remain open. 

Lorraine White has submitted a retrospective planning application asking for permission to change her warehouse on an industrial estate in Reddish to a place of 'photography and mild fetish play'.

She had been using the unit already without permission but has submitted an application after Stockport Council received a complaint about the dungeon, which she wants to remain open from 11pm to 7am from Tuesday to Saturday.

People living near to the Vauxhall Industrial Estate dungeon where Miss White restrains and humiliates men for their pleasure said they do not object to it as long as the business remains discreet. 

A website for Miss White's club has the warning: 'This site contains content pertaining to consensual sadomasochistic activity which some people may find offensive.' 

Miss White also refers to herself as a 'Manchester mistress' and 'sensual sadist.' Among her 'specialities' she lists bondage, psychodrama, sensory deprivation and humiliation.

The fetish club was discovered in 2012 when firemen were unable to get into the building after it caught fire because of all the locked doors. Miss White, who is known as Princess Lucina, was fined £8,000 for breaching health and safety laws at the time 

Firemen finally gained access and found a trove of handcuffs, chains and other restraining devices in the basement. They also discovered several canisters of nitrous oxide and laughing gas - also know as 'hippie crack' - which White’s clients used.

At the hearing at Stockport Magistrates Court Miss White said men were generally restrained or gagged in the dungeon, but nothing was too severe. At the time she said: 'It involved a lot of humiliation, doing domestic work and dressingup in women’s clothes.'

White has previously been fined for breaching health and safety laws after firefighters were unable to get in 

Jason Morris, 44, who lives nearby in Greg Street, said he wouldn't object to the change of use planning application.

He said: 'I don't care as long as everyone is consenting.

'I wouldn't have known it was there (but for press coverage), as long as it stays that way I'm not bothered.'

Jacqui Wood, from Arc arts group, based in the same building on the industrial estate, said: 'If it's legal and the landlord is OK with it then that's their business.'

Miss White, of Salford, submitted the retrospective application after the council received a complaint about the change of use.

A council spokesman said: 'The council is satisfied the unit is currently being used for purposes connected to the adult entertainment industry.

'Should the application be refused then the matter will be reviewed again and the council will decide on the appropriate next course of action.'

A dominatrix - or 'dom' - isn't a prostitute, but a female who feeds men's appetites to be controlled by a strong woman. Some dominatrixes don't even let their clients touch them.Their trade revolves around BDSM, or bondage, dominance and sado-masochism, with clients paying to be chained-up, whipped and gagged.

It's an activity that famously takes place in bestseller Fifty Shades Of Grey. The upcoming movie based on the bestseller stars British actor Jamie Dornan (pictured above with Amelia Warner) as the BDSM-obsessed Christian Grey.

A dominatrix will usually wear black and red, tightly fitting clothes made from leather or rubber latex - and high heels.

Some might wear a corset to ensure their torso remains in shape.

Dominatrixes sometimes let clients use nitrous oxide, sometimes called laughing gas or hippie crack', to attain a feeling of elation.

According to talktofrank.com, nitrous oxide has 'several legitimate uses, but when inhaled can make people feel euphoric and relaxed' with some people experiencing hallucinations.

It warns that there is a risk of death 'as a lack of oxygen can occur' with the risk increased if the gas 'is consumed in an enclosed space'.

The dominatrix trade is legal in Britain - with practitioners only likely to fall foul of the law if they cause clients lasting injuries or marks.
