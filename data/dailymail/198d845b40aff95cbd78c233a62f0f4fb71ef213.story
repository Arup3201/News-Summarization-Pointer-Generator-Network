A trainee teacher who stole a rare 18th century violin worth £500,000 has been jailed after a police sting operation.

The Guarnerius violin, made in 1735, was stolen from the home of classical musician David Roth, who had owned it for more than 40 years.

John Powles, 24, who is training to be a teacher, was jailed for eight months after admitting the burglary.

His accomplice Dean Barton, also 24, was sentenced to nine months in jail for the same charge, and a further three months for handling stolen goods.

The duo admitted breaking into Mr Roth’s home in Cricklewood, north west London, on August 17.

Harrow
Crown Court heard how Barton and Powles forced their way in while Mr 
Roth was out and made off with the violin, along with two candlesticks, 
some jewellery and a quantity of collectable foreign coins.

But
they were caught just a few days later when they tried to sell the 
violin to undercover police officers posing as would-be buyers.

Chris
Carey, prosecuting, said: 'This is an unusual case. The men were under 
surveillance by officers while trying to sell these goods.'

The
court heard that four days after the violin was stolen another burglary
took place at an address in Kilburn in which several items were stolen 
including two Apple Mac computers and a quantity of jewellery.

The thieves also took the keys to a BMW and Lexus car. The BMW was then stolen from outside the house.

Police probing the raids visited pawn and music shops in the local area.

Rare: The Guarnerius violin, made in 1735, was stolen from the home of classical musician David Roth who had owned it for more than 40 years.

On
the same day as the second burglary, a man visited a music store and 
asked a member of staff to obtain a valuation for a violin - now 
identified as Mr Roth’s.

Staff at the shop obtained a mobile phone number from the man.

Police made contact with the suspect via the mobile number and arrangements were made to meet at a hotel to buy the violin.

Powles, of Haverstock Hill, Belsize Park, north London, and Barton, of Brassey Road, Kilburn, north west London, were arrested when they turned up.

When police searched their homes a large amount of property was seized at Barton’s address and later identified as being stolen from the two burglaries.

Mr Roth, who played in the Allegri String Quartet for 30 years and is now semi-retired, said he was left distraught when his cherished instrument was stolen, having bought it from the Bond Street violin-makers W. E. Hill & Sons in 1968.

He added: 'It was a good one that was on the market at the time. The best I could afford I suppose, a fine Italian made violin. I was very upset when it was taken. We’ve got it back now.'

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Burns, who led the investigation, said: 'Any theft is distressing, but experiencing loss following an intruder breaking into your home is particularly awful.

'Officers carried out an excellent fast time investigation demonstrating teamwork and professionalism that resulted in the arrest of two residential burglars and return the stolen property to their rightful owners.

'We will continue to track down those who commit burglary on this borough.

'We are also determined to raise people’s awareness of security and help stop burglary from happening in the first place.

'Burglary, on the whole, is an opportunist crime often resulting from insecure premises, residents can secure their homes by taking some simple crime prevention measures.'

Chief Superintendant Matthew Gardner, Brent Police Borough Commander, said: 'This case evidences a superb piece of detective work which my officers deliver everyday.

'I am delighted that we were able to return precious belongings to the victim.'

In a separate incident, a rare 18th century violin worth £140,000 has been stolen from its owner’s flat, police said.

The instrument, a Nicola Gagliano dating back to 1747, is possibly one of only three in the world.

Its 31-year-old owner returned to his home in Erlanger Road, New Cross, south east London, at 10.45pm last night to find that the main communal door had been forced open along with his own front door.

Various rooms were searched and a number of items taken including the violin, which was in a brown rectangular case with two straps.

Detectives in Lewisham are appealing for information about the incident.
