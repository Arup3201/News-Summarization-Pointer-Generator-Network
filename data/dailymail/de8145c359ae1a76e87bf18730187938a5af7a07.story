Two senior police officers have been given their final warnings after allegedly being caught having sex in their station while on duty.

Detective Inspector Diane Davies, 44, and PC Tommy Swales, 53, who is married, were supposedly caught in the act by colleagues at Brecon Police Station, Powys, Wales, who thought the noises were someone trying to break in.

At the time, DI Davies was the most senior officer on duty at the force. Both were suspended while the incident was investigated.

DI Davies was called into police headquarters in Carmarthen, West Wales, after the chief constable was informed.

It is understood that the mother-of-one was in line for a promotion but was instead suspended pending a disciplinary investigation.

PC Swales, a former professional footballer for Darlington FC, is married to fellow officer Michelle, 42, and has two children.

A
 Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that two officers 
who were suspended from duty pending an internal misconduct 
investigation, have been issued with a final written warning.

PC Swales, a former professional footballer for Darlington FC, is married to a fellow officer. It is understood mother-of-one DI Davies was in line for a promotion before the incident. Both have refused to comment

'The decision was made by an independent panel chaired by a Chief Officer from another Police Force. The officers will recommence their duties in due course.'

Both Det Insp Davies and PC Swales had refused to comment on the allegation.

But a police insider said: 'It's been the talk of the force ever since it happened.

'It's not every day two police officers get caught in the act - they must have been making quite a racket.

'DI Davies is a career officer - she is very highly thought of and good at her job.'

Another source said: 'Incidents like this are treated very seriously. It's a question of integrity.

'Their colleagues would have felt compelled to report them. They were in the same office that investigates murders, rapes, assaults and serious crimes.'
