A mob of protesters set fire to the wooden door of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's ceremonial palace in Mexico City yesterday - denouncing the massacre of 43 trainee students.

Armed with torches, the group broke away from what had been a mostly peaceful protest demanding justice for the trainee teachers - abducted six weeks ago before being shot and incinerated by corrupt police in league with Cartel members.

Yesterday, three suspects told police investigating the slaughter that they layered their victims, many still alive at the time, 'like a grill' before bathing them in gasoline and setting them alight.

A mob of protesters set fire to the wooden door of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's ceremonial palace in Mexico City yesterday

At the Presidential Palace last night police put out out the flames and enforced fencing designed to keep the protesters away from the building - which was built for Hernan Cortes after the Spanish conquest and now houses Mexico's finance ministry.

Pena Nieto lives in a presidential residence across town and was not in the palace at the time.

In recent weeks tens of thousands of others in have taken to the streets of Mexico City and the southwestern state of Guerrero, where the students were abducted, to condemn the government's handling of the case.

It the toughest challenge yet to face President Pena Nieto, who took office two years ago vowing to restore order in Mexico, where around 100,000 people have died in violence linked to organized crime since 2007.

At least two people were injured in last night's protest, local television reported. Riot police cleared the square before midnight and an ambulance was assisting the injured people.

Police have now released footage of the the suspects using twigs and trash bags to explain candidly how they layered the victims 'like a grill' before soaking them in petrol and setting them on fire.

Their voices are cold and unemotional as officers follow them through the rubbish dump where every single victim was shot, killed and dumped in a river near Iguala in Guerrero State.

Gestering in handcuffs, one in a high visibility jacket is sat in the police station as he confirms reports that the students were targeted en route to protesting at a speech made by Mayor Jose Luis Abarca's wife.

Abarca allegedly demanded that the students be 'taught a lesson' so they didn't interrupt the event. 

He tells investigators: 'They came in the biggest truck. They asked them who they were, and they all responded that they were students.

'So they took them down and asked them why they had come to Iguala, and they said they had come for Abarca's wife.'

Another takes the investigators to the scene, using plastic bags as props. He dumps one on the dirt, saying: 'They let them drop like that. The students stood up and then they would walk like this [bending with his hands behind his head].'

The alleged gang member shows how they were then pushed to the ground and shot. Those that died instantly were then dragged by their hands or legs into one pile and the living into another.

Brazenly, one suspect then mimes how all the victims were swung into a landfill one at a time by two gang members.

'The bodies would roll until they reached the flat part,' a third suspect chilling recounted in a monotonous voice.

Chilling: This is one of three gangs members who walked investigators through the brutal alleged massacre of 43 students near Iguala, in Mexico's Guerrero State. He used a twig to show how the bodies were stacked

Unemotional: Another suspect sat handcuffed in the police station mimes swinging the bodies one by one

Cover up: A third leads the detectives down to the river by San Juan bridge where the bodies were dumped

Nearby, they built a circle of rocks and put tires in the middle, he explains. On top of the tires, they put firewood - all 43 bodies were then layered on.

'In the beginning, the bodies would be placed like this,' he said, scratching lines into the ground using a stick.'Like a grill'.

A second layer of victims would then be placed over them at a perpendicular angle, followed by another layer - 'until all the bodies fit'.

Two members - named as El Huassaco and El Deva - stood at either end of the pile and 'bathed the grill of bodies with diesel and gasoline'. 

Desperate to hide all trace of their victims, the men were then scrambled to find bottles and plastic to put on the fire to stop it from extinguishing.

They left with the fire still burning and came back to clean with trash bags and bottles to pick up the charcoal and bones, the suspects said.

When their truck arrived at the San Juan bridge a gang leader identified as 'El Turco' allegedly told the group to deposit the bags, making small holes in them so the remains were lost in the water. 

So far, 19 mass graves have been discovered around Iguala and 74 people have been arrested.     

The 43 students have not been seen since they disappeared near the southern city of Iguala on September 26 after being attacked by police.  

Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said: 'The high level of degradation caused by the fire in the remains make it very difficult to extract the DNA that will allow an identification.'

The bone fragments are being sent to Austria to a specialist laboratory for DNA testing. Police allegedly handed the students over to the Guerreros Unidos cartel who are believed to have killed them and disposed of their bodies.  

Murillo Karam said there is no evidence the students were involved in organized crime. 

The 43 students, pictured, went missing as they travelled to a protest in Iguala, Guerrero State, September 26

Authorities say it started when police, under orders of then Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca, opened fire on students who were in Iguala collecting donations and had commandeered public buses. 

Six people were killed in two confrontations before the 43 students were taken away and allegedly handed over to Guerreros Unidos.  

Jose Luis Abarca, who was previously mayor of Iguala, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda were found and arrested in Mexico City on Monday. They are accused of organising the alleged massacre. 

Concerned that the group were about to disrupt a speech to be given by his politically ambitious wife, Abarca ordered police to 'teach them a lesson' according to Mexican media reports.

Pineda, believed to be top of the criminal underworld tree in Iguala. demanded that police arrest the students.

It was thought her speech may have been her announcement of her desire to succeed her husband as mayor.

What's worse, the students had no intention of disrupting Pineda's speech, but were merely travelling through the town on buses they'd hired to take them to Mexico City for a remembrance service in honour of students massacred there in 1968.   

He admitted that many of the bodies had been badly burned which will make the process of extracting DNA more difficult. 

He said: 'I have to identify, to do everything in my power, to identify, to know if these were the students.'

Some parents of the missing students do not believe that their children are among the dead. 

Mario Cesar Gonzalez told CNN: 'We are not going to believe anything until the experts tell us: You know what? It is them.' 

Isrrael Galindo, claimed: 'The government is trying to resolve things its way so that to rid itself of this great problem it is facing. My son is alive. My son is alive. My son is alive.'

The victims were mostly in their 20s studying to be teachers when they planned to travel to Iguala on September 26 for a demonstration. 

Amnesty International has criticised the Attorney General over his handling of the case. 

Residents have held demonstrations calling for a full investigation into the fate of the 43 missing students  

Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas Director of Amnesty International said: 'Tragically, the enforced disappearance of these student teachers is just the latest in a long line of horrors to have befallen Guerrero state, and the rest of the country. 

'The warning signs of corruption and violence have been there for all to see for years, and those that negligently ignored them are themselves complicit in this tragedy.'

Amnesty said the mayor of Iguala has long been suspected of criminality and links to drugs cartels. 

Ms Guevara Rosas said: 'If the allegations against Iguala’s mayor and the federal and local police had been investigated when other serious human rights violations occurred, it is more than likely that the terrible murders and enforced disappearances of the students would not have taken place.'
