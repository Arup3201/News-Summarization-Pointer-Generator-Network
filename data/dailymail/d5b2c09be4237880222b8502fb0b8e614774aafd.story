Metro-North announced Sunday that new measures are in place to prevent a repeat of last weekend’s deadly train derailment that killed four people.

The commuter train operator said Sunday that automatic speed restrictions have been installed where William Rockefeller sped a train at 82MPH into a 30MPH restricted curve, causing it to jump the tracks.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority-owned rail is also implementing other changes meant to make rides safer for commuters.

‘Metro-North is taking important steps to improve safety for its customers and employees, and I expect the railroad will continue searching for ways to improve its operations and fully restore its commuters' confidence’ MTA Chairman and CEO Thomas F. Prendergast said in a statement.

The automated speed controls installed at the Spuyten-Duyvil curve will warn engineers of the impending curve and then automatically lower the train’s speed if the engineer does not, the agency said.

The protections will be on all trains as of Monday morning’s commute.

Automatic speed restrictions at other high-risk junctures will be in place in the coming months, said the agency.

Additionally, conductors will stand in the train cabs with engineers as they approach sharp curves and other areas with speed restrictions.

Horrifying: The high-speed train derailment that killed four people has led the MTA to adopt several new safety measures

This measure is likely in response to Mr Rockefeller telling investigators he ‘zoned out’ right before the sharp turn - and to federal regulators insisting last week the train operator make significant safety improvements.

The conductors will ‘verbally confirm all speed limits are adhered to,’ the MTA said.

In situations where the train’s layout does not permit the conductor to enter the cab - if the locomotive is in the back of the train, like it was during the derailment – speed reductions will be verified by radio.

Metro-North was not available to comment on whether an interim back-up plan was in place in the event a radio confirmation could not be immediately made until the automatic speed restrictions are in place next year.

Speed limits in several areas have also been reduced to eliminate speed drops of more than 20MPH. The appropriate signage will be in place within a week.

The train operator will also conduct more thorough speed monitoring of its fleet through review of train data recorders, having supervisors ride random trains and even the use of radar guns.
