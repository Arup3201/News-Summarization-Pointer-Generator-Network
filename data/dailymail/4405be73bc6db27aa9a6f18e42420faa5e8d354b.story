West Ham are ready to rise to the challenge of facing a Sunderland side managed for the first time by Dick Advocaat, according to defender Aaron Cresswell.

The Black Cats travel to Upton Park on Saturday evening just one point and one place outside of the Premier League relegation zone, having sacked Gus Poyet after last weekend's 4-0 home defeat to Aston Villa.

Advocaat has been appointed until the end of the season with the aim of keeping the club in the top flight, and Cresswell - a Premier League ever-present for West Ham so far this campaign - knows the game takes on extra significance following the Dutchman's appointment.

Cresswell admits it will be tough facing a team who have just appointed a new manager

'What was already set to be a tough but exciting game has that bit more to it now Sunderland have brought a new manager in,' he told West Ham's official website.

'I don't know too much about Dick Advocaat but he's certainly got a lot of experience and we're expecting a difficult match. Every game in the Premier League is a challenge and we will have to rise to it.

'When a new manager comes in it gives everyone at the club a lift and the players will want to impress the new manager.

'The first game under a new manager seems to favour the team with the new manager and I certainly think that was the case when we played West Bromwich Albion on New Year's Day just after Tony Pulis had taken over.'

Although Advocaat will want a positive result in his first game in charge, the fixture is also crucial to West Ham and their manager Sam Allardyce.

Following an impressive start, Allardyce has seen his side fall away from the pack chasing European qualification with the Hammers having won just one of their last 12 league games.

In that spell they have come up against Liverpool, Manchester United, Southampton, Tottenham, Arsenal and Chelsea but, of their final nine league outings, only two come against sides in the top half.

'We've had a tough run of fixtures recently and while no game is easy in the Premier League, some are harder than others,' Cresswell added.

'Having played all the top clubs in the last two months, we know that we have a fair few winnable games in our last nine games so I firmly believe we can finish strongly.

'We haven't had the results that we feel our performances deserve so we need to work that bit harder to make sure we get what our performances merit. No one at the club wants the season to fade away and we want to finish as high as we can.'
