The World Cup’s Golden Boot James Rodriguez scored his first goal for Real Madrid but it was not enough to give Carlo Ancelotti’s team the advantage in the Spanish Super Cup as Raul Garcia equalised from a corner with three minutes left.

It was more a game of two days than two halves with the 11pm local time kick-off meaning the match started on Tuesday and finished on Wednesday and it was on 'day two' that the goals came.

Madrid could have won it with their last attack when Mario Suarez blocked Dani Carvajal’s goal-bound shot with his hand but Atletico held on for the draw.

The game, played so late because of Madrid’s suffocating August heat, was a scrappy affair with Atletico Madrid frustrating their big spending neighbours.

The match was only four minutes old when Koke went into the book as he went in late on Pepe and the Real Madrid defender exaggerated sufficiently to draw the card from the referee.

If the first caution was harsh the second on the quarter hour was completely justified as Siquiera went high over the top of the ball on Bale leaving him needing treatment on the sidelines.

Bale it was who had had Real Madrid’s first chance running on to Benzema’s pass but shooting wide of Miguel Angel Moya’s right-hand upright. Against a full-back on a booking this early the night was shaping up nicely for the Welshman. He swept past Felipe Luis’ replacement with another superb first touch as most of Real’s attacks flowed down the right hand-side.

As badly as Siquiera was doing defensively he was able to threaten on the break and when he skipped past Dani Carvajal he won a corner off of Sergio Ramos but Madrid are always dangerous on the break from defending corners and only a Juanfran challenged prevented Bale racing away to score.

Modric then won two corners in quick succession but saw both cleared by the stubborn Atletico Madrid defence. Xabi Alonso then became the first Real Madrid name to be taken for going through the back of Koke and cards continued to outnumber goal-scoring opportunities.

One such chance came just before the break when Ronaldo and Bale swapped wings and the former headed the latter’s cross well wide. Real coach Ancelotti got the biggest cheer of the night with a perfect piece of control from another stray pass that had dropped into his technical area but it was cagey stuff from the visitors and there was no way through for the European Champions.

Ronaldo was taken off at half time as a precaution for a problem in his left leg and Rodriguez came on in his place. With the Portuguese international off Bale picked up the baton forcing a save from Moya at the start of the second half.

Having seen Ancelotti put his big summer signing on at half time Diego Simeone waited just ten second half minutes before putting Antoine Griezmann on for Saul Niguez. The tackles, meanwhile continued to fly in with Mario Suarez booked for a foul on Toni Kross and Sergio Ramos and Mario Mandzukic tangling with both going into the book.

On 70 minutes Real should have had the lead. Gareth Bale’s free-kick was punched straight back into play by Moya but Kroos blazed the loose ball over from the edge of the six-yard box. Rodriguez then shot wide as Real continued to press.

Finally with 15 minutes left Angel Di Maria was brought on. Madrid’s best player last season forced an immediate corner after linking with Kroos who had forced another save from Moya before the change.

Kroos it was he finally forced the opening goal. He played in Dani Carvajal who crossed for Benzema and when his shot was blocked the ball ran out to James Rodriguez who found the back of the net.

The Colombian's goal looked to have won it but from Koke’s corner Raul Garcia was alone in the six-yard box to poke home past Iker Casillas.

It had not been pretty from Simeone’s league champions but they had done enough to take a draw into Friday’s home second leg.
