A goldfish feared dead after a horrific housefire has been found alive and well after nearly two years in an abandoned pond with no food or daylight.

Smokey the fish was found by contractors who had been tasked with filling in the garden pond as part of the clean-up after the 2011 blaze in Harwich, Essex.

Jackie and Billy Broadley lost all but the clothes on their 
backs in the fire, which destroyed their and four neighbouring homes, and were delighted to find that one of their goldfish had made it to the 
other side.

Miracle fish: Owner Jackie Broadley thought Smokey had perished in the blaze, however the goldfish was found alive and well having survived 21 months without food and daylight

Despite spending 21 months underneath a thick plastic sheet with no fresh food, Smokey has grown from just one to three inches long, and has been returned to his delightful owners.

Mr and Mrs Broadley thought they had lost all their precious goldfish in the December 2011 fire.

Following the fire, Jackie's Koi carps, worth more than £3,000, were removed from the pond and had to be re-homed as the couple had no way of caring for them.

Survivor Smokey has been returned to his owners 
and although he no longer has a pond all to himself, he is now fed daily
 in his cosy aerated tank.

Experts have been stunned by the goldfish's survival and believe he may have gone into hibernation, using a tiny amount of energy to survive.

Burning streets: The 2011 fire destroyed four homes on the Broadley's street in Essex, and left more than 20 people homeless

Shock find: The destruction on the Harwich street, pictured at the time of the blaze, saw Bill and Jackie Broadley empty their pond and re-homing their £3,000 worth of Koi fish - but Smokey was left behind

Jackie, 60, 
said: ‘We thought we had caught all the fish from the pond - there was 
only an inch of water left in there - so I was amazed when we were told 
what had happened.

‘When I got the phone call to say there was a surviving fish from the old pond, I thought somebody was winding me up.

Pleasant surprise: Jackie lost everything in the fire in 2011, and is happy to have been reunited with Smokey

‘It’s
 really nice to have Smokey as it was a horrible experience for us to 
lose our house and have to re-home all our other fish.’

Jackie, a part-time cleaner, added: ‘It really has been a traumatic time since the fire - the blaze 
ripped through the house so quickly you would not believe it and I lost 
personal belongings that meant so much to me.

‘Getting
 Smokey back has really lifted our spirits - I could not believe it when
 I saw him. I think he must have survived on little insects and algae in
 the pond.’

Her husband Billy, 71, a retired lorry driver, said: ‘It was a real surprise to hear that the goldfish had survived.

‘We had given away the other goldfish after the fire but now we got the call to say that Smokey had been found after all this time.’

Professor Matthew Gage, a biologist from the University of East Anglia, said Smokey’s story exemplified the remarkable survival instincts of fish.

‘Fish, especially cold water species like goldfish, are able to shut down physiological processes to a minimum and go into hibernation when they need no food.

‘They keep themselves on trickle charge by living off internal fat and protein reserves laid down during times of plenty.'

And
 an RSPCA spokeswoman said: ‘Fish require oxygen in the water to breathe
 so it’s quite a surprise that Smokey has survived so long in a 
covered-over pond with no obvious source of aeration.

‘However it may be that there was just enough in the water for him to survive until now.

It’s
 lucky that he has been found as it’s likely that the build-up of waste 
products and carbon dioxide in a covered-over pond would eventually kill
 a fish.’
