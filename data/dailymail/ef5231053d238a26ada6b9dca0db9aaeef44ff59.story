As the executions of Bali Nine masterminds Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukuraman loom, fellow convicted drug smuggler Martin Stephens loses hope for a second chance at life.

Stephens was one of the nine Australians who were imprisoned in Indonesia after trying to smuggle 8.3 kilograms of heroin from Bali to Australia.

The 39-year-old has been sentenced to life and was moved from Kerobokan prison to Malang in East Java.

Martin Stephens has penned a letter begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo to spare the lives of Bali Nine duo

The married inmate has penned a letter to The Australian and says Indonesian president Joko Widodo has given drug offenders like himself no hope of living a normal life.

Mr Widodo's hardline on narcotics has Stephens fearing  'it would be better if they took me out the back and put a bullet in the back of my head' if he had no chance of reducing his sentence.

'It is more human to just take me out the back and shoot me like Andrew and Myuran,' Stephens said.

'Isn't 20 years a bad enough penalty? But life means no hope. It means I will die in prison. Can you imagine having to live like that?'

Stephens says the impending executions of Chan and Sukuraman makes him lose hope that he will never leave prison

The married inmate fears he will die in prison and never know what it would be like to live with his wife

Stephens has a good reason to want his life sentence reduced like Renae Lawrence, who is eligible for parole next year.

In 2011, Stephens married Christine Puspayanti - a Javanese woman - who he met for the first time while at Kerobokan prison.

She was visiting with a church group while Stephens was serving out his sentence in the Bali jail. 

Stephens also shares how he has forgiven Chan for his hand in getting him involved in the plot, but would never forget where the blame lay.

Ms Puspayanti - who has a daughter from a previous relationship - said she was lonely without her husband at home with her.

'My daughter and I would at least like to know when Martin might come home,' she told News Corp.

It comes after the Governor of Jakarta urged Mr Widodo to reconsider his stance on the death penalty.

Mr Widodo's close ally, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, said he believed drug smugglers who have reformed themselves in prison, like Chan and Sukuraman, should be handed a life sentence instead of death. 

'If from inside [jail] they're still controlling drugs, then execute them immediately that day,' 9News reported Mr Tjahaja Purnama as saying.

'But if people want to change, give them a chance to live.

'Maybe he can make other people more aware instead of punishing him with death.'
