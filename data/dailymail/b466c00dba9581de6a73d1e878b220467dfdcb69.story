A Lego lover has spent 30 years building a stunning collection of British castles using only the toy building bricks.

Bob Carney from Illinois, has painstakingly recreated 79 fortresses using Lego even though he lives more than 4,000 miles from the UK.

The 71-year-old has acquired up to tens of thousands of the tiny plastic bricks to build the castles, which include 30 from Scotland, 23 from England, 13 from Wales and another 13 found in Ireland.

Caerphilly Castle in Wales which was built in the 13th century and has also been recreated in Lego

Some of his most famous creations include replicas of the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Caerphilly Castle and the Castle Keep in Newcastle.

Mr Carney says his historical hobby began after he built his children a Lego castle in 1986 and he hasn't looked back since.

He explained: 'Discovering the castle, hopefully finding a floor plan, often imagining what a ruin might have looked like in its heyday, and bringing it to life in Lego has been mostly joyful and relaxing.

'It's been a wonderful hobby for almost three decades.'

The also keen golfer researches each castle in detail before he begins construction and draws up the building plans himself.

He added: 'I used to be a dermatologist, diagnosing and treating skin diseases and skin cancer.

'I would build castles from April to December before spending the winter months designing future castle projects.

'But after my dear "Lego-suffering" wife Judy and I redecorated our basement to accommodate my hobby, I now design and build castles all year round.'

His biggest creation so far is the Bavarian fairytale fortress of Schloß Neuschwanstein - which required a staggering 57,000 Lego elements to complete.

It can take the father-of-three anywhere from a couple of days to build a small fortification, all the way up to five months to create his impressive mega castles.

He admits he has lost count of the amount of Lego bricks he owns in his basement workshop as he buys them in bulk from specialist websites with the grey wall bricks the most sought after.

Each year he builds several castles - always creating a special Christmas construction - and plans future projects years in advance.

Mr Carney and his wife Judy are now planning an extended trip around England and Wales for their 50th wedding anniversary just so they can visit more castles.

He said: 'My wife Judy has become more adjusted to my hobby as the years have gone by.

'She actually suggested the re-modelling of our basement several years ago - a large part of which is committed to my Lego building and design.'

But with experts identify 2,700 castles in Scotland alone, he says there are no plans to recreate every castle in Britain.

He added:  'A leading expert has identified 2,700 castles in Scotland alone! I'm way too old to have that goal on my bucket list.'
