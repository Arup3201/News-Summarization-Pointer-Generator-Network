Reverend James Ogley, 38, pleaded guilty today to seven charges of publishing obscene material

A vicar has admitted having obscene conversations with children, one as young as 12, on an internet chat log.

Reverend James Ogley, 38, who is vicar at Saint Francis Church in Carteret Road, Luton, pleaded guilty today to seven charges of publishing obscene material under the Obscene Publications Act, 1959.

Six offences refer to online material from June 2012 and one to publication in November 2012.

Ogley, of Hollybush Road in Luton was appointed as the vicar of St Francis in August 2011. He was formerly vicar in the Diocese of Winchester, near Southampton.

The vicar was given bail by Judge Michael Kay QC and is due to be sentenced at Luton Crown Court next month. 

The judge warned him: 'All sentencing options are open.'  

The vicar was suspended from all his roles as a clergyman in January 2013 and remains so, a spokesman for the Diocese of St Albans confirmed. 

In a statement, the Diocese said: 'Upon conviction of a criminal offence, the Bishop of St Albans, the Rt Revd Dr Alan Smith, may, under the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003, impose a penalty on a clergyman without further legal process. 

'The Bishop will impose an appropriate penalty after sentencing.

'He will take account of what he sees as the gravity of this case and the breach of the trust reposed in Ogley by the church and by the parishioners of St Francis Luton.'

Speaking after the hearing, the Bishop said: 'I am deeply saddened that one of the clergy, of whom I expect the highest standards of behaviour, has committed these offences. 

'My prayers are with all those affected by James Ogley's actions and with the people of his parish.'

On the church website, it says: 'At St Francis’ we take the responsibility of safeguarding children as priority. We have a child protection policy in place and operate safer recruitment procedures.'

Defence barrister Andrew Morton asked for sentencing to be adjourned for probation reports to be prepared.

Ogley pleaded not guilty to two further charges of publishing material in April 2012, but those charges will not be pursued and he will not stand trial.
