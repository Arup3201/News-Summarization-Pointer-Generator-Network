Salma Hayek Pinault talks about skincare, adult acne, and taking time for herself in the newest issue of NewBeauty magazine.

Mrs Pinault tells the magazine that she has ‘always been conservative of what I’ve done to my skin. I don’t believe in abandoning it and then trying to fix it with something really drastic, really fast.’

In this vein, the actress says that she has never gotten microdermabrasion or a serious chemical peel.

Fresh-faced: Salma Hayek Pinault says that her skincare line is meant to enable all women to maintain their youth and beauty

The actress and mother to six year old 
daughter Valentina considers herself quite the skincare expert, as she 
released her own line called Nuance in CVS stores nationwide in 2011.

Mrs Pinault, 47, developed the skincare line in order to utilize tepezcohuite – a plant whose essence is used in burn units in her native Mexico. She believes that it has strong anti-aging properties.

'There were days I used to wake up, look in the mirror and go straight back to bed because my acne was so bad'

‘I could have made my brand a lot more expensive and it would have been a lot more successful. But then it wouldn’t have been accessible to all women who need it,’ she said, adding: ‘Every woman is entitled to her youth and her beauty.’

In addition to anti-aging, the label also addresses a skincare concern close to Mrs Pinault’s heart – adult acne.

Of her own experience with the ailment she said: ‘There were days I used to wake up, look in the mirror and go straight back to bed because my acne was so bad, so I get it….most brands still don’t want to give a solution because they think it’s not chic – it’s actually shocking. I think that’s terrible.’

Juggling game: Mrs Pinault says that making time fore herself has become a difficult pursuit, as family comes first

Now a mother, as well as wife to Francois-Herni Pinault, the CEO of luxury conglomerate Kering, Mrs Pinault says that her movie career has become a lower priority. Her family comes first.

‘My rule is that I won’t be away from Valentina for more than a week. And sometimes I won’t do a project because of that,’ she said.

‘It’s a new discipline. I have a child and a husband who always need me, and the one thing I can’t do is let myself relax and take time for myself – and I need to fix that,’ she added.
