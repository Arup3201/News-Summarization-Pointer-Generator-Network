Jose Mourinho returned to his native Portugal anxious not to offend Sporting Lisbon - the club who gave him his big break - but the biggest compliment he could lavish upon them was to confirm his plan to start with Diego Costa up front.

Costa's participation is ever shrouded in doubt as he nurses tight hamstrings but with Didier Drogba left behind in London with an ankle injury Mourinho has decided to risk his eight-goal striker rather than play Loic Remy at centre-forward.

'In this moment, if Diego can play, I play Diego,' said the Chelsea boss. 'The team had a pre-season with him. The team worked with him a lot of times. He's playing with us every match in the Premier League. So the team at this moment is more made to play with Diego.

'I think Remy is learning how to play with us. His pace is good, his movement is good, he can get behind defenders, he's not bad in the air. He has some similarities with Diego and if he has to play, no problem. But I prefer to play Diego.

'There is a risk, yes. But we assume the risk and he plays. I don't rest people. I make decisions. I don't think about Arsenal on Sunday. I think about Sporting. I'm going to start with the team I think is the best team.'

It is a clue to how pivotal Mourinho suspects this game may be. All the teams in Group G go into the second game with one point and one goal. A win in the Alvalade Stadium will put Chelsea in control before back-to-back games against Maribor of Slovenia, the team expected to be the weakest in the group.

There is also the emotion of a return to the club where it all started for him in 1992, when Sir Bobby Robson invited him onto his backroom staff.

Asked how it felt to return all these years later as one of the finest managers of his generation, he replied: 'Pride; a sense of pride. I was all I could be at this club. I tried to help the team the best way I could, at the beginning of my career.'

In an interview yesterday with the Portuguese newspaper Record he described his first role at Sporting as 'the do-it-all-boy'. He was born and raised in Setabul, 20 miles south of Lisbon, where there is now a street named in his honour.

This year's Champions League involves six coaches from Portugal, more than any other country. They are Mourinho, Sporting boss Marco Silva, Andre Villas-Boas now at Zenit, Jorge Jesus of Benfica and Leonardo Jardim at Monaco.

For the younger generation, Mourinho is a mould-breaker; the one who gave them the confidence to take what they knew to bigger football nations.

'He is the master of leadership and motivation, he is the No.1,' said 37-year-old Silva, last night, aware that facing Chelsea would be the biggest test of his young coaching career.

Mourinho after all is plotting a third Champions League win with a third different club and his team are unbeaten this season. His last game in Portugal was with Chelsea against Porto in February 2007.

'I'm not expecting to be received with special affection,' said Mourinho. 'I did nothing for Sporting. I limited myself to my insignificance. But I didn't do anything important to justify being received with particular hostility, and I've never stopped showing the utmost respect for Sporting and pride that a small part of my career was conducted there. Let it be the way people think it should be.

'The only bad memory I have of my time here is when I left. There is no grudge, no sense of ill-feeling. It's been a long time since I faced a Portuguese team, and it is a great joy to return. This will be a match like all others in terms of emotion. If I could choose, ultimately, the outcome of this group, I would place Chelsea No.1 and Sporting No.2.'

Drogba is expected to be out for at least two weeks with his ankle injury. Ramires is also absent with a groin problem.
