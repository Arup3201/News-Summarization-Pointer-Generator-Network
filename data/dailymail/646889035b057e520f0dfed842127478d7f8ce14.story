A new cover for Roald Dahl’s beloved children’s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was last night branded ‘creepy’ by critics.

The Penguin Modern Classics edition - aimed at the adult market - is being released to mark the book’s 50th anniversary.

But its cover, featuring a photograph of a heavily made up young girl wearing a feather boa and sitting on her mother’s knee with a doll-like expression, sparked an immediate backlash.

According to the publisher, the unsettling image reflects the way Dahl’s writing ‘manages to embrace both the light and the dark aspects of life’.

But after the new cover was slated by critics after being unveiled yesterday on Penguin’s Facebook page.

Best-selling Chocolat author Joanne Harris tweeted: ‘Seriously, Penguin Books. Why not just get Rolf Harris to design the next one?

Is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's 50th anniversary edition cover 'over sexualised'?

‘I’m not sure why adults need a different cover anyway, but who was it who decided that ‘adult’ meant ‘inappropriately sexualised’?’

Giles Paley-Phillips, an award-winning children’s author, said: ‘I’m not liking the new cover for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, looks more Lolita!’

Fans of the book also commented on the picture on social media.

‘This is a beautiful book and the cover does absolutely no justice to it. Pretentious and trashy,’ was one comment.

Others called it ‘creepy’, ‘grotesque’, ‘misjudged on every level’ and ‘distasteful and disrespectful to a gifted author and his work’.

It is 50 years since the book, by author Roald Dahl, pictured, was first published

One Dahl fan summed up the reaction: ‘Is there time for a reprint? You’re destroying my childhood.’

The tale tells the story of Charlie Bucket, a poor young boy who finds a golden ticket granting him entry to Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory.

Charlie is a sweet hard-working boy but he discovers another world of spoilt children and indulgence inside the factory.

Penguin said the girl in the cover photograph was not intended to be either Violet Beauregarde or Veruca Salt, the spoilt young girls who feature in Dahl’s tale, but a representation of the ‘twisted’ parent-child relationships depicted throughout the book.

The cover photograph was taken from a French magazine fashion shoot by the photographers Sofia Sanchez and Mauro Mongiello, entitled Mommie Dearest.

Many said they would refuse to buy the edition, claiming the image was reminiscent of US child beauty pageants and was more suited to Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita or to Jacqueline Susann’s Valley of the Dolls.

Penguin said: ‘This design is in recognition of the book’s extraordinary cultural impact and is one of the few children’s books to be featured in the Penguin Modern Classics list.

‘This new image for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory looks at the children at the centre of the story, and highlights the way Roald Dahl’s writing manages to embrace both the light and the dark aspects of life.’

The edition will be available from September 4.
