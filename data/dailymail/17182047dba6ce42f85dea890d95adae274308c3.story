The HS2 line has come under fire from the Church of England – over concerns that human remains will be disturbed.

The Archbishop’s Council, one of the Church’s most powerful organisations, called for ‘ecclesiastical safeguards’ before the HS2 Bill is passed into law to prevent the digging up of graves to make way for the rail line.

The council, which is led by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York, is fiercely opposed to the line because human remains will not  be ‘treated in a decent and  reverent manner’.

The Church wants the government to include 'ecclesiastical safeguards' before approving the controversial £43bn project, (artist's impression pictured)

It says it cannot back proposals for the £43 billion route unless MPs change legislation to give greater protection to the graves which would have to be exhumed.

The Church is said to be keen to avoid a repeat of the excavation of St Pancras Station during the building of the Channel Tunnel rail link, when graves were dug up with JCBs.

Sir Tony Baldry, the Tory MP and Second Church Estate’s Commissioner, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I would hope HS2 will be willing to engage and consider what they can do to mitigate the impact on churchyards and remains they may have to inter.

'It is a serious point. It’s a matter of common decency that when people are buried in consecrated ground they expect their remains not to be disturbed except in truly exceptional circumstances.’

According to a parliamentary submission by the Archbishop’s Council, the HS2 line will pass through three consecrated burial grounds.

Tory backbencher Sir Tony Baldry said: 'It's a matter of common decency that when people are buried in consecrated ground they expect their remains not to be disturbed in truly exceptional circumstances'

The expansion of Euston Station in North London will require more than 30,000 graves to be exhumed at St James’ Gardens, an 18th-century burial ground. And the remains of 2,600 people will have to be exhumed from a 12th-century graveyard in Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, to make way for the line, along with remains beneath Park Street in Birmingham where a new terminal is being built.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Throughout the development of HS2, burial grounds have been avoided as far as practicable.

‘We understand that the removal of human remains to enable HS2 to progress is a sensitive and emotive issue, which is why this issue is specifically dealt with in the Hybrid Bill and why HS2 Ltd recently published a paper setting out how it would deal with affected burial sites along the route’.

A Church of England spokesman said: ‘In terms of “opposition”, the Church of England is not opposing HS2 per se, rather we are petitioning for a technical change to the Bill.’

Other high-profile objectors have complained that the high-speed link will cause ‘intolerable noise’.

 A string of aristocratic families, including Earl Spencer and Lord Rothschild, are among almost 2,000 petitioners lobbying Parliament to stop the controversial scheme going ahead in its current form.

They have joined a chorus of protest from other campaigners who argue that the line will hit property prices, carve up Britain’s waterways and threaten countryside idylls.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has also entered a petition.

It demands  the Government backtrack on powers allowing constructors to disturb war memorials and First World War graves, without informing the Commission.
