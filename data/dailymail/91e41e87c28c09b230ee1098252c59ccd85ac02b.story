It was the symbol of love created by nature that inspired wildlife photographer Paul Mckenzie to propose to his girlfriend - thousands of flamingos flying a formation in the shape of a heart.

The stunning image was captured as Paul and girlfriend Paveena were flying over Lake Logipi in Kenya in a light aircraft.

Just days later Paul proposed - and he is now certain it acted as the inspiration for his life-changing decision.

Nature's love symbol: An image of thousands of lesser flamingos flying over the lake bed in the shape of a heart in Kenya inspired wildlife snapper Paul Mckenzie, 48, to propose to girlfriend Paveena

Irishman Paul, who lives in Hong Kong, said: 'While standing in, walking through or flying over the shallow waters of these lakes, large concentrations of these Flamingos will often miraculously take on familiar shapes.

'Sometimes these shapes seem to be sending cryptic messages. While flying with my girlfriend beside me, a huge concentration of flying Flamingos below us magically took on the shape of a heart.

'It's hard to know whether this was a factor that led to my proposal of marriage a few days later which was accepted - but looking back, I think it probably was.'

The formations throw up any number of interesting shapes, including in this snap where it looks like they have formed the outline of Africa

The formations can include up to 100,000 birds, which descend on the soda lakes due to the readily available microscopic algae which they feed on

The couple met in 2001 on a diving boat in the Galapagos Island and it wasn't long before they tied the knot.

Ever since they have travelled the world taking more snaps of the beautiful birds.

In one, several of the brightly coloured birds appear to take the shape of a mushroom, while another shows the rough outline of a shark like creature.

Paul and Paveena have travelled the world photographing wildlife and most of their best images have been captured from the air

Paul said: 'It is not easy as the light aircraft I shoot from are buffeted by wind turbulence, while I'm always conscious that only a loosely fastened seat belt is all that is preventing me from falling out'

Each one consists of up to a hundred thousand Lesser Flamingoes, who descend on the soda lakes due to the readily available microscopic algae which they feed on.

Paul added: 'I have been privileged to spend many hours flying in a light aircraft, with doors removed on one side, over East Africa's soda lakes. Often, especially in the case of flying Flamingos, these patterns will take shape for only the briefest of periods.

'Over the years I have learnt to be on the lookout for these shapes and have trained myself to shoot rapidly with my camera when they occur.

'It is not easy as the light aircraft that I shoot from is constantly been buffeted by wind turbulence, while I'm always conscious that only a loosely fastened seat belt is all that is preventing me from plummeting several hundred feet to the ground.'
