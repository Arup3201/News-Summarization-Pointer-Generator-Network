A father has been charged with pointing an AK-47 at his 15-year-old daughter because she only got a B on her schoolwork, it was revealed today. 

Kirill Bartashevitch, 52, allegedly pointed the deadly weapon at the girl, who is unidentified, in anger that she wasn't getting straight As in high school, according to MyFox9. 

The teenager texted a friend from Central High School, St Paul, Minnesota to tell her about the confrontation on January 17 and the friend's mother called social services, the report said.

Bartashevitch had just recently bought two of the assault rifles from Bill's Gunshop in the town, in fear they would be outlawed under government gun control legislation.

His daughter told him she 'hated' him when he confronted her about her grades and then swore at him. 

He allegedly pointed the gun at her in anger, according to the report, and when his wife stepped in between them he pushed her to the ground and allegedly pointed the gun at them both.

When arrested by police, Bartashevitch admitted to the confrontation but said the gun wasn't loaded.

Bartashevitch was charged today  at Ramsey County District Court with two counts of terroristic threats for pointing the gun.
