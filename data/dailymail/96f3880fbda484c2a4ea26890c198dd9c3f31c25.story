Two quick-footed llamas that dashed in and out of traffic in a Phoenix-area retirement community were captured by authorities on Thursday, causing a stir in the streets and on social media.

A large, white llama and a smaller, black llama darting through the streets of Sun City during the lunch hour causing cars and golf carts stopped in their tracks because of the wayward livestock.

The animals galloped along the sidewalk, through manicured yards and along street medians.  

Authorities have lassoed two quick-footed llamas who had dashed in and out of traffic in a Phoenix-area retirement community and caused a stir on social media 

A large, white llama and a smaller, black llama darted through the streets of Sun City during lunch hour causing cars and golf carts to stop in their tracks because of the wayward livestock

The streets looked more like a rodeo arena as several people tried to lasso both llamas.

Their televised breakout quickly inspired a Twitter account and several hashtags including #LlamasonTheLoose, #llamadrama and #TEAMLLAMAS. 

Someone also started a Twitter account with the handle @SunCityLlamas. The user tweeted that the idea was inspired by someone starting an account for a bear that caused a frenzy by running around the Phoenix suburb of Mesa on Christmas Day. The animal was captured days later.

The llamas thwarted numerous attempts by Maricopa County sheriff's deputies and bystanders to round them up before they were roped into custody.

The black llama was captured first. The white one was nabbed after two men in the back of a moving pickup truck repeatedly threw out a lasso. It took three men in all to secure the rope. 

Both animals were escorted to a waiting horse trailer.

The entire ordeal lasted about an hour. It was unknown if the llamas were anyone's pets. 

The black llama was lassoed first, leaving the white llama to roam the streets alone for a short while 

The runaway llamas quickly caused a stir on social media with several hashtags including, #LlamasonTheLoose and one person linking their escape to shamed news anchor Brian Williams
