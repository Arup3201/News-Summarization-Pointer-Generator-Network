One person has died and three more have been injured in a bridge collapse in Texas.

An oversized truck crashed into the structure along Interstate 35 in Salado on Thursday morning. It was under construction at the time with dozens of workers onsite.

The collision, which took place around 11:30am, caused heavy concrete support beams to topple down and halted moving traffic in both directions.

The truck's wedged cab was left completely crumpled and several other vehicles were damaged as debris scattered.

One witness said he saw smoke and flames coming from one truck and it took firefighters 'a while' to put the blaze out.

Construction workers rushed to the scene to see if they could help remove debris.

Victims were taken to Scott & White Memorial Hospital in Temple for treatment but no updates on their conditions have been released.

Veronica Beyer, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Transportation, told the Austin American-Statesman the bridge was just over 14ft high.

She said there were three signs posted two miles before the overpass stating the clearance height as 13ft 6in. A lower figure is given to provide a margin of safety.

According to the Texas DoT, trucks carrying loads higher than 14 feet must have a permit for an oversized load in order to travel on Texas roads. 

New technology at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) then determines a safe route for the driver to take.  

A spokesman said: 'First of all, the truck drivers know the heights of their vehicles. That's information that they provide to our DMV prior to moving out on the road with a load. 

'If the height of their vehicle exceeds the height of the bridge, they're going to be diverted'. 

But Lares Trucking, which owns the truck that crashed into the bridge, said the driver was not aware the bridge could not be safely passed and had a permit to carry the load.

Julian Lares said: 'It's a new bridge. Why don't they construct it more high? It's a new bridge. It's not an old bridge. Why [did] they give me, why [did] they consider the permit for such a small bridge?"

He added that the truck's driver, Valentin Martinez, had driven for his company for more than a year and had never been in any crashes.

The Texas DOT was in the process of building the second half of the FM 2484 overpass when the vehicle struck it and came to a standstill. 

Authorities said the bridge had been under construction for about eight months and was taller than the previous bridge.

Two other rigs and two pickup trucks also were involved in the wreck, according to Lt. Donnie Adams with the Bell County Sheriff's office.
