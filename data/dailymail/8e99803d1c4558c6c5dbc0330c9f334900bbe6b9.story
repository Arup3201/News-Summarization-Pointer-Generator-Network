Galatasaray are facing UEFA sanctions for crowd trouble at a second Champions League match this season.

UEFA says it charged the Turkish club for crowd disturbances, fans going on the pitch and throwing lit fireworks during a 4-1 loss at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. Play was briefly stopped twice.

UEFA’s disciplinary panel will judge the case on Nov. 13.

Galatasaray fans could be barred from attending its final away group match at Anderlecht on Nov. 26.

UEFA previously fined Galatasaray 50,000 euros (£39,000) for similar offences at Arsenal last month. The club was also ordered to pay Arsenal for damage repairs.

UEFA also charged Dortmund for disorder by its own fans and failing to prevent Tuesday’s incidents.

German police arrested 21 Galatasaray fans and opened a separate inquiry.
