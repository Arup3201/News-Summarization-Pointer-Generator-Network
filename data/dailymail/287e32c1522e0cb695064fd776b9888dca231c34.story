The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that a police officer in North Carolina lawfully
stopped a car with a faulty brake light - and then found a stash
of cocaine in the vehicle - even though driving with one working
light is not illegal in the state.

In an 8-1 decision, the court ruled against Nicholas Heien,
who had argued that the sandwich bag of cocaine found in the
April 2009 search should not have been allowed as evidence when
he was charged with drug trafficking because the Surry County
Sheriff's Department sergeant had no valid reason to stop the
car.

Heien, who consented to the search of the car after he was
stopped, pleaded guilty and was given a maximum prison term of
two years.

The officer pulled over the vehicle for a faulty brake light and found the cocaine (library imaged used)

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote on behalf of the court that
the officer's mistake in believing that it was illegal to drive
with one working light was not sufficient to violate Heien's
right to be protected from an unlawful search under the U.S.
Constitution's Fourth Amendment.

Under court precedent, a vehicle stop is valid only if the
officer has 'reasonable suspicion' that the driver broke a law.
The court concluded in the North Carolina case that 'reasonable
mistakes of law' like those made by the officer in question do
not make a search invalid.

Roberts rejected the argument made by Heien's lawyers that
such a ruling would dissuade police officers from learning the
law. He wrote that an officer 'can gain no Fourth Amendment
advantage through a sloppy study of the laws he is duty-bound to
enforce.'

Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the sole dissenter, writing that
the court was 'further eroding the Fourth Amendment's protection
of civil liberties in a context where that protection has
already been worn down.'

She said lower courts will have difficulties assessing in
future cases when an officer's mistake was reasonable.
