Two senior nurses at the centre of one of the worst hospital scandals in living memory have been struck off.

Sharon Turner, 48, and Tracy White, 52, stood accused of ruling the A&E unit at Mid Staffordshire ‘with fear’ by bullying other nurses into covering-up the appalling neglect of patients.

They are the first two nurses from the trust to be struck off. Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died there unnecessarily between 2005 and 2009.

Disciplined: Tracy White, left, and Sharon Turner, right, faked patient records to meet targets at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital. Today, they were struck off

This year a damning report into the 
scandal concluded that ‘appalling and unnecessary suffering’ was 
inflicted on hundreds of patients who were left ‘unwashed, unfed and 
without fluids’.

But until now, not a single doctor or nurse had been 
struck off or even lost their job over the failings, to the dismay of 
grieving families.

Yesterday the Nursing and Midwifery 
Council banned the two nurses from ever practising again for undermining
 the public’s faith in the profession.

The panel ruled they had conspired to 
fiddle the figures on waiting times ‘with sheer dishonesty’ and had 
‘coerced and frightened’ other more junior nurses to do the same.

Horrific: Up to 1,200 people died unnecessarily at the 'horror hospital' as managers put benchmarks above patient care

Mrs Turner, who lives in Cannock, 
Staffordshire, admitted to the three-strong panel she had once said she 
‘did not give a flying f***’ about one of her patients.

When told by other staff that a patient had requested something, she said: ‘They want to get f****** real’, the panel heard.

Mrs Turner, who qualified as a nurse 
in 1993, also allegedly branded Asian junior doctors ‘suicide bombers’ 
and ‘Osama’s mate’, in a reference to the late Al Qaeda leader.

The former ward sister, who worked in 
the A&E department between 2003 and 2009, also vowed to make one 
male nurse’s life ‘living hell’ leading him to take an overdose – which 
he survived.

Mrs White, who has been a registered 
nurse since 1992, bullied staff into lying about the length of times 
patients waited in A&E to meet the Government’s maximum four-hour 
target.

Astonishingly she is still working at 
the hospital and since leaving the A&E unit in 2009 had been 
promoted to one of the most senior management positions.

She is currently clinical site manager
 – in charge of allocating patients to beds – on a salary of up to 
£47,000, about £10,000 more than her previous nursing role.

Whistleblower:  Helene Donnelly said Sister Turner - along with Sister White - would demand junior nurses falsify the times recorded for when patients were discharged

Whistleblowing nurse Helene Donnelly 
revealed Sister Turner – along  with Sister White – would demand junior 
nurses falsify the times recorded for when patients were discharged. She
 recalled: ‘They would frequently lie about discharge times, and 
pressurise members of staff to lie. They would speak nastily and swear 
at people who did not change the times, or would change the times 
themselves.

‘The drive for targets was obviously a huge thing at the time. We were told that jobs might be on the line if we didn’t do it.’

Stephen Redmond, who chaired the 
hearing at the Old Bailey, told the two nurses that they had failed to 
put patients and their care first.

‘Instead you made the achieving of 
statistical targets, by honest or dishonest means, your primary aim. 
This was not a one-off failing, rather it was at the heart of the way 
you worked over a sustained period.’

He said they had resorted to ‘sheer
 dishonesty’ by altering paperwork and said they had ‘coerced and 
frightened other, often junior, members of staff into doing the same. 
You shouted and swore at them if they did not comply when you should 
have been setting an example.’

Julie Bailey, who helped expose the 
appalling neglect at Mid Staffordshire following the death of her mother
 in 2007, said: ‘This is the start of accountability in the NHS. We’re 
all very pleased at the outcomes. But there is clear evidence these 
nurses should have been suspended long ago by the trust.’

She also said it was ‘frightening’ 
that despite being struck off, the pair could still work in hospitals as
 healthcare assistants.

The cases began in March but had been repeatedly adjourned and had only begun considering evidence against the pair this week.

Another five nurses from Mid 
Staffordshire are having their cases considered by the NMC including the
 former chief nurse, Jan Harry.

Maggie Oldham, chief executive at Mid 
Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Tracy White is still employed
 by the trust. We will need to take some time to consider the Nursing 
and Midwifery Council panel’s findings.’

Among the most repellent examples of the behaviour of Tracy White was her lack of care and respect for an elderly woman in her final 24 hours.

She reprimanded the seriously ill patient by calling her a ‘naughty little monkey’ for not taking her laxatives, and refused to help lift her from a wheelchair to a bed, saying: ‘I’m not doing this. I’m not hurting my back.’

Whistleblowing nurse Helene Donnelly said the woman, who died the next day from a pulmonary oedema, or fluid on the lungs, had been given ‘a very uncared-for and undignified last 24 hours’. Another patient, who arrived at A&E suffering from bleeding after having an abortion, was refused immediate treatment by Sister White, who said: ‘She can wait, if you can do that to your baby.’

The whistleblower also claimed: ‘Sister White would deliberately make patients wait. Black patients were being made to wait.’

When junior nurse Mrs Donnelly was scathingly told off by another manager for faking a discharge time, she said she looked at the paperwork and recognised White’s handwriting.

But the senior nurse did not come forward to admit the forgery and was later promoted to her current role as clinical site manager.

On the wards, Sharon Turner sent waves of fear through junior staff afraid to challenge her expletive-ridden diktats.

When one bullied male nurse took an overdose in despair, she said he ‘should have taken a few more and done the job properly’.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council was told Sister Turner had vowed to ‘make his life hell and get rid of him in six months’ and ‘drive him to drink’ so that ‘he would be out of here’.

When a colleague was taken to hospital with  a head injury, the mother of two is said to have told staff: ‘I don’t care if she lives or dies.’

Asian junior doctors had to put up with appalling racist abuse from the senior nurse.

She asked one, ‘What have you got in your rucksack doctor, is it a bomb?’ and referred to others as ‘him in the turban’ and ‘her with the yashmak [veil]’.
