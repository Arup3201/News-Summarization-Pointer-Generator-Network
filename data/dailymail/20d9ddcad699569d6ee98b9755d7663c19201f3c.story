A former school teacher and Bengals cheerleader charged with having sex with one of her 16-year-old students has accepted a plea deal.

Sarah Jones, 27, is due in court on Monday to accept the deal and be sentenced, according to sources.

Her mother Cheryl Jones, a school principal, is also expected to accept a plea deal tomorrow after she was charged over tampering with evidence in her daughter's case.

Sarah Jones has been under house arrest after she was charged in Covington, Kentucky with sexual abuse for allegedly sleeping with a student at the high school where she taught English.

The women's lawyer  Eric Deters told WCPO that both of his clients would accept a deal but refused to give further details. 

The mother and daughter are expected in court on Monday at 9am.

Jones is accused of having sex with a 
16-year-old football player at Dixie Heights High School, where she 
taught English. She had resigned from the school in November citing 
'personal reasons'.

The five-year veteran of the NFL's 
Ben-Gals cheerleading team has said the rumours were started by the alleged victim's bitter 
ex-girlfriend.

However she admitted there were 9,000 pages of 
photos, Facebook messages and texts between her and the student.

Spotlight: Jones was charged with first-degree sexual abuse of a minor

The indictment, filed in March, states 
the alleged sexual relationship with the high school student took place 
between October 1 and December 31. She pleaded not guilty in April.

She also pleaded not guilty to 
unlawful use of electronic means to induce a minor to engage in sexual 
activities, a charge often reserved for people peddling child 
pornography over the internet.

Her mother Cheryl, 55, a middle 
school principal who is now on administrative leave, faces a single 
charge of tampering with evidence in her daughter's case. She also 
pleaded not guilty.

In the interview earlier this year, Jones said that she has only had sex with one man, her ex-husband, Nathan Wilburn. They married in July last year and separated just one month later. They are now divorced.

'Rumours': She also taught high school English but quit last November for 'personal reasons'

Jones also grabbed headlines in 2009 
when photographs and postings uploaded on TheDirty.com branded her a 
'slut' with 'two STDs'.

When she emailed the site to plead 
they take photographs down, more posts appeared claiming she had had sex
with Bengals players.

Appearing
on ABC at the time, she said: 'To stand in front of 30 15-year-olds and
tell them you don't have two STDs and that you are not a slut is the 
hardest thing you will ever have to do.'

Ms
Jones sued Nik Richie, TheDirty.com’s founder, for character 
defamation. She was awarded an $11million default judgement but the 
litigation is ongoing.
