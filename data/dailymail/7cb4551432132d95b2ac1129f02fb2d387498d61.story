Stumped for somewhere to go on holiday this year?

This is the hotel where guests are a guaranteed an absolutely tree-mendous stay - a fully-equipped 'treesort' boasting treehouse rooms connected by ziplines creating the perfect playground for children of all sizes.

The Out 'n' About Treehouse Treesort is the brainchild of builder Michael Garnier, who built the treetop metropolis in Cave Junction in Oregon, USA - where trees are the number one natural resource.

Branching out: One of the Treesort's brilliant treehouse rooms with ziplines offering a very quick route to ground level

Mr Garnier, known as an expert in treehouse 
construction, uses sliding brackets which allow the trees to move 
without tearing the treehouses apart.

The treehouses are accessed by a series of ladders and spiral staircases, and guests can roam around on catwalks connecting the various treehouses together.

Because some of the treehouses are located as high as six stories above ground, the housekeepers at the Treesort use ropes and pulleys to raise and lower cleaning equipment.

Each treehouse offers different facilities with some featuring all the mod-cons from bathrooms, a fridge, microwave, dining tables with space to sleep up to 10 people.

Some don't have inside bathrooms and are just big enough for two people while some of the bigger rooms have two floors, decks and are up to 35ft above the ground.

Mr Garnier said: 'I think it fits in with the state of Oregon perfectly - it's part of what this environment is, it's part of what Oregon is and it's tree-rific.

'We founded the 'treesort' in an effort to make a living off Oregon's number one natural resource without cutting them down.'

The Out 'n' About Treehouse Treesort also features forts made especially for children, five swings plus the Giant Tarzan, a swimming pool and over a mile of ziplines, with summer rates starting at $160 (Â£100).
