The sentencing hearing of former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes started at Sydney's Downing Centre on Friday morning, with emotional victims' impact statements read out before a packed gallery.

One statement, from a victim that MailOnline has not named, was read out by her father - who delivered her address without looking at the man now convicted of sexually assaulting his daughter.

'I was sexually abused by Robert Hughes in his home, while in his care, multiple times before I was eight-years-old,' the victim's submission began.

'I will never know what my life would be like, how I would view the world, or who I would become as a person.

'I have never truly felt safe ever again. As a child I never wanted Santa to come into my room at night to leave me presents.'

Earlier the victim statements of three other young victims were read out by a senior constable.

'Only getting the perpetrator stopped is healing,' said one.

'I never thought I would see this day... For you to be held to account. I don't look in the mirror because I'm totally disgusted at what I see. I feel dirty. I wish you nothing but misery.'

Those present in court, including pupils from a Year 10 commerce class from the Central Coast, watched silently as years of torture - stemming from the abuse on one of the most famous sets in Australian television history - were exposed in shocking detail.

'I have no self worth... I hide in baggy clothes... I suffered 12 years of eating disorders. If I hear even the first couple of bars of Hey Dad! I turn the TV off or walk out of the room.'

The victim statement of Sarah Monahan, a child star of Hey Dad! who now lives in America, revealed the she may never be able to return to Australia as a result of the abuse she suffered at Hughes' hands decades ago.

'I have come to hate the word dad,' her statement read.

Robert Hughes in Hey Dad!: The court heard from a number of Hughes' former colleagues who accused the former star of repeatedly exposing himself

A clinical psychiatrist who interviewed Robert Hughes for over an hour at Silverwater prison last week told his sentencing hearing this afternoon: 'What he said really was that (his time on Hey Dad..!) it was the best years of his life, exciting and fun.'Dr Olav Nielssen, a clinician with an interest in forensic psychiatry, gave a lengthy expert testimonial in front of a packed court.'He wasn't particularly distressed or stressed,' he said of Hughes during their private interview.'He was anxious, but there are quite real reasons to be scared where he was. [Child sex offenders] have a particular hell in the prison system.'Dr Nielssen was called by the defence and said he believed there was a low chance the former star would reoffend, but admitted: 'My prediction is that Mr Hughes will deny these offences to the grave.'Under cross examination, Dr Nielssen admitted the reliability of what Mr Hughes told him last week was 'reduced' given that he left out parts of his shocking history that led to 10 guilty verdicts earlier this month.'I'm not judging the case, I'm looking for psychological issues,' he qualified.He said, of interviewing child sex offenders in his past, that 'generally there's something creepy' about them, adding: 'I didn't detect any of that in the accused.'But he added: 'That said, he is a professional actor and a professional charmer.'Â 

'I learned that anyone in a position of power was free to do as they pleased. I have flashbacks to Robert... He made me think the world was a cold, evil place.

'I'm 37 years old and I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up.'

Hughes, 65, was also present in court, found guilty on April 5 of 10 child sex offences.

Hughes' lawyer Greg Walsh told the court his victim had been 'vilified' and 'denunciated' due to his high profile in the media.

He said: 'I don't believe that the courts have seen such an extensive degree of publicity. He was exposed to what could be described as extraordinary circumstances.

'He will probably have one of the highest profiles in the prison system. He will be looking over his back every day of his sentence.

'I would ask your honour not to impose a crushing sentence...this man is 65 years of age in many respects his life is destroyed.'

Prosecutors argued Mr Hughes required an 'exceptionally full time term of imprisonment' to denounce his 'abominal conduct'.

Hughes' wife Robyn Gardiner, who had stood by the convicted predator throughout the trial, was notably absent from court this morning.

Hughes is due to be sentenced on May 16.

In April, he was convicted on ten of 11 child sex charges, with the jury being discharged after not being able to reach a majority verdict on the 11th charge.

The trial took almost six weeks to come to a verdict, with Hughes pleading not guilty to all 11 charges against him regarding indecent and sexual assault.

The court heard testimonies from former childhood friends of Hughes' daughter, Jessica Hughes, who gave evidence in support of her father at the trial.

Two women said Hughes had entered their rooms naked during sleepovers with his daughter, and exposed himself or sexually assaulted them as they lay in bed.

Another woman recalled a trip to Manly in which Mr Hughes exposed himself to her while forcing her to swim between his legs and trapping her there.

Former colleagues who worked on set with the former Hey Dad! star also gave evidence at the trial, testifying that Hughes would repeatedly expose himself.

Hughes denied all the allegations.

The court proceedings took place in Sydney after Hughes was arrested and extradited from London after a two-year police investigation into the accusations.

Monahan previously said she 'got away light' compared to her on-screen dad Robert Hughes' other victims - but was relieved and vindicated by his guilty verdict.

The principal cast members of TV sitcom Hey Dad! appeared on A Current Affair in early April, following Hughes being convicted of child sex offences.

Monahan, who was six years old when she joined the show in 1987, first went public with her story of abuse four years ago in a Woman's Day article in March 2010. She went on to repeat allegations on A Current Affair, that she was abused while on the set of Hey Dad! by Hughes.

The actress said Hughes' guilty verdict of 10 offences relating to the sexual and indecent assault of young girls in the '80s and '90s 'vindicated' her
