Online scrapbook Pinterest, a photo-sharing website that allows users to 'pin' pictures that interest them to a virtual board, is being hailed as a web success story and boasts 48 million users worldwide.

But with 83 per cent of them women, the shared pictures tend to lean towards wedding dresses, cupcakes and pictures of babies and animals.

Luckily, if your man wants to join in the fun he can.

Manteresting lets men post pictures of whatever they like - usually beer and sheds

The online scrapbook just for men, Manteresting allows users to 'nail' their favourite photos to a 'workbench'

Manteresting.com, with 'manly' fonts and dark backgrounds, allows users to 'nail' pictures on to a virtual 'workbench'.

But do men really need their own website? Well, a glance through the 75,000 pictures reveals a pattern: it's mainly photos of sheds, beer, DIY, cars and, yes, the odd buxom pin-up.

It's probably best to leave them to it, really.
