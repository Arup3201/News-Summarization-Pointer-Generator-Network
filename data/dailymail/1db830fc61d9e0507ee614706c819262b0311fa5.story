Bill Kenwright has criticised Roy Keane for saying ‘some stupid things’ after the Republic of Ireland assistant manager questioned the pressure applied by Everton on James McCarthy and Seamus Coleman over playing for their country.

McCarthy wanted to play against Scotland last Friday but was left out after Everton continued to request updates on his hamstring injury. 

The midfielder has missed the Republic’s last three Euro 2016 qualifiers and Coleman sat out last month’s game in Germany. Both played for Everton four days later. 

Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty

Keane, who believes manager Martin O’Neill should hold talks with Everton counterpart Roberto Martinez to resolve the issue, said: ‘You always get the impression from Everton that Seamus and James are both barely able to walk.

‘So when they actually turn up and they are walking through the reception, you think “Praise the Lord, it’s a miracle”.

‘I worry that McCarthy is under lots of pressure, particularly from Everton’s point of view,’ continued Keane. 

‘There has to be some sort of sit-down conversation. I don’t think Roberto has ever played at senior international level and maybe he doesn’t appreciate how big the games are for us.’

Everton chairman Bill Kenwright countered: ‘I’m a big fan of Roy Keane but he does say some stupid things.

‘That is just totally, totally unfair. We absolutely love our players going on international duty and we never ever get in the way of them and Roberto Martinez will be as shocked as everyone at Everton.’

O’Neill said: ‘From my own perspective, I think the situation was this: way back the two lads were not fit for the games against Gibraltar and Germany (in October), and played for Everton a couple of days later. That is understandable.

‘I had spoken to Seamus and Seamus just wasn’t right. I didn’t speak to James at the time, but there was a thought that he might have played against Manchester United then, but didn’t do so.

‘I hadn’t really a problem with that at all, it was just that this particular time, James does have a muscle injury. He came here, he was wanting to try it and really wanted to give it a go.

‘We always thought that time would be against us and I think he will be perfectly all right to play at the weekend for his club, and really there isn’t much more I can say about it.’
