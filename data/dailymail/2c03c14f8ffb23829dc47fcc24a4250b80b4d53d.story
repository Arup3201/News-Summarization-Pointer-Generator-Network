TRAVELLING TO WORK by Michael Palin (Weidenfeld & Nicolson £25) 

Diaries are private places — places where the writer can take off whichever mask they put on to face the world and let their naked selves run around for a while.

‘I make no apology for exposing my doubts and fears,’ declares Michael Palin at the start of his third volume of diaries.

Yet, for the most part, the private Michael Palin turns out to be a lot like the public one. If you’ve gone through life under the impression that he’s a fundamentally decent, cheery, ever-so-slightly bland sort of chap, then you won’t find much evidence here to the contrary.

Michael Palin is publicly known as a comedian but the former Monty Python star has also enjoyed a career presenting travel documentaries

Occasionally, though, you catch a glimpse of something else, and the shock is so great that you find yourself wondering if there just might be another more complicated, less likeable Michael Palin lurking in the shadows.

At the start, he’s about to embark on his first big jaunt — Around the World In 80 Days. A comparative novice as a presenter, he worries about how much contrivance is involved in trying to be himself on camera.

‘I try to be as natural as possible, and yet time and time again I have to act . . . I can act — I can act — but I can’t act me.’

By the end of the decade, he’s an acknowledged telly star, winning BBC Personality of the Year in 1998 and being presented with BBC Series of the Year — for Full Circle — by none other than Baroness Thatcher. ‘Thatcher is small, bony, her face white and waxy, her handshake cool but a little damp at the same time.’

But however successful Palin has become, an air of melancholy still creeps in around the edges.

Some of the best writing here, both spare and vivid, is about death. Palin was with his great friend and fellow Python, Graham Chapman, when he died in 1989. ‘A single tear emerges from his right eye and rolls down his cheek. The mouth is set. The great ridge of Adam’s Apple is still. There is no more noise from him.’

A few days later Palin and the other Pythons attend Chapman’s funeral.

At the end, after the congregation has sung Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life, he sees John Cleese sitting silently, his eyes full of tears. ‘That I shall remember for a very long time.’

Four months later, Palin’s mother dies of a stroke. ‘The little body is crouched round like the Tollund Man, but her strong face remains beautiful though sallow now and silent. I bend and kiss her and thank her for giving me life.’

What becomes increasingly clear is that like a lot of comedians Palin takes himself very seriously. He has a seemingly inexhaustible appetite for praise, solemnly quoting someone telling him that his play, The Weekend, ‘will be around in 200 years’ even though it’s just been given a terrible pasting by the critics.

And while he can be fiercely self-critical, he doesn’t stint when it comes to giving himself a congratulatory hug. Referring to his series Pole To Pole, he writes: ‘It is the Sudan episode, number four, which I think will become a classic.’

There’s also a faint but unmistakable lordliness about the way he soaks up compliments. At a drinks party Palin is introduced to the novelist Ben Okri. It turns out that Okri is ‘a big enthusiast of my work, [he] recognises special qualities of naturalness and ease which he finds affecting.’

At the same time it’s plain that Palin drives himself extremely hard. In the rare gaps between jobs, he always seems to be discussing other projects, some so strange that they sound like things Alan Partridge might have dreamed up — ‘An interesting film idea,’ he notes. ‘A proposal that I should be seen in the U.S. trying to track down Bruce Springsteen; using his songs as clues.’

Amid this furious activity, his famous niceness wears intriguingly thin in places and an altogether bitchier Palin shows through — as when he refers to Germaine Greer as looking ‘for a brief moment, like John Cleese in drag’.

What’s clear, too, is how close — or closely tethered anyway — the Pythons have always remained. Scarcely a year goes by without some talk of a reunion and while it never happens, no one appears particularly resistant to the idea.

Palin is particularly proud of his achievements with his television travel documentaries

The surprise, in retrospect, was how long it took. That said, there are frequent quarrels too, mainly over the running of their film company, Prominent Features. After one meeting, Palin finds himself thinking glumly that Acrimony Films might be a better name.

But even when relations are strained, he’s fiercely defensive of the Pythons and doesn’t try to hide how irked he is that they’ve never received any official recognition.

‘I can only assume the Pythons are on some sort of blacklist, otherwise the group’s work would have been recognised as having as universal an effect on TV comedy as the Beatles did on music.’

The message is unmistakable: here is a man who longs to hear the words ‘Arise Sir Michael’ ringing in his ears.

Meanwhile life goes on, albeit in what now seems like an absurdly sepia-tinged fashion. In December 1991, Palin tries to master the new word processor his wife has just bought him and which takes up half the room: ‘Quiet and smooth, an easy keyboard, no paper to insert, no crossing out or Tippex-ing’.

It all adds up to an awkward mix. Although there are some revealing and affecting passages here, there is also a lot of flannel, as well as entries that don’t really hack it on any level — Saturday, May 6th 1996: ‘Will Carling has been sacked as England captain.’

Like Palin’s TV documentaries, his diaries slip down easily enough, but seldom touch the sides.
