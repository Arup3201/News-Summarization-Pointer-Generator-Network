An old man relaxes in the sun in the twilight of his life....far away and long ago from the time he wore the dreaded double-lightning flashes of the dreaded S.S. and worked in Auschwitz.

Now Hans Koenig, 94, is poised to answer for his role at the extermination camp where the Nazis put 1.1 million people to death during the Second World War.

He is among a handful of former servants of Hitler who thought they had got clean away with their crimes only to faces charges of complicity in mass murder.

Now Hans Koenig, 94, sits in the sun in the twilight of his life....far away and long ago from the time he wore the dreaded double-lightning flashes of the dreaded S.S. and worked in Auschwitz

Prosecutors, who arrested Koening and two other former Auschwitz guards in recent weeks, claim he assisted in the execution of prisoners in the camp in occupied Poland. 

His family insist he was an administrator and had nothing to do with the mass slaughter that took place on a daily basis behind the barbed wire and watchtowers of the complex.

Koenig, an ethnic German from Bratislava in what was Czechoslovakia, was known as a  'bruiser” in Auschwitz, a guard who allegedly liked cruelty for its own sake.

He doesn’t deny being at the camp and said:  'At the time the German ethnic group I belonged to had to be tested and I was happy to be a part of that.  We shouted hurrah!'

He claims no knowledge of the gas chambers, of the ‘selection’ of victims on the infamous train platform at the camp in occupied Poland, of starvations, beatings, murder.

''They should leave me alone,' he moans.  'It was all a long time ago...'

Perhaps the most notorious of all the Nazi concentration camps, 1.1million Jews were killed at Auschwitz.

The camp consisted of three main parts: Auschwitz I (the base camp) Auschwitz II - Birkenau (the extermination camp) and Auschwitz III - Monowitz (the labour camp).

During the war the camp was staffed by 6,500 to 7,000 members of the infamous SS - 15 per cent of whom were later convicted of war crimes.

It was run by camp commandant Rudolf Höss who was tried and hanged in 1947 for his part in the extermination.

The camp was liberated by the Red Army on January 27 1945, the day was subsequently declared International Holocaust Remembrance Day.

Following its liberation the camp has become a symbol of the holocaust and has operated as a museum since 1947.

Until last week Koenig was a prisoner in the penal hospital Hohenasperg but has since returned to his home near Stuttgart. 

Soon a court will have to decide whether he is competent enough to stand trial: one of the other two guards arrested in February has already been told he will not answer any charges because of the fragile state of his mental and physical health.

Koenig lives in a shared house that he built with his brother-in-law in the 1960’s. 

According to neighbours he passes his time playing chess with old friends, sunbathing when the weather is good, occasionally pottering around in the well-tended garden.

'He was in the local Catholic church organisation,' said a female neighbour.

'In his living room are photos of his grandchildren.  Until he retired he was an administrative clerk with the Stuttgart tram authority.”

Koenig was arrested due to the verdict in the trial against John Demjanjuk three years ago in Munich.

Demjanjuk was convicted of being a guard at the Nazi extermination camp of Sobibor without a single witness being called to testify what his role was in the camp where 250,000 Jews were murdered.

It was enough that he was a cog in the machinery of mass extermination.  

But his son Helmut, 62, said: 'My father wasn’t deployed in Auschwitz but was only involved in the site management. I hope that he will be acquitted.'
