This is the astonishing moment a lorry driver overturned his vehicle on a busy roundabout spilling 20 tons of waste across the road before crashing the HGV into the side of a house just 90 minutes later.

The driver's unfortunate morning began just after 9am on Saturday when his vehicle flipped onto its side on a roundabout in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, leaving tons of industrial waste strewn across the carriageway.

Police and two fire engines attended the scene and the emergency services managed to get the vehicle back on its wheels – only for it to career out of control and smash into a house.

The first crash saw the HGV overturn onto its side and spill 20 tons of waste across a roundabout in Cross Heath, Staffordshire. Police and fire crews were able to clear the waste before getting the vehicle back upright

The fire service had left the scene just after 10.30am following the first incident but within 30 minutes had been called out again after the same HGV ploughed into a house.

A Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: 'The original call was at 9.09am to Liverpool Road in Cross Heath in Newcastle-under-Lyme for a road traffic collision where 20 tons of general waste had spilled from a HGV on its side.

'A large amount of fuel was also spilt. We sent two fire engines to the scene, each with a crew of five crew members.

'We left the scene at 10.32am with police still in attendance, but no one was trapped in the vehicle.

'Then we received another call at 10.58am. The vehicle from the previous incident had been righted and then careered into the front of a semi-detached property.

'The same two fire engines had to return to that scene. A building surveyor was also requested.'

No one is thought to have been seriously injured in either incident and it is believed the house was empty at the time of the crash.

Cliff Beeton, from Tunstall, in Stoke-on-Trent, spotted the lorry's cab embedded in the front of the property as he ventured out to get a fish and chips supper.

The 58-year-old said: 'It must have happened when the recovery people lifted the lorry's cab back up.

However, just 90 minutes after the first crash, the lorry ploughed into the front of a nearby house (above). No one was injured in the crash but emergency crews were called out again, having only just left the scene 

'I don't know if someone forgot to put the handbrake on but it seems it rolled off and hit the home while their backs were turned.

'I believe the house is empty at the moment, which is a relief, but the owner's going to be in for a shock when they find out. The cab is completely embedded in the wall.

'My wife had seen all the rubbish strewn across the road earlier in the day and she couldn't believe it when I told what had happened.

'I was only going to get a chippy dinner and you don't expect to see something like that.'

Watch Commander Mark Weatherill, from Newcastle-under-Lyme Fire Station, said: 'We were called to clean up hydraulic oil and fuel and to check that no-one was trapped.

'We have dammed it and stopped the fuel getting into the water course.

'We were there for about an hour-and-a-half. No-one was trapped. The owners are now cleaning up.'
