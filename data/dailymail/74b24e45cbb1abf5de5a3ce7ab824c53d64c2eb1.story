Locked up: Rising Republican star John McGee, who's facing charges of drunken driving and grand theft

Idaho State Senator John McGee spent Father's Day in jail after being charged with drunken driving and suspicion of felony grand theft.

Mr McGee, a past 'Republican Legislator of the Year,' is accused of taking an SUV with a 20ft cargo trailer attached from the Boise area home of a 'complete stranger' after an evening of drinking at a golf course clubhouse.

According to the Ada County Sheriff's Office, 38-year-old McGee, who is the Senate GOP Caucus Chairman and the youngest member of Idaho's senate, began drinking at a Boise golf course at about 10pm Saturday.

The lawmaker, who lives in Caldwell, left the clubhouse just before 3am and began walking before seeing the Ford Excursion with the 20ft trailer hooked up.

The vehicle was unlocked with the keys inside. McGee got inside and drove away, authorities say.

Shortly after Mr McGee tried turning the vehicle and trailer around in a driveway.

But the move was unsuccessful and the Excursion and trailer jack-knifed and became stuck, Gawker.com reports.

According to Sgt. Carlos De Leon with Sheriff's Office, Mr McGee then allegedly left the vehicle and walked back and forth indecisively up and down the street.

Sen. John McGee's scrape with the law is the latest shocker in what is turning out to be a bumper year for scandals.

He follows Weinergate, Anthony's Weiner's cringe-making attempts to cover-up revelations of sending lewd photos to young women and sending racy texts both before and after his marriage last July.

Mr De Leon said two children at the home where McGee tried to turn the SUV were watching from a window.  

They called police after Mr McGee allegedly got back in the vehicle and feel asleep.

When deputies arrived, Mr McGee told them on he was heading for Jackpot in Nevada, on the border with Idaho.

A Breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol content to be .15, nearly twice the Idaho state limit.

He was booked into the Ada County Jail at about 4.30am.

The politician will be arraigned on Monday afternoon.

Lt. Kody Aldrich, of the Boise police, said Mr McGee did not know the owner of the SUV and trailer, adding that it was unclear why Mr McGee was in the Boise area.

Mr McGee is married and has a daughter.

He is deeply involved in transportation issues and has recently supported legislation to outlaw texting and driving.

Because of the nature of the accusations against he will remain in jail until he goes before a judge on Monday.

The lawmaker was named the Idaho Young Republican of the Year and Republican Legislator of the Year in 2006.

He was first elected to the Idaho Senate in 2004 and is currently in his fourth term.

Mr McGee works as the marketing director for West Valley Medical Center and is on the three Legislative committees: transportation, state affairs plus local government and taxation.

In the last Legislative session, he supported a bonds-for-highways plan called Connecting Idaho, which is aimed at maintaining Idaho's roads and bridges.

He also introduced a bill requiring underage drivers to take safety training as part of a compromise to fend off road closures and maintain public access following a U.S. Forest Service plan to close some roads to all-terrain vehicles amid safety concerns over underage drivers.

Fellow Idaho Republican Senator Brent Hill expressed support for MKr McGee and said the immediate concern is for his colleague and his family.

Mr Hill told the Associated Press: 'We feel really bad about the situation and how it may affect his wife and family.

'Our concerns right now are to help him and his family out any way we can.

'We just want to make sure things work out for John and his family.'

Messages left at the McGee family home were not returned Sunday.
