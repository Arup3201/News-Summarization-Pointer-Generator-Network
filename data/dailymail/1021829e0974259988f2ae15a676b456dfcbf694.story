A soldier from Fort Meade in Maryland has been charged with criminal homicide after authorities say he stabbed his 14-year-old girlfriend's mother to death early on Sunday in Pennsylvania. 

Caleb Barnes, 20, is suspected of repeatedly stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck as she tried to fight him off while they were in a car parked in the driveway in front of her Upper Macungie home.

It is believed the slaying happened after Silvonek told Barnes and the daughter she disapproved of their relationship.

When police arrived at the home (pictured) early on Sunday, they found Barnes and the girl in a bedroom  

After Silvonek was dead, Barnes and the daughter, who was in the car during the killing, took the other family vehicle to Wamart and purchased alcohol, bleach and other cleaning products, the Allentown Morning Call reported. 

They attempted to clean up the car, drove it to nearby South Whitehall and buried Silvonek in a shallow grave.

Police found the car submerged in a pond and traced it back to the Silvonek residence. 

When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband David.

The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep,CBS 13 reported.

Barnes, who has the rank of specialist, was charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. 

There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police.

She has been charged with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension.

It has not been determined if she will be tried as an adult or a juvenile. 

Defense attorney John Waldron said: 'She's just crying for her mom, saying she misses her mom.

'This is a child, who just turned 14. She's in shock.'

The girl's grandparents were in the courtroom during a hearing on Monday. 

Waldron said: 'Everyone was crying. It was just brutal.'

Barnes and the girl started dating in October. He joined the military in February of 2012.

He graduated advanced training from the Presidio of Monterey, California, and his awards include the Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal, Army Times reported. 

David Silvonek said he was not aware of their relationship.  

Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said. 'The mother became aware of the relationship and was attempting to have her daughter break it off.

'Obviously we don't know what occurred in the driveway. There are different versions of the event.' 

The girl is in a juvenile facility that will provide her with psychological counseling. 

A friend of Barnes said he had personal problems, 69 News reported. 

The unidentified female friend said: 'Anytime he was around me, he was very sweet and polite, but one day he would be the nicest person you've ever met and the next day he would be dark and gloomy and depressed.

'He wanted to be loved so badly, he was made fun of a lot.'
