Former Arsenal midfielder Alex Song has been made available for a free loan by Barcelona.

The Cameroon international was the only player to be left on the bench as Luis Enrique's side beat Mexican outfit Leon 6-0 in a friendly at the Nou Camp on Monday.

Song has returned to training after a disappointing World Cup campaign but is now deemed surplus to requirements after the signing of Ivan Rakitic from Sevilla.

Free to leave: Song has been granted a loan move away from the Nou Camp after joining for £15million in 2012

Barca officials have told the 26-year-old that he is free to find a new club, with a return to the Premier League his favoured option.

Arsenal could be tempted to bring Song back to the Emirates after selling him to Barca for £15million in the summer of 2012.

The defensive midfielder spent six years with the Gunners after joining the club permanently following a loan spell from French side Bastia, but may face competition from north London rivals Tottenham.

But he has failed to command a regular spot in Barcelona's starting XI and is now keen to play first team football elsewhere. 

The Catalan giants would like to recoup £8million by selling Song, but are willing to let him leave on loan. Turkish side Galatasaray and clubs in Italy have shown an interest in his services.
