Ex-partners who post 'revenge porn' online could be treated as domestic abusers under new rules for prosecutors which come into force from today.

Campaigners warn thousands of people have fallen victim to having explicit photographs published on the internet by former partners and spouses.

New guidance issued by the Crown Prosecution Service on tackling domestic abuse will include offenders using technology to inflict misery on their victims.

Guidelines on tackling domestic abuse have been broadened to cover technology-aided abuse like 'revenge porn'

The government has already announced plans to to make revenge porn a specific criminal offence under the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is expected to become law next year.

However, the new CPS guidelines are now in force compelling police and prosecutors to consider the use of private photos to exact revenge on exes. 

The new guidelines, which come into force today, brief prosecutors on the ways perpetrators can control, coerce and psychologically abuse victims within families or intimate relationships, and warn that domestic abuse occurs in all communities.

The guidelines have been broadened to touch on technology-aided abuse like 'revenge porn'.

'Some examples of such abuse may include controlling the use of a complainant's phone; harassment through text, mobile, email, social networking sites etc; posting of inappropriate material such as sexually explicit or nude images or defamatory or insulting comments; or, stalking a victim through the use of GPS technology on a victim's mobile device,' the guidelines state.

The vast majority of victims of revenge porn are female, such as Hannah Thompson, who was labelled a 'whore' on naked pictures placed on the Tumblr site by an ex-lover. 

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was hopeful that a rise in cases was a sign that more victims were coming forward

The popstar Tulisa Contostavlos was also a victim when a former boyfriend released a video of her performing a sex act.

In 2012-13 there were nearly 71,000 domestic abuse prosecutions across the UK, the CPS says, and this year that figure is expected to swell to almost 90,000.

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was hopeful the upswing was a sign that more victims were coming forward.

'Magistrates and prosecutors across the country are telling me that the biggest change they are seeing in the Magistrates' court room is the increase in domestic abuse cases,' she said.

'The predicted increase in caseload should be welcomed as a sign that what used to be a 'hidden shame' is now something that victims choose not suffer in silence, but there are still thousands of silent victims who should not be afraid to speak up about their abuse.

'These new guidelines will help ensure that our specialist prosecutors will handle these cases with the sensitivity, professionalism and expertise they deserve.' 

The guidelines also include advice on how domestic abuse can occur within gangs, and a section on immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers.

'These guidelines put the victims of domestic abuse, whoever they may be, at the centre of our work. They make it clear that there is no such thing as a 'perfect victim' and there are many pre-conceptions that need to be challenged,' Ms Saunders said.

'We know, for example, that domestic abuse occurs in all walks of life and is often under-reported, sometimes due to issues around fear, intimidation, and shame, but I would urge victims to come forward as they will be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.

'I am also clear that we need to consider the implications of our decisions to prosecute, such as working with the police to ensure that victims have the support to leave home on a temporary or permanent basis or that the offender leaves the home, and that they are not prevented from doing so because their abuser controls everything, including finances.'
