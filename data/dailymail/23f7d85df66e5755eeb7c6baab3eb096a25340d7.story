A former Texas prosecutor and one-time candidate for Congress has been convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for court favors, including an $80,000 payment in a scheme that allowed a convicted murder to escape.

Jurors convicted former Cameron County District Attorney Armanda Villalobos on racketeering, bribery and extortion charges. 

The former prosecutor was accused of taking more than $100,000 in bribes from attorneys.

Villalobos denied any wrongdoing and testified during his trial that he did not request money from lawyers in exchange for appointments with him.

Among the allegations were that Villalobos participated in a scheme involving Amit Livingston, who was convicted of killing his girlfriend, Hermila Hernandez, in 2007.

Prosecutors alleged former state District Judge Abel Lima agreed to work with Villalobos and Villalobos' former law partner, Eddie Lucio, in criminal and civil cases involving Livingston. The trio's target was the $500,000 bond put up for Livingston's release before trial.Federal prosecutors alleged Villalobos set up Lucio to represent Hernandez's three children in their lawsuit against Livingston, and the criminal and civil cases both landed in Limas' courtroom. In the criminal case, Limas agreed to convict and sentence Livingston on the same day, thereby freeing up his bond to be used as the settlement in the civil suit.

However, Limas also agreed that day to 
Livingston's request that he would have 60 days to get his affairs in 
order before reporting to prison. That
meant Livingston was released without bond, highly unusual for a 
convicted killer already sentenced to decades in prison. Livingston 
didn't report to prison as scheduled and hasn't been seen since.Lucio
received $200,000 in attorney's fees for handling the civil case. 
Prosecutors said he kicked $80,000 back to Villalobos and together they 
gave about $10,000 to Limas to keep quiet. Lucio
also faces charges in the case. Lima, who was one of the main witnesses
at Villalobos' trial, pleaded guilty to racketeering and awaits 
sentencing.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Wynne told jurors in his opening statement that the cash payments Villalobos accepted from attorneys in exchange for his prosecutorial discretion amounted to 'having a district attorney on retainer.'

'You pay him in advance so when you need him, he's there,' Wynne told jurors at the federal courthouse in Brownsville.

Prosecutors allege the activity took place from October 2006 through May 2012. 

Villalobos is a two-term district 
attorney who served from 2005 through the end of 2012. He ran for Congress 
last year, losing in the Democratic primary.He remains free on bond, but faces up to 20 years in federal prison for each of the seven counts on which he was convicted. Sentencing is scheduled for August.
