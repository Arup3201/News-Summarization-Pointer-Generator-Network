The men and women who lost their life in the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood will be awarded Purple Hearts.

Major Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, opened fire on November 5, 2009, killing 13 men and women at the military post in Killeen, Texas, injuring 30 others before he was taken down after being shot himself.

Now, due to an amendment to the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that expands the eligibility for the honor, those military members who were killed will receive the Purple Heart while the civilian victims will receive the Defense of Freedom Medal.

This also comes almost one year after FBI Director James Comey testified that he believed the attack was motivated by al-Qaeda.

Comey also stated that he believed Hasan was inspired by Al Qaeda to conduct that attack.

Prior to the event being considered a terrorist attack, the victims were not eligible for these honors, and their families could not receive the same benefits and payments given to those whose family members die in the line of duty. 

The new amendment tio the NDAA make the Purple Heart available to  those who die in an attack where 'the individual or entity was in communication with the foreign terrorist organization before the attack,' and where 'the attack was inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization.'

The amendment was sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz who, according to CNN, said last December; 'It's long past time to call the Fort Hood attack what it was: radical Islamic terrorism.'

He then added; 'And, this recognition for Fort Hood terrorist victims is overdue. The victims and their families deserve our prayers and support, and this legislation rightly honors them for defending our nation in the face of a heinous act of terror.'

It is now known that prior to the attack, Hasan had exchanged emails with  Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda spokesman.

Al-Awlaki praised Hasan's actions after the shooting, writing; 'Nidal Hassan is a hero. He is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people. ... The U.S. is leading the war against terrorism which in reality is a war against Islam.'

Hasan was convicted by a military judge in 2013 in the killings, and he recommended the death penalty.
