A gang who stored drugs in the drains and toilets of a health supplements shop have been jailed for over 100 years.

The group of 11 men used Anthony Donnelly's Protein Masters store in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, as a front for their criminal enterprise.

But the conspiracy was uncovered in July last year when a 10kg pack of amphetamine worth £227,000 was found in a van stopped by police near Doncaster.

The drugs were linked to Protein Masters and a warrant was executed at the vacant shop a few weeks later.

Officers from Nottinghamshire Police and the East Midlands Special Operations Unit (EMSOU) discovered over seven kilograms of a substance in residue form which contained amphetamine in buckets, drains and toilets.

They also found a vacuum packing machine and mixing tools, similar to those used in the construction industry.

Investigations led detectives to associates of Donnelly, 31, and Ben Mullins, 33, who were found with large quantities of drugs.

Michael Lawrence, 25, was discovered with three kilograms of high purity cocaine worth an estimated £600,000 which was bought in Humberside.

And Andrew Brimble, 48, was caught with 67 kilograms of amphetamines worth about £1.3million as he drove through Pinxton in Derbyshire.

The gang of 11 men, from Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Liverpool, Manchester and Yorkshire, either admitted or were convicted of a host of drugs related crimes.

And ten of them were jailed for a total of 105 years at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday.

Mullins, of Ripley, Derbyshire, admitted production and supply of amphetamines and selling cocaine and was jailed for 18 years and eight months.

Ringleader Donnelly, of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, was found guilty of conspiracy to supply amphetamines and was handed a 12-year term.

Sentencing the gang, Judge James Sampson said leader Donnelly was an arrogant, dishonest man whose word was worthless.

He said the men 'were trading in pernicious drugs' that 'destroyed families and blighted lives'.

Judge Sampson added: 'All of you in various ways and varying degrees were peddling misery in the towns and cities in this country.'

Gang members Daniel Robinson, 30, of Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, and Craig Donnelly, 23, of Huthwaite, Nottinghamshire, were jailed for 17 years each.

They both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply amphetamine but were found guilty of conspiracy to produce amphetamine and conspiracy to supply cocaine after a trial.

Michael Lawrence, of Stanton Hill, Nottinghamshire, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine and cannabis with intent to supply and was jailed for nine years.

And Richie Fido, 29, of Brinsley, Nottinghamshire, was jailed for five years and four months after he admitted conspiracy to produce amphetamine and conspiracy to supply amphetamine.

Condemned: The judge told the men including Craig Donnelly (left) and Daniel Robinson (right) - both jailed for 17 years - they were trading drugs which 'destroyed families and blighted lives'

An 11th man, Joshua Patchett, of Awsworth, Nottinghamshire, will be sentenced next month.

After the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Alan Mason, of EMSOU, said: 'This case demonstrates the complexity of drugs supply conspiracies which operate through a network of associates, some of whom may be located in different parts of the country, let alone the region.

'The East Midlands forces are determined to dismantle criminal groups which supply drugs to and within our region, and through EMSOU the forces have been targeting organised crime for a number of years now.

'This is the third case of its kind to be concluded at court this month and it is very satisfying to know that in just a matter of a few days more than 30 determined criminals from across the region who attempted to bring drugs into our communities have now been put behind bars.'
