A former homeless man who was stripped of his benefits after handing in $850 he found has demanded that authorities stop treating rough sleepers like criminals. 

James Brady, 59, last night criticized the Hackensack's Human Service Department's 'lack of compassion' in cancelling his General Assistance and Medicaid payments after his good deed.

The department controversially denied Brady his $210 monthly assistance until the end of the year because he failed to report his 'income' after police returned the unclaimed money to him in October.

The New Jersey resident spoke publicly about the experience for the first time at a Hackensack City Council meeting yesterday.

'Mea culpa on me if I had made a mistake, but it could have been handled in a more compassionate fashion,' Brady said, according to video posted by NorthJersey.com.

'I don't want to tell you what you need to do but I would like you to be a little bit more cognizant of the needs of the homeless. The homeless and criminal are not synonyms. I'm just trying to advocate for the homeless here.

'What I found is the social services in Hackensack sometimes works at odds with what other people are trying to accomplish.'

Hackensack mayor John P. LaBrosse, Jr., apologized to Brady for the embarrassing system failure.

'This situation should never have happened. The system itself should have something in place that throws up a red flag when something like this happens, so a person like Mr Brady doesn't get stuck in this situation,' he said.

'People in Mr Brady's situation shouldn't have to go through this. They've already gone through enough. Again I apologize to you, Mr Brady, for this happening.'

Meanwhile, department officials are investigating the incident and plan to restore Brady's benefits.

Bergen County Executive chief of staff Jeanne Barrata said New Jersey's Commissioner of Human Services, Jennifer Velez, was working to rectify the situation.

'I know that this council is not at fault and your human services department is not at fault because everything was done by the book and as it should have been. Could it have been handled a little bit better? Absolutely,' she said, according to video posted by NorthJersey.com.

'She [Velez] wanted me to convey to you tonight that the Governor's office is aware of this and that the department of human services will do whatever they can to rectify the situation for Mr Brady and the state will help him.

'He's got housing now, but they're willing to help him with that. They will help him rectify this situation to get the records right so he can get his Medicaid, he can get his benefits and we can fix this.' 

Honest: Hackensack Main Street, where a homeless James Brady found an envelope containing $850 and turned it into police

Brady's battle with bureaucracy began in October when a public servant read about his 'cash windfall'.

Brady made headlines last month for handing in to police $850 he found in an envelope on a sidewalk on April 16, even though he was homeless and unemployed.

He turned in the cash because 'he didn't want to take money 
from anyone who could be worse off' than himself.

Police gave him back the money because no-one claimed it.

He
received praise from well-wishers and a commendation from the City 
Council, and moved into an apartment with a county housing voucher that 
paid for all but $5 of his $1,095 rent.

But Human Services director Agatha Toomey
wasn't impressed.

Last month, she called Brady in for a meeting, armed with a print-out of a news story about Brady's good deed and 
subsequent windfall.

Toomey asked Brady how he had spent the $850. He told her he had bought napkins, toilet paper, a bathmat and a sandwich. 

Of benefit: Brady receives $210 per month as well as medical benefits, both of which have been halted

He
then received a letter informing him that his $210 per month and his 
Medicaid had been cut off from 18 October until 31 December.

'I’m
sorry but we had to - I had to - follow regulations,' Toomey told the Record. 'He only pays $5 [a month] in rent.'

Brady was appalled.

'This is stupid,' Brady said. 'I
had already proven my honesty by turning in the $850. They were 
treating me like I was a dishonest individual, like I was trying to 
cheat them out of the money.'

Shocked by the news, people from across 
the U.S. rallied to support Brady through social media, letters and 
donations that have totaled more than $6000.

'I’m amazed. One of the things is: I didn’t ask for any of this. I was just putting myself out there because I wanted to help homeless in Hackensack,' he said.

'To see it get picked up by so many papers and the response — it’s tremendous. People are very sympathetic.'

Authorities said James Brady's payments would be restored

Toomey did not appear at last night's council meeting.

But her friend Stefani Pedone told the meeting that Toomey didn't deserve to be bad-mouthed.

'It's a wonderful thing that we have people that are honest in this world and do the right thing,' Pedone said.

'However, what has been going on in the newspaper, on the internet on the blogs against a woman who has devoted 38 years of her life to the City of Hackensack, there is nobody more compassionate than Mrs Toomey.

'So if she went by the books, and according to the books, she did the right thing. The city should not be chastising someone like Mrs Toomey.'

Brady's descent into homelessness began after the September 11 terrorist attacks in Manhattan.

He had worked as a news photographer before becoming a market data analyst.

He
lost his job due to a merger and was looking for work in 2001. He had 
been due to attend a finance and technology exposition at the World 
Trade Center on September 11 but canceled.

Brady
was left traumatized by the knowledge he could have been killed in the 
attacks and sank into depression, using up his savings and retirement 
fund until he was evicted from him apartment and became homeless.
