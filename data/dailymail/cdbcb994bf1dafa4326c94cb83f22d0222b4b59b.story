Gordon Brown yesterday called on older Scots to tell their grandchildren how they fought ‘side by side’ with the English in the Second World War.

Ahead of tomorrow’s independence referendum, the former Prime Minister said the younger generation needed to know about the achievements of the UK.

Defeating the Nazis and creating the NHS and the welfare state all happened because England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had stuck together, he said.

Mr Brown asked: ‘And when someone was injured, nobody asked are you Scots, English, Welsh or Irish? We all came to each other’s aid because we were in a common fight, struggling and working together’

Polls have shown that the over-65s are less likely than youngsters to support independence and are believed to be vital to the result.

Speaking at a No rally in Clydebank, near Glasgow, which suffered more bombing in the war than anywhere outside London and Coventry, Mr Brown said: ‘There are Scots, English, Welsh and Irish who fought side by side during the Second World War.

‘There is not a battlefield in Europe where we did not fight with others. There is not a cemetery where you don’t find Scots, English, Welsh and Irish lying side by side.

‘And when someone was injured, nobody asked are you Scots, English, Welsh or Irish? We all came to each other’s aid because we were in a common fight, struggling and working together.’

The former Labour leader said the common endeavour should be explained to the young.

‘Tell them something: tell them that we had to fight a war together to ensure peace in this country,’ he said.

Mr Brown was speaking after a leaked document showed the SNP-led Scottish Government is planning £450million in NHS cuts – despite claiming to be the only party that can be trusted with its future.

He said the nationalists were ‘perpetrating a lie’ that only secession would allow Scotland to protect the NHS from privatisation. Mr Brown added that he had received support from the surgeon who saved his right eye after a rugby accident as a teenager.

And he said an independent Scotland’s army would be like Dad’s Army. He suggested secession would mean ‘we’re all doomed’ – the catchphrase of Private Frazer in the BBC comedy.

An independent Scotland would have to send radioactive waste from its two nuclear power stations to England while it builds new space to store or dump it, a leading expert has warned.

Britain can already store some waste at Sellafield and is in the process of trying to find a suitable site to dump radioactive material underground for the long term.

But nuclear expert Malcolm Grimston of Imperial College warned that Scotland could not add to limited storage at its two sites, Torness and Hunterston, before independence.

‘They can’t have that space in 18 months,’ said Mr Grimston, casting doubt on a nuclear-free Scotland pledge. He added that the cost of long-term building storage facilities could cost ‘in the billions’ and take 25 years to complete.
