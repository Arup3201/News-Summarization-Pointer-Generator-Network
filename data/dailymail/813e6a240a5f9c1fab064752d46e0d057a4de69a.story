A local council awarded £100,000 as part of a pilot by Mary Portas to kickstart the regeneration of town centres has been accused of wasting the money after it spent £1,600 on hiring a man in a Peppa Pig costume.

Freedom of Information requests have revealed the 12 'Portas Pilot' towns awarded a total of £1.2m have spent just 12 per cent of their funding.

And some councils have been accused of wasting parts of the £100,000 they were presented with, following a review by Mary Portas, on items including the man in the Peppa Pig costume and £5,983 on newspaper adverts.

Funding: Councils have spent just 12 per cent of the money awarded to them following the Mary Portas (left) review. One authority however spent £1,600 on a man in a Peppa Pig costume (similar to the one pictured right)

Freedom of Information requests, responded to by 11 of the Portas Pilots, found that by December 31, just £136,000 had been spent of the £1.1m awarded, The Independent has reported.

The self-styled Queen of Shops was commissioned by the government in 2011 to conduct an independent review of the future of British High Streets.

In her resulting 'Portas Review', she found town centres around the country were losing their appeal to locals and identified the need to 'put the heart back into the centre of our High Streets'. She suggested this could be done by making the destinations more than just a place to shop.

The government made £2.7m available to run a series of pilots trialling Portas' recommendations and bids were made from towns around the country.

But as fashion chain Republic collapses into administration, putting 2,500 jobs at risk, and following the troubles seen at Blockbusters, HMV and Jessops, retail experts have been angered by the progress of the Portas Pilots.

Paul Turner-Mitchell, who submitted the FOI requests, asked why much of the money was still sitting in local authority bank accounts.

Mr Turner-Mitchell, a director of Rochdale-based retailer 25 Ten Boutique, said: 'It's disappointing that, given this unique opportunity to try something different, many councils have wasted funding on the usual bureaucracy of meetings, expense claims and consultants.'

The FOI requests found Croydon had spent £4,950 of its £1000,000, while Stockport, which received an extra £362,000 from the council and other bodies, had spent just £25,800 of its total.

John O'Mara, the chairman of Stockport Town Team, said the money was part of a pilot, which was about new ways of working, and things didn't happen overnight.

He said: 'What's important is getting this right, not how quickly we get the money out of the door.'

Elsewhere, Dartford Council spent £1,160 hiring a person in a Peppa Pig costume, £317.46 on items from Waitrose, £5,983 on newspaper surveys and £1,317 on surveys.

'The main aim of this scheme has been to
harness the energy and enthusiasm of local people to breathe new life 
into the town centres and make them the hearts of their communities once
again'

A Dartford spokeswoman said adverts in local newspapers were used to promote the launch of Sunday trading in the town, a six-month Sunday market pilot, and a bursary scheme for businesses looking to set up in the market.

The spokesman said: 'The council hired Peppa Pig for the day as it's a proven way to draw in families to events.'

A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: 'The Government has given the Portas Pilots a share of £2.4million to spend as and when they see fit to best improve their high streets and encourage residents to shop locally.'The main aim of this scheme has been to harness the energy and enthusiasm of local people to breathe new life into the town centres and make them the hearts of their communities once again.  Pilots up and down the country are already doing this very successfully, from Nelson bringing empty shops back into use, to Market Rasen backing an award-winning local market.'But this is just the start, which is why Local Growth Minister Mark Prisk has also announced a Future High Streets Forum, made up of leading figures from the retail industry, to provide advice and support to town teams across the country to help their high streets thrive and prosper.'
