These are the fleeting moments in which a man makes a breath-taking escape through a tiny gap in his prison cell bars.

Filmed from inside a South African jail cell the 33 second clip shows the slender man posing briefly inside before hauling himself between the minuscule gap in a furious bid for freedom.

Local website thesouthafrican.com claims the cell is a standard police holding cell.The escapee achieves the feat with speed and confidence.

Posing confidently: An audience gathers as the man prepares himself to slip through the jail cell's bars

The first 20 Seconds: It takes the escapee little time to get his head and shoulders through the minuscule gap

Falling to freedom: The man finally pulls his hips through the gap and flies out the other side head-first

Using the lower bars to hoist himself up the escape artist gets his head and shoulders, after a little effort, through the bars in less than 20 seconds.

Onlookers on the other side of the cell stare at the man, making no attempt to either help him or stop the escape.

In the final-touch and go moment of the effort the man pulls his hips through the gap despite wearing what appears to be a bulky belt.

He strains to get the whole of his frame through the bars before popping out the other side and tumbling onto the ground below, head first. 

The video has appeared online entitled 'How to escape a from a holding cell in South Africa'.

Correctional authorities in the country may have to rethink their jail cells now that the information is out.
