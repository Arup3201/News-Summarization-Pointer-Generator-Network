Tragedy: Radha, seen here with mother Santosh, died after surgery

A baby girl who had her nose and lip bitten off by her crazed father when she would not stop crying has died.

Five-month-old Radha's condition deteriorated rapidly five days after she had had reconstructive surgery on her mauled face at the Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital in Jaipur, India.

She was being breastfed by her mother when milk entered her lungs. Medics put her on a ventilator but were unable to save her according to NDTV.com.

The child's father Bhadar Singh, a farm labourer from Siyana village of the Bikaner district in Rajasthan, will be charged with murder.

Singh, 36, launched the attack on Radha on January 26 when he returned home drunk to find his wife Santosh and his sister Saroj were applying mehendi (henna) to their hands.

He asked his wife to do some work. But she refused saying that she needed to wait for the patterns to set.

Singh flew into a rage and began to abuse and beat his wife. His older daughter Bhanwar Kanwar, three, started crying and he turned his fury on her, allegedly biting her on her back, hands and other body parts before throwing her to the ground.

The noise woke up baby Radha, who was sleeping in a neighbouring room, and when she too began to cry, her father attacked her.Â 

Both girls were initially taken to the  Prince Bijay Singh Memorial (PBSM) Hospital in Bikaner for treatment.

Doctors said that Radha would need to undergo extensive plastic surgery so she would be able to speak and eat normally. She was moved to Jaipur for specialist treatment where she died yesterday.

Singh was initially arrested
and booked under various sections of the Indian penal code (IPC) for 
causing grievous hurt with dangerous means, which provide for a sentence
ranging from 10 years in jail up to life imprisonment.

The charge is expected to be amended to murder. His wife has been thrown out of the family home by his parents.
