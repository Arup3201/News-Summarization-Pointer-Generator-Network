Southampton will ask Tottenham Hotspur to include Andros Townsend or Harry Kane in any deal for Jay Rodriguez.

Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino wants to sign Rodriguez in January as he looks to bolster his misfiring strike force.

The Saints want to keep hold of the England international - who hasn’t played since April due to a serious knee injury - and have offered the former Burnley forward an improved five-year deal to stay.

Rodriguez could move to White Hart Lane in January but Southampton do not want to sell him

But Rodriguez is yet to put pen to paper, casting doubt on his future at St Mary’s

He has just 18 months left on his deal and, despite wanting to keep the 25-year-old, the Saints are aware of the fact that he could agree a free transfer away from the club in a little more than 12 months time.

Spurs will test Southampton’s resolve to keep Rodriguez when the transfer window re-opens in January.

But manager Ronald Koeman wants the White Hart Lane club to include Townsend or Kane in any deal which would see Rodriguez move to London.

Koeman was interested in Townsend in the summer, and has been impressed by Kane’s performances so far this season.

Townsend is among the players Pochettino is willing to part with in January, but the Argentine is unlikely to listen to offers for Kane given his lack of options in attack.

Kane is the club’s top scorer in all competitions this season with nine goals, though his lack of game time in the Premier League has raised question marks over his role in Pochettino’s plans.

Southampton will take a similar approach should Spurs revive their interest in midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin; insisting on Townsend or Kane be part of any deal.

Morgan Schneiderlin is also wanted by Spurs but they would still want one of the two players in exchange
