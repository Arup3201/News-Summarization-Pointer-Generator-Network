The Daily Mail has been praised in court for a ‘tenacious’ investigation that smashed a million-pound MOT fraud.

Both the judge and the prosecution paid tribute to the work of the newspaper in ending a large-scale operation that put lives at risk.

Seamus Montgomery, 70, admitted  supplying fake MOT certificates in a scam that ran for at least five years.

Incredibly, despite enjoying an enviable lifestyle before his arrest, the retired accountant was given legal aid as he fought the case.

He finally admitted his guilt in a plea bargain that led to his wife, Paula, 63, being cleared of similar charges.

Montgomery was sentenced to two years in jail, suspended for two years, at Chelmsford Crown Court.

It may never be known how many  people were injured – or even died – while behind the wheel of a vehicle given a false MoT by Montgomery.

The couple, from Tollesbury, Essex, had a £200,000 townhouse in Alvor, on the Algarve in Portugal and Montogomery would offer the service in foreign newspapers.

He was suspected of issuing about 1,000 certificates each year.

The fraud was exposed when the Mail investigation was provided with a certificate for a dangerously unroadworthy vehicle.

In 2011, we told how he would provide apparently genuine certificates – some of which were blank, others filled out – for £200. When placed under surveillance,  Montgomery was photographed discarding hundreds of records for his ‘MoT business’.

Following the disclosure, the  certificate issuing system was changed so that the green paper documents were laser-printed instead and automatically registered on a computer database.

Prosecutor Raj Joshi told the court it was a ‘sophisticated’ scam. ‘It was apparent from evidence recovered that this large-scale operation had gone back to 2005,’ he said.

‘It caused considerable harm and undermined confidence in the system of MoTs.’

When police executed a warrant on the Essex holiday home occupied by Montgomery and his wife they found 75 completed MoT  certificates and more than 75 blank documents.

Christopher Paxton, defending, said the Montgomerys, who now live in a caravan park in Penzance , Cornwall, had suffered as a result of the case and it had been a ‘great burden’ on them.

‘In the community they lived in they have lost some friends as a result of the allegations,’ he said.

‘The fall from grace has been profound.’

Recorder John Caudle said Montgomery had brought the problems on himself.

‘He could have owned up much earlier,’ he said. ‘It is regrettable to have a man aged 70 here who has succumbed to greed.’

Echoing a judge’s comments at a previous hearing, he paid tribute to how the Mail provided police with the information to smash the fraud. The prosecution said it may not have come to light otherwise.

A Legal Aid Agency spokesman said anyone facing a Crown Court trial can apply for funding and a means test ‘ensures more affluent defendants make contributions towards their costs’.
