Town hall officials have quizzed residents about their sexuality – in a survey on wheelie bins.

The questionnaire, sent by Birmingham council to thousands of homes, posed a number of mundane questions relating to recycling reward schemes, the sizes of bins and whether respective properties had adequate space to store them.

But it had a bizarre sting in the tail. One of the questions in the ‘about you’ section asked: ‘Which of the following most accurately describes your sexual orientation?’

'Mind your own business': Residents were asked about their sexuality in a questionnaire on rubbish disposal

Irrelevant: The question appeared in Birmingham City Council's survey on its wheelie bin scheme

The options available were ‘bisexual, gay man, gay woman/lesbian, heterosexual/straight, other, or prefer not to say’.

The question has not gone down well 
with the citizens of Birmingham. One of them, Dave Dixon, 34, who was 
emailed the questionnaire, said: ‘It does not ask if residents want such
bins but is very interested in their sexual orientation. Are we going 
to have different coloured bins dependent on one’s orientation?’

Cyril Mayers, 40, added: ‘What the 
hell has sexual orientation or religion got to do with wheelie bins? 
Mind your own business.’

The council responded by claiming 
that the question is one of the standard monitoring exercises to ensure 
the responses represent a cross-section of the city’s population.

Wheelie bins: Homeowners questioned what their sexual orientation had to do with their views on recycling

Secretary Eric Pickles today accused the council of ignoring repeated 
reminders from his department, as well as statutory guidance, by asking 
residents to fill out 'intrusive' questionnaires.

The question appeared in an 'about 
you' section at the end of the form e-mailed out to residents, and said:
'Which of the following most accurately describes your sexual 
orientation?'

Respondents 
were invited to select from 'bisexual, gay man, gay woman/lesbian, 
heterosexual/straight, other, or prefer not to say'.

Former Tory councillor Peter Smallbone said: 'The survey doesn't ask whether you want one [a wheelie bin], but does ask about sexual orientation.

'It's typical pointless lefty nonsense,' he said.

Resident Paul Stanley asked: 'Why do I need to answer questions about sexual orientation/ethnicity/religion when responding to a survey about wheelie bins?'.

Gaffe: Birmingham City Council said the question was included in the survey to ensure responses reflected a cross-section of the city's population

A spokesman said: 'Although we do ask those questions, as part of the effort to make the feedback as informed as possible, you will have also noticed that 'prefer not to say' is an option to every question in that part of the survey.'

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said today: 'We've repeatedly written to councils 
to remind them that local residents shouldn’t be asked to fill out 
intrusive questionnaires about their sexuality, religion and other 
personal details just because they’ve enquired about getting their bins 
emptied or joining a local library.

'Birmingham Council have repeatedly ignored this advice despite 
statutory guidance from DCLG which states that this is simply not necessary.

'At a time when taxpayers are watching their pennies this is just one 
indication of how Labour run councils like Birmingham are showing a 
complete disregard for taxpayers' money.  Clamping down on sending out 
these unnecessary documents will not only save taxpayers’ money but 
protect the privacy of residents of all backgrounds.'

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'This is yet another example of how bureaucracy and box-ticking have become all too commonplace in town halls.

'Councils must focus on providing the best value for taxpayers’ money instead of wasting their time and local residents asking irrelevant questions.'

It is not the first time the city council has been made into a laughing stock.

In 2008 the council famously printed the skyline of Birmingham, Alabama, on more than 360,000 leaflets promoting the city.

And last summer the authority spent 
thousands of pounds on a wicker statue of Jamaican Olympian Usain Bolt 
doing his famous victory pose - before fans pointed out they had got it 
the wrong way around.

And in 2010 thousands of voting cards had to be pulped after the wrong date was printed on them. It was later realised that the word 'Birmingham' was spelled incorrectly on the cards.
