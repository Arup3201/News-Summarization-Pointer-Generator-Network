Health and safety bosses have banned postmen from wearing shorts during the winter months in case they get frostbite.

More than 200 hardy postmen were told they must wear trousers as part of their uniform when working in freezing temperatures.

Postal workers said the ban was introduced after a postman fell over during last month's cold snap and grazed his leg.

The shorts ban has been introduced at the Royal Mail depot in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

But postmen said they preferred to wear shorts during their ten-mile rounds, even in the most bitter conditions, to keep their legs cool.

One worker at the depot, who asked not to be named, said angry staff members had planned to contact the Communication Workers' Union about the ban.

He said: 'We're all disgusted about it. I find wearing shorts much more comfortable as I feel more restricted in trousers and my legs do get warm.

'There's an agreement between Royal Mail and the union which stipulates the rules about uniforms and there's nothing saying you can't wear shorts.

'I'm very annoyed - I can't stand wearing trousers when I'm on the go all the time.'

Guidance: Staff said they planned to contact their union about the ban, but Royal Mail said it was only 'guidance' and has now been 'rescinded'

The ban came about when one postman slipped and grazed his leg with ice spikes that were attached to his boots for extra grip.

Royal Mail spokesman Adrian Booth said: 'Our priority is for the health and safety of our staff and risks of frostbite and chapped skin should not be taken lightly.

'Following a local incident in which a colleague was injured in a fall, we advised our staff in the Cheltenham area not to wear shorts, to reduce the risk of injury during severe local weather.

'Now weather conditions have improved, our staff have been advised that this guidance is no longer relevant.'
