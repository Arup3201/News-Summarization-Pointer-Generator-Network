Toronto's controversial Mayor Rob Ford has been released from a hospital after undergoing his first round of chemotherapy to treat  a rare form of cancer in his abdomen.

Last week Ford, 45, began aggressive chemotherapy at Mount Sinai Hospital for what has been described as a particularly 'difficult' type of cancer.

He has a malignant liposarcoma in his abdomen that has spread to his buttock and is expected receive another cycle of chemotherapy in an effort to shrink the tumor after an 18-day break. Doctors will then reassess his situation.

Last week Ford, 45, began aggressive chemotherapy at Mount Sinai Hospital for what has been described as a particularly 'difficult' and rare type of cancer

Ford's office said yesterday that he is 'resting with his family at this time'. He has been hospitalized for nearly two weeks.

Liposarcoma is an extremely rare form of cancer that affects the body's connective tissues,  like fat, blood vessels and muscles. It comprises approximately one per cent of all cancers.

In a statement, the mayor thanked staff at both Humber River Hospital and Mount Sinai for the 'exceptional level of care' he received. He also expressed gratitude to media for respecting his privacy as well as his family's.

'Most of all, Mayor Ford would like to express his gratitude for the overwhelming outpouring of support from the people of Toronto,' the statement said. 'He wishes other families who are suffering from similar circumstances all the best in their ongoing battles.'

The tumor forced Ford to do what months of scandals over drug and alcohol abuse could not - drop his bid for re-election.

Ford, who was elected mayor in 2010, has been engulfed in controversy since the Toronto Star and the U.S. website Gawker last year reported the existence of a video apparently showing the mayor inhaling from a crack pipe.

After months of denials, he finally admitted to using crack but adamantly refused to resign, even after Toronto's City Council stripped him of most of his powers.

A stream of revelations of erratic behavior, public drunkenness - and a report of another crack video - finally prompted him to enter rehab earlier this year. He returned to work and campaigning in June.

The severity of his prognosis following his sudden admission to hospital on September 10 forced Ford to withdraw from Toronto's mayoral race. He asked his brother, Doug, to run in his place.

Before he began treatment, the mayor released an audio statement from his hospital room urging his supporters to vote for his brother.

‘I'm encouraging my brother to jump into this race, wholeheartedly, right now,’ said Ford in the three-minute statement from the hospital. ‘You, the people of Toronto, have been with me since Day One. Now I ask you to throw your support behind Doug.’

'In a few hours, I will begin my chemotherapy,' he continued. 'Then I will spend the next little while with my family, focused on getting better,' he said, adding that he would return strong for his family and his city.

‘With the love and support of my family, my friends, and the people of Toronto - I know I will beat this terrible disease,’ he said.

Ford then turned his attention to the mayoral race, touting his brother as a man who loves Toronto, who has been fighting for its citizens and who is now prepared to 'carry the torch' for him.

'When the people get to know Doug as I do they will see a man who cares, a man with vision, a man with integrity and determination,' Ford said.

He concluded the message by thanking his wife for being by his side and encouraging other people battling cancer to 'never, ever give up'.

Doug Ford, who has been his brother's most aggressive defender, is expected to face an uphill battle against two other major candidates in the mayoral election. He hasn't started campaigning since he announced he was entering the race.

Ford's doctor, Dr Zane Cohen, has said his cancer makes up only about one per cent of all cancers but said he was optimistic about Ford's treatment because they have many experts in sarcoma at the hospital.

He revealed that Ford will get two cycles of chemotherapy over the next 40 days in an effort to shrink the tumor, and then they'll assess. He said surgery may or may not be necessary.

The tumor is about five by five inches and is about two or three years old. It has not spread to organs, he said.
