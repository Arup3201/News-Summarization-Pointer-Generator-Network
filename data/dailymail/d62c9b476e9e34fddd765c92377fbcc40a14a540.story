Strutting along a hospital corridor, naked from the waist up, a jealous husband heads for the intensive care ward where his wife works.

Moments after this image was captured on CCTV, drug addict Royston Jones launched a savage attack on nurse Claire Jones in front of seven critically-ill patients she was treating.

The jobless thug, convinced she was having an affair, repeatedly shouted ‘die’ as he tried to strangle her. He also claimed he was carrying a grenade. 

Caught: CCTV footage released today by police (above) shows Royston Jones, naked from the waist-up, making his way into the hospital where he attacked wife Claire in front of seven patients she was treating

Chilling: The 39-year-old was seen wandering the halls of the Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales, before entering the ward where his wife worked. Jones shouted 'die' while strangling her

Dangerous: Jones is seen entering one of the rooms in the hospital before the vicious attack . He was described to the court as being a 'jealous, possessive and aggressive man'

Her colleagues heroically managed to stop the attack, though the nurse was left unconscious. 

One of them hit Jones, 39, with a chair while a consultant anaesthetist was kneed in the face in the fight to rescue the nurse.

Prosecutor Michael Jones told Newport Crown Court: ‘He was a jealous, possessive and aggressive man who was convinced his estranged wife was in another relationship.’

Jones arrived at Nevill Hall hospital in Abergavenny, South Wales, where he knocked his 9 stone wife to the floor and was lying on top of her. 

Jealous: Jones, right, was found guilty of attempted murder at Newport Crown Court today. He had become convinced his wife Claire, left outside court last week, was having an affair

Saved: An unconscious Mrs Jones was only saved after her 'heroic' colleagues at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales, hit him with a chair and managed to drag him off

Mr Jones said: ‘He had his hands around her throat and there’s no doubt he was trying to kill her.

'Were it not for the heroic intervention of staff at that hospital, he would undoubtedly have succeeded.’

Mrs Jones was dragged into another room by staff but her husband came after her and put her in a headlock. She then blacked out. 

The mother of three, who had separated from Jones, said: ‘He was like a man possessed. All he said to me was “You’ve done it now.” And I said: “What have I done?”.’

She was taken to the A&E unit where she was treated for a swollen neck and throat, elbow and back injuries. She later told police that she was not in a relationship when she was attacked.

Hospital porters managed to restrain Jones before police arrived to handcuff him. He told officers: ‘I’ll do two years for this. The court better not let me out or I’ll finish the job.’

Jones, of Brynmawr, Gwent, had a history of drug abuse – and had taken drugs that day. He was convicted of attempted murder and remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on February 20.
