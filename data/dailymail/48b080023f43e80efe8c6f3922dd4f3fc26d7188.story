Lord Mountbatten, pictured, the Queen's cousin, died in 1979 after the IRA hid a bomb on his fishing boat, killing him and three others 

The radio comedy would have marked a comeback for Boyle, who quit the BBC show Mock the Week five years ago, and had a segment from Comic Relief in 2013 axed.

But it is thought that after BBC executives found the pilot show included jokes about the death of Lord Mountbatten, the Queen's cousin, who died when the IRA hid a bomb on his fishing boat in 1979, the show was scrapped.

Mr Boyle, 42, told the Sunday Mirror: 'They didn't commission it because we made a joke about the assassination of Lord Mountbatten.'

A BBC insider added that the show was deemed 'too risky' and 'controversial'.

Boyle (far right) made his name on panel show Mock the Week, but quit the programme in 2009 claiming he was bored 

Boyle last appeared on the BBC in 2009, when he left satirical panel game claiming he was ‘bored’.

He caused uproar during his stint at the corporation when viewers complained a joke about the Queen was ‘sexist’ and ‘ageist’, but the BBC Trust decided he had not breached its guidelines and he was not fired.

Frankie Boyle has become known for his controversial style of humour after appearing on popular panel shows including Mock the Week and Have I Got News For You.

In 2008, the BBC received complaints after he made a joke regarding the appearance of Olympic swimming champion Rebecca Adlington, with the corporation admitting the jokes were humiliating.

Months later he also courted controversy after making a tasteless joke about the Queen, which was deemed 'sexist' and 'ageist'.

Two years later both Katie Price and Peter Andre said they were disgusted and sickened after he made jokes about Miss Price's disable son Harvey.

Then in 2012, he was axed from a BBC Comic Relief broadcast after saying he hoped the Queen had died before her Diamond Jubilee.

In 2013, BBC bosses were forced to axe Boyle from a Comic Relief broadcast after he said he wished the Queen had died before the Diamond Jubilee.

He has also attracted criticism for making controversial jokes about Katie Price's disabled son and the appearance of Olympic swimming champion Rebecca Adlington.

Meanwhile Channel 4's Head of Comedy Phil Clarke claimed the Glaswegian would not be returning to the channel in an interview last year.

But Mr Boyle hit back at TV producers while appearing on stage at the Edinburgh Festival in August.

He claimed: 'There's a layer of people whose job it is to kind of reject things that are interesting. And the trouble is, that layer is at the top.'

He added that current TV guides look like 'the entertainment programme on a f****** cruise ship'.

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'We commission pilots to help us decide which ideas should become series.

'A relatively small number make it to series, and on this occasion Blocked is not one of them.'
