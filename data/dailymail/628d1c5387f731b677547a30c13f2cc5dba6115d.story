The story of how one of the first SAS soldiers escaped from a German desert camp during the Second World War has emerged, 30 years after his death, as his medals for bravery are put up for auction.

Sergeant Ernest Thomas Lilley – known as Bob – found himself alone and unarmed behind enemy lines after a raid on German warplanes in Libya saw him separated from his comrades.

The 28-year-old sergeant was spotted by a guard but after a life-and-death struggle he overpowered his enemy and managed to escape, a brave action which awarded him the Military Medal in 1942.

Sgt Lilley’s group were operating as 
part of the Long Range Desert Group a reconnaissance and raiding unit 
of the British Army during the Second World War.

Shortly before Sgt Lilley became separated from them, the Long Range Desert Group had blown up 
numerous aircraft and spare engines in hangers and workshops in 
Benghazi.

The group was discovered by the enemy and was forced to split up. Sgt Lilley, from Wolverhampton, West
Midlands, found himself alone and unarmed inside the German camp and was trying to find a way
out when the Italian soldier saw him.

Surrounded by enemy forces, he knew an 
alarm would risk the lives of himself and his comrades, and had no choice but to quickly 
overpower and strangle the guard.

He managed to escape the camp and was reunited with his group after a 12 mile walk in the desert

Sgt Lilley had served in the SAS 
since it was first formed in 1941 and won numerous awards for his 
bravery and service during his time in the army.

November 1942 for his bravery during the raid before continuing to serve
