Friends say Pippa Middleton has decided against taking the full-time job in the U.S.

It was billed as the dream job that would make Pippa Middleton a household name in America.

But more than four months after the headline-grabbing announcement that she was to join the NBC network as a special correspondent in a £400,000 deal, she has yet to be seen on screen – and friends say she has decided against taking up a full-time job in the United States.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister has shot a series of reports for the long-running Today show in rural Wyoming, but none has seen the light of day. And it was only when The Mail on Sunday asked why the footage had not been aired that a source close to Pippa explained that she was not ready to commit to the demands of a job in the US.

The source said: ‘There were talks and Pippa did a test shoot which went really well. But for various reasons, a regular show with Pippa isn’t going to happen. Ultimately she didn’t want to commit herself to a big job in the US. She’s got a boyfriend in Geneva and her family in the UK. It was too much for her to pack up and leave them behind.

‘She will be working with the network on an ad hoc basis.

‘NBC were really pleased with the test shoot, but she is not going to be signing a major deal to be a special correspondent, which is what NBC wanted. It was Pippa’s decision not to go ahead. It’s not where she sees her future.’

One NBC insider said: ‘Pippa – or the lack of her – has been the talk of the company. Everyone is wondering what has happened to her?

‘There was all that fanfare when she went off to Wyoming, and the word then was that she would start doing segments as a roving reporter here and occasionally appear in the studio. But there’s been nothing but silence for months. It’s clear that someone has had reservations – but whether that’s from NBC’s side or her side, who knows?

‘It seems odd that they should make such a fuss of her and be so public and then go so silent.

‘Normally, after a big build-up like that, you’d get the talent on air fast and give her a big push. It doesn’t feel right at all.’

In Wyoming, Pippa donned tight jeans, a flannel shirt and cowboy boots to twirl on the dance floor of a Western bar, rode a horse in the shadow of the Teton mountains, and visited tourist sights in a cowboy town.

Interviewees were told the story would air within about ten days of the shoot last November – but have been left disappointed.

‘We’re wondering what happened to the report,’ says Jim Waldrop, manager of the Wort Hotel in Jackson Hole, where Pippa filmed. ‘I contacted the producer, but they don’t have any information about when it might air.’

Angus Thuerman, former editor of the Jackson Hole News & Guide, added: ‘I was told it was like a pilot episode, an experiment to see how she did. She seemed quite at home, relaxed and enjoying herself.’

Novelist Nanci Turner Steveson, who attended Pippa’s filming session, says: ‘Pippa seemed tiny and sweet, but maybe a bit overwhelmed There were so many people there – two or three cameramen, producers, sound technicians and bodyguards, all on a fairly small dance floor, dancing to the band One Ton Pig. A cowboy taught her to dance a two-step and she picked it up pretty quickly. But NBC seemed to be making a lot of fuss over a very small story.’

Chris Koch, 66, a regular at the Silver Dollar bar, said: ‘I was asked by NBC if I’d be filmed dancing with Pippa Middleton. I had no idea who she is. 

My daughter told me, “She’s Kate Middleton’s sister!” and I said: “Who’s she?” I don’t know what happened to the Today story, and I don’t much care – I don’t have a TV.’

Pippa’s NBC deal was initially touted as ‘provisional’, although the network has a history of signing those related to the great and the good. Other NBC correspondents have included Sarah Ferguson, Bill Clinton’s daughter Chelsea, and Princess Diana’s brother Charles Spencer.

The abortive American TV career is another false start for Pippa, after her party-planning book Celebrate and column for the Daily Telegraph both flopped.
