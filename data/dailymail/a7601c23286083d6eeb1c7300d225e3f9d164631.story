Officials at a Massachusetts college are investigating anonymous Facebook postings in which female students claimed they experienced abusive behavior at the hands of fraternity members.

Three women attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute wrote online that while they were having sex with a members of a fraternity, other members burst into the room and poured water on them or threw ice and pudding at them.

The serious incidents were reported onto a Facebook page called WPI Confessions which allows past and present students to reveal secrets online without fear of identification.

Allegations: Anonymous claims made by women that they were abused by fraternity brothers while having sex are being investigated by WPI in Massachusetts

While the posts have not been verified and do not even reveal where or at which fraternity they occurred at - college officials have said they are taking them very seriously.

'Such posts are deeply disturbing — not only because they allege that such vile acts may have taken place at the hands of some of our own community members, but because these posts offer a warped reflection of the values of this university and the vast majority of its citizens,' the college’s interim president, Philip B. Ryan, said in a letter to the campus community last week and reported in the Boston Globe.

The accusatory posts have been removed from the page, but the school of 4,000 students has launched an investigation as they seek to find out which fraternity was involved.

The president of the campus Interfraternity Council, Elliott Wiegman said if true, this behavior 'does not have a place in the WPI fraternity community.'

The school has also urged anyone with any details to come forward and to contact campus police, or the dean of students.

Some who commented on the postings questioned whether WPI 'condoned a culture of violence' - which the school rejected.

Investigation: WPI's Dean of Students Philip Clay told FOX 25 that the administration was contacted by students that were so concerned about the anonymous posts and the comments that followed, they felt something had to be done

'The message is not only inaccurate, but is dangerously wrong to send to anyone who may feel threatened, or worse, violated.'

Confession pages are common at many college campuses and many have caused controversy.

In October a Boston College student went through disciplinary procedures after he wrote on a Web page that he raped three women while attending the school.

He turned himself in and admitted his claim was a terrible lie - which was later confirmed.

However, Clay said that regardless of whether these allegations were true - a culture must exist at WPI where students can come forward.

'If you’re going to change the campus culture, you need to have an open dialogue,' Clay said.
