David de Gea has won Manchester United's Player of the Month award for a second consecutive month after impressing again during November.

Despite receiving criticism early in his United career, the 24-year-old has won the award more times than any other player since his arrival in 2011 - being named United's best player on seven separate occasions. 

De Gea collected clean sheets against Crystal Palace and Hull City and produced exceptional performances against Arsenal and Manchester City to claim the award - and has already impressed in December with several match saving stops against Stoke last week.

The Spain international thanked ManUtd.com fans for voting for him as he collected the award at the club's Aon Training Complex after beating the likes of Wayne Rooney and Marouane Fellaini in the official website's poll.

Speaking to MUTV, Spanish compatriot Juan Mata praised his good friend: 'He's been unbelievable. I remember against Everton [in October], he saved the game for us, and he was also great against Arsenal and City.

'He's in terrific form, but this is always the case, he's a great goalkeeper. Big goalkeepers appear when you need them, and that's what he is doing.'
