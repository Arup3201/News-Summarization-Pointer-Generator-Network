An 88-year-old veteran left furious after a known prostitute was banned from his sheltered accommodation punched the council worker who stopped her visits, a court has heard.

Former soldier Allan Thipthorpe was livid after officials secured an ASBO stopping Terri-Lee Pearce, 31, from visiting his room and says they are just 'jealous'.

Swindon Borough Council says the ban was imposed for his own safety after they claimed he spent £5,000 of his savings paying her.

But Mr Thipthorpe, who insists she is also his 'carer', has been charged with assault after being caught on CCTV punching council solicitor Francis Maples.

The pensioner will also appear as a defence witness when Pearce goes on trial this summer accused of breaching the ASBO by continuing to visit him.

He said: 'This is just a load of nastiness - the council don't want you to enjoy yourself. I can do what I like, it's my money.

'It's jealousy. She's young and she's got nice legs.

'I've not got long to go, have I? I'm still attracted to ladies.

'I got that young girl to try to do me a job as, you know, my carer. I think I'm entitled to that.'

The prostitute says she gave up sex work two years ago and agreed to be Mr Thipthorpe's carer after they met in a cafe.

But the police and council responded to complaints from residents at Elizabeth House in Swindon, where Mr Thipthorpe lives.

Other residents have said they are 'alarmed and distressed' by her presence and one elderly lady is so terrified she locks her doors and windows whenever she is there.

At Swindon Magistrates Court last July, Pearce admitted she had been with Allan when he had made several large cash withdrawals but claimed they were as payment for her services as a carer.

A judge imposed an indefinite ASBO banning Pearce from going near the OAP or entering any of the 32 council-run sheltered housing schemes in the town.

Mr Thipthorpe has now been before the same court over the assault,

Rob Ross, defending, told the court: 'You'll probably be aware of Mr Thipthorpe.

'He's an 88-year-old man involved in Asbo proceedings when a young lady was made an Asbo in relation to not seeing him.

'He objected to that and the long and short of it is he ended up hitting Mr Maples.'

Mr Ross told the court his client had admitted the assault in police a interview and would not be contesting the offence.

He added: 'I would ask the crown why it's necessary to leave an 88-year-old man with a record, why no mind was given to cautioning him?'

District Judge Simon Cooper agreed to adjourn the case to May 28 for the caution to be issued, but warned the prosecution would go ahead if no action was taken.

In a separate development, Pearce appeared at Swindon Crown Court this week accused of twice breaching her ASBO in February.

The court heard that Allan will appear as a defence witness. The case was adjourned until August 7 at Chippenham Magistrates Court, which has wheelchair access.

In 2004 Pearce was given a three-year ASBO banning her from any of the 'red light' areas of Swindon.
