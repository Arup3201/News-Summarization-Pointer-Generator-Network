Facebook has banned an advert featuring a father's fundraising photo of his young son awaiting heart transplant saying it is 'too graphic.'

Hudson, who is nearly two months, has the heart disease cardiomyopathy and desperately needs a heart transplant to survive.

His father Kevin Bond posted the photo of his son on a Facebook page called 'Hudson's Heart' to raise awareness and money for medical costs.

But when Mr Bond, a photographer based out of North Carolina, tried to advertise the page, the social media giant rejected the post citing the photo which accompanied the post as not adhering to their guidelines and being either 'scary, gory or sensational, and evokes a negative response.'

The social media giant's response both upset and angered Mr Bond and wrote on his Facebook page: 'What is offensive about this picture of my Son? 

'In Classic Facebook fashion the link they provided to appeal this decision doesn't work, and all efforts to contact them have failed.

'Facebook you should be ashamed of yourself. 

'Of all the garbage you endlessly pedal over the Internet, a picture of my Son is where you draw the line? Disgusting.'

Following a backlash the site has now apologised to the media for its actions, but Mr Bond says that they have yet to contact him directly.

'The ad was time sensitive. Reversing their decision days later fixes nothing,' he says.

'Further, the company still hasn't contacted me directly. Had I not read their half-hearted apology on the media I'd have no idea it existed.'

In a statement Facebook said: 'This was a mistake on our part, and the ad has been re-approved. We apologize for any inconvenience this caused the family. 

Mr Bond added: 'I read Facebook's response on media outlets last night. They apologized for the inconvenience this caused my family.

'Inconvenience was never an issue. Having my beautiful son compared to dismembered bodies, vampires, zombies, etc hurt me, and my family.'

'In an effort to get the word out about Hudson I occasionally pay a small amount to boost posts here on Hudson's Heart,' he posted on the fundraising Facebook page.

'Yesterday Facebook refused my $20 (£12.50) boost.' 

Hudson is currently at Duke Children's Hospital, where a device called a Berlin heart has been fitted which is helping keep him alive while he waits for a donor organ to become available. 

Speaking to ABC11 Mr Bond said: 'I don't like to think of the odds in a negative way - I think he's going to make it.' 

Cardiomyopathy is a general term for diseases of the heart muscle. 

It is when the walls of the heart chambers have become stretched, thickened or stiff, affecting the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. 

Earlier this week Facebook refused to remove a video of a kitten allegedly being doused in petrol and set on fire because the footage does not breach any of the social network's rules.

In the shocking clip, two unidentified men can be seen apparently torturing a young kitten by stuffing it into a bucket, pouring flammable liquid over the animal and setting it on fire.

More than 14,000 users have commented on the clip - many expressing their disgust - but despite complaints, Facebook has not removed the two minute film.
