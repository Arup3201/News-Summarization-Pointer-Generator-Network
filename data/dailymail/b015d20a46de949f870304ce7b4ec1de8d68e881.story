An anti-wrinkle cream said to be so effective it has convinced women not to have cosmetic surgery is going on sale this week.

During tests it was said to have reduced the signs of ageing in just seven days.

That could explain why 60,000 are said to have signed up for it on waiting lists.

'Miracle' ingredient: Avon says A-F33 stops the slowdown in production of proteins that causes us to develop lines  and wrinkles

Avon, which is selling the cream for £30, says it contains an ingredient that boosts production of collagen and elastin, which give skin its youthful plumpness and elasticity.

As we age, production of these proteins  rapidly slows, leaving us to develop lines  and wrinkles. 

Avon says A-F33, the cream’s ‘miracle’ ingredient, steps in to stop this slowdown.

In tests, 69 women aged between 35 and 59 used the Anew Clinical Pro Line Corrector Treatment cream twice a day for 11 weeks. All claimed their wrinkles had been reduced, with some improvements noticeable in a week.

Some even decided against cosmetic surgery after using it, the firm said.

Dermatologists used a 3D imaging camera to look at the skin’s response and claimed the cream had thickened the epidermis – the outer layer of the skin. Another test on skin cells suggested they expressed more collagen and elastin after being treated with the cream.

Samantha Bunting, a London cosmetic dermatologist who was not involved in the study, said: ‘It seems to deliver the kind of results I’m unaccustomed to seeing with other mass skincare brands.

‘It has great potential to work with other proven ingredients like vitamin-A derivatives and vitamin C, making this potentially one of the most exciting breakthroughs I’ve seen in recent years.’

A-F33, which stands for Amino Fill 33, is a modified protein discovered by scientists in Princeton, US, and licensed to Avon.

Dr Bunting said: ‘Loss of collagen occurs as we age, leading to a loss of firmness and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. 

‘There are a number of ways to lose collagen – one important one is the failure of immature collagen strands to properly bond together into “ropes”. If this doesn’t happen properly the non-useful collagen piles up, doing nothing and then gets broken down. 

‘This happens as we get older.  A-F33 seems to stimulate this process, unblocking this failure in the assembly line, so skin behaves more youthfully.’

Anthony Gonzalez from Avon’s research and development department said the ingredient had the power to change the way women look after their skin.

‘A-F33 is potentially as game changing in the fight against wrinkles as alpha hydroxyl acids (AHAs) and Retinol were in the 1990s,’ he said.

The cream goes on sale on the Avon website on Friday or is available from the company’s famous Avon ladies. Fans include actress Anna Friel, 36, who said she noticed ‘an immediate difference to my skin which appeared smoother with a fabulous glow to it’.
