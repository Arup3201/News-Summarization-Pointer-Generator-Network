A boy aged five was hit by a car travelling at 30mph – and, incredibly, it was the car that came off worse.

Doctors believe Jayden Channell survived because he has highly-flexible joints which are thought to have helped his body absorb the impact.

While the car was left dented, Jayden was able to stand up immediately and walk away with only grazes and a bump to his head despite bouncing off the bonnet and being sent flying.

'He looked like a rag doll': Jayden Channell, five, was sent flying into the air after being hit by a car outside his home in Essex - but escaped unscathed thanks to a condition called hypermobility syndrome

Relief: Smiling Jayden, pictured with his mother Samantha Taplin, sustained barely a scratch when he was hit by the car on Bank Holiday Monday

Jayden has hypermobility syndrome, 
which means he is double-jointed. The collagen in his skin and ligaments
is weaker than normal, making his joints looser and more stretchy so 
that they can extend further than usual.

His mother Samantha Taplin, 26, said: ‘If that had been an ordinary child there is no way they would have survived.

‘The doctors couldn’t believe he had 
been hit by a car and his  condition had saved his life. He actually 
left dents in the car, but all he had was a bump on his head and a 
graze.’

Jayden was crossing the road as his 
family loaded up their car at their home in Southend ready for a day out
on Bank Holiday Monday when he was struck.

His mother watched in horror as he flew into the air off the bonnet before smashing into the ground.

He was taken to hospital where he was given a clean bill of health and allowed home straight away.

Miss Taplin said: ‘The road is very narrow and there are cars parked either side.

‘One minute there was nothing coming and the next this car appeared out of nowhere just as Jayden went to cross.

‘He hit the bonnet and got thrown up 
the road. His body looked like a rag doll, but he just jumped up and ran
to the pavement. The car was doing about 30mph, but he just got right 
up. It was terrible watching it. There was nothing I could do to stop it
as it all happened so quickly.

Astonishing: The schoolboy, five, was rushed to hospital after being hit by the car - but only sustained a small graze and a bump on his head

‘It was horrible though, every time I closed my eyes that night I could see it happen in my head.’

Miss Taplin, who is now  campaigning 
for speed bumps along the road, added: ‘Someone was watching over him 
that  day, but things could be so  much different.’

While Jayden’s condition means that he
can move his limbs into positions that others would find impossible, it
can cause fatigue and long-term pain and he receives regular specialist
care.
