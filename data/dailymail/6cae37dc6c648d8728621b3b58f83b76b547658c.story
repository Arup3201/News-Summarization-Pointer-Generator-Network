Ryanair is to introduce ‘family-friendly’ deals and discounts as it tries to win back passengers put off by its ‘mistakes’ and reputation for poor customer service.

The airline’s flamboyant boss Michael O’Leary has apologised for his airline’s ‘over-abrupt culture’ and pledged to change it.

He said strict hand-luggage restrictions would be relaxed to allow ‘small ladies’ handbags’ and airport shopping to be carried onto the plane in addition to the stated allowance.

Families will be also able to book seats together and pool their luggage allowances, under plans to be announced officially next month.

Mr O’Leary also pledged not to overly penalise passengers who make a ‘genuine mistake’ – such as forgetting to bring their boarding card, which often results in a £70 charge to reprint them.

Mr O’Leary said that Ryanair was ‘evolving’ and becoming more ‘sophisticated’.

He added: ‘In the past we have said, “That’s the policy – go to hell”. That culture needs  to evolve.’

Yesterday Mr O'Leary Ryanair was bombarded on Twitter today after agreeing to host a question-and-answer session from customers.

The boss posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets.

He was using the stunt as part of a drive to improve the public image of the airline, which was recently voted worst of 100 biggest brands by Which? readers.

One Twitter user, Matt Trilby asked him: 'Does anyone in your organisation have any experience of running an airline?'

Andy McGeady joked: 'How much will Michael charge per reply? And are you charging me to send this tweet?'
