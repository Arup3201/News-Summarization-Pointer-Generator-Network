Pep Guardiola is normally one of football's cooler customers but has a habit of letting his frustrations boil over when things don't go his way - particularly when he is in Manchester.

The Bayern Munich manager was visibly-upset after the 3-2 defeat by Manchester City - just as he was following a 1-1 draw against United at Old Trafford in April - and swore during his post-match press conference.

'I am sad for the players, they didn't deserve to lose,' Guardiola said. 'If we lose and we play s***, then we play s***.

'And if the opponent is better you just have to shake hands and say congratulations. So I am sad for the players because they didn't deserve to lose. They played amazingly. I am so sad.'

Guardiola went on to say that the defeat could not have come at a better time for Bayern, insisting his side would learn from the mistakes that led to a first defeat since August.

Munich had already secured top spot in Champions League Group E before their trip to Manchester but were 2-1 ahead and still in control of the contest until the 85th minute despite playing with 10 men for most of the match.

However, individual mistakes gifted two goals to the home side in the dying minutes as the English champions rallied for an unexpected victory.

'It is good that this happened here,' said Guardiola, who saw Sergio Aguero score all three goals against his usually well-drilled defence - the Argentine's hat-trick matches the total amount of goals Bayern have shipped in 12 Bundesliga games this season.

'This will be a lesson for us because if something like that happens in the round of 16 or the quarter-finals then you are out of the competition,' the Spaniard added.

Bayern's only previous loss this season was against Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup in August, having since stretched their unbeaten run to 18 games.

'We lost and if we lose playing badly, then that is not good. But the team did not deserve to lose. I am very proud of my players.' Guardiola said.

'Playing for 70 minutes with 10 men against the English champions takes a lot of effort. We had a lot of personality.'

'Twice we lose the ball and twice we were punished,' winger Arjen Robben lamented. 'It is a real shame because we played really well. We deserved more.'

'We can be proud of ourselves because we did not hide. We were strong although we were a man less.'
