A mother-of-two pretended she was raising money on behalf of a family whose toddler died when he tumbled out of a car.

Sarah Moore, 23, has been imprisoned for 30 months after duping people she was helping the family of Levi Brailsford, two, pay for a gravestone.

The toddler fell from his grandmother’s moving car on May 11 after undoing his own car seat and opening the door, an inquest heard on Tuesday.

Clutching a newspaper article of the tragedy, Moore - who has a history of abusing drugs - said she was collecting on behalf of the family.

On Thursday, at Bristol Crown Court, 
Moore, from Hartcliffe, pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation 
in which she duped 16 people out of £34 total in cash.

Moore, who has a two-year-old and a 
five-year-old chose to enter her guilty pleas and immediately leave the 
courtroom because she could not face hearing again what she had done.

Levi
Brailsford’s grandmother heard the click of the door handle on her 
black Volvo 4x4 as she drove across a roundabout in Bristol but as she 
tried to pull over, the door opened and he tumbled out of the vehicle.

He suffered serious head injuries and was taken to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where his death was confirmed.

A moving statement from Levi’s father Kevin Brailsford was read in court by prosecutor Peter Coombe.

Mr Brailsford spoke of his 'anger' at hearing just a few days before Levi’s funeral that a female was going door to door collecting on his behalf.

Mr Brailsford said: 'I knew she was collecting money for herself of the back of this tragic incident. I didn’t think it was possible for someone to sink so low.

'She is a con artist who preyed on people's good nature.

'Even at the funeral my mind kept wandering to this female who was collecting money in my boy’s memory while I was burying him.'

Mr
Coombe told the court that Moore would prey on people, often 
pensioners, in their homes and in the street asking for donations.

After arrest she told police she was doing it genuinely for a friend because she had wanted to 'give something back'.

Despite dying her hair before a police ID parade she was picked out by several of her victims.

The court heard whilst on bail for the fraud offences she acted as a 'honey trap' where she lured 'punters' to an area where they were robbed by two men.

She pleaded guilty to one count of robbery on August 20.

Mr Coombe said her victim had been befriended at 11.30pm and then approached by two men who ordered him to the floor threatening they would kill him before taking his wallet and mobile phone.

The man later saw the defendant with the men and phoned police. After her arrest she was found to have cash in sterling and euros belonging to the victim in her bra.

Mr Coombe said Moore had previous offences of theft, shoplifting and assaulting a police officer.

Tabitha Macfarlane, defending, conceded there was little she could say to mitigate the devastating impact her client’s actions must have had on the Brailsford family.

She said: 'She is truly ashamed.'

Miss Macfarlane said Moore had an unhappy past but was now at 'rock bottom' after getting in with the wrong crowd and abusing drugs.

Judge Martin Picton said: 'She chose to utilise a terrible tragedy afforded to this family in the area they lived to raise money for herself through lying. The effect on this poor boy’s family has been huge.

'They were suffering enormously and they did not need this to be added to the volume of awful suffering they were going through. I have desperate sympathy for them.'

'In the context of the wider community her actions has an effect on the belief of good in people and the willingness to give to charity that underpins community life.'

Moore, was jailed for 20 months for robbery and 10 months consecutive for fraud - a total of 30 months.
