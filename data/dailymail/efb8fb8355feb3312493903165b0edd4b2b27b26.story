A disgraced headteacher who spent more than £30,000 of public funds on extravagant parties and hotel rooms - including a £7,000 bill for her 50th birthday party - could be banned from the classroom for life.

Jo Shuter claimed on school expenses for fancy meals, unexplained taxi rides and overnight conferences at plush hotels while she was in charge of Quintin Kynaston Academy School in Marlborough Hill, north London.

The teacher - who was named headteacher of the year in 2007 - resigned from her post last year while the government launched a probe into her 'inappropriate' use of school funds.

Jo Shuter could be given a lifetime ban on teaching children unsupervised after claiming tens of thousands of pounds on school expenses

Now a National College for Teaching 
and Leadership panel is deciding whether to ban Shuter from teaching unsupervised for life, after she pleaded guilty to 
unacceptable professional conduct.

The hearing, taking place this week in Coventry, follows the investigation last year by the Department for Education, which found Shuter had used school funds for 'inappropriate purposes' - including her £6,957 birthday bash.

The staggering bill included money spent on catering, alcohol, food, party lights and 'landscaping' - as well as extra pay for the staff's time. That money was not paid back for more than a year.

The teacher - who was awarded a CBE in 2010 for services to teaching -  also claimed on expenses for posh dinners, personal taxi rides and nearly £3,500 in flowers.

Under her expenses, Shuter also paid £4,410 for an event at the five-star Landmark hotel, as well as £8,269 for an overnight stay at the Grove Hotel, Hertfordshire.

She also charged her and her children's mobile phone bills back to the school and used the school’s account to spend £1579 on chairs - which were delivered to her home.

Shuter, who has previously been named as headteacher of the year, resigned from her post at The Quintin Kynaston school after her string of false expenses claims came to light

The report, published last year, also raised 'a number of issues relating to the employment of family members'.

Westminster Council, which ran the school until 2008, referred Shuter to the regulatory body because it said the matter was 'too serious' not to take it further. She later resigned.

But just months later, Shuter - who was 
earning at least £170,000 in her previous post - landed herself another 
high-flying job at King Solomon High School in Barkingside, Essex, where
 she is still headteacher.

Shuter resigned from her post when the expenses allegations came to light but landed a job at the helm of another school in Essex last September

An investigation by the Department for Education last year found Shuter had used the school funds for 'inappropriate purposes'

Andrew Christie, director of children’s services at Westminster Council, said: 'Following the governors’ investigation and the report by the Department for Education, we felt that this matter was too serious not to take it any further.'

He added: 'We referred this case to the National College for Teaching and Leadership, the responsible professional body, for an independent review and to determine if further action could or should be taken.

'We expect very high standards from teachers and headteachers in Westminster.

'We also believe we have a duty of care for standards in the teaching profession as a whole, and will always do what we can to uphold these standards.'

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: 'This case has been before a National College for Teaching and Leadership professional conduct panel. A decision will be taken shortly.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said an allegation of fraud and false accounting at the school was reported to the force in September 2012.

He said no arrests had been made but that police continued to investigate the allegations.

The panel is expected to make a decision on Shuter's future later this week.
