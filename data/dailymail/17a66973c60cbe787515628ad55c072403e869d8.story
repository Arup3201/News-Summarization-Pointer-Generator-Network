A man held on suspicion of attempting to kidnap a three-year-old British girl as she enjoyed a family holiday has been released on police bail.

The child was led away from her parents and taken down an alleyway while her family looked round a shopping centre in the Spanish island resort of Lanzarote.

The girl's father shouted out and ran up to his daughter, pulling her away from the man who then left the scene.

A 62-year-old man from London was 
arrested by police on Wednesday on suspicion of the attempted
kidnap of the child, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, following a media appeal.

Location: A family from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, were on holiday in Costa Teguise when a man, believed to be British, attempted to kidnap the girl in a shop

Police confirmed today that he has been released on bail until next month.

The
incident has chilling similarities to the disappearance of 
three-year-old Madeleine McCann, who went missing from her apartment in 
Portugal in 2007 and has never been seen since.

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'A 62-year-old man from London arrested in connection with an attempted kidnap in Lanzarote has been released on police bail.

'The man has been bailed to return to Milton Keynes Police Station in early May.

'The arrest is in connection with an incident in the resort of Costa Teguise on Monday 30 January, when a three-year-old girl was led away from her family in a shopping centre.'

The British girl's family were on the beach a short 
time after the shopping centre incident and saw the same man, who spoke fluent English, sitting 
between some rocks and acting suspiciously.

The victimâ€™s father confronted the suspect, but he left before police arrived. But the quick-thinking family took photos of the man in an attempt to identify him.

The middle-aged man was described as white, with pasty skin, of 
stocky build with broad shoulders.

He was around 5ft 8ins to 5ft 9ins tall, 40 to 55 years old, with short dark hair and a dark moustache.

The incident happened on January
30 last year, but police said the delay in
issuing the pictures was due to Spanish police having to exhaust their 
investigation before the appeal to find the man could move to Britain.

A near six-year search for Madeleine 
has yet to solve the mystery of her disappearance from the Algarve 
resort of Praia da Luiz on May 3, 2007.

There
have been dozens of alleged sightings and leads over the years, but 
nothing has come close to establishing whether she is alive or dead.

In the latest development last month, detectives believe a team of British cleaners may hold the key to her whereabouts.

Owners
of apartments in the Portuguese holiday complex where Maddie and her 
parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were staying when she vanished have been
asked about cleaners in the area who had a white van.

One
property owner said police told him they are looking for a group of six
to eight British cleaners who drove around the Praia da Luz area in a 
white van, working in holiday apartments.

Operation Grange was set up by the 
Metropolitan Police two years ago at the request of Prime Minister David
Cameron following a plea by Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry, of 
Rothley, Leicestershire.
