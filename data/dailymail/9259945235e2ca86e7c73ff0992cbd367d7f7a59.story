A major overhaul is needed to curb  migrants’ access to British benefits, a Government review has concluded.

The report finds growing concern among Britons about access to the welfare state by the hundreds of thousands of arrivals from Europe taking advantage of EU free movement rules.    

If the system is not urgently reformed it could ‘significantly undermine’ public support for freedom of movement, it concludes.

The report, published today, cites clear evidence that EU migration has put pressure on public services such as the NHS and schools.

And it concludes that EU court rulings have allowed an explosion in illegal activity such as fake passports and sham marriages by non-EU migrants trying to live and work in Britain.

The report, which is based on submissions from businesses, interest groups and members of the public, was due to be published earlier this year. But a Whitehall source said senior Lib Dems blocked its release because they feared it was too critical of the EU.

Pro-immigration Business Secretary Vince Cable has claimed that increases in migration are a ‘good thing’. He told the BBC he had ordered the report to be rewritten because it was ‘propagandist’.

But its final conclusions are far from comfortable for the Lib Dems as it highlights a great many problems which have resulted from mass EU migration and calls for urgent action to combat them.

It is one of a number of reports into the EU’s influence on British government and society and how it should be curtailed as part of the renegotiation of membership proposed by David Cameron ahead of a referendum in 2017.

The review found evidence of growing public opposition to mass EU migration as numbers entering the country have ballooned over the last decade.

Shifts in attitudes show the British public have gone from being two-to-one in favour of free movement in 2005 to, last year, nearly half being opposed.

It found that free movement rights have been gradually extended – in part by EU judges - far beyond the original intention of member states, and cites concerns around whether existing welfare restrictions are ‘fit for purpose’.

It points to abuse and fraud of free movement rules by non EU migrants using fake passports, and growing evidence of sham marriages being used to get EU citizenship.  

EU rules make it harder to send home even convicted criminals, and ministers must ‘respond effectively’ to concerns about criminals abusing free movement, it says.

At the same time, Britons struggle to find work overseas because other countries fail to implement EU rules on fair working properly.

The review also cites evidence that workers in low paid jobs can lose out from mass migration when the economy is weak because of competition for jobs and lower wages.

Slough Council, which has seen high levels of immigration, cited the phenomenon of the ‘Slough Shed’ where landlords put immigrant workers in sheds, garages and outhouses of the homes they own.

And the report found evidence of mass EU migration having contributed to more people living on the streets in some areas.

Number of EU migrants living in Britain from eight Eastern European states, including Poland, who joined the EU in 2004, have increased from 125,000 a year to more than 1 million in 2012. Romanian and Bulgarian nationals have increased from 20,000 to 155,000.

And more recently there has been a sharp increase in migrants from southern European countries such as Spain hit by economic difficulties – leading to a 50 per cent rise in EU migrants.

The report said: ‘The Government considers that now is an appropriate time to review the EU level rules with a view to modernisation and ensuring they are fit for purpose in the EU of today.

‘The rules have evolved beyond the original scope as the EU has evolved…weakening the ability of Member states to determine how their systems operate.’  

‘These problems are magnified by the fact that the EU of today is very different to when the rules were created.

It says that ‘without reform’ around welfare rules, ‘legitimate public concern about how EU migrants access social security…is likely to significantly undermine support for the principle of free movement.’

The report contains calls from academics and think tanks for a cap of 75,000 in the number of EU migrants allowed in every year.

Other campaign groups call for migrant workers to have to wait five years before they get full access to Britain’s benefit systems.

Another suggestion is that home countries should pay unemployment benefit for their own nationals for the first six months they live in another state.

Backbench Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris said there was not enough understanding of how mass migration had impacted on Britain.

He is co-chairman of the Fresh Start group of Tory MPs, which has drawn up a list of powers to be repatriated from Brussels.

He said: ‘With free movement comes pressure on housing, education and the NHS.

‘The government should have done this long ago, to see where these pressures can fall, and how we can better manage them.’
