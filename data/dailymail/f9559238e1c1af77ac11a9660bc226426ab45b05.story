A former soap actor has told how he transformed his body in just twelve weeks, losing 34lbs in weight and nine inches from his waist.

Scott Wright – who played stripper Sam Kingston in Coronation Street – went from being a  ‘gut bucket’ to having his dream Men’s Health body by following a strict diet and doing short-burst, high-intensity workouts.

He documented his weight loss in a series of pictures taken weekly as his body got more and more toned.

Scott Wright - who played stripper Sam Kingston in Coronation Street - went from being a  'gut bucket' to having his dream Men's Health body by following a strict diet and doing short-burst, high-intensity workouts

The pictures show how he started off with a pot belly and transformed into a muscle man.

Before getting into shape, Mr Wright would eat up to eight Kit Kat Chunky bars a day – with 218 calories in each bar, this meant he was eating 1,744 calories of chocolate a day.

He decided to make changes to his lifestyle but even as he was pumping iron and working out daily at the gym, he admits there was the occasional lapse.

Early on, he says that he cracked and ate two family-sized packs of McVities Chocolate Digestives in one 4,300 calorie binge.

However, after that he knuckled down and lost 34lbs – going down from 14st 6lb to 12st – and his waist measurement went down from 37in to just 28in.

Perhaps most startling of all was his reduction in body fat – from 23 per cent to just 3 per cent.

The 38-year-old said: ‘I looked awful before I lost the weight. I was incredibly lethargic and completely ashamed of my man boobs and pot belly.

‘I had always been proud of my body and had worked as a fitness trainer keeping stars like Kerry Katona in shape.

‘But I had let myself go big-time. Chocolate was my big weakness and I would not think twice about scoffing eight Kit Kat Chunkys in a day.

‘I’d just eat one after another, nibbling off the chocolate first before scoffing the wafer.

‘It took its toll on my body and I ended up in the worst shape of my life.’

As
 a result, at Easter, Mr Wright set himself task - get a body like a 
model by the start of the summer and record the whole painful process in
 a series of photographs.

Mr Wright believes a key factor in his 
body transformation was his daily use of Forza Supplements’ fat burning 
and recovery pills - Garcinia-C diet capsules in particular.

Now he has achieved his goal – and proudly showed off his new body.

He said: ‘I didn’t just want to look good, I wanted to look amazing.

‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw the pictures. I’d achieved all my goals and vowed that I would never get out of shape again.

‘I would have lost more weight but I’d bulked up with lots more muscle, which is heavier than fat.’

However, he admitted that it was tough cutting back on his chocolate intake.

He said: ‘I started off determined to stick rigidly to an ultra-low sugar and low fat diet.

‘I tried this approach for five days 
after which I caved in and smashed two family-sized packs of McVities 
Chocolate Digestives.

Mr Wright (pictured in Coronation Street in 2000) has now lost 34lbs - going down from 14st 6lb to 12st - and reduced his waist measurement from 37in to just 28in. He believes in that taking daily fat burning and recovery pills by Forza supplements also helped

‘It was a case of going straight back to the drawing board.

‘I can be incredibly weak-willed. My 
mind plays tricks on me and I have a constant devil on my shoulder 
telling me to do the wrong thing, “Eat this, drink that”.’

After this setback, Mr Wright stuck rigidly to a diet regime – he did two 20 minutes high intensity workouts during the week, before and after work, and ate carefully before taking a more relaxed approach at weekends.

He explained: ‘I knew I needed a slightly more realistic regime.

‘I have literally had to nurse myself through this whole thing and treat myself like an adult teaching a naughty child.

Before getting into shape, Mr Wright would eat up to eight Kit Kat Chunky bars a day - with 218 calories in each bar, this meant he was eating 1,744 calories of chocolate a day

‘I
 would eat a fairly strict diet throughout the week and then not put 
pressure on myself at weekends. If I wanted to eat crap, I would. If I 
did eat crap, I had to go to the gym or a run afterwards.

‘The key point for me was not to feel hungry. That is when I would reach for the chocolate in the past.

‘What worked for me was cutting my carbohydrate intake right down after noon and replacing it with a slightly higher fat intake – whole eggs and fattier cuts of meat.

‘I made sure I had my fruit and natural sugars in the mornings and I always ate greens a few times a day.

‘Added to this, I drank as much water as possible – between three and four litres daily, and I didn’t leave more than three hours between meals.’
