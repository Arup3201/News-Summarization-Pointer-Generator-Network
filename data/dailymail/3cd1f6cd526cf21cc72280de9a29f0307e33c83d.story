A Florida teen watching his drunk father beat his mother defended her by shooting the violent man dead.

Christopher Albano, 35, came home drunk early Wednesday morning and started hitting his wife. The 15-year-old boy rushed to her defense by grabbing a gun and shooting the violent father dead on the spot. There were two other children in the home at the time.

The boy was taken into custody last night but not arrested while police decided whether to file charges, according to multiple reports.

Forever changed: The life of this 15-year-old boy will never be the same after he shot his father dead early Wednesday morning

Police arrived at the Avalon home after the beaten woman called 911 to say her husband came home drunk and was beating her just before 2:30am, police told the Orlando Sentinel.

She told police that her son had shot the violent man dead.

The family was at a New Year's Eve party in the neighborhood before the altercation, neighbors told WESH.

It is not known if Mr Albano had previously hit the woman, but he does have a few run-ins with the law to his name. 

He was charged in 1999 with resisting arrest (non-violent) and in 2004 with drunken disorderly conduct, court records showed.

House of horrors: Neighbors say Christopher Albano also had a SWAT standoff with police in 2012

The teen was shown on multiple reports sitting on the curb crying while being consoled by others, his mother was also seen crying against the side of a police car.

Neighbors gave conflicting accounts of the family’s history.

One told WFTV there was a SWAT standoff at the home in 2012 involving Mr Albano and gun.

Another told WESH this was the first time they have seen any police officers at the home.All were shocked by the violent killing.

‘I asked ‘where did that come from?’ She says next door,’ I said ‘oh my gosh it’s gun shots,’ a neighbour told WESH. ‘They were taping off the road, there were cops behind my car with guns, it was scary.’

Ongoing: The investigation remains ongoing, police have not arrested the boy and have decided whether to press charges

‘The son grabbed the gun because maybe this has happened before,’ the neighbor continued. ‘He was beating up on his mother, so he shot him… it’s sad.’

A classmate of the shooter told WESH he is a quiet kid who never has any trouble and never gets into fights – ‘he’s just a normal kid.’

Police have not said if they will charge the boy with any crimes.

The investigation remains ongoing.
