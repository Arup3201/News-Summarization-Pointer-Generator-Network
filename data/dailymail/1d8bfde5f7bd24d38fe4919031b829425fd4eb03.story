Lukas Podolski has indicated his intention to return to Arsenal in the summer, having failed to make an impression on a loan spell at Inter Milan.

Speaking to Sport Bild, the World Cup winner said: 'The chapter is not closed with Arsenal, because there is no purchase option.

'I was the first person to clear things up in the talks with Inter and say I didn't want any kind of clause that would have let them purchase my contract rights.

'When you're on loan you never know what can happen, so at the end of the season we'll analyse things freely and decide the situation.'

Podolski was left out of Inter's squad for the Europa League and has seen his performance levels criticised by Nerazzurri coach Roberto Mancini.

The 29-year-old added: 'At Inter there have been some negative situations, but I see the bright side in all of it.

'Also, it's generally easier to criticise someone who comes on loan, as I did this winter.'

Arsenal are set to join Everton, Stoke and a Singapore Select XI team for the Barclays Asia Trophy Singapore in July 2015, which will see the Gunners return to the country for the first time since 1991 as part of their pre-season campaign.

Arsene Wenger said: 'It will be a typical English Premier League competition in Asia and we know that English football is very popular in Asia, and that's a good opportunity to show how much we respect Asia as well.

'[Strong competition] is what you're looking for, to prepare well with the right intensity in the games to have a look at everybody as well. We have young promising players who can be a name after the competition. It's a good opportunity as well for Singapore people to see these players.'
