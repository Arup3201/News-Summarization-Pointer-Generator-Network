Real Madrid and Barcelona spend hundreds of millions on world-class footballers as freely as kids buy candyfloss as the seaside.

At some stage of their careers the majority of the game’s greatest players cross the portals of the Bernabeu or the Camp Nou, in some cases both.

Cometh the latest edition of El Clasico in Madrid this Saturday, cometh the hour for plucking from the pantheons of Spain’s gigantes their most wondrous teams of all-time.

The problem with this embarrassment of riches is as much who to leave out as who to put in.

Ronaldo, the original Brazilian phenomenon, does not make it into my Barca XI.

Ronaldo, Real’s modern Portuguese marvel, is one of less than a handful of current players in both teams put together.

For every genius chosen, a maestro has to be left out.

Inevitably the Real selection is predicated on the greatest club side in history, that which won the first five European Cups with the immortal Alfredo Di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas as its axis.

Our fantasy Real Madrid and Barcelona XIs - scroll down for who we think would win this encounter 

History weighs a little less heavily on Barcelona, leaving scope for balance down the ages, yet still no room for Xavi, Iniesta or any of the other 2010 World Cup winners

Let the arguments begin.

REAL MADRID (4-4-2)

IKER CASILLAS – coming to a reluctant end now but the No 1 keeper for Real and Spain virtually since his Madrid debut at the age of 18 and the one-man saviour of transitional Real teams in several of those seasons.

CHENDO – Miguel Porlan Nogeura, as he was born, won five successive La Liga championship medals in just one of the segments of his 16 years as Madrid’s peerless right back

JOSE SANTAMARIA – the giant Uruguayan rock at the defensive heart of the European legends of the late 50s and early 60s.

FERNANDO HIERRO – the midfield enforcer turned iron-man defender who scored almost as many goals as he prevented, 127 of them in 601 appearances

JOSE ANTONIO CAMACHO – another 600-plus games man. Winner of seven La Ligas and a European Cup in 16 seasons at the Bernabeu. Far more beloved and effective than Brazil’s hit-and-miss free-kick cult left back Roberto Carlos.

Real skipper Jose Antonio Camacho (left) shakes hands with Tottenham captain Steve Perryman prior to their UEFA Cup quarter-final second leg at the Bernabeu in 1985 - the Spanish side won 1-0

CRISTIANO RONALDO – having finally de-throned Lionel Messi as world footballer of the year, Ronaldo tales his place in the legend. He does so having just scored more goals in one season than any other Madrilleno - 48 – and as he is threatening to improve on that record.

ZINEDINE ZIDANE – perhaps the finest player of his generation, probably the best French footballer ever, remembered for ever for the most sublime of all his works of art – that stupendous volley in Real’s winning of the 2002 Champions League final

ALFREDO DI STEFANO – the king above all Madrid’s princes as playmaker and goal-taker in the founding legend of the European Cup; still among the five best players of all time; anointed by most of the others in that celestial company as the most complete footballer ever

FRANCISCO (PACO) GENTO – The Third Man alongside Di Stefano and Puskas in the magnficent European Cup triumvirate. The only man to win six European Cups and 12 La Liga titles. Dynamic on the wing. Deadly in front of goal.

RAUL – Real’s all-time high scorer with 323 goals in a club record 741 games played over the 16 seasons in which he won six La Liga titles and three Champions League winners’ medals (the competition in which he is still top scorer), to become a favourite son of the Bernabeu.

FERENC PUSKAS – Hungary’s revolutionary galloping major took Spanish football by storm, scoring an astounding 242 goals, many of them created by Di Stefano, in 262 appearances for Real. The only man to score hat-tricks in two European Cup finals, the first in the historic 7-3 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in Glasgow.

BARCELONA (4-1-3-2)

ANDONI ZUBIZARRETA - Spain’s No 1 pre Casillas, and kept immaculate goal through more than 400 appearances for Barcelona, including the club’s first winning of the European Cup in 1992.

CARLES PUYOL – Barca captain supreme; played 581 games before retiring this May; led them to six La Liga titles and three Champions League glories; fearsome centre back but also a redoubtable right back and is there to help balance this defence

'The Beast', Miguel Angel Nadal (right) a fixture at the heart of the Barcelona defence for years

MIGUEL ANGEL NADAL – Not called ‘The Beast’ for nothing. Snuffed out most of the best forwards in the world through almost 500 games for Barcelona – yet as creative from the back as he was uncompromising tin the challenge.

MIGUELI – Who else to play alongside ‘The Beast’ but ‘Tarzan’, as Miguel Bernardo Blanquetti was dubbed. Another iron man with deft touch, Migueli played 620 games over 20 seasons with Barca – much of one of them with a broken collar bone in the extra-time winning of the 1979 European Cup-Winners’ Cup final.

SERGI – the perfectly balanced left-back who defended as solidly as he answered Cruyff’s crie-de-couer for Total attacking football

PEP GUARDIOLA – in his first incarnation at the Camp Nou, before filing his credentials as one of the great managers, Guardiola was the ideal midfield anchorman, reading the game as brilliantly as you would now expect, shutting down danger at its source and starting attacks

LIONEL MESSI – the brilliant Little Master, after Maradona the great Little Master. Messi has failed to place a God-like Argentinian hand on the World Cup but his electrifying runs and barrel-loads of goals have propelled Barcelona to glory in recent seasons – and himself to multiple World and European Footballer of the Year awards. Like Cristiano Ronaldo, a legend in his own time.

A legend in his own time, Lionel Messi has consistently produced barnstorming performances for Barca

DIEGO MARADONA – the second greatest footballer ever made not much more than a pit-stop in Catalonia but his virtuoso brilliance and wonder goals cannot be left out of any all-time team for which he qualifies

JOHAN CRUYFF – the genius who orchestrated Total Football for Ajax and Holland and went on to conduct Barcelona to honours as both player and manager. Another of the all-time top five who simply has to be in this line-up

Two geniuses of the Nou Camp, Johan Cruyff (left) and the Argentinian master Diego Maradona

LASLO KUBALA – sometimes known as Ladislav, this Hungarian giant of the late 40s, 50s and early 60s was to Barca what Puskas was to Real – a goal machine harnessed to magical touch with his passing. Scorer of 194 in 256 matches spanning a decade at Barcelona, he was the first striker in the world to perfect the art of bending free kicks round and over defensive walls – with that heavy old ball to boot. A forgotten hero in some quarters – but not here.

RONALDINHO – not unlike George Best, this Brazilian enigma was the best player on the planet – for a while. The ball-conjuring skills were as captivating as that beaming smile and all his four most enchanted club seasons were his gift to Barcelona, whom he insired to Champions League glory as well as La Liga titles while being twice elected World Footballer of the Year.

This leaves us with just one question to answer: Who would have won.

For my pesetas Real’s extra width plus the telepathy between di Stefano and Puskas would give them the edge in this 10-goal spectacular:

REAL MADRID 6     BARCELONA 4

Puskas (2)                           Kubala

Di Stefano                           Maradona

Raul                                    Messi

Ronaldo                              Ronaldinho

Zidane
