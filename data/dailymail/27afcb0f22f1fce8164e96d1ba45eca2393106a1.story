A married Chinese man has been ordered to pay a woman £3,000 compensation for 'violating her right to virginity' because he pretended to be single when they slept together.

The man, identified only by his surname Li, was fined and told he will have to write his younger lover an apology letter during sentencing at Pudong New Area People's Court in Shanghai yesterday.

The couple first met online five years ago but did not begin a relationship until September last year, at which Li told the woman - whose surname was given as Chen - that he was a bachelor.

The court rejected Li's claim that the couple had not had a sexual relationship and found him guilty of taking Chen's virginity by deception.

Chen met Li on an online forum several years ago, but the couple only started dating last September - at which point Li insisted he was not already in a relationship, according to the South China Daily Post.

The couple had sex for the first time during a visit to Singapore later in the year, but Li broke off the relationship shortly after they returned to China and refused to respond to any of Chen's repeated attempts to speak with him.

Frustrated by the lack of contact, Chen broke into Li's apartment in Shanghai in February this year - where she was shocked to discover he was living with wife of several years.

A month later she filed a lawsuit alleging Lu had 'violated her virginity by deception' and demanding he pay her £50,000 in compensation as well as write her a letter of apology. 

Deception: There have been several similar cases of men being ordered to pay compensation for breaching the virginity or chastity 'rights' of women  in China. While some are purely symbolic, others result in heavy fines

The Pudong New Area People's Court agreed that virginity was a civil right that must be protected, adding that having sex with Li had negatively impacted on Chen's health and reputation, but ruling that a written apology and a reduced compensation package of £3,000 is the correct punishment.

It is the first time a case arguing sexual 'rights' has been upheld in a court in Shanghai - although there was previously a similar successful trial in Fujian province.

In that instant a married man who told a woman he was single before having a one night stand with her was ordered to pay symbolic compensation of 1 yuan - roughly 10p - becuase he had violated her 'right to chastity'. He was also ordered to make a written apology.

Compensation for a breach of 'chastity rights' has also been ordered in Kunming and Shenzhen provinces, but only when the victims were virgins.
