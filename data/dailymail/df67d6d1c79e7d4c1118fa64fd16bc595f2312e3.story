A suicide bomber driving a motorcycle packed with explosives rammed his bike into a patrol of Afghan and international forces on Monday morning in eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 14 people, including three NATO service members and their translator, officials said.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast, which came as relations between international forces and their Afghan partners have been pushed to the breaking point by a surge in insider attacks by Afghan allies.

The attack comes as top Afghanistan official General John Allen blasted the rash of insider attacks, saying he was 'mad as hell' that terrorist forces were taking advantage of the United States' 'vulnerabilities' during the troop withdrawal and warned that the insider attack would be the 'signature' of the current stage.

Blast: Afghan police inspect the site of a suicide bomb attack targeting a convoy of NATO's soldiers of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), in Khost, Afghanistan, 01 October 2012

The bomber struck a group of Afghan police and international troops shortly after they got out of their vehicles to walk through a market area in Khost city, the capital of Khost province, said provincial government spokesman Baryalai Wakman.

Six civilians and four police officers were killed in the blast, Wakman said. He said the police officers were part of a specialized quick-reaction force.

Blood could be seen on the market road as Afghan police and soldiers tried to clean up the area after the blast. Slippers and bicycle parts were strewn about.

'I heard the explosion and came right to this area. I saw the dead bodies of policemen and of civilians right here,' said policeman Hashmat Khan, who ran to the site of the blast from his job as security for a nearby bank.

Coalition spokesman Maj. Adam Wojack would only confirm that three NATO service members and their translator died in a bombing in the east on Monday, without giving an exact location or the nationalities of the dead.

The international military alliance usually waits for individual nations to announce details on deaths.

Most of the troops in the east and in Khost province are American. It was not immediately clear if the translator was an Afghan citizen or a foreigner, Wojack said.

Dozens of Afghan civilians were also wounded in the bombing. The city's hospital alone was treating about 30 people injured in the explosion, said Dr. Amir Pacha, a physician working there. He added there could be other victims being treated at nearby private clinics.

'In Iraq, the signature weapon
system that we hadn't seen before was the IED.

We had to adjust to 
that.

Here, I think the signature attack that we're beginning to see is 
going to be the insider attack.'

General John Allen

Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in text messages to media that the insurgent group was behind the attack.

Joint patrols between NATO and Afghan forces have become more limited following a tide of attacks by Afghan soldiers and police on their international allies. 

Last month, the U.S. military issued 
new orders that require units to get approval from higher-ups before 
conducting operations with Afghans.

Then,
two weeks later, U.S. officials said most missions were being conducted
with Afghans again, though the system of approvals has remained in 
place.

The close contact — coalition forces 
working side by side with Afghan troops as advisers, mentors and 
trainers — is a key part of the U.S. strategy for putting the Afghans in
the lead as the U.S. and other nations prepare to pull out their last 
combat troops by the end of 2014.

Death: Air Force Pararescueman, or PJ, drapes an American flag over the remains of the first of two U.S. soldiers killed minutes earlier in an IED attack in Kandahar province, southern Afghanistan on July 29, 2010. U.S. military deaths in Afghanistan have surpassed 2,000

But the rising death toll for international troops has increased calls in the U.S. and other allies to get out as soon as possible. 

On Sunday, a U.S. official confirmed 
that an American soldier was killed in a firefight that broke out 
between Afghan and U.S. troops, sparked by either a premeditated attack 
or confusion about the origins of an insurgent strike.

Withdrawal: Instability and vulnerability precipitated by President Barack Obama's plan for troop withdrawal by 2014 has left an opening for insider attacks, a top general has said

General Allen spoke with 60 Minutes to discuss the disturbing trend of insider attacks.

'I'm mad as hell about them, to be honest with you,' General Allen said.

'We're going to get after this. It reverberates everywhere, across the United States. You know, we're willing to sacrifice a lot for this campaign. But we're not willing to be murdered for it.'

President Barack Obama's plan for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan calls for the United States military to train Afghan's to defend their own country as the remaining 68,000 American troops will return home in 2014.

'The enemy recognizes this is a vulnerability,' General Allen said.

On Sunday, the Pentagon announced th death of the 2,000th servicemember.  This year, 1 in 5 combat-related deaths of American or NATO-allied troops has been the result of Afghan insider attacks.
