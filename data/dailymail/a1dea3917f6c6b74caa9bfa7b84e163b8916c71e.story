Jailed: Christopher Birch fled to Spain after being charged with raping his wife and indecent exposure to his step-daughter. He has been jailed for 15 years

A rapist who  forced his wife to have sex with him in front of her eight-year-old daughter has been jailed for 15 years after fleeing to Spain.

Christopher Birch fled while on bail following his repeated attacks on Louise Birch over six years.

During one incident, Louise's daughter Sophie O'Farrell had heard her mother's anguished screams and walked in the room - but her step-father brutally continued.

However, when he was due to appear in court charged with rape and indecent exposure in May 2011, he never arrived - sparking a three-year manhunt.

He was still at large seven months later when Louise died after an illness aged just 33 in December 2011.

Today, Sophie, 18, has said she can 'finally rest' as Birch is jailed for 15 years for rape and indecent exposure to a child. 

Addressing her ordeal, Sophie, who has waived her right to anonymity, said: 'My bed was right up against her wall, you could hear it.

'If you can hear your mum screaming, then you're going to go in there.

'He [Birch] was stopping my mum from saying anything with his hand over her mouth.

'It's not like he stopped when I walked into the room. He just said "it's ok we're just playing".

'I was confused when I saw it. I knew it wasn't right.

'I said something the next morning and my mum said "we were playing".

'There was always something between us after that, and I do blame him for that.

'Now she's dead I can't regain that with her. That is upsetting because he's done that. He's ruined a lot of lives.

'It's hard to rekindle relationships when you know something so horrible has happened to someone.'

Mr and Mrs Birch met in late 2004 and married in December 2005. 

After they split in 2007, he sent Sophie, then aged 13, pictures showing his genitalia.

Sophie, of Waterlooville, Hampshire, said: 'It was vile. It sickened me.

'It was disgusting to think that he was meant to be a father to me. That was a big thing to me.'

Police contacted the family in June 2010 while investigating a harassment case involving Birch, 34, formerly of Gosport, Hampshire. He was convicted of harassment and given a sexual offences order.

They then told police of the rape and messages, and recorded video witness statements detailing the crimes.

Birch was arrested again and charged with five counts of rape and two charges of causing a child to look at an image of sexual activity between 2004 and 2010. 

He was released on bail.

But when his case came to Portsmouth Crown Court in May 2011, he did not appear.

Police were forced to launch a manhunt after he was spotted fleeing the country on a Calais-bound ferry from Dover. 

Birch had previously denied raping Louise and sending the messages and a jury trial went ahead without him in May 2012.

He was found guilty of two counts of rape and two counts of causing a child to look at an image of sexual activity.

The jury found him not guilty of three counts of rape charges. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in his absence.

He was brought back to this country last month after being found by the Spanish authorities after a European arrest warrant was issued earlier this year.

Sophie said giving evidence in court was traumatic and she was unable to move on knowing Birch was still free.

Sophie added: 'I think he was trying to say he hadn't done it - if he hadn't then why run away?

'If that hadn't have happened, we wouldn't be here three years down the line.

'I could've moved on with my life. I'm happy that he's finally going to see justice for what he's done.

'It will put it to rest. Now he's in prison I know where he is.'

While he was at large, Louise became seriously ill and underwent a kidney transplant and had her leg amputated before her death.

Sophie's maternal grandmother Linda O'Farrell, 58, said she was pleased justice had been served.

She said: 'My daughter and granddaughter have got their justice now.'

Birch was sentenced to another seven months in prison at Portsmouth Crown Court last week for failing to surrender.

Judge Sarah Munro QC said it was 'hard to imagine a more serious offence'.

Judge Munro said: 'The decision you made to abscond led to delays in the trial process and vast expense as the police tried to locate you.

'In absconding yourself you looked to avoid a conviction. Your wife was alive but very ill when the process started.

'It's hard to imagine a more serious offence of this kind. There must be an additional penalty.'

The seven months will run consecutively from his 15-year sentence handed to him previously.

Judge Munro added his escape to Spain knocked public confidence in the justice system and was a drain on resources.

Unyime Davies, mitigating, said Birch said he was remorseful, and disappeared because he was 'simply scared'.

Birch previously exposed himself to schoolgirls, jumping out of bushes with his pants around his ankles while performing a sex act.

It left women and girls scared to walk alone, sparked an undercover police operation and saw him branded the 'Gosport Flasher'.

Birch was found guilty of indecent exposure and given 180 hours community service in April 2005.

He was convicted of three counts of outraging public decency and three counts of indecent exposure between April 1 and June 16 in 2004.

He had admitted the offences in police interview but then tried to claim he was just urinating.

Sophie said she didn't know if her mother knew of the case.
