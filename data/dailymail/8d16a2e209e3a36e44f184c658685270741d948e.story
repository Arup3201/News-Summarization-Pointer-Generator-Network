Paul Scholes says Manchester United look a worse team despite spending £220million in 18 months as he accused Louis van Gaal of lacking ambition.

The Reds legend turned pundit slammed the Dutchman for being 'really happy to be fourth' and criticised his style of play after Wednesday night's 1-0 win over Newcastle United.

Asked if Van Gaal was setting his sights high enough, Scholes responded: 'No. He looks really happy to be fourth but this is a club that needs to be challenging to win the league. He's spent £150m.

'They spent £70m last year under David Moyes as well, that's £220m in 18 months and they look worse.

'He's not obsessed with possession but it is a very possession based game and what we've been used to over the years is not what are getting - and we probably won't get that. It's not great to watch but you have to say they are winning games.

'Not finishing fourth is not good, but to me not challenging for the league is not good enough. But we have to give him time. They can't keep on sacking managers.'

Scholes, who was speaking on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show, said United must be patient with the Dutchman but stressed that questions would have to be asked  if the club were not challenging for the title next season.

'Maybe the coach does need time to settle in too, but the one thing he has got is (Ryan Giggs, United’s assistant manager) to help him settle and get him used to what to expect from Liverpool and from Newcastle,' he said.

'I can probably forgive him for this season - he's brought new players and they need time to settle in and so does he. But this time next year if they are not challenging for the league then something is wrong.’
