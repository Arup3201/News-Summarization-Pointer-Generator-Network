A father from Houston, Texas is in tears after learning the nine-year-old daughter he thought was still alive was discovered dead in the refrigerator at his ex-girlfriend's home.

A neighbor called police to the Happy Home apartments in the 10100 block of Club Creek at 6 p.m. on Monday after finding the girl Ayahna Comb dead and wrapped in blankets in the refrigerator.

The neighbor told reporters she grew worried when he hadn't seen the child in a while.

When the paramedics arrived at the home of mother Amber Keyes, they determined that the child must have been dead for at least a month.

The girl's father Armand Comb told KHOU that his daughter suffered cerebral palsy and even though she couldn't communicate or walk, she was always happy. 

Comb last saw his daughter two months ago and she appeared to be in good health.

'Last
 time I saw her, she was looking good. It looked like she was gaining 
weight. Her cheeks were kind of fat. I would never, never suspect that,'
 he said.

When
 Comb spoke to his ex-girlfriend on Monday, the day his daughter was 
discovered, 'She was talking like she was there with them,' he said.

For the time being, child services has taken away his second daughter younger daughter.

'Hopefully she will come back home tomorrow, or go to my cousin’s house,' he said.

I just want to know what happened man, why?  I was right here I would’ve helped. I would’ve done anything.'

It's still unclear how the little girl died.

The Mail Online contacted Houston police who said that Keyes was being cooperative with police.

Relatives say that Keyes turned herself in. Police have not yet filed any charges against the mother.
