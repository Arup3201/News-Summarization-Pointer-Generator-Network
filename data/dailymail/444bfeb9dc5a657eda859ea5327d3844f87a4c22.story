Legal high: Methoxetamine was linked to two deaths in Leicestershire at the weekend

A dangerous new ‘legal high’  drug is set to be banned within weeks after two people died after taking it.

Home Office advisers are considering a ‘fast track’ ban on Methoxetamine – known as Mexxy or MXE – after a woman and man died last month.

The powder, which is available on the internet for £17 a gram, is often sold as a ‘safe’ alternative to ketamine, a horse tranquilliser used as a party drug.

Campaigner Maryon Stewart, whose daughter Hester, a medical student, died after taking a legal high called GBL before it was banned, said users should not assume MXE is safe.

Mrs Stewart, who founded campaign group the Angelus Foundation, added: ‘What is so scary is it’s promoted as a safe substance, unlike ketamine.

Party drug: Methoxetamine has been billed as a safe alternative to ketamine - although there is no evidence the claims are true

‘But there is no evidence whatsoever 
that this is safe. The chemists behind this are filling their pockets 
while users are playing Russian roulette with their lives and 
wellbeing.’

The Advisory Council on the Misuse of 
Drugs can approve a temporary ban for 12 months, which would allow MXE 
to be examined to see whether a  permanent ban is needed.

Experts estimate more than 40 new 
legal highs hit Britain last year, up from just 13 in 2008. Last month 
the deaths of a woman, 59, and a man, 32, in Leicestershire were linked 
to MXE.

Home Office Minister Lord Henley said:
‘We have become increasingly concerned at  the potential harms of 
Methoxetamine, and continue to work with our drug experts on the ACMD to
decide on the best way to protect public health.

‘It is important for those considering
using these drugs  to understand that just because a substance is 
legal, it does not mean it is safe.’

Methoxetamine is just the latest legal high to appear on Britain's streets.

Many of the concoctions are dangerous - but because the authorities know so little about them they can be taken without fear of prosecution.

The number of legal highs on sale hit 40 last year, up from just 13 in 2008.

Doctors believe that these drugs could lead to psychosis, liver damage and even death — warnings which are going unheeded by ­consumers, and the Government.

As these drugs are legal, it means premium prices - and profits. For instance, a small packet of Blast Off - a herbal marijuana substitute - costs £30, more than four times the price of the same amount of marijuana.

However, far from being a benign, risk-free way of taking drugs, the growing army of British users are risking their lives by ingesting potentially lethal ­cocktails of chemicals, often concocted by corrupt pharmacists working in China and India.

The legal high Mephedrone - or meow meow - was banned in 2010 after being linked to a number of deaths.

However, it was rapidly replaced by MDMA. Ivory Cove is another popular 'legal high' which is yet to be banned.
