More than 4,000 police officers were disciplined for criminal behaviour in the past five years.

They include an inspector who was sacked after being arrested for shoplifting and a PC who resigned after installing a camera in a ladies toilet.

A sergeant in Lancashire was also sacked after he was discovered with three sub-machine guns and ammunition. A colleague from the same force resigned after being caught drug-trafficking.

Under scrutiny: The number of police officers disciplined for criminal behaviour has soared by more than 50 per cent in the past five years

Shocking new figures, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, show criminality among the rank and file of Britain's police forces is on the rise.

The number of officers found guilty of misconduct has shot up by 56 per cent - from 559 in 2008 to 873 in 2012.

In total, 4,115 officers were disciplined over criminal behaviour, of which 643 were dismissed or forced to resign.

More than 100 were at the rank of inspector or higher.

Some of the offences were extremely serious including a PC in South Yorkshire who was sacked after assaulting a partner and two others who resigned after being arrested for perverting the course of justice.

Problem: The Met has seen a sevenfold increase in the number of officers disciplined for criminal behaviour

But the punishment handed out to officers for their behaviour also varied. In some cases individuals were let off with a written warning for offences which the public would deem unacceptable.

They included an officer who had a sexual relationship with a vulnerable victim of domestic violence and another who had sex in a public place.

London's Metropolitan police force saw a sevenfold increase in the number of officers guilty of misconduct - from 47 in 2008 to 327 last year.

Javed Khan, of the charity Victim Support, said officers who engage in criminal behaviour undermine the public's confidence.

'Victims need to have confidence in the integrity of the police of they are to report crime and give evidence.

'Our staff and volunteers work closely with the police every day and know the officers in these cases are a tiny minority. Their actions are entirely unrepresentative of their colleagues.'
