Posing for their wedding pictures, this could be any couple celebrating their big day with family and friends.

But after the vows were exchanged and the cake cut, the blushing blonde bride and her new husband immediately went their separate ways - one with a precious new visa and the other with a £5,000 payoff for her troubles.

The glossy photographs show the lengths that organisers of a sham marriage ring went to in order to convince the authorities that these, and other, nuptials were the real deal.

Police issued this photo of Amanda Nolan who was sentenced to 44-weeks imprisonment which was suspended for two years

The brides were dressed in white, while ‘guests’ were even brought in for convincing receptions at a country club.

Yesterday two men and three women were
sentenced for taking part in fake ceremonies for cash in a scam 
arranged by a Vietnamese fixer nicknamed ‘The Spider’.

Trang Thi Thuy Luu, 24, is now on the 
run after being identified as being ‘at the centre of a web’ in the 
highly organised sham marriage operation.

The Vietnamese nail bar owner sought 
out cash-strapped customers to enter into bogus weddings with her 
friends and family so they could gain marriage visas to stay in the UK.

The court heard how Amanda Nolan took part in the scam and the day after her wedding jetted off to Mexico using her £4,000 payment from the bogus wedding

The scam was rumbled after fake bride 
Amanda Nolan went on holiday with another man only six days after her 
‘wedding’ to her Vietnamese groom, Tuan Hoang Luu.

Nolan, 28, was handed £5,000 to enter into a ‘marriage of convenience’ in October 2010 arranged in her local nail salon.

She used the cash to pay for a 
two-week holiday in Mexico with her actual partner John Doyle. But after
they fell out while away, he told the police the trip had been paid for
by the wedding scam.

It led to Nolan, Kevin Donnelly, Jason
Proctor, Denny Wallace and Gemma Nelson being sentenced for entering 
into, or witnessing, sham weddings to keep Vietnamese immigrants in the 
UK.

Yesterday Donnelly, 34, and Proctor, 40, were both jailed for 10 months.

The three women - Nolan, Nelson, 28, and Wallace, 22 - were given two-year suspended sentences.

Judge Michael Byrne said they were 
‘selected stooges’ who were ‘used for their British passports’ in a 
‘wholly personal commercial enterprise’ in each case.

He said the nail bar owner Miss Luu 
‘was the woman at the centre of the operation. She was the spider at the
centre of the web.’

Judge Byrne said there was a ‘higher 
dishonest organisation’ involved because, after Luu’s home was raided by
police in 2011, the entire staff at her three Miss Nail salons 
disappeared overnight.

The businesses in Preston, Blackburn and Chorley in Lancashire were almost immediately taken over by other Vietnamese nationals.

Police said they are continuing to 
hunt Luu and at least three of her Vietnamese associates in connection 
with the sham marriage scheme.

But they admitted they have little 
information on the whereabuts of Nolan’s ‘groom’ Tuan Hoang Luu, 24, 
Proctor’s ‘bride’ Le Thi Le Quyen, 23, as well as Luu and her partner 
Dat Van Vu, 23.

Detective Sergeant Julie Cross highlighted the level of detail that had gone into the bogus ceremonies.

The fake weddings included rings, a cake, the bride’s dress, guests, wedding breakfasts and a reception in a country club.

DS Cross said: ‘They spent a lot of 
time and money to deceive the authorities, creating the impression that 
they were genuine marriages.

‘I hope the case acts as a warning to those who abuse immigration rules to help people to illegally remain in the UK.’

Luu, used her connections as the manager of the nail bars to entice three Britons into sham weddings between 2008 and 2010.

It enabled her friends and family to successfully apply to the Home Office for visas to remain in Britain.

Preston Crown Court heard ‘the edifice
of these marriages came tumbling down’ when fake bride Amanda Nolan, of
Blackburn, Lancs, used her payment to go on holiday.

CCTV footage of her ‘wedding day’ showed several Oriental guests behaving appropriately at the reception in the country club.

But Nolan and her co-defendants were heavily under the influence of alcohol and treated the occasion as ‘a joke and a farce’.

Nolan was arrested in February 2011 
and police found a stash of documents at Luu’s house which were ‘stock 
in trade’ for bogus weddings including passports, birth certificates and
wedding photographs.

They revealed that Luu had begun 
the racket by arranging her own sham marriage to Donnelly in October 
2008. He received £1,500 for the wedding witnessed by Nelson.

Donnelly was then paid £500 to be a witness at the wedding of Proctor and nail bar worker Le Thi Le Quyen in May 2010.

Proctor claimed in court that his marriage was a ‘real love match’ but he received around £2,000 from Luu.

Donnelly, of Oswaldtwistle, Lancs, pleaded guilty to assisting unlawful immigration and was jailed for 10 months.

Proctor, of Blackburn, was convicted after trial and also jailed for 10 months.

Nolan was given 44 weeks, suspended for two years and Nelson, also of Blackburn, was given 36 weeks, suspended for two years.

Wallace, of Blackburn, was offered
work experience painting nails in a salon to be Nolan’s witness. She 
was also given a 36-month sentence, suspended for two years.
