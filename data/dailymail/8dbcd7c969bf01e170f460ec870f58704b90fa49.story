America's self-proclaimed 'mom-in-chief' has some advice for the parents of perpetually troubled pop star Justin Bieber, who in the last month has been charged with multiple crimes in several different states as critics blast the child star as 'going off the rails.'

Michele Obama - in an interview released Friday - says she would advise Bieber's parents to play a more active role in the young star's chaotic life.

'I would pull him close,” Obama said of the 19-year-old pop singer in an interview with Univision, when asked how she’d treat the troubled star if she were his mother.

'I don’t know if it would be advice as much as action. I would be very present in his life right now. And I would be probably with him a good chunk of the time, just there to talk, to figure out what’s going on in his head, to figure out who’s in his life and who’s not, you know,' she continued.

The first lady added that she's noticed with her own teen children that they 'just want you near, you know, they want that advice from a parent. They want to see you on a daily basis.'

Obama added that because Bieber is 'still a kid, he's still growing,' that lesson still applies.

The first lady isn't the only high-profile politico who's chimed in on Bieber's multiple brushes with the law - Florida Senator Marco Rubio also has weighed in on the troubled star, while noting that members of Congress have other, more pressing issues to be worrying about than the latest child star run amok.

'I don’t know, man, we have got our hands full with things other than that. I hope he gets some help. That dude is in trouble,' Rubio told TMZ in a video posted last month.

Despite lawmakers having other priorities, Rubio insisted that he hopes Bieber gets the help he needs.

'The last thing we need to be dealing with is some 19-year-old pop star, but just from the little bit I read and I heard, it sounds like he’s got a lot of problems,' Rubio said.'A lot of problems, personal. I hope he gets some help for it, or he is going to wind up in a bad, bad place,' the senator added.

In the days following his arrest in Florida for allegedly drag-racing with a rented Lamborghini while high on marijuana and prescription medication, a petition was started to have the Baby singer - who is a citizen of Canada - deported back to the U.S.' neighbor to the North.

Within days, the petition garnered more than 100,000 signatures.
