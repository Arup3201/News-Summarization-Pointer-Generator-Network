A decorated female police officer who sued Britain's biggest police force for racial discrimination after claiming she was called a n***** by a colleague has won her case and will return to work. 

Ricky Haruna, 39, whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from London's Metropolitan Police last June after complaining about racism and launched a case for harassment and wrongful dismissal.

She is now returning to duty after an appeals tribunal backed her claims.

PC Haruna was sacked from the force after what she called a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud, one of three claims which led to her dismissal, and which she was later cleared of.

She told the tribunal the Met only took disciplinary action against her because she pursued the racism complaints.

She said: 'There was no evidence on which any reasonable, unbiased panel would have dismissed me.'

The racist abuse started in 2010 when a suspected shoplifter called her 'midnight' - a racist term used in South London.

She said instead of supporting her other officers present 'appeared to laugh'.

She added she did not receive support from senior officers when she told them a colleague called her 'a n*****'.

She said: 'After that I was harassed and ­ victimised by racist police officers and those that support and cover up for racists in senior management.'

She also said she was excluded from a staff Christmas dinner, telling the tribunal: 'I was the only black police officer and only female police officer based in that office at the time and I felt singled out and picked on.'

She was sacked seven years after she was pictured alongside Kate Middleton - then Prince William's girlfriend - and who she regularly escorted.

Although she cannot speak about the case as she is now re-employed by the force, her lawyer Lawrence Davies said: 'She was devastated to be unlawfully dismissed and elated to be reinstated.

 'She very much looks forward to rebuilding her career in the Met Police,' he told the Sunday Mirror. 

He previously said: 'When PC Haruna reported the bullying in the workplace, rather than support her, the Met's response was to target her and sack her.' 

PC Haruna joined the Met in January 2002 after graduating in sociology and criminology from Goldsmiths, ­University of London.

She saved the lives of two people during her career and was awarded two commendations.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Her disciplinary process was prompted by a public complaint regarding alleged criminal conduct which was investigated by the Directorate of Professional Standards. 

'It is only right that such complaints are investigated, however, the steps taken by the MPS in this instance will be reviewed in the light of the PAT findings.'
