Mike Betts, 51, received the money as boss of Motability Operations

The chief executive of a taxpayer-funded scheme that leases cars and  scooters to the disabled earned about £850,000 in pay and perks last year.

Mike Betts, 51, received the money as boss of Motability Operations, a not-for-profit company funded by the state.

Four other senior directors at the firm also earned large sums, taking home more than £2million in total in 2012.

Motability Operations, which received
 £18.3million in government grants last year to cover its running costs,
 leases various types of vehicle to around 600,000 disabled people.

It receives their mobility allowances direct from the Department for Work and Pensions.

Last night politicians and campaigners condemned the ‘lavish’ and ‘over generous’ management pay scales, and called for cuts. 

Labour
 peer Lord Rooker said: ‘This scheme has been run for 30 years and 
provides an excellent service but I can’t believe it requires people on 
banker-style salaries to administer it.’ 

Jonathan
 Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is vital 
that mobility allowances are used to help those who really need it.

This is a staggering sum of money for someone to earn from a business whose only customer is taxpayers. 

‘Given
 Motability Operations is wholly reliant on government grants it’s 
absolutely right that it should face scrutiny over how it is run.’

Disability campaigner Josh Lennon said: ‘There is absolutely no need for the Motability bosses to be paid such lavish salaries. It is time these over-generous wages were reined in.

'They do a good job ensuring many people have the independence and mobility they wouldn’t otherwise have, but we would like to see cuts in their remuneration.’ 

Motability Operations is owned by Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, and overseen by registered charity Motability.

In its annual report, the company boasts that it is guaranteed an income stream with ‘minimal credit risk’.

Mr Betts, who has been chief executive since 2003, is the highest-paid director, on a basic salary of £487,525.

He also received £237,500 in performance-related pay, £24,295 in benefits and £96,881 in lieu of pension.

The scheme faced criticism in 2011 over claims that expensive saloon cars leased to the disabled were being driven by their family and friends. 

Government officials voiced concerns that it was encouraging spurious benefits claims, and that checks on relatives allowed to drive the cars were too lax.

In 2006, Welsh welterweight boxing champion Keith Jones used his free Motability car to drive to the gym and fight 100 bouts.

The boxer was fined £500 in June that year after claiming he did not know he had to tell the DWP that his asthma condition had improved.

A Motability Operations spokesman said Mr Betts had been ‘instrumental in driving forward changes to the organisation to deliver the levels of personal care, expertise and service required’.

He added: ‘The remuneration is decided by the board based on the advice of their Remuneration Committee.’ 

The spokesman said pay is reviewed  regularly to ensure it is competitive over the long term, and to make sure rewards are related to performance.

Welfare Minister Lord Freud said in a statement: ‘The department regularly monitors and evaluates the use of public funds by the organisations we work with, including charities such as Motability, to make sure the services they deliver are fit  for purpose.’
