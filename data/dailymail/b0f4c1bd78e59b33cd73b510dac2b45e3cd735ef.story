Police in Texas have released a sketch of a suspected robber, but unless they are looking for Morph, they might struggle to locate him.

The e-fit was sent out by Lamar County Sheriff’s Department after two women were robbed at knife point in Paris, Texas last Thursday.

However, the poorly drawn composite sketch looks more like a cartoon character than a human being.

Robbed by Morph? This is the e-fit sketch released by Lamar County Sheriff's Department in search for a suspect in an armed robbery

The man depicted in the sketch allegedly robbed the two women around 11am on Thursday as they approached a house in East Post Oak Community in Lamar County, Paris.

The man, described as 6ft tall with short black hair, a round face and tattoos on his arms and neck threatened the women with a knife, demanding money.

When given when he wanted, the man fled on foot, Lamar County Sheriff’s Department told eParisExtra.

The sheriff’s department stresses that the sketch is ‘not a true depiction of the suspect, only a likeness,’ the website said.

Just as bad: This e-fit was sent out by Bolivian police in 2009 during a murder investigation and actually resulted in an arrest

The 'egg' man: A sketch of a sketch which Portuguese police used in the hunt for a suspect in the Madeleine McCann case

Although this may possibly be the world's worst e-fit it is not without competition.

In 2009, Bolivian police released a sketch of a suspected murderer which looked nothing like an actual person, however they did manage to catch a suspect.

Portuguese police did not do much better in their search fro Madeleine mcCann, showing local business owners a faceless, egg-shaped head.

The sheriff’s department has released a composite sketch of the suspect and encourages the public with any information on this individual or his whereabouts to please contact the Lamar County Sheriff’s Department at 903-737-2400 or Crime Stoppers at (903) 785-TIPS.
