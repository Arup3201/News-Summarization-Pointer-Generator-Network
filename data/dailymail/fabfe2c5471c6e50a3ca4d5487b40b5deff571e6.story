From Rory McIlroy's wins at Wentworth and Hoylake to Henrik Stenson's flying finish in Dubai via a Ryder Cup victory for Europe at Gleneagles, it's been quite a year on the European Tour.

That's not even mentioning Justin Rose claiming victory in Scotland, Pablo Larrazabal beating McIlroy in Abu Dhabi or Oliver Wilson beating, yes McIlroy again, on the Old Course to win the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship.

But amid all those great achievements, who was the one player to hit the best single shot of the year? The European Tour have selected their top shots from each month in which tournaments were played in 2014 for you to decide.

Jamie Donaldson hit the shot that clinched the Ryder Cup for Europe

These are the contenders and you can watch each shot in the video below...

January - Charl Schwartzel's incredible recovery from a cart path at the Volvo Golf Champions. The South African hit his iron off the tarmac to just two feet.

February - Victor Dubuisson's chip from desert scrub to five feet for a remarkable up-and-down in the final of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship final at Dove Mountain.

March - Miguel Angel Jimenez's holed bunker shot at the Eurasia Cup in Malaysia.

April - Danny Willett's hole-in-one at the Volvo China Open - the holed five-iron was the first ace of the Englishman's career.

May - Rory McIlroy's holed approach to the 7th hole at Wentworth's West Course during his victorious march towards the BMW PGA Championship.

June - Robert Rock's stunning escape out of knee-high rough during the Irish Open at Fota Island - he hacked out but set up a certain birdie from eight inches.

July - Sergio Garcia's holed approach to the 2nd hole at Hoylake during The Open.

August - Jamie Donaldson's laser-guided approach to the 8th hole at the D+D Real Czech Masters. The Welshman's shot from nearly 200 yards stopped six inches from the pin.

September - Donaldson's Ryder-Cup-winning wedge. He struck the shot to just 18 inches on the 15th at Gleneagles' Centenary Course to see off Keegan Bradley in the Sunday Singles and clinch Europe's victory over the United States.

October - Henrik Stenson's holed wedge at the Volvo World Match Play Championship that saw off Thongchai Jaidee on the 17th at The London Club's International Course.

November - Henrik Stenson's darevdevil tee shot on the 195-yard 17th at the DP World Tour Championship, which ended a foot from the hole.
