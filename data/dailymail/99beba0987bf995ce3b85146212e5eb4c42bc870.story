An alleged terrorist facing trial in New York City justified killing innocent people in suicide bomb attacks as a 'forgivable sin comparable to masturbation', court papers show.

Ali Yasin Ahmed made the twisted claim during conversations in 2008 intercepted by federal authorities as they put him and co-defendants Mahdi Hashi and Mohammed Yusuf under surveillance.

All three are to stand trial in Brooklyn charged with providing financial and material support to Somalian based militant group al-Shabaab, which has merged with al-Qaeda.

Accused: Madhi Hashi (pictured) is one of three men charged with terror offences in the United States relating to the Somalian al-Qaeda affiliate, al-Shabaab

The recorded messages were presented to the federal court and reveal Yusuf expressing his doubts to Ahmed about traveling to Somalia in November, 2008, because he was frightened of becoming a suicide bomber in the war-torn nation.

Ahmed though, calms his would-be terror colleague's fears by telling him that in his interpretation of Islam, suicide bombing attacks on civilians were easily justified.

'Ahmed minimized the significance of suicide bombings against civilian targets and suggested that if such attacks were in fact a sin, they were an immaterial, forgivable sin comparable to masturbation,' wrote Assistant U.S. Attorneys Shreve Ariail, Seth DuCharme and Richard Tucker in court papers submitted last week by the prosecution.

The three alleged al-Shabaab members were also allegedly commanded from the United States by Arab-American Jehad Mostafa, who lived in San Diego and was on the FBI's most wanted list.

Appearance: Jury selection for the trial of Ali Yasin Ahmed, Mahdi Hashi and Mohammed Yusuf will begin in February 2015

The prosecution allege they traveled to Somalia where Hashi, 25, joined a suicide bombing squad and Ahmed, 29 and Yusuf, 31 underwent military training.

Indeed, once in the troubled African nation, Yusuf appeared in a 2010 al-Shabaab propaganda video which was titled, 'Inspire the Believers', which was used as a recruiting tool, according to court papers.

Yusuf is also accused of threatening to behead Lars Vilks, the Danish cartoonist who  drew a sketch mocking the Prophet Mohammad.

Lawyers for the three are attempting to dismiss the charges, claiming there is no reason to prosecute them in the United States. 

If the three are found guilty they face spending up to 15 years in prison.

 A previous version of this article stated incorrectly as fact rather than allegation that Mr Hashi was an Al-Shabaab member and had joined a suicide bombing squad while in Somalia. It also stated Mr Hashi was suspected of having threatened to behead Lars Vilks, when only Mohammed Yusuf faced that accusation. A caption wrongly identified the man pictured as Ali Yasin Ahmed. Finally, a conviction for knowingly providing support for terrorism does not carry a mandatory life sentence, as we wrongly suggested.
