Employers have been warned that writing honest references for former employees could land them in court if they are particularly negative.

Employment experts have warned that a written reference which is critical of a former employee could see them sued for defamation or even 'post-employment victimisation'.

This follows a recent case where a car body repairer successfully sued his former employers after they provided a poor reference to an employment agency after he complained about discrimination.

Litigation fears could even see good candidates receiving bland references  summarising only the briefest of details of their career.  

Paul Megson, a tax partner at Deloitte told The Times that employers can speak freely on the phone but written references tend to be compiled by human resource managers 'intended to say as little as possible'.

He said: 'If you are downbeat
 about someone and they have an offer withdrawn, there is a concern over
 whether you have defamed them. If you are too generous, the 
new employer could say "this guy turned out to be an idiot".'

Former employees can access written references supplied to prospective employers under the Data Protection Act.

A recent case in the Court of Appeal saw car body repairer Pat Jessemey awarded almost £25,000 for unfair dismissal and age discrimination against his former employer Rowstock Ltd from Didcot, Oxfordshire.

Employers who give bad references about former employees could face prosecution for 'post-relationship victimisation' after the Court of Appeal upheld a recent Employment Tribunal discrimination case (picture posed by models)

The court heard that a director from the company gave Mr Jessemey a poor reference because he had made a complaint about discrimination before leaving the company.

The court upheld an earlier Employment Tribunal decision that Mr Jessemey had suffered 'post-employment victimisation' as a result of the bad reference and had been discriminated against.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission said 'post relationship victimisation' should be specifically outlawed.

The Commission's legal director Wendy Hewitt said: 'We supported this case in order to clarify an important principle of law namely that the Equality Act 2010 should be read as prohibiting victimisation which happens after someone has left their job and is then treated unfavourably because they have made allegations of discrimination.

'The fact that this claim has been successful means that it is clear that this protection also applies to former relationships in education, services, public functions and associations.'
