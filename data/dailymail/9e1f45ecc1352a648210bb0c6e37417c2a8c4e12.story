When Michelle Hui was told she had lost her baby in a miscarriage after six weeks of pregnancy, her world descended into a nightmarish blur.

After enduring five separate scans to confirm the devastating news, she was given abortion drugs to prevent any infection in her body.

Mrs Hui was then told she had potentially dangerous blood clots in her womb  and would have to have surgery to remove them.

Kisses! When Michelle went in for an operation on her uterus, doctors found a heartbeat. Megan Hui was born in February weighing just under 6lbs and is now thriving at 18 weeks old

But as doctors prepared to perform  this final procedure, a scan picked up a tiny heartbeat.

The
 astonished medical team told Mrs Hui that her baby had managed to 
survive both the miscarriage and the abortion pills – and she could 
continue with the pregnancy.

They said she had been pregnant with twins, and while one baby died, the other had clung on to life.

The blood clots could have created shadows on the scan images, obscuring the surviving foetus from view,  doctors said.

In February Mrs Hui, 31, and her husband Ross, 33, welcomed their ‘miracle’ daughter Megan into the family.

Weighing a healthy six pounds, she has continued to thrive at home with her sister Mya, four, and brother Noah, two.

The family have since been told that Megan’s story is so extraordinary that it has been written up in medical journals.

Mrs
 Hui said: ‘The miscarriage and abortion were absolutely horrific. The 
ten days between the miscarriage and going back to the hospital were 
just a blur.

‘But
 then I saw this little heartbeat. I thought it couldn’t be right. After
 all we had been through, I didn’t want to  get my hopes up. The doctor 
went out and came back in with a more senior doctor and he did the scan 
again and he said, “You are not going to believe it, we’ve got a 
heartbeat”. It was the best feeling ever.

‘Now
 Megan is fine. She is just a big healthy pudding of a baby. The doctors
 said it was a blessing. They have never heard of anything like it. 
Someone had been looking over us.’

She was six weeks pregnant when she began bleeding as she walked to  work, and feared she was suffering  a miscarriage.

She went to hospital where two  different doctors had carried out five scans before concluding she had lost  her baby.

She
 was given two abortion drugs – known as a medical abortion because it 
does not involve surgery – to prompt her womb to expel the dead foetus 
to prevent any infection.

Further
 tests showed there were blood clots in her womb so doctors prepared to 
perform a surgical procedure to remove them – until a scan showed 
Megan’s heartbeat.

Although
 the case is rare, medical abortions have a higher failure rate  than 
surgical terminations – up to 14 in every 1,000, although some studies 
suggest it could be as high as 4 per cent.

And in one in 100 cases, the womb is not entirely cleared and further medical intervention is necessary.

Mrs
 Hui, of Co Kildare, Ireland, told the Sunday Mirror she was angry that 
doctors at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin had failed to spot the 
surviving foetus before they prescribed the abortion drugs, which carry 
an increased risk of birth defects to any surviving baby.

She
 said: ‘As happy as I was, I was angry they had missed her on the scans.
 They said with all the blood and clots it must have created shadows so 
they couldn’t see her.’

Katherine
 Hales, a spokesman from the Association of Radical Midwives, which 
campaigns for improved maternity care in  the NHS, said it was an 
‘extraordinary case’.

She said: ‘I have very, very occasionally heard of rare cases of a miscarriage of one baby, and then seeing another on the scan.

‘But I have never heard of this happening. I can’t think of a medical reason for it to happen – it is just luck.’

The Rotunda Hospital was unavailable for comment.
