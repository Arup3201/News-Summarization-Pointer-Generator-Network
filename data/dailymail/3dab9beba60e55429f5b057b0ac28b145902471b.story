Questions surround the death of a 17-year-old Colorado girl who jumped out of a moving car and was struck dead by oncoming traffic on a major highway.

Catrina Fox was sitting in the passenger seat as her mother drove on a Colorado highway when she suddenly opened the door and jumped out in the very early hours of Saturday morning.

Catrina was hit by a fellow teen who was driving his 2001 PT Cruiser and died at the scene.

Mystery: Friends and family have no clear answers about why Catrina decided to jump out of the car Saturday

Witnesses saw something on the highway immediately after the crash and swerved to avoid hitting it. After stopping to see what it was, they found the girl's mother, whose name has not been released, distraught trying to understand what happened.

'That's my daughter. Is she alive?' the woman asked Dean Krakel who stopped his car to see what was going on.

He said that it was immediately clear that the girl was dead.

'I've never seen anything like that. She just got hit at full speed,' Mr Krakel told The Denver Post.

'It was horrific.'

No reasons have been given for why 
Catrina jumped out of the car, though police have said that they do not 
believe alcohol or drugs were a factor.

Her mother told investigators that the girl kicked out the door and jumped out of the moving car.

Catrina worked at a Denver catering 
company at the time of her death, but according to her Facebook wall she
 was gearing up for a move to California.

The
 days before her death seemed happy and filled with good news as she 
announced that she passed the first half of her high school equivalency 
exam and was taken off probation for an unknown prior offence.

'It feels good to be smilin again. i knew i just needed to focus on me for awhile [sic],' she wrote on January 18.

Family friend Cali Shields, who owns a gardening shop in town where Catrina's mother works, was left devastated when she heard the news.

She told 9news.com: 'The first thing that came to mind was her mom because she works here and I'm really close with her.

'I know she was a little bit troubled and upset about a lot of things. She was in and out of court.

'[But] she started just accepting life how it was and being happy about it.  I know she started to talk about plans to move to California and she was so excited.'

The
 boy who was driving the Cruiser that hit and killed Catrina has been 
cooperating with police and immediately stopped the vehicle after the 
crash.

There have been no charges filed against the boy, whose name has also not been released because he is a minor.
