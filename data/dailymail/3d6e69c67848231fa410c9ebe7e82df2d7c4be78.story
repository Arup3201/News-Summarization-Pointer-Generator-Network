J.C.X. Simon, 69, and three other men participated in the racially-motivated attacks in the 1970s

A 69-year-old black man who was convicted of participating in the infamous 'zebra murders' in San Francisco, California, in the 1970s was found dead at San Quentin State Prison. 

J.C.X. Simon was one of four black men convicted of carrying out a string of racially-motivated attacks that killed 14 people and injured seven. 

He was found in his one-man cell shortly before midnight Thursday, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

The cause of death is unknown and an autopsy is planned. 

Simon was convicted of two first-degree murder charges, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon in 1976 and was serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole, the maximum sentence allowed In California at the time.

The killing spree was dubbed the 'zebra murders' because of the special Z channel radio band investigators used, the San Francisco Gate reported.    

During a six-month murder spree from October 1973 to April 1974. the four men targeted white victims and murdered the majority of them with an execution-style shot to the back of the head.

The other three men who were convicted - Larry Green, Manuel Moore and Jessie Lee Cooks - are serving life sentences at other California prisons.

The trial saw 174 witnesses testify and was described as 'San Francisco's longest criminal trial' at the time. 

The victims were aged 15 to 87 and did not know one another, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Police stopped and questioned nearly every young black man they encountered between the ages of 20 and 30 who were 6ft tall or a few inches shorter.

Those questioned and cleared were given a card to show other officers who detained them. 

A federal judge eventually put a stop to the practice. 

After getting a tip from an informant, police raided an apartment complex and arrested seven men.

Simon, Cooks, Green and Moore were the only ones who were charged.
