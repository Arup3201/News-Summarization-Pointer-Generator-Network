Eden Hazard wants to emulate Didier Drogba and become a Chelsea legend by helping his side win the Champions League.

Drogba scored both the equalising goal and winning penalty in the 2012 Champions League final against Bayern Munich as Chelsea became the first team from London to win the competition.

Hazard, who joined the club the following season, claimed he is aiming to repeat Drogba's heroics.

Speaking to FourFourTwo, the 23-year-old said: 'I want to be like Didier. I want to do what he did against Bayern Munich. If he can do it, why can't I?'

But the Belgian midfielder has ambitions for domestic competition, too, and knows there is room for improvement.

'On a personal level last season was good for me, but I want more,' he said. ' Last season I scored 14 goals in the Premier League - that's not enough.

Hazard also said that he knows his own performances need to improve in domestic competitions

The Belgian said Chelsea's summer signings give them the experience and quality to win the Premier League

'We want to win the league now. 'We didn't have the right mentality in some of the games (last season) - we lost or drew against teams we should have beaten.

'This season we have learned from our experiences and signed some top players in Diego Costa, Filipe Luis and Cesc Fabregas - and Thibaut Courtois is back with us too. 

'These players can help us win titles at Chelsea.'
