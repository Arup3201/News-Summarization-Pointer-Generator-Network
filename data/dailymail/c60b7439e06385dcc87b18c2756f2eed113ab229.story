Romelu Lukaku insists the £28million that Everton paid to sign him on a permanent deal from Chelsea last summer was justified and claims one day he will be worth even more.

The Belgium striker left Chelsea after failing to impress manager Jose Mourinho and the Toffees broke their transfer record to take him to Goodison Park.

The 21-year-old enjoyed an impressive loan spell at Roberto Martinez's side in 2013-14 as he scored 15 Premier League goals in 29 starts, convincing the Everton boss to break the bank for his signature.

But Lukaku has endured a more difficult time in front of goal this season scoring only seven league goals from his 25 appearances, but the forward refutes suggestions Everton paid over the odds for him and blames his indifferent form on bad preparation in the summer. 

'After the World Cup I had vacation, but negotiations dragged on my transfer,' Lukaku told HLN. 'The season was over, but I did not know where I was going to play. Uncertainty. Wait, wait, wait.

'And then I was sure, remained only one week before the competition starts. Some said I was suffering from pressure after my transfer to Chelsea. But I just did not have good preparation. 

The striker believes that one day he will be worth even more than £28m

Lukaku decided to leave Stamford Bridge after failing to cement a place in the first team

'So no, because transfer fee of 35 million euros was not enough to me. for me that even is no limit. If I take a step forward, I'll be worth even more. You will not hear me say that 35 million is so much money.

'No, I will fully show that I'm worth that amount. Stronger I will do anything to increase my value yet.'
