Roberto Martinez must be wondering what he has done to upset referees over the festive period. 

On Boxing Day Lee Mason refused to send Stoke’s Jon Walters off when he pulled Leighton Baines back when clean through on goal — Everton lost that game.

Then on Sunday, with his Everton team a goal up, Papiss Cisse clearly elbowed Seamus Coleman twice while waiting for a corner to be taken.

Referee Craig Pawson appeared to be looking towards Cisse but he must have looked away, twice, to have missed the clear violent act which should have resulted in a routine red card for Cisse, who then scored Newcastle’s equaliser.

Former Newcastle manager Graeme Souness said Coleman might have broken his jaw.

Gary Neville added: ‘It’s the most certain red you will ever see.’ They were both right!

That moment proved to be the turning point as moments later Newcastle equalised through Cisse's strike
