A Montana judge told a 21-year-old man convicted in a vandalism spree to replace his fast-food job with a 'real job' so he can more quickly pay restitution.

The Billings Gazette reports District Judge G. Todd Baugh sentenced Brandon Daniel Turell to 10 years, with five suspended, and ordered him to pay over $13,000 in restitution.

Baugh is separately facing public censure and suspension for saying a 14-year-old rape victim appeared 'older than her chronological age.'

Prosecutors said Turell and a co-defendant used a stolen BB gun to shoot out the windows of about 100 vehicles in December 2012.

Turell entered a guilty plea to felony criminal mischief as well as misdemeanor counts of theft, theft by accountability and DUI.

'I'm very sorry for everything I've done,' he told Baugh.

Baugh asked Turell what he was doing to repay his victims.

Turell said he had been working at Burger King, to which Baugh responded: 'Why can't you get a real job?'

Turell said he was making $9.50 an hour.

Baugh revoked Turell's sentence for felony counts of robbery and burglary from 2009 as well as ordering him into the custody of the Department of Corrections until his 25th birthday in 2018.

At the end of the hearing, Turell was taken off in handcuffs by a detention officer.
