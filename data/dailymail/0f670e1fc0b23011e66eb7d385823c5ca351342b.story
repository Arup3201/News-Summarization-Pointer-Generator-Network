Brett Pitman bagged a first-half hat-trick as Bournemouth coasted past Blackpool 4-0 to return to the top of the Championship.

The Cherries were in cruise control at the Goldsands as they secured their third straight victory which condemned the Tangerines to a fifth consecutive defeat.

Basement side Blackpool came in search of their first win in eight matches but any hopes were dashed after just 10 minutes.

Jersey-born striker Pitman was afforded time and space to run past a sea of Tangerine players before slotting past goalkeeper Elliot Parish.

Pitman turned down Blackpool in favour of a move to Bristol City in 2010 and ensured the Seasiders - without an away win all season - had another miserable trip home.

Blackpool's first attack on Artur Boruc's goal came after 22 minutes when debutant Michael Jacobs won his side a corner which came to nothing.

Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick could have doubled his side's lead after 28 minutes but he headed over from a Matt Ritchie free-kick.

Tangerines supporters jeered their side and chairman Karl Oyston throughout and had only Andrea Orlandi's wayward effort to get excited about.

He scooped over after Nathan Delfouneso backheeled for the Seasiders skipper after 31 minutes.

A minute later Tom Aldred cleared the ball after Ritchie had teed up Pitman inside the box.

But Pitman was not kept at bay long and scored two goals in two minutes to complete his hat-trick inside 39 minutes.

The Cherries striker first headed back across goal from a Ritchie cross before drilling low past Parish from a free-kick routine.

Eddie Howe's side continued their dominance in the second period as they found the net once more four minutes into the second-half.

Blackpool midfielder Orlandi tripped winger Marc Pugh in the box and Callum Wilson scored his 19th of the season from the resulting spot-kick.

Ritchie easily evaded Tangerines defender Charles Dunne before finding Pitman once more who skewed over on 59 minutes.

Bournemouth were in total control and manager Howe even opted to withdraw skipper Elphick after just an hour as the Cherries began to ease off.

Substitutes Junior Stanislas and Adam Smith did combine with the latter's effort forcing Parish into a smart save with 15 minutes to go.

Smith then ran past Dunne before the legs of Parish kept out his effort.

The Tangerines are the lowest scorers in the division and failed to register a single shot on target at the Goldsands.

Blackpool striker Delfouneso went closest when he headed wide on 78 minutes after Orlandi whipped in a free-kick.

The Cherries won 6-1 away at Blackpool in December and almost echoed that goal haul when Stanislas and Pitman both went close in the final minutes before Blackpool defender Aldred blazed over his stoppage-time effort.
