Loic Remy celebrated his move to Chelsea with the winning goal as France heaped more misery on World Cup flops Spain.

The former QPR frontman climbed off the bench to bag the only goal of the game 16 minutes from time when he thumped the ball past David de Gea to earn Didier Deschamps' side a deserved victory at the Stade de France.

Spain dominated possession but they failed to muster a single shot on target as Hugo Lloris was a virtual bystander between the French sticks.

France: Lloris, Debuchy, Varane, Sakho, Evra, Matuidi, Pogba, Sissoko, Valbuena, Benzema, Griezmann.

Goals: Remy 74 

Spain: De Gea, Carvajal, S. Ramos, San José, Azpilicueta, Busquets, R. Garcia, Cazorla, Fabregas, Koke, D. Costa. 

Following a disastrous World Cup campaign, Vicente del Bosque looked to the new generation after midfield duo Xavi, Xabi Alonso and David Villa decided to hang up their boots on the international stage.

However, it was France who appeared the more dangerous on the counter attack in the first half in Paris.

Karim Benzema was a constant thorn in Spain's side. He had the first sight of goal that was easily saved by De Gea, then failed to get a proper connection when the ball dropped to him in the box.

Paul Pogba shot straight at De Gea, while Antoine Griezmann's thumping effort hit Sergio Busquets square in the face.

Chalked off: Benzema's effort was ruled out by the linesman's flag

Benzema forced a good save out of the Manchester United man before the break, but eventually had the ball in the net at the beginning of the second half when he converted Moussa Sissoko's perfectly-weighted cross. 

However, the Real Madrid frontman was wrongly denied by the linesman's flag as the visitors escaped once again. 

Spain failed to create any clear-cut chances and a frustrated Diego Costa was withdrawn midway through the second half along with Chelsea team-mate Cesc Fabregas. 

However, while it was agony for two Blues stars, it was ecstacy for another minutes later. Sissoko's flick played in Mathieu Valbuena, and he cut the ball back for sub Remy to crash the ball past De Gea from eight yards into the top corner.

Spain rallied, but David Silva failed to take a couple of chances to equalise as they slipped to another defeat ahead of their opening Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.
