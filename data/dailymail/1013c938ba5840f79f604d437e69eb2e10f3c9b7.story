A new technique does away with fillings and instead encourages teeth to repair themselves

The terrifying sound alone is enough to make most of us delay that annual check-up with the dentist.

But the whirring and grinding of those dreaded drills could be nothing more than a nasty memory thanks to a tooth-rebuilding treatment that could be available within three years.

A technique developed at King’s College London does away with fillings and instead encourages teeth to repair themselves.

What’s more, the procedure involves no injections at all – making opening wide for the dentist a far more pain-free prospect.

Tooth decay is normally removed by drilling, after which the cavity is filled with a material such as amalgam or composite resin.

The new treatment, called Electrically Accelerated and Enhanced Remineralisation (EAER), accelerates the natural movement of calcium and phosphate minerals into the damaged tooth. 

A two-step process first prepares the damaged area of enamel, then uses a tiny electric current to push minerals into the site to be repaired.

Professor Nigel Pitts, from the London university’s Dental Institute, said: ‘The way we treat teeth today is not ideal. When we repair a tooth by putting in a filling, that tooth enters a cycle of drilling and re-filling as, ultimately, each repair fails.

‘Not only is our device kinder to the patient and better for their teeth, but it’s expected to be at least as cost-effective as current dental treatments.’ 

As well as fighting tooth decay, the technique can also be used to whiten teeth, he said. A company, Reminova Ltd, has been set up to commercialise the research.

Based in Perth, Scotland, it is now in the process of seeking private investment to develop EAER.

The company is the first to emerge from a research centre at the college that was set up in January to turn innovations into new products.

The rising popularity of cosmetic dental treatments has prompted a surge in the development of pioneering techniques and products.

Last month, Unilever unveiled a toothpaste and serum it claims will regenerate 82 per cent of tooth enamel after just three days.

Its Regenerate Enamel Science Advanced Toothpaste, costing £10, contains minerals  that effectively build a new layer of white enamel and just needs a monthly ‘boosting serum’.
