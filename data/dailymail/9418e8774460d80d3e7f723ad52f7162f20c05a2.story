The mother of a disabled boy who was horrifically beheaded last week has led an emotional candlelit vigil for her executed son infront of 500 people.

Wheelchair-bound Jori Lirette was brutally executed and dismembered with a meat cleaver after his mother threatened to kick long term boyfriend Jeremiah Wright, 30, out of their Louisiana home.

The seven-year-old's mother Jesslyn, 27, led tearful tributes to the boy on Sunday after his father Wright reportedly confessed to the killing.

Disabled Jori, who was wheelchair-bound due to cerebal palsy and heart problems and also had limited speech, was found by a passing motorist after being allegedly decapitated by his father last week.

On Sunday the boy's mother led an emotional service in Peltier Park, Thibodaux, Louisiana, where she told an assembled crowd: 'You're walking in heaven now, where there is no pain or illness.'

As the boy's mother stepped away from the microphone, the crowd burst into applause and many people wept.

Jori's cousins also released 50 brightly coloured balloons above the park, while others lit candles passed from person to person.

Police said a stream of over 500 people eventually came to the park to honour the tragic seven-year-old during the 90-minute service.

It was revealed at the weekend that Jori's mother Jesslyn had previously warned police that his father wanted him dead.

The week before Jori was born, she obtained a restraining order against Wright after he 'broke the baby's piggy bank' and 'shoved her onto a pile of CDs on the bed'.

Then, when Jori was just six-months-old, she obtained another similar order after he called her and said he 'was tired of seeing the baby suffer' and wanted him dead.

Details of the orders, which Jesslyn apparently allowed to lapse, were revealed in sworn statements she made in 2004 and made part of the official court record this week.

Jori was wheelchair-bound and needed a feeding tube having been born with cerebral palsy. He had been born three months prematurely and spent much of his first year in hospital in New Orleans.

Wright chopped his son's head off with a meat cleaver and left it in the roadside outside his home so that Jesslyn would see it.

The crime scene was so gruesome that some of the police who responded to the emergency call have had to have counselling.

Investigators said the grisly killing was carried out over a kitchen sink at the Louisiana home the boy shared with his father and his mother Jesslyn.

His hand and feet were also cut off and discovered nearby in plastic garbage bags.

A forensic team removed the sink from the house in Thibodaux ,Louisiana, as part of their murder investigation.

Thibodaux Police Lt. Kim Favalora said in a statement to a court last week that: 'Wright was very matter-of-fact as he calmly explained that he thought for years that Jori was his son.

Scene: A driver spotted Jori's head as he was passing and reported it to the police who called it a heinous crime

According to reports Wright, seen here on Sunday, was sick of taking care of his special needs son

'Wright said that he recently saw the way the dummy looked at him and there were signs and little things the dummy did to him that let him know that Jori was not his son, but a dummy.'

Favalora said Wright told police that 'he was tired of taking care of the dummy. Wright said that as soon as he realized that Jori was a dummy, and not his son, he 'started contemplating on killing him.'

The document said Wright admitted to arguing with Jesslyn the previous night and that he expected to be kicked out of the house.

Wright, whose criminal history includes arrests for drugs, burglary and contempt, is being held on $5 million bond and could face the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder.

The murder has sent shock waves through the small town of Thibodaux, where the last killing was three years ago.
