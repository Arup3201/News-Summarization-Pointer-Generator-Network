The mother of a disabled man is pleading for serial rapist Patrick Comeagain to be moved from a small block of units where her son and other vulnerable people live.

Comeagain was seen breaking into dance when he was released from a West Australian prison in June on a strict supervision order that included curfews and electronic monitoring.

The Department of Corrective Services was forced to relocate Comeagain from a wheatbelt town to another town in Western Australia within days of him moving there over concerns for his safety, following an outcry from the community.

Rebecca - not her real name - told Fairfax radio on Tuesday that Comeagain was living next to her son, who has a severe brain injury from a motor vehicle accident.

Women, children and young men with mental illnesses also lived at the Department of Housing units, which were close to shops and a childcare centre, Rebecca said.

Residents were not told Comeagain was living next to them and only found out when a neighbour recognised him from the news.

'We were all very, very concerned,' Rebecca said.

'One of the tenants is afraid to leave her unit.'

Rebecca said authorities responsible for Comeagain initially denied he was living there and only admitted it when she persisted with her complaint.

She said Comeagain had to live somewhere but needed to be moved to more appropriate housing.

'It's almost a time bomb waiting to go off,' she said.

Comeagain has spent 14 years in prison, including time for raping a nine-year-old girl and two women

Comeagain was handed an indefinite detention order in October 2008 after spending most of his adult life - 14 years -Â  in prison and claims to have sexually assaulted 41 people, including men, women and children.

He had five episodes of serious sexual offending, starting in 1987 when he was 15.

The victims were generally adult women, but five offences in 1994 were committed against a nine-year-old girl. He raped a woman five weeks after being released on parole and 37 days after that he raped another woman in her home.

Comeagain was fined $1000 in August after he breached a condition of his supervision order that prohibited him from coming into contact with children.

The offence occurred when Comeagain attended a family gathering where children were present.

A WA Department of Corrective Services spokesman said the sex offender management squad continued to supervise Comeagain.

He said Comeagain's address and location was suppressed by the court and therefore could not be communicated to third parties.

Comeagain could be returned to custody if he breached a condition of his supervision order, the spokesman said.

The 41-year-old's release into the community includes a strict 10-year supervision order on the man - requiring him to wear a GPS tracker, comply to a strict curfew and not to have contact with a child under the age of 16.

In previous annual reviews of his dangerous sex offender status, it has been noted there had been very few occasions following his release from prison when Comeagain had not re-offended shortly after.
