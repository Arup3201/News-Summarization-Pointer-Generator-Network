Champions Northampton left Tyneside on Sunday with the bonus-point victory they needed to reignite their title defence, but also with fitness concerns over two England forwards.

Jim Mallinder’s side had this Aviva Premiership non-contest wrapped up within the first half- hour with three tries. Yet they had to wait until two minutes from time to secure the bonus, when George North crossed in the left corner following Newcastle defiance.

For the Saints, this was a fitting response to the setback of losing at Wasps — at least in terms of the scoreline, as the performance was patchy. It also leaves them set fair for a momentous showdown with Bath at Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday.

There are a few scattered clouds in the brighter skies over Northampton, however, caused by medical concerns. England flanker Tom Wood was withdrawn from the match with a bad back, while Test team-mate Courtney Lawes retired soon after half-time clutching his left shoulder. In addition, Stephen Myler is sidelined with a persistent calf injury.

As ever, the official line suggested no reason to panic, but only time will tell. 

Mallinder said: ‘Tom Wood has got a sore back. He actually got it against Gloucester, so he played last week with it. It’s been bothering him all week so we thought we wouldn’t risk it. I’m pretty comfortable that he and Courtney will be fine for next week.

‘Courtney just got a stinger in that last two minutes of defence in the first half. He put in a big tackle and just took a blow to the shoulder.’

For Newcastle, this was a 19th successive league defeat, stretching back to October last year. The manner of their second-half resurgence was reason for measured optimism, but what Dean Richards’ team desperately need is a positive result, whatever the nature of the performance.

In the first 30 minutes their defending was dreadful. Saints’ first try came when three tacklers fell away as Will Hooley ran to the line unchecked, while Josh Furno allowed Samu Manoa to breeze past him and set up a try for Ken Pisi.

The Falcons rallied with sufficient conviction after half-time to secure long spells of attacking possession, which led to a try by Noah Cato from a quick tap penalty on the right. But by then the damage was done.

Richards lamented the slow start, saying: ‘The way we turned up in the first 30 minutes wasn’t great. We fronted up in the second half but I wish we had done that in the first half.

‘Our exits weren’t great, we didn’t do what we said we were going to do and our work-rate was woeful. Once we showed some belief we were a match for them in the final 50 minutes.’

Northampton did enough to take what they wanted from this game without ever really hitting their peak, although there was slick play between Samu Manoa and Kahn Fotuali’i in the build-up to Alex Waller’s try.

Ben Foden ran with menace from full back and Hooley showed some assured touches as the playmaker deputising for Myler.

However, the Saints will have to be far more precise and ruthless against Bath, as they are well aware.

‘Bath are running hot at the moment,’ said Luther Burrell — no pun intended. ‘They are a team in form. We all watched their game against Leicester (which Bath won 45-0) and we know it’s going to be tough next weekend.’

Mallinder added: ‘We’ve respected Bath over the last few years. We had three really close games with them last season — we drew down there and just beat them in the Amlin Challenge Cup final.

‘They are a developing team and to beat any side by 40-odd points, particularly Leicester, means you have to respect them.

‘They’ve got threats all over the field, but we’ve got a few threats of our own.’
