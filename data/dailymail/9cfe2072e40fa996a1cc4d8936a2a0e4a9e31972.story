Spectators at a Florida wedding got quite the surprise when comic book villains and superheros showed up to join in on the nuptials.

Video game developer Adam Bohn and his wife Michelle Cheng planned a wedding with appearances from knights in shining armor, ninjas, Iron man, Batman, WWE star Jimmy Hart, and some feisty hotel bell-hops.

The video was posted on Wednesday and since then has gone viral with almost 800,000 views. The wedding guests had no idea that they were about to witness a thrilling performance by Adam, Michelle, and a group of hired actors.

'The guests had no idea,' wrote Bohn in the description under the Youtube Video.

The NY Daily News reports that the videographer didn't even know what was about to happen.

Bohn wrote on Youtube, 'The videographer scrambled and got 3 extra cameras when tipped off by a man in an Iron Man suit about what was going to happen.'

When the wedding officiant asked if anyone objected to the couple getting married--organized chaos ensued.

First, a knight in shining armor withdrew his sword and demanded that Bohn battle him to keep his love.

After Bohn stopped the armored gentleman from meddling, two men in suits stormed in with a group of ninjas doing back-flips.

It was a bridesmaid who won this small battle, after one threw a ninja down and another bridesmaid took a suitcase and smashed it over the ninja's leader's head. Another bridesmaid pushed a numchuck wielding ninja to the ground.

It started off like any other wedding and little did guests know it was about to take a wild turn

Upon recognizing Bohn's incredible ability to fight crime and stay calm amidst danger, Iron man came before him and begged that he join him in future battles.

Batman then rushed in the room, pushed Iron Man aside, and told Bohn that instead he should join him in Gotham City where they would fight and 'dance', and have a great time.

Bohn respectfully refused their lucrative offers and said that instead he must marry his love Michelle.

Just when everyone thought the show was over, the hotel manager stormed in and asked that everyone leave. He threatened anyone who didn'tÂ  would have to face his bellhops.

In a finale of courage and laughter, the bride, the groom, and the entire wedding party defeated the bellhops.

A sweaty and visibly smitten Bohn dipped Michele back and gave her a romantic wedding kiss. The applause was unanimous.
