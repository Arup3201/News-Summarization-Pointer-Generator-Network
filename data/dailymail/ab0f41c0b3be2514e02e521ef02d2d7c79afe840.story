From Bar to kitchen: Judith King has given up her job as a barrister to run a B&B, saying it pays better

A barrister who said she could no longer make ends meet thanks to legal aid cuts has quit her career - to open a B&B.

Judith King, 54, spent 10 years defending clients in Kent but said she was forced to rent a 'tiny house', drive a 'tiny, economical car' and rely on savings to pay basic household bills.

The mother-of-two claims her new business, in Grade II listed Greco-revival style townhouse 280 miles away in the Yorkshire Dales is better-paid and she is happier than she has been for years.

She said: 'The Government would like people to believe that all lawyers are fat cats - earning six figure sums.

'The truth is that many earn much less than that - some, like me, struggled to make ends meet.

'For me, defending and prosecuting the sort of cases I did and not to be able to afford a very modest lifestyle is ridiculous.

'At that time, I was renting a tiny house and running a tiny economical car yet I just couldn't earn enough to pay the basic household bills and I was subsidising everything with my savings.'

The former nurse used her medical expertise to prosecute complex cases including one of child rape and another involving the torture of two children.

After her first child was born, she completed a Masters degree and was called to the Bar in 2002 - but said she and her colleagues were hammered by successive cuts to legal aid.

Barristers walked out of courts across the country earlier this month in the first ever criminal bar protest over justice secretary Chris Grayling's plans to make Â£220 million in cuts by 2019.

So Ms King moved to Settle, North Yorkshire, with her partner Martin Perkins, who quit his medical sales job so he could help her convert their new home.

'I was used to opening a case in the crown court but this opening has made me very nervous,' she said.

She added: 'Although it is strange no longer being in court, in reality I am now happier than I have been for many years.

'I have no regrets. And when I saw my former colleagues stood in protest outside the Crown Court it just reassured me that I had made the right choice.

'The level of financial and personal sacrifice it takes to get to the Bar is considerable.

'Over the last few years the demands have become higher and higher and the money lower and lower.

Lawyers say the cuts could lead to miscarriages of justice. Conservatives say the budget is too bloated

'I was faced with the prospect of having to go up to London every day to get work there and I just couldn't face that. I loved Kent.

'Then I realised if the work was no longer enjoyable and you are not earning enough - then what was the point?

However, the barrister has not yet ditched her gown and wig, she said - adding: 'You never know'.
