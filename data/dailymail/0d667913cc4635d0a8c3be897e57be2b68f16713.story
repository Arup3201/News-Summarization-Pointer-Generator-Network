Ron Jee's family were forced to dab a wet sponge on his mouth for four days after doctors withdrew food and water under controversial end-of-life guidelines

A grandfather spent his final four days of life begging for food and water, his distraught family claim - attributing his suffering to a controversial end-of-life programme.

The pensioner's daughter has slammed under-fire Basildon Hospital in Essex accusing staff of treating her dying father without compassion.

Ron Jee, From Grays in Essex was admitted to Basildon Hospital in June after suffering a stroke.

But when the 80-year-old contracted pneumonia and his condition deteriorated in August doctors placed him on the plan, similar to the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP), his family claim.

A spokeswoman for the hospital said the pathway used at the trust is their own local version of the end-of-life programme.

His daughter Christine Coleman, 52, said her father was subjected to four days without food, water and medication.

She claimed her elderly father was reduced to begging, leaving his family to resort to dabbing a wet sponge around his mouth in a bid to relieve his suffering.

She said: 'He was spending his days crying.

'He was asking us "am I going to die?", he knew what was happening to him and it was heartbreaking for us all. We felt helpless, like there was nothing we could do.

'He was begging for water - we had to wet a sponge and put it around his mouth.

'If I did to my dog what they did to my father I would not be allowed to own a dog again.

'No one should have to spend their final days like that.'

Mrs Coleman, of Averley near Thurrock, claims her father was placed on the programme, which is usually reserved for patients who are predicted to die within hours of going on to it, prematurely.

She said her mother was consulted about doctors' decision to initiate the pathway, but adds that what it would entail was not explained properly.

She told the MailOnline: 'If I knew then what I do now there is no way we would have let doctors him on the pathway.

'No one explained to us in detail what it meant. When they (doctors) told us there was nothing they could do, I thought he was hours away from death not days.'

The grandmother backed the Government's decision to phase out the controversial LCP, adding: 'It is wrong to treat people like that. My dog was treated better when she had cancer.

'This is not about compensation, I want people to know and be aware so they can prevent it happening to their relatives.

'I have already made my children promise me that they will never allow me to be put on a pathway like this. It is the same as assisted death.'

She added: 'Before his stroke he was the life and soul of any party, and even after he suffered a stroke he knew how to enjoy himself.

'We held an 80th birthday party for him in January, he loved it. He was a hardworker and a great dad and grandfather. Everyone thought the world of him.'

The controversial LCP, which was designed in the late 1990s by the Royal Liverpool University Hospital's Marie Curie Hospice, aims to reduce suffering in the last hours and days of a dying person's life.

A spokeswoman for Basildon Hospital said an investigation into what happened to Mr Jee is still ongoing

The idea behind the Liverpool Care Pathway is to allow people with a 
terminal illness to die with dignity regardless of whether they are at 
home, in hospital or in a hospice.

It was developed during the late 1990s at the Royal Liverpool University
Hospital in conjunction with the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute.

It gives doctors the opportunity to review whether further tests or 
medication are helpful, to consider how to keep the patient as 
comfortable as possible and to decide whether fluids and food should 
still be given.

It was recommended by the Department of Health as a model of best practice and was adopted by most hospitals.

It was introduced because during the 1990s there was increasing 
consensus that standards of end-of-life care were patchy and that some 
hospices were providing excellent care while others were not.

Particular concern was expressed about patients being subjected to 
invasive treatment that offered no chance of preventing death and of 
people being put through unnecessary suffering by needlessly prolonging 
life.

It involves doctors withdrawing life-saving treatment, including fluids and drugs or putting patients on continuous sedation if they are deemed close to death. Death typically takes place within 29 hours, studies have found.

The idea was to allow terminal patients the opportunity to die with dignity whether they were at home, in hospital or being cared for at a hospice.

But the plan has been criticised by some experts and presented as a cost-cutting way to bring about the premature deaths of elderly patients.

In July ministers condemned the pathway as 'a national disgrace'.

An inquiry – led by Baroness Julia Neuberger – unearthed ‘distressing’ evidence of ‘desperate people', vindicating the Daily Mail’s persistent highlighting of relatives’ concerns last year.

Mrs Coleman has lodged a formal complaint with hospital bosses, also cataloging a string of basic-care failings, including a lack of compassion from staff.

Her dossier includes claims that her father was left to sleep in urine and faeces-stained sheets and that his call button was left out of his reach.

Doctors took the decision to place Mr Jee, who used to work for Thurrock Council, on the pathway on August 5.

They found they could no longer connect a food supply to feed the pensioner telling the family his organs were too badly damaged by his illness.

He was put into an induced coma and died four days later on August 8.

In September the Department of Health announced the hospital - which has been criticised by health inspectors for persistently high death rates - would be paired with the London's Royal Free Hospital in a bid to drive up care standards.

The trust is in the process of investigating what happened to Mr Jee.

A Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The trust appreciates that the past few 
months have been extremely difficult for Mr Jee's family, and has 
offered its apologies face-to-face in a meeting which took place on 
Tuesday, October 8. 

'The trust is committed to listening and learning.

'As discussed with the family, we will 
continue to have an open dialogue with them and will be providing them 
with a written response to their complaint once the investigations are 
completed.'

Baroness Juila Neuberger led a recent inquiry into the Liverpool Care Pathway, recommending it be phased out

In December 2012 it was revealed up to 60,000 patients die on the Liverpool Care Pathway each year without giving their consent, according to a joint study by the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute in Liverpool and the Royal College of Physicians.

A third of families are also kept in the dark when doctors withdraw lifesaving treatment from loved ones.

Records from 178 hospitals showed that thousands of people on the pathway are left to die in pain because nurses do not do enough to keep them comfortable while drugs are administered.

An estimated 130,000 patients are put on the pathway each year. Concerns have been raised that clinical judgments are being skewed by incentives for hospitals to use the pathway.

It emerged health trusts are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £30million for putting more patients on the LCP. Critics say it is a self-fulfilling prophecy because there is no scientific method of predicting when death will come.

MP Norman Lamb, the care services minister, launched a review in November 2012, saying there had been too many cases of families not being consulted.

In July, following an inquiry led by Baroness Julia Neuberger, ministers branded the LCP a 'national disgrace'.

The study unearthed 'distressing' evidence of 'desperate' people and vindicated a campaign run by the Daily Mail to highlight relatives' concerns last year.

It found families whose loved ones were put on the pathway suffered ‘poor care, appalling communications and of a lack of attention or compassion’. The inquiry heard ‘heartbreaking accounts of people desperately sucking at sponges used to moisten their mouths’.

In all, the scathing report made 44 recommendations – including plans to phase out the LCP in favour of a reformed system based on individualised ‘End of Life Care Plans’.In future:

Relatives of people who died on the LCP have broadly welcomed the inquiry and the Government’s promise to put its recommendations into operation. But they questioned how the replacement care plans would work.

Lady Neuberger said ‘the LCP was designed for the best reasons and absolutely the right principles lay behind it’. However, she said it had become a ‘tick-box exercise’.

Insisting on a complete overhaul, she called for an end to the cash incentives – revealed by the Daily Mail and paid to hospitals that hit targets for numbers of patients on the pathway.

She said the cash raised the ‘suspicion that people are being hastened towards death to help the financial situation of the trust’.

But while the report said the Liverpool Care Pathway should be phased out in six to 12 months, it left few details of the proposed replacement ‘End of Life Care Plans’.

Lady Neuberger said a new system of ‘guides and alerts’ should be individually tailored to patients, backed by medical professionals and patients, and inspected by the Care Quality Commission.
