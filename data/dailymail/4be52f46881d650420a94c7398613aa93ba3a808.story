The build-up to the 2013 Super League Grand Final was dominated by the imminent departure of Sam Tomkins — and 12 months on, the return of older brother Joel is catching the attention.

Sam duly bowed out of Wigan with a second Super League ring ahead of his move to the NRL and now Joel is aiming to match that in only his seventh match back in rugby league following a three-year stint in union with Saracens and England.

Joel Tomkins will be hoping to mark his return to rugby league with Super League Grand Final success

Tomkins has recently returned from a three-year spell playing for Saracens

The second rower was in the Warriors team that beat St Helens 22-10 at Old Trafford four years ago and says a repeat win on Saturday would complete a fairytale return.

‘Coming back 10 or 12 weeks ago, it was a bit of a dream then,’ he said. ‘It’s down to the hard work the boys have put in through the season, I’m lucky that I’ve jumped in on the back end of it.’

St Helens great Tom van Vollenhoven, 79, has flown from his home in South Africa to be the club’s special guest on Saturday. 

He will present the players with their Grand Final shirt at a private ceremony on Friday.

Tomkins is keen to follow in the footsteps of his brother Sam
