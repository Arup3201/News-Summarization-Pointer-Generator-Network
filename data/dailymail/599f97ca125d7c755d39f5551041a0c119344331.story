Vice President Joe Biden told a group of supporters on Monday that 'it's time to take back America' so that they can get an 'equal share.'

Both Biden and President Barack Obama dusted off the economic populist message that propelled them to a second term and  hit the road on Labor Day traveling to the union friendly cities of Detroit, Michigan, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to gin up support for a minimum wage increase.

Though a government-mandated raise in workers' wages has virtually no chance of passing 
Congress during the 12 days the legislature will be in session before Election Day,
 it's an issue that plays well with the voters the Obama administration 
is trying to turn out to vote in November's federal elections.

If Democrats are able to maintain control of the Senate and gain a 
majority in the House, the earliest point the president's party would be able to bring 
forward minimum wage legislation is January.

Biden argued today that Americans deserve a 'fair wage' so that they can send their children to college and purchase homes.

'Just give 
them a chance. No hand out. Just give them a chance,' he plead. 'Because once you 
give Americans a chance, they have never, never, never, never, ever let 
their country down, he said. 'Never.

'So folks, it's time to take back America, as 
we say. It's time to change the tax code. It's time to make sure you 
get equal share.'

President Obama took up his old refrain that average Americans deserves a 'fair shot' because not everyone was 'born with a silver spoon in their mouths.'

'I believe in the American Dream because I have lived it,' Obama said. 'And I 
ran for this office to restore it for everybody so no matter what you look like, and no matter where you came from, no matter how you started, you can make it in America if you try.'

Obama told attendees of his speech at Laborfest that sometimes people meet him in person and 'say I look taller than I do on TV. I say yeah ...that's because the TV's small. It makes me look smaller'

Obama's speech, which was chock-full of jokes, was a hit with his progressive audience

''I'm not asking for the moon. I just want a good deal for American workers!' he yelled, after referencing Republican lawmakers' opposition to raising the minimum wage.

'You know, the average person, they're not looking for a yacht. They're not looking for their own plane. They're not looking for a mansion. They don't need to be vacationing in St. Barts,' he said, pausing in between each one for laughter and applause from his audience, which was mostly comprised of union members.

'All they're looking for is that if they work hard, they can pay the bills. That they can send their kids to school. That they can retire with some dignity. Maybe take a vacation once and awhile,' he said. 'They ain't looking for nothing fancy.'

Obama noted the difficulty he's had moving his agenda this afternoon, claiming that 'every inch of it we've had to work against a lock step opposition that is opposed to everything we do.

'But it was worth it. Every gray hair is worth it,' he said pointing to his head.

'And at least, I've still got some hair,' he added, to which an audience member told him that he still looks good.

'See, I like that,' the president replied. 'Thank you.'

The president used the light-hearted moment to crack a joke about how 'surprised' people are when they meet him in person and find he looks better than they expected.

'And then sometimes they say I look taller than I do on TV,' Obama added.

'I say yeah ...that's because the TV's small. It makes me look smaller,' he said to laughter before returning to the topic at hand.

Obama told attendees of his Laborfest speech that 'the only thing more powerful than an idea whose time has come is when millions of people are organizing around an idea whose time has come.

'Millions of people are voting for an idea whose time has come,' he said, firing up the crowd.

Obama acknowledged that life isn't always fair, and 'sometimes you get a half a loaf where you wanted a whole loaf.

'Sometimes you might just get a quarter of a loaf,' he noted.

But the president asked his supporters to trust him just as they did in 2008 'to bring about the change we need.' He also encouraged them to believe in their own power to make a difference.

 'I’m asking you to believe in you.  Because even when our politics just ain’t right, there’s a whole lot that is right with America,' he said.

'America is not the party we belong to, but the values we share. America is hard work. America is responsibility.  America is sacrifice. America is looking out for one another,' Obama said. 'Let’s embrace some economic patriotism that says we rise or fall together as one nation, as one people.'

Noting that 'cynicism is fashionable these days,' Obama counseled his fans not to give up on America.

'Cynicism didn’t put anybody on the moon. Cynicism never won a war, it never cured a disease, it never started a business, it never fed a young mind, it never built a road or a bridge,' he said.

'Cynicism is a bad choice. Hope is the better choice.'
