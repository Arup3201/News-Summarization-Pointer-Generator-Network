The desk used by Hitler to work on his plans for the most evil crimes in history has been discovered.

The Nazi dictator used the simple office desk, which was made in 1937, in his ornate Reichschancellery in Berlin throughout the Second World War while his Alsatian Blondi slept at his feet beneath it.

German officials say the desk became the property of the Americans after the war and was used as just another piece of furniture in a rest home for US soldiers in Berlin between 1957 and 1996. They even installed telephone and fax connections to its side.

The desk belonging to Adolf Hitler was discovered in a government storeroom in Germany

The furniture was handed over to American authorities at the end of the war and was returned to the German government around 2000

The Nazi dictator used the desk to formulate his genocidal plans, however German authorities said they will never sell the item

It was passed back to Germany in 1996 and has been kept in a storeroom since. Officials say it will never be sold, even though collectors would pay thousands for it.

The desk was made in 1937, has four lockable drawers and was used continuously by Hitler until the end of the war.

Hanging on one side is an outdated ticket reading: 'This item is the property of the United States and falls under the Potsdam Agreement.'

The desk, along with much else besides, formed part of the fixtures and fittings of a rest home for U.S. soldiers in Berlin between 1957 and 1996. Its general manager, Norman Marcus, was responsible for the electrical upgrades fitted to its side.

Some time around 2000 the desk was returned to the German government.

It now resides in a storeoom in Weissensee near Berlin. This is the first time it has been pictured since the war years.

Germany says it will never be sold, even though it would fetch tens of thousands of pounds to a militaria collector. 'The desk is, and remains, the property of the Federal Republic,' said government spokeswoman Jacqueline Besse.
