The French government has launched a smartphone app designed to help boost women's self-esteem at work to help close the gender pay gap.

Leadership Pour Elles has been launched to mark France's Equal Pay Day - the date in the calendar when women's earnings catch up with those of men in the previous year.

Touted as a tool to help women learn to assert themselves at work, it can be downloaded for free from the Ministry for Women's Rights website, as well as from the Google and Apple app stores.

Self-esteem: Tthe new Leadership Pour Elles smartphone app, which is designed to help boost women's assertiveness at work. French Women's Rights minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem launched the app yesterday

A release marking the launch of the 
app cites research claiming that men are nine times more likely to ask 
for a pay rise than their female colleagues.

Self-confidence
 can explain up to 4.5 percentage points of the 25 per cent wage gap 
between men and women, according to the French government.

Launching the app yesterday, Najat Belkacem-Vallaud, Minister Women's Rights, said: 'It's on confidence that we must act, giving all women the tools that were previously the preserve of senior executives belonging to the networks of the Grandes Ecoles.'

She was referring to the network of elite universities from which are drawn candidates for the top positions of France's corporate and public sectors.

The application provides 'simple effective advice, detailed and free,' she added, describing it as 'coaching for all'.

Detailed: The app, designed by government officials with the help of experts from women's business networks, begins with a questionnaire to assess users self-esteem and the areas in which they might need help

The app calls on women to be more confident about asserting their ambitions and dispense with the 'self-censorship' which denies them the opportunity to realise their professional potential.

France's Equal Pay Day is a date designed to symbolise the country's gender pay gap by marking the 433 days a woman would have to work to catch up with what a male colleage earns in 365 days.

The app has been designed by government officials with the help of experts from women's business networks. It begins with a questionnaire to assess users self-esteem and the areas in which they might need help.

They are asked, among other questions, how they would react to a male colleague's derogatory comments during a business meeting.

It calls on women to take to heart the philosophy of artist Vincent van Gogh, who said: 'What would life be like if we didn't have the courage to try anything?'

It also offers advice on public speaking, power dressing and body language.

'Inclusive, it is of course also available to men,' a spokesman says.
