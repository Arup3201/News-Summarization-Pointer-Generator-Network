The pregnant stepmother of a five-year-old boy who was found starved and covered in bruises after allegedly being locked under the stairs has lost custody of her six biological children.

Tammie Bleimeyer, 33, appeared in a Houston court on Tuesday to try to bring her kids home but a judge handed them over to Child Protective Services and ordered her to have no contact with them.

It came after she claimed to be unaware of the boy's horrific condition - which was captured in a series of disturbing images - because she had not seen him with his shirt off recently. Â

But Bleimeyer and her husband Bradley Bleimeyer, 24 - the boy's father - were charged with felony child endangerment after one of her teenage sons called cops on March 29 and said the young boy, Jordan Bleimeyer, had not been fed properly.

Earlier this month, she claimed that she never mistreated the child and that she and her husband separated last summer.

Her
 ex no longer lives at her home in Spring, Texas, Tammie Bleimeyer said,
 but took Jordan to live in Alabama. Mrs Bleimeyer filed 
for divorce last month from her husband of two years.

Tammie Bleimeyer previously told KHOU: 'I was shocked. I have never seen him look like that and I have never seen him with his shirt off recently.'

However she doesn't necessarily believe that her estranged husband caused the child's condition.

The 33-year-old added: 'I don't know what caused him to 
look like that. I don't know if it's a health issue or something else 
like that. I don't want to be like everyone else and assume 
the worse.'

Arrest: The boy's father Bradley Bleimeyer has also been charged with child endangerment

Police 
discovered a locked closet with
 a mattress at the Bleimeyer home after being called following a 
disturbance last month between Bradley Bleimeyer and his 16-year-old 
stepson.

The little boy, who weighs just 29lb, told his mom and grandmother that he was padlocked in a closet under the stairs at the Texas home.

He was given just a piece of bread and a cup of water or milk each day and fed drugs when visitors came to the house to keep him quiet.

The child was taken to Texas Children's Hospital for treatment.

His frail body was photographed covered in bumps and bruises with a deep cut on his right shoulder.

His biological mother, Windy Hall, is now seeking custody of the boy, who is currently being cared for by members of her family. She was reunited with him after he was saved from the home.

She told KHOU: 'It was the most 
amazing thing. It was like giving birth again, it was amazing, he knew 
who I was. I tried not to cry, I have to be strong for him.'

She
 said that her son has eaten spaghetti and a grilled cheese. But she 
said that he constantly looks around him when he's eating like someone 
is going to take the food away.

Strangers have been sending Jordan presents thanks to a Facebook group, Toys for Jordan.

A custody hearing will be held on April 21.
