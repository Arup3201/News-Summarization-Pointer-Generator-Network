The elephant that inspired the Save The Elephants charity has been found dead after poachers ripped his tusks from his skull.

Mountain Bull, a 46-year-old African elephant, was found in Mount Kenya forest last week after his GPS tracker installed by conservationists stalled.

He is thought to have been dead for eight days.

Tragic: Mountain Bull, the 46-year-old creature that inspired Save The Elephants, has been found dead

The six-tonne elephant became the face of the Save The Elephants campaign in October 2012.

Prone to ploughing down anything from huge trees to man-made barriers, he had been attracting the attention of poachers for years.

In a desperate bid to protect the magnificent creature, conservationists gave Mountain Bull a tracking device to identify his natural migration path.

They then built a 'wildlife corridor' between Mount Kenya and the northern rangelands, previously blocked by human development.

And to dissuade him from crushing fences, they sawed off part of his tusks.

A spokesman for Lewa Wildlife Conservancy project in North Kenya said: 'Mountain Bull’s death is a great loss to the conservation fraternity.

'He taught us much about elephant and animal behaviour, migration routes and patterns, and to a large extent, left many inspired by his bravery and resilience.'
