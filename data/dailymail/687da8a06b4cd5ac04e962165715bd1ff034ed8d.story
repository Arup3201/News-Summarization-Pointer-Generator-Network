A schoolboy who suffered bullying over his protruding ears has gone back to school with a smile on his face after an operation by a top plastic surgeon.

Ashley Watson, seven, was on the receiving end of cruel taunts from other youngsters after he was born without cartilage in part of his ears.

His parents said he took to constantly wearing a hood and did not want to go out to play in case he was mocked.

But after a kind-hearted surgeon heard of his plight and offered to operate for free, Ashley's family say he has returned to school with a new-found confidence.

Before: Ashley Watson suffered cruel taunts from other children after he was born without cartilage in his ears

After: When the NHS removed funding for an operation to alter the schoolboy's ears, a generous surgeon offered to do the procedure for free

The youngster, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, was left heartbroken earlier this year when funding was withdrawn for an operation to alter the shape of his ears.

But after his plight was reported in his local newspaper, plastic surgeon Dr Paul Baguley offered to operate for free at York's Nuffield Hospital.

Dr Baguley told the Daily Express: 'I knew for four or five hours of my life, I could change his life for 80 years.'

Following the operation, Ashley's parents Craig and Nicola have seen a huge change in his confidence and say he returned to school this week with much higher self-esteem.

Training manager Craig, 33, told the Evening Gazette earlier this year: 'He is brilliant after the operation. He's really happy now. He wanted this in the first place and it was him fighting for it. We are just unbelievably proud of him.'

The NHS says about one in 100 people suffer from protruding ears, which cause particular difficulties for children as they are one of the first parts of the body to develop to full adult size.

As well as embarrassment, they can cause problems with wearing certain types of head gear, such as motorbike helmets and hard-hats.

Financial support for treating protruding ears varies considerably between different NHS trusts.

Many trusts don't offer corrective procedures for purely cosmetic reasons, with others requesting psychological reports before agreeing to fund treatment.

Happy: Ashley's parents say he has returned to school a much more confident boy after the procedure
