A pioneering NHS surgeon is helping Syrian bomb blast victims walk again by creating prosthetic limbs - made from drainpipes and tyres.

Viquar Qurashi has created 114 makeshift false legs for amputees who have been injured during the bloody conflict in the war-torn country. 

Mr Qurashi, a surgeon at Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley, West Midlands, uses his spare time to create the prostheses using a groundbreaking technique.

Pioneering: Surgeon Viquar Qurashi. from Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley, is helping Syrian bomb blast victims get back on their feet by creating prosthetic limbs made from drainpipes and tyres

He melts down the drainpipes - which are donated by a Turkish businessman - in a furnace before sculpting them into leg-shapes around a mould of each victim

He then fashions artificial feet using recycled rubber taken from car tyres

He spends up to a day-and-a-half melting down the drainpipes - which are donated by a Turkish businessman - in a furnace before sculpting them into leg-shapes around a mould of each victim.

He then fashions artificial feet using recycled rubber taken from car tyres. 

It means the process can produce an artificial limb which usually costs the NHS £1,200 - for just £30.

Mr Qurashi flew out to Reyhanli - on the Turkish Syrian border - two weeks ago to fit them to victims using metal pins and leather straps. 

He is helped by a team of six technicians from Pakistan in a makeshift clinic and workshop to help those hurt by the two-year war that has so-far claimed 70,000 lives.

Mr Qurashi, from Dudley, said yesterday: "I became involved in this in 2007 after the earthquake in my home country of Pakistan.

'I flew back to help and ended up doing hundreds of amputations.

'Afterwards I realised nothing was being done for them after the amputation.

'They would be left to either become beggars or to die in hospitals of bed sores.

One of the 114 beneficaries is seven-year-old Hussain Mubarak, from Pakistan

Then and now: Mr Qurashi feared not enough was being done to help amputees such as Hussain

Up and about: The limbs will last up to seven years and even if they break, they are not difficult to replace

'We're very lucky in the west, we have things like the NHS to help us through, but other in the less developed countries they have nothing, and their corrupt governments don't care enough about them.

'The limbs we have in the west are very good, but far too expensive, but after some research I found a similar technique had been developed in Pakistan in 1962.

'I modified it and realised that it could be done really cheaply to give these people their lives back.

'The limbs will last up to seven years and even if they break it's not hard to replace them.

'They are not as sophisticated as a western limb but a prosthetic limb costing up to a £1,000 here in Britain will be of little use to someone who doesn't have the money, technology and tools to maintain it.

'We can make limbs from drainpipe material for £30 and provide them free to those in need.

'The patients go back to their profession, to study, they go back to colleges, university, take up jobs.

Basic: Mr Qurashi said that while the limbs aren't highly sophisticated, they work well for people in poorer countries who don't have the money or technology to maintain them

'A group of ten volunteers and training technicians from Syria have been selected to take up this job in future.

'I would say it is like comparing a 1962 Skoda to a Mercedes Benz, they both work as cars, so there is no shame.'

In 2005, Mr Qurashi set up the Naya Qadam Trust, non-profit organisation of volunteer overseas Pakistani doctors, which helps fund the artificial limb materials.

He hopes to take the limbs to other countries such as Haiti, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Vietnam.

Paula Clark, Chief Executive of The Dudley Hospital Group said, 'We are very proud of Mr Qurashi and his altruistic work with amputees in Syria.

'It demonstrates the commitment and dedication of all staff who work for the Trust.'
