An advertisement for the anti-ageing pill Imedeen, which is promoted by supermodel Christy Turlington, has been banned.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has ruled the manufacture behind the wonder pills, Pfizer, failed to provide convincing research or evidence that they work.

The US drugs company has invested millions in the pills and supplied a raft of research it claimed backed up marketing for the pills that they helped cure fine lines and wrinkles from within.

Model Christy Turlington, 45, was hired in January this year at great expense as a model and ambassador for the Imedeen brand around the world

However, the ASA said none of these were sufficiently robust and reliable to show the effects claimed.

The ruling is serious blow for Pfizer, which earlier this year was at the centre of a controversial and eventually unsuccessful bid to buy the British drugs company AstraZeneca.

It is also embarrassing for Turlington, 45, who was hired in January this year at great expense as a model and ambassador for the brand around the world.

When she took up the post, she spoke in glowing terms about the wonder pills, saying: ‘It’s very important for me to maintain great looking skin – not only as a model, but as a woman with lots of demands and many roles to fill each day.

‘Caring for my skin on the inside is just as important as how I care for the outside and I can count on Imedeen to deliver deep down nourishment where it matters most.’ 

A regional press ad for the skincare tablet stated: ‘Imedeen - Beautiful skin begins within. Award-winning skincare in a tablet.’ 

It boasted that the pill was the winner of several consumer and beauty awards and that the brand had been ‘pioneering skincare from within since 1991’.

It said the product was a: ‘Natural-based, scientifically tested skincare formulations for different ages that work from within to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.’ 

When Turlington took the job, she said: 'It's very important for me to maintain great looking skin ¿ not only as a model, but as a woman'

The ASA asked Pfizer to provide evidence that the pills had the anti-ageing properties claimed to establish whether they were accurate and complied with EU health claims rules.

The company provided six studies which were then assessed by an independent expert to understand whether the pills really do ‘work from within to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles’.

The ASA said the expert considered that three of the studies were not adequate substantiation, because they did not use the standard scientific procedures involving control groups where the skin of women who did not use the pills was compared against those that did.

One of the studies consisted of only six participants, two with medical conditions that might have affected the skin or general health. In addition, pre and post treatment grading pictures were not assessed for two of the six participants.

The ASA said the rest of the research supplied by the company was confusing and difficult to interpret.

The watchdog said: ‘The studies involved three, four and six-month trials with the results measured by clinical grading, self-evaluation and visual imaging techniques, but did not use methods to assess direct measures of wrinkles before or after treatment.’ 

In many cases the women involved in the trials did not see any beneficial effects. Even tests to measure the skin thickness of the women involved did not show a clear benefit of taking the tablets.

The ASA said: ‘We considered that the reports provided were not sufficiently robust to support the claim ‘worked from within to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles” and concluded that the claim was misleading.’

The complaint was brought by the Labour peer Lord Lipsey, who is chairman of the All-Party Statistics Group, which is campaigning for the honest use of figures and research.

He welcomed the ASA ruling saying: ‘This comprehensively demolishes the studies the company cited in support of its claim. 

‘This advert sought to exploit human vanity and human credulousness. This case underlines how right Labour was to ask searching questions about Pfizer when it attempted to take over AstraZeneca.’

Matt Dawson's advertisement has been banned by the ASA for being misleading

A TV advert for a superfood promoted by former England rugby international Matt Dawson has been banned because it wrongly boasted of its nutritional values.

In the ad for Bioglan Superfoods Chia and Flax seeds Dawson told viewers ‘Have you discovered the power of a Bioglan superfood that you can add to your diet every day? It's highly nutritious.’

The ad went on to claim by adding it to your breakfast consumers would get ‘as much protein as a small egg: more calcium than 100ml of milk; as much fibre as a cup of oats, and a high source of the Omega 3 fatty acid.’

Dawson concluded, ‘The pure goodness of a Bioglan superfood is a great addition to a healthy diet. It’s so simple, and easy to enjoy. Bioglan superfood: good nutrition for you.’

However the advertising watchdog upheld complaints that it broke EU rules on what a ‘superfood’ actually is. It said: ‘We considered the emphasis of the ad was on the comparative nutrition claims and not the specific health claims and that the ad was therefore presented in such a way that suggested it was comparative nutrition claims that supported the "superfood" general health claim, when this was not the case.'

They ordered that the advertisement should not appear again in its current form.
