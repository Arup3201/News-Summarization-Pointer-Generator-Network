A prestigious home in one of Sydney's most exclusive suburbs is on the market for $6 million more than it was asking for just eight months ago.

Bought by property investor and dentist Le Tran in June for $14 million, the grand six-bedroom mansion at 9 Hillside Avenue Vaucluse in Sydney's eastern suburbs is now being offered for $20 million following a large-scale renovation.

'There have been extensive renovations done, it has basically been completely rebuilt inside, virtually,' Black Diamondz estate agent Brad Pillinger told Daily Mail Australia.

The exclusive mansion at 9 Hillside Avenue Vaucluse in Sydney's eastern suburbs has been put on the market for $20 million

This is despite it last being purchased by dentist and property investor Le Tran only eight months ago for $14 million 

Black Diamondz estate agent Brad Pillinger said that extensive renovations had been done to the home's interior since it was purchased

'The floors, walls, appliances - basically everything. The whole internal layout has been re-done.'

When asked if he believed it would snatch-up its multi-million dollar target, Mr Pillinger replied 'It'll go close'.

Le Tran purchased the home from property developer Jacques Kurdian whose father bought it in 1976 for less than 1.5 per cent of the cost - $220,000, according to Review Property.

But despite Le Tran selling his last home in Hunters Hill for $12.5 million before buying the exclusive, water-front home, Mr Pillinger said he hasn't even moved in.

'They have in mind a particular property they want to buy,' the estate agent said when asked by Daily Mail Australia for the reason of Le Tran's quick re-sale. 

'The floors, walls, appliances - basically everything. The whole internal layout has been re-done,' he told Daily Mail Australia 

The home features five bathrooms, a resort-style swimming pool, spa, sauna, wide terraces and a pool-side dining patio

Le Tran purchased the home from property developer Jacques Kurdian whose father bought it in 1976 for almost one 10th of the cost

'The renovation has been finished and they were about to move in but they changed their mind and put it on the market.'

With an enormous 1808 square metre land size and panoramic views of Sydney Harbour, it's no wonder that the castle-like home has had 'a lot of initial interest', according to Mr Pillinger.

'It has an unequal view of everything that is iconic in Sydney and it's particularly private.'

The home features five bathrooms, a resort-style swimming pool, spa, sauna, wide terraces and a pool-side dining patio.

Designed in a classical French provincial theme, it takes full advantage of its hill-top position by including  a stunning panoramic view which stretches right to Bondi Beach in one of the upper level bedrooms.
