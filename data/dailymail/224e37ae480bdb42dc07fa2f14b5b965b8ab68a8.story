Former Education Secretary Michael Gove warned of the danger of letting school pupils be radicalised

Hardline Islamists involved in a ‘Trojan Horse’ plot to radicalise pupils are still working in Birmingham schools, a teaching union boss has claimed.

Rob Kelsall, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the union was investigating 28 secret deals with school principals - amid fears that some may have been forced out of their jobs unfairly by radical governors.

The union said at least three so-called 'compromise agreements' had ‘all the hallmarks of Trojan Horse pressures’.

Mr Kelsall’s remarks came as a former headteacher of a school implicated in the Trojan Horse plot was reinstated.

Ms Bhupinder Kondal returned as principal of Oldknow Academy in Small Heath - the school she left in January after claiming she had been undermined by those trying to impose a narrow Muslim ethos.

Governors implicated in the government report into the Trojan Horse scandal – compiled by former Scotland Yard counter terror chief Peter Clarke – have either been removed or forced to resign.

But the head teachers’ union chief Rob Kelsall today revealed he was worried others involved in the plot had gone unnoticed.

He said: ‘I remain concerned that there are still people not named in Peter Clarke’s report still operating in Birmingham schools.’

But he added: ‘I have more confidence that complaints will be taken seriously.’

Mr Kelsall called on Birmingham city council to act on the cases of three head teachers allegedly ousted by Trojan Horse plotters.

Governors at Satley School were accused of  'refusing to accept that the school is in a state of crisis' while governors at Oldknow Academy used the school's budget to subsidise a trip to Saudi Arabia for only Muslim staff and pupils.

The Golden Hillock School and Nansen Primary School were both branded 'inadequate' in the new inspections

Speaking on her return to Oldknow, Ms Bhupinder Kondal said it was ‘like getting a new job.’

‘I am glad to be back doing the job I love,’ she said.

‘The pressures outlined in the Trojan Horse letter are very real and it mustn’t be allowed to happen again.’

The Department for Education said a decision to stop funding the school in the light of the Trojan Horse inquiry is now likely to be reversed.

A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: ‘There are no current legal proceedings from head teachers, though we are in continued dialogue with the NAHT and are reviewing key cases as recommended by the Ian Kershaw review.’
