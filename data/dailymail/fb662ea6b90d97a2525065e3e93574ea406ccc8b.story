The body of Cassandra Gittens-Bishop lay in a field for hours after she lost control of her car following a boozy internet date

A young mother lay undiscovered in a field for hours after she drunkenly crashed her car and died.

Cassandra Gittens-Bishop, known to 
her friends as Cassy, had spent the evening with a man she had met on 
the internet but when she became drunk, date Tom Westley dropped her 
home.

After the 22-year-old said goodbye to Mr Westley and he drove away, she began to scream loudly inside her home in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, so much so that worried neighbours called the police.

Officers left after she calmed down, only for her next door neighbour Tracy Watmore to notice that Miss Gittens-Bishop was trying to drive off in her car and she heard the woman stall the vehicle several times.

Mrs Watmore called police to warn them that she thought Miss Gittens-Bishop was trying to drive drunk, and although officers arrived in the street almost immediately and began their search, it was not until nearly six hours later that her body was discovered by a passing cyclist.

She had lost control of her car and span off a road, crashing into a field with the vehicle spinning nearly three times before coming to rest on its side.

The cyclist who discovered her dialled 999 and paramedics rushed to the scene but they found that she was already dead.

Blood tests revealed that her blood alcohol level had been 225mg in 100ml of blood - around three times the drink-driving limit.

She also had traces of cocaine in her blood, although police scientists could not tell if Cassy had taken a small amount of the drug shortly before her death, or a larger amount earlier.

Happier times: Miss Gittens-Bishop with friends on a night out. She asphyxiated in her car after crashing in a field

The inquest at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, was told that the evening before her death, in the early hours of Friday, November 25 last year, Cassy had been out with Mr Westley, who she had previously met up with around six or seven times.

Mr Westley had driven, and so had not been drinking, but said that his date had drunk most of a bottle of wine, two Jaegerbombs, a glass of Champagne and a double vodka and coke.

'She was drunk,' he said.

Mr Westley confirmed that Miss Gittens-Bishop had asked him to take her to a friend’s house in Bedford but he had refused and instead took her home before he drove away at around 12.15am.

Neighbour Mrs Watmore said that police were called to the house shortly afterwards as they had heard her screaming and throwing items around her home.

'It sounded like there was fighting going on, or she was throwing stuff - things were getting thrown around. There was a lot of banging,' she said.

Police arrived and Mrs Watmore said that Miss Gittens-Bishop seemed to calm down and could be heard laughing with the officers.

The officers then left, when Mrs Watmore saw her neighbour get into her car, and pull out of the driveway, only to stall.

'It was like the handbrake was on, she couldn’t move the car forward,' she said.

'I wasn’t sure if she had been drinking, you don’t drive off with a handbrake on. I wanted reassurance so I rang the police as I was worried whether she should be driving.'

Officers returned to the street after Mrs Watmore’s call, but Cassy had already driven away.

Her car was picked up on an automatic number plate camera at 1.36am on the A600 road towards Bedford, but there was no further sign of her until shortly before 7am when her body was discovered, still in the car, in a nearby field by the cyclist.

Troubled: The inquest heard that Miss Gittens-Bishop had been a regular user of cocaine in the month prior to her death and had a history of mental health problems and erratic behaviour, causing police to frequently be called out to her home

She still had the seatbelt on and was in the driving seat, although the car had flipped onto the passenger's side.

A post mortem examination revealed that Cassy had died from asphyxia due to the position she had ended up in inside the car but that she had been unconscious prior to this, with her alcohol level a contributing factor.

Road traffic investigators concluded that Cassy, who was travelling at the 60mph speed limit, had lost control on a gentle bend and had come off the road when she tried to compensate and over-steered.

The inquest heard that Cassy had been a regular user of cocaine in the month prior to her death, as well as a history of mental health problems and erratic behaviour - causing police to frequently be called out to her home.

Hertfordshire deputy coroner Graham Danbury recorded that the death had been an accident, adding that the crash had 'distressing results'.
