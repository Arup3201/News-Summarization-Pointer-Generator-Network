It could be the ultimate ocean going retreat - with a 'party deck' hull specially designed to keep your martini safe at all times.

Rather than a sleek yacht, Lockheed Martin is hoping someone will instead prefer an experimental navy vessel built to endure travel through rough seas at high speed.

The experimental boat can remain stable and travel at high speeds in waves upto twelve feet high - although its triple deck bunk beds do leave it in need of a little interior design.

The ship has an advanced hull designed for outstanding stability and speed in high sea states and is capable of 30-plus knots in wave heights of up to 12 feet.

The ultimate party deck? The boat has a large rear desk which remains stable even in 12 foot waves

The 105-ft (32-m) long, 55-ft (17-m) wide, 180-ton (163-tonne) watercraft features two 3,480 hp diesel engines, two 180-kW Caterpillar diesel electric generators, and  a top speed of 30 knots (56 km/h, or 35 mph). 

It is now on sale for $180,000 online, and is currently in San Diego.

The pictures of it show six bunks and a rather minimalist kitchen, so it could be described as needing work.

It also has a shower-equipped bathroom, plus a washer and dryer.

'Sea SLICE, designated as a High Speed Vessel (HSV) for the exercise, is demonstrating the flexibility achievable by 'modularity' in a small, fast, highly maneuverable platform,' the Navy wrote when it first trialled the ship.

Buyers may want to redecorate the craft, which comes with three tier bunkbeds and a rather minimalist kitchen area

'The joint high speed vessel (experimental) Joint Venture (HSV-X1) has been evaluating the potential of fast, shallow draft, open architecture, multi-mission vessels with large payload fractions in the areas of mine warfare, special operations, ship-to-objective maneuver and medical and non-combatant support operations.'

Some of its weapons tested during FBE-J include the joint Lockheed Martin and Oerlikon Contraves 35mm Millennium Gun and the NetFires System and launcher, intended to launch Loitering Attack Munitions (LAM) - although these have now been removed.
