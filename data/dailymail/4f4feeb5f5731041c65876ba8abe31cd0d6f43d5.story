Kim Sears has finally joined in the excitement surrounding the US Open tennis championships, held at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York.

The 25-year-old girlfriend of Andy Murray, usually so expressive when watching her partner, has been looking decidedly glum and stony-faced during the Grand Slam thus far, despite Andy’s success.

But last night, on day eight of the tournament, Kim was back to her old demonstrative self as she watched Andy play Wilfred Tsonga of France.

The 25-year-old could barely contain her joy at her boyfriends successes on court

Andy's every racket swing and serve was reflected on Kim's face - and at times - her body

The young artist could barely contain herself as her boyfriend of eight years served his way to victory – quite literally jumping out of her seat at times.

And while her face was a picture of joy and exhilaration, her fashion choices for the day were rather more relaxed.

Usually smartly-attired in Sloane Ranger classics, Kim opted for a much more casual outfit.

Teaming a pair of jeans with a cream T-shirt emblazoned with the words ‘Dreamy’ over a lace camisole, Kim finished off her outfit with a pair of black Ray-Bans.

While her outfit was casual, Kim's hair looked as perfect as ever  

Her outfit may have been casual but her accessories certainly weren't as she carried a £1,600 Mulberry tote

But while her clothes were laid-back, Kim upped the fashion ante with some serious arm candy.

She accessorised her low-key look with a £1,600 peach leather Mulberry Willow bag slung over her arm.

Kim was last seen on day four of the championships when she watched Murray bear Bachinger, though her mood appeared very different.

Despite Murray winning in straight sets, Kim’s face remaining as poker-straight as her hair as she watched Andy win 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in one hour and 46 minutes.

With her heavy eye make-up only serving to emphasis her glum expression, Kim barely cracked a smile.
