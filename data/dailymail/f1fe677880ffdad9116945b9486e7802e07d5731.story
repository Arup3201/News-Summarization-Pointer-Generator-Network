Star University of Central Florida quarterback Blake Bortles is just a junior and already a hot NFL draft prospect, but its his girlfriend Lindsey Duke who's stealing all the headlines.

The beautiful, blonde model was profiled on ESPN and has since seen a surge in her online following to rival that of her NFL bound beau.

While the talented athlete gets a not so shabby 225,000 results when searched on Google, his buxom girlfriend's name returns over 6 million.

Curiosity and outright envy surrounding the couple, often seen beaming arm-in-arm in Twitter and Instagram pics, has reached a fever pitch since Bortles' Fiest Bowl victory on Wednesday.

Leading up to that victory, ESPN reporter Gene Wojciechowski told Bortles' coach George O'Leary about the discrepancy in the couple's internet fame.

'I would hope as a head coach that the numbers would be reversed,' O'Leary said, 'but obviously you haven’t seen his girlfriend. She deserves six million Googles.'

Social butterfly: Duke has a habit of frequently posting pictures of herself and her friends in bikinis to Instagram and Twitter, helping pave her path to success

Duke has helped pave her own way to fame with constant bikini-clad updates to her Twitter and Instagram feeds.

Off the field as well as on, Bortles is one lucky guy and doesn't seem particulary fazed by his girlfriend's popularity.

'Apparently, she is more of a household name than I am,' Bortles told ESPN. 'She’s more famous than me and there’s nothing I can do about that.'

He's had time to get used to her appeal. They've been a couple since high school, where they attended prom together, and then attended the same university.

Duke is set to graduate this year, which has many wondering if she'll be greeted with the same offers of modeling and television show gigs as the most beloved college football girlfriend of 2013 Katherine Webb.

Duke's popularity places her in league with Katherine Webb, the former Miss Alabama and girlfriend of 2013 draft favorite A.J. McCarron who rose to fame after being spotted in the stands by an ESPN cameraman

Webb, who was Miss Alabama 2012, was basically spotted in the stands by ESPN this time last year as she cheered on her boyfriend of one month A.J. McCarron.

The promising Alabama quarterback's spotlight quickly swung to Webb, who has since appeared in television commercials, a reality televsion series, and on the computer screens of a huge chunk of the American male populace.

While Webb's rise to fame came quickly and almost out of nowhere, she and Duke both have another football beauty forebearer to thank for their success.

In 2012, the breakout female star of the NFL draft was Lauren Tannehill.

Featured on ESPN's draft coverage that year, the aspiring model and wife of the Miami Dolphin's pick Ryan Tannehill was a major hit, setting social networking sites abuzz with complimentary tweets.

In the first ten minutes after Texas A&M quarterback Tannehill was picked with the eighth overall selection, the cardiology assistant began trending on Twitter and picked up 3,000 followers overnight, a 350 percent increase on the day before.
