A police officer claimed £69,000 on top of his basic annual salary to take home £109,000

A police officer claimed £69,000 on top of his basic annual salary taking home £109,000 in one year, it has been revealed.

The unknown police sergeant, employed by the Metropolitan Police, was earning an annual wage of £40,000, but ended up taking home a sum three times that, figures from a Freedom of Information request show.

Meanwhile, another police officer from the same force topped up his £30,000 salary by £55,000, The Sun said.

The Met pays out the most in police 
overtime out of all the police forces in England and Wales, paying out £109million last year.

On average London officers get 
£4,000 in overtime a year.

Just under 100 officers working in jobs including armed and royal protection, regularly claim more than 100 hours a month which boots their annual salary by around £36,000 each.

In March, it was revealed that police overtime payments averaged
a million pounds a day over the past decade and were part of the 
service’s  ‘culture’.

In ten years forces paid out £3.8billion to their officers for working extra hours.

The overtime bill for the taxpayer has nearly doubled since 2000, despite huge increases in the number of full-time officers.

The Met said policing the riots in the capital in August cost £23million in officer overtime payments.

A Met spokesman said overtime is 'called upon when essential to operational effectiveness'.

Meanwhile,
other figures show a constable working for the Police Service of 
Northern Ireland was paid an additional £43,000 in overtime, and another sergeant clocked 
up £57,000.

In the West Midlands, one police constable was paid £35,000 more and another sergeant took home £37,500 on top of his basic wage.

Tory MP Aidan Burley said that overtime in some forces had become institutionalised and said the system needed reform.

The Daily Mail last week revealed how more than 3,000 London police officers have a second job which they perform outside their duties, new figures reveal.

They are working part-time as masseuses, hairdressers, models, hypnotherapists, antiques dealers and film extras.

In total, the Metropolitan Police register of second jobs shows there 
are 3,041 officers – nearly one in ten of the entire 31,000 force –  who
have outside business interests.

This compares with just 444 (1.5 per 
cent) of London-based policemen and women who made the same declaration 
in 2005.
