Michael Sata has promised to turn around the poor southern African country's fortunes within 90 days

A former cleaner at Victoria Station has become president of Zambia.

Michael Sata, 74, who has vowed to 
'sweep my country even cleaner' than he kept the London railway 
platforms, was sworn in as leader yesterday after a narrow election 
victory.

The chain-smoking father of eight campaigned against the growing influence of China in his mineral-rich country.

He accused outgoing President Rupiah 
Banda, whose party had been in power for 20 years, of being soft on 
corruption and vowed to share Zambia's huge mineral wealth more fairly.

Mr Sata, known as King Cobra for his 
venomous turn of phrase, was born in Zambia when it was still the 
British colony known as Northern Rhodesia.

He came to London in the 1950s and found work as a cleaner and then porter for British Rail.

He studied part-time and took casual jobs at car assembly plants before returning home and joining the police force.

Mr Sata, who refuses to drink bottled
 water until all Zambians have access to clean water, worked under two 
presidents before breaking with the ruling party to form his opposition 
Patriotic Front. 

Rise to power: Mr Sata's swearing-in yesterday

He quickly won support from mill- ions of Zambians who continue to live in poverty, despite the nation's natural wealth.

China has a massive presence in the 
country, Africa's biggest copper producer, but refuses to employ 
Zambians or use local products.

Instead, Chinese contractors bring in 
their own labour force, equipment and food.

Election volunteers prepare for the ballot count, in which Mr Sata won 43 per cent of the vote

There were suggestions during the 
volatile campaign, which saw bloodshed and rioting between rival party 
supporters, that the Chinese were bankrolling Mr Banda. However Mr Sata 
edged to victory with 46 per cent of the vote.

Yesterday Mr Banda wept as he conceded defeat to the man who once served as one of his ministers.

He said Zambians must unite following the election.

'Zambia must not go backward,' he said. 'We must all face the future and go forward as one nation.'

Political commentators have raised 
concerns that Mr Sata's hostility towards China might have a negative 
impact on Zambia's economy.

The country's currency has already devalued in recent days in anticipation of a victory for Mr Sata.

Another cause for international 
concern has been the new president's support for Robert Mugabe's ruinous
 rule of Zimbabwe and decade-long land grab.

According to the United Nations, 70 
per cent of Zambia's 13million population live in poverty, and the 
average annual wage is £255.

Mr Sata's swearing-in makes Zambia 
one of the few countries in Africa to have had two democratic 
transitions of power since gaining independence from colonial powers in 
the 20th century.
