Louis van Gaal has made quite an impact in his first few weeks in English football. His strength of personality and confidence in himself are remarkable. During the World Cup, I happened to be staying in the same hotel as the Dutch national team in Rio de Janeiro and I had the opportunity to chat with him and to see at first hand the influence he had over his players and the team spirit he created.

And in the run-up to last weekend, everyone seemed to be of one mind: that he could prove an inspired choice as Manchester United manager. After last weekend’s defeat by Swansea, people are beginning to doubt him a little bit, not least his decision to switch to a back three, the system he played with Holland in the World Cup.

The performance seemed like a re-run of last season. A year ago I did say that I thought United would be struggling to make the top four, because of the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. But, from what I’ve seen so far, as long as United do make a couple of signings, I think this season will be different. I’ll stick my neck out and say Van Gaal will have them back in the top four again and qualifying for the Champions League; and that will probably be considered job done for the first season. 

Mr Motivator: Louis van Gaal will work his magic at Manchester United

They do need a midfielder who can orchestrate and change the play and another defender on top of Marcos Rojo, the Argentine they have signed from Sporting Lisbon. But with Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Adnan Januzaj, they look strong going forward.

He changed the system at half-time last weekend when it wasn’t working out and went to a back four and ultimately they ended up losing. But though he is sure to be flexible, and switch to a back four at times, my feeling is that the back three is a system that is back in fashion for good reasons. I’ve always been an advocate of its strengths, playing it with Swindon, Chelsea and England and now Harry Redknapp has introduced it at QPR, where I’m coaching.

I think the World Cup demonstrated that it is very much a system for the modern game. I don’t think there is any other system that is so flexible in allowing you to get into different shapes and formations so quickly. Costa Rica showed that in Brazil. I think that they won England’s group largely because of the system they played; they had options all over the pitch. Holland played it under Van Gaal and Mexico and Chile also used it well. Remember, Germany found it very difficult against Algeria when the African team used that system.

Threat: Manchester United look strong going forward with the likes of Robin van Persie

Talking tactics: Costa Rica used the 3-5-2 system to great effect at the World Cup in Brazil this summer 

Best player: Chelsea defender Dan Petrescu was a natural wing back

When I managed England I didn’t want to be outnumbered in midfield, which has traditionally been a problem with the national team. So when we had the ball, we were in the 3-5-2 shape, to give us that extra man in midfield. When we lost the ball, we would slide back into a four and protect ourselves; when in possession you slide into a wide back three.

It is a system that can help get you up the ladder, which is how Costa Rica used it. Or, with top-quality players, it can help you create so many problems for the opposition. I think most other formations can struggle against it, especially these days when there is a trend towards trying to get two forwards playing together again. In a 4-4-2 you get outnumbered. A lot of people are playing a diamond formation, but then you can lack width.

It allows you to be inventive with player positions, something Van Gaal has done a lot in his career. Don’t be surprised to see Michael Carrick playing in the middle of the centre-halves. When you get the ball there, you need to use it very well. I went back into that position with Swindon and at Chelsea Ruud Gullit played there for me. Steven Gerrard almost played it last year with Liverpool; if the centre halves got into trouble, he would go in behind them.

I know some have said that the system can place extraordinary strain on the wing-backs and Gary Neville mentioned earlier in the week that he felt that was the case sometimes when he was asked to play in that position. But I think it’s a fallacy that you need to be an extraordinary runner to play as a wing-back.

Dan Petrescu was the best I managed, because he knew which position he should be in when the ball was on the other side of the pitch. Sometimes wing-backs think it is hard work but they get caught out by getting too far forward. You don’t have to be right on the back post attacking and the next minute back on the back post defending.

You do it in phases, depending on where the ball is. If you’re using your physical prowess too much and not your mental prowess, then it can be tough. But once you’ve worked with players on the training pitch, you can put that right.

And that’s something at which Van Gaal has proved a master over the years. Give him time to work with the squad and both the players and the system might end up surprising people.

Rodgers can get the best out of Mario

Liverpool travel to Manchester City on Monday and though he won’t play, it’s likely that Mario Balotelli will be there as a Liverpool player, representing an extraordinary return to the Premier League. Clearly with

Balotelli, it’s not so much what he can do on the pitch — that obviously can be excellent — it’s what happens off it which would worry you.

Liverpool bound: Mario Balotelli is ready to make an extraordinary return to the Premier League

A lot of managers and coaches have fallen out with him. But I think Brendan Rodgers will see it as a challenge. He’s a very positive manager and has had experience of dealing with Luis Suarez’s issues. If he can get him firing on all cylinders and if he’s not getting sent off stupidly and rocking the boat, he will make a massive improvement to the team.

It puts Liverpool in the frame for the Champions League again, when most people would have said they might struggle to make the top four without Suarez. As such, it’s probably a risk worth taking.

Harry's offer was right for me

On Sunday I head back to White Hart Lane with my new club QPR. While Tottenham will always have a special place in my heart, I have been back with other clubs before and you put your professional hat on for the day. I have to make sure I do a good job for QPR.

Something special: Glenn Hoddle with Harry Redknapp on the training ground at QPR

With Harry Redknapp returning as well, we will have two former Tottenham managers on the bench. Harry’s call to me came out of the blue. I wasn’t looking to get back on the training ground as I have a number of business and media commitments. I have had other opportunities to come back and even had some preliminary talks with Crystal Palace this week. But this is the role which seemed to fit with what I wanted and my other interests.

Hopefully, I’ve got something to offer and Harry has been very positive. It’s great to work with Joe Jordan and Kevin Bond. The season will definitely be challenging but I’m confident we can do something special.
