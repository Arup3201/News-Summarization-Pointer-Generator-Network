Waste: Many people simply throw away their old computers when they upgrade instead of recycling

Facebook has challenged the next generation of science whizz-kids to help solve one of the technology world's biggest ecological problems - by designing a computer made from cardboard.

Rapid advances in modern technology mean every sleek new computer that hits the market is quickly usurped by a superior model, and servers are now typically replaced at least every four years.

The social media giant wants students to help combat the mountain of discarded hardware by building a biodegradable server that can be flung on to the compost heap.

Facebook set up its Open Compute project with the aim of designing affordable, eco-friendly servers, and now it has thrown down the gauntlet to students at Purdue University in the U.S. - a major research institution known for discoveries in technology and engineering - to come up with a design for a dissolvable server chassis.

It is necessary to replace servers regularly in order to maintain a fast and reliable service.

The housings are typically made from steel, which can be recycled, but the project aims to move toward an even more sustainable design made from entirely biodegradable materials, according to a report on businessinsider.com.

If the project is a success it could see the creation of a computer server that will eventually break down entirely and decompose after it is discarded.

Purdue students will spend time studying relevant research before splitting into teams to work on their proposals.

They will then present their ideas to judges and the winning team will receive funding and further support to build a prototype.

Open Compute said of the ambitious project: 'We think there's enormous potential here, as servers are sometimes replaced as often as every two to three years.

'And even though the steel in those server chassis is usually recycled, we think it's worth exploring designs that retain the needed resiliency but push the boundaries of sustainability.'

Earlier this year an Irish firm unveiled an environmentally-friendly PC made almost entirely from wood.

The makers of the iameco computer went to great lengths to ensure every possible part of the PC could be recycled.

Boasting a touch screen surrounded by a wooden frame, the team behind the award-winning model claim its carbon footprint is 70 per cent less than a conventional PC.
