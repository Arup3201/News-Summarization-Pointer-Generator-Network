A shark attack was probably never going to stop this teenage surfer from getting back in the water.

Rip Curl sponsored-surfer Kirra-Belle Olsson was bitten by a shark when she went for a morning surf at Avoca Beach on the NSW Central Coast in October last year.

The 13-year-old recalls ‘something was pulling my foot underwater’ but she ignored it, thinking it was just a friend trying to scare her.

But when she noticed a tail nearby, she quickly dashed back to shore and found gashes on her foot when she pulled her wetsuit up.

Surfer Kirra-Belle Olsson was bitten by a shark in October but she returned to the water just a month later

Her mates and a professional photographer were on the beach when the shark struck. Kirra was treated by bystanders and was rushed to Gosford Hospital.

Three months on, Kirra, from Copacabana on the Central Coast NSW told Daily Mail Australia she actually returned to the water just one month after the incident.

‘I kind of forgot about the shark attack,’ Kirra told Daily Mail Australia.

‘It didn’t put me off surfing. Not at all – I’ve put it behind me and pretty much carried on with my normal life.

‘My friends were very shocked and a bit worried when they heard the news but they knew I would be alright – they supported me through it.’

The teenage surfer suffered injuries to her lower calf muscle, as well as puncture wounds to her foot but she recovered in time to take out the under-18's girl’s Subway Summer Surf Series and under-14's Junior Surfing Title in Australia.

Surfing runs in the family for Kirra, who is the niece of pro surfer Matt Wilkinson. 

With the summer holiday on, she has been keeping herself busy at the beach with training ahead of the Surfer Armour competition at Avoca Beach, which will be held on Friday.

When she isn’t in the water, she says she’s just a ‘normal kid’ who goes to school.

‘I train around eight hours a day when I’m not at school but I’ve been able to juggle both – And I still have time to chill and hang with my friends,' she said. 

In October, the multiple state title-winning surfer was attacked by a shark when she went surfing on morning

Her proud father Jamie said he is relieved that his daughter is safe and doing what she loves most.

‘I’m very proud and it’s good to see the results and hard work she puts in,’ Mr Olsson told Daily Mail Australia.

‘She’s doing very well and I’m relieved that the attack didn’t put her off going in the water.

‘She’s tough and she doesn’t like getting second place but she’s definitely making a good name for herself in the surfing world.

‘We have a running joke in the family that started after the attack that I wished my two boys were as tough as her but yeah I can’t say so myself because I wish I was tough as her too.

‘She’s definitely my hero.’
