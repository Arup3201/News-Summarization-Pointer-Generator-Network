Homes and businesses could be built in national parks if developers pay to make up the damage elsewhere.

In a speech on boosting the rural economy, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson backed the idea of developments in some of England’s most picturesque areas.

In exchange construction firms would have to create new nature sites nearby to offset the damage caused.

The idea of increased development in England’s 10 National Parks including Exmoor, the Peak District, Dartmoor and the Lake District could be controversial.

But Mr Paterson argued that it could play a part in wider government plans designed to help boost growth and revive the rural economy.

He used a speech to the National Park Authorities Conference in Easingwold, York, to back the idea of ‘biodiversity offsetting’ in national parks.

Where a new development damages the natural environment, then a new nature site must be created to cancel out the damage.

He said: ‘For too long we have allowed
the lazy assumption that the environment and growth are incompatible 
objectives within the planning system.

‘I
believe that, with a bit of innovative thinking, in many cases it is 
possible to have both. This is why I am particularly interested in 
Biodiversity Offsetting. Offsetting gives us a chance to improve the way
our planning system works.

‘It gets round the long-running conundrum of how to grow the economy at the same time as improving the environment.

‘It
could provide real opportunities in our National Parks, where the 
necessary extension of a farm building could result in the enhancement 
of an existing habitat or the creation of a new one.’

Under
existing rules the National Park Authority has two statutory duties - 
to conserve the countryside and its wildlife, and to allow people to 
enjoy it.

A spokesman 
for the Campaign to Protect Rural England said: 'Exactly how would it be
possible for a developer to replace, for example, ancient hedgerows by 
way of mitigation?

'Some 
habitats, particularly sensitive ones, are irreplaceable and thoroughly 
integral to the landscape's character because it's taken centuries to 
evolve - you can't just order a new one to be delivered somewhere else 
like it's an Amazon purchase.

'Offsetting
doesn't address the complex way in which wildlife systems are sustained
and thrive, and if it allows developers to push through damaging 
schemes then it's just another way for money to win over protecting 
nature.'

The government has launched a consultation on biodiversity offsetting, which is still open, Mr Paterson said.

He stressed it was one of several policies which he thought could benefit national parks.

He added: 'There are many opportunities for National Parks to seize upon. One of these is the opportunity to capitalise on and increase the 110 million people who visit the UK’s National Parks every year.

'Tourism is important because it provides people with new experiences.  It enables people to appreciate and put a value on wildlife and wild places.

'Tourism also helps grow the economy.  Tourists spend money in our National Parks and this supports 68,000 jobs. 

'But also when tourists return home they are more likely to buy the products we export.  Great clothing, great food and great drink.'
