A frantic search is being carried out today after a boy was seen yelling for help as he was dragged into a van on Independence Day.

A police helicopter and door-to-door search is being carried out in Virginia after witnesses saw what they believed to be an abduction.

The child, who was wearing a red and white shirt and blue pants, was last seen riding his bicycle in Spotsylvania when a witness says he was dragged into a light blue van.

Search: FBI agents and Virginia police are trying to find a 12-year-old boy after reports of a kidnapping

Although no missing children have been reported police say they have credible evidence to believe it was a kidnapping. 

'We have a 24-hour emergency operation command center set up to deal strictly with this case,' Captain Jeff Pearce, of Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office, told ABC News.

The bicycle the child, who appeared to be about 12, was allegedly riding has been found by police, but they have not yet found the blue work van he was dragged into.

'A witness called 911 after
they saw a boy kicking and screaming for help and resisting a man who 
was trying to put him in a blue construction van,' Captain Pearce said.

'We
have several similar descriptions of that van as well as credible 
information to make us believe this is an abduction.'

The van had been seen in the neighborhood several times in the past week, according to NBC 12.

The alleged kidnapper is described as a white or Hispanic man who was wearing a white tank top and dirty pants.

Discovery: This bicycle was found abandoned near to where witnesses saw a child being dragged into a van

Extensive: Officers are carrying out a door-to-door search for the boy

Because no one has come forward to report a missing child, police have not yet launched an amber alert.

'Even if this is only a parental or 
custodial situation, whoever knows the boy needs to give us a call. Until 
they do, we are erring on the side of caution and treating it as an 
abduction,' Captain Pearce said. 

The FBI is helping state police with the search by sending agents and helicopters.
