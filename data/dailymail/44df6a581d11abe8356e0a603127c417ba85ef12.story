Olympic swimming star Rebecca Adlington has taken the plunge and gotten engaged to her boyfriend of two years.

The double Olympic champion declared herself to be the 'happiest person ever' after boyfriend and fellow swimmer, Harry Needs, popped the question.

Adlington, 24, who announced her retirement from competitive swimming last month, told her Twitter followers: 'Had the best weekend ever!!! Thank you @Harryneeds for making me the happiest person ever right now #engaged #isaidyes.'

Rebecca and fellow swimmer Harry Needs got engaged this weekend and announced it on Twitter

Rebecca Adlington and Harry needs in Disneyland Paris last year. Adlington wrote that she is the 'happiest person ever' after getting engaged

She added that she had been celebrating with friends after the proposal.

'Had an amazing day with some amazing people! #happy #lucky', she wrote.

Needs also took to Twitter to write: 'Popped the big question to the wifey @BeckAdlington & we're now #engaged #shesaidyes happiest man on earth.'

Referring to the Beyonce song, he added: 'If you like then you should put a ring on it'.

In an interview last August, Adlington insisted marriage was a long way off - citing the fact that Needs is younger than her.

She said at the time: 'He's only 20, bless him. If I ever mentioned marriage to him he'd be like, 'I'm only a baby'.'

Nation's sweetheart Rebecca Adlington won double bronze at last summer's Olympics and double gold in 2008 at the Beijing Games

She has previously said that their shared profession meant they have an increased level of understanding.

After announcing their relationship in 2011 she said: She said: 'He appreciates the focus I need and the sacrifices I have to make.

'Harry is just like me, really driven. We got to bed pretty early and rest at the weekends.'

Adlington, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, claimed two bronze medals at last summer's London Olympics, having won gold in the 400m and 800m in Beijing four years previously.

She has vowed to keep swimming until the age of 90.
