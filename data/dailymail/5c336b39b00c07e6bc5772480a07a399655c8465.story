A disgraced former New York City Police Commissioner is set to be freed from federal prison today after serving three years for tax fraud.

Bernard Kerik will host a banquet to celebrate his release and has ordered in some of his favourite foods for his return to his New Jersey home today.

Kerik was the first New York City Police Commissioner to ever be imprisoned on federal crimes, and has served three years after he pleaded guilty in 2009 to lying to White House officials and tax evasion.

Release: Former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik (right pictured at his trial in 2009) is expected to leave jail today after serving three years for tax fraud

His release is expected today at around 9am EST according to his friend Albert Manzo, who runs Brownstone catering in Paterson.

Quoted in an NBC New York article, Manzo said: 'He put a request in for some food that he's been missing for a few years...He loves our short ribs, shrimp scampi - a lot of things he doesn't have access to there.'

The caterer said Kerik had invited 20 guests to share his first meal at his Franklin Lakes home as a free man once again, having done time for his crimes.

The former NYC police boss, who stood beside former Mayor Rudy Giuliani at the time of the September 11, 2001, attacks, was once considered a star in law enforcement and national security.

But he saw his career begin to crumble when President George W. Bush nominated him in 2004 for U.S. Homeland Security secretary. Checks into his background led to disclosures about his failure to pay taxes for a nanny.

This undermined his consideration for the job and he withdrew from consideration. Further investigation, however, led to the criminal charges.

Former NYC Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, is now doing commercials after Kerik's tax fraud saga

In 2009, Kerik pleaded guilty to charges of tax evasion, lying on a bank loan application and lying to the federal government, including lying to White House officials about his association with anyone doing business with the city of New York.

He faced up to 30 years in prison on the most serious charge if he hadn't have pleaded guilty. He was sentenced in February 2010.

Kerik was good friends with NYC's former mayor Rudy Giuliani, but Kerik's fall from grace also clouded the professional fortunes of his friend. 

Giuliani, who had recommended Kerik - his former chauffeur and security guard - for the commissioner position, failed in his presidential bid in 2008. 

The 68-year-old's post-political career has now reached a low point as he is now starring in infomercials for personal security products, for LifeLock.
