Egypt’s judges have gone on strike in protest at the country’s president extending his authority. 

Judges of the supreme body in the judicial system, the Cassation Court, said yesterday that they would not return to work until President Mohamed Morsi rescinds his new powers, according to state TV. 

Earlier, the Supreme Constitutional Court had rejected charges from Morsi that it is working to bring down his government.

Last week, Muslim Brotherhood leader Morsi introduced what he claimed were temporary emergency measures. These included removing the possibility of any authority revoking his decisions. 

The high court of appeal is led by Mohammed Mumtaz Metwali, who also chairs the Supreme Judiciary Council, which oversees the nation's court system. Members of the council met Morsi on Monday to discuss his decrees.

A statement issued later by the presidential palace strongly suggested that the president's explanation of the decrees satisfied the council, but the panel has not publicly commented on the issue. 

A statement by the judges of the high appeals court, known as the Court of Cassation, described Morsi's decrees as an ‘unprecedented’ assault on the judiciary and its principles that ‘defies belief’. It said the decision to stop work at all its circuits was also unprecedented but justified by the ‘magnitude’ of the crisis.

Likely to stoke political turmoil: Protesters against Morsi clash with anti-riot security forces in Tahrir Square yesterday which have continued

The developments are likely to stoke the political turmoil triggered by Morsi’s power grab, as protests continue in Cairo against the president.

Earlier this week, some 200,000 demonstrators gathered in Tahrir Square, the site of the protests which toppled President Hosni Mubarak’s regime in 2011. 

Clashes between some protesters and police continued yesterday and organisers said that they could mobilise millions to keep the demonstrations going.

They plan another large rally in the capital tomorrow.

The liberal opposition has said it will not enter a dialogue with the president about the crisis until he rescinds his decrees.

A ruling, regardless of which way it goes, would constitute a direct challenge to Morsi, who took office in June as Egypt's first freely elected president but has enraged pro-democracy activists who claim he is acting too much like the authoritarian leader he replaced. 

The court also denounced Morsi's claim that it was part of a ‘conspiracy’ against him. 

‘The allegation that the (June) ruling was reached in complicity with others to bring down elected state institutions and consequently the state's collapse ... is incorrect and untrue,’ the constitutional court said in a statement read by its deputy chairman, Maher Sami, in a televised news conference. 

‘But what is most saddening for the court's judges came when the president of the republic joined, in a painful and cruel surprise, the continuing attacks against the constitutional court,’ it said, alluding to comments made by Morsi on Friday in which he said the June ruling was leaked ahead of its official announcement.
