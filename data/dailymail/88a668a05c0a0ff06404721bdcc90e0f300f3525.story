Gym-goers broke into a screaming match over whether or not a lawyer should be banned for working with the nurse who defied her Ebola quarantine.

Norman Siegel has been representing Kaci Hickox in a highly-publicized battle against the states of New Jersey and Maine, which ordered her into isolation after she returned, symptom-less, from west Africa.

Hickox has remained defiant, and sparked outrage when she went cycling and shook hands with members of the public.

Exposed? One gym-goer feared Normal Siegel has been exposed and could spread the disease by sweating

But it seems the panic has spread to Equinox Sports Club in Manhattan, where regulars fear her lawyer may have been exposed to the deadly virus and could 'sweat' on the work equipment.

A source told Page Six: 'An argument broke out when two regulars fought over whether Norman, who is a regular, should be allowed in.'

One is said to have shouted: 'They should ban Siegel! He's with that Ebola nurse' before warning: 'I'm going to tell the managers not to let Siegel in'.

The outburst was met with: 'You are a f***ing moron!'

The argument became heated, the source said, and almost came to physical blows.

Siegel told the paper: 'I love working out and playing basketball [at Equinox], so I hope they don't ban me. 

'This is based on the fear and misinformation on how the disease is transmitted that I have been dealing with all week. 

'If I knew who it was that said that, I'd want to sit down and have a coffee with him - or something stronger - and talk through this.'  

Out and about: Hickox was ordered to be quarantined until November 10 after treating patients in Sierra Leone

Handshake: She sparked outrage by shaking hands with people and going about day-to-day life in Maine

The dispute came after Hickox and Siegel appeared in court on Thursday to fight Maine's bid to impose restrictions  until the 21-day incubation period for Ebola ends on November 10. 

Hickox, who treated Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, contended confinement at her home in northern Maine violated her rights.

The judge thanked Hickox for her service in Africa and acknowledged the gravity of restricting someone's constitutional rights without solid science to back it up. 

'The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola,' he wrote.

'The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational.'

Hickox, 33, stepped into the media glare when she returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone to become subject to a mandatory quarantine in New Jersey.

Conflict: Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, was adamant the Hickox should be quarantined

After being released from a hospital there, she returned to this small town, where she was placed under what Maine authorities called a voluntary quarantine.

She said she is following the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of daily monitoring for fever and other signs of the disease.

'I'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it's not science-based,' she said earlier in the week.

In a court filing, the director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention backed away from the state's original request for an in-home quarantine and called for restrictions that fall in line with federal guidelines.

Hickox remains at risk of being infected with Ebola until the end of a 21-day incubation period, Dr Sheila Pinette.

'It is my opinion that the respondent should be subjected to an appropriate public health order for mandatory direct active monitoring and restrictions on movement as soon as possible and until the end of the incubation period ... to protect the public health and safety,' she wrote.
