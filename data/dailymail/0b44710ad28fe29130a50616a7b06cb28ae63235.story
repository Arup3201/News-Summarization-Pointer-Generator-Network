This is the scene at the heart of the Ebola crisis sweeping West Africa, which this week crossed the Atlantic and brought the first confirmed case to the United States.

The epicenter of the deadly virus is in impoverished Liberia, from which Thomas Duncan made his journey to Texas last month.

Dying patients are wheeled from the spots in the street where they fell to medical centers unable to cope with the constant tide of sufferers.

Stricken: A health worker sets down a woman thought to be suffering from Ebola outside a treatment center in Liberia

Barely coping: A patient waits on a mattress as a health worker approached with a thermometer - using a sheet of torn-up cardboard to carry the device, rather than his hands

Dying: The disease - which is almost always fatal - has affected thousands in West Africa. Above, health workers check on a patient who has been left suffering on a mattress in the treatment center

Overstretched: Government facilities in Liberia are struggling to cope with the ever-increasing number of patients

The latest figures from the World Health Organization show that the disease has now infected at least 7,423 people, with 3,355 confirmed deaths.

Because of the difficulties getting and organizing reliable data on the disease, the true figures are likely to be much higher, officials have admitted.  

Many patients are not counted because they never get medical help, perhaps hidden by fearful families or turned away by overwhelmed clinics. Some villages have turned into 'shadow zones' where villagers' resistance or the remote location makes investigating numerous deaths impossible.

Last week the U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimated there would be 8,000 cases reported in Liberia and Sierra Leone by September 30, but said the true figure would likely be 21,000 after correcting for under-reporting.

The outbreak has crippled already poor healthcare systems in countries such as Liberia, where Ebola patients are dying on the street and ambulances, medical staff, hospital beds and basic health kits are in short supply.

The World Health Organization updated its death toll on Friday to at least 3,439 out of 7,492 suspected, probable and confirmed cases.Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are the worst-hit nations.

There had been 739 deaths in Guinea and 623 deaths in Sierra Leone by the end of Oct. 1, and 2,069 deaths in Liberia by Sept. 30, the data showed.

There have also been eight deaths in Nigeria, the U.N. body said. Twenty cases have been recorded in Nigeria, one in Senegal and one in the United States.

Infected? The virus, transmitted through bodily fluids, has killed thousands in Africa - and health officials think death tolls may be much too low

Worry: A mother and her three children wait in the center to see whether any of them have contracted the deadly virus

It came as the UN pledged an extra five helicopters, as well as a new fleet of vehicles and motorbikes to move around patients and reach remote communities. 

'We have to as fast as we can because every day longer that it takes, more people die and that is not acceptable,' said Antony Banbury, the American diplomat who heads the United Nations Mission on Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).

He said: 'Nobody should be under the illusion that it will be easy. Thousands have died and more will die tomorrow.'

Warning: A man passes a mural set up to warn people about the disease in Monrovia

The WHO has declared the Ebola epidemic an international public health emergency, and governments from the United States to China, Cuba and Britain have sent troops and medics to help contain the disease.

As part of the U.S. effort to help contain the spread of Ebola, the Pentagon said on Friday the number of military personnel that could be deployed to West Africa could reach nearly 4,000, more than earlier estimates of about 3,000.

British charity, Save the Children, said on Thursday that five people in Sierra Leone were contracting Ebola every hour and warned that could double by November if urgent actions were not taken.
