Jorge Mendes, as agents do, backs his client.

Forget Manchester United, he tells us, Radamel Falcao can walk into any team.

Not on recent evidence he can't.

Both Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie failed to impress in Manchester United's clash with Burnley

The Colombian forward (left) was eventually substituted for James Wilson, who was more effective

Against 19th-placed Burnley the Colombian combined with Robin van Persie in the most one-paced attack since the England cricket team last toured Down Under.

For weeks United fans had bemoaned Louis van Gaal's decision to play untested youngster James Wilson ahead of the man they paid £6million for just to get on loan.

Now we know that there was method in the apparent madness.

Burnley's centre-half partnership of Jason Shackell and Michael Keane are not among the Premier League's finest or fastest.

For long periods, however, they were untroubled by a strikeforce worth a reported £70m.

Their team appeared to be wearing kits made of Bacofoil and throughout the first half Falcao did his best Tin Man impression with the ball cannoning off him on more than one occasion.

Falcao has only scored four goals in 18 appearances for United since joining on loan 

United captain Wayne Rooney offers a word of advice to Falcao during the Burnley match 

It was ugly to see.

Yes, his flick back set up Chris Smalling to save United from half-time pelters from their own fans.

But the man is here to score goals and he is not doing that.

The record says it all: 13 starts, five substitute appearances and four goals.

Perhaps it is still too early to judge. This is, remember, a man who has come back from serious injury before.

But it would appear that the anterior cruciate ligament damage he sustained in January last year may have done more than keep him out of the World Cup.

When Falcao was mercy substituted on 74 minutes against Burnley he received applause you would describe as polite rather than rapturous from the home support.

Wilson impressed against an, admittedly tired, Burnley defence when he came on as a substitute

Falcao has been preferred up front to Rooney, who spent parts of the game playing as a holding midfielder 

The contingent of travelling Lancastrians were not so kind, gleefully belting out 'What a waste of money'.

On came Wilson who, along with Di Maria, immediately had an admittedly tiring defence back-pedalling.

The youngster may not have Falcao's pedigree but as Van Gaal has already said, whether a player costs £95m or £5,000 it makes no difference to him.

Mendes now appears to have gone nuclear, stating that Falcao would not be struggling if Sir Alex Ferguson had been in charge.

That sounds very much like a comment from a man who has just asked United about the chances of them taking up that £43.5m option to make his deal a permanent one.
