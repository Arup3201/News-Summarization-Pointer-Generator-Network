Thailand officials are set to release a  two-minute animated video in Chinese to discourage tourists from taking their clothes off in inappropriate places when on holiday.

The move follows a public outcry after an image of a woman going topless in the common area of the toilets at at Don Mueang international airport in Bangkok while getting changed went viral.

Although the nation has a reputation for vibrant red light areas, public nudity is strictly forbidden in Thailand and even taking one's clothes off in the relative privacy of the ladies is apparently considered by locals to be offensive.

The woman in the picture is said to have been Chinese, although this cannot be verified, and while the incident raises barely an eyebrow with many - when shared on English speaking sites the woman who took the photo was vilified more than the woman changing - the Thai government felt moved to act. 

Another woman in the toilets took the above image and posted it to the Facebook page of CSI LA with the comment: 'Chinese tourists are terrible! I saw a group of Chinese tourists stripping in the ladies' room. Some were topless, some bottomless. So disgraceful!'

The image, which has since been shared widely on social media platforms, shows only one woman and her reflection in the mirror - it has since been removed from the site. 

A spokesperson for Don Mueang airport confirmed the incident took place there but was keen to not blow the incident out of proportion.

'In general, Chinese tourists in Thailand are well-behaved and have brought substantial revenue to the country. If we see something inappropriate, we'll issue a warning or impose a penalty on a case-by-case basis,' the airport stated.

The Ministry of Tourism and Sports is going a step further with a video telling tourists how to behave in their country, and instructing them to keep their clothes on, set to appease public outrage.

The video will be posted on travel blogs and tourism websites as soon as this week in a move they hope will go some way to ending some Thai locals' animosity towards Chinese visitors.  

Anek Srichiwachat, head of the Thai Travel Agents Association (TTAA), asked Thai people not to share the photo any further due to the risk of offending the Chinese.

'The Chinese government has made a campaign telling its citizens how to behave when travelling abroad. The campaign might reach only the big cities.

'As the host, we should just nicely warn them. We should not berate them by sharing the photo,' Mr Anek said

Public nudity in Thailand is illegal and it's considered disrespectful to locals - mostly Buddhist or Islamic - to go topless in public. 

However, there are a number of naturist resorts in the country such as Chan Resort in Pattaya where guests must agree to abide by international naturist rules of etiquette.
