A former Apple CEO has warned the company needs to launch cheaper products or risk missing opportunities in emerging markets.

John Sculley, who was boss of the tech giant from 1983 to 1993, said the firm could lose out to its competitors if it fails to launch more affordable products.

His warnings followed predictions he made last month that Apple is 'a few years' away from another 'creative leap' like the iPad.

John Sculley saw Apple sales increase tenfold when he worked as CEO between 1983 and 1993

Mr Sculley, who oversaw the firing of Steve Jobs, said: 'Apple is now being challenged by the
combination of Samsung and Google... Apple makes really good products, and Samsung makes really 
good products.

He told the Huffington Post: 'It’s really a two-horse race. Where I think Apple is 
exposed: the price points of Apple’s products are just so high by 
comparison with Samsung’s.

'My sense is that there’s a big opportunity 
that Apple is either going to miss if it doesn’t bring out lower-priced 
products for emerging markets, or that it can end up getting and 
becoming huge success story if does.'

In developing markets Apple has failed to dominate the tech industry as it has in the western world.

John Sculley said Apple is not to blame for a lull in innovation, but that they need to wait for the next big wave in creativity

In India the company has around a five percent market share, compared to 40 percent for Samsung - which offers vast product variety at a range of prices.

In Indonesia smartphones cost around $120 while an Apple equivalent sets consumers back $800.

Mr Sculley, who is now a venture capitalist, confessed to owning an iPhone and an iPad as well as a Galaxy Note.

He added he thought the 'lull' at Apple was due to the current state of technology.

'You can only surf the big wave when there are big waves, and there are moments when technology is poised for innovators to come in and do something spectacular, and then there are other moments when you just have to play out an opportunity and wait for next big wave to come along.'
