A paedophile firearms officer raped an eight-year-old girl and carried out violent attacks on a series of former girlfriends.

Jonathan White, 41, who worked for South Yorkshire Police,was a firearms support officer who helped provide round-the-clock armed cover.

But the officer carried out sex attacks on a young girl over a two-year period when she was aged between eight and 10.

Jailed: Jonathan White, 41, was given 12 years behind bars at Nottingham Crown Court

He was jailed for 12 years after a jury at Nottingham Crown Court found him guilty of two counts of rape, two charges of sexual assault and two allegations of inciting sexual activity with the young victim.

He was also put on the sex offenders' register for life and banned from working with children.

The latest convictions add to his earlier shameful and cowardly attacks on women.

He resigned from South Yorkshire Police in November 2009 after eight years with the force when he was convicted of attacking a former girlfriend.

He was later jailed in 2010 for assaulting another partner.

Other former girlfriends have reported that, while he was a 'smooth charmer' at the start of their relationships, he would then turn violent.

One ex-partner, who planned to marry White before his arrest over child sex abuse claims, said he told her he had gone to Afghanistan to work as a private security contractor - when in fact he was in jail for domestic violence.

'He was incredibly manipulative,' she said.

Police also investigated claims White sexually abused a six-year-old girl but the case did not go to court due to concerns about putting the youngster through the ordeal when officers already had a strong case against White.

The 16-year-old victim's grandmother said: 'It is incredible to think this was an officer who had the right to carry a gun.'

Detective Constable Lisa Saporita, of Nottinghamshire's child abuse investigation unit, said: 'White's victim has shown incredible strength and bravery.'
