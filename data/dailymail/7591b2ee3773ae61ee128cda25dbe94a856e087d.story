Brendan Rodgers insists Mario Balotelli can still forge a career with Liverpool – and believes he is ready for the fight.

The Italy striker has not started a game for Liverpool since November 8, when they lost 2-1 to Chelsea at Anfield, and there is a doubt about whether he will even be in the squad for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge.

Rodgers spoke with Balotelli at Melwood last week about how he expects him to play and the demands that he places on his forwards, emphasising they have to press and be intense in their work – qualities which the 24-year-old has yet to show.

A cloud has hung over Balotelli’s future at Anfield for many months but Rodgers is not yet ready to call time on his chances of making a contribution and does not see the imminent return of Daniel Sturridge as a barrier to his prospects.

‘We will give Mario every chance,’ said Rodgers. ‘We brought him here to show consistently he can play at the top level. It has been a difficult period but he is a good boy who wants to fight for his place. Players have been out of the fold but shown they can get back in and stay in.

‘It doesn’t matter whether Daniel Sturridge is coming back. It improves our squad. They played well together at Tottenham. We will see how Daniel is today [Monday]. He trained very well with the team yesterday and it is as confident as he has looked.

‘We won’t risk him, that is for sure. We need to make sure he is ready and feels ready. He won’t be 100 per cent when he comes back. He will need game time, but all we can do is make sure he is in the best condition he can be physically and mentally.’

Rodgers, meanwhile, has urged his squad to exploit any lingering hangover Chelsea are suffering from the way they capitulated against Bradford; Liverpool’s manager recognises the threat of Jose Mourinho’s side and is respectful of them but, equally, he feels his own troops have nothing to lose.

Liverpool finished the first leg in the ascendance last Tuesday and Rodgers feels they played well enough to have won comfortably. He now wants his players to replicate that effort and secure the club’s first trip to Wembley since 2012.

‘The result at the weekend does not help,’ said Rodgers. ‘They will have great motivation and after a game like that you want to put it right, but there is also in the back of your mind even if you are 2-0 up you can lose so there can be trepidation.

‘It is a different game at Stamford Bridge but we were a real threat going forward and good defensively. We controlled the counter-attack really well and looked a threat going forward. I thought we took that into Bolton but could not get the goal.

‘The team is on the up and confidence is really high. We have great confidence. It is very important and we will do everything we can to get there. Winning a trophy is a priority and it is a one-off game to get us there.’
