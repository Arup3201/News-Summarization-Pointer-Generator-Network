Two-year-old Christy, who was strangled to death by his mother Melanie Ruddell

A mother heard voices in her head and hallucinated just before she strangled her toddler and carried his body to a police station, an inquest heard.

Melanie Ruddell spoke for the first time about the death of her two-year-old son Christy via video link from a secure unit where she is being treated for a mental illness.

The 40-year-old, of Castle Eden, near Hartlepool, killed her son at her brother’s home in West Rainton, near Durham, before driving his body to Peterlee police station in August 2010.

She was later detained under the Mental Health Act after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Speaking publicly for the first time about the horrific incident - from a secure unit in Teesside - a tearful Ms Ruddell said: 'I felt anxious and I was frightened for Christy.

'I was confused, very confused. I heard voices and screaming. I couldn’t connect anything with reality.

'I was frightened of friends and family.

'I was scared to a point where it felt as though I was hanging off a cliff. I was exhausted.'

The inquest, held at Sunderland Civic Centre, heard Mrs Ruddell’s mental state worsened after the breakdown of her marriage to husband Alan.

She told the hearing she had been a ‘happy mam’ at home with Christy and loved him, but felt anxious and frightened for him.

After friends and family grew concerned, she went to the A&E department at the University Hospital of Hartlepool for treatment.

But after being seen by a doctor, she discharged herself from the unit before a psychiatric assessment as she was in a rush to be reunited with her son, who was with her brother at his home in West Rainton.

She said: 'The doctor said he would like me to see the team of people at the hospital.

'I said "I’ve got to get back to Christy". I just couldn’t think properly.'

She spoke about her return to her brother’s home and said: 'I wanted the police to come and protect us. It was two o’clock in the morning. I thought "That’s it, we are going to be separated for ever and ever".

'Everything was hopeless.'

Her friend, Carol-Ann Beeston, also gave evidence at the hearing about how she tried in vain to keep Ms Ruddell at the hospital, knowing she needed professional help.

'She was so deranged at this point,' said Ms Beeston. 'She was talking a load of gobbledygook.'

Ms Beeston added: 'She was a really good mother, but that weekend she was very agitated.

'It was as if someone else was in her body. I had never seen her like this.

'She was frightened she might harm herself. I didn’t think she would harm Christy.

'I actually begged them to keep her in. I knew she should be in hospital, not to be going home.

'She wanted to discharge herself. There was nothing they could do.'

Mrs Beeston said hospital staff told her there was nowhere to admit her to, so she decided to leave.

Pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton said Christy’s death was caused by strangulation with a dressing gown cord.

He said there was also a stab wound to the chest, which was up to 40mm deep, but it had not passed through any vital organs.

Sunderland coroner Derek Winter yesterday formally re-opened the inquest into Christy’s death.

The hearing, which is being attended by many friends and family of the youngster, is expected to last two weeks.

Mrs Ruddell has been receiving treatment for her illness since Mr Justice McCombe sentenced her to an indefinite hospital order at Newcastle Crown Court in February last year.
