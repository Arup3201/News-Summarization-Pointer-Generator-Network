Parents have been urged to make sure their children have been vaccinated against measles following a second outbreak, this time in the North of England.

Doctors have reported 200 cases of the disease in and around Middlesbrough in the past six months, with an additional 19 last week.

As a result, health officials in the North East have joined colleagues in South Wales calling on parents to make sure their children are vaccinated if they didn’t have the MMR jab as babies.

More than 1,000 people - mainly children - queued up at drop-in clinics in and around Swansea on Saturday to have the MMR jab after GPs reported 20 new measles cases daily.

The Health Protection Agency publishes measles figures for England on a quarterly basis except where there is a local outbreak, and currently only the North East is being broken down in this way.

Last week Public Health England (PHE) - which now oversees the HPA - said 200 cases of measles had been confirmed in the region since last September, along with 176 suspected cases.

That was an increase of 19 confirmed and 14 suspected cases on the previous week.

The majority of cases were in the Teesside, County Durham and Darlington areas.

The figure of 200 cases in six months compares with 11 cases in all of 2010, 18 in 2011 and 41 in 2012.

Julia Waller, immunisation lead for the North East PHE Centre said: ‘Measles is highly infectious and unvaccinated children and adults who haven’t had it before are at risk when it is circulating, as it is now in this region.

‘There is no treatment for measles but it can be prevented by the MMR vaccine and two doses are required to ensure the best protection.

‘If anyone is unsure about their immunisation status they should check with their GP. If you’ve missed out on MMR in the past it’s always possible to catch-up as the vaccine can be given at any age.’

Doctors in Swansea warned last week that as many as 3,800 children there had missed out on having the MMR jab.

More drop-in clinics will be held next weekend while an immunisation campaign is due to be held in schools after the Easter break.
