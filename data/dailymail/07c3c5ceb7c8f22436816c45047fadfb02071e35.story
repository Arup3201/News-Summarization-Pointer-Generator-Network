Crippling defence cuts have left the UK without a single warship dedicated to protecting the waters around the British Isles.

For the last month the stretched Royal Navy has been unable to deploy a frigate or destroyer whose sole task is to patrol the country’s coastline.

Typically, the Navy would place a vessel - known as the Fleet Ready Escort (FRE) - on standby to respond swiftly to a potential threat such as a terrorist attack in UK waters or abroad.

But controversial cuts to the beleaguered fleet and the Libyan conflict meant naval chiefs were forced to axe the emergency capability at the start of October.

Worrying: Cutbacks have left the UK without a single warship tasked with protecting the coastline - the last ship to undertake this role was the Type 23 frigate HMS Portland

It has raised serious concerns that Britain’s defences are at risk because of the gap in firepower.

Admiral Lord Alan West, the former 
First Sea Lord, said: ‘If there was a terrorism incident in UK waters, 
this would historically be the ship sent in to deal with it.

‘It’s a big problem. If we haven’t 
got a ship ready to do this role then it’s worrying. It’s a very 
unsatisfactory position to be in.

‘What it shows is that the number of 
frigates and destroyers we’ve got now is insufficient. We need more 
ships as a matter of urgency.’

In last year’s Strategic Defence and 
Security Review (SDSR) the Government cut the number of frigates or 
destroyers in the Navy’s surface fleet from 24 to 19.

Critics warned the cuts would leave 
the navy overstretched. Since March nine warships have been deployed to 
Libya to join operations to topple Colonel Gaddafi.

But the war dragging on has left none left to be on hand in the UK.

Concerned: Former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord Alan West, says it is worrying if a ship is not available to protect the country's shores

It is understood the last time the 
Navy did not protect ‘home waters’ was in 1982 after every available 
ship left for the Falklands War.

The last ship to undertake the high readiness role was the Type 23 frigate HMS Portland.

However, it left the position on 
October 3 to take part in the Joint Warrior Nato exercise off Scotland 
which provides vital training for ships’ crews.

Major General Julian Thompson, former
commanding officer of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines and a Falklands 
veteran, said: ‘This demonstrates how sea-blind the government has 
become - they don’t seem to realise we live on an island.

‘The first duty of the Royal Navy is 
to defend the British Isles and yet it hasn’t got enough ships to do so.
It is absolutely appalling.

‘Some people might say, "Well, we’re 
not under attack." Well, okay. But if we stay unprotected too often for 
too long someone might decide to run some guns, or smuggle drugs or ship
over a few terrorists. It really makes your jaw drop.’

The Ministry of Defence said the next FRE vessel would be formally notified by the end of the week.

But with the MoD being forced to make
cuts of £4.7billion by 2015, as well as eliminate an equipment 
overspend of £38billion, there are fears that the high-alert ship will 
be ditched more frequently in future.

Earlier this year the head of the 
Navy was hauled over the coals by Prime Minister David Cameron for 
warning that the UK’s defences would be at risk if the war in Libya 
dragged on beyond September - a stance that has proved correct.

Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the First 
Sea Lord, said warships patrolling ‘home waters’ around the British 
Isles may have to be diverted to the Mediterranean to shore up Britain’s
war effort.

At the peak of the conflict, Britain 
had five warships - destroyer HMS Liverpool, mine clearance vessel HMS 
Bangor, a Trafalgar-class submarine, helicopter carrier HMS Ocean and 
supply vessel Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort Rosalie - off the Libyan coast.

Sir Mark said that beyond September 
‘we might have to request the Government to make some challenging 
decisions about what priorities they want. The Government will have a 
choice as to where they chose to take the platform from - it could be 
from around home waters.’

The MoD said that as well as the high
readiness ship, the Navy normally has a frigate escorting the Trident 
nuclear deterrent and others protecting fishing vessels.

A spokesman said: ‘Due to the 
successful deployment of Royal Naval units to the Libya campaign it has 
been necessary to re-profile the tasks of some ships.

‘UK waters remain well protected as 
at any one time there are always a number of Royal Navy ships conducting
security operations. Should a ship be required for a counter-terrorist 
operation, for example, a Royal Navy ship would be allocated 
immediately.’

Asked why there has not been a FRE 
since HMS Portland, an MoD spokesman said: ‘We do not need one 
currently. We’ve got ships off Libya and they are returning now. That’s 
the situation. We’ve had to look after our priorities and be flexible. 
We are doing the best with what we have got.’

The Government has been warned that service personnel are 'hurting' because of redundancies and cuts as further details of a scheme to boost support for the armed forces were revealed.

Defence Minister Andrew Robathan announced that more than £423,000 had been allocated to 13 bids in England for local projects funded through the community covenant scheme.

The projects range from money for a play area to a grant for English lessons for Gurkhas and funding for Royal Wootton Bassett to help commemorate the town's new Royal status.

The £30 million grant scheme was launched earlier this year and aims to reinforce the military covenant spelling out the bond between the nation and the armed forces.

But Dawn McCafferty, chairman of the RAF Families Federation, warned of the impact of redundancies and cuts to allowances on service personnel.

She told a Local Government Association (LGA) conference in London discussing the covenant that many were 'keeping their heads down' in an attempt to avoid the next rounds of job cuts.

'Families are hurting and actually the covenant doesn't mean a great deal to those who have just received a redundancy notice,' she said.

Roger Harrison, from St Neots, Cambridgeshire, criticised the Government over cuts to allowances.

The former warrant officer in the Adjutant General's Corps, who is a Huntingdonshire councillor, accused the Government of paying for a doubling of the operational allowance in Afghanistan through cuts to education and disruption allowances.

'I find it very disappointing that the minister wants to take all the credit for the doubling of the operational allowance when they have cut other allowances to pay for it,' he said.

He told Mr Robathan: 'If you want local councils to sign up for this scheme, central Government should put its money where its mouth is.'

Mr Robathan said the armed forces deserved to be properly remunerated.

'We have to balance the absolutely correct payment of continuity of education allowance to people who need it with the needs of the public purse,' he said.

'That is also true of other allowances, that we have to ensure that we are not overly-generous at a time when actually outside the armed forces people are in a pretty difficult situation.'
