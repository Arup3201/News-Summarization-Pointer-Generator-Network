An American luger had the likes of Beyonce cheering her on today as she placed in the top 10 at the Sochi Olympics.

Kate Hansen, a student at Brigham Young University, grabbed the star's attention after making headlines with her unique warm-up ritual.

Before every race, the 21-year-old puts on her headphones and dances out to a 'strictly Beyonce' playlist.

Crazy in LUGE: American luger Kate Hansen warms up for each race by dancing to Beyonce

Secret ritual: She says her 'strictly Beyonce' playlist helps her get fierce and stoked for competition

Winner: Hansen placed 10th in Tuesday's luge race

When the star read Hansen's story on SBNation, she reposted it on her Facebook page and wrote: 'Go Kate!'

And the good vibes seemed to have paid off. While Hansen didn't medal in the competition, she did place a respectable 10th in the race. Teammate Erin Hamlin won the bronze medal.

Before the competition Tuesday, Hansen spoke with NBC about the entertaining warm-up routine.

Hansen said her girl Bey 'gets me fierce and I get stoked'.

And she doesn't care what other people think of the ritual.

'I'm completely in my own world and it doesn't matter who's staring, I'm still going to dance.'

While most find the dancing endearing, one NBC commentator wasn't impressed.

Former luger Duncan Kennedy said he'd like to see a more 'sport-specific' warm-up from Hansen.

'What you see out of the top runners, the really-heavy-hitters, is they're working the arms and the shoulders and getting the power out of them because the start has to be a powerful explosive movement.

'While that may be a very good general warm-up, I'm not sure it gets the job done.'

But words can't bring Hansen down. After the race, the California native beamed with four smooth runs- clocking 50.793 on the first run and 50.499 on the fourth run.

'It was so fun,' Hansen said. 'It was probably the most fun I've had sliding in a long time.'

'I didn't make a fool out of myself, so I'm just stoked to be here.'
