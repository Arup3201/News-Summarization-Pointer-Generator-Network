Send off: Astronomer Sir Patrick Moore wanted the world's leaders on a rocket into spa

Visitors to a new science exhibition will hear the late Sky At Night host Sir Patrick Moore say how he wanted to get rid of the world’s leaders by sending them to a distant star.

He recorded the message nine months before his death last December and describes his hopes for the world in 2113.

Sir Patrick, who was 89 when he died, says: ‘It depends entirely... not on science but  on the politicians.

‘I must say that looking at the present world leaders inspires me with a feeling of no confidence at all.

'I’d like to take the whole lot of them on a spacecraft and send them on a one-way journey to Alpha Centauri.’

Alpha Centauri is a constellation of stars in the southern sky which would take at least 40 years to reach by rocket from Earth.

His voice features in a room devoted to recordings of famous Britons at the exhibition to mark the 100th birthday the Medical Research Council at Imperial College in London’s Kensington.

Other contributors to the Medical Research Council exhibition include outgoing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King who hopes the world’s banking crises will become less severe and less frequent in future.

He also predicts that in 100 years’ time money, as we know it, will not exist.

‘I think the form of money may well look very different,’ says King. ‘It may be entirely electronic.’

Scientist and TV presenter Lord Winston, Channel Four News host Jon Snow, trade union leader Bob Crow and ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ judge Bruno Tonioli, also give their opinions on the future.

Mr Tonioli jokingly introduces himself: 
‘Hello I am Bruno Tonioli. I am part of the fabric of society now, 
introductions are not necessary.’

The exhibition, called Strictly Science, runs from April 4-14 at Imperial College, South Kensington.

Sir Patrick had said in previous interviews that he wanted the world’s leaders rocketed off into space.

Ship'em off: The late Sky At Night host recorded a message before his death saying he
hoped to send world leaders, presumably British Prime Minister Cameron 
and U.S. President Barack Obama, into space

Far enough: Sir Patrick Moore suggested Alpha Centauri as a suitable destination for world leaders - a star constellation which would take 40 years to reach

Despite his uncompromising views, Sir Patrick himself dabbled in politics. In the general election of 1979 he helped launch the United Country Party, complaining that the Conservatives were ‘too wet’. A staunch eurosceptic, he later joined UKIP and reserved his strongest criticism for Labour MPs.

Musing in one edition of The Sky At Night on the probability of alien life in space, he said: ‘Somewhere in the universe there could be a complete carbon copy of Anthony Wedgwood Benn -- although I sincerely hope not.’ 

Launched in April 1957, the programme attracted millions of viewers and made a huge contribution to educating the British public about astronomy.

Sir Patrick entered the record books as the longest-running host of the same television show ever.
