At least five people were killed when a plane carrying 45 passengers and crew crash-landed in fog in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk late on Wednesday, officials said.

The plane overshot the runway at Donetsk Airport as it attempted to execute an emergency landing and broke up, the emergencies ministry, quoted by Interfax news agency, said.

Interfax also quotes surviving passenger
Dmitry Verbitsky as saying that the plane had caught fire during the 
crash-landing, but it was quickly put out.

The Soviet-designed twin-engined Antonov
24 turboprop had flown to Donetsk, which was shrouded in thick fog, 
from the Black Sea coastal city of Odessa.

Andriy Shyshatsky, head of Donetsk's regional administration, said five people were confirmed dead, while the fate of two others was not yet clear.

'The large majority of passengers have been saved,' Shyshatsky told journalists.

'At the moment, there are four dead. One person is visible in the wreckage, but we don't yet know whether he is alive or not.

Investigators, firefighters and Emergencies Ministry members work near the damaged aeroplane. Many passengers had been flying in for the Champions League clash between Shakthar Donetsk and Germany's Borussia Dortmund

'We are searching for one other person,'

Emergency Situations Ministry spokeswoman Inna Sedova said the plane was operated by the small Yuzhne Avialinii (Southern Airlines) company, which runs domestic flights out of Odessa.

A total of 12 people were injured.

It was not immediately clear what caused the accident. Rescuers and investigators are working at the scene.

The plane that crashed was an Antonov An-24 plane, similar to the one in this 2005 file photo. Four people have been confirmed dead but two more have not been accounted for

It is believed the crew evacuated the plane at least partially before it caught fire.

A local police source told the AFP news agency that the aircraft came to rest about 700m (2,300ft) from the runway.

Shishatsky spokeswoman Rimma Fil told 
the AP that most of the passengers were likely heading for the Wednesday
night Champions League football match between Ukraine's Shakhtar and 
Borussia Dortmund.

The match opened with a minute of silence in memory 
of the dead.

In recent years, former Soviet republics have had some of the world's worst air traffic safety records. Experts blame the poor safety record on the age of the aircraft, weak government controls, poor pilot training and a cost-cutting mentality.
