The Clippers have tried at least once before to remove Donald Sterling as owner over taped comments he made, it emerged today.

A special committee of six NBA owners unanimously recommended Sterling's removal from the franchise in September 1982.

It followed criticism over comments he made to a luncheon earlier that year insisting the Clippers needed to finish last so they could draft a player like Ralph Sampson.

The committee had grown concerned about 
late payments by the Clippers to players, hotels, program printers and 
others.

And previously, the NBA had sued Sterling to block his proposal to move the team from San Diego to Los Angeles.

But much of the controversy revolved around the taped speech he made, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Sterling said at the time that the 
remarks were misunderstood. The NBA, however, fined him $10,000 and, 
when the committee met, it listened to recordings of the luncheon.

But an NBA source told the newspaper 32 years ago: 'He's as good as gone.'

The next step was for the league's advisory and finance committee to consider terminating Sterling's ownership.

But
 eight days after the committee's vote in 1982 Sterling announced his 
desire to sell the team. That bought time and the league's effort to 
remove Sterling eventually lost steam.

Fast forward three decades and NBA owners seem as committed as Commissioner Adam Silver to ending Sterling's ownership of the Clippers.

The
 league's advisory/finance committee held its first meeting about 
Sterling on Thursday, two days after Silver said he would urge owners to
 force a sale of the team.

The
 10-member committee held a conference call to discuss 'the process for 
termination of Donald T. Sterling's ownership of the Los Angeles 
Clippers,' NBA executive vice president Mike Bass said in a statement.

The next step was for the league's advisory and finance committee to consider terminating Sterling's ownership. 'The committee unanimously agreed to move forward as expeditiously as possible and will reconvene next week.'

Silver banned Sterling for life and fined him $2.5 million Tuesday for making racist comments. Sterling can have no association with the league or the team, but Silver wants more.

A forced sale would require approval by three-fourths of the league's 30 owners. Silver said he was confident he would get the votes.
