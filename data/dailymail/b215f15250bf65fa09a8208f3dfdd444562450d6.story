A freak gust of wind turned a family fireplace into a giant vacuum which a pet rabbit up into the chimney breast where it was stuck for three days.

Nine-year-old Natasha Cameron was in tears when her best friend Chloe, a sand-coloured rabbit, was blown up into the chimney by a rush of air at her home in Bramhall, Manchester, on Sunday.

The family hoped the animal would hop back down but by Wednesday they decided to call for extra help.

Firefighters and RSPCA officials desperately tried to coax the floppy eared pet down before she was eventually eased to safety using a pipe and a chopped up piece of washing line.

Chloe was given treatment to clean her eyes and Natasha was delighted to have her beloved pet back in her hands.

Natasha said: 'She's a really mischievous rabbit.

'I was devastated when it happened and I couldn't stop crying because I thought she might be dead.

'She was very thin and dirty and her eyes were really red when she came down but she's alright now.'

Natasha's mother, Pru, 37, revealed Chloe had been bought as a Christmas present and that her daughter was petrified when she found out her rabbit was trapped in the chimney.

Pru said: 'She was stuck up in the fireplace for three days and it just seemed like she had been sucked up by a hoover.

'I've never seen anything like it and we couldn't sleep for three nights while she was stuck in there.'

Pru, Natasha and her brothers Alexander, 11, and Harry, six, had only moved into the home a week earlier when disaster struck.

Firefighters used a specialist 'snake eye' camera to find Chloe, which had been let out of her hutch for a spot of exercise.

RSPCA Inspector Steve Wickham said: 'I have never come across a case like this before.

'There
 were bricks sticking out in the inside of the chimney so it was like a 
ladder and that was probably how Chloe managed to climb up.

'We created a makeshift catcher and managed to hook her down with the help of a camera.

'We were worried at first that we would have to remove the chimney but thankfully we managed to avoid that.

'She had lost quite a bit of weight and had soot in her eyes but thankfully she was fine.'
