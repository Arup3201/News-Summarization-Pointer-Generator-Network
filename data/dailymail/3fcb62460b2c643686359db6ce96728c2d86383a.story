From sleepless nights to mountains of equipment, parents have a lot to contend with when they bring a new baby home.

But now a car seat has launched that transforms into a buggy so parents have one less piece of kit to carry – or at least in the boot of their car.

The Doona has legs and wheels that fold up beneath it in a single motion, converting the stroller into a car seat.

Easy does it: A clever car seat that transforms into a buggie (pictured) has been designed so that parents have one less piece of kit to store - at least in the boot of their car

USP: The Buggie folds up in a single motion from a stroller to a car seat. Folding it back into a chair is a four-step process.

Size: The push chair has a height of 39inches (99cm) but is as small as 23inches (60cm) tall and 17inches (44cm) wide when it is folded up. It is designed to free up boot space in cars

Weight: 15lbs (7kg)

Colours: Seven, including a bright pink and sky blue

Price: £299

It weighs 15lbs (7kg) and can be used as a seat in cars and aeroplanes, while two simple manoeuvres convert it back into a pushchair.

To unfurl the chair, parents need to undo a clip and pull upwards. Collapsing it again is slightly more labour intensive as there are four steps.

While there are plenty of ‘compact’ options, deigned to free-up boot space, they all require that pieces un-clip and wheels have to be separately stowed.

But Doona’s folding mechanism is designed to be simple so it can be operated by one parent without any complications.

The Israel-based company, Simple Parenting, designed the convertible chair to ‘simplify the lives of parents and their babies’.

Founder Yoav Mazar named the product after his daughter, Danielle.

‘When my wife and I had our first daughter, we felt the need to spend as much quality time with her and took her everywhere. While we understood the importance of protecting her, the day-to-day use of infant car seats and strollers was agonising.

‘From my small designer’s workshop, I set a clear goal in mind: To transform the infant car seat into something safe yet simple and practical. This was the idea behind Doona.'

The Doona costs £299 and is available in seven colours.
