A designer is turning roadkill into high-end fashion in an attempt to prove that it is possible to source cruelty-free fur.

Patricia Paquin, the Vermont-based founder of fashion label Petite Mort, picks up discarded animal carcasses from the side of the road and turns the skins into a variety of beautiful fur accessories, from leg warmers to hand muffs which are all made to measure and range in price from $380 to $1,000.

'It's so much a part of everyday life to see these animals,' Paquin told Modern Farmer of her decision to start working with roadkill. 'Who of us doesn't look away? You don't want to see it because when you fully soak in the meaning of what happened, it's emotionally draining.'

And while some might be shocked at Paquin's slightly bizarre choice of materials, she points out that more than seven times as many animals die as a result of being hit by a car every year, than are killed for their fur each year. 

According to Culture Change, 1 million animals a day are killed by cars - or 365 million a year - in comparison to the 50 million which die as a result of fashion's ever-present need for fur. 

'The scale of it is so overwhelming — you can't possibly wrap your head around the suffering that went into those numbers,' Paquin added.

So high are America's roadkill numbers, that there has been a serious increase in the number of people turning to discarded roadside carcasses as a cheap source of meat. 

Last year saw a surge in 'roadkill cuisine' which is being marketed by experts as the 'ethical way to eat meat'.

When it comes to fashion, however, Paquin's set-up is completely unique, and something which has been years in the making.

Having finally decided to take the plunge and set up her business - after returning to the US following a seven-year stint living and working in Denmark - Paquin turned to a local taxidermist in Vermont, who taught her how to skin the discarded animals. 

'We both had a shot of whiskey, I put some peppermint oil under my nose, and we found a branch in the woods to hang this thing from,' she said of her first experience skinning an animal - a raccoon which she had found at the side of the road. 'It was super intense.'

While the process of preparing the furs might seem slightly brutal, Paquin's love and respect for animals is evident. 

Drawing on her Native American heritage, the designer blesses each body with a prayer to honor the animal spirit, before returning them to nature, leaving the animals in the woods near her studio.

And it seems that the fashion industry is staring to cotton on to the idea of ethical fur; Paquin's business is booming and orders for her bespoke roadkill designs are coming in thick and fast.

Thus far, she has fashioned everything from hats to gloves out of her roadkill furs, marking each one with a specially-designed silver disc so that they know it is a one-of-a-kind, ethical product. 

'People need to look at the fur and say okay, that’s Petite Mort, it’s an ethical fur,' she says of the distinctive label.
