Disgraced L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling has been spotted enjoying a romantic getaway with not one, but FOUR much younger woman.

Sterling, 80, was spotted checking into the JW Marriott resort in Palm Desert, California, on Friday evening with one of his bevy of beauties.

Eyewitnesses then reported seeing Sterling at various stages of the weekend with different women – two Asian and two African American – but there was no sign of either estranged wife Shelly Sterling or alleged ex-mistress V Stiviano.

Disgraced L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling, 80, has been spotted enjoying a romantic getaway with four much younger women at the JW Marriott resort in Palm Desert, California, over the weekend

Instagram user concert_mark posted this photo online of Sterling and one of his female friends relaxing at the pool at the JW Marriott resort in Palm Desert, California, over the weekend

‘He was with two Asian and two black women, but never all at once. It was two the first day and then two the second day at separate times,’ one hotel guest told RadarOnline.

The guest, who insisted on going by his Instagram handle concert_mark posted several photos of Sterling to his account, including one of the millionaire relaxing by the pool with one of his young entourage of girlfriends.

Sterling certainly wasn’t shy about being seen around the resort with his new companions and concert_mark said he believed it all for show, as if the octogenarian was trying to prove something in the wake of Stiviano leaking audio of him making racist remarks in April.

'He was obviously trying to be seen, at such a busy place and at the pool on a weekend. He strolled through the property with them a lot on his arm and it seemed like he was trying to prove he’s not a racist,' said concert_mark.

On Monday, Sterling was spotted lunching with a female companion at Villa Blanca in Beverly Hills

The octogenarian's hair was dyed to match his black t-shirt

'He was obviously trying to be seen, at such a busy place and at the pool on a weekend,' said one guest staying at the same hotel as Sterling

'He was having issues walking and you can tell he's not all there': One guest described Sterling's behavior as 'off' over the weekend

‘It was real obvious, the way he was laying with them. He was walking around with them and buying them stuff. My wife was very jealous of all the Louis Vuitton’s walking around!'

Sterling was also spotted on Monday lunching with a female companion at Villa Blanca in Beverly Hills.

In the wake of Sterling's racism scandal and lifetime NBA ban, there have been reports that he is suffering from Alzheimer’s, concert_mark told Radar that something appeared to be ‘off’ with Sterling.

‘He was having issues walking and you can tell he’s not all there,’ he said. ‘And he craps with the door open. I inadvertently followed him to the bathroom and there he was, door wide open. He refused to close it.’

Another guest had spotted Sterling checking in to the hotel on the Friday night. ‘Donald checked in the Marriott on Friday and was with a new much-younger girlfriend,’ the guest told Radar.

‘He didn’t seem to have a care in the world and it looked pretty clear why that chick was with him. They were being really affectionate with each other.’

A guest, who tweets as @cj_danvers, posted several photos on Twitter of the octogenarian hanging out at the hotel’s pool on Saturday.

In one of the tweeted photos Sterling can be seen walking away from the pool area with his arm around his young girlfriend who was dressed in a white robe

Eyewitnesses have reported the Sterling was all over his younger female friend who was most certainly not his estranged wife Shelly Sterling or his alleged ex-mistress V Stiviano

In one of the photos Sterling is walking 
away from the pool area with his arm around one of his young girlfriends
 who was dressed in a white robe.

Earlier Sterling and one of his female companions had been spotted shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue in Palm Desert.

Sterling has barely been out of the headlines since Stiviano leaked audio of him making racist remarks in April.

He quickly received a lifetime NBA ban, but has made it clear he doesn’t intend to go without a fight.

Earlier
 this month Sterling was photographed attending a black church service 
and then lunching with a group of young American American women.

There
 was much speculation that Sterling was making a rather blatant attempt 
to improve his profile after his racist comment and a disastrous 
interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper in which he blamed many of his 
troubles on Magic Johnson.

Cheap stunt? Earlier this month, Sterling attended the Praises of Zion Missionary Baptist Church in south LA with several African American women in tow

On Thursday, a source close to the disgraced LA Clippers owner revealed that he has hired private investigators to dig up dirt on NBA owners and commissioners.

Four investigative firms are said to have been given a six-figure budget and 30 days to look into whether any other owners have made off-color jokes, or racist or sexist remarks.

The individual said detectives were looking at the league's finances, allegations of previous discrimination and compensation to commissioner Adam Silver and predecessor David Stern.

Sterling is suing the NBA for 
$1billion in federal court after the league tried to oust him as 
Clippers owner for making racist remarks to a girlfriend that were 
publicised.

A trial will be held next month to 
determine whether Sterling was properly removed as an 
administrator for the family trust that owns the team.

The sports franchise was due to be sold for $2billion by his estranged wife Shelly Sterling last month to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, but he is now attempting to block the deal.

A
 probate court judge in Los Angeles Wednesday denied Shelly Sterling's 
urgent request to confirm her authority as sole administrator so that she could complete the sale.

Instead,
 the judge agreed to an expedited hearing because of looming sales 
deadlines.

The development 
is the latest in a legal tug-of-war following the NBA's decision to ban 
Donald Sterling for life after racist remarks to a girlfriend were 
recorded and publicized.

Court filings Wednesday indicated the 
NBA has set a hard deadline of Sept. 15. If the sale isn't completed 
then, the league will undertake proceedings to seize and sell the team 
on its own.

If that were to 
happen, Sterling would still receive any money from the sports 
franchise, but would not be able to negotiate terms.

Shelly Sterling, Donald's estranged wife, had been poised to sell the team for $2billion but the sale is now on hiatus
