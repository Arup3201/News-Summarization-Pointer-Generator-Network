Brendan Rodgers says Liverpool fans have promised him another famed European night at Anfield this evening.

The Liverpool manager savoured the club's return to Champions League football after a five year absence with a 2-1 win against Ludogorets Razgrad last month.

Yet tonight, when Liverpool take on European champions Real Madrid, Kopites have told Rodgers they will ramp up the atmosphere once again in the hope of inspiring his underdogs.

Liverpool fans have a history of producing a brilliant atmosphere at Anfield on Champions League nights

Anfield welcomed back Europe's premier club competition with a clash against Ludogorets 

'The fans will be massive against Madrid,' Rodgers told the club's official website. 'I remember talking to a couple of fans a few weeks back and haven't forgotten what they said. They told me: ''Just wait until you see the Real Madrid game''.

'So I've bore that in mind ever since and I know it's going to be a special night for them. It's a reward for them for their loyalty and the patience that they've shown with the team over the last number of years.'

Despite a 3-2 win at QPR on Sunday, Liverpool have been holding inquests about their form and fortunate nature of their victory but the Liverpool boss remains upbeat.

'Sometimes it's just about taking a step back. Last night I had a think about where we were when I came in and then realised that in a couple of nights' time we would be playing in the Champions League against Real Madrid. We're joint-fourth in the league and we haven't been near our form yet. There's lots to be positive about.'

Brendan Rodgers is primed for another stunning atmosphere as Liverpool welcome Real Madrid to Anfield

Liverpool's opponents trained at a weather-beaten Anfield on Tuesday night, shortly after Rodgers' players were put through their paces.

'You have to be mindful that they are arguably the best attack in world football at the moment, so you can't go gung-ho, that's for sure,' said Rodgers. 'On the counter-attack they are absolutely clinical. We've seen that over the course of the last year or so. But the confidence that a victory over a team such as Real Madrid can give you would be great. For us it's important because of the points - we want to qualify from the group stages.'

Rodgers hopes to have Lucas Leiva available for selection but confirmed that Mamadou Sakho will play no part in the fixture.

'We've obviously a couple of niggles from the game at the weekend but we'll see how that is,' said Rodgers. 'Lucas Leiva was out for the weekend, so we're hoping he'll be available for [Madrid]. Mamadou Sakho is still out, so he won't be available.
