They are yet more proof of the red planet's wet past.

The European Space Agency today released an astonishing series of pictures showing the remnants of a huge river than once ran across Mars.

Taken by the ESA’s Mars Express, they show Reull Vallis, the 'river-like structure' is believed to 
have formed when running water flowed in the distant martian past.

This computer-generated image of a river-like feature in the Reull Vallis region of Mars was created using data from the Mars Express spacecraft

The images were taken from data collected in the Reull Vallis region of Mars, shown here

It 
cut a steep-sided channel through the Promethei Terra Highlands 
before running on towards the floor of the vast Hellas basin. 

This astonishing structure, which stretches for almost 900 mile (1500 km) across the martian landscape, is flanked by numerous tributaries, one of which can be clearly seen cutting in to the main valley towards the upper (north) side.

Experts say the images show a 'striking resemblance 
to the morphology found in regions on Earth affected by glaciation'.

'For 
example, we can see circular step-like structures on the inner walls of 
the sediment-filled crater in the foreground of the second perspective 
view,' ESA said.

Planetary scientists think that these may represent former high 
water or glacial levels, before ice and water sublimated or evaporated 
away in stages at various times.

The new Mars Express image below shows a region of Reull Vallis at a point where the channel is almost 4 miles (7km) wide and 1,000 feet (300m) deep.

The sides of Reull Vallis are particularly sharp and steep in these images, ESA said, with parallel longitudinal features covering the floor of the channel itself.

The river-like channel is 7 km wide, and a depth of around 300m. It is believed to have been formed by flowing water, which cut through highland terrain and formed smooth plains.

These structures are believed to be 
caused by the passage of loose debris and ice during the ‘Amazonian’ 
period (which continues to this day) due to glacial flow along the 
channel.

The structures 
were formed long after it was originally carved by liquid water during 
the Hesperian period, which is believed to have ended between 3.5 
billion and 1.8 billion years ago.

Similar lineated structures, believed to be rich in ice, can also be found in many of the surrounding craters.

The Mars Express craft was also able to produce this 3D image of the area thanks to its twin cameras

The right (northern) part of the main 
image is dominated by the Promethei Terra Highlands with their high and 
soft-rounded mountains shown in these images, rising around 2500 m above
 the surrounding flat plains.

'The morphology of Reull Vallis suggests it has experienced a diverse and complex history, with analogies seen in glacial activity on Earth.

'These analogies are giving planetary geologists tantalising glimpses of a past on the Red Planet not too dissimilar to events on our own world today.'
