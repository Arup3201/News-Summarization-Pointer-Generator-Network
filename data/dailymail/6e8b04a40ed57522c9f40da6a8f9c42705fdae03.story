A 61-year-old has filed a lawsuit against Bank of America, claiming employees lost his mortgage payment and then harassed him to the extent he had a heart attack.

John Stecher claimed that mistakes from staff at the bank caused him undue stress and led to him  collapsing at a local branch in Charlotte, North Carolina.

He allegedly started getting calls from bank workers who warned him that his 'credit history would be negatively impacted,' if he did not pay, according to WSOC-TV.

Stress: John Stecher, who is suing the Bank of America, collapsed at this branch in Carmel Road, Charlotte, North Carolina, after he begged the manager to locate his mortgage payment

Mr Stecher finally went to the bank and begged 
the manager to find his payment.

As he stood in front of clerks, he became short of breath, collapsed and had 
to be rushed to the hospital.

Employees also said he was 'in jeopardy of foreclosure,' according to the lawsuit.

He was in good health before that day, and his doctors blamed the attack on stress,

Defence: Mr Stetcher's lawyer Paul Goodson said threats of foreclosure led his client to feel distressed

His lawyer, Paul Goodson, told the TV station that his client is suing for 'any amount to get their attention to pay more attention to their customers and their own mistakes.'

Bank of America had no comment on the pending lawsuit, which only said they are seeking damages of more than $10,000.

Goodson would not comment on how much he believes the bank owes his client but said the situation was more about money.

'Any amount to get their attention to pay more attention to their customers and their own mistakes,' Goodson said.

The lawyer also claimed the bank admitted it made a mistake a few days later and the mortgage payment had been made on time.

Files: The documents which have been filed to the court in preparation for Mr Stecher's case

Phone calls: The papers include quotes from bank employees who told the plaintiff his credit history would be negatively impacted

Response: The Bank of America said they had no comment over the pending lawsuit (file picture)
