Probe: Fraud investigator Simon Sutton, pictured, is said to have been hired by Michelle Young to pursue he ex-husband Scot for money

Michelle Young hired a controversial private detective to pursue her former husband for money just weeks before he died, it emerged last night.

The divorcee employed fraud investigator Simon Sutton, even though her former husband Scot - who plunged to his death from a London flat on Monday - had claimed he was being hounded to the point of madness.

During Britain’s most high-profile divorce case it was alleged that Mrs Young, now 49, had used eight private detectives to try to prove her husband, 52, had hidden his immense fortune from her.

Mr Young said at the time that being followed persistently made him ‘paranoid’ and eventually led to him being sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

Yesterday, it emerged Mrs Young employed Nevyan Intelligence Services in recent weeks to renew attempts to track down funds she believed her former husband had hidden from her.

The company is run by Mr Sutton, 43, an Oxford graduate who claims to have more than 20 years’ experience in fraud and corruption investigations across Europe, Asia, Western Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean.

Mr Sutton, who lives with his wife and children in a £250,000 home in Hungerford, Berkshire, has had a series of failed companies and Nevyan is rated as ‘high risk’, having faced two county court judgements over debts amounting to £4,665.

Its official ‘registered office’ is an empty shop in a Berkshire village, which yesterday had a ‘To Let’ sign in the window.

Mrs Young will have had to have paid in advance for Mr Sutton’s firm’s services, according to the policy laid out on the company’s website.

An online review of Mr Sutton’s service from August 2012 states: ‘He takes hugely inflated fees 100 per cent in advance then delivers nothing. He is supposed to be a fraud investigator but uses that as a cover to rip customers off.’

Mr Sutton’s LinkedIn profile claims he has ‘15 years’ experience in global fraud investigations, including corporate fraud, money laundering embezzlement, insurance fraud, corruption, missing persons, asset investigation, due diligence, kidnap and financial crime investigation’.

Last night, he told the Mail: ‘I am not in a position to talk about the case, unfortunately. I am sorry, I can’t discuss it.’

Mrs Young declined to comment on Mr Sutton’s involvement in the case.

It has since emerged that one detective used by Mrs Young – former MI6 spy Mark Hill-Wood – has been investigated by police for defrauding her after she had paid £14,000 to his private detective agency, Full-Proof Intelligence.
