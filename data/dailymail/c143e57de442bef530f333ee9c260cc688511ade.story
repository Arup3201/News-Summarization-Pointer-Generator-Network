Last night saw a galaxy of stars, including some of tinsel town's most beautiful women, walk the red carpet to celebrate the biggest night in Britain's showbiz calendar: the BAFTAS.

Thespians such as Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett and Amy Adams looked picture perfect as they faced a gauntlet of flashbulbs. But, however genetically blessed they may be, you can be sure they didn't wake up looking that flawless.

From expert make-up artists to nail technicians - and even handbag carriers - the A-listers called in their loyal team of experts who worked like a well-oiled machine to ensure that they were ready for their close ups.

FEMAIL hit the red carpet at last night's EE BAFTA Awards to get the low down on the star's fashion and beauty preparations.

The gong for the most glamorous red carpet star undoubtedly went to Lupita Nyong’O. The 12 Years a Slave actress ensured all eyes were on her in a striking emerald green silk fishtail-hem gown by Christian Dior.

Make up Artist Kay Montano was responsible for created Lupita's flawless look. 'Having a fearless actress who loves colour is a dream job for a make-up artist,' she told us.

'When I saw the dress, I knew that I needed to do something that combined sophisticated polish with bold colour and Lupita is the perfect canvas.'

Lupita's glowing skin came courtesy of Lancome Air De Teint and her eyelids were washed with Lancome's Hypnose palette.

'I absolutely loved this look - it was 
strong and bold and the colour of her dress looked fantastic against her
 skin. The sharp haircut and her beautiful bone structure gave a nod 
towards a young Grace Jones,' hair partner Charles Worthington told us.

Lily Allen, meanwhile, opted for a more quirky look flying the flag for British fashion in a colour block Vivienne Westwood gown.

'It took me about four hours to get ready, do I look alright?', Lily joked on the red carpet.

While her colourful look, complete with matching oversized hair accessory, might not be to everyone's taste, Lily was brave enough to make a bold statement - no doubt a nod of support to Vivienne, who showed her AW14 collection earlier in the evening.

In true BAFTA style, everything was a little last minute for French actress, Olga Kurylenko.

It's all under control: Michelle Rodriguez, our favourite red carpet star of the evening, had an assistant on hand to ensure her cleavage baring dress stayed put

'We had a last minute phone call to do Olga's hair so Marc Trinder, one of my stylists, had to jump in a high speed car and rush over to Chelsea in true James Bond style to tame her locks,' explained Charles.

'The dress inspired the look with tumbling mermaid-esque waves completing her red carpet ensemble.'

As for her make-up, Alex Babsky from Lancome said of Olga’s look: 'I wanted to enhance Olga’s features with a pretty make up using neutrals throughout the look.;

She achieved the star's dewy look with Lancome Teint Idole Ultra as a base and added a flush of Lancome Blush Subtil to her cheekbones.

The power couple of the evening award most certainly went to Brangelina, who rocked up in slick matching suits.

Unlike most of the stars, who had a team of hair fixers and even handbag carriers in tow, the A-list couple made do without - Angelina even tenderly fixed Brad's collar for him before he had his picture taken.

Michelle Rodriguez made sure all eyes were on her as she made an entrance at the awards in a sexy leather trimmed dress that dipped dangerously low.

'Gosh, I don't even know how to pronounce the name of the designer,' the likeable American told us.

'Emilio De La Morena, darling,' a helpful male friend informed her, as she struggled to pronounce the Spanish designer's name.

Nibbling on her Vape e-cigarette, Michelle told us she is having a blast in London and loves the 'energy' of our capital city.

Her rumoured girlfriend, Cara Delevingne, was busy at her own fashion party for Mulberry but Michelle didn't let that stop her from having a good time.

A helpful assistant ensured that she avoided a fashion faux-pas as he adjusted her daring dress.

'I don't want anything popping out,' Michelle joked before she posed for the awaiting photographers.

She said: 'I prepped the hair by spraying ohn Frieda Luxurious Volume Fine to Full Blow-out Spray throughout the hair.

'Next, blow-dry the hair with a small round brush pinning each secttion, then allow time to cool off. The hair should be sprayed lightly and tussled with fingers to create texture before loosely plaiting.

'For the finishing touches - pull hair back and secure with pins at the nape of the neck.

'The whole look was held in place by a fine mist of John Frieda Luxurious Volume All-Day Hold Hairpray.'

Samantha Barks stunned in a beautiful slinky Calvin Klein dress. 'We wanted to create a slightly regal look with her hair so we decided on gentle, loosely looped braids,' Charles told us.

'Samantha has such a delicate face and we didn't want it to be lost under all of her hair so we thought that pulling it back, whilst keeping it quite soft and romantic, would create a beautiful, young, fresh and effortless look.'

Shehla Shaikh of Lancome gave Samantha 'glowing sun-kissed skin, defined eyes, nude lips, using a hero product, Lancôme Star Bronzer Intense.

Youtube blogger Tanya Burr brightened up the red carpet in a yellow Coast dress. 'I am supporting the high street tonight,' she told us.

The 24-year-old has just unveiled her own beauty range and was rocking one of her new lip glosses, naturally.

Another young star flying the flag for the British high street was Emma Thompson's daughter, Gaia, who wore an outfit and and shoes from Topshop.

Sai Bennett, the Mr Selfridge actress, who will appear in The Face of An Angel alongside Cara Delevingne, looked effortlessly cool in Chanel.

'Sai is quite new to the red carpet and as she's perfecting her red carpet style she wanted to experiment with old school Hollywood siren glamour,' said Charles.

'She had chosen that beautiful Chanel dress and with such lovely, thick, lustrous hair it was an easy decision for us to style her hair into tumbling waves. Pulling the hair round to one side allowed her to show off that beautiful statement pearl earring - she really shone on her first BAFTA red carpet.'

Uma Thurman, dazzling in Versace Atelier, was given a 'classic timeless' beauty look by Lancome make-up artist Kelly Cornwell, while Downton Abbey star Laura Carmichael stayed true to her quintessentially British character.

'For Laura, I created an elongated and softly defined eye, by winging the colour out and up for a feline effect, finished with English rose skin,' explained Lancome make up Artist Alex Babsky.

Naomi Harris was another style sweetheart and while all eyes may have been on her vibrant pink Gucci gown, we couldn't help but noticed her on-trend gothic nails.

'We chose Orly’s Liquid Vinyl to complete Naomi’s sexy and sleek look,' manicurist Karen Louise told us.

'I kept her nail shape simple and elegant and the jet black polish perfectly complemented the black detailing in her outfit from the Gucci dress black belt, to her Rauwolf clutch, to her Christian Louboutins.'
