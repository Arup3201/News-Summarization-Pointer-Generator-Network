Eric Abidal has been officially unveiled as an Olympiacos player.

The French left-back signed for the Greek champions early last month, but was only pictured with his new shirt on Monday.

Abidal held up his favoured No 22 shirt as he was presented inside his new club’s Karaiskaki Stadium in Piraeus, the port town near Athens.

The 34-year-old, who was diagnosed with a liver tumour in 2011, has also represented Lyon and Barcelona and lifted the Champions League trophy for the latter in the same year, having been handed the captain’s armband in honour of his recovery.

Olympiacos’ managing director, Ioannis Vrentzos, was full of praise for the veteran defender, describing him as 'nothing short of a jewel for our club.' He added: '[He is] a fantastic football player, an incredible athlete, but most of all a remarkable individual.'

Strategic advisor Christian Karembeu also told the assembled media that Abidal would help strengthen the club’s partnership with UNICEF, the charity with whom Olympiacos have a strong association.

Speaking at a press conference which also featured build-up to the team’s friendly with Athletic Bilbao this Wednesday, Abidal spoke of his delight at joining Greece’s most successful club.

Happy: Abidal says it is 'truly a great joy' to sign for Olympiacos after leaving French club Monaco

He said 'It is truly a great joy for me to have signed with such a top club like Olympiacos. I will try really hard to contribute with my knowledge and experience and help the club.'

The signing, when announced last month, was hugely surprising, especially as the Frenchman had only just penned a year’s contract at Monaco. 

His departure has been put down to Monaco’s decision not to sign Abidal’s former Barcelona team-mate Victor Valdes, which the defender reportedly sees as a broken promise. The goalkeeper is a free agent after ending his association with the Catalan giants which spanned more than 20 years.

It remains unclear whether the Greek club, who have also signed Dutchman Ibrahim Afellay on loan this week, paid a fee to Monaco for Abidal’s services.
