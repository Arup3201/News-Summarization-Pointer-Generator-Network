A newly-divorced high school assistant principal has been arrested after allegedly having sex with one of her teenage students.

Catherine Michele Bell, 33, turned herself in to the Shelby County Jail in Alabama on Thursday afternoon after a warrant was put out for her arrest.

Bell, who has a four-year-old son with her ex-husband, has been charged with three counts of 'engaging in a sex act or deviant sexual intercourse' with a student under the age of 19.

She was held in the Shelby County Jail but was released later on Thursday evening after posting $90,000 bond.

Bell, from Alabaster, was one of four assistant 
principals at Pelham High School, attended by around 800 students, until she resigned in November.

Court records show she and her husband Jeff 
divorced in August and have shared custody of their young son, AL.com reported.

The sheriff's office launched an investigation after being contacted by the Pelham Police Department, Capt. Ken Burchfield told the news sites.

Authorities would not release specifics about the allegations against Bell and did not reveal the age of her alleged victim.

Shelby County Schools spokeswoman Cindy Warner said they would not be answering questions but released a statement saying they took the allegations seriously.

'The school district took immediate action when we were first made aware of the allegations,' she said. 'The employee was placed on administrative leave while the matter was being investigated by the school district, with the assistance of local law enforcement.

'She subsequently resigned from her position on November 21.'

Shelby County parents told WBRC that they are frustrated about this latest case - which comes less than two weeks after another teacher in the county pleaded guilty to similar charges.

'It's disheartening to hear that happened once again,' said Heather Bennett.

'You're already worried about the 
safety of your children with all the school shootings, on top of the 
fact you can't trust you teachers, much less a principal now.'

Bell's
attorny Tommy Spina said that Bell has fully cooperated with law 
enforcement and school officials since the allegations emerged.

Spina added that the statute she has been charged under makes it illegal for any school employee to have sexual contact with a student, whether or not they are above the age of consent.

'It's essentially a strict liability statute, rare in criminal cases, which normally requires a specific intent to do something the law forbids,' he added to AL.com.
