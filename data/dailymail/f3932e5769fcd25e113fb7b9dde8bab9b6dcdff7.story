Tony Bellew risked being hauled before the boxing authorities after alleging Nathan Cleverly has a problem with alcohol ahead of their highly-charged rematch.

As the pair squared up during a heated head-to-head on Thursday, Bellew asked: ‘Been to any AA meetings lately?’

The jibe was taken to refer to Alcoholics Anonymous but Cleverly dismissed the accusation and predicated Bellew will have to answer to the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC).

‘I honestly don’t know what he’s referring to,’ he said. ‘He tried personal insults before the first fight and this AA one is a new one. He’s desperate to rattle me but I’m too strong. He’s making these things up and waffling on. He needs a good slap and he’s going to get one.

‘There should be a line but that just sums him up as a person. There’s no boundary with him, he’s horrible.

‘Who doesn’t enjoy life around work? I do but to make an accusation like that is insulting to me.

‘It’s no major issue to me but on a wider horizon, in terms of the Boxing Board, they’ll probably do something about it.

‘You can’t have idiots like him making accusations.’

The BBBC’s General Secretary Robert Smith told Sportsmail: ‘Mr Cleverly has no history of alcohol abuse. He has passed every medical and blood test and has never caused us concern.

The two fighters will meet on Saturday night in their second clash, but their first as cruiserweights

‘We will look at the whole interview but I cannot comment until I’ve seen it.’ Bellew later played dumb when asked to explain the retort.

He said: ‘What does AA mean? What’s that? I’m just saying what does AA stand for?’

When it was explained, he added mockingly: ‘Is it? Is that what he’s been up to? For an athlete like that to attend those classes, a strong-minded athlete! We’ve opened a can of worms haven’t we? I can’t believe it!

‘He said he hasn’t been for 18 months. I seem to know an awful lot more about him than he knows about me.

‘I’m just letting people know he is not this clean-cut guy that he likes to pretend he is, going on as if I’m some street thug.

‘This guy can’t even stay on the straight and narrow for himself.

‘I’ve had this guy call me everything under the sun for the last three years. I’ve had this guy try and pick apart my career for the last three years. I’ve had this guy make snipes at me for the last three years. I gave this guy all the respect when we fought but what does he do?

‘He basically p***** on my chips and tries to make a fool of me. Does that sound to you like a respectful kind of reply? So I’m just repaying back what’s been given to me.’

The rivalry that has bubbled under the surface since the pair’s first fight in 2011 will reach boiling point at this afternoon’s weigh-in, the final time the fighters will meet before the first bell at Liverpool’s Echo Arena on Saturday night.

Bellew claims his hatred of Cleverly stems from comments he made in the aftermath of their world title fight when he said he had been in ‘second gear’. Cleverly believes Bellew is jealous of his three-year reign as champion.

The two boxers are held apart during their head-to-head on Thursday ahead of their weekend fight 

Both men suffered defeats last year in what proved to be their final outing at light heavyweight.

Cleverly was beaten up and stopped over four torrid rounds by Sergey Kovalev while Bellew was knocked out by another world champion in Adonis Stevenson three months later.

Having both moved up to cruiserweight, two routine victories apiece have set them up for this long-awaited rematch.

‘I took time out, freshened up, found my new weight and I feel great,’ Cleverly added. ‘This is the acid test.

‘If he lands and I see the red mist I might go after this guy — the last man standing will prevail and I think that’s me.’

Cleverly considered retiring after his devastating defeat to Kovalev, a sign, says Bellew, of weakness.

‘We’ll find out who is mentally strong,’ he said. ‘When he gets hit clean, lets see if he wants to come back and trade.

‘It’s getting real now and it’s getting close. I’m relaxed, I’m calm, I’m not an angry man. I’ve seen all this before, it’s just business.’
