Millionaire property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz could be thrown out of his £50million Kensington mansion after a £183million grab on his assets by a failed Icelandic bank was sanctioned in court.

His grand four-story property, which sits by the Royal Albert Hall, is one of London's most prestigious houses and was used as Harry Selfridge's home in the ITV show Mr Selfridge.

Kaupthing Bank collapsed during the financial crisis of 2008, and had allowed Mr Tchenguiz to borrow £1.6billion from them before it went to the wall.

Grandure: His beautiful home, which sits beside the Royal Albert Hall, is being pursued by liquidators representing the failed Icelandic bank Kaupthing. It was used in ITV drama 'Mr Selfridge' starring Jeremy Piven

Exposure: The property, shown here during Mr Selfridge filming, is said to be worth £50million and is one of three assets said to be being pursued via the courts in Guernsey

Last month liquidators successfully gained 
an order from the Royal Court of Guernsey allowing them to take assets 
from him, including his house, which was the former home of the Royal 
College of Organists.

His interests in BAE's Hampshire headquarters and a huge Leicestershire BT distribution centre could also be pursued.

Mr
 Tchenguiz has appealed against the ruling but laws on the Channel 
Islands mean his assets can still be taken before a new hearing due 
to take place in St Peter Port as early as next month, MailOnline 
understands.

A decade ago Robert and his sibling Vincent were reportedly worth around £4.5billion but this has now dropped to an estimated £850million.

Robbie, as he is known to friends, is married with two children and once had a relationship with model Caprice.

He has gained a reputation for partying and when he turned 40 it was reported he splashed £100,000 on a Louis XIV-themed event and hired acrobats from the world famous Cirque du Soleil.

Every August he spends the month on his 150ft yacht My Little Violet - named after his daughter - on the Cote d’Azur, mooring near an even bigger yacht owned by his elder brother.

But he also became known he man who lost £1billion in 24 hours during the ­Icelandic banking ­crisis.

In recent years the Serious Fraud Office also brought a series of cases against him and his brother, but these collapsed because of a lack of evidence.

They then sued the SFO for £300million because their offices were illegally raided in 2011. The SFO's bungled inquiry meant they also had to pay 80 per cent of the legal costs.

The Icelandic claim against him was revealed in The Times today after a series of court orders were made in Guernsey.

MailOnline understands there has been prolonged legal argument about where the litigation should take place, with the British Virgin Islands also considered.

Mr Tchenguiz's appeal would most likely be pencilled in for April, as they are held quarterly in Guernsey, but the Royal Court there could choose to bring it forward.

Until then Stephen Akers, one of the
liquidators, admitted they were 'moving forward with enforcement' although there is likely to be legal ramifications if he is evicted from his home, The Times said.
