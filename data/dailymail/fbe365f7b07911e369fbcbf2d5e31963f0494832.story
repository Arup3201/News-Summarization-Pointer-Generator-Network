A Canadian couple are accused of getting amorous on a day time flight in January.

Jason George Chase, 39, and Alicia Elizabeth Lander, 25, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to committing an indecent act in their seats on the Air Canada plane, during a flight from Toronto to Halifax that took less than two hours.

The pair were arrested January 24 after arriving at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport.

Royal Canadian Mountain Police have not revealed the exact nature of the alleged sex act but have said it wasn't intercourse.

Nor will they confirm whether Chase and Lander were in a relationship or had just met.

The Chronicle Herald quoted sources as saying Chase's spouse was waiting for him at the airport.

When they touched down, they were met by mounties at the gate.

Lander proceeded to be verbally abusive and kicked officers as they were arrested, police say.

Airport sources added that she kicked a hole in the RCMP interview room wall.

She faces the additional charges of causing a disturbance, assaulting a police officer and mischief.

The accused were not in Dartmouth provincial court on Tuesday but their defense lawyers entered the pleas on their behalf.

The trial has been set for January 21, 2015.

Lyle Howe, Lander's lawyer, told CBC News his client decided to plead not guilty to those charges as well after receiving disclosure from the Crown.

'We've reviewed the paperwork and we've decided that that's what we were going to enter as our plea,' he told reporters.

'Any time somebody is alleged to have committed a criminal offense is a difficult ordeal.'

Lander is from the tiny community of West Porters Lake, Nova Scotia. Chase is from Halifax.
