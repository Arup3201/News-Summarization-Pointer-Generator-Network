Found? Police say remains found in Idaho might belong to Josh Reddington who vanished in 2000

A dismembered body found in an isolated cabin in Idaho appears to be a man who vanished 14 years ago after he was last seen with the son of a Chicago hitman, police have said.

Skeletal remains that were discovered in an isolated cabin near Idaho City likely belong to Josh Reddington, from Salmon, who was 25 when he disappeared in 2000, Idaho State Police said.

He was last seen with Michael Dauber, 45, who was arrested in March on suspicion of the murder of another man, his roommate Steven Kalogerakos, who was shot dead in December 2007.

Dauber, who remains locked up, is the son of notorious mafia hitman William 'Billy' Dauber, who was gunned down with his wife in 1980. 

Kalogerakos' dismembered body parts were uncovered last year in a makeshift grave in rugged mountainous terrain near Idaho City, prosecutors have said.

At his bond hearing for Kalogerakos' death, Boise County Prosecutor Ian Gee said Dauber had chopped up Kalogerakos using an axe and a bone saw. He then put the pieces into a plastic bag and dumped the evidence into a shallow grave several miles from Idaho City, the prosecutor said, the Boise Weekly reported.

No one has yet been charged in Reddington's death, which 'appears to be a homicide,' Idaho State Police said. Dauber has long been referred to as a person of interest in the case.

It will be several weeks before a positive identification can be obtained and evidence analyzed to determine a cause of Reddington's death, they said. 

Like father like son? Reddington was last seen with Michael Dauber, left, who is in jail for allegedly killing and dismembering his roommate in 2007. His father, Billy Dauber, right, was a Chicago mobster in the 70s and died in 1980 alongside his wife in a hail of bullets when his relationship with his bosses turned sour

His mother, Vera Pohto of Salmon, said authorities had contacted her earlier this week to ask her son's shoe size and later confided that they strongly suspected the remains belonged to him.

'I want to know if it is him for sure but I feel in my heart it is him,' she said on Wednesday. 'It's a relief to know he has been found even though his body has been all chopped up.'

Reddington, a helicopter logger, was last seen by his mother just before Memorial Day weekend in 2000 when he and Dauber stopped in Salmon before traveling to Idaho City for work, Pohto said.

Searches over the years led nowhere and police had no new leads when the sheriff in Salmon attended an FBI workshop on disappearances and serial killers and asked state and federal authorities to reopen the cold case, she said. 

Killed: Steven Kalogerakos was shot dead and dismembered in 2007 before the pieces of his body were dumped in a ditch near Idaho City. His remains were found last year and Dauber Jr. was arrested in March

Dauber Sr. was suspected in more than 30 unsolved murders between throughout the 70s. In 1973, he was convicted of mail fraud and transporting a stolen car across state lines.

After his release, his relationships with his former fellow mobsters soured.

In July 2, 1980, he was driving back from court on gun charges when a group of men in a van shot at his car and he crashed into a tree, the Chicago Tribune reported. Both he and his wife died.

Michael Dauber was just 12 when his father and stepmother were killed. He moved to Idaho in 1994 and Kalogerakos, who he'd known since he was a boy, lived with him for three months before his death.
