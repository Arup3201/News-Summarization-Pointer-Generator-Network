Russia's most popular American actor, a Minnesota native who stars in the country's highest rated sitcom, has come out as gay.

Odin Biron, a 30-year-old from Duluth, revealed his sexuality last week in a magazine interview that came as a surprise not just to the nearly 4 million regular viewers of his hospital comedy Interns, but to his co-stars, as well.

It also happens that one of those fellow actors, 48-year-old Ivan Okhlobystin, is a former Orthodox priest who's made a name for himself in part with his outspoken condemnation of both gays and America.

Risky reveal? Odin Biron stars in one of Russia's highest rated television shows and has come out as gay

Outspoken: Biron's co-star Ivan Okhlobystin is one of the country's loudest and most vehement anti-gay and anti-American voices

But the homophobia of Biron's co-workers and, some might say, of the country where he's made a living for the last 10 years, was not enough to stop him from outing himself in New York Magazine last Monday.

'At a time when sexual minorities in Russia face greater adversity, both socially and legally, than at any time in recent memory, I feel compelled to use my unique platform to speak out,' Biron said in a statement that followed his New York Magazine reveal.

A ban on propaganda of 'nontraditional sexual relations' that was signed by President Vladimir Putin into law in June 2013 provoked widespread international outrage from critics who believe the legislation discriminates against gays.

But it also was met with applause from many in Russian. Among them was Biron's boisterous co-star Okhlobystin, who then took it upon himself to one-up even Putin.

 'I would put all the gays alive into an oven,' Okhlobystin was quoted as saying. 'This is Sodom and Gomorrah! As a religious person, I cannot be indifferent about it because it is a real threat to my children!'

Not surprisingly, Okhlobystin--who's also claimed he would gladly bomb America off the face of the earth--was not pleased when he heard Biron's announcement.

He took to Twitter to announce him displeasure to the world, reports NBC News, and said he was 'cursing fate' after learning his friend and co-star 'is a Sodomite.' 

'Some things are better not known. Lord preserve us from this devilry,' he said.

The two men will be back on set for the sixth season of their popular show in a few weeks. 

But Biron told New York Magazine that the passing of the propaganda got him mulling a return to the United States.

Whether his eventual departure from Russia is expedited by his coming out, Biron doesn't seem to care. 

'If my coming out publicly can give hope to anyone, or encourage them to do the same, then the sacrifice of my privacy is worth it,' he said.

Biron and Okhlobystin star in the 'Scrubs'-like comedy Interns. After learning of his co-star's announcement, Okhlobystin tweeted, 'some things are better not known. Lord preserve us from this devilry'
