West Bromwich Albion have opened the door to the sale of Saido Berahino this month as Tony Pulis looks to shape his squad for the battle against relegation.

Chairman Jeremy Peace has previously insisted the England Under-21 striker would not leave the Hawthorns but with the arrival of Pulis technical director Terry Burton revealed a softer stance.

Liverpool and Tottenham are monitoring the situation but yet to make a bid, with Burton insisting it would take a much greater fee than £20million.

West Brom could be tempted to accept an offer for striker Saido Berahino if it matches their valuation 

Technical director Terry Burton suggested the Baggies could be ready to cash in for Berahino

Burton was talking as West Brom unveiled Tony Pulis as their new head coach on Friday 

'Tony is a totally realistic football manager,’ said Burton. 'He will do and work whatever way is best for the football club.

'He tries to win football matches and if he needs to sell somebody to do something else he will sell them.

'He will do whatever is best to get results for the club and that could involve any aspect of the policy.

'Whatever he wants we will work our hardest to make happen. Tony is in total charge.' It was suggested a £20m bid might test the waters. 'I don't think he would take that small amount of money,’ Burton replied. 'He is worth what some club would pay for him.

'If a club want a player bad enough and they are top quality players and if they have the finances the try and do that.' Burton confirmed West Brom have halted negotiations over a new deal for Berahino. 

'Yes the club have just put that on hold for now. He had quite a lot going on at one time and they have just put it on hold to let things settle down and see where we go.’
