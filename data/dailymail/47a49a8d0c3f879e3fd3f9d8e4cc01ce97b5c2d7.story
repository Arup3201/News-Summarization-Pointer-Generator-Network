Cardiff's approach to talk to Leyton Orient manager Russell Slade about their vacant managerial post has been rejected by the League One club.

The Championship club have been without a manager since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer left the Bluebirds last Thursday and 53-year-old Slade has emerged as the surprise favourite to fill the position.

'On Friday morning we were contacted by a lawyer close to Cardiff City and Russell Slade, who asked us to give permission for Cardiff to talk to Russell,' said a Leyton Orient club statement on Monday.

Vincent Tan and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer parted company after defeat to Middlesbrough on Tuesday 

'That evening Russell asked the club for permission to talk to Cardiff. On Saturday the general manager of Cardiff approached us in order to again ask permission to talk to Russell.

'In all cases, we denied Cardiff the permission and we did not authorise Russell to talk to Cardiff.'

Slade, who held talks with Orient owner Francesco Becchetti regarding his own position last week, has been in charge at Brisbane Road since 2010 and on Saturday said he was 'proud' to be linked with Cardiff.
