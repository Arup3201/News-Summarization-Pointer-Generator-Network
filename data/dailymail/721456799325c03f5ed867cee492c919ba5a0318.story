Eden Hazard has ruled out any chance of leaving Chelsea for Paris Saint-Germain – despite continued interest from the mega-rich French champions.

The PFA Young Player of the Year was continually linked with a move to Laurent Blanc’s side this summer but Jose Mourinho said he would only listen to offers of over £150million for his star playmaker.

And despite starting his career in Ligue 1 with Lille before joining Chelsea for £32million in 2012, Hazard says he has no intention of crossing the channel again.

Belgian international Eden Hazard has been increasingly linked with a move back to Ligue 1 with PSG

The Blues are set to reward their No 10 for his fine form last season with a new five-year contract worth £200,000-per-week and expect him to put pen to paper next month.

‘PSG are in the same world than Chelsea,’ Hazard told Canal+ ‘But, to be a top club they need to win the Champions League. I'm fine with Chelsea and this is where I want to continue to grow. PSG are not in my head.’

Hazard made no secret that Chelsea’s 2012 Champions League final win over Bayern Munich made a big impact on his decision to move to West London – and his mention of the big-eared trophy with relation to PSG seems to make it highly unlikely he would move to the Financial Fair Play-hit club.

Hazard added: ‘Move back to Ligue 1? Maybe one day. But only for Lille. Ligue 1 is a great league in Europe but not the best. It's a league for youngsters.’

Hazard and his Chelsea team-mates fly to Portugal on Monday ahead of their Champions League tie against Sporting Lisbon hoping to improve on their performance from their opening group game – a 1-1 draw at home against Schalke.
