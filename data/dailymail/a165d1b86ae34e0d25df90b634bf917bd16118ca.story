A chef has been forced to quit his job - because he's allergic to knives and forks.

Cameron Robertson, 21, of Tillicoultry in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, comes out in an itchy rash whenever he comes into contact with cutlery.

He said: 'Work was becoming impossible.'

The former trainee cook had to flee the galley after discovering he was allergic to metal - making a steel-lined kitchen his worst possible working environment.

Unlucky: Cameron Robertson had to quit his job as chef because he's allergic to knives and forks

Hours spent training in the Stirling House Hotel kitchen would leave him itching for days.

But a trip to the doctor after a year of constant scratching revealed it was in fact metal in cutlery and his surroundings that was causing his ill-health, forcing him to quit.

Mr Robertson said: 'I trained as a chef for two years before getting a full-time job and it was then that my hands and arms started to itch.

'Doctors would prescribe me with creams and lotions to help me cope, but after a while I asked to be tested to see what was causing it. That's when I found out that I was allergic to metal.'

After two years of suffering, doctors discovered Mr Robertson is allergic to metal

With his confidence at rock bottom, Mr 
Robertson considered applying for a trade, but when he offered his 
church a hand renovating an old shop into a community cafe, he 
discovered he was also allergic to concrete.

The culinary enthusiast, who also suffers from eczema, discovered his allergy is triggered by elements present in most metals.

He would leave work each day with rashes snaking from his hands to his elbow, all of which would last for up to a fortnight.

After a torrid spell where he was unable to work at all, Mr Robertson, was left with no choice but to give up his dream job.

He said: 'I love cooking so was really upset, but everything in the kitchen was metal, so it was a real problem.

'I can use cutlery to eat a meal during the day, but if I was to be using it all day - like I did when I was training as a chef - that would cause an allergic reaction.

'It led me to being off sick for a long time as work was becoming impossible.

'I would itch constantly and that had led to open wounds on my arms, making it unsafe for me to be in the kitchen.'

The 21-year-old is now working as a care assistant.

Mr Robertson - who lives at home with mum Marie, 54, and dog Cheeko - added: 'My allergies could have a considerable effect on my day-to-day living, but I've learned to live in a way that suits me.

'I just can't have prolonged contact with either metal or concrete and that's fine by me.'
