Struggle: Jim Wolf, 54, has gone to jail weeks after he had a makeover in a viral video

A homeless Army veteran who underwent an incredible transformation in a timelapse video that became an internet hit has been jailed for causing a disturbance in a Burger King.

Jim Wolf, a former soldier from Grand Rapids, Michigan, featured in the video, which shows stylists cutting his scraggly beard and hair and dressing him in a dapper suit, in September.

The video explained that the 54-year-old had slipped into a life of alcoholism and destitution but had 'taken control of his life' - with alcohol treatment and housing on the horizon.

But a police report now indicates that the transformation has not been as easy as it appeared for Wolf, as he was arrested at a Burger King on Sunday November 17.

He was charged with trespassing and creating a disturbance, Mlive reported, and on Monday he pleaded guilty to both charges.

District Judge Michael Christensen ordered Wolf to serve 10 days in jail on each charge.

Wolf had previously WOOD-TV on Wednesday that he appreciated the efforts of Dégagé Ministries, the organization behind his makeover, but admitted that he had gone back to drinking.

'I have no excuse for what I do wrong,' he said. 'It is all me putting a bottle to my mouth.'

Grand Rapids Police have arrested Wolf more than 80 times in the past as he has battled alcoholism, substance abuse and mental illness.

He added that despite his return to 
jail, he said he still had great hopes for the future, including getting
treatment for his alcoholism.

'With the help I'm going to receive, I believe I can become clean,' Wolf said.

Rob Bliss, who made the video, said he hoped it would help Wolf start a new life, but said he knew it would be hard.

'If he gets arrested fewer times this year than last, that's progress,' he told CNN.

Job done: The video said he had turned his life around but Wolf has since admitted he is drinking again

Diane Birtles, director of shelter 
services at Mel Trotter Ministries in Grand Rapids, told Mlive: 
'Addiction and homelessness is a complex condition. It’s not solved as 
simply as the video might indicate.'

The video had shown him undergoing a complete makeover by christian support charity Dégagé Ministries which 'offers help and hope to homeless and disadvantaged individuals in our community'.

The profoundly moving video, directed 
by Rob Bliss, begins with Wolf sitting in a chair looking at the camera 
in a grubby t-shirt and tracksuit.

Then, armed only with a pair of scissors, a comb, clippers and some dye, stylist Anna Walt attacks his hair, snipping, buzzing and coloring.

Gradually his tousled locks are 
replaced by a crisp short-back-and-sides and his beard reduced to 
designer stubble. Bliss then puts him in a sharp suit and tie and the 
metamorphosis is complete.

Wolf, who had not seen himself 
throughout the transformation, said 'wow' when a full-length mirror was 
turned toward him and he finally saw his reflection.

'The
homeless are people we ignore every day,' Bliss told The Blaze. '[But] 
they can look like they’re meant for the cover of GQ — they have that 
potential too.'
