Ravel Morrison has undergone a minor groin procedure during pre-season which, according to West Ham, was a complete success.

The club website said: 'The 21-year-old was diagnosed with the condition during pre-season testing and had a minor procedure at a central London hospital on Tuesday afternoon.

'The operation was completed without complications and, following a period of rehabilitation, it is expected the England U21 midfielder will return to training in a few weeks when the first-team squad return from New Zealand.'

Success: Ravel Morrison has undergone groin surgery during pre-season

Loan spell: The midfielder spent the second half of last season at QPR

Morrison has scored five goals in 22 games for West Ham since joining in 2012.

He started last season superbly in the Premier League, including the Hammers Goal of the Season against Tottenham in November, but he fell out of favour soon afterwards, spending the second half of the season on loan at QPR.

But he will be hoping a good spell there, where he scored six goals in 17 appearances as he helped Harry Redknapp's side to promotion, will lead to more first-team opportunities this year.
