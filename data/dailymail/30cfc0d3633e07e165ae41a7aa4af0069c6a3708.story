With her toned physique and glowing skin, Dannii Minogue regularly tops lists of the world's sexiest women. And now the former X Factor judge has revealed her unusual beauty secret.

Dannii admitted that she rarely exercises - and instead uses her son Ethan as a means of working out.

Dannii explained on ITV1's Lorraine: 'I don't train or work out. I'm just 
lifting the baby - that's my weights workout.'

Dannii's secret to looking so good? She doesn't exercise but claims that lifting her son counts as a weights workout

The Australian star made it clear that following the birth of her son in 2010, she wasn't rushing to get back on the treadmill and instead wanted to spend time with her newborn.

But she has previously admitted to being a staunch fan of her trusty Power Plate machine. The vibrating device is claimed to 
intensify the effects of exercise, rapidly shedding fat and toning 
muscles – and Dannii is a firm believer in its benefits.

‘For me, it’s the quickest, easiest way to tone up and create a lean body,’ she told Hello magazine.

Miss Minogue also revealed her diet secrets on yesterday's show, saying she is a fan of a2 Milk, which claims to prevent bloating and digestive
problems because it is free of a troublesome strain of protein apparent
in normal milk.

Asked 
about how she looks after her body, the 40-year-old told viewers: ‘I do watch what I eat and I discovered this milk in Australia 
called a2.

‘It’s been a
huge success there and it’s coming over here, and for anyone who’s ever
drunk milk and has just got that yucky feeling; it just doesn’t agree 
with your body; it might upset your tummy…it’s amazing.

'And
obviously I’m conscious with little Ethan - you go for your health 
check-ups and they’re like, “Dairy, you’ve got to get it in”.’

A
spokesman for the brand admitted Miss Minogue, 41, is paid to represent
the brand, but insisted the star had already made clear she liked the 
product before being asked to publicly endorse it.  

Dannii also revealed that her baby son speaks several languages: 'He is talking a lot. He's very good with languages so my friends who speak different languages are speaking to him.

Diet secrets revealed: Dannii appeared on Lorraine's show yesterday morning

'From TV shows he's learning different languages - there's one with a bit of Spanish in, another one with Chinese in it so he's like, "Ni Hao"! And when my Italian friend speaks to him he says, "Ciao!" He's brilliant.'

Dannii also added she's excited to be involved with the 'Lorraine Little Black Dress Diet’ which launches on Monday 12 November.

She explained: 'It's going to be a lot of fun. It's not stressful, just tips and things - if they work for you and they're helpful, that's great. But I'm looking forward to the fitness - I don't do any fitness.'

Along with Tabitha Somerset Webb, the partner of her fashion label Project D, Dannii will be helping Lorraine viewers look fabulous for the Christmas party season with the ‘Lorraine Little Black Dress Diet’.
