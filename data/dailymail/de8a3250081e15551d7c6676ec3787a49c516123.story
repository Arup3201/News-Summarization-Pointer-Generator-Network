'Elderly and frail': Edith Stuart was unlawfully killed when her care home bed was set alight, a coroner ruled

A great-grandmother died after an unknown killer set fire to her bedding in a care home, an inquest found yesterday.

Coroner Simon Jones said it was a ‘disgrace’ that no one had been brought to justice for the unlawful killing of Edith Stuart, 96.

Yesterday, in extraordinary scenes at the inquest into her death, two former employees of the privately run home took the stand to deny being in non-smoker Mrs Stuart’s room at the time the blaze started.

But last night her family said they were devastated that her killer had not been caught and that she had been ‘murdered in her own bed’.

Her daughter Shirley Fish, 76, said: ‘We feel extremely let down that we have had no justice. Elderly people are in care homes as a place of safety.

‘Nobody expects them to be murdered in their own bed by arsonists.

‘We hope whoever committed this crime understands that they have to live with the consequences of their despicable act for the rest of their lives.

‘Whoever has done this obviously needs help and we just want them to come forward so that we can put this behind us.

‘This horrific thing that has happened has been like a cancer that spreads and I don’t think we will ever recover from it.’

'Discrepancies': The coroner noticed differences in the accounts given by care workers Charlene Clough (left) and Sophie Nolan (right)

The two care workers from Cleveleys Park Nursing Home in Fleetwood, Lancashire, had initially been arrested on suspicion of murder but no charges were ever brought.

Mrs Stuart, formerly of Burnley, had been living at the home for around four years when she was killed. She died in hospital the day after the fire on October 18 2010. The inquest heard care workers Charlene Clough, 28, and Sophie Nolan, 18, were the sole members of staff on duty to look after ten elderly residents, nine of whom were mentally or physically infirm.

The one mobile resident was upstairs in her room at the time of the fire, while police ruled out the involvement of an intruder.

West Lancashire coroner Mr Jones said he noticed ‘discrepancies’ in the care workers’ accounts of their whereabouts before the fire alarm went off.

But the Crown Prosecution Service ruled last March that there was insufficient evidence to charge either of the two women in connection with Mrs Stuart’s death.

Recording a verdict of unlawful killing at Fleetwood Magistrates’ Court, Mr Jones said: ‘I am entirely satisfied that the fire was started deliberately by a person or persons that the police were unable to identify.

‘It is hard to conceive a more dreadful act for someone to deliberately set fire to a bed in which an elderly and frail and relatively immobile lady is lying in the knowledge that the lady has limited possibility of escaping once the fire had been started and in doing so to bring about her death.’

He shared police regrets that they ‘have been unable to identify anyone responsible for this dreadful act which could have resulted in them being brought before a criminal court’.

Mr Jones said: ‘I offer my condolences to the family and I recognise the fact that this inquest has now concluded and that the family are left with the one question: Who is responsible for Mrs Stuart’s death?

‘I take some comfort that this is not a closed case. If any new evidence does come to light, it will be reconsidered.’

Home Office pathologist Dr Alison Armour confirmed the cause of Mrs Stuart’s death was 50 per cent burns and that she had been lying down when the fire spread to her bedding.

Richard Percival, of Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, said a cigarette lighter was found on Mrs Stuart’s bedroom floor, but she did not smoke. No DNA evidence could be obtained from it.

He said the pattern of the fire was not consistent with a dropped cigarette, and the flame would have had to be held for three seconds to start the blaze.

He concluded that it was ‘highly likely’ the fire had been started deliberately.
