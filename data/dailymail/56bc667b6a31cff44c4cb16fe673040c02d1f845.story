A father-of-two has been jailed after RSPCA officials discovered the maggot-infested bodies of his two dogs in a locked bedroom where they had been starved to death. 

Jamie Broadbent forced the animals into one of the rooms in his home in Burnley, Lancashire, after deciding he could not afford to feed them on the fortnightly £84-a-week benefits he received.

The 29-year-old ignored their scratches on the door and cries for attention, leaving their bodies to rot for more than a week.  

Dogs Cassie and Roxy were locked in a room at their owner's home and left to die. When RSPCA officials discovered them, their bodies had become maggot-infested

He was jailed for 12 weeks and banned from owning a pet for 10 years. 

Burnley Magistrates Court heard how Broadbent left a bag of dry dog food with German Shepherd Roxy and Cassie, a terrier, before removing the door handle used to access the room.

The unemployed father-of-two did not leave any water for the animals which died of dehydration. 

Scratches on the door and dirty marks on the window pane of the living room were indicators of the dogs' desperate attempts to survive, an RSPCA prosecutor told the court. 

'The German Shepherd was severely decomposed with a large number of maggots. He had been dead for at least 10 days.

'The Terrier had been dead for around seven days,' said Christopher Wyatt. 

'He said he could not afford to feed them, and that they perhaps died through a lack of water because he didn't give them enough.'

'It seems bizarre that after watching one dog die you would sit back and watch another die and if it was just a case of lack of water, he could have easily remedied that.'

Broadbent, who admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs, had displayed 'long' neglected the animals, said magistrates.  

'There was a long neglect resulting in the death of one dog followed by the death of a second dog and we feel you should have acted on the death of the first dog.

'There were signs of distress and scratches on the door. There were children sometimes in the house and you went to the trouble of taking the door handle off and you left knowing that the dogs were dead.

'We feel you could have acted, you could have let someone know. 

'You knew the outcome, you knew what you did was wrong when you caused unnecessary suffering to both dogs.'
