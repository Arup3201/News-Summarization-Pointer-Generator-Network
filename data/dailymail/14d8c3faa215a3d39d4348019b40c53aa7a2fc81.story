Energy firms have held on to more than £400million belonging to customers who have closed their accounts, it emerged today.

The Big Six suppliers have now been ordered to do more to return the cash to 3.5million families and 300,000 businesses.

Consumer groups condemned the ‘appalling’ behaviour by gas and electricity companies.

More than 3.5million households and 300,000 businesses are owed more than £400million from closed accounts

Energy watchdog Ofgem said the industry had not done enough to pay back money built up by customers paying by direct debit.

When they move house or switch supplier, money left in their account has not been returned by British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power, Npower, EDF and Eon.

According to Ofgem the biggest firms hold £202million built up in household bills and £204million from non-domestic customers.

The crackdown comes after a surge in customers switching firms to find better deals without realising they were owed money by their old supplier.

Ofgem boss Andrew Wright said: ‘When many people are struggling to make ends meet, it is vital that energy companies do the right thing and do all they can to return this money and restore consumer trust.

Ofgem's Andrew Wright called on energy firms to 'do the wright thing' and return the money

‘We want to see decisive action by suppliers, individually and collectively, to address this issue and, wherever possible, to ensure that the balances they currently hold are returned to consumers.’

He added that where the money cannot be returned it should be used to benefit consumers more generally.

Ofgem found wide variation in the way companies dealt with the money, and how easy it was for customers to get it back.

Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy said: ‘It's appalling that firms have been sitting on hundreds of millions of pounds of customers' money, making little effort to return it. Hard-pressed households who are struggling to get by and businesses feeling the pressure on their finances would benefit from the money being in their pockets not their energy company's bank account.

‘Suppliers do not hold the purse strings of households in this country. If they have people's money they should return it as soon as possible.’

Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director, said:  ‘If true, it's shocking that some of the biggest energy companies are sitting on millions of pounds worth of consumers' cash.

‘Suppliers must return this money as soon as possible and be clear about what customers need to do when they close accounts.’

Ofgem has told the Big Six to do more to reunite individual customers with their money, tell people how the money is being used and improve communication to prevent it happening again.

British Gas alone held £40million in closed accounts, but the company insisted that the company was owed £200million by customers.

Ian Peters, managing director of residential energy, said: “British Gas will always provide a full and immediate refund to customers for any sum owing to them, whenever we can contact them. 

‘Even if they are owed as little as a pound, we will always give them their money back, no matter how long ago they left us.’

 Since 2012, British Gas has sent more than 32,000 letters, made 18,000 outbound calls and received over 16,000 calls, successfully returning money to 10,000 customers, he added.
