Who says pensioners have to wear slacks and flatcaps?

A new photo series show senior citizens in ghetto gear - and they look fabulous.

An array of elderly male and female models are seen rocking hoodies and baseball tops, pulling hip hop signs more suited to East Coast rappers.

Photographer Ryan Edy, 25, took the pictures in junction with independent clothes shop Capology and NE LOVE Magazine.Â 

'The models where dubious when we first pitched the concept to them as they were, quite naturally, out of their comfort zone,' said Ryan, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

'The first few frames where tense, but the models soon warmed to the idea and by the end were really getting into the zone and having fun.'

Ryan admits that the shoot is in stark contrast to the independent shop's usual demographic.

'We wanted to create striking and powerful images that were a bit tongue-in-cheek.

'The response has been amazing, more than we ever could have imagined. It's been a healthy mixture of skeptical and very positive.'

When asked if older people can generally get away with donning trendy gear, Ryan responded: 'Of course, in this day and age, everyone has their own personality and style which is often portrayed in their choice of clothing.'
