Take That fans can party in singer Gary Barlow's former home now that the £7.5 million mansion has been transformed into a wedding venue.

The sprawling six-bedroom Delamere Manor, surrounded by 100 acres of Cheshire countryside, is the ultimate millionaire's pad with a lake and its own disco ball-swinging nightclub.

It was put on the market by the 44-year-old father-of-four in 2011 for the guide price of £7,250,000 and was snapped up by local businesswoman Michelle Stubbs.

The superstar even whisked former lawyer Michelle off to a Take That concert, in Dublin, to seal the deal.

Now Michelle hopes Take That fans will see it as the ultimate spot to tie the knot - by launching it as a premium wedding and private hire venue.

Stunning Delamere Manor has only had a few owners since the famous Wilbraham family bought it in the 1700s.

The Wilbraham's were the major landowners in Cheshire for centuries, spawning generations of politicians and innovative businessmen.

Former X Factor judge Gary, whose mum is from Liverpool, spent ten years at the manor house, reportedly designing it in the style of Elton John's mansion.

It has six, giant master bedrooms, three huge reception rooms, manicured gardens, a Victorian pump house and a six-acre lake. 

The luxury estate can host weddings parties from 50 to 300 guests and will be available for exclusive hire for brides looking for "the perfect English wedding day".

Michelle, who has since redecorated with its next use in mind, will also hire out its nightclub for special parties.
