While most of their team-mates are away on international duty, the likes of Mario Balotelli, Kolo Toure and Adam Lallana are being put through their paces at Liverpool's Melwood training ground.

The trio were part of the Reds squad who took part in training on Wednesday as they gear up for their next fixture at home to Aston Villa in the Premier League on September 13.

Balotelli appears to have settled in quickly at the Merseyside club following his £16million move from AC Milan in August.

'These are the best fans in the world and traditionally they always get behind our strikers. I've told him it's there for him.

'If he plays well and works hard for these supporters, they'll get behind him. He won't have experienced support like that he's about to get.

'He's a big, strong lad. He held it up terrifically well. All eyes were on him today and I thought he was a terrific team player. He did a lot of ugly work for the team and showed some really good touches.

'You've got to remember that he's only had three lots of 45 minutes in pre-season, so with game time and getting used to the manager and players around him, he's going to be a terrific player for us.'
