Jobless under-25s will be banned from claiming benefits under plans being considered by the Labour party.

All young people would be barred from receiving Employment Support Allowance and Income Support, and only those from low income families would receive a new ‘youth allowance’ to help them find work.

Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, is examining the plan drawn up by a left-leaning think tank to counter claims the party is soft on welfare.

Tough: Rachel Reeves has vowed to tackle Labour's image as being soft on welfare since becoming shadow work and pensions secretary in last month's reshuffle

The Institute for Public Policy Research is expected to set out its proposals for a means-tested youth allowance for 18 to 24-year-olds who are not in work or education this week.

Youngsters with parents who earn more than £25,000 will not be eligible.

Under-25s would only be able to claim the allowance if they are in ‘purposeful’ training or can prove they are ‘intensively’ looking for work, according to IPPR.

Speech: Labour leader Ed Miliband told his party conference that school leavers should not face end up in a life on benefits

Under the plan the youth allowance would be set at £56.80 in line with Jobseekers’ Allowance for over-25s.

But
under-25s would not be allowed to claim Employment Support Allowance 
and Income Support, potentially saving the taxpayer £1.3 billion-a-year.

Ms Reeves has vowed to tackle Labour's image as being soft on welfare since becoming shadow work and pensions secretary in last month's reshuffle.

Labour leader Ed Miliband signalled a tougher approach in September, when he told his party conference: ‘If the school system fails our young people they shouldn’t be ending up on benefits.

‘They should be ending up in education or training so they can get back on the road to a proper career.’

A week later David Cameron called for under-25s to lose the right to claim the dole.

The Prime Minister used his conference speech to reveal the next Conservative manifesto is likely to promise to withdraw benefits for school leavers so that they can no longer 'opt for a life on benefits'.

It is estimated that more than 1million people could be affected, including more than 360,000 aged 18-25 claiming Jobseeker's Allowance last month.

Removing housing benefit from under-25s is estimated to save the Treasury £2billion.

Research by the IPPR found that countries like the Netherlands and Denmark that block young people from claiming conventional benefits also have lower rates of youth unemployment. In Denmark just 7 per cent are of young people are not in training or employment, in Netherlans just four per cent but in the UK the figure is 14 per cent.

Despite the economic recovery taking hold, there are still almost 1million under-25s who are out of work

Graeme Cooke, from the IPPR, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Gaining decent qualifications and practical work experience are the two most important things affecting young people’s job prospects.

‘Yet the current welfare system prevents young people from continuing to study and permits them to spend unlimited periods on benefits without work.’

Labour insiders admit the party is stung by Tory claims of being the party of welfare.

Sources today said the party would wait until the IPPR report had been published before making a decision.
