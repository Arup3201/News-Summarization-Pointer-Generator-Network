For the inhabitants of Middle Earth, it was a popular watering hole, where Frodo Baggins and his friends Sam, Merry and Pippin liked to tipple.

But now the famous shire inn in the village of Hobbiton has expanded its visitors from curious Hobbits and opened up to the public.

Tourists and nearby residents can now enjoy a beverage or two at The Green Dragon pub in Hobbiton, near Matamata in the North Island of New Zealand.

Frodo Baggins regularly visited the inn and shared many a beer with friends in the Lord of The Rings trilogy.

The local was used in Peter Jackson's films 10-years-ago but was burned to the ground as part of the third film Return of The
King.

However it was rebuilt for the upcoming film series, starting with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,  along with 44 'Hobbit holes' to recreate the iconic village in the shire.

The pub was impressive because it was built with a functioning fireplace, plumbing and water pipes.

The
inn is the latest addition to the Hobbiton tourist attraction that offers film fanatics the chance to see part of the film set.

Located
 in the tourist village of Hobbiton - a town built in 1998 that has been open to the 
public since 2002 â€” the new pub is intended to make the visiting 
experiences all the more Hobbit-like.

The Green Dragon was one of many inns of the shire. In the books it was located in Bywater on the Bywater Road and was the building nearest to Hobbiton, situated one mile southeast from the bridge over he water that led to Bag End.

When Bilbo Baggins looked at the letter that Thorin Oakenshield had left on his mantelpiece after the Unexpected Party, he found that he only had ten minutes to arrive punctually for the 11am start of the quest to the Lonely Mountain at the Green Dragon Inn.

Bilbo made it, barely, and found that the Thorin and company were packed and ready to go.

You can search far an wide
you can drink the whole town dry
but you'll never find a beer so brown
but you'll never find a beer so brown
as the one we drink in our home town
as the one we drink in our home town
you can drink your fancy ales
you can drink em by the flagon
but the only brew for the brave and true...
comes from the green dragon

Hobbiton manager Russell Alexander said he estimated the release of the new Hobbit film would help bring in 100,000 visitors over the next 12 months.

The site, which recently
celebrated its tenth anniversary, has been visited by an estimated 300,000
people over the past decade.

The Green Dragon in the village was officially opened on November 29th last month by New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key.

The pub offers exclusive drinks on tap including two beers, a cider and ginger beer and
features original looking interiors.

According to the
pub's Facebook page it is 'a place to drink, a place to meet, a place to
rest your hairy feet'.

It features the characteristic circular doors made famous in the films.

Hobbiton Board director and former Tourism New Zealand boss George Hickton said that in future it may be possible to convert the facility to allow for overnight stays.

In the Hobbit, the inn was frequented by Hobbits from both Bywater and the neighbouring settlement of Hobbiton.

Meanwhile, as Hobbit-mania spreads from New Zealand to across the globe, one mother demonstrated her devotion to the films.

Maddie Chambers, 33, spent 11 months creating a miniature dolls house of the Hobbit hole.

She painstakingly handcrafted the grassy verges, flowers and furniture and created a near replica - only much smaller.

It measures approximately 3ft long by 1.5ft wide - has lights that turn on and a chandelier fit for royalty.

Ms Chambers, an IT support engineer, fashioned the model using MDF, chicken wire, plaster, paint and glue.

Each room and the outside has been made with distinctive detail, including a fireplace made out of stone, a briefcase, cabbage patch and several ornate bookshelves.

The mother-of-two, from Chesterfield, said: 'I took a childcare course at college when my twin boys were babies and in one of the modules, we had to make a toy.

'I have always loved Lord of the rings and the idea came from there.

'It took just under a year working on it two hours a night when I wasn't looking after my sons.

'I designed a frame with the essential rooms, made it out of MDF and then covered the whole thing in chicken wire modelled to look like the hill. I then covered it in plaster and paint and scenic grass.'

She added: 'Inside I decorated as you would a normal house except in miniature.

'The support from around the world has been amazing.'

The hobbit house now lives in Australia with the Proudfoot Foundation, which supports children's literacy and is available to hire out to raise funds for the very good cause.
