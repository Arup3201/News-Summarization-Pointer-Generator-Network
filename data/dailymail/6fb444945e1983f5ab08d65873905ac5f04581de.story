Dressed in seductive corsets, fishnet tights and glittering heels, they enticed audiences at burlesque theaters with strip shows.

And decades on, these former burlesque dancers - some of whom are aged over 90 - have shown they can still draw attention and strike a pose.

The pensioners, who were successful performers in their heyday, were photographed by Marie Baronnet for her book, Legends: The Living Art of Risqué.

While some are pictured flashing their flesh in sensual bodices, others are seen donning less revealing, but just as glamorous, gowns and jackets.

Glamorous: Stephanie Blake, who was a successful performers in her heyday, poses on her bed in a glamorous green outfit and gloves

Born performer: While some of the women are seen flashing their flesh, others are donning less revealing, but just as glamorous, costumes. Above, Bambi Jones is pictured posing outside her home in Henderson, Nevada, in 2012, donning a skimpy pink outfit

And one particularly brave woman is captured wearing only black underwear and leopard-print heels (with a pair of sunglasses completing her look).

Speaking to CNN,  Ms Baronnet said that despite all being over the age of 65, the women are 'very self-sufficient', with a wealth of knowledge.

'I really enjoyed being around those women,' she told the news station. 'I found that they had a real knowledge of life but also of this work.

'We would put on the costumes and makeup, we'd do the hair and the lights, and then suddenly they would just know how to move.'

The LA-based photographer described the pensioners as charismatic, rhythmic and artistic - three things that she said are vital for burlesque dancing.

'They have to have personality and rhythm, they have to know how to dance, and they have to be an artist because they have to do all those costumes and create a choreography,' she said, explaining how stripteases empowered many women in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, often enabling them to travel abroad.

'Legends': 'We would put on the costumes and makeup, we'd do the hair and the lights, and then suddenly they would just know how to move'. Above, a former burlesque dancer named Wild Cherry is pictured sprawled across her bed at her New Orleans home

But while the women thrived off enticing audiences with glamorous, feathery outfits during these decades, they were soon asked to bare more flesh.

They were told by their bosses to throw away their outfits and 'show more' amid an influx of strip clubs across the US in the 80s, Ms Baronnet said.

The transition, she told CNN, was extremely difficult for many of the performers, some of whom were in their later forties and early fifties by this point. 

It caused some retire from their beloved profession.

Animal lover: Ms Baronnet, who became interested in burlesque after meeting dancer and stripper Dixie Evans in Las Vegas in 2011 (two years before 'The Marilyn Monroe of Burlesque' died), captured the pensioners in their own homes. Above, Suzette Fontaine

Athletic: She also gathered quotes from the ex-dancers, some of whom have names like Eartha Quake and Monique Marlow (pictured)

'Dominant': Ms Baronnet describes the pensioners online as 'dominating characters of the quintessential American art of strip tease'. Above, Lottie the Body from Detroit is pictured posing on the purple sheets of her bed in 2012, while donning a skimpy gold outfit

Ms Baronnet, who grew fascinated with burlesque after meeting dancer and stripper Dixie Evans in Las Vegas in 2011 (two years before 'The Marilyn Monroe of Burlesque' passed away at the age of 86), captured the pensioners in their own homes, situated in various cities across the country.

She also gathered quotes from the former dancers, some of whom have names like Eartha Quake, Bambi Jones, Isis Starr and Velvet Ice.

In an online description of her book, Ms Baronnet describes the women as 'dominating characters of the quintessential American art of strip tease'.
