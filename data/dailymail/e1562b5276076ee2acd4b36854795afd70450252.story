NBC News anchor Brian Williams returns to screens next Tuesday, having been away since undergoing knee replacement surgery on Aug. 6.

The network said on Thursday that Willliams will be back to work at 'Nightly News' after Labor Day.

NBC has the top-rated evening news program, but ABC's 'World News' with Diane Sawyer has been creeping closer. Lester Holt has been filling in for Williams since his surgery.

On the road to recovery: Brian Williams returns the screens next weeks after knee replacement surgery

Williams discussed the knee replacement surgery Thursday in a Nightly News segment about the procedure by Dr. Nancy Snyderman.

'If you don't see me around here for a while, this is the reason why,' he said, describing the 'helmet to the knee' injury he suffered playing high school football.

'I have been in pain for 35 years,' said Williams. 'I have paid a very high price from what's been confirmed to be the single worst New Jersey high school Catholic League football career in history,' he joked.

Williams, 54, said he's had three previous surgeries on his right knee but the pain was becoming more of an issue. When it began costing him sleep, Williams said he realized it was time to take care of it.

Bone-on-bone: Williams had been in agony for 35 years with his knee, which has lost all its cartilage meaning there was no cushioning between his bones. Surgery replaced it with an artificial joint

'If this doesn't go perfectly, it can't hurt any more than it does now,' he said.

Snyderman said most people who have knee replacement surgery miss between three weeks and three months of work, depending on the physical nature of their jobs.

Full recovery takes between six months and a year.

Williams joked during an appearance on David Letterman's Late Show last month that 'I want to come back almost a little too early gooned on medication. I think it will be great viewing.'

Long considered one of America’s favorite news anchors, Williams' skills as a hip hop MC were revealed by ‘Late Night’ host Jimmy Fallon recently.

Back in June, Fallon featured Williams hitting up some 90s West Coast flavor with a mash-up of Warren G’s 'Regulate' and Dr Dre's 'Nuthin but a 'G' Thang', then earlier this month it was time for Brian to get old skool (sic) with a blast of Young MC’s classic 80s cut ‘Bust A Move.’

The hilarious footage was created by splicing together Williams' words from countless news broadcasts to create an almost seamless mash-up of the first and second verses of the 1989 classic all about the age-old story of boys trying to impress the ladies.
