The former girlfriend of comedian Frank Skinner, radio presenter Caroline Feraday, has blasted the BBC after she was axed by the Corporation by text message.

Her show on BBC London 94.9 was cancelled overnight as part of cost-cutting measures.

Although the presenter was in the running for a new show, she was told by SMS that she had lost out instead of being informed in person by BBC bosses.

Feraday, 35, told the Evening 
Standard that BBC staff felt 'frustrated and demoralised' by the BBC's 
cost-cutting programme Delivering Quality First, which she described as a
'euphemism for giving people the elbow.'

She
continued: 'I was told [about missing out on a new role] by text on a 
Sunday night. I was told to give them a call which I did and they never 
returned my call.'

The spat is the latest in a line of clashes between the BBC and its radio talent.

Former Radio One breakfast presenter, Chris Moyles, 38, subjected listeners to a tirade in 2010 during which he claimed the BBC hadn't paid him for two months.

More recently, BBC London DJ Danny Baker blasted the BBC in a two-hour on-air rant after the Corporation axed his show.

Before dramatically quitting at the end 
of his lengthy diatribe, the presenter found time to describe bosses as 
'pinheaded weasels' and noted that everyone at the station 'plainly 
hates each other.'

Feraday, who also counts Strictly Come Dancing's Anton du Beke among her ex-boyfriends, was told her show was axed at the same time as Baker's but wasn't after protests from listeners, was not sure it would definitely be cancelled.

She added: 'It's not about me. I'll be alright. It's the nature of the business and I'll get another gig.

'But a lot of people who listen to the show are perhaps housebound or isolated and they are the people the BBC should be working for as licence fee payers.'

When her allegations were put to the BBC, a spokesman responded: 'We appreciate Caroline and BBC London listeners may be disappointed.

'However changes to the schedule are a result of the BBC's savings programme agreed with the BBC Trust and have been planned for some time.

'There has been extensive communication to staff. The editor met with Caroline to discuss the changes.'
