It is a town which has struggled with its image for many years.

Previous 'awards' for Luton include being voted the 'dirtiest town in Britain' and the 'worst place to live in the UK'.

And if these pictures are anything to go by, it looks like the town is still struggling to shake off its poor reputation.

Concerned with Luton's image, a local photographer,  who did not 
want to be named, wandered the streets of the Bedfordshire town and took
 this disturbing series of images.

With large groups of rats pictured 
eating on discarded food, cars left with shattered windows following 
break-ins by thieves and 
litter left lying on the streets, it paints a grim picture of the town.

But it seems his concerns about the town may well fall on deaf ears.

Michael Garrett, the leader of the 
Conservative group on Luton Borough Council, defended the town and said 
it does not have a problem with street cleaning and refuse collection.

'Yes, the town has got problems but I cannot agree that it is a dirty mess,' he said. 'I cannot agree with that at all.

'The government has made local government cuts and Luton, as with other places, has had to cope with that.

'In
 terms of street cleaning, I have not noticed that it has gone downhill.
 Parts of the town are run down but that is not really a fault of the 
council. It is doing its best under difficult circumstances.

'I
 would not say that refuse collection and street cleaning has suffered 
in any way. With less staff they are still managing to keep the streets 
tidy. For years Luton has suffered with this bad image but I do not 
think it deserves it.'

With all councils across the country 
facing cuts in central government grants, the images reflect the 
challenges faced by towns across Britain as they struggle not to slide 
into neglect.

The concerns about rubbish in Luton 
follow the decision by the borough council to approve cuts to street 
cleaning services last year.

Luton is best known for its airport, football club and carnival - the largest of its kind in Europe.

The town, which has a population of around 255,000, has long been proud of its football team, which currently plays in the Conference National division.

Its history includes a number of spells in the top flight of English football. In 1988, Luton Town won the Football League cup.

One of the biggest employers in the town and a huge source of visitors is London Luton Airport, which opened in 1938 and is one of England's major airports.

Also based in the town is the University of Bedfordshire, attracting students to the area.

One of the most popular events of the year in the town is the Luton Carnival which is held on the final May bank holiday. It is the largest one-day carnival in Europe.

The cutbacks, which the council said would save £262,000 a year, resulted in the loss of 12 jobs from the council's street cleaning team.

The
 cuts also resulted in a sharp decline in the number of streets with an 
'acceptable level of cleanliness', with a decline from 97 per cent to 
87.5 per cent.

Cleaning was
 not reduced in the town centre and other busy shopping areas, but the 
response time of the graffiti removal service was increased to two days 
from one, except in cases of racially-motivated or offensive graffiti.

Speaking after the cuts decision last year, Lib Dem group leader David Franks criticised the decision.

He said: 'The big issue is that they chopped £100,000 out of the budget last year and £34,000 the year before.

'They clearly believe that this is
 not making any difference, but I’m getting people saying to me that 
there is more litter, more fly posting.

'Are we going to go back to 2002 when Luton was voted the dirtiest town in Britain?'

Staff expressed concerns that blood spillages and graffiti would not be cleaned up at weekends during a consultation on the cuts.

Borough council spokesman Chris Hall today defended its record for cleaning.

He said: 'We believe the recent demolition of a multi-storey car park disturbed some rats but there is no evidence to suggest the population is any greater in Luton than in other towns and cities across the country.

'The number of reports of rats and requests for treatment received by the council has actually fallen by around 30 per cent from 886 in 2008/9 to 618 in 2011/12.

'We put this down to proactive baiting, integrated pest management (treating an area rather than individual properties) and working with home owners and landlords to educate about pest proofing measures.

'It should be noted that the council’s standards of street cleansing have improved in each of the last seven years and last year 98 per cent of streets were rated good or satisfactory, placing our borough in the top ten per cent in the UK.

'We are also ranked in the top 30 per cent of councils nationwide for taking action against illegal fly-tipping, and the number of incidents has decreased steeply over the last two years - from 3,394 in 2011/12 to 2,134 so far this year.

'Luton council continues to provide an in-house pest control team that carries out proactive and covert baiting in areas that rats are attracted to in the town centre.

'We also provide a free service to home owners in the borough experiencing any public health pest problem which means they can get a rat problem dealt with at no expense to themselves and helps keep vermin levels to a minimum.'

Councillors criticised the cutbacks, saying that they feared the standard of cleanliness will slip further
