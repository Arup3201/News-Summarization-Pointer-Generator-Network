He's the unremarkable Liberal MP who pulled the trigger on next week's leadership crisis, which could see Prime Minister Tony Abbott out of a job. 

West Australian backbencher Luke Simpkins this afternoon  emailed his colleagues, announcing he had submitted a motion to spill the Liberal leadership. 

'The Knighthood issue was for many the final proof of a disconnection with the people,' Mr Simpkins said. 'I think we must bring this to a head and test the support of the leadership in the party room.'

But prior to today's dramatic announcement - Mr Simpkins has rarely been a figure in national headlines. 

The former Army officer perhaps drew the most attention when Daily Mail Australia exclusively revealed he had publicly confused a nightclub logo on stickers in Perth for Islamic State flags.

Seat of power: Liberal backbencher Luke Simpkins has moved a motion for a Federal Liberal leadership spill

The Shahada flag: It features a common Islamic expression but has been co-opted by jihadists

The nightclub logo: The Speakeasy logo also features white cursive writing, but is written in English

Mr Simpkins asked the Transport Department to paint over the symbols - which were actually the logo for local club night Speakeasy.

'It's definitely nothing to do with Islamic Anything,' event manager Pierce Ericson told Daily Mail Australia at the time.

The black Shahada flag is a common expression of Islamic faith but has been co-opted by jihadists. The Speakeasy flag featured white, cursive handwriting on a black background.

Mr Simpkins did not comment after the matter was revealed, but he removed the post from his Facebook page after online mockery.  

Mr Simpkins' seat - which covers Perth's northern suburbs - is marginal and has been in both Labor and Liberal hands over the past decades.

He increased his vote at the 2013 federal election but could be at risk if lugged with an unpopular party leader, as recent polls indicate Mr Abbott has been. 

He told Sky News today he expected Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull will stand.

That's Major Simpkins to you! Luke Simpkins has a record of distinguished service in the country's armed forces

In Parliament since 2007: Backbencher Luke Simpkins told his colleagues today he was not coveting the leadership

He said Mr Morrison and Ms Bishop have 'got a proven track record'. 

'The reality is, people have stopped listening to the Prime Minister,' he said. 

A former Army Major, Mr Simpkins is quite vocal on terrorism-related issues. Last year, Mr Simpkins spoke about Australian militants embracing the Islamic State terror group under the Shahada flag in a speech to Federal Parliament. 

'These people make a personal decision to betray their country and follow the black flag of Shahada and the Islamic State,' he said.  

He is also reportedly passionate about human rights abuses in Myanmar, recently illegally crossing the border from Thailand to attend a military parade, according to reports.  

Mr Simpkins' media releases indicate he is committed to ensuring his local community receives Federal funding, hailing the diversion of funds for roads and schools in his electorate. 

He has touted his commitment to crime prevention and local volunteering programs. 

Prior to his time in parliament, he was a successful sportsman, having represented his country and Western Australia in the sport of rowing, winning two national and six state championships, according to his official biography.
