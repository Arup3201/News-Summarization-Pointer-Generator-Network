A Florida woman is facing child abuse charges after she hit the brakes 'while going 10mph' because her children were bickering.

Lorena Sullivan Simpson, 43, from Port St Lucie, was trying to stop her nine-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter from fighting in the back seat when she put the car to a stop near their home.

Her 12-year-old daughter was sitting in the front seat not wearing a seat belt and slammed her head into the windshield. 

Port St Lucie mother Lorena Sullivan Simpson, 43, slammed on the brakes when her children in the backseat were fighting and her daughter, 12, hit the windshield

Mrs Sullivan Simpsons said the girl was leaning forward and not wearing a seat belt before she left a crack on the glass

Department of Children and Families arrived at Mrs Sullivan Simpson's home three days later. 

She was arrested, but claims she never harmed her daughter on purpose and didn't know she wasn't wearing a seat belt.

Police say that the windshield was cracked and the girl complained of dizziness and headaches, but was not taken to the doctor by her mother.

'There was no bump, so I'm sorry but I guess I did the wrong thing,' said Mrs Sullivan Simpson, who is out on bond, told WPBF.

She said that she was travelling at 10mph and her daughter was bending down texting when she was jolted forward and her ponytail hit the windshield.

The children are now with their father in Kentucky.

Third degree felony charges in Florida can carry up to five years in prison upon conviction.

The mother said that her daughter, who later complained of dizziness, was leaning down and texting before she was jolted forward because of the sudden stop
