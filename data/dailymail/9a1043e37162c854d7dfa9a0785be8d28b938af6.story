A win is a win, and Scotland will take it, but they were pretty lucky to emerge victorious from their  second game on the tour.

Scotland didn’t play well and received a huge helping hand from the referee when he sent off a  Canadian player near the end.

This was a huge call because  Canada had earned a penalty right in front of the posts, a certain three points, which would have taken them into the lead with only five minutes remaining.

Seeing red: Scotlland were fortunate that the referee sent off Canada's Jebb Sinclair towards the end

The referee had spotted a  potential issue with how Canadian flanker Jebb Sinclair had carried the ball into, and through, Ruaridh Jackson and asked for the TMO to show the incident. The official  interpreted what he saw as leading with the elbow into the head and gave Sinclair a red card.

It was a shocking decision because, quite frankly, it was not even a  penalty. If that is a red-card offence, we would see matches finishing seven against seven because it  happens all the time. I think the referee was influenced by his arm moving forward after the contact was made, and everything looks worse in slow motion.

We will never know how Scotland would have reacted to going a point down with less than five minutes remaining, but the signs prior were not too promising.

To be fair, each time Scotland  conceded points, they immediately went down the other end and scored themselves — so who knows? They might have got themselves out of jail.

The win was just about the only positive to come out of the game. There were too many mistakes which just gave possession back to Canada, the set piece was not nearly as dominant as against the USA the week before and, at times, the defence was shocking.

Let off! Scotland were guilty of making too many mistakes against Canada and should have been punished

Concern: Vern Cotter will be troubled by the number of times Scotland's backline was breached by Canada

On a number of occasions, the defensive line was breached which resulted in the Canada try and could have led to others. This is the aspect of the performance that will trouble Vern Cotter the most. On this tour, it was always going to be difficult to change things in attack, with the new coach coming in and not many sessions to work on any new patters.

It does take time and repetition to embed a new attacking system or style of game and this is for next season. But the defensive system has not changed and defence coach Matt Taylor will be very  disappointed with the defensive performance.

The line speed was not as good as it had been the week before and there were too many one-on-one tackles missed which allowed the line breaks. It wasn’t a system issue so the individual players will have to take responsibility, with the video session not making for pleasant watching.It was a lethargic performance all round by Scotland both in attack and defence. The intensity that needs to be there for every game was just not there. It does not take too much of a drop-off in each player to deliver a poor collective performance, and it might have been because it was the last game for many after a long, bruising season.

Injury blow: Scotland flanker Alasdair Strokosch is stretchered off injured in Toronto, Canada

Individual handling errors meant that Scotland did not get to go through the phases and build  pressure on the Canadian defence at any time in the game. This is key when you play against a side like Canada. They have good shape for a few phases and like the big hits but begin to lose the shape when you get into multi-phase play.

This tour was always going to be an exercise of evaluation for Vern Cotter to assess what he has to work with, but one thing to concern him will be the injuries that are mounting up. Already out for the autumn Tests are Matt Scott, Ryan Grant and Ryan Wilson with  long-term injuries, so he will be  hoping he gets better luck in the two remaining matches when it comes to the casualty list.

It is good to analyse a  performance and be critical from a winning position. No one will be  kidding themselves about the  quality of the performance and the whole squad will know that they will really have to improve if they are to keep this winning tour going. The cavalry is on its way to Argentina, where a number of the Glasgow players will join the squad, which should help with confidence and improvement in performance.
