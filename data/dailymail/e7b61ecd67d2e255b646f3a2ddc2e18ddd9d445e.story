Serial sex attacker: Antoni Imiela was jailed for 12 years for raping Sheila Jankowitz in the early hours of Christmas Day 1987

One of Britain’s most notorious sex attackers was convicted yesterday of raping a woman on Christmas Day a quarter of a century ago.

Antoni Imiela, 57, attacked his victim in a London street as she searched for her husband after a row.The violent rapist and armed robber was told he is unlikely to be released from prison until he is too frail to pose a threat to women.

He is already serving seven life  sentences for a string of horrific sex attacks that led to him being dubbed the M25 rapist.

Advances in forensic technology enabled cold-case detectives to identify a minute trace of DNA that Imiela left at the scene of the 1987 attack.

Police were shocked that the sex predator could theoretically have applied for parole earlier this month, just eight years after he was jailed.

The case revealed that his appalling history of sexual violence began 14 years earlier than they originally suspected.

Detectives believe he could be responsible for dozens more offences and appealed for other victims to break their silence.

Judge John Bevan QC said the minimum sentence for Imiela’s other crimes would never have been set so low if the 1987 rape had been known.

Rapist: Antoni Imiela appears in court accused of attacking Sheila Jankowitz. As he was jailed today, the judge says he is 'wholly unrepentant'

Jailing him for 12 years at the Old 
Bailey, he said the rapist had never expressed remorse and treated his 
victim with ‘contempt and violence’.

The judge said: ‘I disagree with the suggestion you hate women. You seem to me to have a dislike of humanity in general.

‘Despite
you serving eight years of your life sentence you have not expressed 
one jot of remorse or repentance. You remain as dangerous as you clearly
were in 2004.

‘In my 
judgment you will, unless you show a change of attitude that would 
require courage you do not possess, remain a danger to the public until 
you are infirm.’

'Dislike of humanity': Serial rapist Antoni Imiela who was locked up for a further 12 years

Imiela, of
Ashford, Kent, was convicted of raping 29-year-old mother-of-two Sheila
Jankowitz as she left her flat in Sydenham, South East London, in the 
early hours of Christmas Day in 1987.

The
case was unusual because Mrs Jankowitz was murdered in South Africa in 
2006 and her only evidence came from a written statement.

Instead
her husband and daughter, who remain deeply traumatised by the attack, 
were forced to relive the ordeal in the witness box.

Mrs
Jankowitz was dragged on to waste ground behind the block of flats 
where she lived with her family, punched, threatened with a brick and 
subjected to an appalling attack.

Forensic
tests revealed the likelihood of a sample of bodily fluids found on the
victim coming from someone other than Imiela was ‘one in a billion’.

Imiela
was labelled the M25 rapist after snatching women and girls off the 
street in several Home Counties before using the motorway as a  getaway 
route.

Sex attacker: Imiela tried to rebuild his life after being released from prison in the 1990s

Antoni Imiela’s merciless attack on Sheila Jankowitz was the precursor to a series of violent stranger rapes that he committed more than a decade later.

The Old Bailey heard that he knew he was facing a lengthy jail sentence for armed robbery when he pounced on Mrs Jankowitz in the early hours of Christmas Day 1987.

Two weeks later he handed himself in to police for the robbery spree and was eventually jailed for 14 years.

He was released in 1996, and five years later began a terrifying campaign of rapes across the south of England on victims as young as 10. Imiela was dubbed 'the M25 rapist'.

He would snatch his victims where they were walking, drag them into a secluded area and rape them - exactly what he had done to Mrs Jankowitz more than a decade before.

Born in Lubeck, West Germany, in 1954 to a Polish father, a soldier, and German mother, Imiela spent part of his early childhood in a displaced people’s camp as his parents were both refugees.

The family moved to the UK in 1961 and spent time in Worthing, West Sussex, before eventually settling in the north east.

But his life spiralled out of control and he was first sent to Borstal at the age of 15 when he was locked up for robbery.

He had a child but his relationship with his partner came to a turbulent end in the mid 1980s.

In February 1987, after Imiela lost his job as a plasterer, he began his series of armed robberies across the country before he raped Sheila Jankowitz.

After his release from prison in 1996, he tried to build a new life in the south of England with another woman.

Christine, who was just recovering from a turbulent relationship with another man, married Imiela in 1997 and the couple moved into an old council house in the village of Appledore in Kent.

Imiela tried a string of odd jobs, including running a 'bric-a-brac' stall in nearby Rye, East Sussex, before finding work on the railways.

Colleagues recalled that he would brag to them about his use of prostitutes - although it later emerged that some of the stories might actually have been about rape victims.

One colleague said that shortly before Imiela’s arrest for the seven rapes, he saw him at St Pancras railway station in London, where he boasted that he 'went with this young girl and she looked only about 12'.

A few days earlier, Imiela had driven to Birmingham and kidnapped a 10-year-old girl at knifepoint before putting her through a five-hour sex ordeal in his car.

He also suggested to another colleague - who had no idea his fellow railway worker was the rapist - that the little girl might have 'deserved it'.
