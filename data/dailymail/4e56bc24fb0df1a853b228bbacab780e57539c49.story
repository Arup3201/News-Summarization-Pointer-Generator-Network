Jailed: Zain Khan, 21, was jailed for seven and a half years at Bradford Crown Court for for killing schoolboy Bilal Khazir as he fled from police at almost twice the legal speed limit

A hit-and-run driver who mowed down and killed a 12-year-old boy as he sped away from police at 'truly enormous speeds' was today jailed for seven and a half years.

Bilal Khazir was killed instantly when the high-performance car crashed into him as he crossed a main road in Bradford on his scooter, throwing the schoolboy more than 50 metres along the road.

Uninsured driver Zain Khan, 21, was travelling at more than twice the 40mph speed limit in his 'very powerful' car, Bradford Crown Court heard.

Khan sped away from the scene in his badly-damaged vehicle, leaving police in his wake as he reached speeds of up to 106mph.

After dumping the car five miles from the scene, he returned to the home of his girlfriend Sara Hughes, who was in the passenger seat.

He then phoned 999 reporting that the care was stolen, later telling police that he fled because his girlfriend had been smoking cannabis in the car.

Describing Bilal as a 'fine young man', Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC said no sentence would be enough for his heartbroken family.

But he said he hoped Khan’s punishment for the 'extremely shocking and serious offences' would bring some comfort.

Following the hearing, Bilal’s family 
thanked those involved in bringing his killer to justice and described the schoolboy as 'one in a million'.

The statement said: 'We mourn and weep for Bilal every second of the day and 
would give anything to have him back.

Killed: Bilal Khizar, 12, was thrown 54 metres when he was hit by the car as he crossed the road in Bradford on his scooter

Fatal: Friends leaving floral tributes to Bilal, described by the judge as a 'fine young man', following the incident

'He was one in a million - kind, loving, sincere, loyal, genuine, humble, caring, affectionate and most of all, religious. No parent, brother or sister should feel the needless pain and suffering we have endured.

'For the rest of our lives we will 
have family occasions, gatherings and celebrations ruined because Bilal 
is missing and there is an empty chair.

'It is a day-to-day struggle and these
people need to realise how their actions have left this family 
completely devastated and shattered.'

Tribute: Bilal Khizar's family described the schoolboy as 'one in a million' in a statement

The court heard how Bilal, of Bradford, had been visiting school friends shortly before his death.

Police on patrol nearby noticed Khan overtaking at excessive speed and stopped him, but he pulled away 'as fast as his vehicle was able to do so'.

Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, said: 'Khan appears to have been intent on, and focused solely upon, getting away from the police.'

Bilal, who was pushing a scooter, was crossing Rooley Lane at a pedestrian crossing when Khan approached at 84mph - more than twice the 40mph limit.

CCTV screened in court showed the moment Khan, from Halifax, hit him, catapulting him 54 metres down the road.

'He collided with Bilal, who was projected into the air, smashing the nearside of the car’s windscreen and tearing backwards the front nearside wing of the car, and then forward along the road surface,' Mr Sharp added.

'He suffered massive head injuries and it may be of some comfort to his family that he died instantly.'

Mr Sharp said Bilal was crossing on a red man signal but added 'If Khan had been driving at or near the speed limit he would have had ample time to see Bilal crossing.'

After the incident, Khan 'calmly' called 999 and reported his car stolen in what Judge Durham Hall called a 'crafted, convincing' act.

In interviews with police, Khan and Hughes admitted the lie, but said he could not avoid hitting Bilal as he 'ran out.'

He later pleaded guilty to death by dangerous driving and intending to pervert the course of justice.

Hughes, who was today bailed and her sentence adjourned for assessments, also admitted the latter charge.

Runaway: After the incident, Khan sped off, reaching speeds of 106mph as he evaded police, and dumped the car five miles from the scene

The court heard that Khan was uninsured at the time of the crash after mistakenly believing his father’s company policy covered him.

Simon Csoka QC, defending Khan, said he was genuinely remorseful and still experiences flashbacks.

'The defendant cannot begin to explain why he behaved in the way that he did. He cannot escape the invasive thoughts about what happened,' he said.

Khan bowed his head as Judge Durham Hall said his case was among the most serious of its kind.

'You have pleaded guilty to a serious and very grave offence; looked at together, extremely shocking and serious offences,' the judge said.

'The young man suffered catastrophic injuries and died instantly. You raced off knowing you had inevitably caused the most serious damage to another human being.

'Nothing I can do will bring back Bilal and no punishment I can impose as a judge, I recognise, can even satisfy the outrage and anger and I rather suspect the deep grief and wounds of the victim’s family.'
