A legally blind teenager has been offered a spot on the Tulane University football teamafter becoming a valuable part of his high school team.

Aaron Golub is the long snapper for Newton High School outside of Boston and his skills on the field will be leading him to New Orleans this fall when he heads to college after being awarded a preferred walk on spot for the team.

'If you set your mind to it you can do it. There’s nothing you can’t accomplish if you really want to do it,' he told CBS Boston.

On the field: Aaron Golub is legally blind but is able to play football in a limited capacity by only doing the long snaps for special plays

Disability: Aaron, 17, was born without being able to see out of his right eye and has limited vision in his left

The 17-year-old has no vision out of his right eye and very limited vision out of his left. 

He was born with his disability, but that hasn't stopped him from playing the game he loves.

CBS Boston reports that Aaron plays as the team long snapper, meaning that he pitches the ball back to the kicker on special plays and punts.

The position requires a great amount of precision and speed, both of which he has been able to perfect through hours of training with a specially-made net.

Aaron trains in the school gym and on 
the football field with the net- which has three pockets at different 
heights that gives him a direction to aim for- before school every day 
and on the weekends.

His coach says that the hard work has paid off.

Practice: Aaron trains every day before school and on the weekends and has been a starter on his team for the past two years

Targeted: He hones his skills and precision by working with a specialized net so that he can practice getting the ball into one of three pockets at different heights

Big step: Aaron has since been offered a preferred walk on spot on the Tulane Universary football team

'He’s only had one bad snap in the last two years he’s snapped for us,' Ted Dalicandro told CBS.

'He’s best long snapper I’ve seen on the high school level.'

Fox News reports that when he went to a snapping training camp, he and his father brought goggles with them that showed what it is like to have his vision.

'(Aaron) wouldn’t stop until he reached his goal and, most likely, silenced the countless people that told him he wouldn’t be able to do what he wanted because of his "disability,"' said Chris Rubio, the head of the long snapping camp that Aaron attended in July 2012.
