Los Angeles-based auctioneers Nate D Sanders sold the historic item, described as 'missing a button, else near fine'.

The size three coat, given to Andrew B. Harvey by Lennon's friend Jon Hendricks in 1978, fetched more than $5,000 over its reserve price.

Mr Harvey said: 'This British fireman's coat once belonged to John Lennon and it was given to me in 1978 by Jon Hendricks, my (then) common-law wife's uncle.

'In 1978 we went to stay with Jon for a few weeks.

'He told me the fireman's coat hanging in the hall had been left there by John Lennon when he'd called in a few months earlier.

'I think that was the last time he saw John Lennon.

'Jon asked me if I wanted the coat, as I was off on a cross-country hitch-hiking trip and I didn't have one so I wore it through a couple of hard years.'

The label showing the greatcoat was a size three meant for someone 5ft 4in to 5ft 6in tall

A description from the auction house read: 'John Lennon personally owned coat.

'Blue cropped coat features an asymmetrical design, epaulettes and silver tone metal buttons.

'Features a brand label of Great Coat Fireman in size three. Missing a button, else near fine.'

The iconic coat, designed by Great Coat Fireman, eventually ended up in the possession of Connecticut-based Beatles collector Keith Marron who put it up for sale through the auction house.

Yesterday, it was revealed handwritten lyrics for Bob Dylan's 
'Like a Rolling Stone', one of the most popular songs of all time, are 
going under the hammer this summer and could fetch a record $2 million.

Sotheby's
 is offering a working draft of the finished song in Dylan's own hand 
for an estimated $1 million to $2 million. The previous record sale for 
lyrics sold were from the John Lennon song 'A Day in the Life'

The song is about a debutante who becomes a loner when she's cast from upper-class social circles.
