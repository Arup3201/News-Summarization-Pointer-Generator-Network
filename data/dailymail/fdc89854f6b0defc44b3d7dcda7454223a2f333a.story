As a recent survey reveals that women are more concerned with the state of their skin than any other body hang-up, it is no surprise the skincare business has rolled out a multitude of products that promise to turn back the effects of time.

But one area that often gets neglected is the delicate area above the eye because no product has ever been designed to target that specific area - until now.

Elizabeth Arden has unveiled PREVAGE Anti-aging + Intensive Repair Eye Serum - an eye treatment that claims to help reduce the severe signs of skin aging in just one use, especially the look of deep lines and crepiness that affect the delicate upper eyelid area.

Developed in partnership with Bascom-Palmer Eye Institute, the leading centre for eye research and aesthetics, the new cream even claims to work in just fifteen minutes.

The new formulation combines Elizabeth Arden’s exclusive idebenone technology, the single most powerful antioxidant, with a blend of arazine and thiotaine.

Arazine claims to soothe skin and help reduce signs of ageing caused by inflammation, while thiotaine promises to protect skin from free radical damage due to environmental assaults.

It also utilises moisture trap technology - a 
complex of hyaluronic acid, barley and sea plant extracts that work to 
help lock in moisture and plump and smooth skin.

It contains optical diffusers and silicones, which claim to provide a soft focus effect to 
scatter light and diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles for
immediate bright and luminous skin.

But does it work? Apparently so; 75 per cent of women noted a clinical improvement in deep and fine lines in 15 minutes after use.  

The results also revealed that seven out of 10 women preferred the new Prevage serum to their regular eye serum.

But youth doesn't come cheap: the 15ml serum, which is available in Boots and should be applied twice daily, will set you back £95.

Speaking about the product, Dr Yannis Alexandrides, founder of 111 Harley St said: 'While the results published certainly do sound impressive, it’s important to review the ingredients that are giving these "instant" results.

'Just a glance at the formula shows that it is rich in hyaluronic acid which superficially plumps the skin surface but the effect is not long lasting.

'The 15-minute promise is largely down to the optical diffusers which are cosmetic agents, these are also found in foundation and concealers and reflect light off the skin, making wrinkles appear less prominent.'

Beauty blogger Charlie Lankston of Small Fish Big Pond added: ‘This intensive eye serum applies beautifully - the lightweight formula means it blends effortlessly into your skin and doesn’t feel heavy or greasy around the eyes.

'It is good at tackling fine lines above the eyes, but doesn’t do a huge amount to combat dark circles so isn’t the best option for anyone hoping to fight those at the same time.

‘And while it’s a beautiful product - and of the highest quality - the price is really quite high and makes it out of the reach of a lot of women who won’t be able to afford nearly £100 for an eye serum.

'For those that can afford it and want something high-end to help tackle their lines, this is the perfect product, however for anyone hoping for a bit more of an all-rounder, there are plenty of other options available at much more reasonable prices which may be more suited to their needs.'
