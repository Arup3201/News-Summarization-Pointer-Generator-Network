A popular American cruise line is under scrutiny after refusing to let a Long Island, New York family re-book a $4,000 summer vacation after their son was diagnosed with cancer.

Tara and Philip Colucci are outraged with Norwegian Cruise lines after they refused to let them reschedule their June 1st cruise to a later date after their son Nicolas was diagnosed with cancer on May 19.

The cruise line has a strict cancellation policy stating that if a cruise is cancelled less than 14 days before the trip that there is a 100 per cent cancellation fee of $4,000.

Policy overboard: Norwegian Cruise Line is refusing to let the Colucci family reschedule their dream vacation after their son Nicolas (second right) was diagnosed with cancer just a day late of the 14 days cancellation policy

Nicolas, who dreamed of going on his first cruise, is still undergoing half of his chemotherapy treatment and recently had 60 percent of his liver, his gallbladder, diaphragm, and lymph nodes removed and is in no shape to travel.

Even when Tara told Norwegian Cruise Line about her situation, she says they gave her little to no sympathy and instead suggested that she get travelers insurance.

Tara's husband was shocked to learn the cruise line's response to their family's request.

'I felt that a cruise line that is family-oriented, who caters to families . . . it was a Nickelodeon cruise; I was just astounded,' he told Fox.

'I couldn’t believe that they wouldn’t have helped us out.'

Norwegian Cruise Line later issued a statement to Fox & Friends saying, 'Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the Colucci family and we wish Nicolas a speedy recover. . . After reviewing the request of the Colucci family, we spoke with the family and explained that while we couldn’t make an exception to our policy, we would assist them when they were ready to re-book their cruise.'

New found hope: A CEO of another cruise line, who wished to remain anonymous, told Tara that when her son Nicolas is healthy again that she and her family are treated to a free vacation

Tara told Fox that while Norwegian expressed solace in their press statement, they couldn't guarantee her a spot on a future cruise.

'It’s not like our son got the flu or a cold and we couldn’t go,' Tara Colucci told MyFoxNY.'I just never imagined, especially a company as big as Norwegian, that they would be so heartless, basically.'Even though the Colucci family felt as though they were being mistreated by Norwegian Cruise Line, another cruise line stepped up and offered the family a cruise free of Charge.

Tara Colucci says she received a personal phone call from the CEO of a mystery cruise line who offered them a free cruise whenever their son is feeling healthy again.

Colucci recognized the CEO's kind actions and also told FOX that travellers should always take out travelers insurance and that they should opt out from using Norwegian Cruise Line.
