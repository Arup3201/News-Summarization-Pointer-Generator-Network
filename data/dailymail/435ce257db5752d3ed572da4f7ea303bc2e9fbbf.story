Nato will not prevent Colonel Gaddafi fleeing Libya, a senior Western diplomat said last night.

The diplomat said the West had no remit to bomb any vehicles the ousted tyrant may be using.

Rebels also seemed anxious for Gaddafi to leave as they tried to avoid further bloodshed and finally end his 42-year rule.

Which way? Anti-Gaddafi fighters ride on a vehicle with a multiple rocket launcher outside Khamis brigade's military base, which was destroyed by a Nato air strike, some 22 miles east of Bani Walid

The envoy spoke as special forces claimed Gaddafi was in the south of Libya, just 200 miles from Niger.

He said: ‘Convoys heading a long way away from civilian centres don’t seem to meet the Nato mandate.

‘If they start threatening civilian  centres then I suspect they will come under that mandate.

‘But we haven’t got any evidence that that’s in train at the moment.’

Asked about reports of a Gaddafi convoy crossing into Niger, he said: ‘Those around Gaddafi appear to be recognising that the game is up.Those are welcome indications.’

Yesterday the 69-year-old was said to be in the village of Ghwat, close to the Algerian and Niger borders.

His wife, daughter and two sons have been given sanctuary in Algeria but  a rebel official leading the hunt for him said ‘many sources’ suggested Gaddafi was heading south to Niger or Chad.

Niger has said it is unable to meet Libya’s request to close the border because it is simply too big to police.

The SAS and special forces from Arab countries have been tracking Gaddafi and his family since the fall of Tripoli more than two weeks ago, but his fate will rest in the hands of rebel fighters.

Last night claims emerged that his family remaining in Libya, including his son Saif al-Islam, had fled the town of Bani Walid in the past week and were also heading south.

To add to the mystery, some rebels claimed they had Gaddafi cornered and would ‘detain him or kill him’.

One, Anis Sharif, declared confidently: ‘He can’t get out.’

A
terrifying cache of  missiles capable of shooting down passenger planes
has been stolen from Gaddafi’s arsenal in Libya, it was claimed 
yesterday.

Almost 500 of the Russian-made 
heat-seeking missiles have been looted in the past week, prompting fears
they have been sold to Al Qaeda  for use against the West.

Peter Bouckaert, of Human Rights Watch, said: ‘These missiles are some of the most advanced weaponry in the world. 

‘If Al Qaeda get hold of them, they could turn all of North Africa into a no-fly zone.’

The SA-24 ‘Grinch’ missiles were 
moved out of Tripoli when the Nato bombing began and hidden in farm 
buildings and warehouses, with other missiles, land mines, plastic 
explosives, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.

But after Tripoli fell to rebels last month, the weapons were left unguarded.

Mr Bouckaert said similar warehouses 
had been looted across Libya and surface-to-air missiles targeted, 
suggesting that they were stolen to order.

The Government will spend £140million buying new bombs to replace those dropped on Libya, the Defence Secretary has announced.

Liam Fox said the Treasury reserve, money kept aside from routine budgets, will fund the cost of the explosives.

He said: ‘Based upon current consumption rates, we estimate the cost of replenishing munitions may be up to £140 million.

‘The Treasury has agreed to meet these costs from the reserve.’

The RAF and Royal Navy waged a 
campaign on Libyan targets as part of a coalition enforcing a United 
Nations Security resolution in March.

The resolution aimed to protect 
civilians as then Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi’s forces closed 
in on its second city, Benghazi.

David Cameron had previously told the Commons on Monday  that the operation had cost £120million with pilots 
flying more than 2,400 sorties enforcing a no-fly zone and hitting 
targets.

He said Gaddafi was trapped within a 40-mile radius in an area surrounded by rebels and with his movement monitored by spy planes.

‘It is only a matter of time,’ he added. ‘We are just playing games with him.’

However he did not say exactly where rebels believe Gaddafi is.

Other senior rebel leaders remained cautious, saying Africa’s ‘most wanted’ man was still in the country but not that his hiding place had been uncovered or he was close to arrest.

Earlier this week a convoy of Gaddafi loyalists, including his security chief, fled across the Sahara into Niger in a move that Libya’s former rebels hoped could help lead to the surrender of his last strongholds.

The safe passage of the convoys, which included wagons loaded with gold and cash, into landlocked Niger was said to have been brokered by South Africa and France on behalf of Nato.

In Niger’s capital Niamey, a spokesman for the president confirmed that Gaddafi’s security chief had crossed the desert into Niger but categorically denied that Gaddafi or his sons had entered the country yet.

With many vehicles carrying Gaddafi loyalists heading for the former French colony of Burkina Faso, it was reported that the ex-leader had joined them en route.

Burkina Faso, one of the world’s  poorest countries, is one of the few to have offered Gaddafi political asylum and a major part of the convoy is said to be heading for the capital Ouagadougou.

A spokesman for the government of President Blaise Compaore said Gaddafi would be arrested and handed to the International Criminal Court if he turned up there.
