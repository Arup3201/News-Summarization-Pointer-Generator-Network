On the day Governor Christie's deputy chief of staff accompanied him to view fire damage at New Jersey's Seaside Heights, she was receiving messages about the bridge closures, documents show.

Bridget Kelly, who was fired on Thursday for her alleged role in lane closures on George Washington Bridge, was pictured on September 12 last year, staring intently at her phone during a photo call.

The photo was taken just a few hours after Ms Kelly was involved in an email conversation about the bridge as safety fears about the closure were raised.

By September 12, the bridge - a vital link between New Jersey and Manhattan - had been closed for four days.

Before the 7pm visit to the fire-damaged broadwalk, Ms Kelly had received an email from the Port Authority of New York, according to North Jersey.com.

The email read: 'The Port Authority is reviewing traffic
 safety patterns at the George Washington Bridge to ensure proper 
placement of toll lanes.'

Ms Kelly apparently also forwarded a message 
to Mr Wildstein from Christina Genovese Renna, her director of 
departmental relations, at 3.36pm.

The email stated that Fort Lee Mayor 
Mark Sokolich, the man the team were allegedly trying to punish, had 
called to complain about the closures and their impact on road safety.

'Evan told the 
fine Mayor he was unaware that the toll lanes were closed, but he would 
see what he could find out,' Ms Genovese Renna wrote, referring to the person who took the message.Â 

Chris Christie, pictured on Thursday, denied he had any prior knowledge of the bridge plan

They were just a few of the messages 
sent that day to Ms Kelly, as well as to New Jersey executive David 
Wildstein and former senator Bill Baroni, who both resigned over the 
closures.

Other 
messages sent between 3.11pm and 5.27pm on September 12 included a 
request from the Record for information about the closures.

On Thursday Christie fired Ms Kelly and apologized, while saying he was shocked that one of his aides would lie and betray him.
