It seems Dynamo Moscow frontman Aleksandr Kokorin is one of those footballer's who is keen to win by any means possible.

The striker scored a goal reminiscent of Diego Maradona's 'Hand of God' goal during Dynamo Moscow's 7-3 victory over Rostov on Sunday.

Replays showed the 23-year-old rose to meet Balazs Dzsudzsak's left-wing cross and converted the ball with his hand to complete his hat-trick having initially appeared to score with his head.
