Two firefighters battling a massive blaze at a vacant warehouse were killed yesterday when an adjacent furniture store they were inspecting collapsed, burying them in a pile of debris.

The fire, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, started at around 3.15am and quickly spread. Dozens of nearby homes were evacuated, 
and the firefighters were trying to make sure that the flames were out at the
neighbouring building when the roof and a wall caved in.

It took about two hours to extract the bodies of Lt. Robert Neary, 60, and Daniel Sweeney, 25, because of all the rubble, fire commissioner Lloyd Ayers said. Two other firefighters were rescued from the site, in the city’s Kensington section, and taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

The cause of the blaze was not immediately determined.

'We are deeply saddened by the loss of these two firefighters,' Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter said.

'It just hurts a great, great deal.'

Both firefighters were respected members of the fire department and had been commended for a long list of rescues over the years, Mr Ayers said.

Lt Neary, a 37-year veteran of the fire department, served in the Army reserves from 1972 to 1982 and worked as a police officer before joining the fire service. He is survived by his wife, two adult sons and a daughter.

He was a mentor to young colleagues like Mr Sweeney and had great instincts while fighting fires, said Timothy McShea, vice-president of the firefighters union.

'He was just a great guy, knew the 
job very well,' McShea said. 'He’s like one of these old-school guys. 
They just have a second sense about them.'

Mr Sweeney, who was single, is survived by his parents. His father is recently retired fire Captain David Sweeney.

Mr McShea called the 25-year-old 'a good young lad'.

'Danny was a young, aggressive firefighter,' he said.

City officials said the warehouse’s corporate owner, York Street Property Development, had been cited three times since November and a fourth citation was issued after a March 29 inspection, following a community meeting. Officials said that the city was preparing to take the owner to court as required after the first three violations and that, separately, a sheriff’s sale was expected this summer because of unpaid tax and water bills.

Fran Burns, commissioner of the 
city’s Licenses and Inspections department, said York Street Property 
Development had a zoning permit valid until July 2013 for an 81-unit 
development.

'This isn’t a 
landowner or property owner we couldn’t find; this is someone who had a 
very active interest in the property and has an active and open zoning 
permit for development,' she said.

'I
don’t understand, when you have a zoning permit for an 81-unit 
development, that you don’t understand your responsibility to have a 
secure property.'

The New York-based law firm Herrick, 
Feinstein, representing York Street Property Development, called the 
fire 'an unspeakable tragedy'.

'Our
condolences and heartfelt prayers go out to the families of Lt. Neary 
and Firefighter Sweeney, and to their grieving colleagues at the 
Philadelphia Fire Department,' attorney David Feuerstein said in a 
statement.

'We are 
co-operating, and will continue to do so, with all law enforcement and 
government agencies as they investigate this fire.'

Everett
Gillison, deputy mayor for public safety, said he will be talking to 
the district attorney about whether a criminal negligence prosecution is
warranted.

Mr Gillison said city officials were 
to meet today with attorneys for the owners, whom they identified as 
Nahman Lichtenstein, along with Yechiel and Michael Lichtenstein.

Ms
Burns said the owners were linked - through York Street Property 
Development and another firm - to perhaps 34 other properties in the city.
A message left for a Philadelphia law firm officials said represented 
them was not returned last night, nor was a message left for 
Nahman Lichtenstein.

Michael
Lichtenstein told the blog Hidden Daily Philadelphia last month that a 
development planned for the warehouse had stalled because of the 
economy. He said he wasn’t sure who was responsible for managing and 
maintaining the property but 'the building is being kept up'.

Residents
tried to seal up the building, cleaned litter around the premises and 
reported their concerns to the city over the past year, said Jeff 
Carpineta, president of the East Kensington Neighbors Association.

They also wrote a letter several 
months ago to an attorney listed in public records as the contact for 
the owners, Mr Carpineta said. The structure was repeatedly left open 
and unsecure, he added.

'The building was becoming an anxiety because a lot of us were concerned about the building burning down,' he said.

Mr Carpineta blasted city officials 
for not taking the initiative to secure the premises. The cost would 
have been minuscule compared with the damage wrought by the blaze, he 
said.

'At what point does the city say, "We need to do what’s right"?' Mr Carpineta said.

As
the fire spread from the warehouse, flames poured from the windows as 
crews doused water on it from all sides. Hot embers from the main fire 
blew to nearby structures, causing small fires that damaged six homes.

Fire engines lined the nearby streets
for hours after the blaze was brought under control. Bricks and debris 
were scattered on the roads surrounding the fire scene, where much of 
the warehouse had collapsed. Many of its outer walls had crumbled to the
ground by the time the fire was extinguished.

Police began banging on the doors of 
nearby homes shortly after the fire was reported. No injuries were 
reported among the people displaced.

The
Red Cross of Southeastern Pennsylvania set up a shelter and offered aid
to about two dozen people who had been forced from their homes. By 
10.30am, most had left to see if their houses had been damaged.

Twenty-nine
minutes after the fire was brought under control, an alarm went out for
the trapped firefighters. Mr Ayers said the department last lost a 
firefighter in 2006. The last time it lost multiple firefighters on a 
call was 2004. Mayor Nutter ordered flags in the city to be flown at 
half-staff for 30 days.

Mr Ayers said the community was providing the fire department much support.

He said: 'Just as we give service to our citizens, they’re serving us right now.'
