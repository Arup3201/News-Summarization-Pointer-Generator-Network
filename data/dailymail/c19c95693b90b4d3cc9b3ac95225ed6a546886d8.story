The shadow of secret justice has ‘chillingly’ reached the highest court in Britain, campaigners warned last night.

Liberty reacted with horror to a ruling by the Supreme Court that it was prepared to consider material delivered behind closed doors.

In the past, neither the court nor its predecessor - the Law Lords - had considered secret evidence.

Isabella Sankey, Director of Policy for Liberty, said that the Supreme Court had no statutory power to consider the ruling, delivered by High Court judge Mr Justice Mitting (left)

But a panel of nine Supreme Court justices concluded that the court had the jurisdiction to consider a secret High Court ruling based on evidence given to a judge at a private hearing.

Liberty had argued - at a Supreme Court hearing in London - that the Supreme Court had no statutory power to consider the ruling, delivered by High Court judge Mr Justice Mitting three years ago.

Isabella Sankey, Director of Policy for Liberty, said: ‘Chillingly the shadow of secret justice now spreads to the highest court in the land.’

The Supreme Court justices had been considering a secret ruling given during a case involving the Government and an Iranian bank accused of indirectly helping finance Iran’s nuclear weapons programme.

Bank Mellat is trying to overturn an order, made by the Treasury under counter-terrorism legislation, which bars it from operating in the UK.

Bank bosses say the order is unlawful and unfair.

They have appealed to the Supreme Court after failing to persuade the High Court and the Court of Appeal to overturn the order.

Mr Justice Mitting had heard evidence behind closed doors when Bank Mellat mounted a High Court challenge in 2010 - and delivered a secret judgment based on that evidence.

The Court of Appeal considered that secret judgment before dismissing Bank Mellat’s appeal in 2011.

Treasury ministers, who have the power to impose sanctions on anyone involved in nuclear weapons development which poses a 'significant risk' to the UK, had argued that the Supreme Court could and should consider Mr Justice Mitting’s secret judgment before ruling on Bank Mellat’s latest appeal.

But Bank Mellat, which has not seen Mr Justice Mitting’s secret ruling, had argued that the Supreme Court had no statutory power to consider the secret judgment and did not need to consider the secret judgment when making a decision on whether or not to overturn the Treasury order.

Liberty had also said the Supreme Court had no statutory power to consider secret material.

Lord Neuberger said justices had decided that the Supreme Court had the jurisdiction to consider Mr Justice Mitting’s secret judgment.

But he said justices had yet to decide whether they needed to consider the ruling in order to make a decision on Bank Mellat’s appeal, which continues.

The Mail has been campaigning against the introduction of courts to hear some civil compensation cases in secret.
