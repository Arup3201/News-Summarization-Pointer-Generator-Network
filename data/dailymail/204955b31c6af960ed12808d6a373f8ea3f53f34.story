A substitute teacher and an EMT have been arrested after being caught selling drugs.

Lisa Testa and Joseph Meyer were arrested on Thursday after they were caught selling heroin and other narcotics.

Brooklyn police reportedly caught the two as a result of an undercover sting operation, The New York Daily News reports.

Testa, 33, came under suspicion when police received an anonymous letter saying that she was selling crack cocaine and other drugs.

A sting operation was launched from there and police bought prescription medication and heroin on multiple occasions. Police were never able to purchase crack cocaine.

The investigation was focused on Testa but it extended to Meyer, 25, when police started trying to track down her supplier and they found that they were selling the same drugs.

Testa and Meyer are said to be friends though it has not yet been revealed how they specifically worked together.

Tip off: Police reportedly received an anonymous letter saying Testa, 33, was selling crack cocaine and they launched a sting operation where officers were able to buy drugs from her multiple times

Dishonoring the badge: The investigation did not start out involving Meyer, 25, but when they started looking for Testa's supplier they realized her friend Meyer was selling the same drugs

They were both charged with the criminal sale of a controlled substance and other unspecified drug-related charges.

Meyer had been working as an emergency medical technician under the purview of the fire department for the past two years but was suspended for 30 days without pay upon his arrest.

Testa was not a regular substitute teacher for New York City public schools and only taught for two days back in 2008 but at the time of her arrest she was still listed as a possible substitute in the department's database.

The Daily News reports that her name was only placed on the 'do not call list' once she was arrested.

Testa's mother, Grace Testa, spoke to the paper and said that her daughter has a history of drug abuse.

Dangerous: Police were able to buy prescription pills and heroin from both but not crack cocaine which was the subject of the original tip-off letter

'I’ve been begging her to go to rehab for a long time,' Mrs Testa told The Daily News.

'It’s not her personality to sell drugs. Maybe to take it, but not to sell it.

'She’s a good girl, that’s all I can tell you.... She never gave me problems. She stays home, she stays with her family. She doesn’t even go out to clubs or anything.'

Mrs Testa said that her daughter was not in a relationship with Meyer, calling him 'just a friend', but she did not seem to be surprised that he was involved.

'He has a drug problem, too. They’re trying to stop it,' Mrs Testa said.
