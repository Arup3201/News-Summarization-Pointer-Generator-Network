The woman at the center of the firestorm surrounding Clippers owner Donald Sterling has broken her silence in her first television interview.

V. Stiviano sat down with Barbara Walters tonight on ABC's 20/20 to give her take on the racism controversy the broke when audio recordings of Stiviano and Sterling were made public.

Incredibly, the 31-year-old, who described herself as Sterling's 'silly rabbit,' said she does not believe Donald Sterling is a racist.

Most-talked about woman: V. Stiviano finally broke her silence over the Donald Sterling racism controversy

'I don't believe it in my heart,' she said, adding that although she's heard him make racist comments, she doesn't think he truly believes them.

'I think the things he says are not the things he feels,' she said. 'Anyone can say anything in the heat of the moment.'

When Stiviano sat down to speak with Walters, she had reportedly just been in the company of Donald Sterling.

She described his mindset as, 'Confused. I think he feels very alone. Not truly supported by those around him. Tormented. Emotionally traumatized.'

Stiviano said she was urging Sterling to 'come to his own rescue.'

Sterling has been stung by his treatment by his peers, the media, from his employees and acquaintances, Stiviano said.

On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life, fined him $2.5 million and urged league owners to force him to sell the team. A three-quarters vote by the NBA owners is required to force him to sell.

Stiviano told Walters that she 'absolutely' thinks Sterling should apologize for his comments, but that 'only God knows' if he will.

She also said she believes Sterling's outrageous comments were, in part, a generational issue.

'I think Mr Sterling's from a different generation than I am. I think he was brought up to believe these things,' she said, before accidentally tipping Walters off that despite being a Jew, Sterling has anti-Semitic views also.

'But through his actions, he's shown that he's not a racist. Through his actions, he's shown himself to be a very generous and kind man,' she said.

The racist diatribe which Sterling can be heard making on audio recorded by Stiviano herself, was prompted by people saying bad things about Sterling's relationship with Stiviano.

In abstract and sometimes rambling 
terms, Stiviano appeared to paint herself as Sterling's savior during 
his time of need - despite the fact that it is alleged she released the 
recordings responsible for his downfall herself.

'I
 think Mr Sterling is being tested right now, by a higher power or 
being. And I'm forced to come to his rescue because he can't rescue 
himself.'

When pressed to 
explain the relationship between herself and Sterling, Stiviano said, 
'I'm Mr Sterling's personal assistant. Like I said, I'm his right hand. 
I'm his wingman. What isn't there to understand?'

Walters asked whether Stiviano, then, is Sterling's employee.

'He
 first started paying me as an employee and then he started paying me 
off the books,' she responded, no doubt referring to the million-dollar 
home, four luxury cars and $240,000 'living expenses' she has reportedly
 received.

'I became part of
 Mr Sterling's team. I became someone who protected him, someone who 
took care of him, someone who watched everything he said and did, and 
people did not like that.'

'So you helped him become a better person?' asked Walters.

'In every way. In every way,' responded Stiviano.

'Silly rabbit': V. Stiviano described herself to Barbara Walters as Donald Sterling's 'everything'

She wouldn't allow Sterling to take meetings with certain people, Stiviano told Walters, which angered his business peers.

She
 said that executives and board members of the Clippers who were jealous
 of the free reign she had when it came to the team would call Sterling 
and tell him that Stiviano had brought people 'who look a certain way' 
to Clippers games when she wasn't there.

But
 not just black people, Stiviano claimed, but people 'that didn't give 
me a good look,' like 'gangsters,' 'thugs,' 'bad women.'

Walters asked, 'Are you in love with Donald Sterling?'

'I love him,' Stiviano responded, smiling widely, adding that she's not in love but rather loves him 'like a father figure.'

Denying she's Sterling's 'mistress' or 'whore,' she said that she's more like his friend and right hand.

'I’m Mr. Sterling’s everything. I’m his confidante, his best friend, his silly rabbit,' she said, bizarrely.

Stiviano
 said the pair met while she was working for Sterling's non-profit 
organization, the Donald T Sterling Foundation and evolved 'to so much 
more.'

Throughout the day prior to Stiviano's interview, Sterling had been in talks with both Barbara Walters and Anderson Cooper about appearing on camera, but pulled out at the last minute, putting Stiviano in the hot seat with Walters and leaving Cooper without an interview, reports TMZ.

After the lengthy talk with Walters, Stiviano put her now-customary visor back over her face to face the waiting paparazzi. She told Walters it is a protective measure.

'I'm hurting, I'm in pain. It hurts to see someone you  care about hurting. It hurts to see people speculate, assume, say, throw darts at you when they don't know you ... It's easier to mask the pain.'
