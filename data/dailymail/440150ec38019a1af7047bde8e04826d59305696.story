Found alive: Georg Luxi's disappearance sparked a massive hunt by police and his devastated daughters

A German multimillionaire with dementia who vanished without trace two years ago has been found alive with a new wife and stepson - who now stand to inherit his vast fortune.

Georg Luxi disappeared from his home in Deggendorf, Bavaria, on December 15 2010, sparking a massive hunt by police and his devastated daughters Eveline, 61, and Gabrielle, 55.

But when the women finally found him,Â  say the only contact they have had with their father since his reappearance has been through his new wife, Christa, and her son, Joseph.

The new family claims he is happy in Austria and has demonstrated his love for them by signing over all of his property and wealth to them - including giving them access to his bank accounts.

Now, in a legal first in Germany, Eveline and Gabrielle have filed a lawsuit against Christa and Joe, whose surnames do not appear on court papers, claiming embezzlement and false imprisonment.

They claim the mother and son effectively kidnapped their father - who they say suffers from Alzheimer's Disease - and brainwashed him into leaving them all his money.

They now want him returned to Germany where they say he can get the care and supervision he needs.

The retired entrepreneur, who made his fortune in the fruit wholesale business, had several million euros in his bank 
accounts as well as seven luxury properties in Germany.

Mr Luxi is said to have met Christa after the death of his first wife.

A sports-car enthusiast, he enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, splashing out on luxury homes across the town in which he lived.

Vanished: Mr Luxi, 86, disappeared from his home in Deggendorf, Bavaria, in 2010. His new family say he is happy and does not wish to be contacted

But in around 2005, Eveline says his mind began to deteriorate, and he began forgetting basic facts about her such as what she did for a living and even her age.

He had also begun a relationship with
Christa. From that point, Eveline claims contact with her father 
steadily declined until it completely fizzled out.

He stopped answering her phone calls and letters and even missed his sister's funeral in September 2009.

Then came a letter, apparently signed by Mr Luxi, apologising for being so difficult to contact because he had been busy walking and travelling.

'If I have time, I'll write again,' he wrote.

In the following months, he wrote a handful of letters, including one to cancel plans to spend Christmas with his daughters. Then his correspondence completely dried up.

But, while the handwriting was undoubtedly his, Eveline and Gabrielle claim the words and phrases in his final letters appeared less and less familiar, as though they had been dictated to him.

They filed a missing persons report in December 2010 and, in January 2012, a court in Deggendorf ruled him to be in 'imminent danger' and expressed 'real doubts over the honesty' of Christa and Joseph, according to newspaper Sud Deutsche.

While Eveline says she has all but given up hope of seeing any of her father's fortune, she says she just wants to see him again.

'I cannot sleep, am nervous and broken,' she told Sud Deutsche. 'I am in a state of grief.'

But Joseph, Mr Luxi's de facto spokesman, apparently wrote in a letter to the court: 'Mr. Georg Luxi is a staunch, former entrepreneur and does what he wants... [he] enjoys his life as a free citizen.'
