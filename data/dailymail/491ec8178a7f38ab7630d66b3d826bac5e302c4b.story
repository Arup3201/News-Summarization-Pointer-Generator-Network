Details surrounding JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's ex-wife have emerged from the first time after she has spent the past half-century hiding from the public eye.

Marina Porter, now a 72-year-old grandmother collecting Social Security, has lived in Rockwall,Texas since the mid-1970s with her second husband Kenneth Porter and three children.

As the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination looms, sources claim that Marina refuses to believe that her former husband shot dead the president in his Dallas motorcade on that fateful November day.

Marina Oswald Porter, widow of Lee Harvey Oswald who assassinated JFK, told a press conference in 1977: 'I believe that Lee acted alone in this murder and shot the President , ironically a man whom he respected and admired'. She now no longer believes he killed the president

Lee Harvey Oswald, his wife Marina, and his daughter June Lee, when they lived in Minsk in the USSR, shortly before they moved to the U.S.

Marina, a Russian immigrant to the U.S., was living apart from Oswald when he shot dead President Kennedy on November 22, 1963.

The night before the assassination she remembers him bringing his rifle to her home and putting it in the garage. The next day, she noticed it was gone.

Due to her relationship with Oswald, Marina found herself the focus of intense scrutiny, so has spent many years hidden away in the small town, where a sign at the end of her driveway warns to 'Keep Out'.

Two years after the JFK assassination, Marina married Kenneth Porter and they moved to Texas around ten years later. The family settled in Rockwall just 20 miles from Dallas.

Assassin's ring: A wedding band worn by Lee Harvey Oswald until just hours before he killed President John F. Kennedy was sold at auction this month for $108,000

She has two daughters by Oswald - June and Rachel - who confirmed to the National Enquirer that Marina does believe their father was innocent of the shooting and just a patsy for the Mafia and CIA. The Porters also have a son called Mark.

The 72-year-old Mrs Porter has changed her mind about Oswald's guilt, according to the report, after reading books and watching documentaries on the assassination which has been mired in conspiracy theories for decades.

A close friend, documentary filmmaker Keya Morgan, told the Enquirer: 'She certainly doesn't believe the official story - she always told me Lee Harvey Oswald loved President Kennedy.

'Marina says she remembers the day the Kennedys' premature baby Patrick died (August 7, 1963) and she found Lee sobbing.'

Despite her change of heart over Oswald, Mrs Porter's neighbors in Rockwall told the National Enquirer that she is a much-loved member of the local community.

Fred McCurley, who lives nearby, told the Enquirer: 'She and Ken are good people, the  best neighbors you could ever have.'

In
 July, Mrs Porter announced that she putting his wedding ring up for 
auction as she breaks the final ties to what she describes as the 'worst
 day of my life'.

She had 
given the band up to be auctioned in New Hampshire after it was returned
 to her following 50 years lost in an attorney's folder of legal papers 
from the trial.

The ring sold to an anonymous Texas bidder on October 24 for $108,000.

It is accompanied by a fascinating letter written by Mrs Porter which gives the background to the historical object.

A small section reads: 'At this time of my life, I don’t 
wish to have Lee’s ring in my possession because symbolicly [sic] I want
 to let go of my past that is connecting with Nov. 22, 1963.'

Mrs Porter will keep the proceeds from the sale. In the letter she writes that the ring, which has a
 tiny engraving of a hammer and sickle, was bought by Oswald in Minsk in 
1961 shortly before the couple returned to the U.S.

The ring was left on the couple's bedside table when Oswald set out to kill the President.

Oswald was himself later shot and killed by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby while in police custody.

She had refused to speak publicly as the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination approaches. 

The wedding band was discovered in 2004 stuck in a manila folder at a Forth Worth law firm.

It was among the papers of Forrest Markward, a lawyer who represented Mrs Porter following the Kennedy assassination.

After several years of legal tussles, the ring was returned by post to Mrs Porter in an envelope marked 'Treasury Department Secret Service'.
