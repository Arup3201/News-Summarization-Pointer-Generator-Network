Liverpool centre-back Daniel Agger looks set to complete a £12million move to Barcelona, according to reports in Spain.

Spanish newspaper believe talks are ongoing between Catalan giants Barcelona and Liverpool over the possibility of Agger swapping Anfield for the Nou Camp.

Denmark international Agger has been stringently linked with a move to Barcelona during the last two summer transfer windows and it now looks as if he could finally seal a move to La Liga.

Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has identified the 29-year-old as the ideal man to replace long-serving centre-back Carles Puyol, who decided to hang up his boots at the end of last season, and form a parnership with Gerard Pique.

Agger's proposed move to Spain could be accelerated this week as Liverpool new boy Dejan Lovren is likely to replace the former Brondby defender.

Sport also report on Xavi's decision to stay at Barcelona for one more season before deciding the destination of his next club.
