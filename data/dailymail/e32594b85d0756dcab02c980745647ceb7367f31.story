He is something of a smooth operator in front of the camera.

Now Gary Lineker’s wife has let slip his secret – a luxury moisturiser beloved of supermodels and actresses.

The 53-year-old regularly applies Crème de la Mer to help him look as fresh-faced as his young wife.

Fresh-faced: Gay Lineker's wife Danielle, pictured right with the football pundit, has revealed the secrets of his skincare regime

Danielle Lineker – who at 34 is nearly two decades his junior – said she encourages the former England striker to raid her bathroom cabinet because he is too embarrassed to buy his own moisturiser.

But instead of using a cheaper brand such as Nivea – which costs just £1.15 for 30ml – he has developed a taste for the high-end anti-ageing cream, which sells at £105 for the same amount.

Mrs Lineker said: ‘Gary looks very young for his age. He has good genes and he looks after himself.

‘He moisturises, which is down to my influence. I give him anything I’ve got knocking around the cupboards.

‘He actually likes Crème de la Mer, the really thick expensive one. He has expensive tastes. It is meant to be the really good one, but I actually think they all do the same thing.’

Mrs Lineker made the revelation as she told the Daily Mail of her fears that the couple may soon be too old to have a child of their own.

They married in 2009, just three years after he was divorced by his wife of 20 years and mother to his sons, Michelle Cockayne.

Mrs Lineker, a Welsh model, has an 11-year-old daughter, Ella, from a previous relationship, while she is also stepmother to Lineker’s sons George, 22, Harry, 19, Tobias, 17, and Angus, 15.

But she says the couple have still not decided to have a child of their own. She said: ‘It is difficult enough with five kids, let alone with a new baby.

I’m 35 this year and time is ticking. I’d better get a move on if I am going to do it.’

Having established herself as a lingerie model, Mrs Lineker is now making her way as an actress.

Her screen debut is in teen film We Are The Freaks, which was in cinemas yesterday and is released on DVD on May 5.

At £105 for a 30ml pot, Crème de la Mer, right, is beyond the reach of most. But a string of celebrities swear by its anti-ageing powers.

Last month, actress Emma Watson shared a picture of her make-up bag, which contained a £42 stick of Crème de la Mer lipbalm.

And Jennifer Lopez, 44, reportedly covers her entire body in the cream.

Its secret is a ‘miracle broth’ of seaweed, vitamins and minerals that have been blasted by sound waves.
