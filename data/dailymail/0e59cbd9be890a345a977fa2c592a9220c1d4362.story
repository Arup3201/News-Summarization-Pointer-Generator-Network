Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was today called on to explain in more detail his knowledge of his niece's abuse

Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has refused to explain why he did not tell police about his brother’s sex abuse of his niece for nine years.

The republican leader claimed there was a lot of 'disinformation' as his younger brother Liam Adams awaited sentencing on November 5, in Belfast, for six years of rape attacks on his daughter Aine.

Liam Adams, 58, a one-time IRA commander, was yesterday convicted of attacking his child, who waived her right to anonymity to help bring him to justice.

The 40-year-old was attacked over a six-year period between 1977 and 1983 when she was aged between four and nine.

Gerry Adams pointed the finger at others when he was asked about when he first became aware of the assaults and why he did not report them in 1987.

He said: 'The police were aware over 20 years ago and there is a lot of disinformation being flung about in this issue.

'But let me say this, this has been and continues to be a huge ordeal for my family - we’re a very large family - especially for Aine, but for all members of my family. And I think people need to be given the space to come to terms with all of that.

'And if it was your family, you would want the same respect and space and privacy on these matters.'

During the trial Aine Adams gave graphic details of the abuse, which started when she was aged four.

The first rape she remembers took place while her mother was in hospital giving birth to her younger brother Conor in 1977.

The allegations about Liam Adams were first made public when his daughter took part in a television documentary in 2009.

On trial: Liam Adams, 58, arrives at Belfast Crown Court, where he was found guilty of sexually abusing his daughter Aine, who was hugged after the verdict yesterday

A short time later, Gerry Adams 
revealed his father Gerry Snr, a veteran IRA man, had physically and 
sexually abused members of his family.

He
was a witness in the first trial which collapsed earlier this year. He 
told Belfast Crown Court he confronted his brother when they met in 
Buncrana, Co Donegal, in 1987 and that Liam Adams had denied the abuse.

He then revealed his brother later confessed while they were out walking together in the rain in Dundalk, Co Louth, in 2000.

Gerry Adams was not called as a prosecution witness for the latest trial, which re-opened before a new jury panel last month.

Called
on to explain in more detail his knowledge of his niece’s abuse today 
and whether he has a relationship with her, Mr Adams refused to discuss 
the case further.

'I’m 
not going to talk about any of these matters beyond what I have said. It
has been a very difficult ordeal for everybody in the family,' he said.

Mr Adams was asked to explain why he 
did not warn authorities in Co Louth in 2003 that allegations had been 
made about his brother, who was working with children in Dundalk at the 
time.

Mr Adams went on to be elected for the Irish parliament for the area in 2011.

'I
have answered all of those questions in some detail, in a number of 
very extensive interviews. The trial is only over yesterday. I have said
what I need to say on all of that and we just need a bit of space to 
come to terms with that,' he said.

The Sinn Fein leader also rejected local media headlines which questioned whether he was fit for public office.

'Thankfully that isn’t in the hands of the Belfast Telegraph. That’s in the hands of citizens,' he said.

'I’m
very proud and privileged to represent the people of Louth and to 
represent Sinn Fein. I don’t take that for granted. It’s a huge honour 
to represent Sinn Fein. It’s a huge honour to have the support of your 
peers.

'All of these 
issues were rehearsed before the election and during the election 
campaign. So that’s where I get my mandate from - not from the Telegraph
in Belfast.'

When 
pressed for a second time about going to the police at an early 
opportunity, this time in 2000 after his brother confessed, Mr Adams 
refused to address the issue.

'Again I have answered that question in detail. You seem to be, with respect, just ignoring what I’m saying,' he said.

'Bear
with me, bear with me, let me finish the point I’m making. The point 
I’m making is that this is a traumatic ordeal for Aine, but for all of 
my family and we do need the space to deal with all of these matters and
that’s what I respectfully ask you to do.'

Mr
Adams was forced to answer the questions as he joined party colleagues 
at the front of the Dail parliament in Dublin to promote referendums 
taking place at the end of this week.

Irish
Taoiseach Enda Kenny said he would not comment on the Adams case but 
said everyone with information on abuse should know their 
responsibilities.

'I don’t want to comment on the personal circumstances that apply in any family,' Mr Kenny said.

'I have read the reports more than anybody else about this.

'Clearly,
the issue of paedophilia is something that is of such sensitivity and 
importance that where information about this is known, it should be made
known to the authorities, of course.'
