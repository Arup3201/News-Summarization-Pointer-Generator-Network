A heartbreaking video shows what it would be like for British children if civil war came to the UK.

The video, produced by the charity Save the Children, shows a second of each day in the year of a young child's life, to raise awareness of what millions of children in Syria are currently enduring.

It was released to commemorate the third anniversary of the Syrian conflict, which has seen more than 10,000 children killed, 1 million forced to leave the country, and a further 3 million internally displaced.

At the beginning of the commercial the girl is healthy and happy, enjoying her birthday. In the following year, depicted in the video, the UK enters into civil war and her family is forced to flee the country

She is shown playing with friends, doing her homework, on the swings - the pastimes of a happy childhood

The video was released by Save the Children to mark three years since the Syrian conflict began

The video begins with the little girl blowing out the candles on her birthday cake. She is healthy, surrounded by family and friends and smiling.

The girl is pictured playing dress-ups, cuddling a toy, playing in the park with her dad, and riding a bike.

At 20 seconds in to the video, the television news in the background starts talking about 'violent clashes' and neighbours speak aggressively about people who 'deserve to get shot'.

After 30 seconds, we hear a siren and the girl's parents are packing their car with possessions and fleeing their home.

The power goes off and the girl sneezes and is administered the last of her family's medicine supply by candlelight.

'Where are we?': The girl is bundled into the car and cowers in fear as she hears gunfire

The scenes in the video become more dire as the girl and her parents flee their home in the UK as the civil war worsens

The girl becomes sick, her hair falls out and her mother runs out of medicine with which to treat her

A bomb explodes behind her and she is bundled into a car. In the background we hear a news broadcast about 'rebel fighting in Richmond' and automatic gunfire.

The girl flees through smoke, lives homeless, and is chased terrified through the countryside.

We see her separated from her father at a checkpoint, before arriving, dishevelled and with a tear-stained face, at a refugee camp.

The video ends with the girl's mother holding out a metal bowl with a makeshift cake and single candle. She sings 'Happy Birthday' to her daughter who looks hollowly at the camera.

'Just because it isn't happening here doesn't mean it isn't happening,' it says onscreen.

Terror in her face: She screams and runs from people trying to chase her

The girl and her mother are separated from the girl's father at a checkpoint. She screams for him, but other people refuse to let him through

The haunting video ends with the girl's next birthday, celebrated with her mother in a refugee camp
