The English are known throughout the world for their eccentricity and behaviour that leaves many foreigners scratching their heads.

It was with this in mind that Tony Ray-Jones created a body of photographs documenting English customs and identity between 1966 and 1969. Humorous yet melancholy, these stills were a departure from anything else being produced at the time.

They quickly attracted the attention of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London where they were exhibited in 1969.

Tragically, in 1972, Ray-Jones died from leukaemia aged just 30. However, his short but prolific career had a lasting influence on the development of British photography from the 1970s through to the present day.

In 1970, Martin Parr, an 18-year-old photography student at Manchester Polytechnic, was introduced to Ray-Jones and was immediately inspired by his work.

Parr moved to Hebden Bridge in 1974 and produced The Non-Conformists, a series of images shot in black and white in and around the Calder Valley. This project started within two years of Ray-Jonesâ€™ death and demonstrates his legacy and influence.

Now the work of the two photographers is the subject of an exhibition at the National Media Museum in Bradford called 'Only In England'.
