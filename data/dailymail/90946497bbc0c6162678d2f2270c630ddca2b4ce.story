Sanchez and Falcao played a huge part in River Plate's 2008 title winning season under the guidance of now Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger recently backed his £30million signing to become a main man at the Emirates this season.

He said: 'He (Sanchez) is a striker. He’s a good finisher, who made a great impression in Italy, I saw him there and he was really outstanding.

‘I like the fact he can play left, right, up front and that’s why I went for him. Will he give is an extra dimension? Yes, I think so, And I hope I’m right.’
