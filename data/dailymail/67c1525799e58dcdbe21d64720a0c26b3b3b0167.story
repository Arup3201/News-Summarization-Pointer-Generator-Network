A mother who was diagnosed with aggressive cancer at the same time as her husband when their daughter was just 18 months old has lost her three-year battle with the disease.

Elisa Bond, 39, from Brooklyn, New York, passed away on Wednesday, prompting her husband, Nathan - who is now in remission from stage 3 colon cancer - to write a heartfelt note on Facebook.

'It is with profound sorrow that I write these words. My light and love Elisa passed away yesterday afternoon,' the father to four-year-old Sadie wrote on the Team Bond page.

He continued: 'I am left with infinite gratitude for having been blessed, as so many were, with having my life forever brightened by her love, laughter, beauty, humor, intelligence and extraordinary strength.

'She fought for every moment of life with unparalleled bravery and astonishing grace.'

Mrs Bond was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in March 2011 after getting a lump on her chest checked out.

The news came shortly after Mr Bond discovered he had a tumor in his intestine on Valentine's Day.

Doctors estimated the couple, who married in 2005, had around five years to live and both were forced to quit their jobs as they underwent urgent treatment.

Mrs Bond worked in real estate after trying out as an actress while Mr Bond was a painter.

'I
 wanted to grow old with my husband and care for our daughter. Now I'm just hoping for a miracle'

They created a website to update friends and family on their progress and branded themselves Team Bond.

Thousands of dollars in donations poured in, to help the young parents cover medical expenses not paid 
for by their insurance company.

‘I
 wanted to grow old with my husband and care for our daughter,’ Mrs Bond said at the time.

‘Now I'm just hoping for a miracle.’

Eight months later that miracle came when doctors told Mrs Bond that surgery, chemotherapy and radiation had worked.

Support: The couple said they had been overwhelmed with the kindness people had shown

Mr Bond was also on the road to recovery.

However, the respite was short lived and Mrs Bond's cancer returned and spread to other organs including her brain.

In January 2013, Mrs Bond wrote on her blog page titled, Family "Bond"ing Time: 'S*** news about my brain. 

'Six old lesions grew. Now a total of ten.We have to attack the cerebral spinal fluid directly.

'Freaked out, scared, angry, sad, worried and still positive.'

Despite the young mother's positivity, her cancer treatment ultimately failed.

Decision: When her hair began to fall out after chemotherapy treatment Mrs Bond decided to shave her head

Beautiful: Mrs Bond described her first week after treatment as 'terrible' and said she had felt sick and tired

Already the $25,000 has target has been surpassed thanks to supportive friends, family and complete strangers.

Mr Bond previously said he had been overwhelmed with the kindness people had shown to him and his wife.

'It's inspiring to us the outpouring of 
love from everybody else and for some reason we are inspiring other 
people as well - all we have done is get cancer.

'I think we'll take away not so much 
when we are well - which we will be - is not the illness but the 
outpouring of love from perfect strangers literally all over the world.

'That's what we're going to tell Sadie about when she asked about our cancer later on.'

'It is so strange to me that something so horrible could bring about so many blessings.'
