Travellers are being warned to beware of online scams after a fake Qantas Facebook account that was created to try and get users to share their financial details for the chance to win a $1500 travel voucher.

The scam used the airlines' official logo and those who clicked the page were taken to an imitation Facebook page which asked for personal details.

Anyone clicking on the link was urged to 'like' it and then share it with their friends. 

This is the fake Qantas Facebook account which is being investigated 

A spokesman for Qantas told Daily Mail Australia: 'We are aware that some customers have received fake Facebook messages masquerading as a Qantas birthday promotion. 

'Customers that click on the message are taken to an imitation Qantas Facebook page where they are asked to provide personal details.

'This is a scam and has nothing to do with Qantas. Our campaigns are always run from our authenticated Facebook page (identified by its authorised blue tick), or through the official Qantas website.

The airline says the scam has 'nothing to do with them' and told customers not to give out their details

'Individuals who encounter the page are advised not to provide personal details, if unsure we encourage you to get in touch with Qantas to confirm before divulging any information.

'Qantas has already had a number of the scam pages removed.

'Facebook have been advised of the scam and are investigating.' 

The promotion claims to be a 'birthday' celebration — even though Qantas does not mark its anniversary until November.
