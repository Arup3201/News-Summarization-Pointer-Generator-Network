Loss: 17-year-old George Verrier died after suffering head injuries in a brawl. An ambulance called to help him failed to turn up

An investigation was launched last night after paramedics confessed they were called to help a fatally injured teenager but did not turn up.

Police asked ambulance service controllers to send help when they discovered George Verrier, 17, dazed and bleeding after a mass brawl.

But they did not respond for almost an hour and half, during which time friends claimed officers told him to catch a bus to hospital.

Instead he staggered half a mile to a friend’s house where he was discovered unconscious the next morning. He was airlifted to hospital where he died nine hours later.

Last night the apprentice electrician’s stunned family demanded answers as police launched an internal inquiry.

Relative Lesley Herron, 58, said his family are ‘living a nightmare’.

Speaking at his great-aunt's house, she said: ‘We feel he could have been saved. We don't know the facts yet, but we feel he could have been saved.

‘We want answers. The family wants answers. We just want to know if he could have been saved.

‘If we find that he could have survived and we could have had the chance to see him married with children, that would be awful. But we don't know what is to be.

‘I don't know how we will cope. It will add to our burden of grief.’

Cousin Paul Houston said: ‘We were told that George was told to make his own way to accident and emergency.

‘Surely that should not be the case if someone has a knock on the head? We want answers. It is such a loss.

‘George was such a lovely gentle boy. He went to sleep and never woke up.’

Paramedics did not respond for almost an hour and a half after Mr Varrier was injured in the fight. Friends also claimed that police officers told him to catch a bus to hospital

George was seriously injured when fighting broke out among dozens of teenagers after a 16th birthday party at a £500,000 home in suburban Bromley, South-East London.

Many of those at the party were students at the renowned Brit School of performing arts in Croydon, whose former pupils include singers Adele and Jessie J.

Police officers discovered the teenager bleeding from a face wound and gave him first aid when they were called to the scene shortly after midnight on Sunday.

Friends claimed they told George to ‘get a bus’ to hospital but he instead chose to walk home, clearly not realising the seriousness of his injuries.

With no ambulance to take him to hospital, Mr Verrier staggered half a mile to a friend's house, dazed and bleeding, and where he was discovered unconscious the next morning

But sources revealed officers also contacted London Ambulance Service (LAS) and requested help, but no-one came.

An LAS spokeswoman confirmed that staff were called to an ‘assault’ at 1am to help a patient who was ‘fully conscious’.

But she added that they were ‘unable to respond’ and were stood down at 2.20am.

Yesterday, George’s heart-broken family and friends said they were still coming to terms with their sudden loss.

Paying tribute to ‘gorgeous George’, Miss Herron said his family are paralysed with grief.

She said: ‘It is crazy, we are living in a nightmare, the whole family is having a nightmare but we know we are not going to wake up.

‘He was a precious boy, precious to the family. There are no words to describe what his father has lost. He was his only son.’

Mr Verrier's family have now demanded answers into what happened and police have launched an internal inquiry

The family are coping with a second death in less than nine months after George's grandmother Jean Verrier died on Christmas Day, aged 81.

Miss Herron said: ‘George was the apple of her eye.

‘She had developed pneumonia, maybe it was better for her to be taken at Christmas than for her to have survived and seen this. It would have killed her.

‘His father had cancer a few years back and he came through all of that with George by his side helping.

‘Even as a young lad he was like a man. He was a darling boy. It is like this happened to an angel, he had such a good soul.

‘It has destroyed us all, we are never going to get over this. I don't know how we are going to put one foot forward in all of this.

‘We read about it and bleed for people who this has happened too, and now it's us bleeding. It is a total tragedy that should never have happened.’

Other relatives of the young victim revealed he was an organ donor, with one saying: ‘Three people walked out of that hospital because of him.’

George's great-aunt Norma Verrier, 79, broke down as she told of her heartache at his death.

She said: ‘He was a beautiful boy, he was gorgeous.

‘This is the worst thing that has ever happened to our family. He was a dear boy, he was no trouble.

‘It's a nightmare that you see on TV and hear about on the radio but it's other people's nightmare – now it's ours.

‘He was such a sweetheart. He loved his family - his mum, dad, cousins - and his friends.’

His cousin Louis Verrier said: ‘The family are too upset to speak at the moment and want some peace and quiet.

‘They feel as you would imagine they would. They just lost their baby.’

Friend Sam Abbabiyi said: 'George was a good friend of mine. He was not the sort of person who went looking for trouble. I am certain he would not have started it.

‘He was a really good guy. It is very sad what has happened.’

Mr Verrier was seriously injured after a fight among dozens of teenagers after a 16th birthday outside this house in Bromley, South East London

The young victim, a former pupil at Sir Roger Manwood’s School, in Sandwich, Kent, had two older sisters, Jessica, 23, and Nancy, 21.

Friends have placed flowers, pictures, a Crystal Palace football shirt and messages on a tree at a green space near where he suffered his fatal injuries.

A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said managers have launched an internal inquiry and will also co-operate fully with police.

She said: ‘We can confirm that we were called to reports of an assault in Blenheim Road at 1.01am on Sunday morning.

‘The patient was reported to have been fully conscious but we were unable to respond at the time and were subsequently cancelled at around 2.20am before we were able to attend the scene.

‘We are now looking into the circumstances of what happened.’

A Met spokesman said: ‘The Met has made a voluntary referral to the IPCC to assess the actions of the officers who attended the scene.’

An IPCC spokeswoman said the Met will carry out its own investigation into contact between its officers and George before his death.

She said that if any ‘conduct matters’ come to light during the inquiry then they will reconsider that decision.
