A serial rapist is believed to be behind a terrifying attack on a 28-year-old Australian woman in Bali.

The woman, from Perth, had a knife held to her throat during the assault in the early hours of Saturday morning at a rented villa on the island.

She told police she had been forced to open a safe before being raped while seven other members of her family, including 
children, slept nearby in the property.

A spokesman for the local police force 
said the robbery was carried out by a number of people, who entered the 
villa by jumping on a boundary wall.

Officers said her description of the man who allegedly raped her matches that of
a suspect in previous attacks on the beautiful island, which is popular with western tourists.

Three iPads, two mobile phones and about Â£100 worth of local currency in cash was stolen during the break-in, according to 9News.

The attack is the latest of a number of violent assaults on western tourists on Bali, which is a province of Indonesia.

These include an attack by a gang on a woman in March in Kuta as she made her way home from a party and the stabbing of an Australian man in January as he fought off armed robbers.

The attacks have led to concerns over the potential impact on Bali's vital tourism industry.

The island had been rebuilding its image following the terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005 - with a steady year on year increase in visitors from abroad.

In recent years China has displaced Japan as the second-largest nationality for tourists to Bali, while Australia still tops the list.
