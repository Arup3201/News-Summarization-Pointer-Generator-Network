The blood was washed away years ago and the crime-scene tape has long since disappeared.

Yet there’s still something eerily familiar about the five stone steps leading up to the elegant, Mediterranean-style mansion, bathed in Miami Beach sunshine and flanked by palm trees blowing in an ocean breeze.

This is the spot where celebrated fashion designer Gianni Versace was gunned down by a serial killer, made famous by countless newspaper photographs and worldwide TV broadcasts. And now the house could be yours for a snip.

Spectacular setting: The view of the South Beach skyline from the tiled rooftop includes a glimpse of the pool and courtyard below

Central courtyard: The richly tiled floor and airy arches have featured in dozens of glossy magazine spreads over the years. From the roof the blue of the Atlantic and a fringe of palm trees can once again be glimpsed in the distance

Private dip: The mosaic pool is lined with 24-carat gold tiles

Soaking up the sun: Loungers await buyers who want to top up their tan by the pool

After initially being offered for sale
last year at $125million (around £80million) it is being put up for 
auction with a starting price of just $25million (£16million).

But
if you get past the former murder scene to the majestic arch of the 
huge front door, a peep through the keyhole – depending on your taste – 
might reveal even greater horrors in store.

Infamous: Versace was shot dead on the steps of the South Beach mansion by Andrew Cunanan who then killed himself before police closed in

Taste free: The Empire Suite features spectacularly clashing styles and a myriad of colours which are incompatible with a restful night's sleep

Lavish detail: The walls of the Empire Suite features handpainted murals of musicians in an exotic setting. The suite itself is opposite Versace's old bedroom

Who could possibly live here, in a house where the master bedroom resembles a cross between the Sistine Chapel and a tart’s boudoir? Surely a man with such genius for helping women to look beautiful wouldn’t have furnished his home thus? And who might want to lash out a fortune on a place where the neighbours include a constant stream of Versace worshippers and celebrity-hunting ghouls posing for pictures at the gates?

Naturally, those involved in the sale are quick to point out that Versace was slain outside the mansion, not in, when crazed attacker Andrew Cunanan struck in July 1997 before killing himself as a police search closed in.

Gleaming: A bath in the Mosaic Suite, left, and a shower in the Moroccan wash room

Plush: Living quarters include the the Moroccan Suite which is crammed full of the familiar features of North African design translated to a Miami beach setting

Grandiose: The Villa Suite was once Versace's bedroom. Sprawling accommodation includes feature pillars and a boldly tiled floor. There are also a number of balconies

The Fisher Auction Company still hopes the Italian designer’s legacy will be enough to attract a legion of bidders when the house goes up for auction on September 17.

Versace spent $33million on renovations after buying the run-down 1930s mansion and a dilapidated hotel next door in 1992.

The 23,000 sq ft property now boasts ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a 54ft mosaic pool lined with 24-carat gold tiles, and an open-air courtyard.

It has gold-plated bathroom fixtures, of course; plus mosaic floors and frescos he had custom made. Although high walls block traffic sounds from the busy road outside, 1116 Ocean Drive  has panoramic views of the sea from a rooftop observatory.

The Versace family sold the house in 2000. It became a private club, then operated as a boutique hotel until earlier this year before a bankruptcy court appointed Fisher to put the property up for auction.

New owners kept many of the more elegant Versace features but furnished the rooms ‘uniquely’. That furniture – including beds so large they need custom-made sheets – will be part of the sale. The mansion’s provenance comes free of charge.

The Mosaic Suite is also known as the Madonna room as it was where the singer stayed when she visited: It features an intricate floor with a mosaic face

Time to relax: A decorative clock on a counter in the 'man cave' room
