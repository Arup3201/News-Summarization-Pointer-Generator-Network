A thief who stole lobster and ice cream from Marks & Spencer walked free yesterday after insisting he only took ‘essential’ items.

A court heard how Corey Thomas, 24, was temporarily homeless and had not eaten for two days when he walked into the company’s flagship London store in Oxford Street.

Thomas was seen picking out a Canadian lobster, some milk and a tub of ice cream, with a total value of £23.98, Westminster magistrates’ court was told.

He was clutching the goods when he was confronted in the street by a store security guard.

Thomas was detained after shoving the guard and breaking  his earpiece.

Chairman of the bench Stevie Dee said: ‘Why lobster? It could be a sandwich if you’re that hungry.’

Jero Pipiazza, representing the defendant, replied: ‘The items were not luxury items – they were essentials.’

Malachy Pakenham, prosecuting, said Thomas was seen 'selecting a Canadian lobster and removing the security tag.

'He then picked up some milk and a tub of ice cream.'

Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Thomas was then followed as he clutched the goods, valued at £23.98, and stepped out into the street.

He was challenged outside by a security guard, before being detained after shoving him and breaking his earpiece.

Mr
Pipiazza told the court Thomas was temporarily homeless and had not 
eaten for two days when the theft took place at around 6.30pm on July 23
this year.

He added that 
Thomas had previously studied cookery at Shoreditch College and was due 
to start an apprenticeship in 'cleaning and caretaking' at Hackney 
Council.

Sentencing him Ms Dee told him: 'We're giving you a chance now.

'You have pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, cooperated with the police, and we are encouraged by your apprenticeship you are due to start.

'But we have to warn you that if you continue to offend the court will not be so lenient in the future.'

Thomas, of Hackney, East London, was 
sentenced to a £55 fine or a single day’s imprisonment, which was deemed
already served, after admitting theft.
