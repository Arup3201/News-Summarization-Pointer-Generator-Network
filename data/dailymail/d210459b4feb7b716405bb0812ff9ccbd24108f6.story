Danny Mills has heaped more pressure on Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce by claiming the former England international is 'not a great coach, not a great tactician and not a great motivator.'

Pearce is under-fire at the City Ground with Forest winning just two of their last 20 matches ahead of Saturday's clash with rivals Derby.

The former England Under 21 boss started well at Forest, winning five of his first seven league fixtures but the club now sit 13th in the Championship table.

However, Mills, who played under Pearce at Manchester City, believes people are quick to work the 52-year-old out.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Mills said: 'Pearce always starts well but goes off the boil. He is very predictable. After 10 games people work him out. 

'He comes in, everyone says "wow, it's Stuart Pearce, legend! Psycho" and all of that and he has that instant respect.

'He gets teams going but after a while, players aren't stupid, they're not naive and they start to suss him out. He doesn't have the depth of football ability to back it up.

'Actually, he is not a great coach, he's not a great tactician, he's not a great motivator and he struggles with big players who question his authority.'
