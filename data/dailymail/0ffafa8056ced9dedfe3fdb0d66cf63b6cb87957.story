After escaping into the world of spiritual healing, an Australian couple made an unambiguous move to leave their comfortable lifestyle to run a retreat in the Amazon Jungle of Peru.

It was a life-changing experience for Julian, 30 and Angela Moran, 31, when they discovered an ancient psychedelic plant medicine called ‘ayahuasca’, which is used to heal extensive mental, emotional and physical problems and produces a 'hallucinogenic experience'.

Sprawled across 490 hectares of rainforest, the Refugio Altiplano Healing Centre offers tourists a natural paradise and the perfect environment to practice Ayahuasca Shamanism and natural medicine healing within a ceremonial setting.

Leaving behind their normal working jobs in engineering and mining, the Perth couple work full time at the centre in the north-eastern city of Iquitos, which is only reachable via a 40-kilometre boat ride.

Julian and Angela Moran left their comfortable lifestyle in Perth to run a retreat in the Amazon Jungle of Peru

Walking away from the life of comfort, there are limited facilities, a petrol generator used for power for about five hours per night, reception drops in and out and no hot water.

But the pair felt obligated to inject ‘money, energy and love’ into the popular tourism industry after the previous owner passed away.

‘We felt so fortunate to have had the gift of transformation that we couldn’t bear to think of ‘The Refugio’ being shut down and denying others the same opportunity,’ Mr Moran told Daily Mail Australia.

'As we are from the mining and resources sector we are passionate about helping those from our industry [among others] who are under extensive pressure from work and the related high stress. 

'We were living in Perth for over 20 years but we feel strongly about this line of work and saw the positive results in ourselves and others and felt that we could provide the safety, comfort and support to those wishing this experience for themselves.'

The mind-expanding tea contains a compound called DMT, which is illegal in most countries, causing controversy and concerns around the globe after reports of several-related deaths.

It comes after British teenager Henry Miller was found dead after taking the  drug in a tribal ritual in Columbia and his body was dumped on a lonely dirt road last year.

But Mr Moran ensures the centre’s professional supervision, authenticity and highly qualified staff offering a safe environment distinguishes it from the deceitful operators.

'The class of ‘drugs’ that ayahuasca belongs to is known as ‘psychedelics’. But what most people don’t understand is that they are non-addictive and non-toxic,’ Mr Moran said.

‘Our services provide you with a qualified shaman of high integrity, the medicine is authentic and absent of additives so you are safe, controlled and supervised environment – you are not at risk.

‘The fatalities have occurred when one or more of the above has been compromised.’

Leaving behind their comfortable jobs in engineering and mining, Julian and Angela wanted to pursue a career help those who are suffering from extensive mental and emotional and physical problems

Given the potential for ‘burn out’ in highly pressurised work environments, ayahuasca may assist an individual in the avoidance of problematic thinking and overloading

‘The medicine’ is known for its ability to heal extensive mental and emotional, and physical problems

Mr Moran said there is a sewage system for their flushable toilets - which is one of the luxuries out there

Mr Moran said it creates a hallucinogenic state that is 'like being awake inside a dream'.

'The chemical responsible for this experience is DMT. It is involved in birth, sleep (dreaming) and death, which is why it is unnecessarily controversial,' Mr Moran explains.

'DMT is produced by the human brain and used by it daily - For it to be illegal, is illogical.

'I believe there is a very close relationship between dreaming and the state that is created by the ingestion of ayahuasca.'

As hundreds of tourists from around the world travel to the Peruvian jungle to seek for ‘healing and introspection’, the drug has also helped people with certain types of ailments.

It was originally Mr Moran’s background in Anthropology that first interested him in medicinal plants, but this was compounded when he experienced significant relief from depression, bi-polar disorder and alcoholism through the pursuit of natural remedies. 

‘The brew is currently being rediscovered by Western medicine, with extensive anecdotal evidence suggesting its application to conditions such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, alcoholism and addiction, physical illness and mental and emotional problems,’ he explains.

‘I have seen excellent results in people suffering from depression, PTSD, anxiety and other mental illness. It is also effective in physical ailments, such as IBS, digestive issues, skin conditions etc.

‘We have also seen great results with eating disorders - both obesity and anorexia.’

The Refugio Altiplano Healing Centre is a natural paradise for healing and introspection.

The course of accommodation ranges from three nights and two ceremonies, 12 days and seven ceremonies to even a month long.

It costs USD$160 per night to stay with us, or USD$1500 for a 12 Day Retreat or $100 per night if people want to stay long term (30 night minimum).

The centre provides healthy, balanced meals, accommodation in jungle-styled two storey houses and can accommodate up to four people.

Mr Moran said ayahuasca shamanism refers to the use of ayahuasca to attain a modified state of consciousness, during which participants are able to process trauma and repressed memories.

Given the potential for ‘burn out’ in highly pressurised work environments, ayahuasca may assist an individual in the avoidance of problematic thinking and overloading.

‘Our guests often include people who want to break their reliance on pharmaceutical drugs. They are sick of dealing with the symptoms, and want to address the root-cause of their problem,' his wife Angela said.

Before the ceremony, the user will usually fast for more than five hours prior to consuming the medicine and there are negative side effects that may strike during the experience.

‘The ayahuasca vine is a purgative. It is a necessary component of the medicine, as it allows for the cleansing of the body,' Mr Moran said.

'Physical 'purges' include vomiting and diarrhoea, while the emotional purges include yawning, crying, shaking, sweating. In all cases, it allows your body to expel toxins, and energy, that you do not need.

‘It is not uncommon for people to feel as though a weight has been lifted following a powerful purge.

‘In the West, vomiting is reflective of being 'sick'. Here, [in relation to ayahuasca] it is referred to as 'getting well'.’

Guests pay $US1500 for a 12-day retreat, which includes seven ceremonies and accommodation

The retreat includes seven ceremonies with ‘strict processes governing the pouring of medicine, the blessings and protection of the room’

Once the tea is consumed after being made by brewing two Amazonian plants in water on high heat for many hours, guests may experience a range of affects where they enter an 'altered state of consciousness'.

‘They may experience the presence of something or someone or 'other worldly' and may also experience their 'higher self',’ he said.

‘The ayahuasca experience has been described as being like having “the best doctor, the best psychologist and the best Priest at your beck and call”,’ Mr Moran said.

‘Now, the ayahuasca experience lasts 6-10 hours. Compared to costs of conventional therapy via psychologists or psychotherapists, not including medication, these costs are small.

'While we have a small percentage of repeat guests, the vast majority use the medicine in a ceremonial setting with us over the course of a number of days, and return to their lives happier and healthier and more in control of their lives.'

The retreat includes seven ceremonies with ‘strict processes governing the pouring of medicine, the blessings and protection of the room’.

Other activities include a tour around the local villages, swim in the river, go on jungle hikes, visit botanical garden and use the centre’s ‘sweat lodge’ inspired sauna.

While Peru is a long way from home, Julian and Angela encourage Australians to take control of their lives and make the journey for themselves.

'This is an ancient practice and allows people to connect with themselves on a level that is not available in ordinary, waking consciousness,' Mr Moran said.

'I would encourage people to research why substances within this class of 'drugs' are illegal, before discounting them as valid avenues of exploration in the search for a healthier life. 

'This medicine provides healing, insight, direction and purpose.'
