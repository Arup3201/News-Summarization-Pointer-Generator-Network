Chinese ships are ramming Vietnamese 
vessels and spraying sailors with water cannons in a clash over plans to
 drill for oil in disputed waters.

Several
 boats have been damaged and six people on one vessel have been injured,
 said officials in Hanoi, with neither side showing any signs of backing
 down.

Vietnamese vessels 
are trying to stop China placing a $1billion oil rig off their country's
 coast. The say they want a peaceful solution, but a top official warned
 'all restraint has a limit'.

The
 clash has been continuing for several days since a Chinese flotilla of 
military and civilian ships moved into the disputed area of the South 
China Sea on May 1.

Vietnam 
promptly dispatched marine police and fishery protection vessels to the 
area but they were harassed as they approached, said Ngo Ngoc Thu, vice 
commander of Vietnam's coast guard.

He
 said Vietnam had not carried out any offensive actions of its own in 
waters close to the rig, which is around 140 miles off the Vietnamese 
coast.

'Our maritime police
 and fishing protection forces have practiced extreme restraint, we will
 continue to hold on there,' said commander Ngo.

'But if (the Chinese ships) continue to ram into us, we will respond with similar self-defense.'

He
 showed video at a news conference of Chinese ships ramming into 
Vietnamese ones and firing at them with high-powered water cannons. 
Attacks had occurred repeatedly over the past three days, he said.

Vietnam
 has sent no naval vessels to the area, despite the presence of Chinese 
navy warships, but the standoff raises the possibility that more serious
 clashes could yet break out.

'No
 shots have been fired yet,' said a Vietnamese navy official, who could 
not be identified because he was not authorised to speak to media. 
'Vietnam won't fire unless China fires first.'

Another
 Vietnamese official, who also preferred to remain anonymous, said that 
Vietnam's ships were outnumbered by the Chinese flotilla. He said the 
ships were trying to stop the rig from 'establishing a fixed position'.

Western
 analysts have called China's stationing of the oil rig one of its most 
provocative steps yet in a gradual campaign of asserting its sovereignty
 in the South China Sea. China claims almost the entire sea, rejecting 
rival claims from Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.

Chinese
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying insists the rig, owned by 
Chinese state-run oil company CNOOC, is in China's territorial waters 
and therefore drilling is 'normal and legal.'

'The
 disruptive activities by the Vietnamese side are in violation of 
China's sovereign rights,' she said. China had previously said no 
foreign ships would be allowed within three miles of the rig.

In
 a strongly worded statement in Washington on Tuesday, State Department 
spokeswoman Jen Psaki called China's action 'provocative and unhelpful 
to the maintenance of peace and stability in the region.'

Asked
 about the U.S. statement, Ms Hua hit back. 'we want to tell the U.S. 
that the U.S. has no right to make irresponsible and unwarranted remarks
 on China's sovereign rights,' she said.

Vietnam has limited leverage in dealing with its giant neighbour and vital economic partner.

While
 it is no longer as isolated as it once was, as once of the world's last
 few Communist countries it can't expect much diplomatic help from 
powerful friends.

It appears likely to try to rally regional support against China's actions.

Jonathan
 London, a Vietnam expert at the City University of Hong Kong, said the 
country had basically found itself caught between a rock and a hard 
place.

'China seems intent 
on putting down its footprint squarely in contested waters and force 
Hanoi's hand,' he said. 'It appears a critical juncture has occurred and
 one would expect Hanoi to be weighing its options.

'Hanoi's
 back is against the wall, though China's policies - which according to 
virtually everyone except China are baseless legally - have brought 
about this situation.'

China
 occupied the Paracel Islands 40 years ago, and 74 soldiers from the 
then U.S.-backed South Vietnamese Army died trying to take them back.

The Vietnamese and Chinese navies clashed again in 1988 in the disputed Spratly Islands, leaving 64 Vietnamese sailors dead.

In 1992, China awarded a contract to U.S. energy company Crestone to explore for oil and gas in the Spratly Islands.

Vietnam protested the move. Two years later, Vietnam's navy forced the company's oil rigs to leave the area.
