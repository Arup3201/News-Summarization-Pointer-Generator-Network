Police in Florida say a 19-year-old Tampa man has turned an innocent stuffed horse into his personal sex toy while shopping at Walmart.

Sean Johnson was arrested Tuesday at the big-box store located in Brooksville and charged with indecent exposure and criminal mischief after Walmart employees told police that the 19-year-old had been spotted pleasuring himself with the help of a stuffed animal.

Johnson was taken to the Hernando County Jail but was later released after posting $1,500 bail.

Horse whisperer: Sean Johnson, 19, was charged with indecent exposure and criminal mischief after Walmart store cameras caught him defiling a stuffed horse toy 

Not your average toy: Police say Johnson picked out a horse toy (similar to the one pictured) from the clearance section, took it to the bedding department and used it to pleasure himself 

According to Johnson’s arrest report, the suspect was caught on surveillance cameras just before 3pm Tuesday acting suspiciously.

The teenager reportedly removed a brown, black and red stuffed horse from a clearance shelf and walked over to the bedding department, where police say he proceeded to pleasure himself using the toy, TBO.com reported.

The arrest report cited by The Smoking Gun described in graphic detail how the 19-year-old man allegedly pulled out his genitals so he could ‘hump the stuffed horse utilizing short fast movements’ until he achieved satisfaction.

Store cameras then captured Johnson placing the defiled horsey smeared with bodily fluids on top of a packaged comforter set.

The 19-year-old then took off running but was apprehended a short time later.

When questioned by police, Johnson reportedly came clean about his bizarre amorous encounter with an inanimate plaything. 

Disgusting: Johnson later replaced the defiled stuffed animal covered in bodily fluids on a shelf at the Brooksville Walmart and ran off, but was quickly caught 

‘I did unmentionables to a stuffed animal,’ Johnson said in a written statement. ‘The officer put it into perspective of what would happen if somebody would pick it up and use it.

'I did not think of it the way he put it and I so feel like I did a horrible act.’

The defiled toy and all the items it came in contact with had to be disposed of after being deemed contaminated and unsalable.
