Taking a break from another punishing work out, 'Human Barbie' Valeria Lukyanova has shared some more snaps of herself looking fresh-faced and cosmetic-free. 

The 28-year-old Ukrainian model, who 
prides herself on having similar features and proportions to the plastic Mattel 
doll, has shared a series of Facebook photos that show her wearing little to no make-up and going without her doll-like contact lenses.

Earlier this month Valeria 
revealed what she looks like under her heavy layers of make-up for the first time, in a 
series of candid selfies.

Gym snap: Showing off her thin frame, Valeria's hair is scraped back from her face in a high ponytail while wearing a bright pink crop top

Gym break: Valeria's hair was styled in a cute bun and was wearing a cropped black exercise top with a plunging cleavage

On Wednesday she was at it again, uploaded two pictures of a gym visit only hours apart, and seemingly taking the time for an outfit change in between shots.

Showing off the extremely thin frame that she puts down to her 'breatharian' lifestyle, Valeria's hair is scraped back 
from her face in a high ponytail while wearing a bright pink crop top.

Breatharianism, is a cult that believes food - and possibly water - are not necessary for life. Breatharians claim they can exist on 'cosmic micro-food'.

'In recent weeks I have not been hungry at all; I'm hoping it's the final stage before I can subsist on air and light alone,' she claimed in an interview in February.

The practice has been criticised as potentially lethal pseudoscience, and several practitioners have reportedly died of starvation. None have submitted themselves for comprehensive medical testing.

Somehow, in spite of her claims that she lives on air and light alone, Valeria has managed to find the energy to work out frequently.

Earlier in the day, she posed looking unflustered next to an exercise bench which had a towel laid out across it - suggesting she had been working out using the equipment. At this point, her hair was styled in a neat bun and she was wearing a cropped black exercise top with a plunging cleavage.

It's harder to tell how much make-up she is wearing in these photos as they are taken further away than her last, more intimate photos.

But, her gym-wear and make-up (if she's wearing any at all!) is starkly different to her normal  ensemble.

An hour before she uploaded her first gym picture, Valeria appeared to be topping up her tan while getting in the mood for exercise by wearing a sporty visor.

Uncovered: 'Human Barbie' Valeria Lukyanova has finally revealed what she looks like under her heavy layers of make-up in new candid selfies

In one of the photos taken earlier this month, Valeria strikes a pose in a bathroom in a printed crop top and tiny denim shorts.

Her platinum blonde hair falls to one side, and while she is perhaps wearing a little bit of make-up, she looks uncharacteristically natural.

Her incredibly slender waist and protruding ribs, however, are a cause for concern.

Her drastically slimmed down figure is apparent as well in another selfie she posted, this time wearing a hot pink bra and underwear.

In the photo, Valeria is turned to the side, and her stomach appears concave.

Below the image, she posted a link to a work-out video starring Instagram sensation Jennifer Selter, who is known for her pert derriere and passion for fitness.

Valeria recently courted controversy 
for claiming that interracial couples are the reason behind an increase in cosmetic surgery because they are 'making the human race uglier'.

‘Remember how many beautiful women there were in the 1950s and 1960s, without any surgery?' she said in an interview with GQ.

'And now, thanks to degeneration, we have this. A Russian marries an Armenian, they have a kid, a cute girl, but she has her dad's nose. She goes and files it down a little, and it's all good.'

Her comments sparked a furious 
outrage among readers, but Valeria looks none the wiser in another 
selfie she posted in which she wears a black and white sports bra.

The blonde looks pensively downward, with earphones in her ears and minimal make-up on her face.

She strikes a similar pose in another photo posted yesterday, which sees her sitting in a car with a grey sweater on.

With her eyes looking down, it's difficult to see whether she's wearing her Barbie-inspired contacts, but her make-up looks considerably less caked-on than usual.
