Ravel Morrisson's hopes of securing a move away from West Ham were significantly enhanced yesterday when three charges of assault against him were withdrawn at Manchester Crown Court.

Morrison, 21, could now be on the verge of signing a pre-contract with Lazio for the end of the season.

He is also pursuing more immediate options in the Premier League, with West Ham anxious to let him go in the current transfer window.

Charges that Morrison assaulted his ex-girlfriend, Reah Mansoor, and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, were withdrawn after his defence team produced CCTV footage which showed the alleged assault outside a Manchester nightclub last July did not take place.

Reah Mansoor also withdrew her statement alleging Morrison later assaulted her outside her home while there was ‘reluctance’ from her mother to proceed with the alleged assault on her.

Morrison last night played for West Ham Under 21s in their league game against Everton in Southport.
