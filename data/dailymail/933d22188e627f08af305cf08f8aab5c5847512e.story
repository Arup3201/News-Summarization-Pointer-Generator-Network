Police are hunting the owners of a 'drunk' dog that clamped its jaws around a cow's face for ten minutes after its owner goaded it into a violent frenzy.

The sozzled Staffordshire bull terrier brutally attacked the helpless steer, on Midsummer Common, Cambridge,  after it staggered away from its owners - a man and woman, also described as inebriated.

A fierce tussle ensued as the cow attempted to trample its canine attacker with its hooves in a bid to loosen the iron grip.

As the dog's owners simply looked on, a passer by eventually caught the rampaging animal before tying it to a lead he had in his pocket.

A good graze: The unnamed cow was left with a large gash on its face, but it has been treated and its owner said it is 'well and calm'

Now Cambridgeshire Constabulary want 
to find the owners after they were called to reports of a dog that 
'appeared to be drunk' attacking a cow on Wednesday evening.

The suspected dog, thought to be 
called Spike, is said to have been baited to attack the cattle which are
famous for having roamed the common undisturbed for hundreds of years.

Vet Angelika von Heimendahl, who owns the cattle, said: 'I think the owners of the dog must not have realised what would happen, but it is stupid, cruel and irresponsible.

'The steer had lacerations to its face. The dog bit one steer’s leg then attached itself to the other steer’s face. It was really dangerous.'

Anna Tristram, 30, who was running on the common when the attack took place, said: 'It was really horrible. I thought at first the cows were 
attacking the dog but then we saw the dog has clamped on to the face of a
cow and was just dangling on it for about 10 minutes.

Angry: Vet Angelika von Heimendahl, who owns the cattle, said the owner's actions were 'stupid, cruel and irresponsible'

'There was nothing we could do. The 
dog eventually got off and then carried on chasing the cows until it 
finally fell down with exhaustion.

'A really brave man came over and managed to get a lead on it. I don’t think the owner even had a lead and he was really drunk.

'He dragged it up the road because it was exhausted. It was horrific.'

Another witness, who asked not to be named, said the dog was goaded into the attack.

He said: 'It was disgraceful. To get a dog to attack the cows is awful.'

And Barry Higgs, chairman of the Friends of Midsummer Common, said: 'There are people on the common who have given drink to dogs in the past.

'It’s deplorable but it is a very isolated incident. We are very keen on the cows here. '

The brutal attack happened at about 7pm on Wednesday evening in front of a crowd of passersby on Midsummer Common in Cambridge.

The cow was left with a large gash on its face, but it has been treated and its owner said it is 'well and calm'.

The injuries to the dog, which witnesses reported was called Spike - or Skype - was kicked by the cattle, have not been reported to Cambridgeshire Constabulary.

Dangerous dogs? Staffordshire Bull Terriers are generally known for their good temperaments, intelligence and fierce loyalty. But in the wrong hands, these traits can be manipulated, turning pets into deadly weapons

Officers want to trace the owners of the dog, believed to be a man and woman, and have released a description.

A spokesman said: 'The owners were described as a white man and woman.

'The woman was between about 5ft and 5ft 6in tall, in her 30s, with blonde hair and was wearing a pink top and had an orange jumper tied around her waist.

'The man was about 5ft 8in tall with dark hair.

'We are keen to trace the owners and anyone with information should call police on 101. The cow was treated by a vet.'

Cattle have been roaming free on picturesque Midsummer Common for hundreds of years.

Staffordshire Bull Terriers are generally known for their good temperaments, intelligence and fierce loyalty. But in the wrong hands, these traits can be manipulated, turning pets into deadly weapons.

The 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act bans four types of fighting dog including
the pit bull terrier, but the Staffordshire bull terrier is not one of 
them.
