Mexican archaeologists have uncovered the largest number of skulls ever found in 
one offering at the most sacred temple of the Aztec empire dating back 
more than 500 years.

The finding reveals new 
ways the pre-Colombian civilization used skulls in rituals at Mexico 
City's Templo Mayor, experts said. That's where the most important Aztec
ceremonies took place between 1325 until the Spanish conquest in 1521.

The
50 skulls were found at one sacrificial stone. Five were buried under 
the stone, and each had holes on both sides - signaling they were hung 
on a skull rack.

Experts believe that the skulls will reveal new ways that the Aztecs used skulls in rituals

Archaeologist Raul Barrera of
Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History said the other 
45 skulls appeared to have just been dumped on top of the stone.

The
team of archeologists unearthed the skulls and over 200 jaw bones in August. 
They stumbled on them as they were renovating a section of the Templo 
Mayor in the heart of Mexico City.

Barrera 
said they believe the skulls were those of women and men between 20 
and 35 years old and could have been dug up from other sites and 
reburied.

Last August, the Mexican government 
announced experts had found an unprecedented human burial at another 
spot in the same temple in which the skeleton of a young woman, possibly
sacrificed personifying a goddess, was surrounded by piles of nearly 
1,800 bones.

Another unusual finding this summer was a 'sacred tree,' 
which looks like a battered oak trunk emerging from a well and which 
experts say was brought from a mountain region for a ritual.

The
skulls are in good condition but cracked on 
each side of the head, possibly because of the wooden stake that ran 
through them so they could be placed in a skull rack.

Barrera said the key in the discovery was the sacrificial rock, which looks like a gray headstone.

'Underneath
the sacrificial stone, we found an offering of five skulls. These 
skulls were pierced with a stick,' he said. 'These are very important 
findings.'

University of Florida archaeologist
Susan Gillespie, who was not involved in the excavation, said it caught
her attention that the skulls that had been on the rack, called 
tzompantli, were buried separately.

'It 
provides rather novel information on the use and reuse of skulls for 
ritual events at the Templo Mayor,' said Gillespie.

Also,
the common belief about Aztec sacrificial stones is that a person being
sacrificed was killed by cutting open the chest and pulling out the 
heart.

'We normally associate (it) with heart 
removal rather than decapitation,' she said. 'It ultimately gives us a 
better understanding of how the Aztecs used the human body in various 
ways in their ritual practices.'
