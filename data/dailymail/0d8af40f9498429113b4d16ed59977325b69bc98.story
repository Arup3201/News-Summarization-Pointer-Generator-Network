No one couple escape the wrath of the baying mob in Vancouver as thousands
 of deranged fans took to the streets to vent their anger by smashing 
shops, overturning cars and attacking almost anything in sight following their team's Stanley Cup final defeat.

One man who tried to stop rioters from looting was kicked senseless amid the scenes of chaos on Wednesday night.

After one youth hit a window with a thin metal pole the man grabbed it, went after the youth and was suddenly submerged in the crowd.

He was pulled to the ground and kicked and punched before two men came to his aid as he lay there with his head bleeding.

The sickening incident happened before darkness as the city went into lockdown.

As the mayhem that followed the 
Canucks team's defeat to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup final, a 
large crowd gathered to smash in all the windows of a department store.

A man, dressed in a black top and baseball cap, grew increasingly frustrated trying to stop the mob.

Two hours later disturbing images 
show the increasingly aggressive crowd wrecking a young woman's BMW 
parked in the centre of the city as she desperately tried to stop them.

The two young girls stood up to baying crowds and pleaded with them not to attack their car.

Along with her diminutive female friend, the woman - wearing a white Vancouver T-shirt - was powerless as the mob stomped all over her car, smashing windows and kicking in the doors.

Police closed bridges into the city as tear gas was fired to quell mobs burning cars and looting.

Today thousands of residents paid tribute to the brave good Samaritans who stood up to the crazed mob.

But amid the chaos were a handful of brave individuals who dared to resist the onslaught and demand that the mob relent.

However, hundreds of people who were on the scene took photos and videos of the carnage, and uploaded them to social media sites aimed at gathering evidence for investigators.

Legal experts now believe that the number of people who are charged for taking part in the violence could grow.

Among the videos uploaded online is that of a man who is said to have stood up to an alleged troublemaker who tried to set fire to a car.

The man, dressed in black shorts, stands in front of an upturned car with his arms open and pleads for the mob to stop.

Another group of people try to push over a large van but the same man desperately hold it up until the crowd has dispersed.

He
 later confronts one of the alleged troublemakers and chases him across 
the street, urging him to go away. A scuffle then breaks out among the 
crowd.

This morning, as 
thousands of shocked residents woke up to the aftermath of the carnage, 
they took to the streets to voice their hurt at the previous nights 
activities.

Apologetic graffiti was daubed around 
the city. On a shop window that had been boarded up with wood, one 
resident scribbled: 'Fan's didn't do this'.

Somebody
 else sprayed: 'On behalf of my team and city, I'm sorry'. Elsewhere, a 
felt-tip doodle of a cartoon said: 'Flip pancakes, not cars'.

Just hours after the relentless tribal-like violence, the city began the clean-up operation to remove debris from the streets.

Experts
 predict the cost of damage could be millions of dollars but the the 
city's tarnished reputation could cost billions to repair.

More
 than 100 people were arrested but most of those were detained for 
breaching the peace or public intoxication, and were released within 24 
hours.

Just eight remained in custody on more serious charges such as break and enter, theft, mischief and assault with a weapon.

'In the next several weeks I would think we'll see that list of 100 people multiplied to several hundred,' legal analyst Steven Skurka told CTV's Canada AM on Friday.

Niamh Scallan, who witnessed the destruction, said that thousands of people were helping with the clean-up.

She said that the initiative seemed to take root among residents who were angry at the way their city was being portrayed.

She added: 'It kind of restored my faith in the city to be honest. ...It does make me feel like our community is back on the mend.'

Volunteers swept broken glass and collected garbage while helping to remove burned-out cars and replace smashed windows.

Describing Wednesday's violence, Vancouver Canucks captain Henrik Sedin said: 'It's terrible. This city and province has a lot to be proud of, the team we have and the guys we have in here. It's too bad.'

Amanda Harwood, a British woman living in the city, said: 'It's awful. There are vehicles on fire, overturned buses, smashed shop windows, fires in the shops, looting, stabbings, injuries from glass on the street, police are using tear gas.

'Bridges are closed and they have stopped anyone going to the downtown area.'

Vancouver police constable Jana McGuinness said: 'It's just a huge disappointment for everyone to see this.'

This morning a Facebook group was set up called 'Post Riot Clean up - Let's help Vancouver that said: 'Once the embarrassing rioting has ended in... Vancouver let's all show the world what Vancouver is really about by helping rebuild and clean up so it is better than it was before.

'If any city can bounce back from an embarrassment like this it is Vancouver!'

Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson said the city's true representatives are the citizens who volunteered their time to help clean up.

Robertson also said a full investigation would be launched to ensure that the incidents are never repeated.

Vancouver police constable Jana McGuinness said: 'It's just a huge disappointment for everyone to see this.'

Christy Clark, Premier of British Columbia, told The Globe and Mail: 'If you were a part of this, and I'm speaking to people who may have been responsible last night, I promise you this.

'You won't be able to live in anonymity, you won't be behind your bandana or under your hoodie.

'We are going to do everything we can to make sure the public understands who you were. Your family, your friends, your employer will know you were a part of it.

'Because this cannot happen in our city. It isn't the kind of city that I want to live in.'

Wai Young, the conservative MP for Vancouver South, made a reference to the riots in Parliament during a question period yesterday.

Using her Twitter page, she said: 'The violence is an embarrassment and absolute disgrace to our city.'
