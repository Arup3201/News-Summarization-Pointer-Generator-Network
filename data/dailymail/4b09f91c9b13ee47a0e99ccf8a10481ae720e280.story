Even if you read this in a fairytale book, you would still think it was far-fetched but Harry Kane does not want this story to end. A hat-trick just three days after your first ever England call-up? You simply could not write it. But Kane is composing his own scripts at the moment. His dream season continued on Saturday as he fired Tottenham to a hard-fought victory.

All this in front of England manager Roy Hodgson.

Kane will surely make his England debut in either Friday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania or the friendly against Italy a few days later after taking his season tally of goals to 29.

‘It’s true he’s in a very good moment in career. He’s at the top,’ said Mauricio Pochettino.

Tottenham’s victory came at a cost, though, with Hugo Lloris taken to hospital on Saturday after suffering a nasty gash to his knee in a collision with team-mate Kyle Walker and Jamie Vardy in the first minute.

You could sense the worry in White Hart Lane as the Frenchman received lengthy treatment before being replaced by Michel Vorm.

The mood picked up, though, as Spurs took a fifth-minute lead. No prizes for guessing who scored.

Eric Dier’s flick from Christian Eriksen’s corner was parried by Leicester goal keeper Kasper Schmeichel and the rebound fell to Kane who tapped home.

It was one of the simplest goals he’ll score — not that Kane cared an iota as he wheeled off in celebration.

David Nugent’s audacious attempt to catch Vorm off his line in the 10th minute nearly pulled the visitors level before Kane notched again in the 12th minute after a huge piece of fortune.

Walker and Andros Townsend combined brilliantly down the right to fire a low cross into the area.

Robert Huth’s attempted clearance fell to Kane, whose first-time strike took a big deflection off the German before bouncing past the luckless Schmeichel.

Leicester did not deserve to be on the receiving end of this clinical Kane show after a promising start.

It was nearly game over in the 22nd minute as Eriksen struck Schmeichel’s far post before Nacer Chadli wasted the rebound.

Pochettino was looking to his bench again six minutes later after Dier was caught by Vardy’s arm. The England Under 21 defender carried on, albeit with a painful lump on his right cheek.

But while Dier was showing great heart, the same couldn’t be said of his team-mate Chadli, who was booked for diving after falling in the box under pressure from Wes Morgan in the 36th minute.

Two minutes later Leicester worked themselves a deserved lifeline as Nugent sprung through Tottenham’s left-side before providing an inch perfect cross for Vardy, who cooly fired home with an excellent one-touch finish.

The visitors could easily have pulled themselves level before the break, Nugent and Leonard Ulloa wasting good chances.

Pochettino was desperate to get his team into the dressing room, but his half-time talk made no difference as Leicester levelled five minutes after the restart — Morgan ghosting into the area undetected to head home Matty James’ corner. Ten minutes later Leicester should have been ahead when Huth was presented with a golden chance to redeem himself following his role in Spurs’ second goal.

Somehow he didn’t take it, sending a free header from another James corner wide.

At the time it seemed a pivotal moment, and so it proved as Spurs were handed a contentious penalty in the 62nd minute.

Nugent thought he had time in the box, but Danny Rose had other ideas, nipping in front of the forward. He clumsily collided with the Spurs defender, who fell to the ground. In fairness to Nugent, the defender looked to go down easily but Mike Dean pointed to the spot.

Leicester coach Kevin Phillips was soon shaking his head at fourth official Darren Bond after racing down the tunnel to watch a replay.

The commotion didn’t concern Kane, though, as England’s newest recruit sent Schmeichel the wrong way to complete his hat-trick.

Spurs had their fourth in the 85th minute, the unlucky Jeff Schlupp diverting the ball into his own net after Schmeichel foiled Eriksen.

That should had seen Spurs home without fuss but Nugent set up a nervy three minutes after some poor Jan Vertonghen defending, to score Leicester’s third.
