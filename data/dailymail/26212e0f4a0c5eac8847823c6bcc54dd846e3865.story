Brussels Airport has announced that it will begin screening passengers arriving from Ebola-stricken countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Incoming passengers arriving from these three countries will have their temperatures taken starting today, the airport operator revealed.

Those showing a fever will be questioned by a nurse or doctor at the airport, and immediately sent to hospital if they are suspected of having the deadly virus.

Erika Vlieghe, who was appointed Belgium's national Ebola co-ordinator on Friday, said the measures add 'value' to the screenings already being done in West Africa before departure, EU Observer reported.

But Ms Vlieghe admitted that the chances that temperature screenings catch an Ebola case are small.

She noted that the measures were 'primarily to remove the increasing worries' of airport workers, adding that some will receive additional training on how to safely clean aircraft and how to react when someone has symptoms.

Four flights a week from the area concerned arrive weekly at Brussels Airport, including twice weekly flights from the Liberian capital of Monrovia.

Trade unions in Brussels had previously urged urged Brussels Airlines - the only European airline still flying to West Africa - to upgrade security procedures to better protect airline staff and passengers from the threat of Ebola.

Last week, Belgium was criticized for reportedly being the only European country still accepting flights from the epicentre of the Ebola crisis.

Passengers arriving on recent flights from Monrovia reported being screened before leaving Liberia but little or no extra health checks for Ebola when they landed in Brussels.

Airport officials in Brussels  defended the decision not to screen people arriving from West Africa, saying there there were emergency procedures in place in the event signs of Ebola show up on a flight.

But they say they have not yet needed to activate those procedures.

Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man who died from Ebola last week in a hospital in Texas, traveled through Brussels on his way from Africa to the United States. 

The total death toll of the Ebola outbreak, first detected in March deep in the forests of southern Guinea, has risen to more than 4,500, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Although Senegal and Nigeria have been declared Ebola-free, the epidemic remains out of control in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

WHO warns that by December there could be as many as 10,000 new infections per week. 

The deadly virus has also reached Spain and the United States but outbreaks have been contained so far. 

Major airports in the United States as well as London's Heathrow and other international gateways have started ramping up health checks for signs of the virus in passengers who may be arriving from Ebola hotspots.

Similar screening measures were begun Saturday at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, where one daily flight arrives from Conakry, Guinea.

There are no other direct flights to Paris from the other West African countries most affected by the virus.

On Friday, Brussels Airport also revealed  it had hired a specialized firm to check baggage coming from Ebola-hit regions, after a union told its members to no longer handle such items.

The company will screen luggage from Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia and destroy any it suspects may be contaminated.

Belgium's socialist union on Wednesday had called on its members at Brussels Airport to no longer handle baggage from infected areas.

The airport said in a statement it was 'taking such concerns seriously'.
