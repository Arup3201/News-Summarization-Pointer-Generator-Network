A surgeon and six accomplices have been jailed in China for illegal organ trading and intentional injury after a teenager sold them his kidney to buy an iPad and iPhone.

Song Zhongyu performed the back-street operation on the 17-year-old schoolboy, identified only as Wang, who agreed to part with the organ in exchange for gadgets worth around £1,900.

The student's mother raised the alarm after she became suspicious about where he had got the money for his new gizmos.

In the dock: The surgeon performed the back-street operation on the 17-year-old schoolboy, identified only as Wang, who agreed to part with the organ in exchange for gadgets worth around £1,900

Addressing the court: The group was said to have received around $35,000 (£22,000) for the transplant, while the student was reportedly given about $3,000 for his kidney, roughly £1,900

He finally admitted to the deal when he began suffering from renal failure, telling how he had met the gang in an online chat room.

A judge in Chenzhou City, in central China's Hunan Province, sentenced Song to three years behind bars with a reprieve of five years while the six others were jailed for between one and four years.

A healthy kidney can sell on the international black market for anywhere between £15,000 and £30,000.

China banned the trading of human organs in 2007 and have introduced a voluntary donor scheme to combat the trade.

But official figures from the health ministry show that about 1.5 million people still need transplants, but only 10,000 are performed annually.

As a result, the organ industry in China is booming and trading organs is a widespread online practice in the country.

Few Chinese agree to donate their organs after death, further fuelling the rampant llegal market activity.

Their sentence comes after mastermind He Wei was caged for five years for organising the illegal kidney trade in April 2011.

The group was said to have received 
around $35,000 (£22,000) for the transplant, while the student was 
reportedly given about $3,000 for his kidney, roughly £1,900.

He Wei earned $9,000 (£5,600) and Song was given £8,300 (£5,200) in the trade. The other seven defendants all received a share in the deal.

The case has prompted an outpouring of
concern that not enough is being done to guard against the negative 
impact of increasing consumerism in Chinese society, particularly among 
young people.

Apple products are extremely popular in China, but are too expensive for  many. IPhones start at around 3,988 yuan (£400), and iPads begin at 2,988 yuan - just under £190.

The country faces a constant shortage of organ donors.
