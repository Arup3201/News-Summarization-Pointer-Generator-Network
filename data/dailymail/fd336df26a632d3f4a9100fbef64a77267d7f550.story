Prosecutors have released jailhouse phone calls from George Zimmerman to his wife Shellie that show she knew the couple had access to $135,000 from a legal defense fund -- despite her testimony at a bail hearing that the couple were broke.

The audio tapes, which are made 
whenever an inmate at the Seminole County Jail places a call, also show 
that Zimmerman told his wife to buy bulletproof vests for him, for her and for 
their lawyer, Mark O'Mara.

'As uncomfortable as it is, I want you wearing one,' Zimmerman says.

Mrs Zimmerman also talks about a 'safety counselor,' who is apparently helping the couple on security measures. Zimmerman says he has received thousands of death threats since the shooting.

Accused of lying: George Zimmerman was re-arrested in June and his wife Shellie was charged after prosecutors accused them of not telling the truth about $135,000 they had collected from a legal defense fund

He also joked about having a hoodie to help him hide his face and slip out of jail about he posted bail.

Travyon Martin, famously, was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when Zimmerman shot him in the chest in February.

Zimmerman
is currently behind bars after he was re-arrested on June 3 when a 
judge revoked his bail. He posted $150,000 in April after he was charged
with second-degree murder in the February killing of 17-year-old 
Trayvon.

Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to the charges and says he acted in self-defense because he was being beaten by the teen.

His wife, Shellie, was arrested June 
12 on perjury charges. Prosecutors say she lied in court when she told a
judge that the couple had little cash to post for her husband's bail.

Back in jail: Zimmerman is awaiting a second bond hearing after he turned himself in on June 3. He is hoping to be released again while he awaits trial

Phone call recordings and bank records prove she knew the couple had collected $135,000 in donations through a website they established to fund Zimmerman's legal defense, authorities say.Â 

Zimmerman learned that the donation website he set up had crashed because it had so many visitors.

'Wow, that is awesome. Those people need to start vocalizing themselves,' Zimmerman tells his wife.

The six recordings made public on by State Attorney Angela Corey, the special prosecutor on the case, show Zimmerman and his wife appeared to be speaking in code in an attempt to conceal their discussion about finances.

He refers to the PayPal account that had collected $135,000 in donations as 'Peter Pan.'

The couple furtively talk about Zimmerman's 'account,' but don't refer directly to the PayPal donations.

Bank records that were also released on Monday show several electronic transfers that were made between the PayPal, Zimmerman's credit union account and Mrs Zimmerman's account.

Statement: Travyon Martin's death made hoodies famous because the teen was wearing one when Zimmerman shot him

She used several transactions, all less than $10,000, to move about $85,000 into her bank account so she could pay the bail, prosecutors say.

The couple also talk about their life after the trial.

'After all this is over, you're going to be able to have a great life,' Mrs Zimmerman says.

'We're will,' Zimmerman responds.

'Yeah, we will,' she says

'I'm excited,' Zimmerman replies.

He faces life in prison, if convicted of murdering Trayvon.

The comment about the hoodie came as the couple discussed how Zimmerman would escape from the gaggle of TV cameras after his release from jail.

'We could have two cars, we could have two rented cars,' Zimmerman said.

His wife suggests they switch the vehicles at a parking garage at the airport.

She also raises the possibility of using SUVs with tinted windows to hide her husband inside.

'Well, I have my hoodie,' he responds.

Zimmerman's lawyer said the couple misrepresented their finances because they were scared of the national attention they had received over the murder charges.

A second bond hearing is scheduled for June 29, where the judge will decide whether to give Zimmerman the chance to be released from jail again.
