From puppeteers and musicians to acrobats, folk singers and magicians, this is no ordinary community.

Clustered together in one Delhi slum, the 2,800 families are all street performers.

The origins of the multi-talented Kathpulti colony are unknown despite only dating back 40 years.

Creative: Budrul Lal, 44 (left), Sundr Bevi, 49, and Suacu Lal are all painters living in the Kathpulti community in a collection of Delhi slums where all their neighbours perform

Facing the street: Basanti Bhatt, 50, a head balancer (left), and Kesar Bhatt, an 80-year-old puppeteer (right), are protesting the government's move to oust to community

Variety: After 40 years, the 2,800 performers in the slum - including Sunita Davi, 30, and Burra Bhatt, 45, who make elephants, are being forced to leave

Monkey tamer: Chatta Khan, 45, spends his time rehearsing new tricks with his pet monkeys, which he takes to the street to perform with

But over time, it has inspired a cultural phenomenon.

However, as the government pushes a drive to spruce up the area, they are now being ordered to pack up and leave to make way for luxury flats.

The move has sparked fears of a creative drought in the region.

In a bid to capture the beauty of the community, British photographer Mark Leaver travelled to India to document the lives and talents of each resident.

One 50-year-old woman, Basanti Bhatt, stares stoically at the camera as she performs her act: balancing a five-foot vase on her head.

Practice: Children, like 15-year-old Laki Bhatt (left) and 12-year-old Honey Bhatt (right), spend hours every day rehearsing skills such as stilt walking and drumming

Hub: Jagdish Bhatt, 65 (left), and Rajkumar Bhatt, 50 (right) are two of a number of puppeteers in the slum which has created a wave of creativity in the Delhi region

Next door, Chatta Khan, 45, pauses for a moment to pose with his two monkeys as he rehearses taming them.

Nearby, an entire family, the Bhatts, have formed a joint act as musicians, and spend their days singing and dancing.

Budru Lal, Suacru Lal, and Sundr Bevi are all painters. Their tiny room is splattered with paint and decked with paintings of Hindu figures.

Unusual: Punna Gujat, 65 (left), is a chair maker and Basavraj Adewas, 65 (right), makes herbal medicine - both recognised forms of street performance

Residents like singer Babbie Bhatt, 45, (left) and Shabana Khan, who creates textile art (right), will be forced to make way for a new block of flats and a mall in the area

Dressed up: They spend the little money they have on outfits and instruments. Mohumed Shabbir, 34 (left), is a magician, and Rahool Bhatt, 19 (right), is a drummer

Other professions include toy elephant makers, herbal medicines doctors - a recognised street act - and drummers.

The Kathpulti Colony is said to have the largest single concentration of street artists in the world.

The graduate photographer knew he wanted to work on a substantial body of work abroad.

He began to research charities that he could volunteer with, as he knew as a volunteer he would be given immediate access and local contacts.

Makeshift: Hamid Brite, 18, is one of just a few so-called longmen in the colony, using stilts made from piece of wood and rope

Musicians: British photographer Mark Leaver went to stay with the community to capture their talents and met the Bhatt family of musicians

'I began looking globally for these opportunities, and then refined my choices down to charities that could accommodate me as a photographer.

'In the end it was a throw up between India and Kenya. I decided to go with India after looking at the slum the charity operated in.'

He explains that his project became very focused on the street performers who live in the slum.

'Initially I was just there to meet and get to know people while trying to adjust to the culture, I wanted to create formal portraits of slum residents alongside this.

'However after a few days in the slum there was no doubt in my mind that I had to make a formal set of portraits of the performers. I knew that the slum was famous for having street performers in it, but I don't think I was prepared for the world's largest concentration of street performers!'
