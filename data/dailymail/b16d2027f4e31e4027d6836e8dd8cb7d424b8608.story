Mechanical diggers are being used to excavate part of a busy airport in Burma as archaeologists step up their search for a lost squadron of World War II Spitfires.

The machines were spotted working by the side of a runway at Yangon (Rangoon) International Airport, with tents erected nearby.

The 21-strong team of archaeologists, led by Lincolnshire farmer David Cundall , is searching for rare Marx XIV Spitfires that were believed to have been buried in crates in August 1945.

Earlier this month the team found a wooden crate believed to contain one of the planes, but it was full of muddy water.

Britain
built a total of about 20,000 Spitfires, although the dawn of the jet 
age meant the propeller-driven planes quickly became obsolete.

As
many as 140 Spitfires - three to four times the number of airworthy 
models known to exist - are believed to have been buried in 
near-pristine condition in Myanmar by American engineers as the war drew
to a close.

The
single-seater Spitfire, which helped Britain beat back waves of German 
bombers during the war more than six decades ago, remains the most 
famous British combat aircraft.

Hope: The Spitfires are believed to have been buried as a way of disposal when the war came to an end

The wooden crate located in northern Burma was found in Myitkyina in Kachin state during a dig that began last month.

Mr Cundall said the search team in Kachin state inserted a camera into the crate and found it was full of water.

It was unclear what was inside the crate, he said, but the water will be pumped out during an operation that could take weeks, he said.

The go-ahead for excavation came in October when Myanmar's government signed an agreement with Mr Cundall and his local partner.

Under the deal, Myanmar's government will get one plane for display at a museum, as well as half of the remaining total.

DJC, a private company headed by Mr 
Cundall, will get 30 percent of the total and the Myanmar partner 
company Shwe Taung Paw, headed by Htoo Htoo Zaw, will get 20 percent.

During the project's first phase, 
searchers hope to recover 60 planes: 36 planes in Mingaladon, near 
Yangon's international airport; six in Meikthila in central Myanmar; and
18 in Myitkyina. Others are to be recovered in a second phase.

Critics have said it's 
possible all they might find is a mass of corroded metal and rusty 
aircraft parts.

But the search team say the Spitfires are believed to be in good condition because they were waxed, wrapped in greased paper and had their joints tarred by RAF crews.

Mr Cundall, 62, from Scunthorpe, started his treasure hunt in 1996 after hearing a throwaway remark from a group of US veterans who said they once buried Spitfires in Burma.

He tracked down an eyewitness who led him to the area where the aircraft were buried. He eventually located the buried planes using ground-penetrating radar equipment.

His team dug a borehole and sent down a camera to look at the crates, which were said to be in ‘really good condition’.

Mr Cundall said the practice of burying aircraft, tanks and jeeps was common after the war.

'Basically
nobody had got any orders to take these airplanes back to (the) UK. 
They were just surplus ... (and) one way of disposing them was to bury 
them,' Mr Cundall said.

'The war was over, everybody wanted to go home, 
nobody wanted anything, so you just buried it and went home. That was 
it.'

Stanley Coombe, a 
91-year-old war veteran from Britain who says he witnessed the 
aircraft's burial, traveled to Myanmar to observe the search.
