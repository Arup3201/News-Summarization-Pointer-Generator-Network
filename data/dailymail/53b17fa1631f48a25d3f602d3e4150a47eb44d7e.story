The co-founders behind the controversial gossip app Yik Yak are being sued by a former college friend who claims he was unfairly dumped from the highly lucrative business venture just as it was taking off.

Douglas Warstler filed his lawsuit against Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington in Georgia State Court in Fulton County on Monday.

All three previously attended Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, and were fraternity brothers at Kappa Alpha - where Buffington was Warstler’s ‘big brother’.

Warstler and Droll were both computer science majors and became close after building an app together in class.

The app didn’t take off but it prompted the three friends to form Locus Engineering, a development company that was divided evenly between the three of them.

A second app called Dicho also flopped, but included the ability to post anonymously – a key feature of Yik Yak, which allows people to create and view posts in secret within a 1.5 mile radius.

In his lawsuit, Warstler claims that he developed this key feature.

By October 2013, Droll and Buffington had graduated and were living in Atlanta, while Warstler was still at school.

The suit says he played a crucial role in marketing the app - now called Yik Yak - among other students at Furman, where it quickly proved very popular.

Just before Christmas, Buffington texted Warstler and offered to buy him out of the company. 

Days later, on December 28, Buffington emailed Warstler to tell him he was ‘not getting screwed out of anything,’ but that he needed to give up his part of the company.

'We need a fresh start with your name off of this [Yik Yak],' the email said, according to the suit. 

'I spoke with my parents over the holidays. They are making me get this settled before continuing to fund it.'

Warstler refused and by January 6, Buffington and Droll had dissolved the company without warning him. 

'We have decided that our best course of action is to dissolve Locus Engineering and set up a new LLC for Yik Yak,' said Buffington via another email, according to the suit. 

'Between Brooks and I, we jointly own all of the intellectual property of Yik Yak and Locus Engineering has no stake in it.'

Since January, the app has proved hugely successful with users and investors alike. 

It is one of the most downloaded apps this year and used on more than 1300 college campuses.

By June it had secured $10 million in venture capital funding, although recent reports suggest it may have raised around $75 million in new financing.

Warstler's lawsuit asks for one-third of Yik Yak to be returned to him along with punitive damages, compensatory damages and attorney’s fees.

'He started this company together with them and with the understanding that they’d be developing and marketing different iPhone applications,' Warstler's lawyer Luan Tran told Forbes. 

'Yik Yak was the second application that they started to work on together. The first one was not a success. He was responsible for Yik Yak going viral at Furman which was the Ground Zero or the testing area for this application.'

Tran recently represented ousted Snapchat cofounder Reggie Brown in his lawsuit against the former fraternity brothers who ousted him from the messaging app, which is valued at $10 billion.

Warstler's claims will be all too familiar to the Winklevoss brothers, who were dubbed the 'Wiklevii' in Facebook movie The Social Network

 In September, Chief Executive Evan Spiegel and Chief Technology Officer Robert Murphy acknowledged that Brown had been integral to the birth of app.

The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but Brown had been seeking a third and Tran had told Forbes that  he and his client were seeking 'over a billion dollars' in damages.

The claims of start-up skulduggery will also be all too familiar to the Winklevoss brothers, who were dubbed the ‘Wiklevii’ in the Facebook movie The Social Network.

It was in 2003 that they claimed they asked Mark Zuckerberg to write the code on their own social network, called Harvard Connection.

They alleged that he then started his own rival called thefacebook.com which went on to become the biggest website of its kind in the world with more than one billion users.

Whilst they were given their $65 million settlement Zuckerberg has gone on to become one of the richest men in the world. 

Warstler is currently a master’s student at Vanderbilt University.
