Police in Germany have raided dozens of addresses to foil an Islamist terror plot intending to use remote controlled model aircraft filled with explosives to be flown into targets.

Armed officers of the specialist G9G units raided homes in Stuttgart, Munich and Dachau after receiving information that at least one assassination attempt was being planned using the model planes as guided missiles.

Technical materials and paperwork were seized at several addresses while prosecutors spoke of plans for a 'seditious outrage'.Â

German intelligence officers have been warning for some time of a home-grown attack inside the country's borders as more and more Islamists return from Jihadist training camps in Pakistan ready to commit terrorist acts.

As well as the addresses in southern Germany, an Internet service provider in the state of Saxony was also raided. At least two men are in custody and authorities say the operations will continue as more intelligence is gathered.

No information was given about likely targets or exactly which Jihadist organisation the suspects are affiliated with.

French authorities have detained nine people suspected of plotting attacks in France or of belonging to jihadi networks in anti-terrorist raids this week, officials said.

France has been on higher alert for potential attacks since French troops entered Mali earlier this year to push out al-Qaida-linked extremists who had seized much of the West African country.

Police detained six people suspected of plotting terrorist attacks in the Paris region on Monday. The suspects, aged between 22 and 38 years old, were being questioned today by anti-terrorist investigators.

In an unrelated investigation, three suspected extremists were detained this morning by agents from the DCRI intelligence agency.

Some 48 people have been detained this year in 21 anti-terrorist operations. Most were let go, but some 17 remain in custody pending further investigation.

One of the addresses raided was at the 
Olympic Village in Munich, scene of the 1972 Olympic massacre when 
fanatics of the Black September movement stormed the living quarters of 
Israeli athletes.

All eleven hostages later died in a shootout at Munich
 Airport.

Prosecutors said that the arrests were linked to a plot centred on Islamist 'Holy war' but gave no further details.

German media reported that some model aircraft, which are powerful and big enough to carry explosives capable of destroying a commerical building, were seized in the raids early this morning.

The paperwork taken from several of the suspect addresses also relates to money laundering necessary to fund the planned outrages, according to media reports.

The suspects are of Tunisian descent.

Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which deals with internal terror threats, said only recently in its annual report that the country remains a 'top target' for Islamist fanatics for its support for NATO operations in Afghanistan.
