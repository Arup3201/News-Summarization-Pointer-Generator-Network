A man has been fined £818 after he downed a birthday pint containing lager, tomato ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and two fish. 

Terry Gallop, from Dilton Marsh in Wiltshire, was celebrating his 29th birthday when friends dared him to drink the suspect cocktail as part of a Neknomination challenge. 

He filled the pint glass with the mixture, topped off with vinegar, mint sauce, soy sauce, Jack Daniels and Coca-Cola, before glugging down the pint.

He was dared to down the pint, which included two guppy fish, by his friends to celebrate his 29th birthday

Gallop, a father-of-three, downed the cocktail - 
including two guppy fish - in one gulp. Prior to the challenge, he had drunk four cans of lager. 

His friend, Jason Williams, 28, from Westbury, filmed the challenge on his camera. 

Gallop, wearing a black Adidas Originals hoodie, can be seen stirring the murky black mix with a spoon in the video. 

He then adds two guppy fish - also known as 'rainbow fish' - to the pint. 

A
 group of friends can be heard chuckling as Gallop grins, while he 
swills the drink. He then lifts the glass up while looking at the 
camera, before downing the drink in 13 seconds.

The 29-year-old then wipes his mouth with his sleeve to a chorus of laughs in a kitchen on February 3 this year.

Gallop took 13 seconds to down the murky black pint for a Neknomination video that was filmed and put online

'Neknomination'
 is a drinking game in which people post videos of themselves on 
Facebook and other social media sites drinking dangerous and bizarre 
concoctions of alcohol and then dare their friends to outdo them. The 
game has claimed three British lives and sent many others to hospital.

Gallop
 admitted one charge under section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act at 
Salisbury Magistrates' Court, brought against him by the Royal Society 
for the Protection of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) after the video was 
spotted by a pet shop worker.

But speaking out after his court case, he
 said his actions were nothing compared to what celebrities did on the 
television show 'I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!'

The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global.

The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013.

The concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink Responsible'.

The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet. 

One extreme example featured a woman riding a horse into a supermarket and downing a can of Pepsi.

The game has claimed three British lives and sent many others to hospital.   

The married father-of-three said: 'People eat animals on "I'm a Celebrity" all of the time.

'What I did is not as bad as what they do on I'm a Celebrity.' 

He added: 'I didn't even know it was illegal and it was only two tiny, little fish.

'It was something that happened after a few drinks and it was just one of those things, but I do regret doing it now. 

'I couldn't taste the fish and the whole drink tasted horrible - it had mint sauce in it and tasted like a lumpy milkshake.' 

He continued: 'I was sick five minutes later in Jason's BMW. 

'He wasn't pleased but we've been best friends since we were seven years old.' 

His friend Williams admitted one offence under section 44 of the Magistrates' Court Act 1980 'of aiding and abetting' his friend. He was given a £988 fine for his part in the challenge. 

Williams, a gas repair company owner, said: 'I do regret what happened and I regret having to go to court as I got a £900 fine.

'What we did was wrong, but it was just a drunken thing.

'Where we live - in the country - if you see a spider in the house and you kill it, it is not considered a bad thing.' 

The pair were also banned from keeping fish for two years at Salisbury Magistrates' Court yesterday.   

RSPCA inspector Miranda Albinson said: 'These gentlemen may have been in high spirits as part of the birthday celebrations, but it is quite clearly not acceptable behaviour when it is detrimental to an animal's welfare.

'Hopefully this case sends out a clear message from the courts that such behaviour will not be tolerated.'
