Stephen Hayes arrives at Plymouth Crown Court, Devon. He groped a blind woman who thought he was someone else in a nightclub and has been told he faces jail

A man who kissed and groped a blind woman who thought he was someone else in a nightclub has been told he faces jail.

Stephen Hayes, 27, was on a night out at the Union Rooms pub in Plymouth when he began slow dancing with the woman, who has a visual impairment.

Plymouth Crown Court heard she thought he was another man that she had met earlier that night and they began to kiss and cuddle.

Hayes then went to touch her under her clothes and she realised her mistake and pushed him away with her knee. 

The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, later made a complaint to police and Hayes was charged with sexual assault. 

He changed his plea to guilty after earlier denying the charge of sexual assault between August 1 and August 4, 2013.

Because of her condition the victim can only recognise people by their body shape and clothing rather than facial features, the court heard.

The court heard the woman said she had kissed Hayes on the dance floor but that she had done so by mistake.

Prosecutors claim she soon realised it was not the friend she had been with earlier, but in fact a stranger. 

Prosecuting Jo Martin, said that Hayes approached the woman in the Union Rooms pub in Plymouth in Devon at about 1am.

She was on a night out with friends but says she was not drunk as she had only had a couple of glasses of wine.

The court heard she thought Hayes was a friend she had seen earlier that evening and they danced closely and started kissing.

Miss Martin said that he moved to indecently touch her under her clothes and she then realised the man was not her friend.

She said: 'She did not want to carry on'.

Miss Martin said that he touched her sexually and she moved her knee to push him away.

She added that a doorman who had seen some of what happened intervened.

The woman did not make a complaint to door staff immediately but did tell a female friend what had happened.

Miss Martin said: 'She decided that it was a horrible experience and that she would put it down to experience.'

But she added that police were called when there was 'argy bargy' between Hayes and the woman's friends.

Miss Martin said an officer visited the woman at her home a few days later and that was when she decided to make an official complaint.

She added that Hayes later said that he did not know the woman was disabled and that he believed what happened between them was consensual.

This morning he pleaded guilty to indecently touching the woman without her consent.

Judge Paul Darlow then formally directed the jury to reach a guilty verdict and warned Hayes he could be facing jail when he returns for sentencing on February 27.
