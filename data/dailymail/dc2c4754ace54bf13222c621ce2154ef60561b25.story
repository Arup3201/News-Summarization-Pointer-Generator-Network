Vincent Tabak’s lawyer admitted yesterday that his client’s behaviour after killing Joanna Yeates was ‘frankly disgusting’.

William Clegg QC told a jury three times that he would not attempt to justify Tabak’s actions in the weeks before his arrest when he attended dinner parties and went to work as if nothing had happened.

Giving the first detailed account of Miss Yeates’s death, Mr Clegg said Tabak had killed the landscape architect when she screamed as he tried to kiss her after being ‘beckoned’ into her home.

The 33-year-old engineer put one hand around her throat and the other over her mouth and in ‘seconds’ Miss Yeates was dead, it was claimed.

Mr Clegg said: ‘What he did after that won’t be excused by us. His conduct afterwards was frankly disgusting.

‘He took the body and hid it, thereby
causing untold anguish and agony to Joanna’s family who had no idea 
what had happened to her, and did everything to cover his tracks.’

Mr Clegg added that Tabak was a 
‘calculating person’ who had told ‘lie after lie’ in the weeks after his
crime but told the jury that what the defendant did after he killed his
neighbour was not what he was on trial for.

‘What he is being tried for is 
whether, when he killed Joanna Yeates, that was planned and premeditated
and something that he intended to do, or whether he panicked and did it
without thinking of the consequences.’

Mr Clegg said the Dutchman’s act had 
not been planned, and came after the victim had invited her next-door 
neighbour into her flat in Canynge Road, Clifton, Bristol.

Seeing him through her kitchen window,
the 25-year-old beckoned for Tabak to come in and then offered him a 
drink, Bristol Crown Court was told.

Mr Clegg said that although they had 
never really met, both had been alone, ‘bored’ and at a loose end on the
Friday night a week before Christmas last year.

But while Miss Yeates, whose boyfriend
was away from the flat they shared, was simply being ‘sociable’, the 
court heard that after a brief chat, 6ft 4in Tabak ‘completely misread 
the situation he had walked in on’.

Tabak, who admits manslaughter but denies murder, broke down and wept as his crime was described to the court.

Mr Clegg told the jury: ‘He misread 
her friendliness towards him and made a move towards her as if he was 
about to kiss her on the lips. He put one  arm behind her back to draw 
her closer to him.’

At this, the court was told, Miss 
Yeates let out a ‘loud piercing scream’. Tabak is then said to have 
panicked, put his hand over her mouth and told her to stop making a 
noise.

When he removed his hand, she continued to scream, the court heard, and he panicked again.

Mr Clegg said: ‘He put one hand around her throat and the other over her mouth. In seconds, Joanna went limp. She was dead.’

As Mr Clegg addressed the jury Miss 
Yeates’s parents David and Teresa, her brother Christopher and her 
boyfriend Greg Reardon listened intently from the front row of the 
public gallery.

Mr Clegg insisted that his client had
never intended to kill Miss Yeates and said it was ‘pure chance’ that 
the pair had even met on December 17.

If Miss Yeates had stayed on in the 
pub with her colleagues for one extra drink and not arrived home when 
she did, it was said, ‘she would still be alive today’.

Mr Clegg added: ‘If Vincent Tabak had 
left 30 minutes earlier to go to Asda, as was his intention, he would 
not be standing in the dock now.’

The jury was told that after realising
‘to his horror’ that he had killed Miss Yeates, Tabak carried her body 
to his flat where he wrapped her in a bicycle cover before bundling her 
into the boot of his Renault Megane and dumping her body by the side of a
country road.

He also placed in a dustbin the pizza 
Miss Yeates had bought on her way home along with a grey ski sock  that 
had fallen off her foot and the bike cover.

The trial continues.
