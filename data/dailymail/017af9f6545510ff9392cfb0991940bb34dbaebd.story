A secret plot to boot John Bercow out of the Commons is being drawn up by senior Tory MPs.

They are planning to eject the Speaker from his Buckingham constituency at the next General Election by fielding a ‘proper’ Tory candidate against him.

The move would drive a coach and horses through the convention at Westminster that sitting Commons Speakers are never challenged at General Elections by candidates from the three main political parties.

But some senior Tories are now so angry over Mr Bercow’s attempt to appoint an ‘unqualified’ Australian to be the new Commons Clerk that they are determined to remove him.

'Beyond a joke': Senior Tories have criticised John Bervow's performance after he attempt to recruit the 'unqualified' Carol Mills (right) as the £200,000-a-year Commons Clerk 

One said privately last night: ‘Putting up a Tory candidate against Bercow at the Election may break with convention but frankly, the Speaker’s performance is beyond a joke.

‘This may be the nuclear option but we have to act.’

At the last Election in 2010, former Tory MP Mr Bercow was famously challenged by Ukip leader Nigel Farage in Buckingham, beating him by 14,450 votes. But the Tories, Labour and Liberal Democrats honoured the Commons convention that as Speakers give up their party political affiliations when they take office, they should not face candidates from the main parties at Election time.

The secret plans emerged as Mr Bercow faces a Commons’ showdown this week over the controversial decision to propose Australian parliament official Carol Mills to the £200,000-a-year Commons Clerk and Chief Executive post.

In a full-scale Commons debate, MPs are set to ask how an interview panel led by Mr Bercow chose Ms Mills to be the Commons’ main constitutional adviser and expert despite claims she had no real experience for that key role.

Mr Bercow was last week forced to ‘pause’ the appointment process in the face of protests from MPs who also want to know how Ms Mills was picked when her department in Canberra is undergoing two separate investigations – including one into claims that officials used CCTV to spy on an Australian senator’s office.

However, there were fears last night that MPs were under pressure not to ‘rake over’ the details of the panel’s decision and instead focus on whether the Commons’ Clerk role should be split to create a procedural/constitutional adviser post and a separate chief executive to oversee everyday running of Commons’ facilities.

At the last Election in 2010, former Tory MP Mr Bercow was famously challenged by Ukip leader Nigel Farage in Buckingham, beating him by 14,450 votes.

The fears grew amid signs from the Speaker’s office that Mr Bercow intends to chair this week’s debate, despite private claims from some MPs that it would be ‘completely wrong’ for him to oversee a debate where his conduct could be a key part of the discussions.

Last night, Tory MP Michael Fabricant, one of the Speaker’s fiercest critics over the issue, said colleagues had to be able to demand ‘full’ answers over how the nomination had been arrived at. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The Speaker cannot be allowed to walk away from what has been a shambolic and woeful selection procedure, which has not only disrupted the House of Commons and its officers but has also hurt the reputation of the candidates for the job.’

Many MPs insist that David Natzler, deputy to outgoing Commons Clerk Sir Robert Rogers, should have got the job.

Last night, allies of the Speaker reacted in fury to the Tory plot to unseat him and insisted Conservative party chiefs would not sanction any such challenge.

Tory MP Charles Walker said: ‘Putting a Conservative candidate up against John Bercow would break with a hallowed Commons tradition. Speakers are non-partisan, non-political figures, and although some people may think this is a clever wheeze now, they would come to regret it in the long term.’
