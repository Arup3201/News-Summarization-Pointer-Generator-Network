A newborn girl has been killed by a dog that her father brought home from a pub, it was reported yesterday.

The body of six-day-old Eliza-Mae Martha Mullane was found by her mother Sharon John after the infant was apparently mauled by a male Alaskan Malamute, a powerful, husky-type dog bred for pulling sleds.

The distraught mother ran into the street and screamed: ‘The dog ate my baby’s head.’

The pet was said by neighbours to have been with the family for just a few months after the little girl’s father Patrick Mullane arrived home with the animal after a night out.

Attack: Ms John and Mr Mullane (pictured)'s newborn daughter died following a suspected dog attack by the family's Alaskan Malamute called Nisha

Friends said the 33-year-old had rescued the dog, called Nisha, after
 being told its previous owner was going to have it destroyed.

Yesterday
 neighbours in the village of Pontyberem, near Carmarthen, South Wales, 
spoke of the nightmare scenes after Eliza-Mae was found dead and police 
seized the animal from the family home.

The baby had already spent
 three days in intensive care in hospital after being born last 
Wednesday, and came home to her newly prepared nursery only at the 
weekend.

Police were called to the house that Miss John, 42, 
shares with Mr Mullane and her two other children Harley, five, and 
Lily-Rose, three, at about 8.30am yesterday.

Neighbour Patricia Punter, 71, said: ‘It was terrible.

‘I’ve never heard anything like it. Sharon was in a state of shock and just screaming.

‘She just kept on saying, “The dog ate my baby’s head. The baby’s gone”.

‘They’d had the dog for a few months because Pat is really soft for dogs.

Sharon John, 42, ran to her neighbours after her six-day-old girl was found dead next to their pet dog called Nisha

‘He
 brought it home from the pub because someone had told him they were 
going to get rid of it. Nisha was about five or six years old but looked
 older. I think it may have badly treated in the past.

‘God only 
knows what has gone on in there. But Sharon was in bits – she was with a
 policeman and they wouldn’t let her back into the house.

‘She’d only brought the baby home in the last week. It is just awful. They loved their dogs as much as their children.’

Officers have revealed the family dog has been seized in connection with the death

The family have another pet dog, a terrier called Roxy.

Family friend Gemma Prosser, 22, described the incident as ‘heart-breaking’.

‘One
 minute they had a bundle of joy in their arms and all those lovely 
things to look forward to when you are new parents,’ she said.

Incident: Eliza-Mae and her family lived in Pontyberem, Wales

The Alaskan Malamute is the largest of the Arctic dog breeds.

The breed is extremely loyal and intelligent, sweet and most affectionate toward its master.

They are described as being great with children who are old enough to play with him safely.

They are very friendly and therefore are not suitable as guard dogs. 

Alaskan Malamutes were originally bred as sled dogs for work in the Arctic, but are now popular as family pets.

The
 Alaskan Malamute Club of the United Kingdom describes the breed as a 
'affectionate, friendly, loyal, devoted companion' on its website.

It
 says an ideal Alaskan Malamute is 'heavily boned, powerfully built' - 
and are also very intelligent animals, though they can be hard to train.

Alaskan Malamute is similar to a husky 
which is not a banned breed. Males grow to about 85 lb (39kg) and 
females to 75 lb (34kg).

The dog, similar to a husky, is not a banned breed.

‘The next minute they have lost their little girl in such a terrible way. This is a horrible thing to happen.’

Miss
 Prosser, a student, said the couple had not experienced any problems 
before with their pet, but added that it had been running in and out of 
the house for the past couple of days.

Mr Mullane, a scrap metal dealer, and Miss John were taken away from their home to be interviewed by police.

Chief
 Inspector Ieuan Matthews said Eliza-Mae was taken to the University 
Hospital of Wales in Cardiff but had been dead by the time the ambulance
 arrived.

Chief Insp Matthews said: ‘We had a call from the 
ambulance service just before 8.30am. The little girl is six days old, 
tragically. As you can imagine, the family are hugely distressed.

‘These are tragic circumstances and our hearts go out to everyone involved.

‘We have taken the family dog into our possession and inquiries are continuing.’

Police
 said that a post-mortem examination would be held to investigate the 
cause of death before they would confirm it was a dog attack.

Neighbours
 said they often saw Nisha on a lead with the couple. They would tie it 
up outside a local supermarket where children would stroke it. Ann 
Williams, 69, said: ‘It wasn’t a savage dog. It would let children pet 
it and it was a very attractive animal.’

The death comes barely a 
week after 11-month-old Ava-Jayne Corless was killed by a pit-bull 
terrier as she slept at a house in Blackburn.
