A 15-year-old boy has died of leukaemia just hours after his classmates went on strike when their school banned them from wearing charity bracelets to support him.

Joel Smith, a Year 11 pupil at Bilton School in Rugby, Warwickshire, died last Thursday evening - one day after police were called in when 100 students walked out of lessons.

The schoolchildren had been told they could only wear 'Team Joel' beaded bracelets - made and sold by his family to raise funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust - on a non-uniform day next month.

Controversy: Police were called by teachers when 100 pupils walked out of lessons at Bilton School in Rugby, Warwickshire, after being told they could only wear 'Team Joel' bracelets (pictured) on a non-uniform day

Pupils who wanted to wear the 
wristbands in support of Joel at other times were told they would be violating the uniform policy. But last Wednesday, pupils mounted a protest on
 the school field.

A Bilton 
School spokesman said: ‘We will continue to work with our students and 
families to support the whole school community at this extraordinarily 
sad and difficult time.’

The school added that it would say nothing more ‘out of our deepest respect for Joel Smith’s family’.

Joel’s
 friends took to Twitter to express their sadness at his death. Charly 
McLeod said: ‘Rest in paradise Joel - heaven has granted another perfect
 angel. Gone but never forgotten. Team Joel.’

Showing their support: Pupils at Bilton School in Rugby showed whose side they were on last week

be forgotten, always in our hearts. My thoughts go out to his family and
 friends.’

Bilton School spokesman

Following the 
strike last Wednesday, mother Emma Howell told the Daily Mirror that she
 would be backing her daughter Laura's participation in it, despite her 
missing a mock examination.

She
 said: 'I support my daughter. The only resolution I can see is if the 
school back down because the pupils are very passionate about this, and I
 can’t see them letting it go.’

The
 school said it had responded several weeks ago to a request from the 
children to have a non-uniform day for Joel, and he had requested that 
pupils wear blue and white coloured clothing.

Support for staff and pupils: A Bilton School statement said it was an 'extraordinarily sad and difficult time'

Reasoning: The school said it had responded several weeks ago to a request from the children to have a non-uniform day for Joel, and he had requested that pupils wear blue and white coloured clothing

Firm stance: Bilton School refused to let its pupils wear a charity bracelet in support of the pupil every day

This
 was planned for April 11, but the school also told pupils that the 
bracelets could only be sold and worn on that day - a policy which caused much anger among the children last week.

A
 spokesman said: ‘We spoke to students and said that they could show 
their support by attaching the bracelets to bags or keys but not wear 
them as bracelets, in order to comply with our policies.

‘This
 has been the topic of quite extensive social media comment over the 
last two days, culminating in a call from students and parents for 
students to strike yesterday [last Wednesday].

‘Although
 this was a largely peaceful event, we called the police who supported 
us in evaluating the safety of staff and students, which is paramount to
 us.’

Punishment: The school said it explained to the students how it was helping Joel and his family, and those who quickly returned to lessons would make up the lost learning time during detentions

Doing their bit: The school said it had responded several weeks ago to a request from students to have a non-uniform day for Joel, and he had requested that students wear blue and white coloured clothing

The school added that 
it then told pupils how it was helping Joel and his family - and the 
many of them who quickly returned to lessons would make up the lost 
learning time during detentions.

But
 the spokesman continued: ‘There were a small minority of students whose
 actions can only be described as anti-social and potentially dangerous 
who used this as an opportunity to be disruptive.

‘These
 students were putting pressure on others not to go back into classrooms
 and contacted the press. We will be evaluating the actions we will be 
taking with these students over the next few days.’

The Facebook page 'Spotted: Rugby Town' had been inundated with angry comments when the ban on bracelets was announced, with some people branding the decision 'disgraceful'.
