Good health: Mary Berry, pictured, has said that children should be taught how to cook ten good value and healthy meals before they leave school

All children should be taught to cook ten full meals at school, television chef Mary Berry has said.

Teachers should 'blow the science of it' and go back to showing young people 'what's good for them, how to buy it and how to make a few dishes that they enjoy and don't cost too much', she said.

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the Great British Bake Off host told an audience she only took up cookery after being considered 'too dim' for academic subjects.

She was sent to domestic science by teachers where she blossomed, she said.

From there, a teacher praised her first efforts at making a treacle pudding and helped her develop her interest in cooking.

When asked about the status of cookery teaching today, which can include lessons on nutrition and designing food packaging, she said: 'Hopefully it's coming back in schools.

'There is a drive for it to come back in schools and so there should be.

'But not in the form that it has been lately.

'It should be that every child when they leave school can do 10 meals, because when they leave home they've got to be able to eat healthily.

'Blow the science of it and everything else. They've just got to be able to know what's good for them, how to buy it and how to make a few dishes that they enjoy and don't cost too much.'

Mary, 78, also paid her Great British Bake Off colleagues Mel and Sue a compliment about their skills in the kitchen during the festival.

According to the Radio Times, she said: 'Mel and Sue are competent bakers… just.

'They are a sheer delight to work with. It is laughter all the way.'

Mary's appearance comes as it was revealed the chef had cooked up a fortune of £15million.

The chef was catapulted to TV favourite over the past three years after appearing opposite Paul Hollywood in the hugely successful BBC2 show.

But she has long had a thriving career - publishing more than 60 best-selling recipe books.

She also has a hugely successful cooking sauce and condiment business - including dressings and chutneys.

Official figures for her condiments company, Mary Berry And Daughter Ltd, show the business made a profit of £1.076million in 2012, with cash assets of more than £1million.

Should children be taught how to cook ten different meals at school?

Mary also owns property worth at least £10million with her retired antique-book seller husband, Paul.

Her company HQ is based alongside her home in Buckinghamshire, where she owns more than two acres, including a lake.

In the past eight years it is estimated Mary has amassed £2.3million from her book sales.

Her media income since the launch of The Great British Bake Off is believed to be more than £200,000 a year.
