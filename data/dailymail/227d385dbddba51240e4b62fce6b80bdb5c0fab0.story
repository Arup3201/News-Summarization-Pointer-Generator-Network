I can’t wait to compete at the European Indoor Championships in Prague, which is the biggest competition of the season so far. For multi-eventers, packing your suitcase to go abroad can be a bit of an ordeal. 

I noticed it more last year when I just did long jump at the World Indoors and I only had to take one pair of trainers. With pentathlon I’ve got five different pairs of spikes for the hurdles, high jump, shot putt, long jump and 800m. 

All kinds of things come with being a multi-eventer and making sure you have room in your case is just one of them. It was easy for this weekend because I’m not away for long so will pretty much live in my GB kit and a couple of pairs of jeans.

Normally at Championships I room with Holly Bleasdale or Jodie Williams but neither of them are competing in the indoors this season so I don’t know who I’ll be in a room with this time – you get the chance to pick but I just left the box empty. Sprinters normally have their events in the afternoon so they can stay up later and sleep in whereas I’m always on first thing so it’s more about trying to find someone that matches your timetable than your personality.

I’m just competing for the one day on Friday so I’ll have the rest of the weekend just to relax and be a spectator so it will definitely be good to do that. As well as being supported by the National Lottery I am supported by the philanthropist Barrie Wells, who also sponsors Jenny Meadows so I’ll be with him in the crowd cheering her on and holding a banner for the 800m final on Sunday. If I’m rooting for any athlete other than myself it’s going to be Jenny because she’s had such a tough past. She’s been so unlucky not just with injuries but competing with lots of drugs cheats in her event.

I’m glad athletics is being cleaned up because to have an equal playing field means so much to us as athletes. You dedicate your life to it and it’s so upsetting to think someone might be getting an unfair advantage and there’s literally nothing you can do about it. It’s definitely good that all the drugs cheats are getting exposed and it’s going to be a clean sport.

I’ve got personal bests in the long jump and high jump already this season. The last time I did pentathlon was 2012 because I didn’t do an indoor season in 2013 and last year I was ill. I was a little kiddy in 2012 so I definitely should be getting one this time.

I feel like a different person since I had a foot injury, which ruled me out of the Commonwealth Games and European Championships last year. I can’t really pinpoint what has changed I just enjoy being out there and I’m not nervous to compete any more. Sometimes before the injury I used to think: “I just want to be a normal teenager or young person” but I realised it was this that I love and enjoy. It made me realise what I will be missing out on.

I’ve been focussing so much on the indoors that I haven’t had chance to do a lot of javelin training which is one of my weakest events. I’m really looking forward to my next session with the British number one Goldie Sayers, who is helping me work on my technique, in April.

Away from competition, there’s been a new addition to my household - I’ve got another sausage dog as a companion to Chorizo. I’ve called him Bronx. I wanted to call him Richmond to stick with the sausage themed names but my boyfriend said it was too posh and I was trying to push the sausage names too much! He’s well trained though, much better than Chorizo. I think it’s like having children - you make more mistakes with the first one and then correct them with the second!

As well as funding the Road to Rio athletes, every week National Lottery players raise over £33 million for arts, heritage, charity, community projects and grass roots sports clubs and facilities. Find out where your money goes at lotterygoodcauses.org.uk
