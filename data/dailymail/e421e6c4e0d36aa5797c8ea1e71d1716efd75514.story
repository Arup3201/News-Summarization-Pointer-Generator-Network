This is the terrifying moment a trawler crew pulled in its net to find a 1,000lb unexploded Second World War bomb.

The three-foot explosive - believed to have been jettisoned off the North East coast by an RAF bomber - was reeled in by the crew on board the Ticino vessel off the coast of South Shields.

The crew immediately alerted the coastguard, with members boarding the ship to help move the bomb to Whitley Bay.

A Navy bomb disposal squad and divers from Clyde Naval Base confirmed the 1,000lb explosive was British.

They ensured it was dropped into waters around a quarter of a mile from the coast before a controlled detonation took place. 

Adrian Don, a member of the Tynemouth RNLI, said the crew were shocked when they hauled the large explosive aboard their vessel.

He said: 'The lifeboat went out to escort the boat with the bomb. It had been caught up in the nets and hauled on board.

While unexploded Second World War bombs are not often found, this one follows a spate of weapons washed up on the south coast last year.

In April last year, a hand grenade was found on Charnmouth beach, Dorset, by a man who then tried to take it to a fossil museum, sparking panic. It was later detonated on the beach.

In March, a shell from a WWII Howitzer gun was discovered on the same stretch of beach  and in February, Perranporth beach in Cornwall was closed briefly after a WWII bomb was washed up in storms.

In January, a suspected Second World War explosive was safely detonated by a bomb disposal squad after washing up in bad weather on St Anne's beach in Lancashire.

'The weight of it, the crew must have thought they had a huge catch.

'The lifeboat crew went on board to help rig up some rope work to lower it over the side at Whitley Bay.'

He added that the sea bed is littered with thousands of these devices, which have been left over from both the First and Second World Wars, and it is not unusual for them to get caught up nets. 

The bomb was taken out to sea earlier today so it could be safely destroyed. 

A Royal Navy spokesman said: 'Our divers and bomb disposal squad were dispatched to the scene, and found it was an unexploded, 1,000lb British bomb.

'It was taken ashore and then dropped into the waters around a quarter of a mile from the coast before it was destroyed in a controlled explosion.'
