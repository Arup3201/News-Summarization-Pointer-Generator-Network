Jack Wilshere has been full of praise for Mario Balotelli ahead of England's World Cup opener against Italy on Saturday.

However, despite describing Balotelli as a great player, Wilshere is confident England's defensive players will be able to cope with the Italy frontman.

England know all about Balotelli after he spent two-and-a-half seasons playing in England with Man City and Wilshere insists Roy Hodgson's men are more than capable at keeping him quiet.

Full of praise: Jack Wilshere insists Mario Balotelli is a great player but is sure England can cope with him

'First and foremost, we have to worry about him as a player,' Wilshere told Sky Sports.

'He is a great player. We have seen that in the past. But we have got players who have played with him like Joe Hart, and we have defenders who have played against him in the Premier League.

'I don't think that will be a problem.'

Wilshere's comments come four years after Balotelli claimed he had never heard of the Arsenal youngster after beating him to the Golden Boy trophy, organised by Turin newspaper Tuttosport and voted for by European journalists to acknowledge the best players under the age of 21.

Beating Wilshere into second place, the former Inter Milan frontman said: 'What's his name? Wil ... ? No, I don't know him, but the next time I play against Arsenal I will keep a close eye on him. Perhaps I can show him the Golden Boy trophy and remind him that I won it.'
