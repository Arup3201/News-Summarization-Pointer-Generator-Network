David Beckham has long been known as a fashion icon, with billboard campaigns almost as common as England appearances during the later years of his career.

Now, England's most capped outfield player is posing again, this time alongside comedian James Corden, in a less orthodox shoot.

Beckham's chiselled physique is placed alongside Corden's rather fuller frame in a fake advert filmed for the comedian's new role as host of CBS' 'Late Late Show'.

Both men narrate over the video, with Beckham claiming 'beauty is skin deep - it's underneath that counts' while Corden dances around him.

And Beckham also gets a bit of the 'hairdryer treatment' - though not in quite the same way he used to face it from former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson. 

The shoot ends with Corden giving the tagline: 'D+J briefs. Underwear for a man with a great body... and David Beckham'.

Beckham is now stranger to modelling underwear, but this could be a first for Corden

The two men voice over the short clip, with Corden hugging and dancing around Beckham
