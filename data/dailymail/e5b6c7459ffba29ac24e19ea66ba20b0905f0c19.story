Football fans will have their voice heard in every boardroom in the country, if plans unveiled by Labour on Friday are approved. 

Labour hope this will stop the wishes of fans being ignored when decisions are made concerning their clubs, as has been seen in recent years at Cardiff City and Hull. 

The Welsh side's owner Vincent Tan changed the colour of Cardiff's home shirts from blue to red in 2012 despite strong opposition from supporters, while Hull City became Hull City Tigers in 2013, removing 'Association Football Club' which had been part of the name since its formation in 1904.

Meanwhile, in 2013, Hull City owner Assem Allam changed the club's name to include Tigers after Hull City 

Labour argue despite the commercial explosion of English and Welsh football, there are no effective means for fans to have a say in how their clubs are run or to protect their long-term interests. They say this lack of accountability has led to:

• Supporters’ interests and identity being ignored: from clubs being relocated away from fan-bases (Coventry) to team colours and names being changed to satisfy traditions on the other side of the globe (Cardiff, Hull)

• Debt and insolvency: which have seen  football clubs (Portsmouth, Leeds, Birmingham) forced into administration. 36 football league clubs (exactly half the total number of members) have gone into administration since 1992

• Unsustainably high ticket prices: despite record turnover, average ticket prices in England and Wales remain amongst the highest in Europe - only this week, the BBC’s Price of football survey showed how average prices have risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011

Clive Efford MP, Labour's Shadow Sports Minister, will launch the proposals, which have been drawn up in consultation with 95 football supporters' organisations, and would require supporters to come together to form a single accredited trust. 

In return they would have the right to appoint directors to the board of their clubs and the option to buy up to 10 per cent of shares if their club changes ownership.

'Too often fans are treated like an after-thought as ticket prices are hiked-up, grounds re-located and clubs burdened with debt or the threat of bankruptcy,' said Efford. 

'Only this week, the BBC Price of Football survey showed how average prices have risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011. We have reached a tipping point in the way football is run.

'The Labour Party has listened to the views of fans about changing the way football is run in England and Wales. And we want to ensure they are heard by the owners of the clubs too. 

'We will now consult further on proposals to enshrine on the statute books the idea that football have a special place in people's hearts – and should be the heart of our communities.'

Football fans up and down the country continue to be squeezed as ticket prices rise above the rate of inflation

Arsenal topped the list for the most expensive matchday ticket at £97 and dearest season ticket at £2,013

Jon Cruddas MP, head of Labour’s Policy Review, added: 'The Premier League is a huge success. But football is more than a business. Football clubs are part of people’s identity and sense of belonging. Our plan is to give fans a stake in their clubs.' 

'Labour believes in sharing power and responsibility with people, and giving football fans a voice is part of our plan to change our country by devolving power to our cities, towns and communities. We believe in a society that gives power to people.'
