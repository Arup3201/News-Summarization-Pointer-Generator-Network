A doctor who was exposed by the Mail on Sunday for helping motorists to make bogus whiplash claims is to appear before a disciplinary hearing tomorrow.

Dr Muhammad Raheel Shaikh charged £250 for an 18-minute-long ‘medical examination,’ where he diagnosed an undercover reporter as having whiplash injuries, even after the fake motorist said he suffered from no pain.

His medical report - which stated that the bogus patient was suffering from moderate whiplash injuries - could have been used by the reporter to make a false personal injury claim worth thousands of pounds.

The MoS investigated Dr Shaikh, 41, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, as part our campaign to end the scourge of bogus whiplash claims, which costs the insurance industry £2billion per annum, and had put the premium of every motorist by £90 per year.

Our campaign prompted the move to change legislation that has led to insurance premiums falling by almost 10 per cent over the past 12 months.

Latest figures from the AA show that an average fully-comprehensive policy is now £594.86, compared to £659. 53 last July.

The AA said that this was the biggest drop in insurance premiums since their index began in 1994.

In response to our campaign, the Government introduced tighter laws to clamp down bogus personal claims, which had made Britain the ‘whiplash capital of Europe.’

From 2005 to 2010, accident injury claims soared by 70 per cent, despite road accidents falling by 23 per cent.

New Government measures include banning controversial referral fees, or payments of up to £800, that law firms pay middlemen and claims companies for every personal injury claimant they introduce to them.

The Government is also considering a national panel of independent doctors, who will medically assess whiplash patients, rather ones appointed by insurance companies and claims firms.

Dr Shaikh, who was on the Yorkshire and Humber GP training programme at the time and was on placement at Doncaster Royal Infirmary at the time, was approached by the MoS reporter after we received a tip-off about him from another whiplash injury expert.

The doctor, who held his whiplash clinics at a sports centre in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was going to see 10 patients that day, which would have netted him £2,500 for a few hours work.

The medic initially told our reporter ‘honesty is the best policy,’ but said later: ‘I’ll help you….I know what to say.’

The General Medical Council, which is investigating Dr Shaikh, said: ‘The Panel will inquire into the allegation that during a consultation with Patient A [MoS reporter] on 2 June 2012 Dr Shaikh asked leading questions and provided suggested responses to Patient A.

‘It is also alleged that in a report, dated 2 June 2012, he made false statements. It is further alleged that his conduct was misleading and dishonest.’

The hearing is expected to last all week.

Dr Shaikh could not be reached for comment.
