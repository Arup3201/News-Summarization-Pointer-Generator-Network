This is the moment one of the biggest steel furnaces in the western world fell to the ground in just three seconds after being blown up.

The 320-foot tall Sparrows Point L-shaped furnace at the Bethlehem Steel Plant in Baltimore was imploded yesterday to make room for a new development.

Two demolition companies were used to carry out the blast as well as nearly 100 explosive charges.

The furnace starts to tumble to the ground after 100 explosive charges are detonated to make it implode 

People living nearby were only told about the implosion hours before it was due to take place as there were concerns it would draw large crowds.

They were told to expect loud noises and a rumbling and were warned there would be no access to the site.

When built it 1978, the furnace was the largest of its type in the world and remained one of the biggest on the east coast of America until it was demolished.

At its peak, up to 30,000 local people were employed at the steel mill.

But in 2001, it ran into financial difficulties and went through five different owners before operations ceased in 2012.

The decision was taken to develop the site of the mill last year and clean up contamination and industrial pollution.

Once it has been cleared, it will be used as a hub for manufacturing and distribution.

In a statement, Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz said: 'Today marks an ending and also an important beginning for bringing new 21st century jobs and new development back to the point.

'We are excited that Sparrows Point Terminal shares the county's vision of a vibrant Sparrows Point peninsula, offering tremendous business opportunities for companies looking for a prime location near the Port of Baltimore with interstate, rail and deep water access.'
