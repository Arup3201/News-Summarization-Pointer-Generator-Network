England's players were expected to be caught out by the heat in Manaus but instead their main trouble came from a more typical sportsman's woe - cramp.

Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Gary Cahill were all troubled during England’s 2-1 defeat to Italy in Manaus.

The 27C heat and the 74 per cent humidity in Brazil could well have played a factor in their discomfort, as all three needed the help of their teammates, physios - and at one point even their opponents – to stretch out their weary legs.

Pushing it: Cahill has been through a Champions League campaign with Chelsea this season

The World Cup comes at the end of a busy domestic season for many of the England squad. Sterling, Sturridge and Cahill were appearing in their 45th, 42nd and 58th appearances of 2013-14 respectively.

Liverpool youngster Sterling, who was employed in a No 10 role by Roy Hodgson tonight, went down clutching his hamstring on the hour mark, after sprinting to retrieve a pass.

Glen Johnson and Italy players Giorgio Chiellini and Claudio Marchisio were on hand to help ease the 19-year-old’s cramp, and he was soon back on his feet.

Sterling had started the game brightly for England, with many thinking he had put Hodgson’s side ahead with a rising drive in the fourth minute that flew into the side netting of Salvatore Sirigu’s goal.

He continued to torment Italy for much of the first half, before his performance dipped after the break, particularly in the final half an hour after he went down with cramp.

Sturridge and Cahill also needed help from the England bench after going down with similar muscle pain towards the end of the game.

Battling: It was a tough night for some of England's players who have endured long club seasons

The Barclays Premier League is the only one of Europe’s top five leagues that does not have a winter break to ease the physical pressure on players over the course of the season.

Spain, Italy and France all have a fortnight’s break over the Christmas period, while in Germany the Bundesliga stops for a month.
