Being Pope can get lonely sometimes. 

But Francis found some young friends to keep him company yesterday,  when he picked up two hitchhikers in his Pope-mobile.

Delighted 11-year-old schoolboys Livio Bastianelli and Davide Maria Bianchi toured St Peter’s Square in Francis’ white jeep, waving to the crowds.

At the end of his regular Wednesday Angelus prayer as Francis began his tour of the square he saw a group of Italian children.

After ordering his driver to stop so he could chat with them he invited the two boys in matching white caps to join him for the jaunt.

Looking amazed to find themselves in the companionship of the pontiff, the thrilled schoolboys sat in the backseat smiling at first nervously, then waving to the crowd.

'How do like this change of plan?' Francis asked them.

The three soon stopped off again to share a packet of crisps and a cool drink offered by some other children.

Francis has made it clear that he has an aversion to being on his own, preferring to live with others in the Saint Martha’s guesthouse rather than the grand Apostolic Palaces.

He said he has chosen to live among his brothers for 'psychiatric reasons'.

'It's not just a question of riches but also a personality issue. I need to live among people and if I lived on my own, perhaps a little isolated, it wouldn't do me good,' he said.

The pontiff is known for his spontaneous gestures, sometimes taking unprompted walkabouts which cause a headache for his security detail.

At last weekend’s Palm Sunday celebration he hopped off the still-moving jeep to mingle with the crowd and pose for selfies with teenagers from Poland.
