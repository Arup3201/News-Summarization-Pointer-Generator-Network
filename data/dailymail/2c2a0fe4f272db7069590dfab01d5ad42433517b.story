Circuit Court Judge Fred Borchard says the shooting was not just a for the whole community.

'You pull out a gun and try to blow them or blast them away, you could have been killed, instead you shoot one another, you end up shooting other people like the O.K. Corral, only it's done with innocent people in between you,' he said.

Thomas was sentenced to life in prison, but with the possibility of parole.

'I'm shocked about the life sentence, but it's not in my hands, its not up to me, sorry for them for the life, but a life was taken,' she said.
