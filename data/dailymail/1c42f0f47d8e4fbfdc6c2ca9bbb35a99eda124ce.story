Leeds have staved off a winding-up order from former director Melvyn Levi.

Leeds-based law firm Ford & Warren last week filed the petition for unpaid fees - reported to be around £150,000 and dating back to when Ken Bates owned the club - on behalf of Levi.

Bates, 82, sold Leeds to Bahrain-based investment firm Gulf Finance House Capital in December 2012 and the club changed ownership again in April this year when Italian businessman Massimo Cellino completed his takeover.

The petition was served in relation to unpaid court fees. A case involving Levi was struck out in 2012 with the judge in the case ordering that Levi's fees be paid by the club.

A statement from Leeds read: 'The winding-up petition presented by Melvyn Levi has been dismissed on agreed terms.

'Mr Levi and Leeds United Football Club Limited are working towards resolving their remaining differences.'
