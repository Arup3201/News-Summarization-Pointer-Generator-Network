Cricket’s crackdown on throwing claimed its highest-profile victim in Saeed Ajmal on Tuesday, before it was revealed that on-field testing could soon be brought in to finally rid the world game of the chuckers.

The International Cricket Council, long derided as a toothless governing body, caused a stir when they banned the best spinner in the world. It is part of a concerted campaign against chucking which has also seen Sri Lanka’s Sachithra Senanayake and New Zealand’s Kane Williamson stopped from bowling.

Pakistan and Worcestershire spinner Ajmal was reported for a second time after the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle. In a move which has ramifications for the international and domestic game, he faces a public fight for his future.

Ban: Ajmal has been banned indefinitely by the ICC for an illegal bowling action done in Brisbane

Muttiah Muralitharan

Despite holding the all-time record of 800 Test wickets, the Sri Lankan’s action has always been controversial. Though never suspended, Muralitharan was called for chucking on numerous occasions throughout his career. He even went on TV to bowl with a special cast on to try to prove his innocence.

Shoaib Akhtar

The Pakistani paceman was suspended by the ICC in December 1999 but had his ban lifted almost immediately. Akhtar was regularly bowling around 95mph but there were concerns about the straightening of his arm before sending down a bouncer or a quicker ball.

Brett Lee

The Australian fast bowler emerged at a similar time to Akhtar and his speed raised similar suspicions of an illegal action. But the ICC cleared him in the summer of 2000.

Marlon Samuels

As well as being banned in 2008 over a match-fixing scandal, the part-time West Indies offspinner was prohibited from bowling quick deliveries in international cricket due to his action.

Ajmal, who earlier this season bowled Worcestershire to a formidable position in the race for second division promotion, is adamant he can prove his innocence in time for February’s World Cup.

‘It is very disappointing but I’m a fighter and I know what I have to do to get back before the World Cup,’ said Ajmal, 36. All of his deliveries, not just the doosra, were found to be illegal after biomechanical tests in Brisbane.

‘The ban is not a problem for me. The ICC have stopped me from bowling because my elbow is bending beyond the 15 degrees allowed and I know I can correct that. My elbow is not usual. That’s why I seem to bend it more.’

Yet Ajmal, who blamed a car accident which damaged his elbow the first time he was reported for throwing five years ago, will have to fight back the hard way once ICC plans for sensors that can be worn during matches to identify throwing are introduced. These are at the final stage of testing in Brisbane.

Players will wear two sensors on the back of the arm near the elbow in an attempt to provide more accurate results than those garnered by laboratories away from match conditions.

Ajmal is a popular figure who has proved both a mentor and an inspiration to England’s Moeen Ali. There was widespread sympathy for a man who has proved a magician in the Muttiah Muralitharan mould, provides no danger to batsmen and has been the highest wicket-taker in world cricket across all formats in the last three years. Yet there are plenty who will welcome this move as he has long been suspected of throwing — not least privately by England when he bowled them to a 3-0 Test whitewash two years ago.

Only this season Michael Vaughan posted a picture on Twitter of Ajmal bowling for Worcestershire with the former England captain and Stuart Broad then apparently questioning the validity of the Pakistani’s action.

There will also be those who question the validity of Worcestershire’ s probable promotion after Ajmal’s leading role in taking 63 wickets as their overseas player before leaving for international duty.

Ajmal added a yorker fired in at 70mph to his repertoire this season and that has caused consternation because of its ability to bamboozle top order players who were simply unable to pick it.

Essex are one of the counties likely to miss out on promotion because of Worcestershire’s success but there were no complaints from their coach Paul Grayson. He said on Tuesday: ‘Worcestershire have played some very good cricket this season and they are far from a one-man band.

‘The last thing I want to be accused of is sour grapes by complaining now but what I would question is why none of the county umpires reported Saeed. This only came to light when he went off to play for Pakistan.’

Ajmal will almost certainly miss Pakistan’s Test series against Australia next month while he undergoes remedial action but will take heart from the fact that he was cleared the last time this happened. In 2009, testing in Perth found that Ajmal’s elbow has a 23.5 degree bend.

Yet, with the ICC deciding that throwing is a major problem among spinners, and not just ‘mystery’ ones, a man who turns 37 next month faces a race against time if he is to be seen at the highest level again.
