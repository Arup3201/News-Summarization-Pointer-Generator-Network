Jackie Mason took a chunk of Obama's 'tukhus' for misleading the public about his signature health insurance overhaul

Jackie Mason, the aging comedian best known for his borscht-belt Jewish schtick, slammed President Obama on Sunday as a compulsive liar who sounds 'like a maniac in an asylum' when he talks about health care.

'He's saying things that nobody believes,' said Mason, 82, during an interview broadcast on WABC radio in New York.

'He was always lying every day of his life. Every time he talks it was a lie. The only time he tells the truth is when you didn't hear from him.'

Mason took issue with Obama's repeated pledge that Americans who wanted to keep their health insurance plans would be able to do so even after the Affordable Care Act became law.

The Washington Post has since awarded that promise its dreaded 'four Pinocchios' rating, the least-truthful grade its fact-checker offers.

'This is becoming so ridiculous, that even the biggest liar can’t top himself,' Mason said of Obama, the conservative World Net Daily website was first to report.

'He looks at you straight in the face, and tells you that if you want your plan, you got your plan, you keep your plan. Now, a month and a half later, you got no plan, you lost your plan, and he tells you you still got a plan.'

'It's such a ridiculous thing,' he added. 'The whole country's walking around wondering if this guy's really the president of a country. He sounds more like a maniac in an asylum.'

'If this is a president of a country, how come he's the only one in America who doesn't seem to know what's going on here?'

Mason said he believes Obama's multiple statements that 'If you like your plan, you can keep your plan' are lies, not simple misstatements, as a weekend New York Times editorial alleged.

'Never did I expect a guy like this – the head of a country – to blatantly lie to your face,' he said, 'and then not only lie to your face, then lie about the fact that he never lied. Then lie again about the next lie he told.'

Obama, said Mason, is 'the only guy in America who would have the nerve to lie this much.'

Sunday's comments weren't the first time Mason has made headlines for attacking the president.

During a stand-up performance in 2009 he referred to Obama using the Yiddish word 'schvartze,' which some commentators took as an outdated racial epithet.

Others, including Mason, contended that the word is simply a literal translation of the word 'black.'

'Chris Rock has told a lot more jokes about whites than I have against blacks,' the cnoservative comic later said. 'What about the demeaning words blacks say about Jews? If it's a racist society, the white people are the ones being persecuted because they have to defend themselves.'

Mason has never been a shrinking violet, but has become more and more vocal about his dislike of President Obama

In 2001 Mason attacked the president for holding a White House Hanukkah observance 12 days early so it wouldn't interrupt his family vacation.

'The way I see it,' Obama had said, 'we're just extending the holiday spirit. We're stretching it out. But we do have to be careful that your kids don't start thinking Hanukkah lasts 20 nights instead of eight. That will cause some problems.'

Mason fired back.

'I don't even think he knew that he was talking about something that's Jewish,' he said days later. 'It could have been Muslim, it could have been altogether a religion he never even heard of. He doesn't know, he doesn't care. He's strictly in there to take a picture, and the picture could have been about anything

He claimed that the president only held the event because his Jewish advisors had told him '"Hanukkah is a good idea"' if he wanted to increase his appeal to Jewish voters in the following year's election.

'"You don't have to go any place,"' he imagined them saying. '"We'll put down the tchotchke and you'll see a candle, you'll light it from this side," and that's enough information for him to accumulate without a teleprompter. So he did it in 10 minutes.'

'You want me to tell you the truth?' he said then. 'I don’t think he cares, or knows or remembers which Hanukkah it is, or what Hanukkah means.'

In 2012 Mason attacked Obama after his open-mic gaffe and was heard telling Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would have more 'flexibility' in his policymaking after he was re-elected.

The president, he claimed, had showed himself to be 'a fake and a fraud' who 'hates this country.'

He also called Obama a 'completely crooked lowlife' after news reports claimed the White House had leaked Israel's plan for military attacks against Iran just weeks before last year's election.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later said that those attacks were called off at the Obama administration's request.

'A guy like this should be locked up,' Mason said Sunday.

'If he wasn’t the president, he’d be in jail or in a sanitarium. He wouldn’t be outside talking to people in this condition. He would be considered a danger to his own his own health, to his own life.'
