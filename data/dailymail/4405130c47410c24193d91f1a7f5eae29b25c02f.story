Veteran actor George Cole has become ‘deeply depressed’ over a dispute with a neighbour at his idyllic rural retreat, his wife claimed yesterday.

The 88-year-old, who starred as loveable rogue Arthur Daley in Minder, is said to be sick with worry at a saw mill being built next to his home of 70 years.

He is already fighting illness and his wife Penny, 75, fears the row has made him worse.

Battle: George Cole and his wife Penny have started legal action against local businessman James Morris

The couple and other villagers in Stoke Row, Oxfordshire, have launched legal action to try to stop local businessman James Morris, 44.

He has started to build a metal barn 20ft high and 90ft long for his saw mill business which the district council has ruled does not need planning permission.

Mrs Cole blamed the dispute for an agonising skin condition and heart palpitations which she is suffering. She added that her doctor has prescribed valium to combat the stress.

‘This is the last thing we  need. It has made us both unwell,’ she said.

‘George has fallen and knocked himself and he is on hefty medication for other health problems. This is shaking what he values.

‘He has always been very quiet and needs peace and quiet. Otherwise he wouldn’t have lived here for 70 years.

‘This is our safe place and suddenly it isn’t any more. We can’t get away from it. Our master bedroom and sitting area face towards it.

‘At our age, we do not socialise except with our children and grandchildren. We never go away – we are always here.’

Protesters said beautiful trees will be hacked down, the mill will be an eyesore and noisy machinery will ruin the rural peace.

Mr Morris runs a saw mill business two miles away in Nettlebed and lives yards from the Coles. He said he needs the machinery in the barn at his home to chop up trees.

But Mrs Cole said: ‘The building looks like an escapee from an industrial estate. The problem is the planning department didn’t realise it would be quite so obtrusive and out of place.

‘It doesn’t nestle in the side of the hill and he has built on the plateau it stands on, so it is  visible from every angle from the open lane.’ 

The couple have taken on law firm Withers to challenge South Oxfordshire council’s decision that the building does not need planning permission. The firm said the ruling was ‘deeply flawed and unlawful’.

A spokesman added: ‘The council made
 a gross error in failing to protect our clients’  residential amenity 
in allowing the saw mill to begin with.

‘In so doing, it failed to have any regard to the noise implications of the proposal.’ 

The Coles and other neighbours are backed by planning consultant Nick Groves, who has lodged an objection with the authority.

But
 a council spokesman said: ‘A forestry building has been allowed on the 
site on the basis that it falls within permitted development rights.

‘The council was satisfied that the proposed siting, design and external appearance of the  building was acceptable.’

Mrs Cole added: ‘We are having a bit of a struggle but we are putting our faith in the council and they said they would investigate.’ 

Her husband of 49 years has appeared in countless films and TV series in a career spanning more than six decades.

One of the best known was Minder, in which he starred with Dennis Waterman from 1979 to 1994. Mr Cole also acted alongside Sir Laurence Olivier in the film The Demi Paradise in 1943.

Mr Morris was not available  for comment.
