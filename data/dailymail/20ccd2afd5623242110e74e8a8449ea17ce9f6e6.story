Militant preacher Anjem Choudary has been identified as a leading British influence for the Al Qaeda-linked terrorists who carried out the Kenya shopping mall atrocity, it emerged yesterday.

London-based Choudary, who has been linked to dozens of terrorist suspects, is highlighted in a video issued by East African group Al-Shabaab.

The video also says 11 Britons have died waging jihad in Somalia.

One of the leading figures in Al-Shabaab – blamed for last month’s Nairobi attack which left 67 dead – is ‘white widow’ Samantha Lewthwaite. The whereabouts of Lewthwaite, former wife of 7/7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay, remains a mystery.

Counter-terrorism detectives at 
Scotland Yard, who have been on a heightened state of alert following 
the Kenyan outrage, are examining the 58-minute video by Al-Shabaab 
which endorses Choudary.

Called ‘Woolwich Attack: It’s an Eye 
for an Eye’, the English-language production urges Muslims in Britain to
 go to Somalia to fight jihad or carry out terror attacks in the UK if 
they are unable to travel.

It is the first such propaganda video to be entirely focused on recruiting Britons and inciting terror attacks in the UK.

The content of much of the video 
cannot be reported because of legal reporting restrictions and laws that
 forbid the incitement of terrorism.

Choudary, 46, features significantly 
in the video and is lauded as a ‘Caller to Islam’, marking the first 
time that he has been publicly endorsed by Al Qaeda.

It suggested that he and a militant 
colleague based in North-West London are the main points of contact for 
Muslims eager to wage jihad in Somalia or Britain.

Choudary is seen blaming British 
foreign policy for terrorist attacks in the UK and warning of more 
attacks. In a clip from the video – thought to be taken from the 
internet – he says: ‘The Government want people to swallow something 
that is completely nonsensical, it doesn’t make any sense: their foreign
 policy has had a direct impact on the streets of London.’

The narrator is believed to be a 
Briton who uses the name Abu Omar, who claimed that Muslims had turned 
to jihad as ‘the only viable solution to counter the crusades engulfing 
the entire Muslim world’.
  Scotland Yard said: ‘We are aware of the video and we are assessing its contents.’

Turning point: Mohammed Ansar, 39, made a BBC film about ex-English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, who he famously hugged in the aftermath of Lee Rigby's killing

Mohammed Ansar, 39, a British documentary film-maker and journalist was one of the figures singled out in the hour-long video.

Police visited him on Wednesday evening to discuss safety arrangement for him and his family following the film's release.

He also made a BBC film about ex-English 
Defence League leader Tommy Robinson, who he famously hugged in the 
aftermath of the killing.

The
 video is not widely available on the internet, but it opens with the 
narrator of the film, who has a British accent, praising the death of Lee Rigby and inciting others in the UK to carry out similar attacks.

Targets: Other figures threatened in the video include broadcaster Ajmal Masroor

Harar 24, which saw a version of the film reported: 'In the video certain Muslim scholars and community leaders are referred to as being on the “government’s payroll” for speaking against the Woolwich attack and “distancing themselves from the mujahideen" '.

'Al-Shabaab in the video claims that the Woolwich attack was a result of British foreign policy, for killing Muslims and for aiding the United States in their “war of terror”' 

The narrator of the film, wearing a 
black mask and holding an automatic weapon, tells viewers 'Do not 
waste your time trying to re-invent the wheel.

'If you can’t afford to get hold of [a gun] then certainly a simple knife from your local B&Q will do the job.'

He told followers to 'cut the necks of the disbelievers.'

Mr Ansar told the Guardian that police were now regularly patrolling his residence and keeping in contacting by phoning every hour.

'If
 they [jihadists] are going to start targeting British Muslims and set 
fanatical extremists against them then that is a frightening new 
dimension,' he said.

On his
 Twitter page Mr Ansar wrote this morning: 'My family and I would like 
to thank the wonderful @HantsPolice and @HantsChiefAndy all their hard 
work and diligence. '

Other
 figures threatened in the video include Usama Hasan, a senior 
researcher with the anti-extremist Quilliam Foundation and the imam and 
broadcaster Ajmal Masroor.

Mr
 Masroor wrote on his Facebook page that he was visited by police 
officers from Scotland Yard this week after he had put his children to 
bed.

Imam and broadcaster Ajmal Masroor was one of the figures threatened in the video. He wrote this post on Facebook

He said he was told his life was in danger when they showed him a piece of paper.

'The basic message contained in the paragraph was that my life was in imminent danger from the terrorists. The police officers were visiting me to give me a warning and asking me to be more vigilant. They were being the messengers. They left me a telephone number to call in case of emergency or if I felt under any immediate danger. They did not give me any further details and left me guessing.

'As soon as they left my house I started digging further and found an Al-Shabab video has been uploaded on the Internet and in it they name me as a Muslim who is an enemy of Islam and should be eliminated.

'They name a few others in their video message and encourage people to resort to using knives to behead people like me. I spend some time today to verify the threat and it was confirmed to me that it was this video that had spurred our security services to action.'

The video is thought to have been filmed before last month's massacre at a Kenya mall which left at least 67 people dead.

The
 Somali Islamic group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the assault 
and said it was in retaliation for Kenya sending troops into neighboring
 Somalia.

Scotland Yard told the MailOnline: 'We are aware of the video that has been released and we are currently assessing it's contents.'
