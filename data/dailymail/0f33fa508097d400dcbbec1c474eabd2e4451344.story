After nearly two years spent in captivity in Syria, American journalist Peter Theo Curtis finally touched down on U.S. soil Tuesday and was reunited with his family. 

The joyous homecoming came two days after Curtis was released by Syrian extremists who have been holding him hostage.

A Curtis family spokesman told WCVB that the 45-year-old journalist landed in Newark International Airport on a plane from Tel Aviv late Tuesday afternoon.

Curtis then took a connecting flight to Logan Airport in Boston, where he was welcomed by his mother, Nancy.

‘I have been so touched and moved, beyond all words, by the people who have come up to me today -- strangers on the airplane, the flight attendants, and most of all, my family to say welcome home,’ Peter Curtis was quoted as saying.

Curtis expressed his gratitude to various U.S. officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who helped secure his freedom, and to the government of Qatar for brokering a deal with his captors.

‘I'm overwhelmed with relief that this day has come and my son is standing beside me,’ Nancy Curtis said. ‘But this is a sober occasion because of the events of the past week. My heart goes out to the other families who are suffering.’

So excited: Nancy Curtis, pictured Monday, said she spoke with her son Peter Theo Curtis on the phone and he was 'so excited' to be free

Mrs Curtis added to CNN outside her home that no one was in the mood to celebrate in the aftermath of the tragic death of kidnapped American journalist James Foley, who was beheaded by ISIS last week. A video of the gruesome execution was released online, sending shockwaves around the world.  

Speaking in an interview aired Monday morning on GMA, Nancy Curtis' face lit up as she described the first time she heard Peter's voice again.

'I spoke with him briefly yesterday, he was so excited,' she told reporter Amy Robach from her Cambridge, Massachusetts home. 

'He said "Mom, they're being so nice to me. They are putting me up in a 12 star hotel and I am drinking a beer and there are women,"' Nancy Curtis said.

She also explained with a smile that there are a few things her son needs to catch up on, having been out of the loop for so long.

She said he didn't even know that President Barack Obama had been reelected. 

He was kidnapped in October 2012.

However, when the interview turned to James Foley, Mrs Curtis turned emotional.

She said she sent an e-mail to Foley's mother, Diane Foley, upon learning that her own son was safe and on his way home.

'We've been through so much together,' Nancy Curtis said, tears glistening in her eyes.

'I didn't want her to hear it from the media first.'

The U.S. citizen had been held hostage by an al-Qaida linked group in Syria since October 2012 

Mrs Curtis described in the interview how life was like while the 45-year-old was being held in Syria, and said she's still in that desperate mode despite his release. 

Curtis, a freelance journalist writing about the Middle East under the pen name Peter Padnos, was handed to UN representatives Sunday after being held by Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front, near Aleppo for the past 22 months.

'When something like this happens you shut down you live in the present, you get through each day, each 15 minutes,' she said in snippet of the interview that aired earlier on ABC.

'I don't look back, I don't look forward. I deal with things as they come. And I'm still in that mode.' 

Tears: Mrs Curtis teared up when she spoke of James Foley and his parents, who have become her friends

But she had thought about the first thing she'll do when she sees him.

'I'll give him a big hug and I'll probably cry and he'll probably cry,' she said.

Mrs Curtis' words come after the journalist's father, Michael Padnos, praised his son for his bravery.

He said his son and others who venture into dangerous lands like Syria deserve respect for wanting to 'bear witness ... tell the truth about what's going on.'

Padnos, who lives on a boat outside Paris, said in an interview with the Associated Press that the interminable search and wait for his son had been like 'hunting for bats in a dark, black cave.'
