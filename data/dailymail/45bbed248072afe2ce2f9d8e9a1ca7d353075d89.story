Supermarkets yesterday cut their fuel prices by up to 3p a litre.

Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons acted within 24 hours of oil prices falling on the international markets.

The
move is likely to force oil companies such as BP and Shell to follow 
suit, especially in areas where they have a cut-price competitor.

Taking a lead: Tesco slashed 3p off a litre of petrol with Asda and Sainsbury's quickly following suit

It
will offer some respite to motorists who have seen average prices of 
around 136p a litre for petrol and 140p a litre for diesel.

The
cuts follow the decision by the International Energy Agency to open 
emergency reserves to reduce the risk of shortages or price increases.

The
move was seen as ‘a shot across the bows’ of the Arab-dominated oil 
cartel Opec which has an interest in keeping prices high.

Oil dropped by up to $8 a barrel, which should equate to a 4p a litre fall at the pumps.

AA
president Edmund King said: ‘We welcome this rapid 3p reduction in fuel
prices and hope that other retailers will follow this lead.

‘This will help the general economy to recover, as lower prices at the pumps means more spending elsewhere.’

RAC
motoring strategist, Adrian Tink, added: ‘This looks like it’s the 
start of price war at the pumps which can only be good news for 
motorists.’

Earlier
this week reports by the AA and RAC revealed that the price of fuel was
forcing motorists to dramatically cut back on journeys. Tesco UK chief 
executive Richard Brasher said of the company’s 3p a litre cut: ‘We know
our customers are feeling the pinch at the moment so we want to pass on
the benefit of a fall in oil prices straight away.’

Asda
is cutting prices by up to 3p a litre from today at its 180 forecourts.
It said drivers will not pay more than 130.7p a litre for petrol and 
not more than 134.7p a litre for diesel.

Sainsbury’s
said it was cutting prices by up to 3p a litre from midnight last 
night. A spokesman said: ‘We know that consumer budgets are stretched.’

Morrisons said it had dropped prices by up to 3p at its 296 filling stations.

BP said it set its prices from site to site, depending on the level of local competition.

AA
fuel market expert Luke Bosdet noted: ‘Tesco’s participation in a price
war is significant because of their large number of fuel stations.’

He
added: ‘A 3p drop in the price of petrol switches £1.8million a day 
from petrol sales to other consumer spending, helping high street 
businesses.’
