British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood used her packed London Fashion Week showcase to  pledge her undivided support of the Yes campaign for Scottish independence.

Sending models sporting Yes badges down the runway, the designer left a statement explaining her views on every seat in the packed venue.

Later brandishing Better Together campaigners as 'frightened and stupid', Dame Vivienne said tearing the 307-year-old union apart could be 'the turning point towards a better world'.

Sending models down the runway sporting Yes badges, the designer said she hopes Alex Salmond's campaign wins on Thursday when millions of Scots turn out to vote 

Guests at her show this afternoon found a small statement printed on each of their seats, explaining her views on the impending referendum. 

'I am so excited. Fingers crossed they will win. Because if they do, it could be the turning point towards a better world. 

'They could lead by example,' it read.

Later, when asked by reporters why she felt Alex Salmond's campaign for an independent Scotland was best for the country, she said: 'I hate England.'

'I like Scotland because somehow I think they are better than we are. They are more democratic,' she said, later brandishing those voting to stay in the UK in Thursday's vote as 'frightened and stupid'. 

Westwood is renowned for using tartan in almost all of her collections. 

Although she was born in Glossop, Derbyshire to English parents, Westwood  created her own Scottish clan and tartan for her 'Anglomania' Autumn/Winter fashion line in 1993.

Named MacAndreas after her third husband and collaborator Andreas Kronthaler, the clan's tartan was accepted by the Lochcarron of Scotland within months - despite the process of recognition traditionally taking about 200 years.

As a result she is the only contemporary designer to have her work displayed at the Lochcarron Museum of Tartan. 

The designer has used tartan in almost all of her collections to date and was recently welcomed into the Scottish Fashion Awards Hall of Fame for her contribution to the textiles and fabric industry in Scotland 

In a 1989 issue of Tatler, Vivienne Westwood appeared on the magazine's cover dressed in a suit she had made for then prime minister Margaret Thatcher.

Her flame-hair conservatively coiffed, beneath the designer's image were the word: 'This woman used to be a punk'. 

The edition has been hailed as one of the best British magazine covers of all time. 

Years later, she sent a model down the catwalk yielding a sign in support of the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay. 

It read: 'Fair trial my a***! Justice for the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Reprieve'  

Slowing down climate change and preventing fracking are other causes dear to the designer's heart. 

Elsewhere she has been pictured at Occupy London protests and visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy.

Sourcing the tartan patterns used in her designs from all over Scotland, she was welcomed into the Scottish Fashion Awards Hall of Fame earlier this month for her 'undeterred loyalty' to the industry. 

Receiving her award, she said: '[An independent Scotland could be] a model to us all. . . if it could become a people-friendly society.

'Surely you can still have the queen and be the United Kingdom, if we win, you can be our friends if you wanted, it’s up to you.

'I think it’s absolutely great that almost half, it would be great if even a half, were getting the other half, a half of Scottish people want democracy.'

Speaking at the time, Tessa Hartmann, the founder of the awards, said: 'Vivienne has had an undeterred loyalty and unparalleled love and passion for Scottish textiles and fabrics, which she has consistently used within her collections throughout the years. 

'She personifies the powerful and subversive originality of British fashion and has done more for Scottish textiles than probably any other designer of her generation. 

'Her brand name is synonymous with the tartan pattern and her fascination for this iconic fabric is unrelenting. 

Pro-independence voters gathered at a concert in Edinburgh's Usher Hall to watch Scottish artists Amy McDonald, Franz Ferdinand and Frightened Rabbit

'By using a mix of different tartans, her ensembles explore the rich depth of colour and diversity of the traditional checked pattern that is adored around the world.' 

Hundreds of pro-independence campaigners gathered in Edinburgh this evening for a concert. 

Scottish artists such as Franz Ferdinand, Frightened Rabbit and Amy McDonald will perform at the event. 

A combination of varying polls found the No campaign to claim a slight lead with 51 per cent today. However with an estimated 500,000 Scots still unsure of their vote, the race has been described as too close to call.
