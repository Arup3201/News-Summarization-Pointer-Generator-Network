A new Yorkshire challenger is emerging in the Daily Mail Schools Trophy this season following the success last year of Bradford-based Woodhouse Grove.

While the champions have slipped up once in three games, Grammar School at Leeds (GSAL) are the early unbeaten leaders this time around.

Four tries from centre Tom Gorman was the highlight of the Leeds team's latest success over Durham, 46-10, in the merit-table based competition organised by schoolsrugby.co.uk. This demolition followed on from wins over St Peter's (York), 59-7 and Ampleforth 66-7.

Gorman is part of a squad who have been playing together throughout their secondary school years. Their biggest success so far was winning the national under-15s cup three years ago, against St Joseph's, which included a hat-trick from the centre.

John Mackenzie, director of rugby ay GSAL, rated the win over Durham to be the best this season. 'The conditions were pretty poor so we had to adapt and play a little bit tighter than we had in the previous games. It was a very pleasing performance,' he said.

Gorman was backed up by two tries from wing Chris Bridge while the forward effort was led by lock Harry Francis and captain Sam Ward at hooker.

Grove, who had their unbeaten record in the competition taken by St Peter's, regained form by beating QEGS Wakefield, 20-0. 

Epsom College, also unbeaten in three games, are leading the southern challenge. 

They are maintaining the good form which brought an outstanding 2013-14 season. A win over Cranleigh, 28-7, featured two tries from flanker George Mount.

Another outstanding individual effort came from Clifton College's versatile Tom Beck. The No 8 or centre, who captains the Bristol academy, scored three tries in a 28-20 win over Bryanston.

Bradford-based Woodhouse Grove are the reigning champions but have lost one of their first three games

Clifton, who had also beaten Pate's GS and King's College Taunton, spoiled the good start by losing on Tuesday evening to Kingswood School of Bath, 30-10.

Besides counting for Trophy points, the match was played in memory of Ryan Bresnahan, the Clifton pupil, who died from meningitis in March 2010.
