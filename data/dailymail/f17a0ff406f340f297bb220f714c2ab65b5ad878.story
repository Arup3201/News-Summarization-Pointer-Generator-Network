The suicide note of a Republican activist has been released a month after he killed himself while awaiting trial for the rapes of five women.

Gregory Nathan Peterson, 37, who was facing  multiple charges of rape, assault and kidnapping, took his own life at his remote Utah log cabin on October 23.

The five-page, handwritten suicide note was released by his lawyers this weekend at the request of Peterson and his family.

In the note, he protested his innocence and blamed the women who accused him, saying 'this was a case about regret, not rape'.

Final letter: Gregory Nathan Peterson, 37, wrote a five-page, suicide note in the minutes before he killed himself in Utah after being accused of raping five women

Peterson also blamed prosecutors and the media for conspiring against him, saying that suicide was his only option.

The letter reads: 'To my family/friends, someday, albeit not now, I believe you’ll see I’m doing the right thing by ending the extraordinary pain to you, and exposing lies & injustices. I love you all very much. I’ll miss you.'

He denied that he was responsible for the multiple felonies for which he faced decades in jail.

On paper with his letterhead, he wrote: 'I love life. I never kidnapped, raped or burglarized anyone.'

He named the women with a supposed vendetta against him. Their names have been blacked out in the long letter before it was released. 

The wealthy businessman accused one alleged victim of feeling guilty about having sex, while another was manipulating him for her green card.

Peterson said that he had been falsely accused by the five women and wanted to 'make my accusers famous', urging that a wrongful death suit be pursued by his loved ones.

The family waited until after the businessman's memorial to make the letter public this weekend. They released the note in the hope of salvaging his reputation, attorneys told the Salt Lake Tribune.

You have the blood of an innocent man on your hands.

Gregory Nathan Peterson's suicide letter

The DA's office in Salt Lake County 
said that Peterson's case had been handled like any other and they had 
decided to go trial because there was enough evidence and testimony 
against him.

Peterson was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head last month after bail bond agents were dispatched 
to his home in Heber when his ankle monitor stopped responding.

He committed suicide at the Utah cabin 
where the crimes allegedly took place. Peterson, 37, had been out on 
$2million bail 
since October 19 and was to stand trial on 23 felony charges and two 
misdemeanor counts. The men found Peterson's body in an upstairs 
bedroom.

Four women from Salt Lake County and 
one from Wasatch County testified at a hearing in August that Peterson 
sexually assaulted them at his cabin. He is accused of meeting them on Mormon dating websites and at church functions.

Two of the women said they had met Peterson on dating website LDSsingles.com. One woman had arranged a date with him - claiming he looked like 'a great catch' in his 
profile and had come recommended by a Mormon temple.

Peterson, a certified public 
accountant and the owner of Peterson Wealth Management, was a 
fixture at Utah Republican gatherings.

He helped organize the Rocky Mountain Conservatives Convention and Barbecue two years ago at his Heber cabin.

Prominent Utah politicians hosted by 
Peterson included Senator Orrin Hatch, Governor Gary Herbert, 
Representative Jason Chaffetz and congressional candidate Mia Love.

While Peterson has been involved in 
state politics and events, Utah Republican Chairman Thomas Wright has 
said he never held a leadership role or raised or donated money for the 
state party.
