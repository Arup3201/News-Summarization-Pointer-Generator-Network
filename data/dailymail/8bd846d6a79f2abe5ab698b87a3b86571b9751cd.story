Anyone who knows anything will tell you, plucky paddler Evan Garcia is making a real splash on the kayaking scene.

The 23-year-old enjoys nothing more than plunging over the world's tallest waterfalls in just a plastic canoe.

And as this incredible sequence of pictures show, his latest leap over Outlet Falls in Washington State could be his most oar-inspiring stunt yet.

Oar-inspiring: This is the heart-in-mouth moment plucky paddler Evan Garcia kayaker plummets 70ft down Outlet Falls in Washington State, USA

Outlet Falls is 70 feet of thrashing water hurtling into Outlet Creek.

The drop took three seconds from top to bottom and was captured by Garcia's friend and filmmaker Andy Maser from a nearby cliff top.

The incredible sequence of shots shows Garcia throwing his oar away and bracing for impact.

Outlet Falls is a 69 foot plunging waterfall where Outlet Creek

huge bowl as the creek erodes its way into the Klickitat Canyon.

Outlet Creek is fed by several springfed tributaries that flow off Mount Adams in Washington State.

Early beginnings: Garcia learned the sport from his father who owned a kayak shop in Bozeman, MT, where he grew up

Making history: Film maker Andy Maser, who captured Evan Garcia's daredevil stunt at Outlet Falls in Washington State
