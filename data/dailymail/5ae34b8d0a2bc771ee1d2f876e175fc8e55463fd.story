Asian needle ants, an aggressive species with painful stings, is on the march, winning territory from Argentine ants, the U.S.'s most famous invasive species.

The Asian ants are not just a worry for the Argentine ants, but also for humans. They cause itchy bites on people that can cause anaphylactic shock, a severe reaction that can result in death, if the person is allergic.

Argentine ants were very successful as an an invasive species, spreading across the country with their territorial behaviour and super-colonies, having arrived in the U.S. in the 19th century.Â

Battle of the ants: Asian needle ants, right, are pushing out Argentine ants, left. Researchers predict that the more aggressive Asian ants, which have painful bites, could be the next big foreign ant invasion in the U.S.

For a long time, they have been the dominant invasive species, but now Asian ants are displacing them.

Unusually the Argentines have not been fighting the newcomers, letting them gain ground quickly in pockets everywhere from Alabama to New York to Oregon.

Lead author of the research into this ant influx, Eleanor Spicer Rice at North Carolina University, said the Asian ants could be the next major ant invasion.

Dr Spicer Rice began to investigate after she noticed Asian ants winning turf over the Argentines in a North Carolina office park.

Normally the territorial Argentine species do not having any other species of ant nearby, so Dr Spicer 
Rice decided to investigate.

The researchers believe the Asian 
ants have an advantage over the Argentines because they are active in 
cool weather, whereas the Argentine ant rests until spring.

The Asian ants start building new nests around March, whereas the Argentine ants start in late April or May, giving them a headstart every year.

Dr Spicer Rice said that they are very likely to continue their advance as a species. 'The Asian needle ant is moving into forests and urban environments.

'Because it is active at cooler temperatures, it could move into a very broad range of territory.'

Unlike the Asian variety, Argentine ants do not pose a direct threat to humans.

Argentine ants have also appeared in greater numbers in Britain, taking advantage of balmier summers.
