It certainly looks a little more impressive than the sort of Guy Fawkes Night celebration you might find in your local park on November 5 each year.

Chinese blacksmiths can be seen in these extraordinary photographs throwing molten metal against a cold stone wall to create sparks for a festival.

They gathered in Nuanquan, Hebei province, to celebrate the Lantern Festival, which traditionally marks the end of festivities for the Lunar New Year.

In their style: While the blacksmiths were present in Nuanquan, in other areas of the country some people marked the festival with a dragon dance parade

The village is well known for its master blacksmiths and has been celebrating in this style for 300 years, which helps cut the cost of buying fireworks.

But much of the country celebrated the festival with fireworks and food, with railway officials predicting 6.4million people would take the train yesterday.

Beijing officials even urged revellers to reduce the numbers of fireworks they were setting off, reported the Agence France-Presse news agency.
