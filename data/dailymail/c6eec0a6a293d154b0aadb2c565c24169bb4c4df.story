Concerns: Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the only thing that would bury his party would be if they were linked to a 'racist age', it emerged today

Nigel Farage believes the only thing that would 'bury' Ukip is if the public link his party to a 'racist age', new documents revealed today.

The firebrand politician spoke out after a councillor was accused of publishing an offensive post on Facebook calling for 'free-loading', 'benefit-grabbing', 'illegal immigrants' to 'go home'.

Minutes from a UKIP meeting in 2013 to discuss the suspension of Chris Pain  reveal how Mr Farage said that comments like that would help sink the party.

He said: 'The one thing that is able to bury the Party if (sic) they can link us with a racist age', according to the Daily Telegraph.

Mr Farage added the comments showed a 'grave error of judgement', although Mr Pain always said the post was put up by a hacker and police dropped an investigation against him because of a lack of evidence to prosecute. 

The comments reveal that Mr Farage and the party leadership feared being linked to any type of racism, as the Tories and Labour continue to suggest UKIP is old fashioned and out of touch. 

In a piece for the Mail on Sunday last week Douglas Carswell, Ukip’s first elected MP, said: ‘Dislike of foreigners is not merely offensive, but absurd.’

He said the party must be ‘inclusive’ and have no truck with candidates who insult people’s ‘heritage or background’. 

UKIP has been stung by a series of race rows.

Last week the UKIP leadership  moved to distance the party from remarks made by one of its councillors who claimed an 'overload' of immigrants had turned Britain into a racist country.

Trevor Shonk, who represents Ukip on Kent County Council and Ramsgate Town Council, blamed Labour and the Conservatives for allowing in more immigrants than the country could cope with.

But Ukip deputy chairman Suzanne Evans later rejected the suggestion, saying that Mr Shonk didn't express himself 'as well as he could'.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Mr Shonk said: 'When I've done leaflets every shopkeeper, whether they are Asian or English born, they're concerned about the influx.

'It hasn't been staggered, it's just overload. We haven't got the care homes, we haven't got the houses for our own.' 

Earlier this month Kerry Smith quit as Ukip's candidate in a top target seat after being forced to apologise for a series of offensive comments.

In recordings of phone calls obtained by the Mail on Sunday, the would-be MP was said to have mocked gay party members as 'poofters', joked about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referred to someone as a 'Chinky bird'.

Mr Farage said he felt sorry for ‘rough diamond’ Mr Smith.

The Ukip leader also blamed immigration for causing traffic jams on the M4.
