The sight of Luis Suarez shimmying off to the promised land of La Liga while Alexis Sanchez shuffled into Arsenal is yet another sign the sun is setting on the heyday of the Premier League.

Much like the sun-starved hordes who stream from our shores to the Costa del Sol each summer,  the true greats of football are heading to one destination. And it’s not dreary old Blighty.

Sure, the 'greatest league in the world' will still be a draw for some. But it is not too much of a stretch to say England is now merely a home for Spain’s cast-offs.

New boy: Luis Suarez swapped Merseyside for Barcelona this summer in a £75m move

Signing: The PFA and FWA Player of the Year chose to make his move to Spain after consistent speculation

In the beginning, there was David Beckham. Spain had not even had their hands on a European Championship when the England midfielder packed his bags at Old Trafford in 2003 and accepted the untold riches offered by Real Madrid.

He was closely followed by Michael Owen a year later. Both were undoubted stars for the two English clubs with the biggest world-wide appeal, yet both were cashing in on wealth and opportunity abroad.

Perhaps, though, it was Cristiano Ronaldo’s switch from Old Trafford to the Bernabeu in 2009 which was the clearest indicator that the Premier League was no longer the go-to place for the game’s greatest talents.

Ronaldo had undoubtedly latched on to a football nation on the up when he switched to Spain just a year before their first World Cup triumph.

Premier League: Diego Costa moved to Chelsea and Ander Herrera to Manchester United

But reasons for his move must go deeper than that. Manchester United were still one of the game’s super-powers under the leadership of Sir Alex Ferguson; there was every reason for one of the world’s greatest players to stay at one of the planet's premier clubs.

Real Madrid, despite their standing on the world stage, have a stark record of underachievement in the last five years, with just one league title. Added to that, they have won only three European Cups since the 1960s.

Ronaldo is not alone, there is now a talent drain to Spain. Despite Real’s lack of recent achievement, Gareth Bale, one of Britain’s finest players of a generation, still saw fit to move to Madrid from Tottenham last year.

Wanted: Manchester United were interested in Toni Kroos but the World Cup winner chose Real Madrid

The Premier League’s best reply was for Arsenal to gamble Mesut Ozil.

This summer, Spain gets Suarez, we get Sanchez; Manchester United wanted Toni Kroos, he went to Madrid; Spain gets Colombia’s World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez, and we can’t top that.

The money on offer from Spain’s leading clubs is undoubtedly one of the biggest lures for players on the transfer merry-go-round.

But even if the Premier League’s leading clubs stump up sufficient cash to tempt Messi, Ronaldo, Rodriguez et al, there are inescapable realities which will always give Espana the edge.

Red-letter day: Michael Owen also made the move to Madrid, from Liverpool

The attraction of climate and lifestyle should never be underestimated by British clubs attempting to land the leading players.

But there is a harsher, more blunt 
reality. The 
physicality of the Premier League, one of the reasons it stands proud, 
is also one of its biggest drawbacks.

Chelsea and 
Manchester City may believe they can buck the trend, but money doesn't 
buy you everything. When it comes to the true legends of the game, the 
pockets of the Premier League’s top clubs will never be deep enough to 
overcome the other obstacles.

And Spain will continue to reign.
