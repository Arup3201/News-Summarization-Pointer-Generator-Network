The veil-wearing former wife of terrorist Mohammed Merah says the couple played violent video games including Call of Duty together before he gunned down seven people in cold blood.

Hizia Miriam, 18, has thrown a new light on the self-styled Jihad, or Islamic warrior during her interview with French police.

Rather than a deeply religious extremist fighting ‘enemies’ in the west Merah comes across as a delinquent who was psychologically disturbed by his favourite hobby.

It follows calls by British MPs for 
restrictions on violent video games after the Norwegian mass killer 
Anders Breivik claimed he ‘trained’ on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

Merah,
23, caused terror across south west France in March when he shot dead 
three soldiers and four civilians, including a Rabbi and three children,
at a Jewish school in Toulouse.

He
produced a video of the slaughter which was later edited to Islamic 
martial music before being shot dead himself by police following a 
siege.

But Miriam, who was married to Merah for 17 days before his death, said: ‘We had many religious conversations, but we spent our time playing PlayStation, including Call of Duty and Need for Speed.’

Call of Duty, a so-called ‘shooter’ video game, depicts a battlefield in which heavily armed troops fight it out to the death.

It has often been criticised for glorifying violence, and for encouraging vulnerable young people towards anti-social behaviour.

But Miriam, who became Merah’s bride as a young teenager infront of an Imam, said he was a ‘kind and gentle husband’, adding: ‘We also watched The Simpsons together. We talked a lot and he needed someone to listen.

'He needed love and I compared him to a baby.’

Miriam, the daughter of a security guard from Toulouse, married Merah on December 15 2011, but their divorce was finalised two days before his death.

She said they had ‘decided to get married with the consent of both families’ but their union had failed because they were both too young.

Concerned: In an Early Day Motion sponsored by MP Keith Vaz he said the 
government should provide for closer scrutiny of aggressive 
first-person shooter video games

Miriam now lives with her parents 
close to Toulouse airport in Blagnac and only goes out wearing an 
Islamic veil, despite the fact that such garments have been banned in 
France.

She made her comments in police interviews which were today leaked to the political weekly Le Point.

Last
month the Labour backbencher Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs 
Select Committee, called for new powers to control the video games 
industry, and especially huge sellers like Call of Duty.

An Early Day Motion sponsored by Mr Vaz called said the government should ‘provide for closer scrutiny of aggressive first-person shooter video games’.

Breivik, who has admitted killing 77 people and is currently on trial for mass murder, used Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to ‘develop target acquisition’ using ‘holographic imaging’.

He said: ‘If you are familiar with a holographic sight, it's built up in such a way that you could have given it to your grandmother and she would have been a super marksman.’
