Michael Alig, the notorious king of New York’s Club Kids in the late 1980s who went to prison for murdering his drug dealer in 1996 has been freed on conditional release.

Alig, 48, whose life was portrayed by Macaulay Culkin in the 2003 movie Party Monster, was released from Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, NY on Monday after serving more than 17 years in prison.

He was sentenced to first-degree manslaughter in 1997 for the murder and dismemberment of drug dealer Andre ‘Angel’ Melendez a year earlier.

Alig and his accomplice, Robert ‘Freeze’ Riggs, had pleaded guilty to the crime and were sentenced to 10-20 years in prison. Riggs was released in 2010.

Originally from Indiana, Alig moved to New York in the early 1980s to attend Fordham University but later dropped out and became involved in the New York underground club scene as a promoter.

Even before his conviction, Alig and his fellow Club Kids had grabbed national attention for their outrageous Manhattan dance parties that showcased sex, rampant drug use and over-the-top costumes.

The story of Alig's rise and fall was first told in the 1999 book Disco Bloodbath written by his best friend and fellow Club Kid James St. James.

Party Monster, the 2003 fiction account of Alig's life starred Macaulay Culkin as infamous NYC club promoter Michael Alig, right, and Seth Green as his friend James St. James

The book detailed St. James’ friendship with Alig and how it fell apart as Alig's drug addiction worsened and ended after the death of Melendez.

It later became the basis for Party Monster, the 2003 fiction account of Alig’s life starring Culkin and Seth Green as St. James. Parole officers allegedly denied Alig parole in 2006 after watching the debauched movie.

A cult hit, the film has helped maintain interest in Alig and despite nearly two decades behind bars he has 11.7K followers on Twitter and according to his blog 'he has had many offers of work, and even more requests for interviews and shows.'

His social media accounts were maintained by a friend while Alig was inside, although he has tweeted several times since his release on Monday morning.

‘Just narrowly escaped being re-arrested for having my release filmed but we’re ok and in (sic) our way to nyc! #narrowescape,' he tweeted of his departure from prison.

'Happy to be free and so grateful for this second chance. Can’t wait 2C @JSJDarling at dinner. #frenemy.'

Another tweet said: 'W/all these cams following now I know what @KimKardashian feels like ! #keepingupwiththeclubkid.'
