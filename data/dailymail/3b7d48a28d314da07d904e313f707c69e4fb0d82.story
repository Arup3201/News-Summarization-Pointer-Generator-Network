A top student died from a brain tumour after being sent home four times by a GP who dismissed her severe headaches as migraines caused by exam stress.

Lucy Goulding, 16, told her mother ‘I can’t take it any more. I just want to die’ after being turned away by her doctor for the final time. Just hours later she collapsed and she died the following day in hospital, an inquest heard.

The teenager died without knowing her fellow students had voted for her to be crowned prom queen at a school event which was cancelled after her death.

Lucy Goulding, 16, died of an undiagnosed brain tumour after her GP sent her away four times saying she was suffering from migraines caused by stress

She also died without learning that she had gained eight A grades at GCSE which would have seen her placed in the top ten students at Chatsmore Catholic High School, in Worthing, West Sussex.

Her tearful mother Antonella Goulding, 44, recalled how Lucy was repeatedly sent home by Dr Jaspal Mahil in the weeks leading up to her death on June 27, this year, despite complaining of headaches, vomiting and dizziness.

The inquest heard how the doctor had told the bright schoolgirl that ‘there was not enough evidence of a tumour’ after her mother begged for an MRI scan just days before she died.

Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said that medical staff who came into contact with Lucy had failed to take her symptoms seriously.

She said that ‘everyone was closed to anything but the psychological cause of Lucy’s symptoms’ and that had the tumour been detected earlier it was ‘high unlikely’ that she would have died.

On May 28, Lucy had first seen Dr Mahil with headaches and she saw her again on June 11, June 24 and June 25.

Her mother asked Dr Mahil for an MRI scan on her fourth visit but was told ‘there was not enough evidence of a tumour’ to have one.

Dr Mahil told the inquest: ‘After looking at her history and examining her, my findings were that it was a migraine.

‘She had finished her exams and I also thought it might be related to caffeine withdrawal or dietary.’

She added: ‘Knowing what I know now it (the tumour) probably does all fit in.

‘I’m sorry to all of Lucy’s family.’

On June 26 Mrs Goulding described her condition as screaming with pain, very weak and complaining of headaches.

The mother of two added: ‘I couldn’t help her so I called paramedics.

An inquest heard that Lucy might not have died if she had been diagnosed and had surgery sooner

‘They asked if she had any dietary issues so I told her that she had bulimia a year before but she was fine now.

‘I asked them to watch her as her headaches weren’t normal.’

The teenager was taken to Worthing Hospital where the staff wanted to discharge her to the community mental health team.

But Mrs Goulding insisted that she was admitted for more tests on her headaches.

Later
 that evening Lucy had a seizure and was rushed by ambulance to 
Southampton General Hospital in Hampshire which specialises in 
neurosurgery.

Dr Jaspal Mahil told the inquest into Lucy's death that she believed the teenager was suffering from migraines

Mrs Goulding said: ‘The staff seemed to see her in pain but didn’t react. They weren’t seeing her.

‘She lay on my shoulder and said: “I can’t take it any more. I just want to die”.

‘I said “no you don’t, once they find out what’s wrong with you, you will be fine”.

‘I was holding her hand as the doctors and nurses arrived.’

‘They took her for a scan and then I was told she had a mass on her brain which was a possible tumour.’

Consultant on the ward Dr Mwape Kabole, admitted that there had been no neurological monitoring or observations, nor had Lucy been seen by a consultant, once she had been admitted to the paediatric ward.

Dr Abir Chakraborty, a consultant at the hospital told the inquest in Worthing, the ‘slow growing’ brain tumour was in the back of her brain and had grown to a ‘considerable’ size.

He said: ‘We took the tumour out completely but the swelling was so big we couldn’t put the bone or skin back.

‘When she slipped into coma that is when she effectively died.

‘If she came across earlier to have surgery the outcome may have been different.’

Recording a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Karen Henderson said: ‘What strikes me about the evidence today is that no one believed Lucy or Mrs Goulding at any time from her admission to the point of her death.

‘Everyone was closed to anything but the psychological cause of Lucy’s symptoms.’

After the inquest, Mrs Goulding said that she wanted the tragedy to change the way the NHS cared for children.

Recording a narrative verdict at the inquest at Worthing's Centenary House, assistant coroner Karen Henderson said: 'What strikes me about the evidence is that no one believed Lucy or Mrs Goulding at any time'

She said: 'It is a sad disgrace that with the education and the tools available today, Lucy's symptoms were not recognised which resulted in Lucy's death.

'I have trusted both the GP and the health professionals at the hospital and I have let my Lucy die.

'I can't undo my error. Nothing and nobody can give Lucy her precious life back.

'You can't undo your errors, but you can and must ensure that the same doesn't happen again costing another special young life.'

In a statement from Western Sussex Hospitals Trust, Dr Tim Taylor, Consultant Paediatrician and Chief of Service for Women and Children, said: 'We deeply regret what happened to Lucy and the failings in her care and offer our sincere apologies to her family.'

'We have carried out a full investigation, which has been externally scrutinised and made changes as a result.'

He said all paediatric patients are now see by a consultant at the beginning of the day followed by two reviews in the evening and night.’
