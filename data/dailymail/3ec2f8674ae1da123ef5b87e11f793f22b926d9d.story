New York marathon organizers have blamed the media for the negative publicity that led to the race being cancelled in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.

A letter from the New York Road Runners was sent to 47,000 runners on Saturday and said that 'the extensive and growing media coverage antagonistic to the marathon and its participants' had made holding the 26.2-mile race unsafe.

A last-minute decision was made on Friday afternoon to cancel the marathon after it was decided it would be divisive to hold the event through the five boroughs.

Many runners understood the decision, especially with the death toll from the storm at 107, including 41 in New York City.

The destruction and power outages made 
many New Yorkers recoil at the idea of police protecting a foot race and
evicting storm victims from hotels to make way for runners. More than half of the 40,000 runners were from out of town.

Gym instructor Frank Salzone, 28, had planned to run the marathon but instead returned to his native Staten Island to coordinate help for those affected.

Along with 15 others, Mr Salzone was spending Sunday clearing debris in New Dorp Beach, one of the hardest hit areas.

He told MailOnline: 'Those living a few blocks away from my family have been affected and it wasn't until I came out to Staten Island on Thursday that I realized how bad it was.

'I realized that running for four-and-a-half hours was not the best thing when I could be helping and so I decided not to run.

'A lot of people came from out of town for the marathon and I understand it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so if they want to run the loop without taking away resources, then fine.

'But if you're from the city, you can run anytime and should be out helping your fellow New Yorkers.'

Here to help: Many marathon runners turned out to help New Yorkers who were hardest hit by clearing debris and bringing supplies

Called off: The marathon was cancelled due to public backlash that resources would be diverted from helping hurricane victims

Cancelled: Two runners, who traveled to New York to take part in the marathon, give a thumbs-down in front of the finish line in Central Park on Saturday after the decision to cancel the race

There was concern from sponsors about a public backlash against the race, according to the New York Post, which began in 1970 with just 127 runners.

There
was disappointment among runners who had spent months preparing for the
grueling race which brings in millions of dollars for charities through
fundraising.

Some 
‘disenfranchised’ marathoners vowed to run the route anyway. David 
McNally, who has lived most of his life in Staten Island, organized an 
unofficial shadow marathon.

After some consideration, the group decided to do the original 1970 course route of roughly four laps around Central Park.

McNally’s project was met with some criticism from people who felt the marathon was insulting to people who’s homes have been destroyed or lost loved ones.

‘Instead of running past neighborhoods where people’s homes once stood in a display of defiance, how about you volunteer and make your trip to NYC worth something bigger than your pride,’ William F Hattar wrote on the Facebook group’s wall.

There was anger from some runners with people taking photographs beneath the Marathon banners in Central Park making rude gestures and giving it the thumbs down.

Runners insisted the mock-marathon will be a display of New York’s resilience.

‘If it were a baseball game, no one would challenge the idea of letting the show go on,’ Renia Ellen Saddler wrote on the page.

‘This isn’t about ego; this is a reminder that humans are strong and brilliant, and we will not go gentle into that good night.'

However the majority of participants agreed with the decision to cancel the race. Hundreds of people were making their way to devastated communities up and down the East Coast to volunteer.

Runners carrying backpacks filled with things like baby wipes and energy bars went to those in need in Staten Island.

Many runners wore the vests they would have had on had they taken part in the race. 

'We initially were bummed, but also saddened by the perception that runners were indifferent to the needs of other people,' Jordan Metzl, a sports medicine doctor in New York, told the Associated Press. 'We wanted to turn a negative to a positive.'

Stranded residents have been relying on volunteers delivering food, water, warm clothes and other basic necessities.

Almost one week after the superstorm struck the East Coast, power was still out to some 2.5 million customers, the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery & Energy Reliability reported.

The state with the largest number of outages by far is still New Jersey with 32 per cent of customers without power.

Power was restored to much of lower Manhattan early on Friday evening but nine per cent of customers across the state of New York still do not have power, followed by seven per cent in Connecticut.
