The British banker - identified as 29-year-old Rurik Jutting - has been charged with the double murder of two prostitutes in Hong Kong.

Mr Jutting, who attended Cambridge University, was arrested by police after the bodies of two women were discovered in his up-market apartment in the early hours of yesterday morning.

One of the victims, whose naked body was reportedly found tied up in a suitcase on the 31st-floor balcony, has been identified as 25-year-old Sumarti Ningsih from Indonesia, according to reports.

The other woman, believed to be aged between 25 and 30, is thought to have worked part-time as a DJ at a local bar, a source told the South China Morning Post. She had suffered a series of knife wounds.

Both women were found after Mr Jutting, who is understood to have recently left his job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, allegedly called police to his address in Wan Chai - an area that is popular with young and affluent expatriate executives and bankers.

It is thought the woman found inside the apartment was attacked shortly before officers arrived. 

Ms Ningsih, who is believed to have been killed several days before she was found, was identified on Sunday by her cousin, who works as a domestic worker in Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post reports.

It claimed that she had been arrested on suspicion of breaching her conditions of stay in the territory.

Sex toys and cocaine were also reportedly found at the scene, along with a knife that was seized by officers.

Mr Jutting's phone is today being examined by police in a bid to identify possible further victims, according to local reports.

It is understood that photos of Ms Ningsih, apparently taken after she died, were among roughly 2,000 that officers found on the device.

He will appear in court in Hong Kong today while police are said to have placed a 'holding charge' on him.

A statement from Hong Kong police said: 'Police today laid a holding charge against a 29-year-old man with two counts of murder.

'Police arrested the man on November 1 in suspected connection with a murder case in which a foreign woman aged between 25 and 30, and another woman were killed.

'The arrestee will appear before Eastern Magistrates' Courts today.' 

Mr Jutting, who attended Winchester College, an independent boys school in Hampshire, grew up in Chertsey, Surrey, where his family lived in a Grade II listed home.

One neighbour, who remembered Mr Jutting and his brother Auryn as teenagers, said he had been shocked by the news of his arrest.

He described the family as 'nice enough' and said they were 'quiet and kept themselves to themselves'.

When Mr Jutting left to continue his studies at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he studied law and history, his parents, Helen and Graham, moved into a Grade II listed manor in nearby Cobham.

The Victorian home, which was built in 1861, is set behind wrought iron gates and was the inspiration for Ernest Shepard's illustration of Kenneth Grahame's children's classic The Wind in the Willows.  

Rurik Jutting appears to have worked in Structured Capital Markets at Barclays in London between 2008 and 2010, when he took a job with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 

He was moved to the bank's Hong Kong office, where he worked as a trader in the Structured Equity Finance & Trading department, in July last year.

A porter at the smart Wapping apartment where he lived before moving to China described him as unfriendly and uncommunicative.

'He was a single guy, he was just one of those that kept his head down,' he said.

'He didn't say 'hi' or anything like that. He was a bit of a loner.

'He did used to have a girlfriend - they lived together for a while then they broke up and she moved out.

'They seemed happy together, holding hands, smiling and laughing.

'He seemed quite normal, I can't believe it. He wasn't aggressive, he was a really quiet and calm guy.'

One colleague told the Telegraph that he had apparently vanished from his workplace a week ago. It has also been reported that he resigned from his post days before news of the murders emerged. 

A spokesman for Bank of America Merrill Lynch confirmed that it had previously employed a man by the same name but would not give more details nor clarify when the person had left the bank. 

CCTV footage from his apartment block, a 40-storey development of exclusive properties, showed the banker and the other victim returning to the 31st floor shortly after midnight local time yesterday.

He allegedly called police to his home at 3.42am, shortly after the woman he was seen with is believed to have been killed.

She was found with two wounds to her neck and her throat had been slashed. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Ms Ningsih's body, which was wrapped in a carpet and stuffed inside a black suitcase that measured about three feet by 18 inches, was not found by police until eight hours later.

A police source quoted by the South China Morning Post said: 'She was nearly decapitated and her hands and legs were bound with ropes. 

'She was naked and wrapped in a towel before being stuffed into the suitcase. Her passport was found at the scene.'  

Wan Chai, the district where the apartment is located, is known for its bustling nightclub scene of 'girly bars,' popular with expatriate men and staffed by sex workers from South East Asia. 

Police have today been contacting nearby bars in an attempt to find out more about the background of the two murdered women. 

One resident in the 40-storey block, where most of the residents are expatriates, said he had noticed an unusual smell in recent days.

He told the South China Morning Post that there had been 'a stink in the building like a dead animal'.

Flats measuring just 350 square feet in the 30-storey development sell for more than £550,000 and can be rented for around £1,700 a month. 

A police source said that the scene of the latest murder was among the grisliest the city had seen since the so-called 'milkshake murder' which took place in 2003. 

In that case, American Nancy Kisel murdered her husband Robert, a Merrill Lynch investment banker, in their luxury home, bludgeoning him to death after giving him a drug-laced milkshake. She was jailed for life.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said last night: 'We can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Hong Kong.

'We are in touch with the local police and stand ready to provide consular assistance.'

The 40-storey J Residence is reportedly a high-end development favoured by junior expatriate bankers

Police said that when they arrived at the scene a woman was found unconscious and lying inside the flat 

Post-mortem examinations will be conducted later to ascertain the causes of death of the deceased
