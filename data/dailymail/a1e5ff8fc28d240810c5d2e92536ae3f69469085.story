Google is facing a legal battle from iPhone users in the UK who claim their online browsing habits were secretly tracked by the internet giant.

The landmark case could pave the way for up to 10 million Britons to sue Google for alleged privacy breaches.

A group of 12 people, all of whom use Apple devices, including the popular iPhone, are seeking damages in a case thought to be the first of its kind in the UK.

Industry giant: Google is accused of secretly installing cookies on devices and computers using Safari

They say that cookies, small tracking files, 
were installed by Google on the Apple computers and mobile devices of 
those using the Safari internet browser without their knowledge.

Cookies are used by advertisers, and owners of other websites, to target advertising based on an individual's internet use.

A High Court judge last year compared Google to a graffiti strewn wall, when ruling that the company cannot be held responsible for libellous or offensive content.

It followed a long running defamation suit by a former Conservative 
Party hopeful, Payam Tamiz, in reaction to piece on Google's Blogger.com platform labelling him a drug dealer and a thief.

But Google was less successful at the High Court when its Motorola patents covering technology to synchronise messages across several devices was rule invalid.

If the patent had been upheld, the Live Messenger instant messaging and email services of fellow industry heavyweight Microsoft would have been in violation.

It has also faced anger after it was revealed that it only paid £6 million in tax in the UK last year despite making £2.5 billion.

One example given by law firm Olswang
- which is bringing the case - is that a person carrying out an 
internet search for an engagement ring could find that their partner, 
when using the same device, later encounters adverts for rings when 
browsing online.

Claimants thought that cookies would 
be blocked because of assurances given by Google in the time their 
devices were allegedly affected, from summer 2011 to spring 2012, and 
also because of Safari's default settings.

Dan Tench, a partner at Olswang, 
said: 'Google has a responsibility to consumers and should be 
accountable for the trust placed in them.

'We hope that they will take this 
opportunity to give Safari users a proper explanation about what 
happened, to apologise and, where appropriate, compensate the victims of
their intrusion.'

Judith Vidal-Hall, former editor of 
magazine Index on Censorship, has issued proceedings against Google 
after claiming they had covertly tracked her use of the internet.

The 74-year-old said: 'Google claims 
it does not collect personal data but doesn't say who decides what 
information is 'personal'.

'Whether something is private or not should be up to the internet surfer, not Google. We are best placed to decide, not them."

A campaigning group, called Safari 
Users Against Google's Secret Tracking, has been set up on Facebook and 
Olswang believes it could prompt others to come forward to take action.

It is estimated there were 10 million users of Apple products in the UK at the relevant time.

Last year, Google was fined $22.5m dollars (£14.2m) in the US for using tracking cookies on Safari.
