There was only one realistic bidder - the BBC - for Premier League highlights but there could be a four-way fight for the live rights from 2016-17 when the mega offers are tabled next Friday.

There are encouraging signs for the Premier League that beIN Sport are seriously considering joining the Discovery Channel, BT Sport and Sky in a super heavyweight TV contest for the next three-year contracts.

BT Sport and Sky are certain bidders, while Discovery, who own Eurosport, are making the right noises since Sports Agenda revealed their interest in the rights a fortnight ago. Now it has emerged that beIN have been using London sports rights specialist Mark Oliver as a consultant on the PL possibilities.

The BBC will keep Premier League highlights on its Match of the Day programme after ITV failed to bid

Although that is not a firm indication that the Qatar-based station will bid, it does suggest they are thinking about it. Having the world’s richest TV network involved would take the price of the 168 matches bundled in seven packages — already mooted to fetch £10million a game — further into the stratosphere.

If beIN bid, it is likely to be on their own rather than in partnership with BT Sport. That combination seemed possible when beIN let their pundit Andy Gray work as a co-commentator on BT FA Cup matches last season, an experiment that has not been repeated this campaign.

The fact ITV did not come to the table for Premier League highlights makes it all the more odd that they chose to sack lead football presenter Adrian Chiles with immediate effect last week and replace him with Premier League-friendly Mark Pougatch. The timing suggested a link with the highlights, yet ITV say Pougatch’s appointment was unconnected.

Meanwhile, the BBC’s retention of Match of the Day is not expected to stop Gary Lineker hosting BT Sport’s Champions League coverage next season, although an exclusivity clause in Lineker’s BBC contract related to the British market will have to be renegotiated.

No wonder Chelsea have been struggling to find a new shirt sponsor prepared to pay the sky-high price owner Roman Abramovich believes that his team command. The classless club reacted to the FA charging Diego Costa for his blatant stamping offences by not holding a press conference before Saturday's pivotal Premier League game against Manchester City. Pathetic. The decision was supported by chairman Bruce Buck and the club board as well as communications chief Steve Atkins.

Keeping the Premier League highlights in their traditional 10.30pm slot on the BBC is good news for the Football League, who have an agreement with Channel 5 for a 9pm start for their highlights next season. Had ITV won the rights, there was a fear their highlights might have been scheduled to clash with C5.

Swimming in hot water

Sport England could have celebrated the success of football and cricket - both national sports - highlighted by their Active People Survey but instead chose to hammer swimming’s falling participation levels in their press release.

Overall annual sports participation numbers are down from 15.7million to 15.6m in the year ending October 2014, for which Sport England chief executive Jennie Price blamed swimming, whose numbers dropped by 245,000. The poor figures meant Sport England’s promises to return swimming to multi-year funding after improved governance had to be put on hold.

Sport England trust their Active People Survey data implicitly, although that confidence is not shared by every sport. British Gas, who sponsor swimming, found participation in decline but not nearly as drastically as the APS suggests. The survey also had cricket up when their own research showed a seven per cent fall.

Crowdfunding certainly hasn’t worked for the Paddy Power-backed FIFA presidential candidate David Ginola, whose stunt campaign folded on Thursday night with the failure to find one nomination - let alone five. However, Wasps fan Edward Marno has used the online money-raising method to gather the £800 needed for a billboard poster in Leicester in response to the Tigers’ advert outside Wasps’ new home at the Ricoh Arena.
