A photographer has released dramatic new pictures that show one of the thousands of migrants who attempt to cross illegally into the United States through Texas, and members of the U.S. Border Patrol as they attempt to stop them.

Photojournalist John Moore captured this undocumented immigrant in Falfurrias, Texas on Sept. 9, as he attempted to flee from agents through some of the heavy underbrush at the border.

Ultimately, the agents were able to catch up with the man, holding him at gunpoint to get him to surrender.

Since Oct. 1 of last year, the United States has detained more than 66,000 unaccompanied child immigrants, mostly from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. 

More than 66,000 additional immigrants traveling as families, mostly mothers and young children from Central America, have also been caught. 

Just yesterday, the attorney generals from the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras agreed to form a high-level group to address the migration of unaccompanied children.

Not happy: Texas Gov. Rick Perry has been vocal about how upset he is with the job Pres. Obama is doing to protect the border

Texas Governor Rick Perry has blamed the Obama administration for not keeping the Texas border secure, and in late August started Operation Strong Safety, which is aimed at preventing criminal activity by Mexican drug cartels on the Texas side of the border. 

Gov. Perry deployed 400 members of the National Guard who are not empowered to apprehend anyone, but rather will help identify potential criminal activity and alert law enforcement officers.

The number of guardsmen is expected to increase to 1000 in the coming weeks according to the Washington Post.
