A wife who reported her husband missing after he failed to come home found out he had been fatally struck by a car when she read it online five days later.

Jan VanBlarcom, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, sobbed as she recalled how she had no idea what had happened to her husband, 61-year-old Jay, when he failed to return home on October 4.

Authorities had failed to notify her that he had been struck by a vehicle while crossing the street as he headed to nearby Cottonwood Mall to replace his broken phone.

Heartbroken: Jan VanBlarcom breaks down in tears as she recounts how she was not notified of her husband's death by police - and instead found out after reading an online news article 5 days later

She frantically phoned his friends and family and went out looking for him, with no success. She waited for 48 hours to pass before she could file a missing persons report, she said.

But even after she filed the report with police, they failed to make the connection, she told KOAT.

Three more days passed until she received a call from her daughter saying she had seen an article online about Jay's death, in which it explained that he was hit by a car.

'I can't tell you what they said to me, all I know is I started screaming,' she said.

At a loss: When she filed a missing person's report after 2 days, police failed to make the connection

Mrs VanBlarcom said she has no idea how the unforgivable mix-up happened, but that her husband was carrying a list of contact numbers on him when he was hit, including her number.

'I want to know why you could run somebody's name in the media and not bother to tell me,' she told KOAT. 'They've all passed the buck.'

Police said that Jay, whose full name is James, was carrying a driving license from out of state, which could have complicated the matter.

Mrs VanBlarcom said she is now at a loss over what to do; her husband did not have life insurance and she needed to take out loans to cover the costs of his funeral.

Crash scene: He was hit by a car on a crosswalk close to their apartment as he walked to a nearby mall

But more than anything, she is struggling to cope with the loss of her husband.

'I didn't get to say goodbye,' she said through tears. 'I didn't get to do anything, I said goodbye to him, but it wouldn't have been my last goodbye, I would have hugged him, I would have kissed him, done something different.'

Police said the Office of Medical Investigators is responsible for making death notifications after the body has been retrieved, but the office did not respond to requests for comment.

The car accident is being listed by authorities as pedestrian error.
