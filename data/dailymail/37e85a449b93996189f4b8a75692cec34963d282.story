Gregg Warrillow inadvertently exposed himself to a dog walker on a road in Birmingham while trying to send a picture of his privates to his girlfriend

A man has claimed he inadvertently exposed himself to a dog walker while he was trying to send a picture of his private parts to his girlfriend.

Gregg Warrillow, 33, was parked up in his van on a main road in Birmingham when the female dog walker approached his vehicle from behind while he was trying to take the picture.

It landed Warrillow, from Solihull, in court, where he pleaded guilty to one charge of committing an act of outraging public decency.

He was given a 24-month community order and ordered to pay £300 court costs.

Denis Desmond, defending, said Warrillow 
was responding to his girlfriend.

He said: 'He did not intend anyone to 
see what he was doing, let alone cause harm or harassment.'

Judge
Simon Drew QC told Warrillow: 'It was thoughtless, foolish and immature.

'I suspect that you will have had considerable time to reflect.'
