Mancunian Sarah-Jayne Baguley is unemployed, but that doesn’t stop her binge-drinking a staggering 43 units on nights out.

The 19-year-old admits to Closer magazine this week that she regularly drinks over 86 units of alcohol in one weekend.

According to drinkaware.co.uk that is the equivalent to 36 pints of lager or five bottles of white wine (and 2,775 calories).

19-year-old binge drinker Sarah-Jayne Baguley admits to using half her weekly Jobseeker's Allowance payment of £57 per week to fund her heavy drinking

The party girl is regularly kicked out of clubs, or finds herself covered in vomit or having yet another one night stand.

At the height of her drinking she was downing 55 units in one night, almost 20 times the recommended allowance.

She admits to using half her weekly Jobseeker's Allowance payment of £57 per week to fund her heavy drinking.

But the former care worker, who was made redundant three months ago, is unrepentant about how she spends her money.

She says: 'It's stressful looking for a job, I need to let my hair down.

'I'm looking for jobs but in the meantime I don't see why I should stop having fun.

'I don't drink too much - it's only at the weekend and all my mates do it.

'I've been thrown out of clubs and woken up with strangers but its fun.

'Drinking is what I live for. I don't see the point of going out for a couple of drinks. I want to get completely wasted.'
