A Connecticut man was charged with murder after police say he stabbed his one-year-old niece in the stomach while babysitting the little girl.

Authorities responded to Park Street in Bristol shortly before 7.30pm Monday and encountered a neighbor running toward them carrying a child with a deep gash to her stomach inflicted with a knife.

Officers performed CPR on the girl, who was then rushed to Bristol Hospital before being airlifted to the Connecticut Children’s Medical Center in Hartford. Despite the doctors’ efforts, the toddler was pronounced dead a short time later.

Police say the victim was one-year-old Zaniyah Calloway. An 11-year-old child also was in the home but wasn’t injured.

Speaking to NBC New York, neighbors described a chaotic scene outside the house where the stabbing took place, with screams coming from the residence and people running frantically and calling for help.  

As officers approached the crime scene in the 200 block of Park Street, they found the suspect, 36-year-old Arthur Hapgood, standing on the porch naked.

Hapgood, of Waterbury, was taken to Bristol Hospital to be treated for self-inflicted non-life-threatening injuries.

The victim’s uncle was later taken to the Bristol Police Department for processing. He is being held on $1.5million bail on charges including murder, reckless endangerment and risk of injury to a child.

The motive for the fatal slashing is not clear, according to investigators.

According to records obtained by the station WFSB, Hapgood has had run-ins with the law in the past in connection to felony drug charges, which have landed him in prison.
