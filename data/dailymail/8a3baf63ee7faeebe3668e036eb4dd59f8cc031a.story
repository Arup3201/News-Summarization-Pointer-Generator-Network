With her bouffant hair, perfectly applied make-up and wrinkle-free skin, it's almost impossible to believe that Joan Collins is 80.

Now, in an interview with the Express, she has revealed the secret of her eternally youthful appearance - make-up.

'Every woman should wear make-up,' insists the veteran actress. 'It takes years off. I’m wearing lots of false eyelashes today and to me lipstick is the best cosmetic that exists.'

No advice required: Joan says her goddaughter, model Cara Delevingne, needs no help to look good

But there's more to Collins' youthful look than artfully applied cosmetics, as the former Dynasty star readily admits.

Despite having ruled out surgery, the glamorous actress says she's kept her looks by keeping her weight steady and by taking really good care of her skin.

'I eat an avocado every day and have facials in New York with a girl called Tracie Martyn,' she adds. 'She works a lot of oxygen into my skin.'

But it's not just skincare and make-up that keep Collins young, her youthful approach to fashion helps as well.

And should she need advice in that department, her goddaughter, supermodel Cara Delevingne, is on hand to help.

Not that Collins would ever consider sending tips in the opposite direction. 'I saw Cara last night and she doesn’t need any advice,' reveals the actress.

'She is the most natural and down-to-earth girl you could ever meet. You would never believe she is a top model. I am very proud and I think it is wonderful what she has done.'

For the rest of us, Collins does have some style advice to offer, not least of which is avoiding jeans which she describes as 'the most unattractive garment ever invented'.

'You accentuate the positives and eliminate the negatives,' she continues, although she's not ashamed to admit that a gym-honed body helps.

'I say, "Use it or lose it". I have my own fitness regime, which is centred around stretching, free-weights and fast walking.

'I also have a trainer half of the year as I spend my summers in the south of France where I swim a lot.'

And with Collins looking as glamorous as ever as she heads towards her 81st birthday, it seems eating a daily portion of avocados, regular oxygen facials and St Tropez summers really are the secret of eternal youth.
