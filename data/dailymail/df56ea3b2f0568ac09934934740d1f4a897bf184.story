A young woman was reported missing in a notorious prostitute hotspot where 'psycho' trader Rurik Jutting spent seedy holidays, it emerged today.

The woman, who was in her 20s, vanished in the red-light district of Angeles City - dubbed the 'Sin City' of the Philippines, MailOnline can reveal.

Jutting is understood to have visited the vice capital several times over the last 18 months to hook up with groups of women, including a former girlfriend, for debauched breaks away.

Pictures that emerged after his arrest for the murder of two prostitutes in Hong Kong show the Cambridge graduate surrounded by girls at hotels and clubs in the city, where call girls cost a fraction of the rate in the former British colony. 

A tourism website boasts the district offers 'alcohol and sexy, young women' where 'recreational sex is the sport of choice'.

Despite anti-trafficking laws being passed two years ago, Angeles City's Fields Avenue continues to thrive, with its mile-long, gaudily lit bars full of young women and under-age girls roosting outside, beckoning to foreigners.

A website called www.balibago.com – named after the city's red light district – openly brags: 'It's all here: alcohol and sexy, young women. 

'There are over 100 bars full of attractive and readily available women eager to show you a good time. 

'Balibago is a non-stop, drunken revel seven days a week, everyday of the year. Recreational sex is the sport of choice. 

'You can enjoy full privileges with one or more attractive young females regardless of your age, weight, physical appearance, interpersonal skills, wealth or social class.' 

Jutting, however, seemed to prefer to party outside Fields Avenue. 

He chose to stay at Angeles Beach Hotel, more popularly known as ABC Hotel, which is a stone's throw from the airport known for budget flights to and from Hong Kong.

Lighted up like a Nevada hotel despite a brewing nationwide shortage o power, ABC is known for its 'suites' with beds wide enough for threesomes, jacuzzi and steam baths, and a pool with a beach where wild parties are staged.

Rurik Jutting stayed at the venue - known as The Party Hotel' - with former partner Ariane Guarin before the two parted ways in September.

It was not clear why they broke up. 

In recent Facebook postings, Miss Guarin had expressed no regrets for the break-up. 

She even showed herself happily partying somewhere in Angeles City on Halloween Night, around the time Jutting was said to have killed two women in his apartment in Hong Kong.

It was also not known whether Guarin was a sex worker – euphemistically called 'GROs' or guest relations officers – or simply a visitor who fell for a foreigner.  

In Angeles City, prostitution is 'hidden in plain sight', complained the Commission on Women which, together with Senator Cayetano, succeeded in having a law enacted to punish sex clients for the first time.

Although prostitution is illegal in the Philippines, a Philippine senator cited a study in 2008 that estimated some 800,000 sex workers, half of them underage, operated in the country.

Senator Pia Cayetano also quoted former American Ambassador Harry Thomas as saying that four out of every 10 foreign male visitors were sex tourists. 

The senator then pointed out that Angeles city was the place to go for sex. 

Reports of the woman's disappearance emerged after police in Hong Kong were understood to be widening their enquiries to the Philippines.

It is also believed Interpol and British police are  liaising with law enforcement officials in Hong Kong in an effort to piece together Jutting's movements.

Today, a police officer in Angeles City told MailOnline that an investigation had been launched after a worried mother reported her daughter missing.

But he said officers had not been able to establish whereabouts and the mother never returned.  

Romeo Amarillo, chief investigator for the district of Balibago, said: 'Last year, a mother came to the station to report that her daughter – around age 24 or 25 - was missing, but the mother never came back.'

Police have launched a crackdown on sex clubs and bars in the red-light district of Hong Kong where two prostitutes were found dead at Rurik Jutting's flat.

Dozens of officers raided premises at around midnight in Wan Chai demanding to see work permits and immigration documents from workers.

At the Neptune III Disco, they left after around ten minutes without making any arrests, the paper reported.

Asked if the operation was linked to the murders, one officer told The Telegraph: 'There is a little bit of a relationship.' 

It comes after the brutal killings of Indonesian women Sumarti Ningshi and Seneng Mujiasih, who are believed to have been working in the district on tourist visas.

Seneng Mujiasah, who adopted the name Jesse Lorena in Hong Kong, was visiting with a domestic worker's permit which had expired, officials said.

Sumarti Ningsih, meanwhile, had been in the former British colony on a tourist visa which ended on Monday.

It is believed they had both been operating as call girls in the district, which require special permits.

Earlier this week, a friend of one Jutting's alleged victims, Robert van den Bosch, said 'well informed sources' had told him that the murder suspect had regularly been to Angeles City. 

In one picture posted online, Jutting is seen in a strip bar called Rio Club, where tourists are known to pick up sex workers, with his arms draped around two women.

Behind them is a mirror scrawled in marker pen that appears to list the particulars of the bar's women.

Police are expected to look at the travel movements of Jutting throughout his two years working in the Far East. 

Manila, Bangkok and the former Portuguese colony of Macau are other popular destinations of sex-hungry expatriates.

Amarillo said he was not aware of Jutting's case.   

He added that it would take time for them to dig up the missing woman's name since they were not computerised and cases brought to them are recorded by hand on large journals that serve as police blotters.  

Another investigator, Marlon Mamucut told MailOnline that news of the double murder was briefly flashed this morning on local Channel 11.

'We are not aware that the accused has been coming to Angeles City,' Mamucut said.

He added that no one from 'higher headquarters' has ordered them to do any follow-up of Jutting's visits there.

It was also revealed today that officers investigating the murders  found grisly 'selfies' on Jutting's phone which show the accused killer posing with one of the dead bodies, it has been claimed. 

The gruesome photographs are said to show the British banker posing with the corpse of victim Sumarti Ningsih, whose decomposing body was found stuffed in a suitcase on Jutting's balcony.

The images are understood to be among 2,000 photographs and videos of the two women found on the former public schoolboy's mobile phone, many of which show him having sex with the women.

The news comes as it emerged Jutting's trading permit was revoked over suspicions he was a rogue trader on the day he is accused of killing the first of his alleged victims, raising questions that the collapse of his high-flying banking career may have triggered the killings.  

Details of the 2,000 photographs and video clips are said to have emerged from a police source, according to Hong Kong's Apple Daily newspaper.

As police widened their inquiry last night, it emerged Jutting's trading permit was revoked on the day he is said to have killed the first of his alleged victims.

His licence was cancelled by watchdog the Securities & Futures Commission in Hong Kong.

Investigators will want to know if the banker – described by the Wall Street Journal as a competitive poker player – was suspected of being a 'rogue trader' and if the loss of his permit triggered the bloodbath.

Earlier, in his first account since two prostitutes were found butchered in his luxury bachelor-pad, the Cambridge graduate insisted he had no mental health problems. 

Jutting was said to be 'frank and honest' with his legal team that the vice girls died in his flat – one was found chopped up in a suitcase – and blamed it simply on 'incidents involving him and girls' without elaborating.
