Two fearless climbers who scale cranes and scaffolding without safety equipment have been shot by a pellet gun while climbing onto a rooftop in Sussex.

Max Cave, 21 and Luke Harty, 19 were hit in the chest by airgun pellets by a man who saw them 'free running' across a building from a nearby window.

According to the Argus, Mr Cave has had surgery to remove a pellet from his chest, whereas Mr Harty's two wounds are safe to be left untreated.

A 47-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after the incident in Horsham, Sussex.

In an interview with The Argus, Mr Harty said: 'On Sunday we had just 
climbed up scaffolding and I was taking some photos of the view when I 
saw Max had just been shot in the abdomen.

'I was trying to climb down the scaffolding and as I was climbing down I was saying, "don’t shoot" – but he did.

'I had a shirt on and the pellet went through that and it was very painful.

Sunday's shooting comes just one month after East Sussex Fire and Rescue condemned the daredevils as 'irresponsible and reckless'.

The group has members aged between 14 and 24. In their latest stunt, they filmed themselves scaling a 100ft crane without any safety equipment and posted it on YouTube.

Director for prevention and protection Andy Reynolds said: 'It’s the height of stupidity.

'We
cannot afford to be attending potential call-outs to people like this 
when there are serious emergencies taking place across the county.

Before the incident, group member Sacha Powell, 18, insisted 
their stunts are safe as they undergo intense training and assess the 
safety of every situation.

A month before the incident, local fire fighters said their stunts were 'irresponsible and reckless'

'It might seem and look dangerous to 
other people. That doesn’t mean it’s dangerous for us. We’ve literally 
been living this stuff for years.

'We’ve practiced the techniques and movements required for the climbs a thousand times before taking it up at height.

'We know what surfaces and stuff to trust and it is important to know as we’re trusting our lives with it.

'We rarely take risks with challenges at height. If it were really as risky as the public perceive it, the death toll would be a great deal higher than it is.

'We try to limit little missions like this for night time to stay discreet and not to raise alert of the police, but sometimes it’s hard to resist getting some amazing pictures and videos of the sunset over the city skyline.

'We have no great fear of the consequences enforced by police.

'They are usually very nice and understanding, and usually a bit shocked, but we usually stay discreet because we don’t really want to have our fun at other people’s expense.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
