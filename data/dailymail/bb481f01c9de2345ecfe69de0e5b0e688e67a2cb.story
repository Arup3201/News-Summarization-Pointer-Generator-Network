Taylor Swift's controversial appointment as a tourism ambassador for New York City has been defended by legendary musician Billy Joel.

The 24-year-old singer faced a huge backlash after being installed as the Global Welcome Ambassador for New York in October  after it was revealed she has only been living in the city for little more than 12 months.

Critics dismissed her suitability for the role, questioning how much she knew about the city given that she was born in Pennsylvania and launched her career in Nashville.

But long-time New Yorker Billy Joel, who was born in The Bronx, grew up in Long Island and now owns a house in Centre Island near Manhattan, said that the city's residents should 'let her in'.

The 65-year-old said: 'I see the New York press going, "Taylor Swift is going to be the new New York representative?'' the singer told USA Today. 

'You snoots. Let her in. That's what New York is all about. I say, 'Welcome'.'

Joel also praised Swift's songwriting talents. 'She catches a lot of junk, maybe because she's so popular with young girls. But I like what she's projecting. I respect what she's doing.'

It was last month that Tayor Swift announced she had been appointed as an ambassador for the city during an episode of Good Morning America.

She said at the time: 'I'm still learning, but I'm so enthusiastic about this city that when I love something, I'm very vocal about it.

'New York was a huge landscape for what became this album. It's affected my life in ways I'm not even aware of fully.'

The singer, who recently bought a £12million apartment in the trendy Tribeca area, also penned a song called Welcome to New York, which provided the opening track to her new album, 1989.

She added: 'I started the album with Welcome to New York because New York has been an important landscape and location for the story of my life in the last couple of years.

'It's like an electric city, and I approached moving there with such wide-eyed optimism. I saw New York as a place of endless potential and possibilities, and you can hear that reflected in this music and in this song.'

As part of her role, the singer presented a series of videos for New York's official tourism agency, NYC Go, including one in which the singer explains some common slang words, such as 'stoop' (commonly known as a porch) and 'bodega', the 24-hour corner shops which sell 'almost anything'.

In another video, she assures visitors that in New York, 'people are very friendly and there's also a lot of heart here. And it's easy to get around. People will help you if you ask for help.'

But the move provoked a furious reaction from New Yorkers were shocked that she was selected to represent the city.

'I'm incensed! It's insulting,' said Twisted Sister singer Dee Snider, who was born in Queens.

He told the New York Daily News: 'She doesn't have any life experience here, or connection to the town.

'There's so many others — Jerry Seinfeld, for instance, if you want a big name,' Snider added.

'But Taylor Swift is the pop culture queen, so she moves into town, and she's the ambassador.'

The NYC Go Facebook page was flooded with negative responses.

'Taylor Swift has nothing to do with NYC, she is a bad representation. Get a real NY'er instead,' commented Ilana Vickers.

'Seems like a truly ridiculous ambassador,' wrote another poster, Kiersten Kehrer.

But NYC Go stood by their decision, saying: 'We couldn't have asked for a better synergy between Taylor and NYC & Company to tell our story about what makes New York City, New York City.'

'This is a campaign targeting visitors to New York City rather than locals,' they told MailOnline Travel.

'There's a separate campaign encouraging locals to explore their own city that celebrates the views of locals.'

'What makes New York City New York City is that it is unlike anywhere else in the world.

'It's almost like this city has its own heartbeat. You can find fashion that inspires you, art that inspires you, humanity that inspires you. 

'Everywhere you look. It's impossible not to fall in love or be affected by something in New York City.

'I think what brought me to New York is still a little bit of a mystery to me. 

'Every day I would wake up with this feeling, like I need to be in New York. It pulled me here like a magnet. 

'I was intimidated by the fact that it was bright and bold and loud, and now I know that I should run towards things like that. 

'I should run towards things that are absolutely overwhelmingly electric. 

'There's so much happening right in front of me, so many stories playing out that for my writing it definitely helped inspire an album that is by far the most proud of in my career.'

The head of New York tourism also waded into the row, saying the pop star was a suitable choice given that it is a 'city of immigrants'.

Fred Dixon, President and CEO of NYC & Company, the official marketing and tourism organisation for the City of New York, said that Swift was chosen because of her newcomer status, not in spite of it.

'New York is a city of immigrants, not many of us were born in New York – we've all followed our dreams there.'

Dixon revealed that Taylor's new role came about after he met her manager by chance, which led to an invitation to the singer's recently-purchased apartment, where he first listened to her song dedicated to New York.

'Taylor's song Welcome To New York is written from the perspective of a newcomer, that starry-eyed optimism and overwhelming energy you feel when you first come to New York, and she wanted to share that,' Dixon added.

'It's like we wrote it for our own brand,' he said, adding that Swift's reach on social media and her 'authentic' engagement with her huge following is something that money can't buy.
