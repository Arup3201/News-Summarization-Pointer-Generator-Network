A motorist who copied a set of number plates before deliberately speeding past a mobile speed camera has been described as Australia's 'dumbest driver' after they released a picture of him behind the wheel. 

New South Wales police are looking for the driver of the blue Mitsubishi after he was clocked at 130km/h - 30 kilometres and hour over the limit - at Heathcote, in southern Sydney. 

To incriminate himself more, he posted dash-cam footage of his 'feat' on Facebook, calling the post  'Trolling a speed camera'.
