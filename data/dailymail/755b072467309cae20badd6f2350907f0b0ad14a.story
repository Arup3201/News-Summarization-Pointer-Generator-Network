She should be in the prime of her career, posing for magazine shoots instead of prison mugshots.

But Lindsay Lohan has been subject to her FIFTH mugshot in just four years at the tender age of 25.

Today, a tearful Lohan was led away from court in handcuffs and taken into custody after a judge blasted her for violating probation.

Booked: This photo was taken after Lindsay Lohan was taken into custody, making it the FIFTH mugshot of her life

The troubled actress previously had the embarrassing photographs taken on July 24 and November 15 of 2007 and later again on July 20 and September 24 of 2010.

The first mugshot was taken three weeks before filming was scheduled to resume on Poor Things, when Lohan was arrested for a second DUI and ordered to return to rehab.

The second was when she served a grand total of 84 minutes behind bars following her DUI.

Her third photograph came after she violated the terms of her probation and was sentenced to 90 days in jail - she served just 14 .

The fourth came after her probation was revoked following a failed drug test, just before attending the Betty Ford Center for three months until early January 2011.

Welling up: Lindsay Lohan appeared in a Los Angeles courtroom today where a judge revoked her probation and ordered her into custody

Lohan has had her latest probation
revoked pending a November 2 hearing after Judge Stephanie Sautner 
slammed her for failing to complete time at the Downtown Women's Centre.

The
Mean Girls star is now understood to have been released after posting 
$100,000 and will not spend time behind bars - for now, at least.

The outcome is pending the November 
hearing, which was scheduled by the judge today, where the court will 
hear further testimonies before deciding on the course of action.

Becoming a habit: Lindsay Lohan is getting quite acquainted with the orange jumpsuit as she posed for police mugshots on September 24 and July 20 last year

Still pouting: Despite the severity of the situation, the actress managed to look photogenic during her mugshots on November 15 and July 24 2007

Lindsay was formally arrested in court today and taken into custody after Sautner revoked her probation.

On her booking sheet, the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department accidentally listed her sex as male, and 
detailed how she weighed 116lbs.

Sautner said Linsday should serve 16 
hours at the morgue on clean-up duty between now and her next court 
hearing in an attempt to mitigate the current situation.

Cuffed: Lohan was led away in handcuffs and taken into custody after the hearing. It is likely she will post bail and be released by the end of the day

The actress had been sentenced to 480 hours community service earlier this 
year as part of her punishment for stealing a gold necklace from a jewellery
store.

During the hearing, Sautner asserted Lohan had managed to wilfully get herself kicked off the programme by cancelling 
on the women's centre nine times.

Faces of pain: Lindsay was her usually-animated self during today's hearing

Making an impression: Lohan arrived to court in an eggshell blue dress and gold peep-toe heels, teamed with a Chanel handbag, but was sporting rather heavy-handed make-up

Lohan welled up as her lawyer Shawn Holley Chapman fought her corner, pointing to the 'glowing report' by the Probation Service.

But despite Lohan completing some 
volunteer work this week at the Red Cross, the judge ruled it as void 
because it was not part of the sentence she had specifically stipulated at an earlier
hearing.

She says Lohan should have gone to the
morgue for clean-up duty to complete some of the hours of community 
service instead - which was the second part of the probation Sautner had
originally stipulated.

'Nobody has the power to change my sentence,' said an incredulous Sautner.

Frenzy:
The actress was greeted by an army of photographers as she arrived at 
the Los Angeles Superior Court West District Airport Courthouse

Fighting her corner: She was represented by her lawyer Shawn Holley Chapman

Packing punch after punch, an unimpressed Sautner told Lindsay: 'Probation is a gift as I see it. There is something called looking a gift horse in the mouth.'

Sautner was also perplexed as to why the Probation Service had given Lohan such a positive report.

She said her work this week at the 
Red Cross would not count towards the 60 days of community service Lohan
has been ordered to complete.

Sautner also estimated that Lindsay 
has only managed to fulfil three days out of the 60 so far, also 
taking into account the time taken to complete a shoplifters course.

She noted that Lindsay had been a 
no-show at the women's centre nine times and had only managed to do 
around a day-and-a-half there.

In the spotligh: Teams of paparazzi and TV camera crews were on hand to capture the actress's arrival and departure

Back home: Lindsay returns to her Venice Beach home in California after a dramatic day

Sautner suggested it was Lohan's 
inability to keep to schedule and disruption of the programme that 
eventually left women's centre with no option but to cancel her role there.

The star pulled up to the courthouse at 9.55am for the 10am hearing at the Airport Branch Courthouse.

Dressed in an eggshell blue dress and white scarf, the actress was also sporting rather heavy handed make-up.

She had her hair tied back in a ponytail and stepped out of her black Cadillac Escalade to a barrage of flashbulbs.

The Mean Girls actress has also served 35 days under house arrest this year as part of her sentence for the necklace theft.

Pulling no punches: Judge Stephanie Sautner revoked Lohan's probation pending a hearing

Arrest: Lohan's sex is incorrectly listed as 'male' on her booking sheet processed today following her court appearance

The actress' once promising movie career has been derailed by multiple trips to jail and rehab since 2007.

The judge dismissed Lohan's lawyer Holley's argument that the actress had to go abroad to work, where she has been seen partying over recent weeks in Europe.

'She is supposed to be an actress from what I hear,' Sautner said.

Holley admitted that 'unfortunately' Lohan's career opportunity are not in America right now and that she has been to Europe to earn money to support herself and her family.

But Sautner was more concerned about the logistics of how Lohan had attended weekly appointments with her U.S.-based shrink, which was part of the terms of her probation.

While the psychological report said she had attended every week, Sautner was doubtful, pointing to the time frames of Lindsay's flights between various European destinations.

Judge Sautner was sceptical about the glowing report written about Lindsay by the Probation Service.  In the 
documents, the actress' probation officer says her psychotherapist 
believes she is 'doing really well, she is making changes, and is trying
to become more disciplined in her actions' and that she is 'turning her
life around'.  The report also says she has been going to therapy every 
week, which the judge disputed because of Lohan's travels overseas. The 
report details how Lohan said the women's shelter community service was not 'fulfilling' - which was also slammed by the judge

Troubled: Lohan and her bail bondsman will now have to deal with the paperwork to get her released from custody

Familiar scene: An outside view of the Airport Courthouse in Los Angeles where Lohan attended today

Lindsay Lohan was given a leave of absence from her shoplifting course to have emergency dental work done.

It came just two days after her red carpet appearance in Los Angeles where she displayed shockingly discoloured teeth.

The actress's probation report detailed various dates of her excused absences from probation, including October 14 for a trip to the dentist.

'Ms. Lohan has not been absent to any regularly scheduled activities, 
except the session scheduled for her on Friday, October 14, 2011 due to 
her need to seek dental work,' the report stated.

'Client presented evidence of attending her dentist office. As a result her absence was excused.'

Lohan now has her Hollywood smile back in place after having her teeth fixed.
