Royal Mail has pleaded with the public to stop taking matters into their own hands by painting its postboxes in honour of Team GB's medal winners.

The company spoke out as its initial gesture to colour postboxes gold in recognition of our Olympic winners looked in danger of spiralling out of control.

However, it appears it has a confused approach to the problem as today it allowed one 'illegally' painted box to remain gold.

Royal Mail has asked the public to stop painting its postboxes after a man was arrested for allegedly spray-painting one in the town where gold-medal sailor Ben Ainslie lives

A post box in Lymington, Hampshire, where gold-medal
sailor Ben Ainslie lives, was painted gold without the company's 
authorisation.

Rob Smith, 54, was arrested but later released without charge and at the same time Royal Mail performed a U-turn and announced that the postbox would keep its new golden colour.

Another box, in Doddington, Lincolnshire, was painted
bronze to congratulate the British 
women's hockey team, who beat New Zealand in a third-place play-off.

A Royal Mail spokeswoman told the Guardian: 'We understand the sentiment 
and congratulate the women's hockey team on their achievement.

'However, 
we'd rather people left the painting of postboxes to us. We are liaising
with our engineers to ensure that it is repainted red as soon as 
possible.'

Mr Smith decided to paint the Lymington postbox in an apparent protest that Royal Mail had instead
chosen to paint one gold in Cornwall, where Ainslie was brought up.

Mr Smith, who owns a bar and restaurant at Lymington Yacht Haven, described the climbdown as a victory for common sense.

He said: 'I’m over the moon. It’s all I ever wanted for Ben, for Lymington, and everyone who has supported the campaign.

'Thousands of people wanted the post box to be painted gold - I’m just the person who did it.

'I’m so glad now it’s going to be done officially. I think the Royal Mail has been swayed by public opinion and has taken a very sensible decision.'

The
four-time Olympic gold medallist has lived in the Hampshire coastal 
town for 12 years and is an honorary life member of the Royal Lymington 
Yacht Club.

Explaining it's U-turn, a Royal Mail spokesman said: 'There’s been a huge amount of interest in this.

'We understand the depth of feeling involved as Ben is a local hero and sailing is very much part of the Lymington community. Ben loves the gold post box in Restronguet but would love to have one in
Lymington as well and we’re happy to oblige.'

Taking matters into their own hands: Supporters of bronze medal-winning boxer Anthony Ogogo painted this Royal Mail postbox in his hometown of Lowestoft, Suffolk,  in honour of his achievements

'Miserable': Peter Moran was dismayed to find the postbox he painted gold in honour of his neighbour Alistair Brownlee has been returned to its original red

A Facebook campaign backing a golden postbox in Lymington attracted more than 1,700 supporters.

Ainslie also described Mr Smith as a 'legend of Lymington' for painting the box gold.

It was latest in a long line of incidents over the last fortnight.

Fans of Olympic bronze medal boxer Anthony Ogogo struck in his hometown of Lowestoft in Suffolk.

A postbox that was painted gold in Jessica Ennis's home city to celebrate her Olympic triumph has also been vandalised.

And a pensioner who painted a postbox gold in honour of Olympic gold medalist Alistair Brownlee has branded Royal Mail 'miserable' after it quickly covered over his handiwork.

Peter Moran, 82, was inspired to pick up a paintbrush after watching his neighbours the Brownlee brothers secure the gold and bronze medals in the gruelling triathlon last Tuesday.
