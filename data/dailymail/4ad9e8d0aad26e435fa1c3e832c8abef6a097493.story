What a terrible afternoon to be Newcastle manager Alan Pardew.

His flailing side were derided by their own supporters, who had made a 660-mile round-trip, were 2-0 down within 20 minutes and flattered by the final scoreline.

Newcastle are yet to win after their four Barclays Premier League games and host Hull next weekend, the first time Pardew will have faced the club since he butted David Meyler on the touchline and was given a seven-match ban by the Football Association and a £100,000 fine by his club.

There were calls for him to be sacked then. A defeat next weekend and Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is not likely to be so lenient.

From the opening minute at St Mary’s it was an onslaught. Just 24 seconds in, a terrible back-pass to goalkeeper Tim Krul allowed Shane Long to charge down his clearance. The ball fell inches wide of the right post.

Three minutes later Southampton should have had a penalty when Long raced on to a ball over the top, headed it around Krul only to be clattered by the goalkeeper inside the box. Referee Chris Foy gave nothing.

But six minutes of sustained pressure straight from the kick-off resulted in the opening goal. Ryan Bertrand crossed for Graziano Pelle who was left free to head in from five yards out. At that point chants of ‘We want Pardew out’ and ‘Alan Pardew, it’s never your fault’ began from theNewcastle fans. After Southampton made it 2-0 in the 19th minute, the chants got worse.

Pardew blamed that poor start for the result. ‘The early goals put us on the back foot,’ he said. ‘We made individual mistakes that we couldn’t absorb. We have to take that as a team.

‘We had a great chance at 2-0 and half a chance after that. We have played OK at the start of the season and really got caught out.

‘We didn’t have long to prepare after the internationals but there’s no excuse really. The players tried everything at 2-0. We just got caught at the start.’

The manner of the second goal did not help tempers. Southampton were hosting their annual Carnival Day, but they did not expect to welcome a Newcastle back line who defended like clowns.

Long played a long diagonal ball from his own half and Michael Williamson headed straight to Pelle. Krul was off his line and Pelle shot first time, but his volley skewed to Dusan Tadic. He ran into the box and passed back to Pelle to tap in his fourth goal in three games.

The ‘We want Pardew out’ cries became even more feverish and when Southampton fans started up a chant of ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’ it was taken over and carried on in the away end. Pardew remained sitting in the dugout, unmoved.

He was still there, hunched forward with his elbows on his knees, when more calamitous defending from his side allowed Southampton to score a third in the 54th minute. 

Toby Alderweireld, Southampton

The loan signing from Atletico Madrid returned a calmness to Southampton's defence which Dejan Lovren, sold to Liverpool, provided so much last season. He looks like a ball-playing centre-half who reads the game well.

The Italian striker scored 50 goals in two seasons at Dutch side Feyenoord before joining Southampton this summer. 

Pelle, 29, spent his teen years at Lecce, from where he was sent out on loan three times in two years, before signing for AZ Alkmaar, where he scored 14 times in 78 appearances. He moved to Parma in 2011 but played only 12 games, scoring just once, before going on loan to Sampdoria and then Feyenoord. Since his arrival at Southampton, he has scored three goals in four games and looks good for many more. 

Steven Davis played a through-ball from deep, Williamson let it run for Krul, only for Jack Cork to steal in, round the goalkeeper and score. It was Cork’s first league goal for Southampton in three years at the club — League One defences had never allowed him that privilege. Those Newcastle chants started up again.

And there was no letting up from Southampton, who made it four in stoppage time when Morgan Schneiderlin curled the ball into the top right corner.

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman had little sympathy for his counterpart. Asked about the chants, he replied: ‘It’s always difficult, it’s part of our job.

‘You have to concentrate every day and focus every day. It’s football, it’s going fast. If it goes badly, you have to wait to win again. If you don’t like it you have to do something different.’

There were flashes, however brief, from the away side. 

Moussa Sissoko hit a first-time shot straight at Fraser Forster in the first half and Jack Colback, stretching, missed an open goal from two yards out in the second. That just about summed up their afternoon.

Unless results pick up, Pardew’s four-year tenure at the club is coming to its end.
