Chelsea scored an important away goal as they drew 1-1 with PSG in the first-leg of their round of 16 tie against PSG in the Champions League. 

Here, Sportsmail's Rob Draper rates every player for their performance at the Parc des Princes. 

PSG (4-3-3)   

Salvatore Sirigu 6.5 - Not over tested by Chelsea and comfortable when required. Could do nothing to stop Ivanovic header on 36 minutes

Gregory van der Wiel 6 - Enthusiastic supporter of attacks down the right – not truly tested by Hazard in defence. 

 Cesc Fabregas looks impervious in midfield, producing another fine display for Chelsea

Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois made a string of fine saves against PSG 

Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic rises highest to open the scoring at the Parc des Princes

Marquinhos 5.5 - Seemed slack when Chelsea opened the scoring. Should have been tighter on Gary Cahill and allowed him to provide the all-important flick

Thiago Silva 6 - Solid in defence but didn't marshall his troops as Chelsea stole through to score the opening goal.

Maxwell 6 - Joined attack when necessary and contained Willian well enough. Decent performance.

Marco Verratti 6.5 - Tireless as ever, intelligent in his passing but Chelsea closed him down quickly

David Luiz 6.5 - Looked imperious at times in that midfield holding role, but was man closest to Ivanovic as he opened the scoring. Wasn't having any of Diego Costa's chat.

Blaise Matuidi 6.5 - Was guilty of an awful ball when PSG had a first-half chance to break on Chelsea. Redeemed himself with excellent run and cross for equaliser

Ezequiel Lavezzi 6.5 - Enthusiastically supported attacks, cut wide. Looked to have scored the winner but for Azpilicueta's clearance on the hour

Zlatan Ibrahimovic 6.5 - Enigmatic, moody, charismatic: looked the part but was with without good service for much of the game. Denied at the death by superb Courtois save.

Edinson Cavani 7 - PSG's danger man: lovely glancing header on 34 minutes which tested Courtois. Beautiful jump and header for the goal. How he will rue that late miss after dribbling past three Chelsea defenders.

CHELSEA (4-3-3) 

Thibaut Courtois 7.5 - Superb save right at the death from Ibrahimovic to keep tie in Chelsea's favour. No fault for goal and excellent save early on, notably from Cavani 

Branislav Ivanovic 6- Towering header to score but Chelsea lost Matuidi on the right side for the equalising goal 

Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard is fouled by Blaise Matuidi (left) and Marquinhos (right) 

Gary Cahill 5.5 - Rare assist with a hopeful flick of the ball for the opening goal; but missed header which allowed Cavani to score

John Terry 7 - Organised, cajoled and generally was a strong presence, especially in the opening 30 minutes when PSG set out to attack

Cesar Azpilicueta 6.5-  Consistency is his watchword. Superb goal-line clearance on the hour to deny Lavezzi

Ramires 6.5 - Gave Chelsea running and defensive surety. Performed his given role – no frills, just did the job. 

Nemanja Matic 7 - As above but with a degree more authority and some intelligent passing

Willian 6 - Toiled and tried but his game isn't made for these cautious away days

Cesc Fabegas 7 - Excellent in both application of defensive work and his passing decisions

Eden Hazard 6 - Occasionally found space to threaten but team as mostly in counter attack mode

Diego Costa 6 - Did his duties but Mourinho was right; he wasn't at his best. Willing to get involved with David Luiz despite having nothing to do with original argument 

PSG manager Laurent Blanc looks incensed as he shouts instructions to his players from the touchline 

REFEREE 

Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey) 6 - Got the big calls right and generally stayed in control. Didn't let either team intimidate 

MANAGERS

Jose Mourinho 7 - European nights don't catch him out. Cautious early on and then the away goal provided an excellent foundation – but Chelsea curiously slack letting in equalsier

Laurent Blanc 6 - His side did most of the attacking in the early stages of the game but could have been more ambitious. Chelsea were cautious until their opening goal. Conceding that scuppered his best-laid plans
