A group of tourists has had a wildlife encounter they will never forget while watching a humpback whale feeding frenzy that was caught on camera.

The awestruck holidaymakers looked on as one of the massive whales lunged out of the ocean just a few feet from their boat.

It happened during a pod feeding frenzy in Monterrey Bay on the Pacific Ocean, around four miles off the coast of Moss Landing, California.

The 90-second video shows excited tourists cheering and laughing as the whale breaks the surface of the choppy ocean.

Sea lions scramble around the whales and gulls scatter into the air as the pod lunge feeding takes place next to the boat.

Michael Sack, captain and co-owner of Sanctuary Cruises, captured the thrilling moment on camera.

He was just as excited as the tourists as the whale lunged out of the water. He shouted: ‘That was insane, holy frickin’ cow!’

Acrobats: Humpbacks frequently ‘jump’ out of the water and slap the surface with their fins

Pod lunge feeding: Humpback whales can consume up to 3,000 pounds of food per day

The humpback whale diet consists of tiny crustaceans, plankton and small fish, and they can consume up to 3,000 pounds of food per day, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Humpback whales are a popular draw for tourists, given their size and acrobatic nature.

They frequently ‘jump’ out of the water and slap the surface with their pectoral fins.
