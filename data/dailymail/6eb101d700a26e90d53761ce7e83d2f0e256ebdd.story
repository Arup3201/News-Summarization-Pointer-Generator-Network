A Dutch pensioner, 91, has had the words 'do not resuscitate' tattooed across her chest in a right-to-die protest.

Nel Bolten, from The Hague in the Netherlands, says she had the ink, which also states she is over 91, because she does not want emergency crews to bring her back to life if she stops breathing.

Despite ambulance services previously stating they would not accept the tattoo as valid, Dutch health minister, Edith Schippers, has confirmed it is a legal declaration.

Nel Bolten from the Netherlands said she had the tattoo because she does not want to be revived by medics

The 15cm-wide body art will lawfully allow Ms Bolten the right to self determination to end her life - a complex issue in the Netherlands, which has an increasing population of elderly people. 

A spokesman for the health minister confirmed the legislative change to Dutch Association for Voluntary End of Life (NVVE), according to Dutch media reports.

The organisation says on its website that it is 'for everyone who wants to die with dignity'.

'We want the best possible implementation of euthanasia, especially for groups that do not get help in practice, such as people with dementia, chronic psychiatric patients and elderly people who feel that their life is complete,' it says.

NVVE currently offers its members what it calls a 'not-resuscitate penning', which is essentially an ID tag stating the person's name, date of birth, a photograph and a signature on a necklace.

It is a statement to a first-aider that the patient does not want to have CPR administrated on them, however, there has been issues in that medics have been unable to find them.

The 15cm-wide tattoo across her chest, which reads 'Do not resuscitate, I'm 91+', has now been accepted as a legal declaration as a right to die by the Dutch health minister, Edith Schippers

The idea of a tattoo was hoped to be a bolder statement after Ms Bolten said she did not trust the necklaces.

She told a Dutch newspaper: 'I've seen on TV that it was a matter of seconds for ambulance staff - they really don't look for a necklace.

'I do not want to end up as a vegetable in a chair.'

Ms Bolten had worked with Ms Schippers to try and make the statement tattoos a formal and legal declaration to medics - and she is not the only person to have one. 

In 2012 an 88-year-old Dutch woman had a similar tattoo done on her left breast to let her last wishes be known.

While Peter Hagens, 61, from Muiden in the Netherlands is another person who has braved it and had the ink tattooed on his chest.
