Arrested: Quaneisha Torres is facing attempted murder charges after her husband was run over

A 21-year-old Virginia woman is facing attempted murder charges for allegedly driving into her husband with a minivan and then beating him at the roadside.

Concerned motorists started to call police at about 10.30pm on Sunday to report a woman kicking a man next to a wrecked vehicle.

Quaneisha Torres is accused of driving her minivan in the wrong direction along a one-way street, before smashing into her husband who was on the edge of the road.

Witnesses claimed that as the 31-year-old, who has not been named, tried to crawl away from the wreckage, a 5ft 4in woman, who weighed about 200lb, began kicking him.

Police told WUSA 9 that other drivers had called 911 to report seeing a minivan going in the wrong direction before crashing into a guard rail.

The witnesses claimed to see a man crawl out from under the wreckage, only to be kicked by the woman driver of the minivan.

Officers reported that when they arrived at the scene, they found Torres standing over the bloodied body of her husband.

It is believed the husband had been walking on the road when his wife, who was following him in a vehicle, ran into him.
