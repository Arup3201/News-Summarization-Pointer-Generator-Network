This is a vision of what might be the future of Wimbledon, the world’s greatest tennis tournament which starts tomorrow.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the All England Lawn Tennis Club is planning a multi-million-pound expansion on to the golf course that borders its famous courts.

It has been confirmed that the new Wimbledon will incorporate a venue to stage the qualifying tournament for the showpiece Grand Slam  event – these matches are currently played in nearby Roehampton.

Now speculation is mounting that in years to come it will feature a spectacular new show court, a hotel and even a statue of current men’s champion Andy Murray.

In an exclusive interview with this newspaper, All England Club chairman Philip Brook revealed the club will expand on to land currently leased out to the neighbouring Wimbledon Park Golf Club.

The All England Club bought the freehold of the golf club from Merton Council for £5.2 million in 1993.

The golf club’s 800 members – who include former Cabinet Secretary Lord O’Donnell and television presenters Ant and Dec – have been told that the All England Club has rejected pleas for a new lease.

The decision is a bitter blow to golf club members who had hoped they would be allowed to keep a nine-hole course.

Mr Brook said: ‘When we bought the golf club’s land we had the long term in mind and when the lease runs out, building courts there and moving our qualification event from Roehampton to on-site will make sense.

‘It’s a few years away and we’ve so much to do already with what we are planning at the moment that we are focused on that.’

‘The only way to stay at the top is to keep working hard to continually improve. It’s that ethos. We look  at our rivals, they look at us.

‘We consider ourselves to be the premier tennis tournament in the world and we want to stay there.’

Sources close to the club say this ambition requires major developments and envisage long-term projects including a new amphitheatre-style show court, more corporate hospitality venues, a shopping village, public catering, picnic areas and a top lakeside restaurant.

Dipesh Patel, director at Pattern Architects, who is working on a stadium design for the 2022 football World Cup in Qatar, said: ‘If I were advising Wimbledon, I would tell them that for the new site they should focus on more hospitality including exclusive suites and high-end restaurants.

‘The inclusion of an iconic feature, such as Murray Mound, is also essential. Those are the details that people know around the world and have helped Wimbledon become  the force it is today.’

Money is no object for the tennis club. The Wimbledon tournament generated £37.8 million profits in 2012. The club has predicted it will raise £100 million from debentures alone before 2020. Officially, there is still 27 years before the golf club’s lease expires but there is already talk of the tennis club offering the golfers a sweetener to leave far sooner. A recent letter from the golf club to members said: ‘We should most sensibly assume that our lease will not be renewed in 2041, not even for a nine-hole course.’

One member said: ‘It’s terribly sad to lose a 100-year-old golf club. The council should never have been allowed to sell it [the freehold]. I know we could have bid for it but it was our members’ money being pitted against the might of  the tennis club, and we didn’t have a chance.’

If the All England Club wants to include new permanent structures on the golf course, it will have to upgrade the planning status of the land. ‘That won’t be a serious problem,’ said the golf club member. ‘The tennis club knows how valuable the tournament is to Wimbledon and the council will do all it can to help them.

The last time there was a really serious difference of opinion the All England Club threatened to move their whole operation to Basingstoke and the council caved in immediately.’

Tennis fans hoping for an autograph from a Wimbledon star face disappointment after the club built a tunnel so players don’t have to mingle with the public.

The tunnel, shown in a plan above, goes from a car park outside the grounds into the players’ lounge. There will be guards at its entrance. Club chairman Philip Brook said: ‘We have built it to protect the privacy of the players. Fans will still be able to get autographs at a designated area.’

The club has not confirmed if the tunnel will be open this week.
