From full size inflatable dolls to the My Knitted Boyfriend doll created by Dutch artist Noortje de Keijzer, there's no shortage of bedtime companions for lonely singletons.

But one Japanese company has taken matters one step further with the launch of a body pillow that comes complete with gel inserts in the buttocks and breasts.

Just in case (presumably) male shoppers aren't clear how it works, the makers Nitroplus have produced a video showing the pillow's assets being poked and squeezed as well as a sequence featuring the gels themselves.

Realistic? Makers Nitroplus hope this squeezy Super Sonico hug pillow will prove popular with Japanese men

Silicone: The doll's buttock and breast implants are similar to those used on cosmetically enhanced humans

The pillow is based on a popular Japanese computer game character called Super Sonico who features in Nitroplus' visual novels and 'eroge' erotic software.

The pink-haired Super Sonico made her debut in 2007 and proved an instant hit with Japanese men, who found other characters such as the demure Hatsune Miku a little too demure.

Last summer, the company launched a version of the pillow with squeezable breast inserts but decided to up the ante with this summer's launch.

Strange though the Super Soniko pillow seems, it is far from the being the first unusual companion for lonely males dreamed up by a Japanese company.

Squeezable: The breast implants can be poked as much as the owner likes - as the demo video reveals

Plastic: The pillows contain silicone implants similar to those used by breast enlargement surgeons

Along with vending machines that sell used knickers, last September saw the launch of Soineya, a cafe that lets men cuddle up to pretty women for a small fee.

Recently, the hugely popular venture launched a 'oshiri makura' service which lets visitors rest their heads on the women's bottoms in the privacy of a private booth.

Sadly for those men looking for a comfortable derriere on which to rest their head, a minute of oshiri makura time costs 1,000 yen (£6.50) - £390 an hour.
