Most in-demand celebrity attributes can either be yours forever; a nose job, for example, or very temporarily; the smoky eye look, say. The former is a drastic gamble, and the latter is a cheap thrill.

So when Femail noticed the rising trend for eyebrow tattoos that eventually fade - a process which involves filling in your brows with micro-fine 'hairs' that are inked onto the skin - we jumped at the chance to try it.

Lasting for between 14 months and two years, and costing in the region of $700-$1,000; semi-permanent eyebrow tattoos promise to bestow you with  Cara Delevingne worthy power-brows for a good while, but not forever.Â

Spot the difference: Before I had my eyebrows tattooed, they were fairly sparse 
in places (left), but my hour-long session with a scalpel certainly 
fixed that (right) pictured a few days after the procedure

Before: Thanks to an overzealous attack with the tweazers when I was a teen, parts of my brows never fully grew back, leaving me with slightly patchy areas (pictured)

After: This was taken directly after the procedure, when the dye was still heavy and before my brows had settled down into a more natural state

My natural brows have always provided me with somewhat of a conundrum. When I was younger, they were so bushy that I once let a friend - with particularity strong feelings against their bushiness - go absolutely mad on them with tweezers. They never fully grew back.

I was left with brows that are bold in some places, and randomly sparse in others. So, like many women, I've taken to filling in the odd gaps - crudely and unevenly I might add - with my Anastasia brow pencil.

Eager to try out this much-hyped, longer-lasting solution, I enlisted the services of Browhaus; a New York salon which has seen a sharp increase in demand for their $925 'Brow Resurrection' service, among models and mortals alike.

Browhaus has perfected what they describe as 'an advanced brow embroidery technique' which involves tattooing onto the skin with exceptionally detailed and natural strokes.

Gearing up: To lessen the pain - but not entirely diminish it as I would later discover - I had numbing cream applied to my brows prior to the treatment, held in place for 15 minutes using Saran wrap (pictured)

Tools of the trade: The assortment of dyes and the dreaded scalpel instrument (left) and me doing my best impression of someone who is not freaking out, as the sharp blade is dragged across my brows (right)

Entering with more than a little trepidation - a semi-permanent tattoo is still an un-hidable addition to your face, let's not forget - I was first treated to a consultation with the salon's senior brow specialist, Michelle.

After discussing my options, I opted to go for the natural look, and Michelle carefully worked on my patchy brows with a dark pencil to get the shape right; essentially lengthening them and filling in the gaps, so as to more closely resemble their shape before the tweezers-attack incident.

After plucking away a few stray hairs, and then letting a numbing gel sit on my brows for 15 minutes, it was time to get started.

Stretched out under a stark lamp on what closely resembled a dentist's chair, panic set in when Michelle calmly lifted a glinting, scalpel-like instrument from the tray to my left.

Inking away: The process takes about an hour and a half from start to finish, and the experience feels not unlike going to the dentist

My initial reaction: Upon first inspection, I was pretty traumatized by my new brows, which I worried were far too dark and blockish, more Bert from Seseme Street than Cara Delevingne

Success: A week on from my treatment (pictured), and my brows have settled into normality. Gone are the sparse patches, and I'm really pleased with how natural the results are

I was told this wouldn't hurt much, but unsurprisingly, as she took the blade to my brows and started intricately scratching away at my skin, it became less and less comfortable - despite the numbing cream.

Michelle carefully etched the brown ink back and forth across my brow-line with what I hoped were realistic strokes for about half an hour; pausing periodically to check the symmetry and admire her work.

Once she was done, I crossed my fingers and braved the handheld mirror. My knee-jerk response: Heaven help me, I look like Bert from Seseme Street.

back and forth across my brow-line with what I hoped were realistic 
strokes'

In my typically over-polite fashion, I thanked Michelle profusely and left like a deer in the headlights, scattering back to the office with my very dark, very bold power-brows in tow.

'They are definitely not too dark, I would tell you if they were,' my editor assured me, in her equally over-polite manner. I could tell she was fibbing.

One week, and several showers later, however, I'm pleased to report a total turn around. The color has faded and they look much less aggressive.

Queen of the brows: Cara Delevingne (pictured) exploded onto the scene in 2011, rising fast to supermodel stardom and sporting bold eyebrows which have since amassed a cult following

The brow brigade: Kim Kardashian (left) is blessed with chunky eyebrows, as is Megan Fox (center) and Brooke Shields was the star to bring bushy brows into style for her generation in the 80s

Browhaus tell me the intensity will continue to fade as they heal, for about six to 10 days, and my editor concedes that the color is perfect, honestly this time.

'For just shy of $1,000 and a manageable 
level of pain, I am proud to be 
sporting strong, natural-looking brows'

For just shy of $1,000, a manageable level of pain, and only a short-lived period of panic, I am proud to be sporting strong, natural-looking brows which I don't have to draw on every morning.

Although I regret to report that I still look nothing like Miss Delevingne, I'm a total convert to the movement of the semi-permanent eyebrow tattoo.
