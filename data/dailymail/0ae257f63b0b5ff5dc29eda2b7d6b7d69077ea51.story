Serial felon: Peter Jones, 46, whose father is a retired university professor, is charged with strangling and stabbing pensioner Bernice Schaufele in the neck in her condominium in Novi, Michigan, on January 13

An ex-convict accused of murdering his 84-year-old neighbour should have been behind bars at the time of her killing ... but was walking free on jail credit that he was not entitled to, it has been reported.

Peter Jones, 46, whose father is a retired university professor, is charged with strangling and stabbing pensioner Bernice Schaufele in the neck in her condominium in Novi, Michigan, on January 13.

But an investigation by the Detroit Free Press has revealed that the former engineering student turned crack addict was given 1,825 days of jail credit that he wasn’t allowed under Michigan law while serving time for a fatal stabbing in Detroit in 1998.

He had been in and out of prison for robbery and burglary and had been convicted of a brutal attack on a Florida cab driver in 1997 and a fatal stabbing in Detroit a year later.

It was for those two crimes that he received the credit, but nobody in either state corrections office could say why.

'There is nothing that allows him to have credit under the case law of the State of Michigan (for the time he served in Florida),' said Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office. 'There may have been a factual reason to allow him to have the credit, but we don’t know because the people handling the case don’t have a memory of it because it’s so old.'

Had he not been given those 1,825 days of jail credit, his earliest possible release date from prison — based on a formula — would have been February 6, Michigan Department of Corrections told the Free Press.

Kim Lukacs, Schaufele’s daughter, said: 'All the things that he has done and the severity of his crimes ... it doesn’t make sense. Why was he out? I just don’t understand it.'

Jones, whose father is a retired professor  emeritus of education at Florida A&M University, comes from a high-flying family including a brother who is an orthopedic-surgeon, sister who is a physician and another sister who is a high-ranking member of the U.S. Airforce.

But while studying for his own degree in engineering at Florida A&M, Jones began dabbling in crack and soon slid into a life of petty crime to fund his habit, snatching purses and mugging ATM users.

That, however, soon turned to assault and then murder.

Quiet street: Mrs Schaufele's body was found around 2:45 p.m. on January 13 inside her condominium on West Glen Haven Circle in Novi, Michigan

In 1997 he attacked Anthony Davis, a Yellow Cab driver, after he picked him up in Leon County, Florida, stabbing him in the arm before trying to strangle him with his radio-mic cord.

The fight spilled out of the cab and Jones fled when another motorist approached, leaving Davis injured but alive. A warrant was put out for his arrest.

A year later the Florida fugitive murdered Cory Hardy, a small-time drug runner, stabbing him 32 times as he baby-sat a drug house in Detroit, Michigan.

He was finally picked up in 1999 in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana for robbery and possession of eight rocks of crack cocaine.

With warrants in both Florida and Michigan for his arrest, it became a race between authorities in both states to get to get there first and bring him to justice. Florida won.

'He should have been located after the warrant was issued — he wasn’t,' Michigan prosecutor Kim Worthy said in a statement last week. 'Years later, we should have been 
able to trump Florida in getting him first — we couldn’t match their 
resources.'

He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in 2002 to five years in prison and given 883 days of jail credit for time served while waiting for sentencing.

His Florida prison sentence ended in 2005 and he was returned to Michigan to face charges for Cory Hardy’s killing.

In 2006, he was sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison, receiving credit for 278 days for the time he had spent behind bars waiting to be prosecuted for that killing.

Then, in January 2007, the Florida Department of Corrections told Jones he had served 942 days in prison there, and had 883 days of credit while he awaited sentencing, for a total of 1,825.

The next month, Jones was allowed to carry over his credit for the time served in Florida to his jail time for the Michigan murder. Exact details of the deal struck are not clear.

'So Jones ended up getting credit in Michigan for all the days he served in Florida for the attack on Davis,' reports the Free Press. 'Michigan authorities can’t explain why his jail stay in Michigan was shortened by the time he was credited on an unrelated case in Florida.'

But he should have been in jail for murder of drug runner in 1998 in Detroit

However, jail time for that crime was shortened because of credit he received for time served for the brutal attack on a Florida cab driver in 1997
