Gerry Adams will not be prosecuted over the murder of Jean McConville or membership of the IRA because of a lack of evidence, it was suggested last night.

Prosecutors already believe there is insufficient material to convict him of either offence, the BBC claimed.

It came less than 24 hours after police said they would pass a file to Northern Ireland’s Public Prosecution Service within a week.

Gerry Adams, pictured with Deputy First Minister if Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness, was released without charge after arrest over the 1972 abduction and murder of Jean McConville

Meanwhile, Adams’ wife Collette has been warned by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) of a credible death threat against him.

Tensions continued to rise yesterday amid a war of words in the aftermath of the incendiary arrest and 96-hour detention of the Republican leader.

Adams denies any involvement in the abduction, murder or secret burial of mother-of-ten Mrs McConville by a masked gang in 1972.

But her son Michael McConville said yesterday that the Sinn Fein leader personally warned him of a ‘backlash’ if he publicly identified those responsible.

Mr McConville, who was 11 when he watched his screaming mother dragged out of their family home, said he knew several of those involved. He was warned soon after her disappearance that he would also be shot if he told police.

Free to go? As prosecutors allegedly believe there is insufficient material to convict him, the Sinn Fein leader, pictured being hugged by a well-wished outside the party offices in Belfast, will not be prosecuted

After campaigning to bring the killers to justice, Mr McConville attended meetings with IRA members brokered by Adams between 2004 and 2006.

He said: ‘Gerry Adams says to me “Michael, you are getting a letter of support from the Republican people”.

'He says “If you release the names I hope you are ready for the backlash”. I took it as a threat.’

Mr McConville said that even if Adams told him he was now safe to ‘name names’ he  would refuse.

‘I don’t trust Gerry Adams. If I told their names something would happen to me or my family,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

Adams has denied he threatened Mr McConville with a backlash if he released the names.

The BBC’s Northern Ireland home affairs correspondent, Vincent Kearney, said in an article on the Corporation’s website on Sunday that there was not much prospect that there would be a charge, unless significant new evidence emerged.

But Mrs McConville’s daughter, Helen McKendry, said there is no doubt in the minds of many people that Adams played a key role in  the IRA.

She told the Mail: ‘The  dogs in the street knew he  was the leader of the IRA in our area at the time of my mother’s abduction.’

Mrs McKendry also met with Adams in 1995 and was unconvinced by his promise to help.

She said: ‘He told me he was there to listen to my story and to hear who I thought was responsible. But he couldn’t look me in the eye.’

Yesterday, Sinn Fein Stormont Assembly member Raymond McCartney said a PSNI officer had told Adams’ wife Collette that ‘they had information of a credible threat to the life of Gerry, who was not at home at the time’.

He added: ‘Clearly there are elements that are opposed to the peace process and anti-Sinn Fein.’
