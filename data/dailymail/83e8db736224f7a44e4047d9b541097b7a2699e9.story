A Florida man arrested in connection to his wife's murder after posting a graphic photo of her blood-splattered body on his Facebook page played a tattooed, violent gang member in a TV show and wants to be famous.

In a message that appeared on his personal Facebook account Thursday morning, 31-year-old Derek Medina, of Miami, allegedly admitted to the murder of his wife, 26-year-old Jennifer Alfonso.

'Im going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife love you guys miss you guys takecare Facebook people you will see me in the news,' he wrote.

'My wife was punching me and I am not going to stand anymore with the abuse so I did what I did I hope u understand me.'

Medina supplemented the photo 
apparently showing his murdered spouse lying in the kitchen with blood 
covering her face and left arm with the comment: 'Rip Jennifer Alfonso.'

MailOnline chose to obscure the image due to its extremely graphic and disturbing nature.

Father's agony: Medina's father, Derek Medina Sr, said that his son came to him and admitted to killing his wife because she allegedly threatened him with a knife

Kayla Amando Pabon wrote about the woman in the grisly image: 'That is my friend there.' 

Medina was a part time actor on the USA 
Network show Burn Notice.

The wannabe star boasted online about his tiny bit-part appearances and dreamed of fame that he never quite attained. He appeared only as a backgound extra with his head-shaved and pouting in two episodes in 2010.

However, that didn't stop his talking up his achievements.

Posting a video on You Tube, he narrated: 'Put on USA, I’m coming out on the episode right now. I’m on USA. I’m going to come out soon. This is the episode that I filmed. hat’s me right there! You saw me?'

The page also has a clip of a man kicking a punching bag in a gym. 

In an interview with the local station WSVN, Medina's father, Derek Medina Sr., said that his son came to him at around 11am Thursday and admitted to shooting his wife.

Last post: Jennifer Alfonso was last active on Facebook on August 7, changing her profile picture to a photo of her kissing a man believed to be Medina

‘He just said that his wife picked up a knife on him, and they had a big fight, and he shot her,’ said the father.

The elder Medina drove his son to a South Miami police station, where the 31-year-old turned himself in.

Derek
 Medina Sr said that girl who was removed from the apartment wrapped in a
 blanket is Alfonso’s daughter from a previous relationship.

According to the father, his son had a rocky relationship with Alfonso. He said that the two got a divorce after being married for three years, but tied the knot again last year.

Alfonso listed her occupation as a server at Denny's. Records show that she married Medina in April 2012.

The woman was last active on Facebook Wednesday, some 15 hours before the image of her body appeared on her husband's page. At the time, Alfonso changed her profile picture to a photo of her kissing Medina.

Miami New Times reported that Medina has published a number of self-help e-books, among them one titled: 'How I Saved Someone's Life and Marriage and Family Problems Thru Communication.'

His works, mostly bearing odd and lengthy titles, are available through the site e-junkie priced between $999 and $11.99. At least one is out in paperback selling for $19.99.

Self-help guru: Medina has published a number of bizarrely titled e-books covering topics from marriage problems to apocalypse and alines

His latest offering is 'World Just Ask Yourself Why We Are Living a Life Full of Lies and How I an Emotional Writer Made All of My Professional Dreams Come True Blocking Society's Teachings.'

In a summary of one book, Medina claims he can hunt ghosts and at one time saved his wife from a poltergeist attack while they were in New York.

Elsewhere in his writings, Medina talked about his experiences with aliens and lamented that humans are not working on a time travel machine needed for an 'evacuation plan.'
