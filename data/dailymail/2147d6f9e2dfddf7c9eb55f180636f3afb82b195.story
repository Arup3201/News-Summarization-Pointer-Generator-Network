A North Carolina diner has introduced an optimistic new pricing format - leaving it all in the hands of God.

Just Cookin, based in Dallas, N.C. and owned by Dana Parris, announced its new menu system last week with a Facebook post that read: 'I am letting go and letting GOD!! No prices… no totals… you pay what you think your meal is worth!!!'

According to Grubstreet, Ms Parris experienced a divine intervention after a busy summer of trying to attract new customers, and said: 'The way I could show I was giving God control was to give him control of the cash register.'

The post inspired a great deal of predictable social media chatter, mainly favorable.

'May God Richly Bless You for your Immaculate Belief!' wrote one woman. 'I am Blessed to even share this. Keep Believing in God. You have Wondrously Blessed My Soul. Thank You!'

Others were less ecstatic, with one writing: 'What if I walk in like Jesus with a crew of homeless people, order everything on the menu, hand you a rusted penny?'

Announcement: The restaurant's owner Dana Parris later explained, 'The way I could show I was giving God control was to give him control of the cash register'

Bargain: Prices at Just Cookin (pictured) start at $1.69 for a serving of 'livermush' and run up to $5.99 for 'chopped steak'

The restaurant - which requires employees to wear uniforms that bear the slogan 'Believing' - serves sandwiches, egg platters and burgers, among other options. Prices start at $1.69 for a serving of 'livermush' and run up to $5.99 for 'chopped steak.'

And the establishment certainly enjoyed having the last laugh after the stunt caused its weekly revenue to nearly triple.

'Guess having guests set their prices for their food is unheard of,' Just Cookin announced in a post after the new pricing system was introduced. 

'Faith is a good thing. God is the Great One.'

Appetizing: Just Cookin certainly ended up having the last laugh after the stunt caused its weekly revenue to nearly triple. Pictured, a meal served by the restaurant 

According to Ms Parris, 'only a few' customers didn't pay the going rate for their meals, and the lucrative new policy will now continue 'indefinitely.'

'Just Cookin is a God filled business. We know we can do nothing special,' another post from the restaurant reads. 

'God can do anything and everything!!! We pray this week you feel and see the ALMIGHTY PRESENCE of GOD!!!'
