Controversial TV drama Appropriate Adult and BBC hit Sherlock lead the nominations for the BAFTA Television Awards.

In the shortlist unveiled today, Dominic West received a Best Actor nod for his portrayal of serial killer Fred West, while co-star Emily Watson is up for Best Actress for her performance as 'appropriate adult' Janet Leach.

Their co-star Monica Dolan is up for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Rose West, while the show is nominated for Best Mini-Series.

Controversial: Appropriate Adult, starring Emily Watson as Janet Leach and Dominic West as serial killer Fred West is up for four awards

Sherlock also has four nominations, but only in three categories, with good pitted against evil as Martin Freeman (Watson) takes on Andrew Scott (Moriarty) in Best Supporting Actor.

Benedict Cumberbatch has been nominated for his performance at the detective in the Best Actor category, competing against West, John Simm (Exile) and Joseph Gilgun (This Is England '88).

Following close behind, Channel 4's This Is England '88 has three nominations apiece at the British Academy Television Awards in May.

Last year's Best Actress Vicky McClure is up in the same category again for the series.

Popular: BBC drama Sherlock has received four nominations in three categories, while Channel 4's This Is England '88 has three nods (right)

In a big upset, popular period drama Downton has failed to win over Bafta members, only received one nomination for Best Supporting Actress for Dame Maggie Smith.

However, her co-star Hugh Bonneville is nominated for Male performance in a comedy programme for Twenty Twelve.

Last year, the ITV1 show was up for the YouTube Audience Award and Best Supporting Actor for Brendan Coyle, but missed out on both trophies.

Making a return to the Baftas' comedy category is Jennifer Saunders, who has been nominated for Female performance in a comedy programme in the recent return of Absolutely Fabulous.

Unfortunately for Simon Cowell, Britain's Got Talent and The X Factor failed to receive nods for Best Entertainment Programme, despite being the most watched shows on television.

Instead, Harry Hill's TV Burp, Derren Brown: The Experiments, Michael McIntyre's Christmas Comedy Roadshow and Celebrity Juice will fight it out for the coveted title.

That's fabulous, sweetie: Jennifer Saunders, pictured with co-star Joanna Lumley, has been nominated for her performance in the new Absolutely Fabulous episodes

And in another upset, last year's Audience Award winners The Only Way Is Essex haven't received any nominations at all, although their E4 rival Made In Chelsea is up for Best Reality & Constructed Factual.

Comedienne Miranda Hart, a regular winner at comedy awards, is up for Best Supporting Actress for Call The Midwife, which has proved a big hit on BBC1.

The winners will be announced during a star-studded ceremony on Sunday 27 May.
