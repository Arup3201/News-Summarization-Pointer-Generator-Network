This is the dramatic moment a Greek woman threatened to jump from an Athens office block - because she was about to lose her job because of the euro debt crisis.

Lambrousi Harikleia said she would commit suicide from the second floor of the Labour Housing Organisation building which has been earmarked for closure.

The suicide threat came after Greece's 
Public Order Minister Christos Papoutsis had warned: 'Greece has made 
all the efforts that it needed to do, and the people cannot take any 
more.'

Local media reported that she was eventually led away to safety.

Dramatic: Lambrousi Harikleia today threatened to commit suicide from the second floor of the Labour Housing Organisation building which has been earmarked for closure

The civil servant fears she will lose her job in the new round of cuts that Greece is having to make to meet its debt reduction plan or else miss out on the next chunk of bail-out cash. Happily, she was finally led to safety

But it seems unlikely the eurozone will also have a happy ending as countries
plunged into bitter in-fighting last night as Germany was accused of 
‘insulting’ Greece and trying to force it out of the single currency.

Simmering tensions between members of 
the 17-strong eurozone boiled over when senior Greek ministers lashed 
out at Germany over the tough austerity conditions attached to a second 
£110billion bailout.

In Brussels there was open speculation
that several countries, including Germany, Austria, Finland and the 
Netherlands,  now believe Greece’s exit from the single currency is all 
but inevitable.

One senior official said: ‘There is resentment, mistrust, really bitter debate.’

Germany’s finance minister Wolfgang 
Schaeuble had earlier sparked fury in Greece by suggesting the country 
is a  ‘bottomless pit’.

In an angry rebuttal, the Greek 
president Karolos Papoulias – an 82-year-old veteran of Greece’s 
resistance against the Nazi occupation – said: ‘Who is Mr Schaeuble to 
insult Greece? Who are the Dutch? Who are the Finnish?’

Finance minister Evangelos Venizelos 
warned that fellow eurozone countries were ‘playing with fire’ by edging
Greece towards the exit door.

Italian PM Mario Monti, today told the European Parliament that Germany and France had to share the blame for the crisis.

The man brought in to sort out his 
country’s finances post-Silvio Berlusconi said the economies had both 
breached the Stability And Growth Pact.

Monti also offered Greece support, saying it was too simplistic to label EU states either ‘good’ or ‘bad’.

‘There are many in the eurozone who 
don’t want us any more,’ he said. ‘Our country is waging a battle of 
survival within the eurozone.’

His intervention came amid 
extraordinary scenes in Athens, including one incident in which a woman 
who faced a wage cut and possible redundancy, threatened to jump from 
her office window.

Yesterday it emerged the second 
bailout could be delayed until after Greece’s elections in April – 
heightening concern that Athens could default on its vast debts.

Billionare hedge fund manager John 
Paulson, who predicted the credit crunch, yesterday joined  those 
predicting the euro will ultimately collapse. In a note to investors, he
said: ‘We believe a Greek payment default could be a greater shock to 
the system than Lehman’s failure [in 2008], immediately causing global 
economies to contract and markets to decline.’

And it was not just the Greeks who 
were angry. Mario Monti, Italy’s prime minister, warned that the debt 
crisis was fuelling dangerous divisions within the eurozone and said it 
was wrong to try to divide member states into ‘goodies and baddies’.

Mr Monti said Germany and France must 
share the blame for the eurozone’s problems as they had both breached 
spending rules in the run-up to the crisis.

He told the European Parliament: ‘The 
eurozone crisis has given rise to too many resentments and re-created 
too many stereotypes, it has divided Europe into central countries and 
peripheral ones. All these categories must be decisively rejected.’

German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 
spokesman, Steffen Seibert, sharply rejected suggestions Germany has 
decided a Greek bankruptcy is acceptable. But a close ally of Mrs Merkel
insisted Germany was determined to get binding guarantees from Greece 
before handing over any more cash.

Peter Altmaier said: ‘We have seen 
several times that promises that were made, engagements that were taken,
finally were not implemented in practice.

‘We have to be sure the decisions 
taken by the Greek parliament will be implemented and will not be 
revised after a snap election.’

The British Conservative party’s 
leader in Europe said it was time for Greece to leave the single 
currency. Martin Callanan said: ‘Nobody believes that the latest package
will save Greece. Even if all the measures agreed on Sunday night are 
implemented – and that looks increasingly unlikely – then by 2020, 
Greece would still be in a worse position than Italy is now.’

The row overshadowed a decision by 
Greece’s conservative party leader Antonis Samaras, widely tipped as the
country’s next prime minister, to pledge in writing that he would stick
to an agreed austerity package.

Despite the move, it emerged that 
eurozone finance officials are examining ways of delaying the second 
Greek bailout because of doubts the austerity measures will be imposed.

Greece’s economy is in freefall – 
shrinking by 7 per cent in the final quarter of last year – and there 
are doubts whether it can ever emerge from its debt problems.

Greek anger with the way they believe Germany has taken over their economy is boiling over on the country's streets.

In
recent days, protesters have burned German flags and defaced the Bank 
of Greece's headquarters to make it look like the Bank of Berlin.

chancellor Angela Merkel has also been depicted in Nazi uniform on the 
front page of  right-wing newspaper Democracy above a headline alluding 
to Auschwitz.

The backlash has been provoked by 
Germany’s role in driving through painful measures to stop Greece's debt
crisis from spiralling even further out of control.

Greece believes the Germans keep changing the requirements needed to access a 130billion euro tranche of bailout funds.

This
week it was told it had to cut an extra 325million euros from its 
budget and a meeting, where it was due to be told it would receive the 
bailout cash, was cancelled at the last minute.

The
satirical protests, which have been followed with violent riots, 
compare the German government with the Nazis who occupied the country in
the Second World War.

Germany occupied Greece from 1941 to 
1944 and, despite the old West Germany helping in no small part to 
rebuild the conquered land's economy, relations have never really 
recovered.

In 1957 Greek 
authorities detained Maximilian Merten, the former German wartime 
military administrator of the northern city of Thessaloniki.

He was later tried for war crimes and sentenced to 25 years in prison.

But
he was quietly released soon after because, as archives opened in 1990 
revealed, the Greeks freed him in return for securing economic 
co-operation with West Germany.
