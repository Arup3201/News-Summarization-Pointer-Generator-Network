The sprawling rock stars, their glasses of wine, and the pink flamingo on the mantlepiece are long gone, but there's no mistaking this iconic Manchester sitting room.

Two decades after it featured on the cover of Oasis' first album, Definitely Maybe, the room is still instantly recognisable to anyone who came of age in the Britpop era.

Taken in guitarist Paul ‘Bonehead’ Arthurs’ house in 1994, the photograph helped the album, which includes the hits Supersonic and Live Forever, to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide.

The sitting room that launched Britpop: Liam Gallagher lay on the floor while Noel strummed his guitar on sofa

How it looks today: The sitting room in Jenny and John-Paul Hershey's house is little changed since 1994

Spot the difference: Despite a few cosmetic changes, the Hersheys' sitting room is still recognisable

And the picture, which shows a young Liam Gallagher lying on the wooden floor while his brother, Noel, plays guitar on the sofa, has since become an iconic image for music fans all over the world.

Today the Victorian townhouse, where Oasis filmed the music video for their single Shaker Maker in 1993, is home to a family with two young children, but the fabric of the room is little changed.

The wooden floorboards are still uncovered, and while the wooden mantlepiece has since been stripped of its paint, it is the same one the flamingo sat on in 1994, though the ornate fireplace was taken when Bonehead moved out.

The picture rails, original cornicing and even the shelves by the window are still there, although the small boxy television (showing the Clint Eastwood classic, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), has been replaced by a more modern, flatscreen version.

The walls are no longer pale yellow, having been repainted a more Noughties neutral shade, and the beige blinds have been replaced by long brown curtains, but the layout of the room remains the same, with a sofa opposite the fireplace and a seat in the bay window.

A framed picture of former Manchester City footballer, Rodney Marsh, which stood by the fireplace, is replaced by a flower pot today.  And there's no sign of the poster of composer Burt Bacharach, one of Noel's idols, which leant against the end of the sofa.

Home: The house in Didsbury, Manchester, was home to Oasis guitarist Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs and his sisters

The floorboards are still bare and the sofa's still opposite the fireplace, but there are toys in the living room now

The convex plastic mirror on the left-hand wall has gone, replaced by a smart rectangular mirror in a wooden frame, and the spot where Liam Gallagher lay on the floor is now covered by a blue rug.

And the globe light by the fire has gone, as has the pink flamingo, replaced by children's birthday cards and a watercolour on the wall.

Mother of two Jenny Hershey, 45, allowed the pictures to be taken of her home in the smart suburb of Didsbury to mark the 20th anniversary of the iconic album, which came out in August 1994.

A remastered, reissue version of the album called Definitely Maybe: Chasing The Sun Edition is due out in May.

But Mrs Hershey said she will not be buying a copy of the reissue of Definitely Maybe because neither she nor her husband, John-Paul, 48, are fans.

Rear of the house: Oasis filmed the video for their single, Shaker Maker, in the garden in 1993

Sightseers: Mrs Hershey says she's used to Oasis fans peering through the windows but doesn't mind them

She said: 'My husband John-Paul bought the house in 1999 from Bonehead’s sisters, then I moved in in 2003.

'When I first moved in neighbours said "Ooh, you’re moving in to the party house,’ because they remembered the days when Bonehead used to have the band round for practice sessions and parties.

'Unfortunately my husband and I aren’t Oasis fans, so we don’t fully appreciate how special the living room is to others, but we do have had friends and family asking if they can come round to have a photograph taken.'

The house is included in organised tours for Oasis fans, and the Hersheys are used to spotting sightseers peering into their sitting room.

Mrs Hershey, who works as an education consultant and has children aged four and five months, said: 'To us, it is just our family home but we often get groups of people standing at the gate trying to get a look at the living room.

'We think it’s cool really. They are always respectful and never come past the gate to have a look.

'When Bonehead moved out he took the stained glass windows and the fireplace with him - we wish he'd left them because they are so beautiful.'

She added: 'Once we were in the airport on our way home from America, and I noticed a picture of the Definitely Maybe album cover. It’s bizarre being able to see our living room pictured all over the world.'
