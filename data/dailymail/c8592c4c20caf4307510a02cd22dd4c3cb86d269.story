A search has started to find the cute couple who got engaged on Monday in the most romantic of ways.

Like a scene from a cheesy romantic comedy, California residents were transfixed on the blue sky across west Los Angeles thanks to a grand gesture marriage proposal that was written in the clouds.

The group of messages could be seen all the way from Beverly Hills to Santa Monica, spawning hundreds of Twitter and Instagram photos from well-wishers.

The first message read: 'FOREVER LOVE.'

Circle of love: This incredible Instagram photo shows hows the proposal played out across West Los Angeles on Monday afternoon. However the Twitter question of the day remains: Exactly who are the lucky couple?

The second said: 'LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY.'

For the lucky woman at the center of the grand gesture, one can imagine reading the first two messages not knowing they were for her ... until the third arrived

And saving best for last, the thirs beckoned: 'MARRY ME MICCO.'

And they say the city of love is Paris: The pristine Los Angeles was lit up on Monday afternoon with an extravagant marriage proposal

Shmaltzy? Maybe just a little. But not many can say they were proposed to via a sky-written message

Those staring at the sky watching the proposal were left wondering the outcome.

'I hope she said yes! Who wouldn't when he does THAT?' one Twitter user wrote.

However, within moments, the groom-to-be managed to get a message to the pilot.

All of a sudden the final message in the series came.

It read: 'MICCO SAID YES!'

Yay: The 'confirmation' was the last message to be scrawled

However the big question of Twittersphere that remained was: Who is Micco?

And who is the man willing to do this for her?

Skeptics were quick to question whether the proposal wasn't actually someone asking for a hand in marriage but start of some social media stunt.

Others such as Hollywood website Laist, said it set a very high precedent for L.A. locals thinking about prosing anytime soon.

'Future fiancees of L.A. are probably angrily rethinking their own marriage proposals right about now,' the blog said.
