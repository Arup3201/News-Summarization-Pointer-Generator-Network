An Arizona bobcat may have used up one of its nine lives after it survived getting stuck inside an oncoming car.

Arizona Game and Fish Department spokeswoman Lynda Lambert said Saturday the bobcat appears to have escaped any serious injuries and is awaiting evaluation by a veterinarian at an animal sanctuary in Scottsdale.

Officials say a couple driving in Scottsdale on Friday night hit the bobcat after it darted into their path.
