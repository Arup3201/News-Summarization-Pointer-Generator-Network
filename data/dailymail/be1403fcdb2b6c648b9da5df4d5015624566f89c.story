A millionaire gave £628,000 to a man who threatened to reveal he had sex with a rent boy, a court heard.

The married father of three made payments for nine years in a desperate attempt to stop the secret life of which he was ‘extremely ashamed’ becoming public.

He finally went to police last August after telling the truth to his wife because he was ‘nearing breaking point’ over the demands.

After eight years the married father-of-three finally told his lawyers and police last August about the alleged blackmail, Chelmsford Crown Court heard

Yesterday the man, whose name is 
protected by the court and is known only by the pseudonym ‘Barnaby’, 
told Chelmsford Crown Court that he was a ‘bloody fool’ for paying up.

The alleged blackmailer, Anthony 
Still, 52, from Clacton, Essex, denies a charge of making unwarranted 
demands for money between June 2003 and August last year.

A jury of 
seven men and five women heard that the man, who was chairman of a 
successful family company, contacted an escort agency in 2002 after 
reading an advert in Gay Times.

He was put in contact with a 19-year-old, and Barnaby paid him for sex around nine times. They also took drugs together.

Still is alleged to have started 
blackmailing Barnaby after the boy’s father employed the private 
investigation firm he worked for to look into his son, and he discovered
the relationship.

Barnaby told the court: ‘I know if he had asked at the first meeting for £100,000 I would have told him to go and jump.

‘But I just wanted the problem to go 
away, so I agreed to give the £35,000 that was demanded at the first 
meeting. After that it became a “drip by drip” process.’ Asked why he 
made the payments, Barnaby said: ‘In  order to protect myself and my 
family from exposure.’

Speaking quietly, he said he had been
led to believe by Still, who was using an alias, that the teenager’s 
father would go to the police and the Press unless he handed money over.

‘I did not want my family to read about what I am extremely ashamed of having done,’ he said.

‘I would think to myself, I have 
already paid so much out. If I paid another £10,000, hopefully that will
be it but if I don’t, all the money I have already spent will 
essentially have been wasted.’

He said he was forced to sell his 
stocks and shares from time to time to meet the blackmail demands, but 
his salary and income from his investments was ‘simply not enough to 
cover’ the sums of money involved.

Barnaby told the court he met the 
teenager after replying to an advert for an escort agency with an 
Ipswich telephone number in Gay Times.

A fee of £100 was agreed before  he received a phone call from the  rent boy.

Oliver Glasgow, prosecuting, said the
pair met three times in 2002, before the rent boy moved to London. In 
spring 2003, the rent boy told  Barnaby that he was living in Colchester
in a house that his parents had provided for him, and the two met about
six times there.

Barnaby and the rent boy stopped 
contact after he agreed to pay off a £2,000 drug debt owed by his friend
in August 2003, shortly before the blackmail began.

The businessman told the jury that 
only his wife and a handful of relatives are aware of his bisexuality, 
and that most of his family do not know about his relationship with the 
rent boy.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
