Manchester United and Barcelona’s summer transfer plans have suffered a blow after Atletico Madrid announced star midfielder Koke has signed a new five-year contract.

The 22-year-old, who was integral as Atletico won La Liga for the first time in nearly two decades and reached the Champions League final, will become one of the club’s top earners.

His contract will expire in 2019, with right-back Juanfran also signing a new four-year deal at the Vicente Calderon.

Koke, who is valued at £30million, has emerged as one of Europe’s top young midfielder in the past two seasons, with Barcelona and Manchester United heavily linked with a move for the Spain international.

Last month Spanish newspaper Sport reported that new Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is a huge admirer of the midfield maestro - who has often been compared to Xavi.

The publication added that Enrique tried to sign the Spain international when he was 19 during his stint as Roma boss in the 2011-12 season.

In an interview in March, Xavi hailed Koke as his successor in the national team.

'Koke is an extraordinary footballer,' Xavi was quoted as telling Atletico's club website.

'He has everything: talent, physical ability, he is a footballer of the present and the future.

'He has been marked out as the conductor of Spain's orchestra for the next 10 years.

'I have a special affection for him because we play in the same position and I think he is an extraordinary player,' he added.

Staying put: Juanfran has also signed a new deal at the Liga champions, which will expire in 2018
