The last few months have been no joke for injury-stricken Andy Carroll, but the West Ham striker forgot his troubles on the pitch with a trip to see some comedy.

Carroll and girlfriend Billi Mucklow took some time out to see Lee Evans at London’s O2 Arena on Thursday night and even had a picture taken with the fidgety funnyman after the show.

Mucklow clearly enjoyed herself as she posted the picture on her Instagram account with the message ‘Had such a fun night at Lee Evans last night my face still aches from laughing so much!’

Carroll has been a victim of a string of injuries and has struggled to get back to full form with West Ham

Carroll, though, has not started a game for West Ham this season and it has been rumoured that Newcastle could be interested in taking the striker back providing he agrees to lower his £85,000-a-week wage demands.

The London club's £15million record signing has endured a rotten string of injuries at Upton Park and suffered ankle ligament damage during a pre-season tour to New Zealand in July. 

The striker made just 12 Premier League starts for Sam Allardyce's team last season, scoring two goals.
