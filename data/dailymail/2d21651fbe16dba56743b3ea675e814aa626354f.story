Newcastle Falcons have signed Scotland international Jon Welsh on a two-year deal.

The loose head prop has agreed a summer switch from Glasgow Warriors ahead of the 2015-16 Aviva Premiership season.

Welsh was part of the Scotland squad which finished last in the RBS 6 Nations this year and scored a try against Wales in February before being ruled out for the rest of the tournament with a fractured hand.

The 28-year-old told the club's official site: 'Newcastle are a club with a big future and definitely want to go places and for me personally, it's the challenge of being able to come down and compete in the Premiership.

'I love Glasgow, I'm from here and all my family is here. This is my seventh season at the club and I think at 28, its good timing for change and to challenge myself in a new environment where the ambitions are high.'

Welsh made 106 starts for the Warriors after signing in 2008 and he has made four appearances for Scotland.

Falcons director of rugby Dean Richards added: 'Jon is a player who comes with a great pedigree and has been a key feature of a Warriors team that is a consistent force in the Pro 12 and one that will add further quality to our front row options.'

'He looked very sharp in the Six Nations and hopefully will add to his four caps to date by impressing out in a Falcons shirt.'
