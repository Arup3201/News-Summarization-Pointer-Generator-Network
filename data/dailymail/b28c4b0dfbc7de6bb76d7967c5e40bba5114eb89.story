It is extraordinary to me that, after Jos Buttler had graced Lord’s with a quite magnificent century, England captain Alastair Cook should dampen it all down by saying that he’s not ready for Test cricket. 

I would have no hesitation in throwing Buttler into the first Test at Lord’s next week.

This is yet another example of the sort of ‘Englishness’ I’ve seen time and time again where we concentrate on what someone cannot do rather than what they can. And what Buttler can do is absolutely fantastic.

Keeping tabs: Jos Buttler remains in the picture for England's Test series against Sri Lanka

Centurion: Buttler scored a stunning ton at Lord's

First choice: Sussex wicketkeeper Matt Prior

I once heard that Marcus Trescothick was not ready before he played Test cricket. And Michael Vaughan. And Ian Bell. And they didn’t do too badly when they were given their chance.

It was interesting to me that Peter Moores almost distanced himself from Cook’s comments and I sincerely hope that, if Matt Prior is not fit, England have the courage of their convictions and get Buttler into the team.

I will give you two examples of wicketkeepers who were far from the finished article when they were given their chance in Test cricket and went on to become the best their country have produced.

Sceptical: England captain Alastair Cook suggested that Buttler was not ready for Test cricket

Differing views: Peter Moores said Buttler remains in the picture for the Sri Lanka Test series

There were question marks over Rod Marsh and Adam Gilchrist when Australia first picked them but they were not concerned about their rough edges, only that they had the potential to be very special performers.

As does Buttler. So come on England. Let’s be brave. Let’s be different. Let’s pick Buttler.
