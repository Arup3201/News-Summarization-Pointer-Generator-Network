Chinese civilisation is traditionally said to have originated in central China, by the Yellow River, when the first Xia Dynasty ruled the region around 4,000 years ago.

But a separate, complex society may have originated around 2,400 years earlier in the north-east of the country and gradually spread south, a study has suggested. 

Until now the Hongshan culture had not been credited as being the source of Chinese civilisation because it was understood to have been a small, remote and self-contained culture miles away from the river.

Chinese culture and civilisation is traditionally said to have originated by the Yellow River (pictured) when the first Xia Dynasty ruled the region, but new research suggests a complex civilisation not only originated around 2,400 years earlier, it may have been rooted across Inner Mongolia instead

The first evidence of the Hongshan culture, including pottery and jade, was found in the Chifeng Shi region, north of Beijing.

The middle reaches of the Yellow River is often referred to as the ‘cradle of Chinese civilisation’, where the country’s complex culture began. 

The Hongshan culture predates the Xia Dynasty by 2,400 years.

But, it is not credited as being the source of civilisation because, until now, it was thought to have been a relatively small, remote culture miles away from the river.

In particular, the first evidence of the culture, including pottery and jade, was found in the Chifeng Shi region, north of Beijing. 

Hongshan is known for carved artefacts, jade dragons and clay figurines. 

The discovery of such artefacts in Hunshandake suggests the culture was more wide-reaching and complex than first thought. 

But researchers from the Institute of Geochemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences wanted to see if the culture spread more widely.

In an attempt to discover more about the little-known people, the team studied sediment and desert lands in Hunshandake, in Inner Mongolia.

The area is approximately 185 miles (300km) from where the first Hongshan discoveries were made and is part of China’s desert belt - a region of arid and sandy landscapes.

During the dig, archaeologists found evidence of Hongshan pottery and stone artefacts suggesting the region once housed a large population of Hongshan people.

This suggests the culture was far more wide-reaching than first thought, and may have been more complex.

The team also studied environmental changes over the past 10,000 years by analysing patterns and depressions in the sand dunes.

The team also studied environmental changes  in Hunshandake (illustrated) and found the area was once covered in rivers and lakes, making it ideal for the Hongshan people to live. However, when this water dried up the Hongshan people may have migrated and played a formative role in setting up Chinese civilisation

It discovered the area was once covered in rivers and lakes, between 5,000 and 9,000 years ago, and birch and spruce trees would have lined these waterways.

This would have made it an ideal environment for the Hongshan people to live.

However, this water dried up and the area became more arid around 4,200 years ago.

The experts speculate that this could have forced the Hongshan people to leave the area and migrate south towards the river, meaning they may have played a formative role in establishing Chinese civilisation.

‘For the first time to our knowledge we present a case of desertification mainly triggered by changes associated with climate change,’ explained the researchers.

‘Our research on the interactions in the Hunshandake suggests Chinese civilisation may be rooted in the marginal areas in the north, rather than in the middle reaches of the Yellow River.’

The study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

During a separate dig, Chinese archaeologists unearthed relics of musical instruments from a complex of tombs in Zaoyang city, Hubei.

A stringed instrument, known as a Se, and a frame to hold chime bells were among the items excavated from the grave site. 

The Se is said to be the earliest ever found in China and will help expert study the musical development from the Western Zhou Dynasty to the Warring States Period.

Chinese culture is said to have originated in reaches of the Yellow River

While Hongshan was believed to be a remote culture in north of the country

But researchers found evidence Hongshan spread wider than first thought

They also found evidence of rapid desertification in areas where they lived

This could have forced them to migrate south, meaning they could have played a formative role in the development of Chinese civilisation
