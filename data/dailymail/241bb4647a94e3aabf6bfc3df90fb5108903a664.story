Tragic: Private Cameron Laing, 20, who was expecting a baby boy, died after being crushed against a vehicle during a military exercise

A young soldier who died after being crushed against a vehicle during a military exercise on Dartmoor was about to become a parent, his devastated family have revealed.

Private Cameron Laing, 20, was struck by an uncoupled trailer and pinned against its towing vehicle at Bracken Tor youth hostel near Okehampton, Devon, on Tuesday evening. 

He suffered a traumatic head injury and a cardiac arrest, and was later pronounced dead by paramedics. 

Now, tributes have been paid to Pte Laing, from Nottingham, who served with 7 Theatre Logistic Regiment Royal Logistic Corps.

In a statement, the soldier's family revealed he and his partner were expecting a baby boy, whom they had already named Cameron.

They said: 'Cameron was an amazing son, brother, boyfriend and expectant father.

'He was a loveable rogue, always playing practical jokes and the fun in any situation. He couldnâ€™t wait to be a father to his son, baby Cameron.

'He will be sorely missed by everyone whose life he touched.'

Pte Laing was pinned against the towing vehicle after being struck by the trailer as it travelled as part of a
 small convoy towards a battle camp at Okehampton.

Paramedics arrived at the hostel and performed CPR on the soldier, before declaring 
him dead at around 9.45pm.

Devon and Cornwall Police said an investigation into the accident was ongoing.

small convoy heading towards Okehampton battle camp.

'Local
 officers, including CID and the serious collisions investigation unit, 
attended the scene and began an investigation whilst in consultation 
with military personnel. The Health and Safety Executive has been informed.'

Lieutenant
 Colonel Ian Poole, commanding officer of 7 Theatre Logistic Regiment, 
today paid tribute to Pte Laing, whom he described as one of the 
regiment's 'rising stars'.

'Pte
 Laing was a bright, engaging and highly respected young soldier,' he said.

'Always
 ready to help others and never one to complain, in the relatively short
 time he was with the regiment he had earned himself a reputation as a 
soldier who always gave of his best. 

'A true character, we are much poorer today with his passing. His loss at such a young age is truly tragic. 

'Our thoughts are very much with his family and loved ones at this most difficult of times.'
