It's certainly not a case of everybody singing from the same hymn sheet.

A choir has been sacked by a vicar after refusing to undergo criminal  record checks.

The choristers have been singing together for years, but Father James Baker told them they had to be assessed by the Criminal Records Bureau.

Not singing any more: Wendy Warr, Sandra Woodward and Jenny Hansford alongside Father James Baker. The choir members have been sacked because they refused to undergo CRB checks

When two members in their 80s, who have more than 100 years of church singing experience between them, refused, they were apparently sacked in front of the congregation.

The vicar then sent an email to the remaining seven members saying that they should ‘step down’.

Father Baker, 40, is officially said to be ‘re-examining’ the kind of music enjoyed by the 70-strong congregation St Michael and All Angels Church.

He is said to be keen to introduce less  traditional sounds, including French  meditative chanting.

But his intervention has sparked fury at the 19th century church in Yeovil, Somerset.

The former psychiatric nurse, who joined the church in 2010, enjoys extreme sports including sky-diving, swimming with sharks and ‘Zorbing’, which involves rolling down a hill inside a large inflatable ball.

Row: Father James Baker allegedly sacked two elderly choir members who had together been singing for a combined total of more than 100 years after they refused to undergo CRB checks

He once raised money for church funds by diving into a shark-infested pool in a wetsuit complete with dog collar.

And he describes music as one  of his favourite pastimes, as well  as ‘a bad game of golf’ and  home brewing.

He handed the choir the  CRB forms after a Sunday service in January, wrongly believing that anyone involved with the church had to be assessed.

Former musical director Jenny Hansford said: ‘Two elderly gentlemen said they didn’t need to. They went to speak to the vicar in front of the congregation and he just said, “I am sorry but you are sacked from the choir then”.

The church insisted the choir quit in a row over introducing Taize meditative chanting.

The Taize Community is a modern movement in northern France, founded only in 1940.

The community of 100 Catholic and Protestant Monks is visited by thousands of pilgrims every year.

Songs take the form of short meditative chants which are repeated over and over. Many British churches have adopted the chants.

‘They are both distraught. They are wonderfully talented and aged 83, they have both been in the choir for their whole lives. We were absolutely shocked.’

Mrs Hansford, who is also the organist at the church, said Father Baker then decided to axe the choir entirely due to the ‘tensions’.

He wrote in an email: ‘The Church wardens and I regrettably feel that it would be appropriate at this time for the choir to temporarily step down with immediate effect.’ When the remaining members of the choir turned up to sing the following Sunday, they were told to sit in the congregation area.

Mrs Hansford, a grandmother-of-six from Marnhull, Dorset, resigned from her post on February 22 after the vicar failed to reassure her that the choir would be reinstated.

She said the choristers, who include her husband Michael, 72, a retired engineer, were now searching for other churches to sing in.

She added: ‘We are a tiny little choir, just nine adult members. We were supposed to have two children join us but the vicar dismissed us before they got their robes.

‘It is heartbreaking because they were so excited.’

Father Baker’s demand for CRB checks is not thought to be related to the children’s arrival.

Yesterday the Diocese of Bath and Wells confirmed all the choir members had been asked to stand down.

But a spokesman said choir members were already in a ‘cooling off period’ because some had resisted Father Baker’s ‘modern’ ideas. The vicar had planned to introduce Taize chanting, from a Christian community in France.

The spokesman said: ‘The church are re-examining all of the music in services and the choir has been asked to stand down as this goes on. The CRB checks were a misunderstanding, which the vicar has apologised for. He thought that all members of the choir needed a CRB check which they didn’t.

‘I don’t know whether he immediately sacked the two members on the spot but it doesn’t seem the sort of thing a vicar would do.’

Father Baker, a married father of two, was not available for comment yesterday.

A Criminal Records Bureau spokesman said: ’Criminal records checks can only be requested for specified positions or people in positions of responsibility where they supervise or work closely with children and/or vulnerable people.

‘This would not be the case for a position of simply singing in a church choir.’
