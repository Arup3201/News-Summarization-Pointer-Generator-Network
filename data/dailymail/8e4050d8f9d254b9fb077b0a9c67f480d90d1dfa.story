When you're spending $46 million on a house that measures at a total of 23,000 square feet -  roughly one third the area of the White House - the last thing you want to think about is filling the joint with furniture.

So in a growing trend among the rich and famously wealthy, multi-million dollar homes are being sold with all of their belongings, from the linens and lamps, to the artwork on the walls and sculptures in the yards.

Known as turn-key properties, it allows the buyer the convenience to pay and walk straight in to their new abode.

Such was the case for a sensation estate that recently sold in Bel-Air, which was previously owned by country singer Kenny Rogers.

First built in 1938, the 11-bedroom chateau includes a glass elevator, a ballroom, three living rooms and a 3,000-square-foot master suite, according to The Los Angeles Times.
