Theft: Mark Cos has allegedly stolen underwear from Emma Pinches home

A police officer's son with an underwear fetish broke into a woman's house to steal her knickers, a court heard.

Mark Cox, 22, pocketed a set of house keys belonging to former school pal Emma Pinches, 21, after going to a party at her home in February.

The hospital porter then used the keys to let himself in to the property while Emma was out - to steal her underwear.

Magistrates heard she became suspicious when items of lingerie started to go missing over the next few weeks.

Prosecuting Julie Costello said: 'The day after the party the victim noticed a set of house keys were missing.

'Over the next few days she started to notice that items of her underwear were going missing.'

Emma suspected Cox may be responsible when she received a text from him in March to ask whether she would be out with her boyfriend that evening.

Police then searched Cox's home and found a large quantity of women's underwear.

When asked why he had a large sized bra he told them it was because he was a 'large size'

Officers also discovered CS gas spray as well as a police helmet, handcuffs, jacket and stab vest in his bedroom.

Cox claimed he had bought the police uniform items off eBay to use for kinky role-playing sex romps with his ex-girlfriend.

Victim: Emma Pinches was a former school friend of mark and had her underwear stolen

Suspicious: Emma thought Mark might be responsible when she received a text from him asking her if she would be going out with her boyfriend that night

At Northampton Magistrates Court Cox pleaded guilty to two counts of burglary, one count of possessing a weapon designed for the discharge of CS gas and possessing a police uniform.

Defending Alistair Evans revealed his client had taken the items at a time when he was being 'driven by a fetish' for women's underwear.

He said his client had bought the police uniform as 'memorabilia' because his father and grandfather were both police officers.

Underwear: Defence said that the actions were driven by a fetish but that he had not vandalised the property

He added: 'He accepts he had taken the items of underwear from the victim's house but there was no element of vandalism and he had caused no form of damage to the woman's house.

'The CS spray was bought from a garage in France.

'It has never been used.'

The court was told Cox has since undergone counselling in a bid to overcome his underwear addiction.

He will be sentenced at Northampton Crown Court next month.
