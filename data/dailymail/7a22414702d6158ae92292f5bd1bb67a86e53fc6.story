A 6-year-old boy who spent more than three hours underground after being swallowed by a massive Indiana sand dune was able to respond to 'simple commands' after being flown to a Chicago hospital.

Nathan Reul, who is six, was 
rescued after falling into a sinkhole that opened up at Indiana Dunes 
National Lakeshore, trapping him for more than three hours under 11 feet
of sand.

Nathan, whose survival was described as a 'miracle' by a local coroner, remains in critical condition Saturday at Comer Children's Hospital and has responded well to being on a ventilator, hospital spokeswoman Lorna Wong said in a statement.

Lakeshore Ranger 
Bruce Rowe said work crews had to use heavy excavating equipment to pull
the little boy out of a dune known as Mount Baldy, where he was playing Friday
afternoon.Â 

Rescue effort: Michigan City firefighters, police, and first responders dig through a sand dune at Mount Baldy near Michigan City, Ind., while searching for a missing 6-year-old-boy who fell into a hole

Heavy-duty: Two local excavating companies joined in the dig, providing backhoes and other equipment

The incident happened on a sand dune measuring 126 feet known as Mount Baldy at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore

Wong later told The Associated Press she could not say if the responses were an indication that he had regained consciousness.

Michigan City, Ind., Fire Chief Ronnie Martin told WSBT-TV on Saturday that an air pocket saved the boy's life.

According
to Bruce Rowe, a ranger at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore park 
along Lake Michigan, the boy's family said he was playing on the dune 
Friday when he dropped partially into it.

The 6-year-old was walking with his 
parents along the sand dunes in Michigan City when he came across a 
rotted tree that may have caused the collapse,

'Miracle': It took crews using heavy excavating equipment more than three hours to pull the boy out from under 11 feet of sand

While they were trying to dig him out, the dune collapsed, burying the boy under 11 feet of sand, he said.

The
family called 911, and emergency responders were on the scene within 15
minutes and began digging by hand, Rowe said. Crews with excavating 
equipment were brought in to aid the rescue effort.

Martin
told the South Bend, Ind.-area TV station that firefighters located the
boy while prodding the dune, right after they detected the air pocket 
that enabled him to survive for so long underground.

They pulled him out and the boy was rushed to a Michigan City hospital, then later flown to Comer.

LaPorte County Deputy Coroner Mark Huffman told The News-Dispatch of Michigan City that the boy's survival was a 'miracle.'

'It is totally amazing,' he said.

Authorities were puzzled about the cause of the collapse, which Rowe called 'unprecedented.'

The
section of the dune, which is more than 125 feet high and is known as 
Mount Baldy, had been cordoned off for restoration work.

Lucky to be alive: Rescuers were able to find the boy in an air pocket and pull him to safety

Signs of life: On the way to the hospital, Nathan who is six, began to breathe and cry

It will remain closed at least through the weekend and until authorities can determine if it's still a danger.

Wong,
the Comer spokeswoman, said the boy's family wanted to express is 
gratitude to the emergency responders and everyone else who helped in 
his rescue.

'They also ask that people include this little boy in their prayers,' she said.

During a press conference Saturday afternoon, Laporte County Chief Deputy Coroner Mark Huffman told ABC News that the 6-year-old had ingested sand, and he will likely undergo extensive therapy to rehabilitate his lungs.
