Pictures of unidentified dead bodies will be posted online for the first time - allowing the families of missing people to search for their loves ones, it has emerged.

The Missing Persons Bureau currently 
holds records of around 1,000 people who have not been identified, some 
dating back to the 1950s.

The bureau has now launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals.

Tragic: Pictures of unidentified dead bodies will be posted online for the first time - allowing the families of missing people to search for their loves ones. This picture shows the tattoos on the arm of a man found collapsed in a north London street in 2007

Unidentified: The man on the left died after he was hit by a train in Hertfordshire in 1995. This man, right, was found lying in a makeshift tent adjacent to the A1 in Bedfordshire in 1997. Both have never been identified

It will feature pictures of bodies, but any images deemed to be distressing will be marked with a warning and require confirmation before viewing.

They include a photograph of the arm 
of one body found collapsed in Islington, north London in 2007, easily 
recognisable by the distinctive tattoos of panther and red Indian on his
right forearm.

Many of the bodies have washed up on beaches, unrecognisable as a 
result of being exposed to the elements, or have been discovered on 
railway lines.

Some
250 people die on the UK's railways every year, most as a result of 
suicide, according to British Transport police, and a significant number
of these bodies are never identified.

Trying to find matches for the corpses against the list of the
missing is also very time-consuming.

Unidentified: This computer-generated image is of a man found floating in the River Lea, near Newham, while the man on the left was found washed up on a riverbank on the River Avon

Search: The bureau has launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals. This shoe belonged to a man who was found in 2003 in the sea, near St. Margaret's Island, Wales

Help needed: This clothing belonged to an oriental man found in the River Thames near HMS Belfast in 1989

By law, local councils must cremate or bury unidentified corpses, to 
avoid the risk of disease.

This makes identification far more 
difficult: cremation destroys DNA, while to exhume a buried body,
police must seek the approval of a coroner before any further 
investigation can be carried out.

The graves
are often marked with wooden plaques stating 'unknown male' or 'unknown
female'.

The Missing Persons Bureau published a
report on the number of missing persons and unidentified bodies in 
Britain based on figures provided by forces across the country on the 
number of missing person incidents reportedÂ in 2010/11.

The bureau are a total of around 1,000 unidentified cases which remain unidentified.

Just six per cent of those involve 
living people, most of whom have been found without identification and 
suffer from a form of memory loss or dementia.

The vast majority of cases - 83 per 
cent - the bureau is desperate to solve involve dead bodies while there 
are still more than 100 unidentified body parts (11 per cent) sitting in
police morgues across Britain waiting to be identified.

with a small 
number of body parts (11 per cent) and unidentified alive people (6 per cent) also still
awaiting identification.

Joe Apps, from the Bureau, said: 'The
aim of the new site is to bring closure to the families and friends of 
the people featured.

'With new unidentified person cases 
we rely on modern forensic techniques for identification but on older 
cases we look to use every tool available and believe that case 
publicity is the best chance of getting images recognised.

'This will be the first time families of missing people have been able to search through records for themselves and it will empower families to play an active part in the search for their loved ones.'

Members of the public will be able to search the cases and provide information online.

Any relevant details will then be passed to the police or the coroner in charge of the case.

Details of all unidentified cases, including bodies, remains and living people, will be posted on the website - apart from cases where remains are too partial to be of value.

The site: The bureau has now launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals

The bureau was unable to give any details of individual cases - other that the ones highlighted here - but a spokesperson said the website had already been significantly slowed due to the amount of traffic it has already received.

The UK Missing Persons Bureau continually work with police forces and the public to try to put a name to these individuals, to enable them to be put at rest and to provide closure for their family and friends.

The Bureau is also running a special project, called Operation Kharon, providing resources to assist police forces to identify their outstanding unidentified people, bodies and body part cases.

Similar websites have been set up in certain states in the U.S, and by police in Belgium and Switzerland.

The Missing Persons Bureau is part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency.
