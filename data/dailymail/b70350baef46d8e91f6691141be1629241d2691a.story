The slow growth in wages in Britain may be the result of people being reluctant to leave their secure jobs, The Bank of England is expected to report this week.

Economists believe workers are not seeing the benefits of higher starting wages as they are too scared to abandon employment they see as being safe.

It comes after a survey revealed British firms expect average wage rises to track inflation and remain weak for at least another year.

Research by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) suggested the Bank of England may be forced to hold off on any interest rate rise until as late as next summer.

Official data showed regular pay for employees grew by 0.7 per cent in the three months to May, according to the Office for National Statistics.

That was less than half the rate of inflation and the slowest growth in regular pay since records began in 2001.

According to The Daily Telegraph, in the last three months of 2013, just 0.75 per cent of those in work resigned to move jobs – half the figure recorded in December 2007.

Martin Beck, a senior economic adviser to the Ernst & Young, told the newspaper: ‘The improving economy should give employees more confidence to look for better job opportunities, rather than sticking with the status quo.

‘This may trigger some upward movement in pay growth as employers seek to discourage experienced staff from moving by offering them more money.’

The CIPD undertook a survey of personnel managers which found most private sector employers expect average wage rises in the year to June 2015 to be in the region of two per cent. That represents a slight fall from the previous year, when average wages were expected to rise by 2.5 per cent, it said.

The Bank of England is concerned about raising rates while pay struggles to keep up with inflation.

It would also mean that average wage rises were only just keeping pace with consumer price inflation, which economists expect to be a touch below the Bank of England’s two per cent target rate until the middle of next year, meaning that in real terms wages are likely to have barely increased at all.

The latest UK labour market report will be released on Wednesday, at the same time as the Bank of England publishes its latest quarterly inflation outlook for the UK economy. 

The Bank's wage inflation forecasts are likely to be the main focus for attention as they are likely to give the best indication of when interest rates may begin to rise.

Bank governor Mark Carney has warned that average wages rises will be a significant factor in any decision to start raising interest rates from their current historic low of 0.5 per cent.
