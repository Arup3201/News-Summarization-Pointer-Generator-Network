A lesbian was sacked by her boss the morning after a party at his house, a tribunal has been told.

Rae Roberts, 19, went to Jim Cullen's house in Reading, Berkshire, with her partner, Jennifer Rowsell, who also worked for Cash Zone Ltd.

The next morning Miss Roberts was called into Mr Cullen's office where she was sacked and Miss Rowsell quit soon after in protest at her girlfriend's treatment.

Miss Roberts says Mr Cullen discriminated against her on grounds of her sexual orientation and claims that he threw a bin at her and called her an idiot.

She said that her boss made offensive comments about her sexuality and her age and that her immediate manager, Abigail Peters, would leave abusive and demeaning notes about her performance on a weekly basis.

Mr Cullen and Cash Zone Ltd deny any wrongdoing and claim Miss Roberts was dismissed because she failed to follow company procedures or take on board training.

In her statement, Miss Roberts described receiving regular written and verbal abuse from Mr Cullen and Miss Peters, who constantly criticised the amount of work she did and its standard.

She said she was criticised for being late and using Facebook despite claiming Miss Peters was sometimes several hours late and also used the website.

The panel heard that her responsibilities included dealing with money transfers, valuations, buy-back procedures, processing cheques, testing gold, serving customers and even cleaning the branch office in Camberley, Surrey.

She said: 'In September 2011 the second respondent (Mr Cullen) held a party at his home for all of the firm's employees. I and my partner Jennifer Rowsell attended the party.

'The next working day he came to the Camberley branch and said to me how disrespectful I was and how embarrassed he was of me because of how I and Jennifer Rowsell were "all over each other".

'I found his remark embarrassing, unfavourable and directed at my sexual orientation,' she told the tribunal sitting in Reading, Berkshire.

Dark-haired Miss Rowsell went further when she gave evidence later on, denying such activity had even take place.

She said: 'I never really display any affection publicly. I would not display affection, especially with work people around.'

Over the next few months, Miss Roberts said, the offensive notes continued with comments such as: 'You're a stroppy little teenager who has an attitude', 'I will depress you and ruin your holiday', as well as 'clean the f****** fridge' and 'clean the 'f****** microwave'.

Then on January 28 last year Mr Cullen held another party at his house, which Miss Roberts and Miss Rowsell reluctantly attended.

'At one point when I, Abigail Peters and other girls were dancing, the second respondent (Mr Cullen) said to me: 'Don't get excited about dancing with other women',' said Miss Roberts.

The tribunal heard that on March 30 last year Abigail Peters spilled some gold-testing acid onto her trousers.

She pointed to the inside of her upper-thigh, showing it to Mr Cullen. He then said: 'Be careful. You may get Rae excited.'

Rowan Morton, counsel for the respondents, said: 'Mr Cullen remembers, first of all, you were roaring with laughter and having a joke.'

Miss Roberts said: 'That's incorrect.'

A few days earlier, on March 23, Miss Roberts said she was called into Mr Cullen's office, where she said he shouted and swore at her for about 30 minutes, telling her: 'I bet you go home and cry to your mum, dad and Jennifer but they will not care or help you. You're a stupid kid.'

She said he then grabbed his half-full bin and shouted: 'This is how you empty a f****** bin' as he picked it up.

She began to leave the office after being told: 'Go on then,' and turned around just as the bin flew past her and smashed into the door.

Miss Rowsell, who had worked in the firm's Bracknell branch, testified that she had seen Mr Cullen shouting and swearing at her partner on up to 10 occasions.

She said Miss Roberts, who moved to the Camberley branch from Bracknell on July 18, 2011, had returned home in tears before and that she had encouraged her to look for other work and make a formal grievance but that Miss Roberts was sacked on April 16, 2012, before they could submit it.

The claimant, of Brook Road, Camberley, said Miss Peters had requested the abusive notes back and that the record of their contents, which the firm had presented to the tribunal, was wrong.

Miss Morton said Mr Cullen had never shouted at or sworn at the claimant but had always treated her with respect and supported her.

She also said the gay couple had stayed the night at his home during the first party and that the flat they lived in was rented from him.

The hearing continues.
