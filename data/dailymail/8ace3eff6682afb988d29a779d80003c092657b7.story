'Peter Pan Live' didn't exactly fly for NBC on Thursday night as just nine million viewers tuned in - less than half of the audience 'The Sound of Music' pulled in last year.

The Nielsen company reported this year's musical production, starring Allison Williams as Peter Pan and Christopher Walken as Captain Hook, reached 9.1 million viewers.

In comparison, 'The Sound of Music', which starred Carrie Underwood as Maria, reached 18.6 million viewers last year, compelling NBC to go back to work getting another musical on the air.

Despite its high ratings, some performances last year were slammed by critics - including Underwood, who panned for her 'amateur' acting and Stephen Moyer, as Captain Georg Von Trapp, who was written off for 'clenched' singing.

This year's performance attracted fewer viewers than a repeat of a 'Big Bang Theory' episode, which was watched by 10.7 million people during the first half-hour of 'Peter Pan Live'.

They missed Williams, 26, enduring a wobbly start to the production as she almost crashed into a wall while attempting to impress Wendy with his magical flying powers. 

But the actress, who is better known for playing Marnie in the hit show Girls, recovered quickly, cushioning herself against the wall with her hand and shook off the minor mishap.

The three-hour production also starred Christopher Walken as a charismatic Captain Hook - complete with tap-dancing and his inimitable swagger.

But he was not without his mishaps either, as it appeared he was lip syncing some of the songs, while Gawker accused the whole cast of taking the fun out of the children's classic.

Despite the low number of viewers, it appeared to be a hit among many who did tune in, with Today anchor Savannah Guthrie quipping on Friday: 'It was not Peter Pan-ned. 

Star performance: The 26-year-old Girls star received high praise from viewers on social media for her role as the 'boy who wouldn't grow up' in Thursday night's live show on NBC

We're Hooked: Veteran star Christopher Walken showed off tap-dancing skills with his band of pirates as Peter Pan's arch nemesis Captain Hook 

On Twitter, one viewer, @joey_aulisio, wrote: 'Allison Williams killed it. Walken killed it. That wooden gator killed it. Tiger Lily - call me. THAT DOG! Great job everyone.'

Another, @ryansatin, wrote: 'If you're not watching Walken as Hook, you are missing out on a truly special moment in TV history.'   

Girls co-star Lena Dunham tweeted: 'Allison is about to undertake one of the greatest drag roles in history and we are so proud we could burst. She will slay.' 

Celebrity fans also offered their support. Katy Perry tweeted: 'I believe in you Allison Williams!'

Zach Braff joked: 'Brian Williams is crushing this.' 

The NBC Nightly News host - the father of Allison Williams - took the night off anchoring duties to watch his daughter's performance from the wings.

Mr Williams told TVNewser: 'We will be watching the broadcast - immediate family only - sequestered in an undisclosed location... close enough to the production as to burst through the stage door the moment the credits roll.'

However there were grumbles from viewers, as one Twitter user, @KittyKateMD, wrote: 'Although Allison Williams is singing beautiful, but her English accent is horrible! #PeterPanLive'.

Another fired back: 'Chill with the hate people. Just be thankful its not as awful as Carrie Underwood in The Sound Of Music #PeterPanLive'. 

Mia Farrow tweeted: 'Christopher Walken = Gold, no matter what.' But she added: 'Weird that the 'lost boys' are grown men.'

Like The Sound Of Music, Peter Pan Live! wisely leaned on Broadway performers, including five-time Tony Award-nominee Kelli O'Hara, who was sadly underused, as Mrs Darling. 

The show also starred Jake Lucas (who was in Broadway show Newsies) as John Darling and a very good Taylor Louderman (Bring It On: The Musical) as Wendy.

The beefy-armed Christian Borle, a Tony winner and veteran of last year's The Sound of Music Live!, played Mr Darling. (In a twist, Borle won his Tony playing Captain Hook in the Peter Pan play Peter and the Starcatcher.)  

Wendy Darling sings a romantic song expressing her unrequited love for Peter Pan in a performance which stayed true to JM Barrie's classic novel 

Christopher Walken's Captain Hook character delighted viewers with his drawling dialogue and dancing 

Borle, who also stars in NBC’s Smash, played two characters - the children’s strict dad Mr Darling as well as Hook’s right-hand pirate, Smee, a character he was far more successful at playing.

But one of the stand-out performances came from the show’s second biggest star, Minnie Driver, despite only being seen onscreen for the last five minutes.

Despite being the first voice we heard as the narrator throughout, Minnie came out at the very end to play Wendy Darling after she was all grown up - a mother who was still longing for Peter Pan’s return.

Wendy's emotional moment at the end as Peter Pan finally returns - and she allows her daughter to follow him to Neverland - was one which moved many fans to tears.

It was also a more culturally sensitive Peter Pan, with Alanna Saunders, a 22-year-old woman of Cherokee descent, portraying the Native American princess character Tiger Lily, and the offensive song Ugg-a-Wugg transformed into True Blood Brothers.  

However the biggest reaction went to a rather unexpected cast member - a crazy bright purple-and-blue crocodile, who tormenting Captain Hook and his pirates throughout. 

'And the blue crocodile just broke Twitter,’ viewer Zach Brooks tweeted.  

Allison Williams' Girls co-star Lena Dunham tweeted: 'Allison is about to undertake one of the greatest drag roles in history and we are so proud we could burst. She will slay.'

Katy Perry: 'I believe in you Allison Williams!'

Zach Braff joked: 'Brian Williams is crushing this.'

Mia Farrow tweeted: 'Christopher Walken = Gold, no matter what.' 

Anna Kendrick went on stream of tweets as she watched. She posted: 'Dog is already the only character I care about #PeterPanLive.

'Tinkerbell sounds just like the iPhone alarm and these kids are still asleep? I don't buy it. #PeterPanLive'

'OH s***!!! Neverland is an acid trip and I never want get sober. #PeterPanLive' 

Sarah Silverman: 'There are only two women in #PeterPanLive and they're both Christopher Walken'

Sarah Michelle Gellar: 'I wonder what next years live musical will be?? I'm hoping for @MariahCarey in #HelloDolly. Anyone else have any ideas?

Aubrey Plaza: 'CHRISTOPHER WALKEN IS EVERYTHING' 

Judd Apatow: '@billyeichner: .@BillCosby u watchin Peter Pan?” He is more of a Sleeping Beauty guy. Isn't it odd to think he is sitting with someone now'
