University lecturer Rebecca is staggering under the weight of her over-flowing shopping basket.

Peeking out are packets of fresh gnocchi and tagliatelle, Scottish mussels, crayfish tails, wafer-thin Parma ham, slabs of holey Emmental cheese and a bottle of Prosecco.

With a sleek blowdry and cut-glass vowels, the 40-year-old is middle class from the top of her head to the tips of her pedicured toes.

Lidl and Aldi were once names to be avoided, but have won over leagues of middle class shoppers by stocking items such as prosciutto and Parmesan for knock-down prices (file pic)

She is exactly the sort of shopper one sees wandering the spacious aisles of Waitrose. (Indeed she’s carrying a Waitrose bag for life).

Yet she is queuing for the till at discount supermarket Lidl in Clapham Junction, south London.

There is a slight hiccup when she is told the store doesn’t accept credit cards, but she seems unruffled, selects another card from her purse, and positively skips out of the door.

What is happening here? There was a time when the middle classes would rather starve than be seen in a discount supermarket.

To show one’s face at Netto, the Danish cut-price superstore with the garish yellow-and-black logo that launched 200 stores in Britain in the Nineties, was social suicide.

Yet something has changed.

Figures this week revealed that the combined sales of Lidl and Aldi are likely to overtake those of Morrisons — a rise driven by middle-class shoppers deserting the likes of Sainsbury’s, Tesco and even Waitrose, for the discount chains.

Lidl now has more than 600 shops in the UK, and Aldi more than 500. Aldi expects to generate record sales of £7 billion this year, while Lidl UK expects to enjoy a similar turnover.

And the secret to their seduction of the mid-market shopper?

They have undercut British supermarkets on the luxury goods middle-class shoppers can’t bring themselves to go without.

When British shoppers fell in love with Mediterranean food, from the Seventies onwards, all the supermarkets fell over themselves to stock it.

They saw an opportunity to sell Parmesan cheese and such like as ‘deli’ foods, and made shoppers pay through the nose for them.

Aldi and Lidl have cottoned on to middle class values, promoting affordable win and dinner-part show-stoppers at bargain prices

Meanwhile, in Germany, Aldi and Lidl were sourcing foods that are seen as everyday items in the countries where they originated, for example ham from Parma and the Black Forest, gouda from Holland, Brie de Meaux from France, and ice cream from Italy.

As staples, they were priced reasonably, and the shops flourished, expanding across Europe to Britain.

The realisation over the past few years that Aldi and Lidl sell similar foods to Waitrose and Sainsbury’s, but at the price enjoyed by shoppers in France, Holland, Belgium, Italy and Portugal, has sent British shoppers flocking to their stores.

But the rise of cut-price shops hasn’t happened overnight.

Ever since 2008’s financial crash, the chat at dinner parties has been less about where everyone will be going skiing and more about that great bottle of extra virgin olive oil from Aldi.

‘So cheap, you’d never know,’ boasted one friend, soon after her conversion to bargain-basement shopping.

Low-cost supermarkets are also thriving because we have lost faith in leviathans such as Tesco. Shoppers are tired of expensive advertising campaigns and BOGOF labels that only mean we end up with more than we can chew — and wasting a shameful amount of food.

The opening of Aldi and Lidl stores now attract queues of people waiting to get inside first

The sight of a superstore stuffed with thousands of lines feels decadent, while Lidl and Aldi, with their smallish buildings and modest ranges — Aldi and Lidl stock between 1,000 and 3,000 lines, compared with more than 50,000 at a superstore — seem positively intimate.

For cash and time-strapped middle-class shoppers, this simplicity is appealing.

Shrewdly, Aldi and Lidl have since cottoned on to other British middle-class values, producing dinner-party show-stoppers at bargain prices.

The fashionable steak of the moment is Wagyu, a Japanese method of producing tender, fat-marbled beef involving feeding the cattle with beer and massaging its rump.

The meat is famously decadent, but Aldi sell Wagyu beef Sirloin Steaks for just £6.69.

Locally sourced produce has become fashionable with the middle classes in recent years, and again Aldi and Lidl were quick to catch on.

For Christmas 2012, Aldi launched the Roly Poly  free-range bronze turkey, reared near the ancient Thetford Forest, which straddles Suffolk and Norfolk, in portable sheds with access to grassy fields.

At £37.99 per turkey, Aldi undercut the competition by £10 and produced something of equal standard to Waitrose and Sainsbury’s. The rest of the year, Lidl sell whole free-range chickens for £5 each.

Both chains are also brilliant at capitalising on short-lived trends.

In this sport-obsessed summer, with the Tour de France in Britain, Wimbledon and the World Cup all on our screens, Lidl launched a limited range of high-end bikes and cycling equipment at discount prices.

Aldi launched a £65 GPS watch in June that measures your heartbeat and tells you where you are — as well as what time it is.

No wonder Tesco is having a crisis of confidence. Aldi and Lidl are tapping into the interests and tastes of shoppers almost effortlessly, while the giant retailer throws them 10,000 lines and get barely a bite.

And the best thing about Aldi and Lidl? They are taking the snobbery out of grocery shopping, selling delicious foods at the price paid in European supermarkets and not marking them up as luxuries for the rich.

Cheers — or Prost! as our German friends would say — to that!
