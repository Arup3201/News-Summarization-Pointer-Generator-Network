A father is preparing to kiss his newborn baby for the first time after he went the whole of 2012 without shaving.

Dave Phillips, 27, took part in last year's Movember, but thought one month without shaving was too easy.

So the warehouse worker took facial hair growing to the next level by not shaving for a whole year.

Dave is now preparing to have his first shave in a year and give his 14-week-old daughter Lyla her first smooth kiss from daddy.

The father-of-two has been agonisingly scratching his face for months after shaving all his hair and stubble off on New Year's Eve 2011.

He said: 'I shaved everything off on New Year's Eve and now I'm looking pretty different. It is coming off on New Year's Day.

'I'm in a right old state at the moment but I am managing to get myself through. I'm not overly in a good place but I'm still happy.

'Everyone has been taking the mick but I've just had to get on with it. It is just a beard at the end of the day and my hair is about seven inches long.

'My fiance Lauren had our second child in September and I haven't been able to kiss my newborn baby. That's one of the first things I will do when I shave.

'Lauren has been great but I haven't had many kisses off her recently.

'As I work at a warehouse, I see people from all over the country and have got loads of good reactions off them.

'Everyone has been taking the mick but I've just had to get on with it. It is just a beard at the end of the day and my hair is about seven inches long.'

Found Movember too easy: Mr Phillips has raised more than £1,000 for the armed forces charity

Not long to go now: The father-of-two has been agonisingly itching his face for months after shaving all his hairy and stubble off on New Year's Eve 2011

Dave, from Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, has raised more than £1,000 for the armed forces charity.

He added: 'I decided to do it for Help 4 Heroes as I have friends and family in the forces and I used to be in the Territorial Army.

'Last year I did Movember but I thought it was too easy so I decided to go a step further and go a whole year without shaving or cutting my hair.

'I don't know the people being helped by Help for Heroes but I wanted to give something back to them at the end of the day.

'I appreciate the sacrifice they have made for us at the end of the day.'
