'Leo is really happy at our club,' Bartomeu told 8TV. 'His father has told me so, although [Leo] has been under great deal of pressure off the pitch.

'[But] he hasn’t asked us for a new contract renewal. He’s happy.

'We always help the players at this club and [former coach Pep] Guardiola also said the same a few years ago.'

Bartomeu also backed Messi to win this year's Ballon d'Or award by stating 'he's the No 1'.

He added: 'They’re more concerned with him vomiting than his records.

'They want to beat him off the pitch, on the pitch he’s the No 1.'

The Argentina international was in action at Old Trafford on Tuesday night where his side lost 1-0 to Portugal
