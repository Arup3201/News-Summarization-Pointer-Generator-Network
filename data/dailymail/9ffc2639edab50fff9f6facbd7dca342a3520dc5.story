'The way I saw it, I didn't have a choice. This is what I was put here to do,' the young man told CNN of his decision to travel to Beirut and help Syrian refugees fleeing to Lebanon.

He then added, 'I guess I am just a hopeless romantic, and I am an idealist, and I believe in hopeless causes.'

A member of the U.S. Army Rangers, he was deployed to Iraq in 2007 and honorably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour.

After returning home however, and studying political science at Butler University in Indiana, something felt off the Kassig.

'I was going to school with kids who look the same, were the same age as me, but we weren't the same,' he said. 

'I wanted more of a challenge, a sense of purpose.'

'I am not a doctor. I am not a nurse,' he said in the interview. 

'But I am a guy who can clean up bandages, help clean up patients, swap out bandages, help run IVs, make people's quality of life a little bit better. This is something for me that has meaning, that has purpose.'

He also founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance) around this time, a medically-oriented emergency relief organization that serves refugee populations and internally displaced persons.

It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, when he was detained by members of ISIS as he headed to to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria.
