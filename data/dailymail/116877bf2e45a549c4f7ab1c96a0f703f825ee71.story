An estimated two billion people around the world saw Jamaica's Usain Bolt thrash his rivals to win gold in the men's 100m final - but none of them were in the U.S., as NBC declined to broadcast the historic moment live.

Bolt sailed through the semi-finals before successfully defending his Olympic title - against a field that included three Americans - at 4.50pm EDT.

But, not for the first time this Games, NBC took the controversial decision to hold off broadcasting the hugely popular event until prime time, leaving millions of track and field fans outraged.

Fans desperate to see the 25-year-old set the track on fire again, four years after his superb performance in Beijing, took to Twitter to vent their anger, using the hashtag #NBCfails.

'How can NBC be so inept? How many senior execs will be canned? How high will the cleaning go? It'll probably be delayed,' one user tweeted.

Another wrote: 'Thank you NBC for showing Bolt winning the 100 meter finals instead of woman vollyball (sic) and horses. wait you didn't.'

'Would have been nice if NBC chose to broadcast it live. NBC really values its audience,' a fellow track fan tweeted.

In an Olympic record time of 9.63 seconds, Bolt sensationally defended his coveted title as the fastest man on the planet.

A global TV audience estimated at up 
to two billion watched the Jamaican retain his 100-metre 
sprint crown but Americans weren't among them.

An audience of 20 million people watched Usain Bolt win gold in the men’s 100m final, according to BBC figures.

Overnight ratings showed 19.4 
million tuned in to BBC1 to see the race, with another 600,000 watching 
via the red button service.

The BBC’s Olympics boss, Roger Mosey, said the figures were 'sensational'.

Last night’s audience was the 
biggest for the games so far, outstripping the 17.1 million who watched 
Mo Farah win the 10,000m on Saturday night.
    The games have consistently pulled 
in massive audiences for the BBC, with more than 16 million people 
watching Jessica Ennis triumph in the heptathlon and 15.6 million 
watching Greg Rutherford’s long jump gold.

Figures released by the corporation
 also show record numbers watching the coverage online with its website 
recording a peak audience of 8 million - above the previous record of 
5.7 million.

More than 1.5 million people have 
downloaded the BBC’s Olympics app for their phone and around 17 million 
people have used one of the 24 red button streams.

The website has seen 29 million 
requests for its interactive video streams with video of Bradley 
Wiggins’ win being the single most popular, with 729,000 requests.

Mr Mosey told followers on Twitter 
that Andy Murray’s victory over Roger Federer in the men’s singles was 
watched by 10.7 million people.

The race had been billed ‘the greatest’ race of London 2012 – and it was certainly the most anticipated.

The latest blunder comes after NBC's employees started turning on the network’s much-criticised Olympics coverage.

Dan Hicken, who has been the sports director of NBC affiliate 12 News in Jacksonville since 1991, lost his temper live on air in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

Hicken launched an attack on the network's Olympics anchor Bob Costas, whose tape-delayed broadcast overran by seven minutes and interrupted his show.

'He does it every four years,' Hicken said of Costas, who has has been the prime-time host of a record nine Olympic games.

'Bob doesn't know that 12 o'clock means 12 o'clock. It doesn’t mean 12:02, it doesn’t mean 12:04, it certainly doesn’t mean 12:07.

'Bob, when it’s 12 o’clock, you say goodnight. You don’t care because you’re sleeping right now.'

Hicken said his team was working really hard for Costas, his 'NBC family'.

'I’m glad we had the little gymnast girls. I’m excited about it. I’m glad we got to interview Michael Phelps six times,' he added.

'It's just starting, mark my words Jacksonville. Tomorrow, it'll be 12:09, 12:11, he starts to push it that Bob does.'

But he ended his rant on a more light-hearted note, adding: 'I love him, though,' Hicken added. 'He’s a great broadcaster.'

NBC has come under fire for their Olympics coverage.

On fire: Usain Bolt runs past the Olympic flame after winning the sprint final for Jamaica in scintillating fashion

Twitter
has been flooded with gripes about NBC keeping most day's marquee 
events off the air until they can be shown in prime-time, the broadcast 
that brings in the most viewers and advertising revenue for the network.

It was also forced to apologise after airing an ad featuring a monkey performing gymnastics, right after showing the performance of Gabby Douglas, the first African-American to win Olympic gold.

Considering the hype surrounding the race before it happened, it is really surprising that NBC would have passed over the option to show it live.

The race had been billed as the 
‘hottest ticket’ of London 2012 with people paying prices of up to £725 
to be among those in the stadium who could forever say 'I was there'.

In
 Britain alone the TV audience was expected to be about 15million – a 
quarter of all Britons – with theatres and cinemas putting on special 
screenings that had begun in time to the semi-finals earlier in the 
evening.

Despite
 earlier heavy rain and soggy conditions, thousands who had been at 
other venues inside the Olympic park on so-called ‘Super Sunday’ and 
‘Showdown Sunday’ stayed to watch the race on the big screens.

Among those cheering the athletes on were the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, who 
joined in a standing ovation.

A shower of flashbulbs lit up the stadium as Bolt settled into his blocks at the start line as the crowd took photographs.

It
 stopped for the time it took him to run the 100m and defend his Olympic
 title before the crowd, now on their feet, took more photographs and 
clapped as he went on his lap of honour.

After the race, Bolt said: 'I was happy when I went out in the first round, I felt I could do this.

'I
 was slightly worried about my start. It was not the best reaction in 
the world but I stopped worrying about it and executed it and it worked.

'I said it on the track, people can talk, all they can do is talk. When it comes to championships I bring it.

'I knew [the crowd] would be like this, I can feel that energy and I am extremely happy.'

Speaking about his compatriot and training partner Blake, the champion said: 'In training he always works hard and pushes me.

'I
 knew what I needed to do but I think he will do better next time. He is
 a major talent. He beat almost everybody and I know he will be more 
confident and do better next time.'

Blake, who won silver, said: 'Usain knows what it takes. He is a world beater and he is the fastest man in the world.

'But I got a medal in my first Olympic games and a lot of that is down to Usain and our coach.'

Bronze
 medallist Justin Gatlin, who won bronze in the men's 100m final, told 
BBC Radio 5 live: 'At this moment in time it was probably the dream 
race.

'It was a great race and I think there are even better ones to come.

'Usain
 Bolt has the best technique out there. I tried to hold on with my 
technique and I got back on the podium for the first time in 10 years.'

Gatlin the 2004 Olympic champion was competing in London amid controversy after serving a four-year doping ban.

He said: 'It feels good, regardless of what I have gone through. I did this for the people who support me.

'This medal is for them and they pushed me when I didn't want to push myself.'
