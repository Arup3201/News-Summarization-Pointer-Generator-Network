Distraught bowler Sean Abbott - who delivered the ball that felled Phillip Hughes - was seen leaving St Vincent's Hospital in tears after the death of the batsman.

The 21-year-old, who plays for New South Wales, was bowling when Hughes collapsed at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday and was the first player to rush to his side.

Abbott tenderly embraced Hughes as medical officers rushed onto the field and an ambulance was called.

In the days after the tragic accident, Abbott has reportedly been having a tough time coping and has received counselling and support from players since Tuesday's incident.

On Wednesday, Abbott returned to the SCG for a team counselling session and was supported by teammates and team officials who have been concerned.

At the hospital on Thursday, he was met warmly by his own teammates, friends of Hughes and cricketing greats such as Steve Waugh.

Looking pale and exhausted, Abbott arrived at St Vincent's wearing a navy baseball hat at 2.30pm.

He excited the hospital after learning of Hughes' death wiping away tears with his head bowed and face hidden underneath his cap.

In the hospital's coffee shop, where some of the cricketers had congregated, Abbott was given some words of advice from Waugh, while spin bowler Nathan Lyons draped a comforting arm around his shoulders.

He then sat down and had a coffee with his teammates who were obviously rallying behind the young fast bowler.

All NSW and South Australian players are receiving counselling and psychological support in the wake of the delivery.

The Australian Cricketers' Association said it was monitoring Abbott, who delivered the ball, closely.

It was reported Abbott was struggling as a host of former Australian pace greats jumped to his support.

'[Abbott] has got a lot of support around him from his teammates and also the counselling services,' ACA CEO Alistair Nicholson said.

'He's someone who we're monitoring closely and we know he's got a lot of support around him.'

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said Abbott, who cradled the injured batsman after he crashed to the ground, would get whatever help was required. 

'It says a lot about Sean doesn't it?' Sutherland said. 'Sean will have all the support he needs around him.

'I'm sure his teammates and everyone doesn't feel in any way ill of him for what happened. It's a freak, freak incident.'

Former Australian bowler Stuart Clark told Fox Sports he understood Abbott was 'struggling a bit' and said the incident was not his fault.

'He's out there to get Phil Hughes out. It's a competitive sport. It's professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment,' he said.

'I hope he's got support... You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don't want that.'

There is a long history between Abbott and Hughes who came up through the junior ranks of the NSW cricketing system and are close friends.

Former Test bowler Brett Lee said Abbott did not deserve any of the blame for the incident.

'You know you're always on edge bowling fast or being out there batting,' Lee told Channel 9.

'When you see something as shocking as this you really feel for Phil.

'I know first-hand that no one goes out there to try and maim a batsman, no one tries to hurt a batsman.' 

Lee's sentiments were echoed on social media by other sportsmen.

Cricket legend Glenn McGrath tweeted a message of support out to Sean Abbott.

'Our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott,' he tweeted immediately after his message to Hughes.
