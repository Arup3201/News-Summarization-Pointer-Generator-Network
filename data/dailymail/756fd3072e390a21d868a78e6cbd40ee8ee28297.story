Iraqi authorities are detaining thousands of women illegally and subjecting many to torture because of crimes they allege their husbands committed, a Human Rights Watch report has claimed.

Many women were detained for months or even years without charge while security forces questioned them about their male relatives' activities rather than crimes in which they themselves were implicated, HRW says.

In custody, women described being kicked, slapped, hung upside-down, beaten on the soles of their feet, given electric shocks, threatened with sexual assault by security forces during interrogation, and even raped in front of their relatives and children.

'The abuses of women we documented 
are in many ways at the heart of the current crisis in Iraq,' said HRW's
 deputy Middle East and North Africa director Joe Stork in a statement 
accompanying the report, titled: 'No One Is Safe: Abuses of Women in 
Iraq's Criminal Justice System.'

Mr
 Stark added: 'These abuses have caused a deep-seated anger and lack of 
trust between Iraq's diverse communities and security forces, and all 
Iraqis are paying the price.'

A
 spokesman for Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said the testimonies in the 
HRW report were 'over-exaggerated', but acknowledged that 'we have some 
limited illegal behaviours which were practised by security forces 
against women prisoners', which it said had been identified by the 
ministry's own teams.

These
 teams had referred their reports to the relevant authorities, 'asking 
them to bring those who are responsible for mistreating female detainees
 to justice', the spokesman said.

'Iraq
 is still working to put an end to prison abuse and, with more time, 
understanding of law and patience, such illegal practices will become a 
history,' he said.

The 
105-page report is based on interviews with imprisoned Sunni and Shi'ite
 women and girls, although Sunnis make up the vast majority of the more 
than 4,200 women detained in Interior and Defence Ministry facilities, 
HRW said.

The release of women detainees was a main demand of Sunnis who began demonstrating late in 2012 against the Shi'ite-led government, which they accuse of marginalising their community.

Revelations: The alleged abuses were revealed in the Human Rights Watch report entitled 'No One Is Safe: Abuses Of Women In Iraq's Criminal Justice System'

Security forces cleared one of two Sunni protest camps in Anbar province in December 2013. In the ensuing backlash, militants seized the city of Falluja and parts of Ramadi.

Since then, more than 1,000 people have been killed across Iraq, according to Iraq Body Count, and the army is preparing for a possible ground assault to retake Falluja.

One woman who entered her meeting with HRW at a death row facility in Baghdad on crutches said she had been permanently disabled by abuse, displaying injuries consistent with the mistreatment she alleged.

Seven months later, she was executed despite lower court rulings that dismissed charges against her following a medical report that supported her accusations of torture.

HRW described Iraq's judiciary as weak and plagued by corruption, with convictions frequently based on coerced confessions, and trial proceedings that fall far short of international standards.

If women are released unharmed, they are frequently stigmatised by their family or community, who perceive them to have been dishonoured, HRW said.

'Both men and women suffer from the severe flaws of the criminal justice system. But women suffer a double burden due to their second-class status in Iraqi society,' HRW said.
