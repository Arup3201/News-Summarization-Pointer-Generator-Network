Married couples are in decline, fuelled by changes in social attitudes and the arrival of families from abroad.

The proportion of families with a couple who have tied the knot fell from 70 per cent in 2001 to 65 per cent in 2011, the Office for National Statistics said.

However, there are wide variations between the nationalities of families, with 85 per cent of Indian couples getting married compared to just 35 per cent of those from Somalia.

New research based on the 2011 Census shows that there were 15.8million households living in England and Wales, with 9 in 10 of them comprising of just one family.

While almost two thirds (65 per cent) were married, the proportion with cohabiting couples and lone parent families rose in the decade from 2011.

Some 85 per cent of families were headed by someone born in the UK.

But a breakdown based on the nationality of the ‘family reference person’ shows how rates of marriage, cohabiting and living alone vary depending on where in the world comes from.

The ONS said that just over a third of foreign families were born in the Middle East and Asia (36 per cent), with the two largest countries of birth (India and Pakistan) accounting for more than half (52 per cent) from this region.

Among people born in the UK, 65 per cent of couples were married, ranked 21 out of 35 countries.

Marriage rates were highest among families headed by someone born in India (85 per cent, followed by Sri Lanka (84 per cent) and Afghanistan (83 per cent).

The ONS said: ‘High proportions of married couples may reflect cultural attitudes towards family structures and marriage in the population.’

‘High proportions of lone parent families may reflect reasons for migration (such as conflict in the country of birth) and arrival profiles (as populations that have been I the UK longer have had more time for partnership breakdown),’ the ONS added.

Lone parent families accounted for 18 per cent of all families in England and Wales; the proportion was highest for families headed by someone born in Somalia (60 per cent).

The ONS said: ‘This may reflect Somali-born migrants who arrived during the 1990s following the Somali civil war; many women and children may have left without their partner.’

A third (33 per cent) of Lithuania families were cohabiting, the highest rate in the country, followed by Poland (32 per cent) and France and New Zealand, both on 30 per cent.

Just 3 per cent of families from Bangladesh, Pakistan and India were cohabiting.
