Satisfaction among Britain’s train passengers has plummeted as fares soar, more trains run late and thousands face standing room only on overcrowded trains, damning new figures reveal today.

The official national rail passenger satisfaction survey for Autumn says satisfaction levels are ‘significantly down’ on the same period last year. Among individual train companies over the last 12 months it concluded: ‘None significantly improved and seven declined.’

On the worst commuter routes only just over a quarter (28 per cent) think they get value for money from their price of their ticket – with the rest feeling ripped off.

Packed: Satisfaction among Britain¿s train passengers has plummeted as fares soar, trains run late and carriages are overcrowded, according to a new study

Around one in five passengers are dissatisfied with the quality of service they get from train companies with overall  satisfaction levels dropping to 83 per cent – down  2 percentage points compared to Autumn 2012.

Nationally, after years of fare price hikes fewer than half (45 per cent) of passengers  are satisfied with the ‘value for money’ of their train ticket. This is two percentage points lower than in Autumn 2012 (47 per cent).

But fewer than a third (32 per cent) of passengers on commuter routes feel they get value for money.

Offering worst value for money by train operator is Southeastern with only a third (34 per cent) satisfied with their deal. It is followed by Greater Anglia (36 per cent), and South West Trains  First Capital Connect (both 37 per cent).

But it is passengers on the Greater 
Anglia Stansted Express route who feel most ripped off – with  just 28 
per cent saying they get value for money from their ticket, just ahead 
of those on the Greater Anglia mainline route (29 per cent).

On
 overcrowding only two thirds (66 per cent) are satisfied with the 
amount of sitting or standing space on their train, down by three 
percentage points on the same period last year.

Nor
 are passengers impressed with declining punctuality and reliability 
with satisfaction levels again ‘significantly down’ with more than one 
in five dissatisfied. The proportion who are satisfied has fallen by 
four percentage points to just 79 per cent.

Poor: Train operator Southern received the lowest rating for overall satisfaction with 76 per cent of passengers saying they were satisfied with the service

The worst performer was Southern which ties with London Midland and First Hull trains with just 73 per cent of passengers satisfied, followed by First Capital Connect and First Great Western.

A Passenger Focus spokesman said: ‘Satisfaction levels on punctuality reflect the reality. As punctuality has got worse satisfaction levels have also dropped.’

But the figures from independent consumer watchdog Passenger Focus also show big variations between different rail operators.

Lowest rating for overall satisfaction were given to Southern (76 per cent), Northern Rail (78 per cent), First capital Connect (79 per cent), First Great Western (80 per cent) and Greater Anglia (80 per cent).

Highest ratings were  achieved by Heathrow Express (96 per cent), Grand Central (95 per cent) and  Merseyrail (93 per cent).

Frustration: Around one in five passengers are dissatisfied with the quality of service they get from train companies with overall satisfaction levels dropping to 83 per cent

Overcrowded: Only two thirds are satisfied with the amount of sitting or standing space on their train, down by three percentage points on the same period last year

Dissatisfaction was among its highest on commuter routes in London and the South East. Here the report notes: ‘The two biggest declines in satisfaction were  with punctuality/reliability (down 5 per cent) and how well train companies dealt with delays (down 5 per cent).

Among long-distance operators satisfaction at dealing  with delays was down by 7 percentage points.

Passenger Focus acting chief executive David Sidebottom said: ‘There are gaps of around 20 per cent between the best and worst-performing services, and satisfaction with value for money varied from 28 to 82 per cent.’

He noted:’Although generally satisfaction has remained fairly high over the last five years, we want to see a more consistently high level of service for passengers, wherever they may be travelling to and from.’

Delayed: The Passenger Focus report said punctuality was a key factor in rail passenger satisfaction

Out of pocket: Fewer than a third of passengers on commuter routes feel they get value for money

The Passenger Focus report says: ‘The key factor in rail passenger satisfaction remains punctuality. The satisfaction rating has dropped since the last Autumn survey – from 83 to 79 per cent – reflecting a drop in actual punctuality over this period. However, passenger punctuality ratings have barely changed in the last five years. In 2008 it was 81 per cent.’

The report adds: ‘How train operators handled delays dropped from last year’s 44 to 40 per cent satisfaction – and varied between 23 and 69 per cent across the country. Although this is a slight improvement on the situation in 2008 (when this factor scored 37 per cent), it is disappointing considering the amount of work that has gone into helping operators better manage and communicate during delays.'

The survey was carried out between September and November 2013, before announcements on rail fare increases which Passenger Focus predicts will have some impact on the next survey results.

Under the new and capped price-rise formula average regulated fares may increase by up to 3.1 per cent. But train companies can also use a 2.0 per   flexibility or ‘flex’ regulation which lets them put some regulated fares up by 5.1per cent provided their  overall average does not exceed the 3.1 per cent cap. Each January increase is calculated from the RPI rate of inflation figure for the previous July, which in 2013 was 3.1 per cent.

The increase could have been even greater, but Chancellor George Osborne announced in his Autumn Statement in early December that, to ease some of the pain,  planned price cap price cap of RPI inflation plus 1per cent was being changed to RPI plus 0per cent - or in line with inflation only.

Rises on unregulated fares, typically off-peak leisure tickets, are not capped. But some of these fares, including on the East Coast route, are going up by much less than 3.1 per cent. The overall rise in tickets - regulated and unregulated – is  2.8 per cent.

But campaign groups complain that fares are still rising three times faster than wages and want a change to a ‘fairer’ model.
