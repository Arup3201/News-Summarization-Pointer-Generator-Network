Britain’s economic recovery is being put at risk because too many school leavers cannot write properly, add up or even wear appropriate clothes for work, a leading business group has claimed.

The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), which represents nearly 200,000 companies, said a chronic shortage of the most basic skills by school leavers means companies are losing out to foreign competition.

FSB’s Mike Cherry said: ‘We have been trailing behind in business globally for far too long because of the skills shortage.

'It is probably the most serious issue facing firms. The low standard of numeracy and literacy skills is a huge problem, as is employability. Many are not prepared for the workplace in their attitude or dress.’

The FSB is not alone in bemoaning a lack of skills.

Last year the British Chambers of Commerce said many employers had been left ‘disheartened and frustrated’ by poor levels of literacy, numeracy, communication and time-keeping among school leavers and graduates.

It warned an over-emphasis by schools on sitting exams and hitting targets meant children had not developed social skills needed at work.
