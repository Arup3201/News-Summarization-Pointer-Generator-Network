White goods manufacturer Beko has been fined more than £75,000 after admitting it failed to reveal to authorities for four years that thousands of its cookers were potentially unsafe and could cause deadly carbon monoxide poisoning.

The Turkish firm, which is one of the world's biggest kitchen appliance manufacturers, was aware from 2009 that 23 different models of its cookers produced the deadly gas from its grill if used in very particular circumstances.

The domestic appliance giant, which has its UK headquarters in Watford, Hertfordshire, knew of a risk which can occur when some of its cookers are converted for use with LPG gas but didn't inform Hertfordshire County Council Trading Standards until August last year following an ITV News investigation.

Andrew Mullen, Beko's quality manager for the UK and Ireland, yesterday pleaded guilty to 23 counts of failing to notify Trading Standards about the fault on behalf of the company at Watford Magistrates' Court.

On behalf of Beko, Mr Mullen admitted that the company failed in its obligation to notify the authority about the potential risk to the cookers, after concerns arose that they were not 'safe products' if used with bottled gas and with the door closed.

The manufacturer's instructions warn customers not to keep the door shut when using the grill oven but the company failed to inform the Trading Standards of the risk when using the LPG kit - which converts the appliance from using natural gas to liquid petroleum.

The company had faced a total of 69 charges brought by the council but the remainder were dropped following the guilty pleas.

Under safety regulations, the company is required to tell the local authority of problems involving its products as soon as they are discovered.

Prosecutor Miles Bennett said: 'When they are aware they should notify them forthwith that their products are unsafe.

'Once it was decided for it [the cooker models] to be converted into LPG it posed a substantial risk if the grill door was kept in the shut position when it was on, because there was a substantial risk of a build up of carbon monoxide. There's a substantial risk of injury and death.'

Of the company's failures, Mr Bennett added: 'It went on, not for weeks or months, but years from February 2009 to July 2013.

'Beko, in February 2009, realised there was a problem with some of their cookers and as Beko's HQ is in Watford, Hertfordshire Council Trading Standards takes a role as its "Home Authority".

'If there is an issue or problem it should notify Hertfordshire County Council so it can notify all other authorities.

'The local authority can't do its job properly if it's not notified by the company.

'They had been aware that the 23 models posed a risk and we say a substantial risk because of carbon monoxide.'

Michael Uberoi, defending, said the company admitted that there had been a 'genuine oversight' to notify the authority.

He said the company had contacted owners of the affected conversion kits but had only failed to notify the council because of the oversight.

Beko was fined £77,660 and ordered to pay £11,000 in costs after admitting the failings.

Following the hearing, the company confirmed 23 models of cooker – all made before 2009 – were found to be potentially dangerous when converted for use with bottled gas and used with the door closed.

Of the 2,320 converter kits provided to households by Beko, more than half have been traced and the owners informed of the dangers by the kitchen appliance giant. 

However, a total of 836 remain unaccounted for.

A company spokesman said: 'Beko acknowledges it should have notified Hertfordshire Trading Standards about the LPG conversion kits issue as soon it was aware of the matter.

'It accepts responsibility for not doing so. Finding these LPG kits was Beko's priority at the time and its efforts are continuing through a wide range of activities.

'It is important to record that the charges relate solely to Beko's communications with Hertfordshire Trading Standards around the LPG kit issue, not its extensive activities to trace the kits.

'These LPG kits are designed to convert specific models of pre-2009 Beko-manufactured mains gas cookers to run on bottled gas.

'We are only looking for a limited number of LPG kits in relation to this issue. None of Beko's current range of cookers is affected.'

Richard Thake, cabinet member for community safety at Hertfordshire County Council, said he was pleased the court had taken a 'serious view' of the matter.

He said: 'I am deeply disappointed that it has proven necessary for us to initiate court proceedings in this case.

'The fact that this prosecution has been successful is gratifying and the level of penalty imposed, plus the fact that costs have been awarded, is an indication that the court has taken a serious view of this matter.
