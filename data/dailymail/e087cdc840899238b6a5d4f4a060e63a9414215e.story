In the wake of the Trayvon Martin case, President Obama on Friday made some unprecedented comments about the prejudice faced by black males in the United States.

His speech about his own experiences with racial prejudice reminded one journalist of an exclusive party that she and Barack Obama, before he was President, both attended, at which Obama was mistaken for a waiter.

Katie Rosman, a journalist with the Wall Street Journal, recalled the incident in a blog post for the publication in 2008.

Insulting: President Obama experienced racial profiling at an exclusive party 10 years ago when an author mistook him for a waiter and asked him for a drink, recalled journalist Katie Rosman (right)

She tweeted a link to the Wall Street Journal story after President Obama shared some of his personal experiences of being discriminated against, supporting Obama's assertion that the fact of discrimination against black men is 'inescapable'.

Book party: Rosman and Obama were both attendees at the soiree thrown by Tina Brown

Rosman was a freelance journalist in 
2003 when she attended a party for the launch of Sidney Blumenthal's 
book, 'The Clinton Wars' hosted by journalist Tina Brown in her New York
 home. Â

She herself
 wasn't invited to the party, but attended as a plus-one of one of the 
invited guests. Rosman was hoping to meet some editors and possibly drum
 up a little work.

Feeling 'awkward and out of place,' Rosman stood by herself on the periphery of the party, not knowing what to do, when she saw someone looking exactly how she felt.

The African-American man was standing by himself, so Rosman approached him and introduced herself. She discovered that he was an up-and-coming Illinois state senator who was running for Senate.

His name was Barack Obama, and he was one of only a handful of black people at the party. Rosman found him 'charismatic in a quiet, solemn way'.

He told her about his campaign and Rosman thought his would make a good story (the magazine she pitched the story to declined).

When she was leaving the party, Rosman bumped into another guest she describes as 'an established author' who questioned her about her new acquaintance.

The author sheepishly told her that he hadn't realized Obama was an invited guest to the party and had asked him 'to fetch him a drink'.

Unannounced speech: President Obama's comments concerning the Trayvon Martin case and the experiences of black people in the U.S. is being hailed as one of his greatest

President Obama's surprise speech is being hailed by some as one of the most important of his career.

'There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.

There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me - at least before I was a senator.

There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often,' he told reporters.
