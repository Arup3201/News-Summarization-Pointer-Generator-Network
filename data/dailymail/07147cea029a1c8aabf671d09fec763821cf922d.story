Tragedy: Bolutito Shodipe was hit and killed as her mother parked her car yesterday

A mother has knocked down and killed her own daughter while trying to park her car.

Bolutito Shodipe was run over outside Hounslow West tube station in south-west London yesterday morning.

The six-year-old's devastated family are 'coming to terms with this terrible accident' as British Transport Police investigates what happened.

Bolutito's mother was attempting to park her car outside the station at around 9.40am when she struck her child.

Police and London Ambulance Service paramedics tried to resuscitate Bolutito at the scene but she was later pronounced dead at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington.

A family statement released by police said: 'Bolutito was our eldest daughter and no-one could have asked for a better daughter.

'She was a beautiful, well behaved, girl who loved ballet and who will be sorely missed by all of us.

'This is an extremely upsetting time for us and we ask that we be given the respect and space to grieve and to come to terms with this terrible accident.'

DCI Iain Miller of British Transport Police said detectives are working to determine how the incident occurred.

He said: 'Our officers attended, alongside colleagues from the Metropolitan Police Service and London Ambulance Service, and discovered a child - a six-year-old girl - had sustained fatal injuries having been struck by a car being driven by her mother.

Incident: Police and paramedics treated the six-year-old outside Hounslow West Station yesterday morning

'It is clear that both mother and child arrived together in the car park and the accident occurred during a parking manoeuvre.

'Specialist officers are now providing full support to the girl's family whilst detectives are working to determine exactly how the incident occurred.'
