Medical tourist: More Brits are going abroad for cosmetic surgery

Forget jetting away to find sun and tropical beaches, millions of Brits are now using their holidays as an opportunity to undergo cosmetic surgery. 

Demand for 'cosmetic surgery tourism' has risen as the number of people travelling overseas for treatments has more than doubled in the past two years, according to new research by private healthcare search engine WhatClinic.com.

The ability to get cheaper treatments is the main reason more people are opting to have dentures, boob jobs and bottom lifts abroad.

But it's not just cosmetics treatments which are proving popular with tourists, more Brits are also travelling over seas for fertility treatment.

Even with the cost of flights and hotels, the total spend adds up to less than the bill for private surgery in the UK.

The research has revealed which destinations are the most popular for various procedures. 

For example, Thailand has proven a hotspot for dentures, with demand soaring by 320 per cent in the past year. On average a full set of dentures costs £184 in Bangkok, which is £256 cheaper than in the UK.

Hungary is also quickly becoming a renowned hot spot for cosmetic dentistry and a preferred choice for those who don't fancy flying to the other side of the world in search of the perfect smile. The country has seen a 172 per cent
 increase in demand for dental implants, while lingual braces are up by 
almost a fifth in the past year alone. Dental implants in the UK will
 set you back £1,928 but in Hungary the same procedure costs a quarter 
of the price (£500). 

Eastern Europe boasts the largest number of hubs for cosmetic tourism, as short flights and cheap fares with budget airlines prove popular with patients. The Czech Republic has seen a 304 per cent increase in interest for nose jobs in the past year, with an average procedure costing £847, versus £3,557 in the UK. The operation, which separates the nasal skin and soft tissue from the nasal framework, allows the nose to be reshaped.

Meanwhile, those looking for breast implants are heading to Poland. Enquiries there have risen by 57 per cent
 in the past year. With flights taking just over two hours and costing 
as little as £42 return from London to Warsaw, patients can look to 
still make considerable savings by paying £1,972 in Poland for the 
operation, instead of £3,736 in Britain.

Huge costs attached to IVF and NHS waiting lists
 have also led to serious growth in fertility hubs around Europe. In the
 Czech Republic, one treatment will cost £791 but in the UK it costs 
£2,420.

Greece offers egg donation and 
pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) at a considerable saving 
compared to the UK - patients can save between £700 and £900 per 
treatment.

Caelen King, CEO of WhatClinic.com, comments: 'The biggest draw of medical and cosmetic tourism is price - as Brits going abroad can look to make considerable savings even after the travel costs. You may even be able to tie it in with a holiday for less than the cost of the procedure in the UK.

'But with any procedure, wherever it's done, make sure you do your research and shop around. Speak to a number of specialists until you find one that you are comfortable with. If you do decide to go overseas, be realistic about recovery time and getting home.

'There are fantastic cosmetic surgeons all over the world but some countries are less regulated, so standards can vary dramatically depending on where you go. Ask about aftercare and what happens if something does go wrong, as it may be more difficult to fix without needing a return trip.'
