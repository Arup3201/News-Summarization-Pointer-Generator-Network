Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo has caused fury after posting a picture of drug lord Pablo Escobar to hisInstagram account.

On Saturday, the 24-year-old incensed many Colombians with the photo of the late cocaine king who was linked to hundreds of deaths in their country during the 1980s and '90s.

Accompanied with the picture was a caption that read: 'Only those who went hungry with me and stood by me when I went through a bad time at some point in life will eat at my table.'

Rojo's post has been publicly slammed with fans writing online to show their disdain for the Argentina international's social media upload.

Jamie Ortega wrote: 'Sh***y Argentines. They dignify Escobar because they didn't suffer the decades of pain our country experienced. I wish they'd had them in Argentina instead of here.'

Andres Gonzalez concurred with Ortega's sentiments as he added: 'Simply seeing Escobar's picture is enough to generate disagreements of the deaths he caused.'

Escobar was shot by police in Medellin, Colombia in 1993 after making an estimated £20billion.
