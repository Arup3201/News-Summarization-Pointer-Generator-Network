A Glaswegian grandmother has started speaking with an Italian accent after suffering a stroke, despite never having visited the country.

Debbie McCann, 48, had a strong Glaswegian accent before the minor stroke in November last year.

But in the weeks following her illness she lost the ability to speak at all only to regain a voice she didn't recognise as her own.

Diagnosed: Debbie McCann is thought to have Foreign Accent Syndrome, which left her speaking with a Chinese and then an Italian accent

‘For the first two weeks, I couldn't speak and it was very frustrating,' said Ms McCann.

'When my voice came back, I sounded Chinese. I couldn't believe it.

‘Now, people say I sound more like I'm from Italy, yet, I've never been to either of those countries.’

She was diagnosed with Foreign Accent Syndrome in June after friends said they thought she had the condition after seeing a clip of a sufferer online.

Foreign Accent Syndrome is an extremely rare medical condition that affects just 60 
people worldwide and leaves a person speaking in a different 
accent due to a brain injury, stroke or migraine.

The condition has left her embarrassed about speaking and is having a terrible impact on her life.

Suffering: The condition has become a nightmare for Debbie McCann, who is now embarrassed to speak to people

‘I'm having speech therapy and every day I wake up hoping my old voice will be back’, she said.

‘We laughed about it in the beginning but it's become a nightmare for me.’

She said it's only now she feels brave enough to go out on her own.

The grandmother-of-two added: ‘It's made me very embarrassed to speak to people. I only go shopping where I used to work because everyone knows me there.

‘Otherwise I'm constantly having to explain myself.

‘I don't like speaking on the phone. When I called the Job Centre to apply for disability allowance, the lady asked me where I was from.

‘I said Glasgow and she said: 'No, where are you from originally?' I had to explain to her I had Foreign Accent Syndrome.

'As time has gone on though, I feel more comfortable.’

The former shop assistant was at home with her only daughter, Julieanne, when her hands started shaking and her speech became slurred.

The 24-year-old sat her mother down in a chair but she slumped to one side and when she was taken to hospital a doctor said he believed she may have suffered a minor stroke.

Tests, however, including an MRI scan, came back clear.

Ms McCann has an appointment with a neurologist in November and she hopes they will confirm that she had a stroke. Since her illness she has been left with weakness on the right side of her body and she has been unable to drive.

The condition also affects her facial movements and she not only talks in a foreign accent but writes in broken English - meaning she often misses out words like 'to' and 'a' from sentences.

When she wrote to a friend that she had been referred for treatment to a stroke clinic, she actually wrote: ‘I been referred to stroke clinic.’ 

Her daughter, a residential children's worker said: ‘This time last year, she was a completely different person. She was so outgoing and would talk to anyone.

‘Now it's me that has to do a lot of the speaking when we go out.

‘It's been totally life changing. Her thick Glaswegian accent was part of her identity.’

The condition was first identified in the 1940s when a Norwegian woman was hit by shrapnel and started speaking with a strong German accent.

Dr Anja Lowitt, an expert in the condition from Strathclyde University whom Ms McCann consulted about her speech, said: ‘Foreign Accent Syndrome is extremely rare and usually follows some kind of brain injury. In most cases a stroke, but it could potentially also be a head injury.

‘What happens is that the person's speech disorder mimics features of one or more foreign accents.

‘So it could be that the person's speech now contains a sound that exists in French, or a particular intonation pattern typical for Italian.

‘If the speech includes features from several accents, the listener often hears the one they are most familiar with. It's also the reason why we only hear common accents.

‘Unfortunately there is currently no cure for Foreign Accent Syndrome. With some people it disappears after a year or two, others will never lose it.

‘It depends on the initial severity of the speech problem and how well the brain recovers.’
