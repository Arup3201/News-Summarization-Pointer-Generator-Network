A father-of-three has lost a whopping 18 stone after fearing he would not be around long enough to watch his sons grow up.

Wayne Robinson, 37, ballooned to a whopping 31 stone, and had a BMI of 59 - almost three times what it should be.

And after he started skipping doctors appointments - fearing he was too fat to be examined - he realised that he was living on borrowed time.

Mr Robinson realised he was on borrowed time after he started skipping medical appointments for fear he was too fat to be examined, which prompted the dramatic change

After ditching takeaways and signing up to a diet plan, Mr Robinson soon started to shed the pounds - and just nine months later, weighs a healthy 13st 4lb.

Mr Robinson, from Currock, Carlisle, said: 'I was a ticking time bomb, but still that wasn't enough to make me lose weight.

'What really made me decide to do it were my boys and the thought of them growing up without a dad.

'I vividly remember reading somewhere that the life expectancy for someone with a BMI of 40 was 20 years less than someone with a healthy BMI around 25 - and mine was much, much higher.

'That made me realise that I was living on borrowed time.

'My life had come to the point where I was making a conscious effort to constantly avoid embarrassing situations.

'I never went to my sons' parents' evenings, as I was worried about them being bullied about my size.

'And I would always avoid going on planes - as I was terrified I'd have to ask for a seatbelt extension.'

But now, Mr Robinson's wife Sam, 37, and sons William, 14, Harry, 11, and Finley, four, couldn't be prouder of their newly-slim husband and dad.

The pounds had slowly crept on over the years while Wayne was working at a desk job for travel agent Thomas Cook.

He said: 'I signed up to the LighterLife Weight Loss Management system, and I lost about half a stone a week.

'It has completely transformed my life.

'The change has been unbelievable and not just physically. Inside I am a completely different person.

'I'd had no major health scare to speak of, although at the size I was I generally tended to avoid the embarrassment of visiting the doctors.

'But I was in denial for many years, because with a BMI of 59 it wasn't a case of if I fell ill, it was when.

'I'd lost my mum in my mid 20s to bowel cancer and I just didn't want that for my boys. I wanted to be around to see them grow up.

'Because of my mum's early death, when I reached 35, I was supposed to go for a routine screening to make sure the cancer could be caught early if I was unlucky enough to have it as well.

'I'd received the letter from the hospital but I was so worried that the hospital wouldn't be able to do it because of the size of me that I didn't go.

'Even though I knew one of major reasons that mum died was because it wasn't detected earlier, the embarrassment and fear kept me away. I never want to feel like that again.

'I'm the miraculous shrinking man - my weight loss has far exceeded all my expectations.'
