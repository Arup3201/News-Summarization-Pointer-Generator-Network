Ask and they shall deliver!

After releasing a photo of President Obama skeet shooting, the predictions of his former advisor David Plouffe came true when the picture turned into the basis for the latest meme.

Creative Photoshop users changed it so that rather than having the President taking aim at small birds, they added in thought bubbles, flowers, and political context to make alternative versions.

On Saturday morning, the White House released the photo of Obama shooting at clay pigeons at the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland.

Political statement: Some pranksters changed it so that the President would be 'taking aim' at the Second Amendment, which is the one that specifies the right to bare arms

Comical? Some internet pranksters swapped out bullets for flowers, and had alternate clothing options

Different setting: This version has the President as a character in the video game Grand Theft Auto

Mr Plouffe couldn't resist mocking those who might claim the photograph of President Obama shooting was fake and tweeted: 'Attention skeet birthers. Make our day - let the photoshop conspiracies begin!'

White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer also joined in the teasing and tweeted the picture of the President with a shout-out to the 'skeeters' - namely people who might claim the image is false.

Both men received a large amount of online abuse for their attempts at humor.

The image of President Obama shooting at clay targets was released at a time when he is pushing a package of gun-control measures in response to the Newtown, Connecticut school shooting.

The National Rifle Association, which has rejected Obama's proposals, scoffed at the photo.

‘One picture does not erase a lifetime of supporting every gun ban and every gun-control scheme imaginable,’ said Andrew Arulanandam, the organization's spokesman.

Two days before President Barack Obama's first trip outside Washington to promote his gun-control proposals, the White House tried on Saturday to settle a brewing mystery by releasing a photo to back his claim to be a skeet shooter.

Making the message clear: President Obama has previously been criticized for his use of drones

Old school: An older Ninetendo version was also produced

Target practice: This one mentions the Republican majority leader by name

President Obama had set inquiring minds spinning when, in an interview with The New Republic magazine, he answered ‘yes’ when asked if he had ever fired a gun. The admission came as a surprise to many.

‘Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time,’ Obama said in the interview released last weekend, referring to the official presidential retreat in rural Maryland, which he last visited in October while campaigning for re-election.
