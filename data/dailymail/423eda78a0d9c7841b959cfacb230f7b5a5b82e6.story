An immigrant who stabbed a disabled jeweller to death in a bungled robbery while on the run from a Polish prison has been jailed for life.

Ireneusz Melaniuk, 28, who had a long criminal record in his native Poland murdered frail Peter Avis, 66, in his flat above his old fashioned shop Collis & Son in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.

The tattooed fugitive fled with silverware worth thousands of pounds on the night of January 13 and flew back to Poland two days later.

An international hunt was launched for him and he was arrested in Biala Podlaska, Poland, in February, after being traced through friends who were in contact with him by phone and Facebook.

He was jailed for life by Judge John Devaux at Ipswich Crown Court today and ordered to serve a minimum of 26 years after he admitted murder and burglary.

Melaniuk was two years into a 
three-and-a-half year jail sentence for robbery when he failed to return
to prison in Chelm, Poland, after being given day release in 2007.

He sneaked into Britain in 2009.

Polish authorities did not put him on
a European ‘watch list’ so UK officials did not know he should be 
detained if he arrived in Britain using his own passport

'Old-fashioned family business': The jewellery shop in Bury St Edmunds where Mr Avis was killed

His case has raised concerns about the ease with which foreign criminals are able to get into Britain.

Mr Avis who was found dead in his bed was stabbed 13 times and beaten about the face with a glass ash tray. Jewellery, watches and ornaments worth thousands of pounds were stolen in the raid.

He was described as “an old fashioned jeweller” who relied on a walking stick and frame to get around after suffering a brain aneurysm more than 20 years ago.

Mr Avis was said to be a gentle and private man who was passionate about classic cars and “as sharp as a button”. He had lived alone since the death of his mother in 1989.

His family released a statement after his death, saying: 'His life centred on his shop and flat. Due to this he was, perhaps, extremely vulnerable.'

Police later announced they were hunting Melaniuk who had distinctive features including two middle fingers and a thumb missing from his right hand.

Judge Devaux told him: 'You have previous convictions in Poland for offences which include burglary and robbery.

'You were unlawfully at large on 
January 13 and 14 when the murder happened. When you murdered Peter Avis
you should have been in Poland not at large in this country.

'You murdered a particularly vulnerable man, in his home and using a knife which you had brought to the scene.

Tragedy: Mr Avis was described as an 'old-fashioned jeweller' who relied on a walking stick and frame to get around after suffering a brain aneurysm more than 20 years ago

'Your victim was powerless and unable to defend himself yet you repeatedly wounded him. It is an aggravating factor that when you committed murder you were a criminal on the run.'

Prosecutor Peter Gair told the court that Melaniuk had served previous jail terms in Poland for theft, burglary and robbery.

He added: 'He was wanted for some time in Poland and at some point crossed into Britain where he eventually committed murder.'

Melaniuk and his accomplices carefully planned the raid, knowing that there were valuable items in the shop and that Mr Avis was vulnerable, Mr Gair said.

When he was arrested, Melaniuk told 
police that he did not know anybody was inside the property and panicked
when Mr Avis disturbed him.

Asked why he had the knife used in the
attack, he told officers: 'I was in the habit of carrying a knife 
because I used to do this in Poland.'

Weapon: This knife was found on Melaniuk's person following his arrest in Poland

The total value of the goods stolen could not be calculated because much of the jewellery could not be traced.

After the raid, Melaniuk was caught on CCTV at the Opera House nightclub in London giving out jewellery to women.

Police found £5,000 of jewellery which had not been disposed of. Melaniuk was identified through the DNA database.

Kamel Kita, 21, Pawel Pacian, 35, 
Pawel Borowiecki, 31, and Aleksandra Karpiuk, 27, all played a part in 
either planning the burglary or helping Melaniuk escape. They were all 
jailed at a previous hearing.

Vicky Ford, MEP for the East of England, said the case raised questions over how European countries share information. She said: 'We need to have the basic protections regarding a handful of dangerous criminals.

Under scrutiny: Ireneus Melaniuk's identity card

'Does that mean demanding the sharing of information by countries? That’s the question we are asking.'

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: 'The onus for flagging someone’s criminal history lies with the police in their home country - we would then use this information to decide whether they should be allowed into the UK.'

Bury St Edmunds Conservative MP David Ruffley said: 'On the face of it, the first question we should ask is how did an escaped criminal on the run from Poland not get picked up at the UK border?

'Either he had false documents that were not detected or he may have been smuggled in.

'Either way, this certainly reminds us of the need to tighten our borders so that heinous crimes like this don’t happen on our doorstep in Suffolk.'
