With gaping eyes and silky-soft fur, these adorable creatures have become a YouTube sensation and a must-have pet.

But their popularity threatened their very survival.

Captured by illegal traders and kept in hideous conditions, the primates from Sumatra, Indonesia, were due to be sold in one of Java's notorious animal markets as exotic pets.

Rescued: 238 slow lorises were seized as they were transported by illegal traders to a Javan animal market

But just days before they reached their destination, the gang was caught by British animal rights volunteers, who have handed the lorises to International Animal Rescue.

At 238, it is the largest number of lorises ever seized from illegal traders - and six more had died en route.

On arrival, the IAR medical team examined the confiscated primates.

Many
 were suffering from stress-related illnesses, dehydration, malnutrition
 and dental problems as some had had their teeth cut even before 
reaching the markets.

Small and gentle, they were crammed by their kidnappers into suffocatingly small and starved of food.

Targeted: It is the largest number pf the highly sought-after creatures saved by International Animal Rescue

Trauma: All the primates were suffering from trauma at being suffocated and having their teeth cut

Danger: A further six slow lorises died en route from Sumatra to Java where they were to be sold as exotic pets

‘Many of these slow lorises will require immediate medical treatment in order for them to be nursed back to health,' said Dr Karmele Llano Sanchez, programme director of IAR Indonesia.

‘The goal will be to begin, as soon as possible, a systematic release process for the fit and healthy individuals.

‘These endangered animals are transported for long distances in awful conditions.

'All
 of them suffer during this process and some of them do not even make it
 to the markets where all these lorises were to have their teeth cut to 
be sold to people who want lorises as pets.'

The rescued slow lorises - also called Nycticebus coucan - are now being cared for in the charity's Primate Rehabilitation Centre in Bogor.

Care: Many of them are also dehydrated, under-nourished and in severe pain as they recover in a shelter

Serious problem: As slow lorises soar in popularity, more and more are being illegally traded in south east Asia

Hundreds: IAR Indonesia has 400 of them in care today and volunteers are being dispatched to compensate

Gavin Bruce, IAR operations manager, saw the lorises when they arrived and claims it 'nearly broke his heart'.

‘They arrived at night – dozens of white plastic crates packed full of lorises. I think the final count was 238. Only six dead, I was expecting worse. But still, upsetting as hell.

‘There was one crate of mothers with babies, another with really young ones. Some, inevitably, had damage to their eyes. It was horrible to witness.’

The illegal trade of lorises remains rife.

Alan Knight, Chief Executive of International Animal Rescue, based in Sussex, said the IAR centre has had to expand to cope with the rising numbers of slow lorises being rescued by Indonesian police and wildlife authorities.

Market: After numerous cute YouTube videos, the animals have become a must-have for market sellers

Penalty: Capturing, selling or keeping of slow lorises is punishable by five years in prison and £7,000 in Indonesia

‘I hope the public will support us in helping our team in Indonesia care for these lorises,’ he added.

At the IAR Primate Rehabilitation Centre there are now almost 400 lorises.

Slow lorises are small-bodied nocturnal primates found throughout South-east Asia that are threatened by habitat loss, the illegal trade for pets and traditional medicine.

They are listed on Appendix 1 of CITES thereby prohibiting any international trade.

Furthermore, as stated by Indonesian law, the capturing, selling, or keeping of slow lorises is punishable by up to five years imprisonment with a fine of up to £7,000.

However, despite their protected status, slow lorises remain one of the most heavily traded primates in Indonesia as they are regarded as a ‘status symbol’ pet.
