It looks like a giant tornado is causing mayhem in the sky - but this image is simply the reflection of a river running through a mine.

To create this spectacular moment, photographer Tomas Bogonez went to the Rio Tinto's mining zone along the Rio Tinto river in Huelva, Spain.

A site along the river has been used for mining for centuries and that is why the colours in the photographs are so bright and vivid.

Twisted weather: Although the image appears to show a flame-red twister, it is actually the deep red hue of Spain's Rio Tinto river

Firestorm: Centuries of mining have created the incredibly rich colours in the water

Other images of the bright red river bed show what appears to be a sky cracked with fiery lightning and orange-hued clouds.

It was mined for copper, silver and gold, and now the water is very acidic - resulting in a deep reddish hue because of the dissolved iron.

Tomas, from Guadalajara in Spain, admits this wasn't the first time he visited the special place.

The 59-year-old said: 'I have been to this beautiful place several times to take photographs, but this is my most memorable set of pictures.

Electric: This vibrant image looks like an ethereal flame-coloured lightning storm, complete with clouds

Heat: This is not lava, pouring out from a fissure beneath the sea, but a vein of dissolved iron ore beneath a river

'The photographs show the bright colours of the bed - I have never seen it so vibrant before.

'The texture of the river was mind-blowing, the bright colours and the reflection of the river was amazing to see."

He added: 'The colour of the river depends on the time, hour of the day, month of the year and even the level of water.

River of time: The area has been mined for more than 5,000 years by a variety of different civilizations

'If the level of water is high, the bottom is not seen and therefore the colour is dimmer and the photographs aren't great.'

The area around the Rio Tinto has been mined since ancient times. In approximately 3,000 BCE, Iberians and Tartessians began mining the site, followed by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Visigoths, and Moors.

After a period of abandonment, the mines were rediscovered in 1556 and the Spanish government began operating them once again in 1724.
