Cristiano Ronaldo took a break from his best-of-enemies routine with Lionel Messi to urge his son to walk up and speak to the Argentina ace just before the Ballon d’Or bash.

The duo were minutes away from going head to head to see who would be crowned the world's best player at the awards ceremony in Zurich, Switzerland.

But there was certainly no hostility between the pair as Ronaldo urged his son to introduce himself to the Barcelona forward after claiming that Cristiano Jnr was a big fan.

In the video, translated on AS's website, Ronaldo explains how his son had seen clips of Messi and that the pair had spoken about them afterwards.

Messi is quick to introduce himself to a shy Cristiano Jnr, before asking the youngster how he is and whether he is well.

However, the moment between the pair proved to be short-lived as a nervous Cristiano Jnr returned to his father after going quiet in front of his hero.

The youngster went on to see his father beat Messi to the award for the second straight year and win for the third time overall. Messi still leads the head-to-head count 4-3.

Although it is not clear whether Cristiano Jnr was disappointed to see his new friend miss out...
