It was meant to be a family memento of mummy’s battle against breast cancer.

But the video of Sara Etchells’ hair being shaved off by her daughter touched the hearts of thousands around the world after it was posted on YouTube.

Now the mother-of-six has revealed that she is out of the woods and credits the poignant experience with helping her to take control of her illness.

Scroll down for video

Sara, pictured with her daughter Lola and husband Craig, is spending her first Christmas for two years without the fear of chemotherapy or surgery

The family made the video in an attempt to help Lola deal with her mother's illness

The footage of then six-year-old Lola 
cutting Mrs Etchells’ hair was shot by husband Craig in January 2012 to 
show ‘how mummy would look’ after chemotherapy.

But
 family and friends were so moved by the three-minute film that the 
couple decided to use it to raise money for cancer charities.

Since then, the clip has had 150,000 hits on YouTube and helped raise almost £7,000 for Cancer Research UK.

The Etchells praised their employers, friends and family for the help they have given them over the past two years

Although the family only originally planned for the video to be for private viewing, the reaction of friends and family prompted them to make it public

Sara says that Lola's interest in hairdressing and playing with dolls hair gave her the idea that her daughter should help shave her head

Mrs
 Etchells, 46, said yesterday: ‘When I was first diagnosed with cancer I
 wanted the children to be aware of what I was going through and I 
wanted them to be included.

‘Lola
 had always been interested in hairdressing and dolls so I asked her if 
she wanted to help me cut off my hair. She said yes and that’s how it 
started.

‘It was so traumatic for me to lose my hair but Lola started laughing and we laughed together.

Sara and Craig feel their daughter's experience of cutting off her mum's hair has sparked a further interest in hairdressing

The video became an internet sensation, gaining 150,000 hits and consequently helping the family to raise almost £7,000 for Cancer Research UK

‘Even though I wanted to cry inside, rather than doing that we decided to turn it into fun.’

And
 she said it became cathartic: ‘It was such a tremendous relief. By 
cutting my hair I felt I had taken some control back off the cancer.’

While
 doctors have told the health support worker they may never be able to 
give her a definite all-clear, before Christmas she learned that she 
won’t require any more chemotherapy or surgery.

Instead she is undergoing hormone treatment and visiting the hospital for regular check-ups.

‘They are just keeping me safe now and giving me preventative medicine to prevent the cancer from coming back,’ she said.

‘My
 hair is growing back and I love going to the hairdressers now.’

Now 
aged eight, Lola’s interest  in hairdressing has only increased 
following the success of the video shot at their home in Oldham, Greater
 Manchester.

‘We don’t know if she would have been this interested in 
hair had it not been for her cutting my hair during the chemotherapy,’ 
added Mrs Etchells.
