A 22-year-old Arizona man turned himself in to police this week and admitted to beating his girlfriend, a 19-year-old college student, to death with a dumbbell in their apartment days earlier.

The victim has been identified as Arizona State University junior and Minnesota native Rebecca 'Becky' Kasper, whose decomposing body was discovered in the bathtub in the off-campus apartment she shared with Luis Soltero.

Court documents made public Wednesday state that Soltero, who is not believed to be a student, left a note next to the apparent murder weapon allegedly admitting to the brutal slaying.

According to a statement released by ASU, Kasper was a junior majoring in marketing.

'ASU extends its sincere condolences to her family and friends at this difficult time,' the statement read. 'Counseling services for those who knew Kasper are being made available to the university community.'

In a Wednesday night press conference, the 19-year-old's father, Dan Kasper, said his daughter 'loved being a Sun Devil,' referring to ASU's athletic teams, and was on the Dean's List.

Becky Kasper, who had two sisters, was
 a native of Saint Cloud, Minnesota. She graduated from Northfield 
Senior High School in 2011.

'This is like lightning out of the clear blue sky, we had no idea that this was coming,' said the victim's father, Dan Kasper, according to CBS5 AZ.

Appearing dressed in a black ASU Sun Devils T-shirt, Mr Kasper said his daughter, described as a tough and focused young woman, loved Arizona, where the family had briefly lived when she was a child.

ASU was the only school the 19-year-old had applied to, even though Kasper said he was always unease about his daughter moving so far away from home.

Becky Kasper loved shopping and cats. She was pursuing a degree in marketing from the W.P. Carey School of Business, and was planning to graduate a year early.

The family were trying to get Miss Kasper to move back to Arizona, and her father said the last phone conversation they had before she was killed was about internship opportunities he had found for her.

But the 19-year-old informed her dad that she loved Arizona, and that her future was there.

No warning signs: Mr Kasper said he met Soltero over Christmas, and he seemed laid back and nice

'She's our daughter, and I just think her story is worth telling,' the emotional Mr Kasper told reporters, adding that Becky was likely going to do something great.

The bereaved father also said that he met Soltero before when Becky brought him home to Minnesota to spend Christmas with her family.

'He was quiet, laid back and easy going, seemed like a good kid,' he said.

The couple met last fall while working for Southwest Books, a door-to-door sales program.

According to Becky Kasper's dad, she told him that their relationship came to an end a few weeks ago, but that Soltero did not seem upset by it and took the breakup in stride.

At around 10.30am Tuesday morning, the 22-year-old Soltero walked into a Tempe Police Department substation, handed an officer his ID card and Kasper's Minnesota driver's license and stated: 'My girlfriend is there and she is dead, and I am not going to tell you anything more without an attorney,' according to the court papers cited by Phoenix News Times.

Soltero was then hospitalized with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning after telling police he felt dizzy because he had spent 12 hours in his car with the engine running inside a storage space.

Meanwhile, police officers went to Soltero and Kasper's home at 919 East Lemon Street in Tempe near the ASU campus, where the 22-year-old man said they would found his girlfriend’s body.

Responding officers forced open the door to the unit and found Kasper dead in the bathtub.

According to court documents, the 19-year-old's body was covered with blankets and a yoga mat, with coffee grounds and baking soda sprinkled on top.

The young woman’s head was covered 
with a plastic bag, and her face was described as 'unrecognizable' from 
horrific blunt-force trauma.

'It's a gruesome scene,' Tempe Police Sgt Mike Pooley told the station KTAR.

Court
 documents indicate that Becky Kasper's wrists were handcuffed and her 
ankles were restrained, and there was blood splatter in the tub, on the 
walls and floor. The rest of the woman's body was beginning to decay.

A blood-covered dumbbell, believed to be the murder weapon, was found on the bathroom floor.

Next to the dumbbell, police discovered an unsigned note wedged into the bathroom doors which read in part: 'I did not treat her right. She deserved better but never accepted it. So I had to make the choice for her.'

The author of the rambling missive goes on to say: 'She died on 420 not because of drugs, but because a sociopath talked and treated her nice...I don't know where to go from here. Do I kill again, end it with myself or become invisible.'

Police say the note was penned in handwriting consistent with Soltero's, according to the documents.

Neighbors told police that Soltero and Kasper had a stormy relationship and often could be heard screaming at one another.

The
 leasing office recently had to replace the front door in Soltero's apartment 
after it was damaged during a fight between the couple.  

The 19-year-old victim's employer told 
officials she often came to work with bruises on her arms as if someone 
grabbed her, although she had never reported domestic abuse.

Investigators later learned that Soltero and Kasper had recently split up, but were still spending a lot of time together, documents state.

A search of Soltero's apartment yielded a handwritten list of 'pros and cons' of 'breaking up with Becky.'

On Tuesday afternoon, Soltero was 
transferred from the hospital to the Tempe Police Department, where he 
asked an officer: 'Do they still have final meals on death row? I was 
wondering if I can order something from Texas,' according to court 
documents.

Soltero was charged with first-degree premeditated murder and ordered held on $1million bond.

Photos on Kasper's Facebook page depict the dark-haired, smiling young woman cuddling with her cat, having fun with her girlfriend on prom night and skydiving.

In one of the images posted on her page in December, a grinning, rosy-cheeked Becky Kasper could be seen happily posing with Soltero against the background of a winter wonderland scene.

Her mother wrote in the comments section at the time: 'Now that is a good looking couple!'
