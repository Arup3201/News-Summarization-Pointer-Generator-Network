Steve Jobs famously once said that if a company makes a stylus for a tablet, then 'they blew it'.

So, the late Apple co-founder wouldn't have been impressed with the latest plans for the firm's so-called super tablet - the iPad Pro.

An analyst believes that, following a wave of Apple patents hinting at a smart pen, the firm could launch a stylus by the second quarter of this year.

An analyst believes that following a wave of Apple patents (example pictured) over the past five years, which each referenced a stylus-style device, the firm could finally launch the pen by the second quarter of this year. The claims were made by Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities to Apple Insider

The claims were made by Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities to Apple Insider.  

'A stylus can be more convenient to use than the combination of keyboard and mouse in some cases,' said Mr Kuo. 

'Therefore, we believe Apple's stylus will improve the user experience of 12.9-inch iPad.'

Apple’s Newton platform originally came with a stylus when it launched in the 1990s. 

And the trend took off with the launch of the PalmPilot. 

But, at the 2008 Macworld event, Steve Jobs slated the stylus. 

He said: 'Who wants a stylus? You have to get ‘em, put ‘em away, you lose ‘em, yuck. Nobody wants a stylus.'

He added: 'So let's not use a stylus. 

'We're going to use the best pointing device in the world. 

'We're going to use a pointing device that we're all born with - born with ten of them. 

We're going to use our fingers. We're going to touch [the iPhone] with our fingers.'

He later said that any company that uses a stylus for a tablet had 'blown it.' 

Recent patents include 'Input Device Having Extendable Nib', awarded in March 2014, and 'Stylus Adapted For Low Resolution Touch Sensor Panels' in January 2010. 

In fact, Apple has filed more than 22 separate patents for a smart pen, dubbed iPen. 

Last February, one patent in particular featured detachable modules including a camera, audio recorder, laser pointer, power source and more.

Other functions detailed in the patent include a communication circuit, gyroscope and accelerometer. 

However, Mr Kuo said he doesn't expect Apple's debut stylus to have these features. 

Instead, the company will add them gradually over the coming years, or users could choose which features they wanted. 

And he expects 3D handwriting to be featured on later models, too.

These could be called 'expansion models', and were hinted at in the February iPen patent. 

Early iPen patents, dating back to May 2012, featured just a speaker and haptic feedback. Although basic stylus patents first appeared in 2010.

This haptic feature would make the iPen vibrate as it moves around the screen, to tell a user they’ve performed a certain action.

Apple has filed more than 22 separate patents for the so-called smart iPen, since 2012. Although basic stylus patents first appeared in 2010. In February last year, one such patent included images of a 'modular stylus'. Each module is shown having a different function including a camera, recorder, laser pointer, and more

Early iPen patents featured just a speaker and haptic feedback. A separate patent (pictured) added orientation features in which the iPen would draw different lines depending on the angle it was being held at. This means users could change the thickness or style of a line, or make writing more closely resemble their own

Samsung already makes a smart stylus for use with its own products, in particular the Galaxy Note range, known as the S Pen. 

The
 tip of this stylus is designed to mimic the touch of a finger touch, 
yet it will also work even when its hovered about the screen, adding 
what Samsung calls a 'magic wand' effect.

Double-tapping the pen on the screen opens a post-it-style note, while pressing the tip activates the S Pen menu.

Apple began filing patents for the so-called iPen back in 2012. 

For example, if the stylus was used with a drawing program or app, the feedback would be designed to mimic a brush or pencil.

A separate patent added orientation features in which the iPen would draw different lines depending on the angle it was being held at.

This means users could change the thickness or style of a line, or make writing more closely resemble their own. 

Samsung already offers a smart stylus, called the S Pen, designed to boost productivity on the Galaxy Note 4.

Name: Popular suggestions for the name of the tablet include  iPad Air Plus - taking its lead from Apple's iPhone 6 Plus, and the iPad Pro.

Size: The tablet is rumoured to have a 12.2- inch screen, although other dimensions up to 12.9 inches have also been suggested.

Rumours suggest it will be just 7mm thick.

Design: The leaked 'sketch' suggests that the iPad Air Plus will be similar in design to the iPad Air 2, with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges.

USP: The image differs from the smaller tablet however, because of grilles on the top of the shell, which suggest the device will include stereo speakers, as rumoured.

Launch: Sources have suggested different launch times, but there is some consensus the tablet may make its debut before the summer.

Rumours about an upcoming Apple 'super' tablet have been gaining traction recently after at least two images were leaked that appeared to show the device.

One photo of a mould was reportedly taken at Apple manufacturer Foxconn's factory in China and is said to measure approximately 12 inches high by 8.7 inches wide.

It follows a leaked sketch from earlier in the month that claimed to show one corner of the so-called megapad, iPad Pro or iPad Air Plus.

The latest image was posted on Chinese social network Weibo. 

If the rumours are true, the iPad Pro would be significantly larger than the current iPad Air 2. 

Experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height, 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep (305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm). 

Mr Kuo said he doesn't expect Apple's debut stylus to have a range of smart features. Instead, Apple will add them gradually, or users could choose which ones they wanted. Another patent for an Apple stylus is shown

In particular, the stylus could be used with Apple's rumoured 'super' tablet, dubbed iPad Pro (leaked mould pictured). Experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height, 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep (305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm)

Apple's iPad Pro is expected to have either a 12.2-inch or 12.9-inch display. A stylus (patent image pictured) could help productivity on the giant tablet

By comparison, the iPad Air 2 is 9.4 inches by 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches (240mm x 169.5mm x 6.1mm). 

The iPad Air 2 has a 9.7-inch display, while the iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 12.2-inch screen. 

This would put the Pro on par with Samsung's 12.2-inch Galaxy Note Pro, which launched in February.

The leaked sketch, also reportedly taken by an employee who works at Foxconn seemed to show a grille that will also boast four speakers for stereo sound.

The image was released by French website Nowhere Else, which has previously leaked details  from unannounced smartphones and Apple gadgets which proved to be true, citing a Foxconn source.

The source said that initial testing for the iPad Air Plus was stopped in the summer and Apple’s suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet.
