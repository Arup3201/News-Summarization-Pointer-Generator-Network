A puppy allegedly left for dead after being punched and struck with a shovel is recovering after police rescued her from underneath two feet of snow.

Bronx residents say they watched in shock as Raul Cruz, 43,  punched, kicked and beat his 6-month-old brindle pit bull mix Hennessy with a shovel Thursday before burying her under a snowbank.

The New York Daily News reports that when police responded early Friday morning after a neighbor heard Hennessy whimpering, officers found only her snout sticking out from the snow.

Dogged determination: Hennessy, a six-month-old puppy rescued from under a snowbank after being allegedly beaten by her owner, is struggling to hang on

'We had to physically dig her out of the snow,' said Sgt Derek Mercado, a dog owner himself, who was troubled by the sight he saw when he arrived shortly before 3a.m.

'She was crying and she was actually trying to pull herself out as we were digging,' Mercado continued. 'As soon as we got enough room for her to get out, she popped right out and ran right up to me.'

Court documents state that Cruz kicked, beat and threw Hennessy around in the yard behind his Longwood apartment.Hennessy around the yard. 

Residents said Cruz took the dog into a shed, from which residents heard 'yells and animal like screaming,' according to court documents.

According to the New York Post, witnesses showed police a recorded of the beating and said it wasn't the first time Cruz had abused the dog.

Officers took Hennessy back to the station house, where the starving pup gobbled down food police offered her, then transferred her to an emergency animal hospital.

Hennessy wound up with the ASPCA and a veterinarian who treated her said she had fractures to her skull, legs, ribs and back, and said she'd lost a few teeth, according to court documents.

'It seemed like something was wrong with her back legs,'  Mercado said to the Daily News. 'When we got her out, I knew that we had to do whatever we could to catch this guy.'

Police found Cruz nearby and arrested him on charges of aggravated animal cruelty, along with weapons possession and torturing and not feeding an animal.

He was held on $5,000 bail Friday, which officials said a relative posted.

Neighbors said they hoped that Cruz would be punished for the alleged abuse. 

'He’s an idiot to do something like that,' neighbor Dave Brown said. 'The dog can’t fight back. How are you going to beat up a dog like that?'
