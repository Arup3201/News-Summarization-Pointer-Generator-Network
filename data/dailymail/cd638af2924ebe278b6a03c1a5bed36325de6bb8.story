A rap music aficionado has made the first hip hop history walking tour of New York City.

Artist Jay Shells has erected signs bearing song lyrics about the city by New York rappers like Nas, Jay Z and the late Guru in the locations to which they refer.

He said: 'It’s an homage to New York hip hop. New York City is the birthplace of hip-hop and if any place deserve this historical map of sorts, it’s New York.'

'Ain't nothin nice': This sign, featuring a lyric from Where I'm From by Jay Z, is part of artist Jay Shells' unofficial hip hop history walking tour of New York City

106 and Park: Shells calls his project 'an homage to New York hip hop'. The city is where the poetic musical form was first developed in the late Seventies and early Eighties. This line is from Kanye West's All Falls Down

The unofficial project involved Shells and helpers from the website Animal New York putting up signs quoting rap artists like Busta Rhymes, KRS One, Kanye West, Jeru tha Damaja and various members of the Wu Tang Clan in the locations their lyrics describe.

He spent last weekend putting up more than 30 of the official looking signs across New York neighbourhoods immortalised in the poetic musical genre.

For example, this lyric from Cam'ron's Bout It Bout It: 'I represent where them killers at 145th and Broadway you get your head cracked.'

That quote is now featured on a red and white sign at the very spot it talks about - although 'the killers' are, thankfully, nowhere to be seen.

'Blacker than midnight': Shells spent last weekend putting up more than 30 of the official looking signs across New York districts immortalised in rap songs. Mos Def spoke this rhyme the track Mathematics

4th Street Park: Heavy D uttered this rhyme on the track Get Fresh Hev

It is not the first time that Shells has taken it upon himself to educate New Yorkers with a string of unofficial signs.

He erected a string of 'Metropolitan Etiquette Authority' signs in 2011 asking his fellow city-dwellers to 'Pay attention while walking' and 'Pull up your pants', among other imperatives.

One squarely aimed at the NYPD's mounted officers commanded them to 'Clean up after your horse'.

But the latest project eschews such moral judgements to instead mark out the territories made famous across the world by New York's most influential artistic export.

Shells, a lifelong New Yorker, told the New York Daily News he became interested in hip hop's descriptions of his home town after ruminating on a line from Big L's verse on the 1995 track Lifestyles Ov Da Poor and Dangerous.

'On 139 and Lennox Ave. there’s a big park, and if you’re soft don’t go through it when it gets dark,' the lyrics go.

'Drug associated since the 70s, word': Shells is seen carrying a step ladder walking away from a sign featuring a lyric from Lil Fame on M.O.P.'s track Brownsville

'Where them killers at': This line is from the Cam'ron track Bout It Bout It

'You try bust your gat and keep it real but you nameless': Prodigy's words from the last verse of Mobb Deep's Give Up The Goods

'Hear it when I get biz for K-Von': Kool G Rap's words from For Da Brothaz

Shells said: 'There are so many blocks that get called out in songs but a block can be huge.

'A corner or venue is a place where you can put a stake in the ground and say, "This is mentioned". But it’s really specific locations, a place where you could put a brass plaque in the ground and say, "This happened here".

'That’s the reason I did the project, for that feeling for someone that might be walking by, and that person didn’t know that where they’re standing, that particular point, is mentioned in a song.'

'I claim the whole planet cuz it's mine goddamnit': This line is taken from Showbiz and AG's track Next Level

Poignant: This lyric from Big L's 1995 track Lifestyles Ov Da Poor And Dangerous appears on a sign just yards from where the rapper was gunned down four years later

The project is ongoing, but Shells has set himself a few limits. The location must a very specific corner, park or establishment, and only one quote per rapper will go up.

As yet he as another nine signs left to erect across the city, and is taking suggestions from friends and strangers on Twitter for other lyrics to post.

As the tough-guy lyrics suggest, not every location is safe. Indeed, Lamont Coleman, better known as Big L, was in 1999 shot dead on 139th street, yards from the park he four years earlier boasted is dangerous after dark.
