Rescue crews were scouring the north of San Francisco Bay for a missing pilot after two small vintage planes collided while heading home from a show, sending one crashing into the water while the other miraculously managed to land.

Debris was found in San Pablo Bay after the 4.05pm collision near the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, but the pilot has still not been found, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Loumania Stewart.

The mid-air crash involved a single engine 1965 Cessna 210 and a World War Two era Hawker Sea Fury TMK 20, piloted by a husband and wife crew, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor.

The Cessna crashed into the water and the Sea Fury's pilot was able to land 40 minutes later at Eagle's Nest Airport in the small Northern California city of Ione, Gregor said.

Amador County firefighters and medics sent to the Ione airport were not needed because the pilot and passenger in the Sea Fury - a husband and wife - were not injured, the county's Undersheriff Jim Wegner said.

Both planes had departed from Eagle's Nest Airport to participate in the Pacific Coast Dream Machines, an annual festival in Half Moon Bay that features a variety of planes, motorcycles, and cars.

Both planes left Half Moon Bay Airport, about 20 miles south of San Francisco, and were on their return flight to Ione.

Witnesses at Point San Pablo Yacht Harbor told the San Francisco Chronicle that the Cessna spiraled out of control and crashed into the choppy water after the collision.

'Everyone associated with the Pacific Coast Dream Machines Show is terribly saddened by this news and we hope and pray the missing plane and survivors are found,' the event organizers said in a statement.

Four Coast Guard boats and a helicopter searched the choppy bay waters, along with five boats from local law enforcement agencies, including the Marin County Sheriff's Office and the Sausalito Police Department, as well as a local helicopter.

'It clipped a wing, probably lost a wing, spun violently and hit the water,' said witness Eric Johnson to KTVU.

'Tragic. The plane spinning that hard, you can't jump out, you can't get away. It's really sad.'

Divers from the San Francisco Police Department also were on the scene.

Wegner wouldn't discuss damage to the Sea Fury, citing the ongoing investigation by the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board.

The names of the pilots involved have not been released as of Monday morning.

Search: Rescuers are now searching the San Pablo Bay near San Francisco for the second plane involved in the collision

Classic aircraft: This is a Hawker Sea Fury TMK 20 - a British fighter jet used in the Second World War and the Korean War - a model like this was involved in a mid-air collision over San Francisco Bay on Sunday

The British Hawker aircraft, named Dreadnought, was one of the featured aircraft at the Pacific Coast Dream Machines event in Half Moon Bay on Sunday - which annually showcases a variety of planes, motorcycles, vintage cars and other customized vehicles.

The Hawker is famed for its racing pedigree and is registered to Sanders Aircraft Ince, which restores classic airplanes and is operated by brothers Dennis and Brian Sanders.

The plane was rebuilt by their father, Frank Sanders, who died in a 1989 plane crash.

Sanders Aeronautics' website said the family-run company specializes in aircraft restoration and brothers Dennis and Brian Sanders are avid air racers.
