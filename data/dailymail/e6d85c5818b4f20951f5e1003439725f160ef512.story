England all-rounder Moeen Ali stirred up an extraordinary altercation between cricket and religious chiefs by wearing his ‘Free Palestine’ and ‘Save Gaza’ wristbands during the third Test against India.

Ali, a committed Muslim, was warned by the match referee not to wear them again as this would be seen as making political, religious or racial statements during matches.

But senior Rabbi Yisroel Fine of Cockfosters was so enraged by Ali’s political stance in support of Gaza that he phoned England Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke to complain.

Controversy: Moeen Ali's wristbands got him in trouble with the Match Referee but not the ECB

Backing his man: ECB chairman Giles Clarke clashed with a London Rabbi over the incident 

There then followed a very heated exchange with both parties reportedly shocked by the rudeness and aggression being used by the other.

Clarke gave his full backing to Ali, saying there was no way he would interfere with a player wanting to express his opinions.

As a result Rabbi Fine, a cricket-lover who has retired from his synagogue leadership, is considering quitting his membership of the MCC, although Clarke has no part in its running.

Meanwhile, Ian Bell, chosen to speak to the media after Ali’s wristband protest, was briefed that he would probably be asked questions about Gaza.

‘Who’s Gaza?’ responded Bell.

It is expected that a big newspaper serialisation of Kevin Pietersen’s much-awaited autobiography will begin in the same week as the October 9 date of publication of the book by Little, Brown. 

The England Cricket Board, who haven’t handled their KP divorce case well, are said to have a PR strategy in place ahead of KP’s launch day in order to neuter the news value of his revelations about his falling out with England captain Alastair Cook and coach Andy Flower. 

War of words: England are preparing themselves for KP's autobiography which will be published in October

But it’s being kept under wraps, so as not to alert the KP camp.

Ronnie Irani, former Essex cricketer and talkSPORT breakfast show host, was involved in a confrontation with a drunken heckler in Manchester. 

Police intervened when the drunk smashed his fist on the bonnet of Irani’s car.

The incident took place next to where a Maserati was parked. It was assumed by the crowd that the super sports car with the personalised IRAN number plate was indeed Ronnie’s. 

However, Irani, who now sells customised insoles after leaving talkSPORT, was driving an Audi.

Eric Harrison, coach of Manchester United’s Class of ’92, hasn’t lost his will to win at the age of 76. 

Harrison made clear to former pupils Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers at half-time in their 5-1 charity match defeat by their own Salford City that they were underperforming and letting down the 12,000 crowd. 

Robbie Savage, another product of that United class, played so poorly up front that Gary Neville called him ‘Railings’ — because the ball kept bouncing back off him.

Neville looks a stayer

Phil Neville explained during a lunchtime interview with Jonathan Agnew on Test Match Special on Friday how he quickly recovered from that nightmare first co-commentary on England v Italy in Manaus to land a full portfolio of BBC football roles, suggesting he has the mental resolve to become a successful analyst.

Back for good: Phil Neville will continue to work for the BBC despite a difficult start to his broadcasting career

Meanwhile, Agnew, the BBC’s voice of cricket, is turning his talents in other directions with the Beeb making him their equestrian, dressage and showjumping expert for the Olympics in Rio and giving him time to learn about the new sports.

International law firm Stephenson Harwood are now representing former Leeds CEO David Haigh, who has been held without charge in a Dubai jail since May 18 following his falling out with former Leeds owners GFH Capital. 

Haigh’s bank accounts have been frozen, but his new lawyers will freeze payments until Haigh can pay. Former Leeds owner Ken Bates is not involved in paying any of Haigh’s legal fees.
