A teenage lacrosse player was caught by his coach sneaking on board a plane early was forced to read a lengthy apology to the plane’s passengers.

Mac Breedlove appeared hesitant before delivering the apology, but was coached by a Southwest flight attendant to stand front and centre and face those that he’d wronged.

The entire blustering, uncomfortable apology of the Texas teenager is caught on camera.

Mea culpa: Mac Breedlove, a Texas high school lacrosse player on a flight with his team, was forced to apologise after cutting the queue

Deep regret: He addressed a cabin full of passengers on Southwest while a flight attendant holds the PA system

Captive audience: A cabin full of people listened to the teen's written apology

Standing in the front of the fuselage with a backwards hat and a sheepish smile, Breedlove began his speech. The flight attendant held up the PA system while he read.

‘My fellow travellers,’ he began, ’today I address you with great remorse. During the boarding process, I took advantage of this airline’s kindness.’

He said that while some of his teammates were called to the front of the queue, Breedlove was not among them, but went ahead anyways.

‘This is not the way my coaches, teammates, or parents expect me to behave, and for all of this, I apologise.’ 

The story was first reported by CBSNews.com, which also provided video of Breedlove's apology.

Throughout the teen’s speech, those in the cabin booed when he confessed to his actions, and cheered when he apologises.

Contrite: He concluded with: 'I am just a young man that thinks I¿m smarter than I am'

Fin: He bashfully walked back to his seat after completing the apology

‘I hope you will all find it in your hearts to forgive me, for I am just a young man that (sic) thinks I’m smarter than I am.

'Enjoy your flight,' he concluded, 'and remember to fly Southwest, because they let my coach do this to me.’

Many of the passengers seemed to be in good humour over it and applauded him as he made his way down the aisle to his seat.

And one thing is for certain – one red-faced lacrosse player will not be jumping the queue anytime soon.
