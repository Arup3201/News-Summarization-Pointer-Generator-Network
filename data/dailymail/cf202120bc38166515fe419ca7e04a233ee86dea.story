A terrified widow called for a priest 
to cleanse her ‘evil’ house after she claims to have seen her dead 
husband appear on her bedroom wall.

Andrea Samuels said the strange shape on her wall and ceiling is her husband Brian, who died four years ago.

The 41-year-old also claims her dead dog is calling for her beyond the grave in the bathroom of her Carlisle home.

She called for Catholic priest Father Paul Dadson who used holy water to cleanse the property on Wednesday.

Father Dadson, of St Bede’s Catholic 
Church, confirmed the patches in the bedroom resembled a man and said 
there was also a figure in the ceiling which resembled part of an 
animal.

Andrea, who believes the animal in her
ceiling is her dead boxer Hoob, said her house has been the scene of 
numerous inexplicable events.

She claims brand new furniture has 
broken, pictures have fallen off walls and that she has suffered 
personal problems since the images first appeared.

Andrea also believes that one of her pet birds, the aptly named 'Spirit', flew away after getting caught up in all the strange happenings. Her second bird, Spook, is now the only one that is left.

Andrea, who was described as being in 
‘good psychological and emotional health’ by the priest, said: ‘I used 
to have a beautiful house and it just went.’

Upon his arrival, Father Dadson scattered holy water around the building, blessed it and said some prayers.

The end-of-terrace home in Carlisle where Miss Samuels has lived for ten years. Her husband died four years ago and a priest has now been summoned to cleanse the property

He arrived in Carlisle in January after working as a priest in Botswana and his native Nigeria for 13 years.

He said this is the second time he has had to carry out this kind of spiritual cleansing in the city.

He said: ‘I was there and saw 
something on the wall which looked to me like some kind of image.

'From a
distance it appeared like the figure of a man.

‘In some houses things have been done,
maybe people have carried out some kind of sacrifice or other activity 
that influences people with the forces of evil.’

Andrea, who has lived in her Carlisle 
home for ten years, now hopes the blessing will help her to move on with
her life and says it has helped her discover her religious faith.
