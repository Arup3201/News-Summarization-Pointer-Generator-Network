Harry Allen's eyes dim when he digs into the memory bank and talks about the look on his parents’ faces. Their immediate reaction to the news, he says, was one of the most painful moments of his 12-month ban for cocaine abuse.

‘It’s quite weird to relive it because I’ve tried to bury it,’ said Allen, 23, speaking publicly for the first time since his suspension ended with him playing his first game for his new club London Irish last weekend. ‘My dad is my biggest fan. I drove home and told my mum, then waited for my dad to get in from work.

‘I broke down a bit. When it all falls on top of you, you think, “I’ve potentially ruined my life here”. It reduces you to such a low level, you think, “Wow”. I won’t forget the look on my dad’s face when I told him. That’s enough for me to not ever do anything that stupid again.’

Harry Allen is determined to make the most of his second chance at London Irish after a year-long drug ban

Allen made his Premiership return for the Exiles last weekend against Saracens 

The England age-group hooker received the results of his positive test on December 19, 2013, his 22nd birthday. Then at Harlequins, Allen was called into a meeting after training with club coaching staff and an anti-doping officer, who revealed that benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, was present in his results. The one-year ban began immediately and Quins had no option but to release him.

‘It was a test after an A League semi-final,’ said Allen. ‘It was quite a bad time. I had my contract terminated on my birthday, then Christmas was really weird and I was in a bit of a void. After Christmas it dies down a bit and you think, “I’ve made a really, really bad mistake”. 

'You talk about embarrassment but it was more a feeling that I let people down. I definitely let my mum and dad down, and my family. Quins as well; I let Conor [O’Shea] and all them guys down.’

Between the initial drugs test and the start of the suspension, Allen had made his first-team debut for the west London club. Having played previously for Saracens and England Under-18s, his career seemed to be set on an upward trajectory. He does not come across as the ‘party animal’ type but says he turned to the drug because of ‘personal issues outside the game’, despite being fully aware of the repercussions. He will not explain further.

Now 23, Allen took to mixed martial arts during his time away from rugby and says is provided him with focus

‘When I got tested, I knew,’ said Allen. ‘It was out of character for me [to take drugs]. It wasn’t something that appealed to me in any way; it was just something that happened. Straight after I knew exactly what I’d done. I beat myself up quite badly. it wasn’t a habit.’

It was the buzz of competition that provided Allen with his real highs. Torn away from his love for rugby with a suspension that did not even permit training, the youngster from Kent took up mixed martial arts. Former England prop Matt Stevens, who previously served a two-year ban for cocaine use, started Brazilian jiu-jitsu during his time out but Allen found comfort in cage fighting.

He said: ‘The MMA gave me something to focus on. Some people may go missing and take loads of time off but I knew from the start that I made a mistake and needed to keep my head right. It was hard, a dark place.

‘There’s a lot more to MMA than just being a man, hitting people hard and having a fight. I wasn’t too bad, considering 10 months in I got to the semi-pro level.

'I fought for a light-heavyweight title. I lost by a split decision but it was important to me, just to really bring home that I really went for something that year. I never sat there and felt sorry for myself.’

While Allen was banned for the recreational drug use, he questions claims that rugby’s culture encourages the use of performance enhancing substances. There is increasing pressure on young players to bulk up to meet the physical demands of the game but Allen’s perception is that sufficient levels of education are in place.

‘Everyone is getting bigger and stronger but there are teams in place to help you achieve that naturally,’ he said. ‘The people who do that [take drugs] are the people who don’t want to work hard and want to take short cuts.’

Cage fighting kept Allen in shape and he was given a lucky break by London Irish.

The Exiles asked him to play for the club’s reserves before, in a series of ‘honest’ conversations, he convinced director of rugby Brian Smith that he had overcome his problems.

‘I got a phone call from [former lock] Nick Kennedy,’ said Allen. ‘He said, “We’re short on hookers, do you fancy coming and playing an A League game for us?”. I jumped at the chance. My ban was up on the Saturday and I was back playing at a very good standard on the Monday.

‘Before that I was looking at playing National One for Blackheath or something along those lines. I was prepared to start at the bottom and work my way up.’

Irish found themselves with extensive injury problems and signed Allen on a week-by-week contract. He says he was treated like any other member of the squad on his return, with his new team-mates recognising the willingness to own up to his mistakes. Now he feels he is back on the right path.

‘I want to be a Premiership hooker and all the dreams I had as a kid are very much on my mind,’ he said. ‘Perhaps before I lost that hunger, but now I’ve got that hunger to do what I need to do.’
