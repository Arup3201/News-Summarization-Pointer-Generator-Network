Nasa has begun testing models of a 'son of Concorde' aircraft - a passenger plane that would travel faster than the speed of sound.

The supersonic aircraft, which has been designed by The Boeing Company, is hoping to fill the gap left by Concorde when it was retired in November 2003.

At the moment, commercial supersonic planes are not allowed to fly over land because of the noise created by sonic booms.

This artist's impression of a supersonic aircraft shows what the final model may look like.

 1976 - The year the first commercial Concorde flight took place. The first test flights of Concorde happened years earlier, in 1969.

250mph - The speed at which Concorde took off.

2.5 million - The number of passengers that flew Concorde.

204ft - The length of Concorde. This length expanded between six and ten inches during flights because of heat on the airframe.

4 - The number of Concorde engines.

28, 238
- The number of miles Concorde covered when it flew around the world in
November 1986. It took 29 hours and 59 minutes to complete this trip.

The tests being carried out at Nasa's Glenn Research Center in Ohio are trying to establish whether the volume of these sonic booms can be reduced.

A photo of Nasa's latest test, taken through a window in the sidewall of Nasa's supersonic wind tunnel in Cleveland, shows a 1.79 percent scale model of the aircraft.

Boeing has been tight-lipped on the details of the aircraft.

Researchers tested the performance of air inlets situated on the top of the model to see whether changing the amount of airflow at supersonic speeds affected the aircraft's performance, emissions and noise levels.

The researchers controlled the flow of air through the inlets using a remote-controlled device.

The device sits in the inlet on the right-hand side of the plane - the pilot's side. 

These tests are part of ongoing research as part of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate.

The directorate is looking at ways of making future supersonic flight over land possible, as well as developing green aviation, which looks to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

Similar tests are being carried out at Nasa's Langley Research Center in Virginia.

The models being tested use technologies including the F-100-like propulsion system, a tail blister, and varying shapes, combined to achieve a lower target perceived decibel level.

If tests are successful, it could lead to the development of the first commercial supersonic passenger plane since Concorde.

Concorde's maiden commercial flight was on 21 January 1976.

It flew regularly from London Heathrow and Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport to New York and Washington.

Concorde's first commercial flight was in 1976. It flew regularly from London to New York, before it was retired in 2003.

Flights from London to New York took just three and a half hours, compared to the eight hours it takes to fly there on subsonic planes.

In 1986, Concorde flew around the world covering 28,238 miles in just 29 hours and 59 minutes.

On 25 July 2000, Concorde crashed into a hotel in Gonesse, France, killing all passengers and crew, as well as four bystanders.

It was the only fatal accident, and the aircraft was retired three years later. It's last commercial journey was made on 24 October 2003 from New York to London.
