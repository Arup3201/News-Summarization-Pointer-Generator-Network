Cristiano Ronaldo insists he is fit to lead Portugal against Germany tonight.

If he is on song then Portugal, who are 25-1 outsiders to win tournament, could emerge from the pack.

There is not a lot more than can be said about the world footballer of the year, who has been quite stunning over the last few years at Real Madrid.

Ready: Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo insists he is ready to face Germany in Salvador

But in case you didn’t know, Ronaldo was named after US president Ronald Regan and his timed 'kick speed' is around 130 kilometres an hour, which is 31.1metres per second.

That's more than four times that of Apollo 11 rocket's launching speed, which was the first rocket flight that landed man on the moon. So he really is Rocket Ronnie!

Those coaches from the Premier League who are out in Brazil on scouting missions should get down to Curitiba for the clash between Iran and Nigeria.

Iran have a 19-year-old wonderkid called Sardar Azmoun, who has been dubbed the 'Iranian Messi'. Currently with Rubin Kazan in Russia, he has already attracted the attention of Arsenal.

Iran boss Carlos Queiroz will be looking for a job at a Premier League or Championship club next season.

Queiroz, who Sir Alex Ferguson rated as the best of his assistant managers at Manchester United, will leave after the finals because the Iran FA can no longer afford his £2million-a-year wages.

Could Emmanuel Emenike become Nigeria’s Paolo Rossi?

In 1982 Rossi returned to Italy after a long ban for an alleged betting scandal and became top scorer with six goals as he led the Azzurri to victory.

Two years ago Emenike was in exile in the wake of match fixing allegations in Turkey, but back at Fernerbahce last season he hit 12 goals.

Nigeria are unlikely to go all the way in Brazil but Emenike could be a Golden Boot dark horse, especially if he gets off to a flyer against Iran.

Daniel Sturridge indulged in his brand of funky dance celebration when he scored for England against Italy but if Ghana notch against the USA then the Liverpool striker’s moves will look rather stilted.

Even during training sessions the Ghana players have been making a habit of collectively breaking out in traditional dance and song known as Azonto. Some even do backflips.

Middlesbrough’s Albert Adomah said: 'If we score then everyone will break out into dance and song. It’s just spontaneous.'

Today’s clash against Portugal is Germany’s 100th at a World Cup - the most appearances of any nation. They have reached the final on seven occasions, the same amount as five-time winners Brazil. Germany have won the trophy on three occasions.

The Germany vs Portugal clash is so hard to call.

But
 given that Miroslav Klose is one short of Brazilian Ronaldo’s World Cup
 record of 15 goals at finals, the 36-year-old German deserves a tickle
 at 5-1 to be opening scorer.

Cristiano Ronaldo is also 5-1.

In some respects the 2-1 defeat to Italy has not affected England's perceived requirement to reach the knockout stage.  

Before England played Italy, the prevailing wisdom was that a solid opening draw against Andrea Pirlo and Co would leave Roy Hodgson’s men needing a point against Uruguay and a win against Costa Rica to make the last 16.

Thanks to Costa Rica's shock 3-1 win over Uruguay, the form book suggests that England now need a draw against Uruguay and a win against Costa Rica to make the last 16. 

Of course Costa Rica are no pushovers as they have proved, but often unfancied teams that come out of the blocks flying eventually falter at the final hurdle of the group.

And on the two occasions that England have lost their first games (in 1962 and 1986) they went on to reach the quarter-finals.

World Cup memory

This tournament has perhaps the strongest collection of African nations at a World Cup finals.

Pele once predicted an African team would win the World Cup at the turn of the 21st century. That breakthrough has yet to come and, despite their strength, Group G is tough group for Ghana to emerge from.

But the fact they are considered a threat to Germany and Portugal emphasises how much African football has progressed since Zaire were the first black African nation to make a finals.

Making history: Zaire, pictured here in action against Scotland during the 1974 World Cup, were the first African nation to compete at a finals

After losing 4-0 to Brazil and 2-0 Scotland they were trashed 9-0 by Yugoslavia. The Brazil game is best remembered for the mad moment when Zaire defender Mwepu Illunga rushed out from the wall and cleared a free-kick before Brazil had actually taken it.

Combined with that defeat to Yugoslavia, who needed a big win to progress at the expense of Scotland, Zaire did no favours for the image of African football.

But Cameroon, Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Ghana are all being taken very seriously this summer.
