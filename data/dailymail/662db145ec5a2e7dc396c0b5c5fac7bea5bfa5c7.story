Aljaz Bedene, the Slovenian tennis player who wants to switch to Great Britain, faces both a bureaucratic wrangle and potential hostility from new compatriots if he wants to achieve his aim.

After more than a year weighing things up, the Hertfordshire-based world number 108 has decided he would like to go for full British status and one day represent GB in the Davis Cup.

But first he must secure a passport, not to mention convince other British players that he is not just carpetbagging, having played for Slovenia as recently as February 2012.

New arrival: Aljaz Bedene is yet to receive a British passport but his decision to apply has caused a stir

Dan Evans, the UK number two, quickly took to Twitter to express his disapproval of the idea, saying (before he deleted it) 'So a guy becoming British who has already played for his country, doesn’t sound right to me.'

The Lawn Tennis Association issued a non-commital statement: 'He is currently progressing with his citizenship application which will take some time, and in the meantime he will continue to base himself in Hertfordshire.'

Bedene could, theoretically, be available for GB’s opening World Group Davis Cup match next March, although sources suggest that is highly optimistic, and that it is possible he may not get a passport at all.

The 24 year-old has been ranked as high as 72 and, while unlikely to have a stellar career like another famous import Greg Rusedski, is a solid performer who looks to have a decent career in front of him.

He can play well on clay but has also had some decent results on grass while this year he reached the third round of the Sony Open in Miami on hard court. Currently injured with recurring wrist problems, he is expected to miss the French Open and concentrate on the grass court events that follow.

Ironically, in his most recent outing at a Challenger in Italy he lost to Britain’s leading prospect Kyle Edmund, but in theory he would slot in as British number two with his current ranking.

Bedene has based himself near Stevenage since 2011 and lives with his girlfriend Kimalie, a singer who is part of Slovenia’s answer to the Spice Girls, ‘Foxy Teens’.

Realistically it is hard to see him gaining consideration for Davis Cup play for at least a couple of years, and then he would have to fit in to what has become a tight-knit unit under captain Leon Smith.

Progress: The GB team that took on Italy in the Davis Cup quarter-final was the most successful for decades

Imports: Konta (far left) is the current women's number three while Rusedski (right) enjoyed a stella career

While tennis is hardly unique among British sports in accepting incomers it has had its share over the past 20 years. Olympic silver medallist Neil Broad from South Africa and current women’s number three Jo Konta have been high profile examples, with 1997 U.S Open finalist Greg Rusedski the most prominent of all.

The most recent was Australian Brydan Klein, who qualifies through an English mother, although his career remains stuck in neutral. Novak Djokovic once contemplated trying to qualify on residency, tempted by such things as assistance from the LTA and potentially lucrative sponsorships, although he eventually thought better of it.

The process is rarely smooth although Rusedski is someone who has stayed around and, more than fifteen years on, become very much part of the British scene.
