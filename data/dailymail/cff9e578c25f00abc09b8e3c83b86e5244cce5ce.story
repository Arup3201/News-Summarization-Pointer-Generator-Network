Five wolf pups abandoned by their parents during a huge wildfire in Alaska have been rescued and taken to Anchorage Zoo.

On Tuesday, firefighters battling the Funny River blaze on the Kenai Peninsula heard small yelps coming from a den and decided to investigate.

Inside they discovered five dehydrated wolf pups, who had all suffered a run-in with a porcupine, needing quills removed from their tiny bodies.

Steve Miller, deputy manager of the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, contacted the Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Jeff Selinger, who came to assist the firefighters.

However, when he arrived, Selinger was too big to fit in the 10-foot-deep den and a smaller volunteer was needed to slip inside.

Five pups - three males and two females - had been living on their own for two days, while sadly, another one had died prior to their rescue.

All the pups had porcupine quills sticking out of them and the first thing the rescuers did was give them sugar water through a pipette to hydrate them.

Later in the day, the Department of Fish and Game drove the pups to the Alaska Zoo in Anchorage, where the zoo's curator took them in.

'They would have died if we didn’t pull them out,' said firefighter Jefferson Sam to The Alaska Dispatch. 'For me, it was the right thing to do.'

Firefighter Brian Nichols told the Peninsula Clarion that caring for the pups was 'just like holding a dog'.

'They were hungry and trying to suckle on anything. It was just like holding a puppy, they’re so young they don’t know any better.'

Tired: The rescued wolf pups were transferred to Anchorage Zoo where they are currently being cared for

The sky above many portions of Kasilof glowed orange on Wednesday as the Funny River Fire continued to burn a more than a 10 mile strip of land stretching from Funny River Road in Soldotna down to Tustumena Lake

At Anchorage Zoo the pups spent all day Wednesday with the zoo veterinarian being fed puppy-milk replacement formula every few hours.

At two weeks old, the pups weighed 2.5 pounds, about a half-pound less than normal.

Some of the pups had developed abscesses and were put on antibiotics after being stuck with the quills.

Unfortunately, because they have been handled by humans they cannot be set back into the wild.

Plans are in progress to find them a good home.
