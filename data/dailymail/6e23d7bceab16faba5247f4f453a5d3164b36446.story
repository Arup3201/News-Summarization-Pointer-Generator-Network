With a new cookery book out every day with ever more weird and wacky recipes to excite Britain's budding chefs, we sometimes lose sight of the simple meals we enjoy the most.

One no-nonsense we user has gone back to basics to post a recipe for Marmite on toast on the BBC's Good Food website - sparking a wave of hilarious responses.

User Benno Himself posted the recipe two years ago but only in the past few days has it seen a surge of interest and comments from fellow BBC Good Food users who appreciate his sense of humour.

Twitter users have also gone mad for this amusing recipe.

User Benno Himself posted this recipe back in 2010 but has seen a revival in sarcastic and ironic comments

A surge in Twitter activity around the recipe may have been the cause for new comments

Anyone can sign up to the website in seconds and be posting recipes immediately, so as one can imagine the website is a minefield for joke (or very bad) recipes.

The step-by-step instructions for Marmite on toast go: 'put 
bread in toaster', 'get out butter and marmite [sic]', 'get toast out of toaster 
when done', 'spread butter on toast', 'spread marmite [sic] on toast', 'serve with 
bay leaf (optional)', and, 'eat it'.

There's really no arguing with this tried and tested technique for the perfect Marmite on toast.

It has even been rated an average five out of five stars. People are impressed.

Though on closer inspection, it appears some of the gushingly positive response to this recipe might be peppered with a hint of irony.

This amateur chef goes back to basics with his step by step guide to making this very simple dish

'This
is one of my personal favorites! The assemblage of this dish only took 
about 10 minutes despite drilling a hole in the middle of the bread with
my rock-solid unsalted butter. However it later turned out that the 
hole in the middle is the perfect vehicle for the bay leaf. Couldn't be 
more please with the outcome, hope you post something similar with 
marmalade and basil.' - Percy Jackson

Trying
to cut down carbs, so I tried this recipe without the toast. (omit 
steps 1 & 3.) A little messy to eat, but still delicious - grahamthecat

'Spread
the marmite on the toast' WITH WHAT!? It sticks to my fingers more than
the bread and my spatula doesn't fit in the jar! - clockworkchimp

I've
been using a fork to spread the butter but the toasted bread seams to 
break up, is there a special kitchen implement to spread butter? - Tim Messanger

This
looks great but as a hardworking unemployed layabout, I don't have time
for complicated recipes like this after a long day in the pub/down the 
bookies. Does anyone know if this is available as a ready-meal in any of
the supermarkets? - cmtarpey

This is a recipe my mother handed down to me, I've always been reluctant to do it as I was nervous it wouldn't taste as good as hers... no need for me to worry, turned out perfectly Thank You so much for bringing back some childhood memories. - Tilly

I'm not keen on turkey and was looking for an alternate for Christmas Day and I think this is it. - Smoz

Funny responses: 'Does anyone know if this is available as a ready meal in any of the supermarkets?

While all of a sudden new comments are starting to be posted on the website, there has also been a surge in Twitter activity.

Twitter users are jokingly tweeting that the recipe looks complicated, or that the comments are 'comedy genius'.

And they're not wrong.

User brisbaneroad today commented: 'A serious omission here is an accompaniment for the meal.

'As Marmite is made from brewer's yeast, a pint of best bitter would go well with this.

'Dinner party sorted!'

Meanwhile PJNev said: 'I'm going to give it a go... but I'm a bit stuck.

'Instructions on how to use the toaster needed!'
