Florida police were trying to discover what was killing cats in one Port St. Lucie neighborhood when they found out the culprit was a 12-foot long Burmese Python hiding in the brush.

Neighbors say the 120-pound snake has been getting fat on their kittens.

The huge python was spotted by Sgt. John Holman, who immediately called for backup after making the startling find.

This massive 12-foot long python was discovered in a Florida neighborhood after feasting on resident's cats

He was waist-high in the brush when he came across the massive snake.

'Once I saw the size of it, I called for a few more officers,' he told WPBF. 'I'm not going to do that by myself.'

Police tell CBS 12 the snake belongs to an unidentified local resident.

However no charges have yet been filed.

Officers say they believe they have found the owner of the snake through state permits, but no charges have yet been pressed

Though Florida law prohibits owning pythons, Holman said he has already identified one person who has a license and permission to keep a snake from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.

Neighbor Denise Keel, who lives next door to the property where the snake was discovered, said she is not surprised.

'I
 wondered what happened to all the little animals,' she said. 'Some of 
the neighbors had a couple of snakes that they kept in one of those 
aquarium things, and they've moved.'
