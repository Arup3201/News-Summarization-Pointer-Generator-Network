It seems Nick Clegg is not cut out for a life on the open wave.

After posing for the cameras as he joined commuters on board a river boat yesterday, the Deputy Prime Minister was back on terra firma this morning, ferried to work in the back of his ministerial limo.

Unfortunately for the Lib Dem leader, a photographer was also on hand to picture the moment an aide held the car door open for him outside his home in Putney.

On firm ground: The Deputy Prime Minister opted for a more traditional route to Whitehall this morning

With David Cameron still on his holidays in Portugal, Mr Clegg is the most senior minister in Whitehall.

Keen to get his time in charge of the country off to a flying start, yesterday he took to the water with wife Miriam, with the couple see gazing into 
each other’s eyes while other commuters paid little attention to the 
fact the Deputy Prime Minister was on board.

But luckily a photographer just happened to be there 
to record the ‘impromptu’ trip as the couple drank coffee and exchange loving glances.

At least in his open-neck shirt and 
expensive suit, Nick Clegg looked more at ease than David Cameron did on
Friday as he attempted the casual look on holiday in Portugal with wife
Samantha.

The Deputy Prime Minister and his wife Miriam, a lawyer, were returning to work yesterday after their own break in Spain.

Nailing it: Mr Clegg later tried his hand at hammering a tac into a sofa during a visit to to Forest Sofa Ltd In Salford.

Cheer up: The Lib Dem leader looked glum - maybe thinking about his fun boat ride yesterday

It
was the first time Mr Clegg has used the river bus for the half-hour 
commute from his home in Putney, South-West London, to his Westminster 
office.

But his ministerial
car still had to make the trip, to carry paperwork for the Liberal 
Democrat leader, who, Downing Street insists, is not running things as 
Mr Cameron ‘remains in charge’ – even on holiday.

Tomorrow Mr Clegg is expected to host the second of his new monthly 
press conferences, taking questions from journalists on any topic.

Bored boaters: Other commuters paid little attention to the Deputy PM as they travelled from Putney to Westminster

Lonely at the top: With David Cameron still on holiday in Portugal, Mr Clegg is the most senior government minister in Westminster

By
contrast Mr Cameron has faced criticism for not holding the 'take 
all-comers' press conferences which became routine under Tony Blair and 
Gordon Brown.

As millions of people battled through 
traffic jams or the crush on trains and buses, Mr Clegg looked relaxed 
as he boarded the boat from his family home in Putney to Westminster.

During
the half hour river journey the Cleggs enjoyed coffee from Costa – 
notably snubbing Starbucks which has faced criticism for its low tax 
bill in Britain.

Stepping out: The Cleggs were seen walking in the sunshine this morning while other commuters braved traffic jams and over-heated public transport

Rested: The couple have just returned from a week in Spain, where Miriam's family are from

Downing Street has repeatedly stressed that Mr Cameron 'remains in charge' wherever he is in the world.

But Mr Clegg has encouraged the idea that senior ministers 'hold the fort' when the PM is taking a break.

The two men faced criticism after it emerged they would both be out of the country at the same time
