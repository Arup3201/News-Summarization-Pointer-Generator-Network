They say that 40 is the new 30 - and one look at Jennifer Aniston confirms that.

The 43-year-old actress dazzled at the People's Choice awards earlier this month wearing a leather skater dress by Dior that a couple of decades ago would have been fashion fodder reserved for nubile twentysomethings.

Of course, it helps that Jennifer has the figure for it - better than most women half her age - and the youthful complexion to match.

But with her daring skin dress, what Jennifer proves is that women of a certain age needn't be pigeon-holed, nor strong-armed by stylists into safe (read: dull) column dresses or dreary chiffon.

Jennifer proves there is no need to dump your mini skirts, flippy dresses and, yes, leather - as long as you do it right. And now, as M&S release a brown leather skater dress for S/S13, they are giving women of Britain the chance to embrace the leather look too.

Take a tip from Jennifer when you style this one up.

She kept things simple: her hair glossy and youthful, her make-up natural. 
Too much and she could have risked tipping edgy into trashy.

As it was though, she rocked it.

Elsewhere
in the land of leather, we have for inspiration Modern Family actress Julie Bowen, 42, 
in full-length leather at the SAGs, and Glee star Jane Lynch, 52, 
looking rather fabulous in a leather-corseted dress at the same event.

But the award for wearing leather 
over 40 has to go to Jennifer Lopez, who can wear anything from an 
all-in-one white leather trouser ensemble to a leather maxi skirt with 
the utmost panache.

The secret to her success? Always accessorise your leather get-up with a toyboy.
