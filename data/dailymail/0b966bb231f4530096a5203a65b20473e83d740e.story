Harassed: Wanda Arena, 42, alleges her orthopedist sent her 'filthy' text messages

A bikini model claims her doctor pestered her with sexual advances for three years.

Wanda Arena, 42, from New York City, alleges orthopedist Dr Mark Sherman, sent her a barrage of 'filthy' text messages, including one exposing himself.

Dr. Mark Sherman allegedly targeted Arena, a widow who lost her husband in the 9/11 attacks, after taking her phone number from a patient file when she came to him for surgery on a torn knee ligament in 2009, according to a lawsuit she filed.

Arena says that for three years Sherman, a high-profile surgeon who led a team of local doctors to Haiti after the January 2010 earthquake, harassed her with 
random phone calls and romantic poems sent by text reported the New York Daily News.

But the mother of two, who is now pregnant with a third child was horrified when he allegedly sent her a photo of his genitals one night in October with the message 'Where r u?'

He then followed the lewd photo up with four phone calls that Arena ignored, according to a draft of 
the lawsuit.

'It kind of enraged me and scared me at the same time,' Arena told the Daily News. 'Who does that?'

A secretary at Dr Sherman's medical practice, Staten Island Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, told MailOnline no one would comment on the Arena's claims.

Arena who lost her husband Louis, a New York firefighter, in the 
terrorist attack at the World Trade Center, replied with outrage: 'Your(sic) a filthy animal and don’t ever text me again or I’ll go to the police.'

Sherman who was divorced about a year ago and lives alone, according to a woman who answered the door at his Staten Island home, replied 'OK. Sorry,' the Daily News reports.

The Staten Island Advance
reports that Sherman is well-known figure in the community who has a 
reputation for charitable giving and working to promote physical 
activity and better race relations on Staten Island.

Arena, a part-time emergency medic, is now engaged to a
police officer, who also had knee surgery done by Sherman.

Community leader: Dr Sherman has organized a festival for the last ten years that promotes physical activity and better race relations among children on Staten Island

Target: Arena, pictured here with her fiance who initially referred her to Dr Sherman, says she was the victim of unwanted sexual advances for three years

Tragic: Arena's husband, Louis, died while trying to rescue his fellow New Yorkers at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001

Arena's fiancé, who is a New York police officer, referred her to
Sherman.

She filed a harassment complaint to police, but declined to follow through with the investigation because she thought that would be 'going too far.'

Arena lawyer Robert Brown was expected to file a response on Wednesday.

Neighbors told the Daily News that Sherman has worked hard to foster better race relations of his native Staten Island, including organizing a festival that has run for the last ten years.

Competitor: Arena works as a part-time EMT, but is active in bikini modeling, fitness and bodybuilding competitions

Moving on: Arena is the mother of two children, but is currently pregnant with a third children and is engaged to be married
