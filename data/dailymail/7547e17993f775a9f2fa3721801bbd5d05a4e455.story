Looking for love... still: Dr Emil Chynn

When it comes to the dating scene in New York, it's a jungle out there.

However an Ivy League-educated surgeon is proof that not even looks, status and financial security can give you a head start in the love stakes.

Doctor Emil Chynn, who was educated at Harvard, posted a personal ad in the alumni magazine of Columbia University - offering a $10,000 donation to charity for an introduction to the woman of his dreams.

The ad appeared in the classified section of the University's Spring 2012Â  edition, it was reported.

According to the Huffington Post, the advert reads: 'LASEK SURGEON: Featured in NY Times/Wall Street Journal.

'Dartmouth, Columbia, Harvard, Emory, NYU degrees. Seeks smart, sweet, skinny SWF 30 for marriage.

'$10,000 donation to your charity for intro! dr@ParkAvenueLASKEK.com.'

While Dr Chynn, who runs a practice in Kipps Bay, has not elaborated any further on the advert, it would seem the 43-year-old's search for the right lady has been fraught with difficulty in recent years.

In 2010 he posted an advert on Craigslist for a female personal assistant whose role would include helping to find him a girlfriend.

The job was advertised offering rent-free living in a studio flat on Park Avenue and the job description included reactivating Dr Chynn's match.com profile and 'trolling' the website for potential dates because he did not have time to do it himself.

The successful candidate would also have been required to spend an hour a day 'walking' on his back or - if they weighed more than 115lbs - simply giving him a 'deep massage'.

According to the Huffington Post, the assistant who succeeded in finding him a wife, the ad said, would be given a cash bonus.

The advert added: 'My parents will give you reward of $10,000 in cash, ie bills, so that's a bonus!'
