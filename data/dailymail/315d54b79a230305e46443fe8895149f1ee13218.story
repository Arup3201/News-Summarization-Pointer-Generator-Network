A morbidly obese woman, dubbed the 'half ton killer' after being charged with her nephew's murder, showed off her dramatic weight loss today as she broke her silence on the ordeal.  

Mayra Rosales originally told police she had accidentally killed 
two-year-old Eliseo by rolling on top of him 
while babysitting four years ago. However her 1,100lb frame became her defense - as investigators proved she was so heavy she could not have committed the crime.

Rosales, from Texas, said on Tuesday that she despised the nickname. She appeared to have lost a significant 
amount of weight in photos posted on her 
Facebook page. Comments from supporters suggested that the 31-year-old had her stomach stapled 
earlier this month.

The truth at last: 'Half-ton killer' Mayra Rosales broke her silence today (left), saying she forgave her sister Jaime despite almost taking the fall for her nephew's murder

The medical evidence at Mayra's 2008 
murder trial in Texas revealed she had covered for sister Jaime who beat
her son to death with a hairbrush.

Rosales,
31, broke her silence on Tuesday to say she forgives her sister and has
'nothing against her' even though she had allowed her to take the fall.

Rosales appeared on chat show Anderson via satellite from Houston, Texas. When host Anderson Cooper asked why she had forgiven her sister for the brutal murder, Rosales said: 'She's still my sister and I love her.'

The morbidly obese woman was charged with murder in March 2008 after she covered for Jaime when Eliseo was taken to hospital as a result of head injuries.

When it was proven by the defense that Mayra could not have committed the crime, her sister went on the run. A few months later, Jaime was 
persuaded to return to Texas where she stood trial.

Pleading guilty to the lesser charge of causing injury to a child, Jaime was sentenced to 15 years in jail. She will soon be eligible for parole after serving two years.

Her three other children are now being cared for by their grandmother.

Not going anywhere: Mayra (pictured with her husband Bernie) told police that she killed her nephew by accident by rolling on top of him while babysitting

Rosales was found innocent after 
doctors revealed that the
boy could only have died from a blow to the head - which could not have
been struck by Rosales because she was too big to lift her arm. 

In 2008, shortly before Eliseo was murdered, Mayra and her husband Bernie had moved in with her sister Jaime in Sullivan City, Texas.

Jaime had agreed to be a full-time carer when Mayra became so large she struggled to walk.

However despite the fact that Mayra was 
almost entirely bed-ridden, Jaime would often go out, leaving Mayra in 
charge of her four children.

'I was more of a mother than Jaime,' Mayra has previously said. In March 2008, Mayra witnessed her sister hit Eliseo Jr. 

‘Jaime
was giving my nephew breakfast and he didn’t want to eat,’ Mayra said. ‘I told her if he was crying he wasn’t going to eat, but she got mad, 
got a brush and hit him on his arms, legs and head which left a bump.'

Later that day, Eliseo Jr began suffering breathing problems and Mayra called an ambulance.

Jaime
phoned her sister from the hospital, sobbing that police would not 
let her see her son unless she told them who had hurt him.

Manpower: It took ten men to remove Mayra in a removal truck from her sister's home in 2008

Jaime begged Mayra to tell the authorities she was responsible for the injuries. In a move she would come to bitterly regret, Mayra accepted.

Rosales said she did so to help her sister so that she would not lose her other children.

‘I
told the investigators that I rolled over to the edge of my bed to 
where Junior was and my hand slipped and I fell on him with my hand. I 
fell. I was the one to blame. But only by accident,' she explained.

When her two-year-old nephew later died, Mayra Rosales was arrested and charged with capital murder.

At her trial, the court heard that the fatal injuries sustained by 
the boy were consistent with a blow to the head and could not have been 
caused by someone falling on him.

'It would have required her to have 
to swing her arm to strike the child on the head but she could never 
move her arm in that manner,’ said Mayra’s lawyer Sergio Valdez. ‘We 
knew that her size was her best defence because she couldn’t move her 
arm.'

Despite the physical impossibility of
Mayra committing such a crime, the authorities had to conduct a full trial,
with Mayra as chief suspect.

Months
went by before a courtroom was found that was large enough to 
accommodate Mayra, and doors and walls had to be removed to fit her in.

The stress of the case caused Mayra's
health to deteriorate to the point that she had to be admitted to a 
hospital for the super-obese.

When a regular ambulance was too small to transport her, a
removal truck had to be used.

‘I
began retaining more water in my legs and they got so hard,’ she said.

‘The skin is so stretched out that it hurts. It feels like my legs are 
going to pop like a balloon.

'Sometimes the sores open up and water oozes
out. I wondered if we should amputate.'

She added: 'Sometimes I got mad. I tried not to show
it that much because I didn’t want anyone feeling bad for me.

'It was 
like I was in prison, with chains holding me there so I couldn’t move.’
