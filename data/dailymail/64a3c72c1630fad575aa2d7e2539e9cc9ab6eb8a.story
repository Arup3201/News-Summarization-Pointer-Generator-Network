The burden of nursery fees on working parents is now akin to taking on a 'second mortgage', childcare charities have warned.

A full-time nursery place will now set a family back around £11,000 a year - almost on a par with the average price of a place at private school - rising to £14,000 in London.

The cost has almost doubled in a decade.

A report from the Daycare Trust and the Family and Parenting Institute found that in some parts of Britain the cost of childcare can reach as high as £42,000 for a full-time nursery place - 25 per cent more than annual boarding fees at a top public school like Charterhouse in Surrey.

The report said the typical cost per hour for a child under two has gone up by 77 per cent since 2003 to reach £4.26, while wages have stagnated.

It found that one central London nursery was charging a staggering £42,000 for a full-time place.

The average weekly cost of a part-time (25 hours a week) nursery placement for a child under two, according to the report:

The report argued that childcare costs are becoming increasingly difficult for families to manage. In the last year alone, the average nursery cost for a child aged under two has increased at an above-inflation rate of 4.2 per cent, to around £106 a week for a part-time place at 25 hours a week.

Soaring childcare fees are a key issue for the Coalition, but the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are yet to agree on reforms to tackle the spiralling cost.

Costs for children aged over two have increased at an even faster rate of 6.6 per cent annually to around £104 a week for a part-time place, the report found.

Childcare costs for older children have soared by 9 per cent over the last year, with the typical cost of an after-school club at 15 hours a week reaching around £50.

Anand Shukla, chief executive of Daycare Trust and the Family and Parenting Institute said: 'The survey makes clear that, from a parent's perspective, costs are increasingly difficult to manage which is a finding that should concern us all.

'Families are being expected to pay more for their child's nursery place - an average of £14,000 per year in London - than the fees for many private schools - and this cannot continue.'

The survey regularly asks local authorities to report the price that parents pay for different forms of childcare in their area.

The report suggested that the rising cost of childcare is evidence of a 'market failure in our childcare system', with a lack of new providers setting up to meet levels of demand in some areas.

The report pointed out that 91 per cent of nursery care is delivered by the private and not-for-profit sectors in England. It said that private sector providers often have more costs to overcome than those in the public sector such as rents and servicing debts.

The study said that much of the expense of childcare is driven by staffing costs. At present, regulations stipulate that for children under two in nurseries there must be one member of staff for three children.

The report said: 'While salaries for nursery workers are not high, the need to maintain safe supervision levels and high quality childcare does, inevitably, mean that childcare cannot - and should not - be provided 'on the cheap'.'

One of the ways in which the Government helps parents with childcare costs is a voucher scheme which is available through employers and allows mothers and fathers to pay for childcare out of their pre-tax wages.

Basic rate tax payers can pay for up to £243 of childcare a month with the vouchers.

Julian Foster, managing director of one of the voucher schemes, named Computershare Voucher Services, called for the limits on childcare vouchers to be increased and said the scheme should be extended to help the self-employed.

He said: '(This) would show to this country's working families that Government "gets it". They get that support needs to be widely accessible, they get that household budgets are becoming increasingly strained, and they get that working mothers and fathers - part of the lifeblood of the British economy - need adequate support to raise their families and this country's future.'
