Bill Cosby victim Beverly Johnson found herself in the middle of the war between Rosie O'Donnell and Whoopi Goldberg when she asked Whoopi if she would do a one-on-one interview on The View rather than be questioned by the other co-hosts. 

Apparently there was no such thing as a holiday cease-fire behind the scenes at the faltering daytime talk show after Rosie learned that Johnson would only appear on the show if Whoopi alone conducted the interview. 

The ex-supermodel had reached out to Whoopi privately to share her experience with Cosby after seeing the Oscar winner express endless support for the troubled TV icon on The View.

Tug if war: Former supermodel Beverly Johnson had insisted that she would come on The View only if she could have a one-on-one interview with Whoopi Golderg and not Rosie O'Donnell, Rosie Perez or Nicolle Wallace. Eventually Rosie got her way and Johnson sat sown with all the co-hosts

Rosie Perez had a major melt down recently after a hostile, gum-chewing Rosie O treated her with disdain during an on-air segment discussing the rape allegations against Bill Cosby. Perez had argued that Cosby has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true

Goldberg knew in advance that Johnson was going to break her silence.

'Whoopi is so conflicted on the matter because knows both Bill and Beverly. Though she wants to continue to give Bill the benefit of the doubt, she also knows that Beverly would not lie about something like this if it wasn't true,' a source close to the show tells Mail Online.

Goldberg asked Johnson to come on The View to discuss her story with their audience. 

The supermodel said she would, but only if she could sit down one-on-one with Goldberg, who passed her desires along to the show's producers. 

Johnson says that she went to Bill Cosby's Manhattan townhouse for an audition and believes that he had drugged her cappuccino

'Producers were willing to do whatever Beverly wanted to get her on the show and agreed to cut out Rosie as well as other co-hosts Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace.

'That infuriated Rosie,' the source explained.

O'Donnell hit the roof hearing that Johnson would appear on The View only in a sit down with Whoopi. 

She felt the move was a 'slap in the face,' as she has been very vocal in her support for the victims and belief that Cosby is a rapist. 

Her passion for the Cosby story has also created tension with fellow co-host Rosie Perez, as previously reported by Mail Online.

Perez had a major melt down after a hostile, gum-chewing Rosie O treated her with disdain during an on-air segment discussing the rape allegations against Bill Cosby. 

Perez had argued that Cosby has been pilloried by social media and that there is no way to prove that the allegations are true. Perez attempted to defend her opinion to O'Donnell but O'Donnell wasn't having it.  

O'Donnell told producers she 'would not stand for that,' and escalated her complaint to ABC News, that now oversees The View.

She went to the network level and complained about the decision. After pleading her case, ABC News actually agreed with her and told producers to go back to Beverly and tell her she had to talk to all of the co-hosts,' the source detailed.

The rift between the two hosts of The View is so bad,  Rosie was the only personality from the show that Whoopi did not invite to her annual holiday party

'Goldberg felt that O'Donnell had filed the complaint just to undermine her, especially since she has done solo interviews and segments with her friend Marilu Henner and various child stars she wanted on the show.

On The View Monday, Johnson told her story about her visit to Cosby's Manhattan brownstone where she was convinced he drugged her and then threw her into a cab when she she screamed MF realizing what he had done. 

While Rosie  seemed sympathetic, Whoopi could not seem to wrap her head around what Johnson was saying.

"I do not think [that Bill Cosby raped me], no," replied Johnson when Goldberg asked if she had been sexually assaulted by Cosby.

"You're not sure?" Goldberg asked, appearing somewhat skeptical of what actually happened.The rift between the two hosts of The View is so bad, O'Donnell was the only personality from the show that Goldberg did not invite to her annual holiday party at her home outside the city last Starday. 

Perez and Nicolle Wallace attended.
