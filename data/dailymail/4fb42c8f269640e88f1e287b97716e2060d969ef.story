At last! The perfect job for those who just want to get away from it all.

A hotel in Finland is advertising for a 'professional sleeper' to spend 35 days testing out the beds and write all about it.

Sounds easy enough? Well, there's a catch. You have to be able to speak, read and write fluently and in English AND Finnish - and a few words of Russian are a bonus, too.

What a great job: Hotel Finn in Helsinki is advertising for a 
'professional sleeper' to spend 35 days testing out the beds and write 
all about it - the catch is that applicants must speak English and 
Finnish

And expect stiff competition: so far more than 600 would-be professional guests have applied for the cushy post.

In an effort to drum up publicity after being closed for lengthy renovations, Hotel Finn is advertising for one blogger to spend a night in each its 35 different rooms this summer.

'This person will share his thoughts, adventures and experiences of living in the best spot of summery Helsinki,' the job spec boasts.

Situated on the top floors of a historic building in Helsinki, the Finnish capital, the hotel is just a short walk from the the city's central railway station and bus station, and well located for tourist attractions and parks, theatres and restaurants.

With tourist season prices ranging from £66 to £130 a night, whoever lands the plum job will save a packet while enjoying a lengthy summer break.

Home comforts: British applicants for the 'professional sleeper' role will be pleased to hear that free tea is always available in reception during opening hours

Describing itself as 'the cheapest and the best hotel in the cold and expensive capital of Finland', Hotel Finn prides itself on a 'youthful and regenerating' atmosphere.

Walls are decorated with works from young and aspiring photographers - which are available for sale - while the literary minded can visit the hotel's own library to pick up a holiday read.

And any British applicants for the 'professional sleeper' role will be pleased to hear that free tea is always available in reception during opening hours.

Hotel manager Tio Tikka says he thought up the stunt to help promote the hotel after lengthy renovations.

Mr Tikka said Wednesday that they were looking for a 'dynamic person to write a quality blog' about their daily experiences at the basic hotel, which has no bar or restaurant.

Unfortunately for most of us, they have set the bar pretty high for potential applicants. Fluent Finnish and English are essential, while Russian is a plus.

The job opened May 17 with applications closing end of April, and so far more that 600 would-be hotel sleepers have applied.
