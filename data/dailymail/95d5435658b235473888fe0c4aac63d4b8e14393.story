Adidas has suspended its contract with Tyson Gay after the former double world sprint champion failed an out-of-competition dope test.

'We are shocked by these recent allegations, and even if we presume his innocence until proven otherwise, our contract with Tyson is currently suspended,' an Adidas spokesman said.

Adidas' agreements with athletes give it the right to terminate the contract 'if the athlete is found guilty of the possession or use of drugs or any other prohibited substance by the relevant governing sports body having jurisdiction over the athlete.'

Shock: Tyson Gay has had his contract with Adidas suspended

Gay, who has been on Adidas' books since 2005 and who was
the fastest man in the world this year, has tested positive for an 
unidentified substance and former world record-holder Asafa Powell was 
among five Jamaican athletes to have failed drugs tests for a banned 
stimulant.

Chinese sporting goods company Li Ning, which sponsors Powell, was not immediately available for comment.

Usain Bolt’s agent Ricky Simms said 
that his client was not implicated in the scandal, but Olympic relay 
gold medallist Sherone Simpson confirmed she had tested positive for 
oxilofrine at Jamaica’s national trials last month.

Unconfirmed reports claimed that  27-year-old Nesta Carter, who ran 9.87sec in a Madrid 100m on Saturday night, had also fallen foul of the authorities. If proved, the three quickest men over 100m this year will have failed drugs tests and will miss next month’s World Championships in Moscow, leaving the sport in crisis.

Gay, 30, the second fastest man of all
time, has run the three quickest 100m times of 2013, but tested 
positive for an unnamed substance at an out-of-competition test on May 
16.

The triple world 
champion will have his ‘B’ sample tested this week, but has already 
pulled out of the USA’s World Championships team and Friday’s Diamond 
League meeting in Monaco.

Gay said: ‘I don’t have a sabotage story. I put my trust in someone and was let down.

‘I don’t have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake or it was on USADA’s (United States Anti-Doping Agency) hands, someone playing games. I don’t have any of those stories.

‘I made a mistake. I know exactly what went on, but I can’t discuss it right now. I hope I am able to run again, but I will take whatever punishment I get like a man.’

You too: After the news of Gay's failed test, it emerged that Asafa Powell (left) also tested positive

On a dark day for athletics, it emerged Powell was one of five Jamaican athletes to have failed tests. Powell, Simpson and Carter are coached by Stephen Francis at the MVP Track and Field Club and the two confirmed failed tests relate to banned stimulant oxilofrine. Two athletes who compete in field events, including a junior, are also understood to be implicated.

Powell and Simpson both insisted they had not taken the drug intentionally, with sources suggesting it was part of a supplement introduced to their training group. But if their ‘B’ samples back up  the findings of the ‘A’ samples, they will face two-year bans and may never run again.

Devastating: Gay has admitting to using a banned substance

Gutting: The news is a true blow to those involved in athletics

Powell, 30, said: ‘A sample I gave this year has returned “adverse findings”. The substance oxilofrine was found, which is considered by the authorities to be a banned stimulant. I have never knowingly or wilfully taken any supplements or substances that break any rules.

‘I am not now — nor have I ever been — a cheat. My team has launched an investigation and we are cooperating with relevant agencies and law enforcement authorities to discover how the substance got in my system.

‘This result has left me devastated. I am reeling from this genuinely surprising result. I accept the  consequences. My fault, however, is not cheating but not being more vigilant. I want to reiterate that in my career as an athlete I have never sought to enhance my  performance with any substance.’

Pulling out: Gay will take no part in the Moscow World Championships next month after the findings

A member of Powell’s support team was reportedly detained by Italian law enforcement officers last night after a property in Italy was raided. It is believed the trainer provided the sprinter with supplements that could have  contributed to the positive test.

Simpson, 28, also took responsibility. ‘As an athlete, I know I am responsible for whatever goes  into my body,’ she said. ‘I would not intentionally take an illegal  substance. I am sorry for any hurt or embarrassment this positive test may have caused.’  

This is the biggest crisis to hit athletics since the BALCO scandal at the turn of the century, when a number of American athletes, including Olympic champion  Marion Jones, were found to be taking banned substances.

Veronica Campbell-Brown, a friend of Gay and the world 200m champion, was suspended after a positive test for a banned masking agent in June.

Former world 110m hurdles champion 
Colin Jackson said it was an ‘absolutely awful’ day for track and field,
while British 200m champion James Ellington called it a ‘disappointing 
day for our sport’.

Jackson added: ‘Gay is a global star. It takes away faith from the public. The good side is it doesn’t matter what level you’re at; if you’re taking drugs you will get caught.’

Neil Black, performance director of British Athletics, said: ‘I would start with utter disappointment. You think of the athletes striving day by day and it must rip the backside out of them. We all suffer.’

The banned drug oxilofrine that top Jamaican sprinters Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson have tested positive for is a stimulant used to boost the body's ability to burn fat.

The substance helps athletes boost their power-to-weight ratio with more lean muscle and less fat, and so increase their speed.

It may also increase the rate at which the heart reaches its maximum performance during exercise, meaning a greater supply of oxygen can get to the muscles earlier.

Oxilofrine is an agent that stimulates part of the nervous system and was previously used to treat low blood pressure. More recently, it has started to appear in combination with caffeine in dietary supplements marketed as weight loss products.

However, the superiority of using oxilofrine over an exercise warm-up to achieve this appears unconvincing.

There have been no previous findings in Britain but competitors in cycling, athletics, weightlifting, rugby union and American football have been banned in the last three years.

They include the USA's Amy Dodson, one of the world's top amputee runners, who received a six-month ban in 2011 and American cyclist Flavia Oliveira who was banned for 18 months in 2009.

Both said they had unknowingly ingested the stimulant via an over-the-counter supplement.
