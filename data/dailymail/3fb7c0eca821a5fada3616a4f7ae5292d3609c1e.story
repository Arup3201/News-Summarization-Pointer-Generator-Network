It's the no-frills cash-and-carry chain popular with corner shopkeepers and restaurant owners.

But it seems there is more to Costco than meets the eye.

For the warehouse wholesaler has beaten leading high street chains in a customer satisfaction survey to find the best optician.

The warehouse wholesaler Costco has beaten leading high street chains in a customer satisfaction survey to find the best optician

Customers were asked about their experience of buying glasses or lenses and having their eyes tested over the last three years.

Costco came a very close second behind the ‘local independent optician’, and easily beat well-known brands such as Specsavers, Boots, Dollond & Aitchison and Tesco.

The survey of 5,409 Which? members revealed Costco – usually associated with bulk food and drink purchases – provided value for money and a good service despite budget surroundings.

The wholesaler scored 86 per cent (with local independents at 88 per cent) and Asda was third at 77 per cent. Specsavers was given a 72 per cent rating, slightly ahead of Boots and Dollond & Aitchison on 69 per cent. Tesco won a 65 per cent rating and Optical Express was bottom of the pile on 59 per cent.

‘The top-scoring stores are all about convenient appointments, punctuality, great products and value for money,’ said Which?, adding that Costco showed ‘great opticians don’t always need a glitzy shop front’.

One customer who took part in the survey concluded: ‘I found Costco offers very high quality lenses and a wide selection of frames at much cheaper prices than the high street.’

An undercover Which? researcher who went to Costco was taken to a consulting room in a portable building for an eye test by a ‘friendly guy in jeans’. He said there was ‘no hard sell’ and that he did not mind the ‘budget feel and relatively limited choice’ – concluding that he would come again.

Overall, the customers surveyed put a higher emphasis on good service rather than cheap special deals.

Summarising the feedback, the report stated: ‘You felt that independents were poor for special offers and only average for price, but they offered good value for money overall.’

One customer of an independent said: ‘Good-quality eye care is more important than a special offer.’
