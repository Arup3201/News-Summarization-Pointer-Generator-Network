An innovative new approach which uses pop-up rooms designed to be reminiscent of a bygone era is helping to reassure dementia patients.

RemPods - which are set up like rooms from past decades - are used to help calm those in hospitals and care homes by taking them back to more familiar times.

Designed in retro themes they are filled with authentic furniture and memorabilia which is hoped to get dementia sufferers talking about the memories they still retain.

The pioneering design includes a 1950s pop-up pod, pub, cinema, dance hall and vintage store, as well as many others with features from the 1960s.

They have now become a fixture in more than 40 NHS Trusts, care homes, day centres and care charities since the company was founded in 2009.

And in a further boost to the unique nostalgia product creator Richard Ernest, 35, has now got the backing of two judges from BBC2’s Dragons’ Den to roll the pods out worldwide.

Mr Jones and Ms Meaden agreed to each give £50,000 to the project in exchange for a 22.5 per cent share.

Richard described the process of going on the show as 'one of the scariest things I’ve ever done' and now intends to break into the U.S., Australia and New Zealand.

The father-of-two, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, first came up with the idea of the pod after forming a close friendship with an elderly neighbour and his wife - who suffered with dementia.

Over a period of several months Richard drove Sydney Swash, 98, to and from a care home to see his terminally ill wife.

When she sadly passed away, the pair became close friends, going to the cinema together and to the local pub. 

Richard had also been going through a tough time after losing his job and splitting up with his girlfriend, so they became inseparable.

The trips with Sydney, who is now in a care home himself, became the inspiration behind Richard’s innovative product, Reminiscence Pods, or RemPods for short.

This pop-up room harks back to a 1950s living room, complete with retro TV, a wireless, classic wallpaper and a vintage table. Mr Ernest said such a room enables a care home or hospital to transform a clinical space into a therapeutic and calming environment

He realised the importance of familiarity for sufferers and the need for more stimulating surroundings for those living with the degenerative illness.

Richard decided that creating a cost-effective pop-up reminiscence room would enable a care home or hospital to transform a clinical space into a therapeutic and calming environment that would reduce the anxiety in people with dementia.

'I’d never been in a care home before, I’d never witnessed dementia, never heard of it before, and everything just stemmed from that,' said Mr Ernest.

'I used to wait in reception and have a cup of tea and had people come up to me thinking I was their son or husband.

Here a mock-up of an old-fashioned pub helps to jog a patient's memory and reminds them of when they were younger and less ill. The rooms have become a fixture in more than 40 NHS trusts, care homes, day centres and care charities since the company was founded in 2009

'They were back in the Fifties and Sixties, in a different world and I got into dementia research from there. Sydney was always talking about the Fifties and the war too.'

He soon created a handful of themed rooms with era-specific furniture, including a television and radio from the era, standard lamp and rug with the intention of being a homely space.

There are also music, films and newspaper articles from the time. Richard appeared on Dragons’ Den on Sunday where he was quizzed by Deborah and Peter before they offered the substantial investment.

The trio have also agreed to donate some of the company’s profits to charity.

'I always wanted to give something back,' said Richard. 'It’s a commercial business but if it made a lot of money we all came to an agreement that we would give a percentage of the profits back to a charity such as The Alzheimer’s Society.'

The entrepreneur added that he cannot believe how much his life has turned around since meeting Sydney, who he still tries to visit as often as he can.

He said: 'I was volunteering and working in care. It was a struggle and we didn’t have a lot of money. It seems crazy but we were having our first baby and I thought ‘how are we going to survive?’

'I had a dream and this dream told me everything about what it was I was going to do and RemPods. I’ve never had anything like that before, and am not really religious, but I just had to do it.

'I got a credit card, which was a big risk and put £3,000 into the business and have never looked back.'
