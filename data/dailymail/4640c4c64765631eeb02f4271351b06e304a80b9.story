Grizzly bears have emerged from hibernation far earlier than expected in Yellowstone. 

The first confirmed report of grizzly bear activity in Yellowstone occurred on February 9, rangers confirmed today.

They usually emerge in first few weeks of March, prompting ranger to issue emergency warnings to visitors. 

The first confirmed report of grizzly bear activity in Yellowstone occurred on February 9, rangers confirmed today.

They blame the relatively mild winter weather for the early emergence of bears in the Greater Yellowstone area.

A grizzly bear was observed late in the afternoon, scavenging on a bison carcass in the central portion of the park.

'With bears emerging from hibernation hikers, skiers, and snowshoers are advised to stay in groups of three of more, make noise on the trail and carry bear spray,' the park said.

The same advice goes for those taking guided snowmobile trips in Yellowstone.

Bears begin looking for food soon after they emerge from their dens. 

They are attracted to elk and bison that have died during the winter. 

Carcasses are an important enough food source that bears will sometimes react aggressively when surprised while feeding on them.  

Yellowstone regulations require visitors to stay 100 yards from black and grizzly bears at all times.

The best defense is to stay a safe distance from bears and use binoculars, a spotting scope or telephoto lens to get a closer look, the park said.

It advises all visitors traveling in the park away from developed areas should stay in groups of three or more, make noise on the trail, keep an eye out for bears and carry bear spray. 

Yellowstone regulations require visitors to stay 100 yards from black and grizzly bears at all times.

'Bear spray has proven to be a good last line of defense, if kept handy and used according to directions when a bear is approaching within 30 to 60 feet,' it advises.

Even the park’s law enforcement rangers who carry firearms on duty rely on bear spray, rather than their weapons, as the most effective means to deal with a bear encounter.

Visitors are also reminded to keep food, garbage, barbecue grills and other attractants stored in hard-sided vehicles or bear-proof food storage boxes. This helps keep bears from becoming conditioned to human foods, and helps keep park visitors and their property safe.

Bear sightings should be reported to the nearest visitor center or ranger station as soon as possible.
