The pair clearly have a close relationship with Jumpy looking thrilled to show off for his master.

Jumpy shows he understands the instructions following orders to 'back up' and move slowly 'one step' at a time.

When the instructor says 'don't look at it' he coyly uses his paw to cover his eyes from the ball and does the same when he is told 'Don't look at it.'

When he eventually gets near the ball he is told he can only play with it when the instructor counts to three.
