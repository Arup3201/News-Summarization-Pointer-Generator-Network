A new Microsoft ad has taken a direct jab at Apple, the latest salvo in the tense tablet war between the two tech giants.

Turning up the snark, the 30-second ad features a side-by-side comparison of the two computers, an iPad on the left and the Microsoft Windows 8 tablet on the right.

The commercial features Appleâ€™s Siri, the voice recognition software that Apple first unveiled in the iPhone 4S in 2011.

Two for one: Microsoft tries in the ad to hammer home the point that iPad's cannot display to apps on the screen at once

'Sorry, I don't update like that,' the voice says in Siri's signature tone as the Windows 8 tablet displays a video and email at the same time.

The voice continues: 'I'm sorry, I can only do one thing at a time.'

'I guess PowerPoint isn't one of those things,' the mock Siri adds, hammering home the fact that Apple devices don't feature Microsoft apps.

Apparently giving up, 'Siri' asks: 'Should we just play chopsticks?' - an apparent dig at the iPad commercial 
where a user plays the song on the iPad's Garage Band app in a past iPad ad.

The ad then makes its final argument with a price comparison - $699 for the 64 GB iPad and $449 for the Windows 8 tablet.

Despite Microsoft's argument, Apple does not appear to be losing ground in the tablet wars, as the Windows 8 tablet received less-than-stellar reviews and has so far failed to measure up to the hype and sales of the similar Apple and Google devices.

Critics, as well as some consumers, lambasted the technology giant over Windows 8, mentioning the confusing array of touchscreen tiles and lack of Microsoft's trademark 'Start' button.

While Microsoft has experienced growth in recent years, any success is eclipsed by Apple, which unveiled the iPad Mini at about the same time as Windows 8.

Some reviewers liked the way Windows 8 greets users with a mosaic of tiles displaying applications instead of relying on the desktop icons that served as the welcome mat for years.

But others say it's a confusing jumble that will frustrate users accustomed to the older versions, particularly when they switch to desktop mode and don't see the familiar 'start' button and menu.

Struck by the flurry of complaints, Microsoft announced earlier this month that it was giving Windows 8 a makeover, known as Windows Blue.
