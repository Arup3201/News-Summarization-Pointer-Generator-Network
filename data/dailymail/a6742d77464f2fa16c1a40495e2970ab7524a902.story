Losing your keys is bad enough, but having to replace the entire lock because you don’t have a key to copy makes things even worse - not to mention expensive.

The KeyMe app promises to take the hassle and cost out of this by letting you store photos of your keys online, and order duplicates in the post.

Alternatively, the US service has kiosks that let you copy keys in an emergency, or share photos with a locksmith in person.

KeyMe is a New York-based digital locksmith. The app lets homeowners scan (pictured left) and store their keys in the cloud (pictured right), share these scans with family and friends, and order duplicates in the post. KeyMe is free on iOS but is only currently available in the US

KeyMe is free on iOS but is currently only available in the US. The New York-based startup is looking to expand the service, and an Android version of the app is in development.

After setting up an account, homeowners use their smartphone camera to take a photo of each side of the key.

The photo must be taken on a white background, from a distance of up to 4 inches (10cm), in order to avoid what the app calls ‘fly-by’ scans. 

After setting up an account,  homeowners use their smartphone camera to take a photo of each side of the key.

The photo has to be taken on a white background, from to 4 inches (10cm) away, in order to avoid what the app calls ‘fly-by’ scans.

Once a key is successfully scanned and stored, users can send their digital keychain to friends, family and housemates over email.

The owner and recipient can then order duplicates from within the app. 

Storing keys is free, but the cost of ordering duplicates depends on the type of key being copied, with prices starting at $10 (£6).

Alternatively, photos can be used by physical locksmiths to create copies, or users can print keys from KeyMe kiosks.  

This doesn’t, in theory, protect people from criminals taking photos of other people's keys though.

However, KeyMe does notify users whenever there is activity on their account, but this only applies if a potential thief is using that person’s account.

It is unknown whether KeyMe can recognise if the same key is scanned and added to a different account.

As an extra security measure, however, the app requires user verification, a credit card, a verified mailing address and an Apple-verified device and ID to purchase a key.

Michael Harbolt, vice president of marketing at KeyMe told MailOnline that if a thief, hypothetically, did want to steal a key and order a new one using the app, they 'would then have to use an Apple registered device, Apple ID and wireless carrier to download the app and provide user verification to access the app. 

'[They] would then have to provide a valid credit card to purchase these keys and a  mailing address. All of the data provided during this exchange could be used to easily identify [them].'

As an alternative, Mr Harbolt explained that a thief could 'simply walk down to a local locksmith and get a copy made by paying cash' without providing any method of identification. 

'Given a choice of the these two options - one where you can easily be identified, and one where there is no risk of being identified - as a criminal, which option are you more likely to pursue when attempting to commit a crime?,' continued Mr Harbolt. 

In terms of protecting the keys stored in the cloud, the company said: ‘We use commercial grade security to protect your key data.

‘Additionally, we do not store any personally identifiable information except for an email address and password.’

But, these security concerns only apply to ordering keys in the post. 

If a key is ordered from a locksmith in person, the user can verify their identity by having the phone, app and another form of physical ID.

Once a key is successfully scanned and stored, users can send their digital keychain to friends, family and housemates over email (illustrated). The owner and recipient can then order duplicates from within the app. Storing keys is free, but the cost depends on the type of key being copied, with prices starting at $10 (£6)

Alternatively, photos can be used by physical locksmiths to create copies. To order a key from a locksmith, the app produces a code (pictured) that the locksmith can use to create the duplicate. This code reveals the type of key, as well as its 'biting' code, which gives details about the shape and cut of the key

In an emergency, users can additionally print keys from KeyMe kiosks (pictured)

Equally, the app asks for a fingerprint to be used when printing a key from a physical kiosk.

This code reveals the type of key, as well as its 'biting' code, which gives details about the shape and cut of the key.

Once a key is successfully scanned and stored, users can send their digital keychain to friends, family and housemates over email, using the app’s ‘Share’ button. 

KeyMe sends an email confirmation when the recipient has accepted the key, but shared keys can’t be deactivated.

The owner and recipient can then order duplicates from within the app.

Storing keys is free, but the cost of ordering duplicates depends on the type of key being copied. 

As an example, a basic version starts at $10 (£6).

Postal orders take up to five business days to arrive, but the service also offers 3D printed keys with various designs, and these take up to five weeks to arrive.
