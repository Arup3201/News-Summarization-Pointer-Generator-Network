Dilapidated, dirty, mouldy, strewn with rubble and with boarded-up windows, these frightening shacks are still selling for an amazing half a million dollars - or more.

All of the properties are in the wealthy and exclusive San Francisco Bay area of California, which may go some way to explaining the astoundingly high price, despite a crash in property values in the region as a result of a real estate crash that began in 2009.

They were collected on Pinterest by blogger Xin Lu, who writes for Wise Bread, a site that gives tips on finance and living frugally, who also lives in the area.

Dilapidated and foreboding shacks like this are selling for half a million dollars or more in San Francisco

Although this is just the garage of the $600,000 property in Berkeley, the actual house is more than a bit run-down too

Many of the for-sale fixer-uppers are so foreboding they look like they would suit a (very rich) serial killer. Handily, they may already have the power tools necessary to refurbish the site.

One shack, listed at $1.35million, is in Los Gatos and comes with more than three acres, which probably explains the price.

Mrs Lu compared it to the hotel featured in cult horror The Shining, featuring Jack Nicholson as a writer sent murderously insane by the supernatural Overlook Hotel.

'The listing is full of creepy pictures at odd angles,' she wrote. 'And the address? 19366 Overlook Road. Welcome to The Overlook! All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.'

This Albany shack was sold for $500,000. The listing describes it as 'frankly uninhabitable'

This $1.35million Los Gatos shack (left) comes with more than three acres. A bargain, if buyers can bring themselves to approach the foreboding structure. The listing for the $505,000 Brisbane shack (right) recommends: 'Bring a contractor with you'

Welcome home: The shack in Los Gatos is seen lined with tossed tree stumps with mulch paving the way to the front door

View: The shack in Los Gatos comes with more than three acres, seen here overlooking its backyard which earns its high value thanks to its view overlooking the ocean

Fixer upper: The yard could easily be cleared out and redesigned to accommodate visual access to its view said to overlook water

Another secluded property is pictured with a yard covered in rusty machinery and tools and broken, dirty lawn equipment, perfect for those who require privacy. And somewhere screams won't carry.

It's yours for $1.8million. Why so much? Mrs Lu has the answer: 'There is an explanation: According to the listing, the lot is one mile from the planned new Apple headquarters.'

The location of one shack, which boasts panoramic views of the picturesque San Francisco Bay, is so desirable the sellers were incredibly frank about its condition in their listing.

It said: 'Frankly uninhabitable, with two bedrooms and a bath but no kitchen.'

It was snapped up for a cool $500,000 earlier this year.

Nearly $2million for a house like this?
It IS just one mile from the planned new Apple headquarters...

It may look like a western cattle ranch after it was torched by outlaws but the property, and more importantly its land, is worth $1.275million
