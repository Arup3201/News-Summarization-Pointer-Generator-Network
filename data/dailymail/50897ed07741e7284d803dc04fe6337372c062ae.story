Steven Gerrard says that Luis Suarez 'engineered' his move away from Anfield this summer, expressing his disappointment at his former teammate's World Cup antics and summer move.

The former England captain said that he knew Suarez would leave Liverpool as soon as he saw the Uruguayan's bite on Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini.

Gerrard had hoped that Suarez would stay at the club after he topped the scoring charts in the Premier League last season, but told Sky Sports that the incident, which led to a four month ban, was the turning point.

'I thought he was going to stay, I thought we'd have got another year out of him,' said Gerrard.

'I was actually already on the floor when I saw the bite because we knew we were going out. It was a double blow, knowing you're going out of the World Cup and knowing you're going to lose your best player.

'I knew there was no way back for him then and I knew he was going to engineer a way out.'

However, Gerrard is excited about working with new striker, and Suarez's replacement, Mario Balotelli. 

The Italian forward made his debut in Liverpool's 3-0 win over Tottenham, and Gerrard believes his new colleague can has all the attributes to make an impact.

'It's an interesting one because he's got a point to prove.'

'Similar to Sturridge, people are waiting to see whether he'll take to Liverpool, whether Liverpool is going to be the right place for him.

'He's certainly got the talent and ability. I've trained with him two or three times and he's got a great touch, he's quick, he's got the movement – he's got everything in the bag.

'We'll have to wait and see if he behaves himself and performs – that's what everyone is waiting for and I'm no different.' 

Decent debut: Mario Balotelli lasted 60 minutes in his first Liverpool appearance against Tottenham

Point to prove: Gerrard is convinced the striker has the talent and the quality to replace Suarez at Anfield
