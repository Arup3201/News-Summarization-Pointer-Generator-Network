A police officer has suffered a gunshot wound to the leg from his own firearm following a struggle in Melbourne.

The Sergeant, from the Darebin Police Service, had been called to a hotel  in Preston in Melbourne's North at around 7:30pm due to a man who was reportedly self-harming.

Although police managed to stop the man, a 'struggle' broke out in a hotel room during which the officer's gun was discharged.

A police spokesperson said both the officer and the man were taken to hospital for treatment with non-life threatening injuries.

An ambulance spokesperson told the Herald Sun that a man with 'lower body injuries' was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition.

Detectives from the Crime Command will investigate the incident, a regular practice whenever a police firearm is discharged.

A man who claimed to be a relative of the  man involved in the struggle was seen outside the hotel.

He told the Age that his relative was mentally unstable and aged in his 40s.
