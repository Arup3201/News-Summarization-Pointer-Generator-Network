A surge of millions of baby eels in the River Severn this spring has meant local restaurants can serve the delicacy for the first time in years.

Elver catches in the river around Gloucester have been their highest for 30 years - meaning there are enough of the tiny worm-like fish to make their way onto British menus at cut down prices.

This year numbers could reach up to 100million - ten times more than last year.

Millions more elver eels have appeared in the River Severn meaning restaurants can now serve them for the first time in years and at cut-down prices

So many have been caught this spring that
the city's elver station had to close for two weeks because its storage
tanks were full and it was turning away fishermen trying to sell them.

In past generations elver eels were a cheap and popular local delicacy.

But in the 70s and 80s the demand for them in the Far East - where they are credited with aphrodisiac qualities - turned them into a luxury as expensive as caviar.

Since the recent surge in numbers prices being paid to the fishermen have dropped from £200 a kilo at the start of the season to just £85.

Because the UK Glass Eeels station at Over, near Gloucester, was closed fishermen were selling their catches elsewhere - including to the Tiger's Eye restaurant in Southgate Street where chef Robert Sinyard has put them on the menu.

Peter Wood, of UK Glass Eels, at his elver station with some of the baby eels he has caught this year

He bought two kilos last week and is serving 20gram helpings cooked with bacon and scrambled egg for £8.50 a plate.

'Eels are meant to be a critically 
endangered species but it certainly doesn't look like it here,' said 
Peter Wood of UK Glass Eels.

'We have had huge catches such as we have not seen for a couple of decades.

'I would say the catch has been 20 times larger than it was at the low point four years ago.'

Mr Wood's firm sends elvers to 
countries across Europe for re-stocking of rivers - Sweden, Denmark, 
Holland, Germany, Latvia and Lithuania are among the destinations.

He believes that the numbers caught this year could be enough to keep rivers healthily stocked with eels for six to 10 years.

So
far, 660,000 Severn elvers have been donated for re-stocking rivers in 
this country and that figure will rise at the end of the season, he 
said.

The elvers need to be taken out of the
Severn and relocated because flood barriers are now so effective that 
they would be unable to reach other streams and tributaries and would 
perish.

Andrew Kerr, former 
chairman of Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust and now chairman of the 
Sustainable Eel Group, said 'It is just extraordinary how many elvers 
there have been in the Severn this season.'

He said the precise reasons why there are shortages some years and gluts others cannot be explained.

But the variation of currents in the Atlantic as the elvers are swept from the Sargasso Sea to the Severn could be part of the reason.

'They migrate with the tide and they come up the river in waves. There have been tales this year of fifty mile streams of elvers,' he said.

Mr Kerr said 330,000 elvers have been released into rivers in Somerset today another 330,000 are being put into the River Avon at Tewkesbury.

One of the reasons why Severn elvers are in so much demand for restocking programmes is that the way they are caught - with traditional trough-shaped 'artisan' nets - does not damage them in the same way as fishing methods elsewhere, said Mr Kerr.

He was not pleased, however, to be told that elvers are back on restaurant menus again.

'We
are not that keen on them being eaten although it is better than them 
just being wasted if they get stuck in the river,' he said.

The worst year for elver catches on the Severn was 2009 when about a million were netted.

The following year it was about 3 million and then in 2011 and 2012 there were 9-12 million.

'This year we could be talking about 100million - ten times last year,' he said.

'The UK Glass Eels station had 1-2 tonnes in one night - that's four million elvers. the catches are the biggest for at least 20-30 years.'

Back in the 1970s, when elvers were plentiful, riverside dwellers ate them regularly - and there was an annual Easter Monday elver eating contest on the village green at Frampton on Severn.

Competitors would sit on a makeshift stage and wolf down a plate of one pound of fried elvers (half a pound in the ladies contest). But the competion had to be stopped when elvers became scarce and highly expensive.

Now, shoppers in Gloucester have the chance to try the local delicacy cooked the traditional way at the Tigers Eye restaurant in Southgate street.

Chef Robert said: 'I still had to pay £100 a kilo for the ones I bought but it is rare for them to be available to restaurants so we wanted to have some.

'The elver dishes are just flying out of the door and I shall only be able to serve them for a couple more days before we run out.'
