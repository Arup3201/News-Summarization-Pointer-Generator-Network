Washington Nationals star Bryce Harper was forced to leave a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers last night after he ran straight into the scoreboard in right field at Dodger Stadium.

The right fielder received 11 stitches but did not suffer a concussion as a result of the violent crash into the outfield wall.

Harper, 20, was trying to make a catch on a long fly ball off the bat of Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis in the fifth inning when he smacked face-first into the scoreboard.Â 

Collision course: Bryce Harper sprinted into right center field as he chased down a hard-hit ball

Impact: Harper was still running and apparently did not notice the lit up scoreboard in front of him

Crash: The impact with the wall sent Harper's cap flying

Big hit: Harper staggered for a moment before collapsing to the ground

The impact sent Harper's cap flying as he bounced off the wall.

He staggered for a moment before collapsing to the ground.

With Harper writhing on the outfield grass, center fielder Denard Span had to come in to field the ball.

By then, Ellis was on third base with a triple.

Cuts: Harper needed 11 stitches to close the wound

Bloodied: Harper was left with blood on his neck and throat as a result of the misstep

True grit: Though the collision rattled Harper, it doesn't appear that it will slow him down

Span later told ESPN: 'You could tell he didn't know where he was at. He just kept asking me, "Is it bad? Is it bad?"'

Harper rolled onto his back and eventually got up under his own power, with streaks of blood seen on his neck and throat as he walked off the field.

Though the collision appeared to rattle Harper, it doesn't look like it will slow him down.

This afternoon, he tweeted: 'I will keep playing this game hard for the rest of my life even if it kills me! Ill never stop!'

Support: Teammates and trainers tend to Harper after he collided with the wall at Dodger Stadium on Monday

Harper, one of Major League Baseball's youngest players, made his debut in the same stadium on April 28, 2012.

A day later, in just his second major league game, he crashed into the centerfield wall while making a catch, injuring his back

It was the right fielder's second game back after missing two games with an ingrown toenail.

The Nationals, who were up 6-0 when Harper went down, hung on to win the game 6-2.
