A video that was filmed over the summer shows a New York City police officer threatening a teen just moments before knocking him out - and all reportedly over a cigarette.

Lawyers for Marcel Hamer of Brooklyn, New York, claim the 17-year-old was walking home from school on June 4 when a plainclothes police officer stopped the boy, believing the cigarette he was smoking was marijuana.

It is uncertain what happens immediately after the boy was stopped, but as the video shows, it ends with the officer hitting Hamer so hard as he lays on the ground that the young boy appears to be knocked unconscious. 

Pleading: Marcel Hamer was threatened and hit by an unknown officer during an incident that happened on June 4 of the year (above)

Video: Hamer's friends taped the incident, which shows the officer asking the boy if he wants to get 'f***ed up' before hitting him

Now, his family is saying the young man has suffered from headaches, dizziness, and memory loss since the incident.

The video opens with Hamer laying on the ground and pleading with the officer that it was 'just a cigarette,' as the cop screams at the teen, 'Do you wanna get f***ed up?'

The officer then goes even further, letting the boy's friends he is fine with them filming the incident, seeming to imply he does not believe he is doing anything wrong. 

'Yeah, get it on film,' he tells the high school students. 

The sound of Hamer being hit is heard soon after and then the boy's entire body goes limp.

A second man, who appears to also be an undercover officer, runs over and helps the first cop put cuffs on the seemingly unconscious teen, and at one point reaches into his back pocket as seen in the video, which was released by The Brooklyn Paper. 

The names of the officers are not known at this time. 

Brutality: After being struck by the officer, Hamer appears to go limp and seems unconscious 

'If what happened on this video was reversed and Marcel assaulted this officer in the same exact manner, Marcel would be prosecuted, and this officer should be prosecuted for what he did,' said attorney James Ross, who is handling the family’s civil suit.

He added that Hamer was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and pleaded guilty to a violation.

The NYPD said the incident is under investigation by the department’s Internal Affairs Bureau.
