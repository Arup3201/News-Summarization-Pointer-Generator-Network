An experienced skydiver who was part of a group trying to carry out a mid-air formation maneuver died after getting caught in another jumper's parachute.

Ken Oka, 62, of Mira Loma, California, was unable to open his spare parachute as he spun out of control and fell into the backyard of a house in Lake Elsinore.

Police found him outside the house on the 19000 block of Sweetwood Lane shortly after 3pm on Saturday and he was taken to hospital with serious injuries. He was pronounced dead about half an hour later.

Ken Oka, 62, was killed Saturday in a skydiving accident in Lake Elsinore, California

Federal Aviation Administration is conducting an independent investigation, police said.

Mr Oka was a very experienced jumper who regularly performed complex manoeuvres and even 
held his own annual skydiving competition - the Oka Cup -  a friend 
said.

According to friends he had accumulated 5000 jumps during his lifetime. He had even been skydiving twice before his death on Saturday.

Mr Oka's girlfriend Lynn Collins tearfully spoke to KCAL-TV and said that he once told her, 'I want to do this [until] the day I die.'

The two met eleven years ago and on their first date he took her skydiving.

'People should know that that guy absolutely loved the sport. He loved the diving, he loved all the people in it,' said his friend Craig Stapleton.  'We are going to miss him so much'.

Mr Stapleton, a safety advisor at Parachute Center in Acampo, said his friend was fun-loving and his annual competition was a light-hearted event which had run since 1992.

Mr Oka would hide chocolate eggs or beer for people to find, give out 'silly-looking' trophies as prizes and throw toy soldiers with parachutes out of planes at the Cup, he said.

Oka was also fan of motorcycles and skiing

He said formation dives involved jumpers holding onto the lines or fabrics of others' parachutes, but there is a risk of getting tangled and some people carry knives just in case.

In a 2004 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Mr Oka described taking part in a formation jump.

He said: 'You literally wrap your foot in your teammate's parachute line and you try to fly this (formation) very uniformly together.

His girlfriend Lynn Collins tearfully spoke to KCAL-TV and told them how Oka died doing what he loved best

When they met eleven years ago Oka took Collins skydiving

'The thought of danger, I guess, plays in there someplace, but that is 
nowhere near the top. It's just fun with your friends up 
there, aligning the parachutes and being able to do this skill.'

Mr Oka was also a fan of motorcycling and skiing, said Collins.

Mr Oka's death follows a previous skydiving accident in the area this year, when Caleb Medley was killed in a Marine training accident in February.
