Seven News reports that 'Australia is gaining a reputation worldwide and it's not good. A place where holiday makers are ripped off.' 

'The message to tourists is don't come back to Australia because it’s a rip-off place, everything is ridiculously expensive,' Australian businessman Dick Smith told Seven News.

'It's an outrage that we're having to pay these extreme prices, not just expensive bottles of water, but it's digital products and services, it's cosmetics, clothing,' Choice’s Tom Godfrey told Seven News.

'Australia is being slapped with a tax on these products unnecessarily,' he said.
