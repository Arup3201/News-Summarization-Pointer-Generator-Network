If you often find yourself trailing your hand over luxurious clothing in a shop, you might be more tempted to blow your shopping budget, scientists claim.

Touching items in a shop can make you more prone to buying them, according to a recent study.

To combat the effect, a financial writer has suggested using the ‘one finger rule’ to satisfy the desire to touch, but prevent undesirable financial consequences.

A UCLA study found that by merely touching an object (pictured) it increases a shopper's attachment to it as they feel as if they own it and also value it more highly than if they had not touched it

The study, by the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) investigated whether touching an object influences a consumer’s perception of it.

They found that by merely touching an object it increases a shopper’s attachment to it as they feel as if they own it and also value it more highly than if they had not touched it.

It is the first study to investigate the effect of touch on buyers, whereas 25 years of previous research has repeatedly shown that consumers’ valuation of an object increases once they have taken ownership of it, which is known as the endowment effect.

Finance expert Kim McGrigg, who is based in Denver, came up with the ‘one finger rule’ to reduce the effect in shoppers, Lifehacker reported.

‘You can touch anything you want, but only with one finger as it satisfies the desire to touch without implying ownership, which makes shoppers less likely to blow their budget and overspend,’ she said.

Another study from the University of Wisconsin found that some people have trouble deciding whether to buy an object if they can’t touch it.

Scientists confirmed that touching a product boosts a person’s sense of ownership over it so that handling goods is very close to owning them in a shopper’s mind.

They believe that shoppers should understand the power of touch to stand any chance of not getting carried away on a shopping trip and marketers work hard to exploit the vulnerability in a field called haptic research.

However, an MIT study in 2010 found that humans learn to want to touch things in infancy to gather information quickly, so it is hard to resist the temptation all together.

Ms McGrigg came up with the one finger rule after a visit to a museum with 30 children who were only allowed to touch animal pelts with one finger – so they behaved but were satisfying with the interaction, according to Money Management.
