A frail 80-year-old widow received a letter informing her that she had died - thanks to an error by her pension provider.

Standard Life sent 'condolences' in the message to her address, where she has lived alone for years. The letter also made clear that her pension payments had been stopped.

The woman, whose identity was not revealed, said she was 'extremely upset' by the letter, which is dated July 2014 and refers to a payment the previous month.
