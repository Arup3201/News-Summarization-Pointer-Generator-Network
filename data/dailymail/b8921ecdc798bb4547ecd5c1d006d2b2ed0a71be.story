Connelly appeared before a Parole Board panel at the end of July

THE family of Baby P reacted with fury yesterday as the mother  who allowed him to be tortured to death prepared for her release from prison.

Tracey Connelly is expected to walk out of jail within 24 hours after being granted parole yesterday.

The 32-year-old was jailed indefinitely and ordered to serve a minimum of five years in May 2009 for causing or allowing her son Peter’s death, but the Parole Board believes she is no longer a danger to the public.

Freedom: Tracey Connelly, 32, left, is set to walk free from prison after a decision by a three member Parole Board panel.  She was jailed indefinitely with a 
minimum of five years in May 2009 for causing or allowing the death of 
her son Peter - known by his case workers as Baby P (right)

With time on remand following her arrest in 2007, Connelly has served longer than five years.

The
 decision to release her has appalled relatives of Baby P who died at 
his mother’s flat in Tottenham, North London, in 2007. The 17-month-old 
had more than 50 injuries, including a broken back.

Yesterday
 a relative of Baby P’s father said: ‘I have been dreading this day for 
years and it’s finally come around. This is a real kick in the teeth. 
She should have served much longer. In my view she should never have 
been let out. This is not justice.’

He
 added that Peter’s father and siblings ‘are attempting to get on with 
their lives as a family and I don’t know how this is going to affect 
them’.

Connelly had 
admitted doing nothing while Peter was tortured to death by her 
boyfriend Steven Barker and his paedophile brother Jason Owen.

The
 case provoked a national scandal after it emerged that social workers, 
police and doctors missed a series of warning signs that could have 
saved the child’s life.

She is understood to be currently detained at Low Newton jail near Durham (pictured)

Owen
 was freed on licence in 2011 but returned to jail in April this year 
after breaching parole conditions. Barker was given an indefinite 
sentence with a tariff of ten years.

Still inside: Jason Owen, 37, was one of three people jailed over the death of Baby P. He is back in prison after breaching his parole conditions

Yesterday
 officials were debating moving Connelly from Low Newton jail near 
Durham to another prison prior to her release to protect her from attack
 by vigilantes.

She will 
then be taken to a probation hostel away from London. Connelly has not 
been given a new identity, but will be encouraged to change her name by 
deed poll.

She has been given tips on how to hide her true identity and change her appearance after she received death threats.

She already looks different from her police mugshot after ballooning to 22st in prison.

She will be seen every week by probation officials and prohibited from returning to Haringey, North London.

After a stint in the probation hostel, Connelly will be allowed to move into a private home.

But she will be banned from contacting her remaining three children by Baby P’s father and her youngest child by Barker.

Social services will be alerted should she get pregnant again and would almost certainly apply to have the baby taken into care.

She
 will remain on licence for the rest of her life and will be recalled to
 custody if she breaches the conditions of her licence.
