Joan Collins has spoken on camera for the first time about being raped by her future husband Maxwell Reed in a new documentary tackling sexual violence.

The 81-year-old actress, who has previously written about the ordeal in her autobiography, tells how she was drugged and raped at the age of 17 when she was still a virgin and explains how her guilt drove her to marry the perpetrator of the crime.

The emotional admission appears in Brave Miss World, a film which sees former Israeli Miss World, Linor Abargil, travel the globe meeting fellow victims. Linor was raped in 1998, six weeks before she was crowned Miss World and has made it her life's mission to encourage other women to speak out.

Joan Collins in Brave New World: The speaks on camera for the first time about being raped by her future husband Maxwell Reed in the inspiring  documentary

In the documentary, a sombre Joan  tells the former beauty queen of the harrowing ordeal.

'I was raped when I was seventeen years old,' says the star. At the time the actress had just been signed to RANK film studios and was already tipped for success.

Joan then describes how she was on a date with Irish actor Maxwell Reed (who died in 1974), when he went to take a bath. He gave her a rum and coke to drink and some books to read.

'The books were porn, which I’d never seen before. Hardcore porn,' the 81-year-old remembers.

What happened next has stayed etched in the the actress's memory for the last 64 years. 

'The next thing I knew, I was out flat on the sofa in that living room and he was raping me. And what he had given me was a drug. He had drugged my drink. 

'It was what is called in those days a Mickey Finn. Which I think today would be Rohypnol. It felt so horrible. That I...that I'd done this thing.'

In her naivety, a young Joan Collins felt terrible guilt.

'It wasn’t my fault but I didn’t know, I went out with him. And maybe I shouldn’t have gone out with him. He was much older than me, and he was a famous star,' she says.

'And anyway the bottom line is that he called me, and I went out with him again. And after I'd been going out with him for a few months, he asked me to marry him. 

'And I thought, "Well I better because you know, he took my virginity." I really hated him, but I was so filled with guilt, that he had done this thing to me.'

The actress then admits. 'It took a long time to be able to really trust any man.'

Talking about the interview, 34-year-old Linor tells the MailOnline, 'It was very emotional to hear how Joan had felt so guilty about losing her virginity to this older man who had drugged and raped her, that she felt she had to marry him.

'She was so young at the time, and she entered into an abusive marriage. The post-rape circumstances are very different for a rape victim than for any other crime.

'We automatically try to minimize the impact of the abuse, which is something that is often not understood by police or society. A rape victim may not feel safe or able to report for a very long time.' 

The former model, who was attacked whilst working as a model in Milan, says it took guts for the Hollywood actress to speak out. 'When Joan found out about the film, she decided she would help us. It’s not something any of us want to do - to go on camera and talk about having been raped.

'But when you know that speaking up can give others the courage to come forward and press charges, and how many others will be saved by putting a rapist in prison, you want to do it,' says the mother of three. 

Filmed over five years and directed by Cecelia Peck, daughter of legendary actor Gregory Peck, the documentary, which shows Linor's meeting victims from American college students to young South Africans living in poverty, received a standing ovation at its UK premiere at The Jewish Film Festival last week.

Linor, who has since found religion and swapped bikinis for a head scarf, says the documentary was one of the hardest things she's ever done, but says she learnt so much from the experience.

'It made me grateful to live in Israel, where I was able to convict my rapist.  In India, in Pakistan and many other countries in the Middle East, if a woman spoke out about sexual violence she would be treated like a criminal herself. Those are the places where there is still so much to be done,' she says.

'But most rapes are committed by someone you know, in the family, in the workplace, in the community, in school, and this makes it very hard to speak up.'

For Linor, the most powerful tonic during her ordeal was the support of her mother. 'Without my mum I could never have recovered.

'She gave me support from the moment it happened. She never made me feel ashamed or that it was my fault. I wish every daughter who survives a rape or assault, has a mother like mine.'

Linor's terrifying assault happened when she was 18, six weeks before she was crowned Miss World.

'I had just been through the worst thing in my life and I had not begun to recover,' Linor says remembering the moment she was crowned. 'I was in shock because I didn’t expect to win. A Miss Israel had never won the crown. I didn’t think it was possible.

'It all hit me at once when the crown was put on my head. I didn’t know what would become of me or what would happen, but I knew it was for a reason, and now I know: it’s so that I can help other women not to stay silent.'

The trial of Linor's rapist took place during the year she was Miss World, but throughout she refused to have her name  or face concealed in media coverage, insisting that there was no reason to be ashamed. 'It was a very hard time,' she says.

'My rapist ended up being convicting and sentenced to 16 years in prison. After the trial I spoke out and said to all the women in Israel should not to be afraid to report the crime if it happened to them.

'Then I was quiet for ten years. I needed to heal. In 1998, Motty Reif (the film's producer) encouraged me to make a film about my story and the stories of other women. 

'We went to Los Angeles to find the right team, and we met our director, Cecilia Peck and our producer and editor Inbal Lessner.' 

'I wanted to encourage women not to stay silent, and not to blame themselves. I didn’t know how hard it would be, but I felt that it was my mission.'

During the filming Linor suffered PTSD, but was determined to complete the project, which inspired those working with her as well as the thousands others that will benefit from seeing the final product.

Director, Cecilia, says, 'Linor felt that she had recovered from the brutal rape crime, and was ready to reach out to other women.'

'But traveling around the world and hearing the stories of other survivors triggered her own trauma over and over, and she began to suffer symptoms of PTSD,' she explains.

'We never pushed her to continue, but her determination, in the face of how hard it was on her, was very motivating to all of us who worked on the film. 

'Her transformation from teenage rape victim, beauty queen, and Israeli super model; into a religious mother, lawyer, and outspoken advocate on behalf of women around the world, was an epic, transformative narrative that unfolded over the five years we filmed with her.'

Cecilia says the film's website has become a focal point for victims to speak out. Hundreds of thousands have visited the site, with many writing about the abuse they experienced and hundreds of emails arrive each day.

For Linor, hearing from victims who are unable to seek justice has been the hardest part of the filming experience. 

'I've been overwhelmed by how many women are suffering because they weren’t believed or given support,' she says

'For myself, and so many women I spoke to, it’s so important to seek help, whether it’s from your family, a trusted friend, or a help line. Some women don't have access to justice, but you can’t heal if you keep it inside.'
