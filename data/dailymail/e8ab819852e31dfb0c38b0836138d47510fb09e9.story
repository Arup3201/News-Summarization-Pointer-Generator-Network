A Tennessee pastor seeking to encourage better behavior in after-church diners has created a website where restaurant servers can vent about the 'rude, impatient and lousy tippers' who are the bane of their every Sunday.

The site, called Sundays are the Worst, launched on March 2 and will run until Easter Sunday.

Chad Roberts, pastor at Preaching Christ Church in Downtown Kingsport began the campaign after hearing about St Louis Applebees server who waited on pastor Alois Bell and received, instead of a tip, a note that read 'I give God ten per cent, why do you get 18?'

Unholy: Servers have inundated the site with horror stories about the behavior of Christians who dine out on Sundays after church

'We started seeing these terrible comments people were writing - "this is why I don't go to church," "this is why I hate christians," "this is what Christians are like" Roberts told ABC 19.

He decided he wanted to do something about the 'church crowd' and help change the attitudes of both servers and church-goers.

'The two goals we have with this are number one, that Christians would begin to realize that their attitude really matters when they go to eat,' Roberts said.

'The second goal is that particularly unchurched servers would understand that not all Christians are rude, impatient, lousy tippers. That’s what we want to communicate.'

Since its launch, Sundays Are The Worst has already been inundated with missives from servers whose experiences with Christians are nothing short of unholy.

Christians are, on the whole, cheap, arrogant and rude, according to the servers' experiences chronicled on the site. Common experiences include being left fake money which actually turns out to be a religious tract instead of a tip, being abused for working on a holy day, and being gypped on the tip.

Campaign: Pastor Chad Roberts wants Christians to change their behavior towards servers

'You people are the rudest, nastiest, most unappreciative people we as restaurant workers, have EVER waited on. You ask any restaurant worker, Sunday’s are the worst! From the comments, “You shouldn’t be open!” to “Your going to hell for not being in church!” It’s funny though, for if we were not working… you people wouldn’t EAT! (sic)' fumed one.

'... It is not only after church that Christians are viewed as poor customers. It is well known among servers that the more “Christian” a customer appeared to be, the more likely it would be that they would be rude and tip badly. If a table started praying before the meal we knew not to expect to be tipped well, if at all,' wrote another.

'The single thread that flows through all of this behavior is the arrogance. The idea that leaving a tract (i.e. pushing your religious views down someones throat while they are trying to work) is acceptable period, let alone a reasonable substitute for paying for a service you receive,' wrote another server.

Stingy: Tennessee servers say Sundays are their busiest yet least profitable day

Arrogant: This waitperson was treated badly by a group of women who then 'gave her tip to Jesus'

'The quote many servers have heard “I give God 10% so why should I give you 15%?”, as though tithing makes someone too good to pay for services they receive. (Please note that they always say 15%, despite the fact that 15% has not been an acceptable level of tipping for the past two decades. 15% is what you are supposed to give for poor service.) (sic)'

Roberts and his team are responding with a personal written apology to each hospitality worker who leaves a story on the site.

Each week during the campaign, one server who has shared their story will receive a Food City gift card that can be redeemed for groceries or gas.

'It’s a way for our church to tell the serving community that we’re sorry for what you have to go through on Sundays and that we really do appreciate you and what you do for our community,' Roberts said.

The pastor has asked his congregation to double the tip amount if they dine out at a restaurant on Easter Sunday, when the campaign will end.

Roberts intends to start is up again at the same time next year.
