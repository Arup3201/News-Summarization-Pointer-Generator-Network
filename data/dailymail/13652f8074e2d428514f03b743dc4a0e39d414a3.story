An Arizona teenager has learned the hard way that he was no Santa Claus.

Firefighters in Tucson had to rescue the unnamed 16-year-old boy from a chimney Wednesday afternoon after he forgot his keys and tried to enter the house from the roof.

Fire Department Capt. Barrett Baker said they were alerted to the emergency at around 3pm by a neighbor who heard cries for help coming from a home near Glenn Street and Columbus Boulevard.

Chim-chimeney! A 16-year-old boy had to be rescued from a chimney in Tucson, Arizona, after he got stuck trying to enter his home 

First responders who arrived on the scene found the wannabe Kris Kringle lodged about 6 feet below the top of the chimney.

The firefighters tossed the teen a rope, which was then used to pull him out to safety, reported KGUN9.

The boy emerged from the chimney caked in soot, but he was otherwise unharmed and did not require medical help.

In a post written on the department's Facebook page, firefighters urged people never to repeat the boy's chimney stunt.

‘Kids, leave this to Santa,’ read the status update. ‘The chances of making it down safely are slim to none and getting stuck can lead to serious injury or even death.’

Incredibly, this was not the first time that firefighters in Arizona were called to rescue a child trapped inside a chimney.

In December, a 13-year-old from Scottsdale found himself in a similar situation when he tried to enter his home after getting locked out.

Two months earlier, a woman got stuck inside a chimney in Ventura county, California, during a suspected break-in, requiring firefighters to chisel away much of the smokestack and lubricate it with dish soap.

In a similar incident, a 25-year-old man found himself lodged inside a chimney in Florida back in November 2013, when he tried to enter a home to steal money for alcohol.
