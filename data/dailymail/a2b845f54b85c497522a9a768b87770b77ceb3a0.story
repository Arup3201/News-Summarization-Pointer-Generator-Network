The woman writer who accuses Dominique Strauss-Kahn of attacking her appeared on prime-time TV across France last night to claim: ‘If I had not been very lucky, it would have ended in a rape.’

Tristane Banon’s broadcast came 24 hours after the former International Monetary Fund boss broke his silence about two alleged sex crimes.

In a television interview, the 62-year-old said that both Miss Banon, 32, and Nafissatou Diallo, a 32-year-old New York chamber maid who accused him of attacking her in May, were liars.

But appearing on Canal+ television 
news, Miss Banon explained why she filed a formal complaint in July 
alleging that Mr Strauss-Kahn tried to rape her in a Paris flat eight 
years ago.

‘My light-heartedness: I lost it on February 11th 2003,’ she said.

‘This man made me come to a flat...for an interview. He double locked, leaving the keys in the door.

‘Very quickly, we were fighting, it turned bad. If I had not been very lucky, it would have ended in a rape.’

Asked why she had not reported the 
attempted rape at the time, Ms Banon said: ‘When I see the way in which 
I’m crushed today, I say to myself that if I had reported it at the time
I would have been on the verge of suicide.’

Miss Banon was interviewed on Canal+ television news , the day after Strauss-Kahn’s appearance on TF1.

Ms
Banon, who was accompanied by her lawyer David Koubbi, filed her case 
in July after Mr Strauss-Kahn’s arrest in New York for allegedly 
attacking Ms Diallo.

The 
American case collapsed after Mr Strauss-Kahn’s successfully claimed 
that his sexual relations with Ms Diallo had been consensual – something
she still denies.

On Sunday, Strauss-Kahn claimed 
during his interview, that his encounter with hotel maid had been ‘a 
moral failing’ rather than attempted rape.

Strauss-Kahn
did not deny there had been an encounter with Banon, but said: ‘I was 
interviewed as a witness. I told the truth that in this meeting there 
had been no aggression, no violence, I will say no more.

‘The version that has been reported is imaginary, slanderous,’ he added.

Paris
prosecutors have not decided whether or not to charge Strauss-Kahn in 
the Banon case. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
