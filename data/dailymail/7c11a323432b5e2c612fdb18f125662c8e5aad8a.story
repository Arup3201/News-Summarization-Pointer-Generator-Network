For more than three decades it has represented a powerful protest against nuclear weapons and their presence on Scottish soil.

But the days of the Faslane Peace Camp may be numbered – due to lack of interest.

Set up during the Cold War, the camp has attracted thousands of protesters to the nuclear submarine base on the Clyde.

The Faslane Peace Camp has represented a powerful protest against nuclear weapons and their presence on Scottish soil for three decades

Some stayed in Dunbartonshire for only a few days, while others were residents for months and even years.

Since the camp was established on the shores of the Gare Loch in 1982, there had been an average of least 20 permanent residents – but that has fallen dramatically in recent years.

The permanent complement is now only four. If they cannot find at least another four protesters, they will leave in June.

The protesters say it is 'regrettable' and that the symbolism of having to dismantle the camp in the run-up to a referendum on Scottish independence represents the 'worst possible timing'

Residents are concerned that the diminishing numbers means they will have to dismantle the 30-year-old peace camp

The camp was set up by anti-nuclear protesters Bobby and Margaret Harrison, who pitched their tent beside the A814

On their website, the protesters say it is ‘regrettable’ and that the symbolism of having to dismantle the camp in the run-up to a referendum on Scottish independence represents the ‘worst possible timing’.

The news is a major blow for the anti-nuclear weapons movement, coming weeks after protests against Trident, including a blockade at Faslane.

Police arrested 47 protesters outside the base, which is a mile from the campsite, after campaigners chained themselves together.

There are now only four protestors at the Faslane camp campaigning against nuclear arms

The collective was granted a lease on the plot by the then Strathclyde Regional Council for a peppercorn rent of £1 a month

Campaigners say that while the moral reason for the camp remains, there has been a failure in the peace movement to bring on young supporters

The fledgling collective was granted a lease on the plot by the then Strathclyde Regional Council for a peppercorn rent of £1 a month.

The Harrisons left after several months but they were followed by thousands of activists.

Angus Chalmers, 20, of Edinburgh, who has lived in the camp for two years, is one of the final four protesters.

He said: ‘The camp was founded in the Cold War era and while that threat has receded, the moral argument and the principle remains. But there has been a failure in the peace movement to bring on young people.

Even if the camp closes, the anti-nuclear weapons campaign will continue, said Scottish CND chairman Arthur West

Thousands of activists have lived at the camp which protests the use of nuclear technology and nuclear weapons that are stored at Faslane

‘We have wanted to grow a wider movement and get people to commit to living here but we will have to wait and see if we can continue.’

Even if the camp closes, the anti-nuclear weapons campaign will continue, said Scottish CND chairman Arthur West.

He added: ‘There’s an element of personal sacrifice involved in the camp, where people live in austere conditions, so it’s unclear if they will find anyone. 

‘But my message to the Scottish Government and Westminster is that the peace movement is alive and kicking.’
