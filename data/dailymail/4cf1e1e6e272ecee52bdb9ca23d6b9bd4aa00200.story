Miley Cyrus was given antibiotics after becoming 'extremely worn down' in the wake of the death of her dog Floyd.

Sources close to the star told TMZ the singer had an 'emotional meltdown' after Floyd's death, was 'partying hard' and claimed she has been an 'emotional mess' ever since.

Miley is said to have been suffering 'crying fits and has been unable to sleep.' The source claims the singer was on medication because she became ill from being 'extremely worn down'.

The Wrecking Ball singer was hospitalized on Tuesday after a statement released said she suffered 'a severe allergic reaction' to medication and forced to cancel a concert in Kansas City, Missouri.

A statement from the Sprint Center arena where she was scheduled to perform said that Miley suffered a 'severe allergic reaction' to antibiotics.

A spokesman for the star told MailOnline he had no comment at this time.

 sudden illness has forced her to cancel a second show in as many weeks,
 after fans in Charlotte, North Carolina on Monday were left 
disappointed when she cancelled just 30 minutes before show time on 
April 8th.

Still tweeting: Miley has been updating fans from her hospital bed on her condition, but the audience in St.Louis will be disappointed as Wednesday night's show is cancelled

At the time the 21-year-old singer was said to have been diagnosed with flu and told to rest by doctors, according to a message on the Time Warner Cable arena's website but some concertgoers had already arrived for the Bangerz tour date before the announcement, only to be turned away.

On Wednesday Miley again updated fans on her condition from her hospital bed, informing them that she would not be released from hospital in time for her tour date in St.Louis.

Miley was scheduled to perform at the 
Sprint Center in Kansas City on Tuesday night, but the show was 
cancelled due to her hospitalisation.

The
 singer has been placed on medical rest by doctors, according to the 
statement, with no indication as yet given when she will resume the 
tour.

Refunds were being offered at the point of ticket purchase with online and phone orders being automatically refunded.

Break down: Miley sung to a giant inflatable of her dog just a few days after his death on stage on Brooklyn

Weeping: She could hardly hold back her tears as she belted out Can't Be Tamed

Her hospitalization comes after the singer tweeted on Sunday and on Monday about having flu-like symptoms. It is the latest blow for Miley, who is still grieving the death of her beloved dog Floyd.

The Alaskan Klee Kai is believed to have been attacked by a coyote last week in Los Angeles, while Miley was on tour.

A few days after her dogâ€™s death Miley paid an emotional tribute to him by singing to a huge inflatable likeness of her pet while performing in Brooklyn.

The distraught star got down on her knees and while crying she sang a tearful and touching version of her song Canâ€™t Be Tamed in his honour.

Wearing just a bra, underwear and black and white furry chaps, Miley appeared inconsolable in a video posted by blogger Perez Hilton on his Instagram page.

And she has been seen sobbing in the street, as she walked with a new puppy given to her by her parents, which she later returned saying it was just too soon.
