Pope John Paul II has finally approved for Sainthood thanks to a Costa Rican woman who claims the late Pope cured her fatal brain aneurysm.

Floribeth Mora, now 50, made a miraculous recovery from a potentially deadly aneurysm in her cerebral artery two years ago, after a photograph of John Paul II spoke to her, she claims.

Mora's recovery, which her doctor attests there is no scientific basis for, was finally recognized by the Vatican as a valid second miracle for the late Pope's sainthood.

Mora was diagnosed with a swelling in her brain in April 2011, she told reporters at Roman Catholic Church's headquarters in San Jose.

Though originally thought to be a severe migraine, after three days of pain, Mora returned to the hospital, where a series of tests revealed an aneurysm on the right side of her brain that had begun to hemorrhage.

Doctors then told Mora that she would die within the month, she told Reuters.

Mora was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm that she says doctors told her would kill her within a month. However, she claims that the late Pope John Paul II spoke to her and cured her disease

'I returned home with the horror of imminent death. Seeing my children walking by looking at me, standing beside my bed, seeing my husband making himself strong, taking my hand and crossing himself every night, it was very sad,' Mora said.

Mora went on to testify that after watching the beatification of Pope John Paul II on television she heard a voice speak from his picture on the cover of a magazine.

Mora fell asleep after watching the mass and when she awoke heard a voice from the picture of John Paul II which sat on top of her television saying 'get up,'

'I woke up when I heard a voice that said 'get up,'' Mora told reporters holding up a news clipping. 'I was alone in my room, I only had this clipping that was published around those dates to commemorate John Paul II's papacy.'

"I had it in front of me and I heard a voice again that said 'get up' and I looked at his photo and saw his open arms and I heard a voice that said 'be not afraid' and I said 'Yes Lord,'' she said through tears.

Mora claims that after the picture spoke to her she instantly knew she was cured.

Mora's (front left) husband Edwin Arce (front right) told reporters that many have doubted the veracity of the miracle over the past two years

'I went to my husband and he asked me what I was doing and I just said 'I feel fine, I feel fine, I feel fine,'' she said.

The Costa Rican grandmother claims that miracle took place after she was told by doctors that she had less than a month to live, a written statement distributed by the church attests.

However, her neurosurgeon, Alejandro Vargas, denies he ever told his pious patient any such thing.

Though Vargas does admit Mora's condition was potentially fatal, he says he predicted only a two percent chance that the aneurysm would kill her, possibly bleeding into her brain within a year of the diagnosis, Reuters reported.

Mora, 50, cried as she told reporters of the miracle the late John Paul II performed on her as he was finally made eligible for sainthood

'She was sent home with medication that would reduce her blood pressure and was advised to improve her diet so as not to raise her cholesterol levels and thus decrease the chance of her having a second bleeding episode,' Dr. Vargas told the news service.

'She was sedated because the headaches were too sharp. We didn't send her home to be sedated and wait until she died in her sleep.'

However the neurologist does admit that Mora's recovery is inexplicable from a medical standpoint.

'The risk for Floribeth was death, or ending up with significant neurological damage,' Dr. Vagas said.

'What we found remarkable, unbelievable really, was that by November there was absolutely no trace in her brain that she ever had an aneurysm,' he told Reuters. 'I had never seen this in my career.'

Mora, who at the press conference wore gold rosary beads, posted about her miracle on a blog dedicated to Pope John Paul II, and it was soon picked up as a rallying point for Catholics who supported his canonization.

However, according to Mora's husband Erwin Arce not everyone was so quick to accept a miracle had occurred.

'We've faced a lot of non-believers these last two years,' Arce told Reuters.

Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005, was finally declared a saint by the Vatican after his second miracle of curing a Costa Rican woman of a nearly fatal brain aneurysm was recognized

Pope John Paul II was one of the fastest Pope's to ever be canonized after his death, in a period of only 8 years

The night Mora heard the Pope's voice her family constructed a shrine to him on their porch, which now includes the original doctor's note diagnosing Mora with a brain aneurysm, the news service reported.

Theis latest miracle approved by Pope Francis will make Pope John Paul II one of the fastest members of the Catholic church to achieve sainthood, USA Today reported.

Pope John Paul II died in 2005.

The Vatican also announced that along with John Paul II, John XXIII will be canonized, the paper reported. John XXIII was pope from 1958 to 1963 and though he doesn't have two confirmed miracles under his belt, Francis waved the rules as he believe John XXIII deserved sainthood based on his own merits, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombard told the paper.

The two Popes will be canonized within the year according to the Vatican.
