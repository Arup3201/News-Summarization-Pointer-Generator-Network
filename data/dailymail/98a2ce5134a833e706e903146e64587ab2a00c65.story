Everton rewared a number of lucky fans with the club's first official Blues on Tour event for the trip to Burnley on Sunday.

The Toffees laid on free coach travel to Turf Moor from Goodison Park for 150 Evertonians who follow Roberto Martinez's home and away.

Blues supporters were treated to ninety minutes of entertainment in a bar close to Burnley's stadium before the Everton team impressed the travelling faithful with a 3-1 victory against the struggling Clarets.

Fans also enjoyed free food at the event while one fan took to Twitter to show his delight at winning a signed Leighton Baines shirt.

Toffees legend Ian Snodin, who attended the trip, said: 'I have had a great laugh today, from the moment we left Goodison at 9.30am this morning to when we arrived back victorious. All the fans travelling with us have really enjoyed themselves; some even got involved with the dancing and singing in the bar! I'm already looking forward to being on board for the next time we go on the road with Blues on Tour.'

One travelling Toffee added: 'I've had such a great day. Everything put on by the club was top class and I couldn't fault anything. The entertainment was fantastic and it's been a really enjoyable and different way to spend an away day.

The Blues on Tour initiative was newly introduced this season as part of the Premier League’s Away Fan Initiative. Further trips are planned later this season with details to be confirmed in due course. 

Everton, who had a total of nearly 4,000 supporters in the Turf Moor away end, sealed victory courtesy of a brace from Samuel Eto'o and Romelu Lukaku strike as the Toffees moved into the top half of the Barclays Premier League table - two points behind rivals Liverpool and Arsenal.
