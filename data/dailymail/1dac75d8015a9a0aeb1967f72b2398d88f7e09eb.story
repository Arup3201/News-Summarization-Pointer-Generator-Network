It might not be the kind of race that United and Liverpool fans are used to, but the battle for fourth spot and Champions League football could come down to the two great rivals.

Everton and Tottenham fans might disagree but, despite their ongoing struggles, sooner or later United will go on a run. Seven points is a big gap, but it’s not insurmountable.

Liverpool still have to go to Old Trafford and United can turn it around, particularly when Robin van Persie, Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney combine. There is absolutely no love lost between the clubs, so it will be a real test of nerve. Whatever happens, it will be a game-changer for either side.

Liverpool have been without Champions 
League football for three seasons now, so to get back in would be huge.

They could attract more players and increase the chances of hanging onto
 the likes of Luis Suarez for the long term.

For
 United, dropping out of Europe’s top competition is almost 
unthinkable.  They have been in it since 1995 and the impact would be 
massive financially and for keeping their best players.

It’s a hard job picking the best signing of the transfer window.

We have not seen them all play and some will take time to settle, but you would be hard pressed to find a more exciting player than Wilfried Zaha.

He has barely featured for Manchester United, but we are not always privy to what happens on the training ground so can’t say why he’s not been playing.

But he is a talent that gets bums off seats.

He had an instant impact on Saturday, hugging the touchline, as his pitch map (right) shows, and setting up a goal.

In 52 minutes he achieved more than in his two games for United and I’m sure Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will want to unleash him in the Welsh derby on Saturday Night Football.

Only a few months ago I was talking to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and he had his knee in a brace. He won’t have felt further from the World Cup, but against Crystal Palace he was back with a bang.

Roy Hodgson will see him as a real option now and the good news is there won’t be any worries about him playing too much football and being fatigued. He’s a nice lad and he’ll be chomping at the bit. And don’t forget he knows what it’s like to score in the Maracana...

Southampton lost form before Christmas but at Fulham, they were back to their best. 

In Adam Lallana and Jay Rodriguez they have two of England’s best young players and they were exceptional.

Lallana scored from a tight angle while Rodriguez went one better with a superb curling effort. Don’t be surprised if both end up on the plane to Brazil in the summer.

Charlie Adam never really achieved hero status at Liverpool but, with two goals and a win against United on Saturday, I’m sure he will have had the fans on Merseyside smiling.

There was more than a touch of fortune about his first goal, which took a huge deflection to beat David de Gea, but there was nothing lucky about his second — it was an absolute screamer right into the top corner.

Adam has always had that kind of power in his locker and he unleashed it to devastating effect.

I have always been a fan of Adam and his sweet left  foot is capable of winning matches. What a way to prove it.

Kevin Nolan was back among the goals on Saturday and that is no surprise. Why? Andy Carroll is back.

I played against Nolan and he was one of the best players at making late runs to become the third man in attack.

He was like a magnet to knock-downs.

That’s exactly what he did against Swansea, benefiting from two of Carroll’s headers to score.

He had the same relationship with Kevin Davies at Bolton and though the style might not always be appreciated by the West Ham faithful, they will certainly appreciate those goals.

I watched QPR’s 3-3 draw with Burnley on Saturday lunchtime and it was one of the games of the weekend.

There were some excellent performances with plenty of players who would be at home in the Premier League. Burnley’s young right back Kieran Trippier is one of the best passers I’ve seen in his position while Danny Ings underlined his quality with yet another goal.

Kevin Doyle made a good debut for QPR and Joey Barton, the league’s best midfielder, was excellent. Just three points separate the sides, so this promotion race could go to the wire.
