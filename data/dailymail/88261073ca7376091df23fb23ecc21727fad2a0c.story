A US Army National Guard solider and his cousin have been arrested for attempting to join ISIS and planning a  'Charlie Hebdo' style terrorist attack on home soil.

Specialist Hasan Edmonds, 22, a U.S. citizen and member of the Illinois National Guard, was arrested on Wednesday at Chicago Midway International Airport by members of the Chicago FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) while trying to fly to Cairo, Egypt, the Department of Justice said in a statement.

His cousin, Jonas Edmonds, 29, who is also a U.S. citizen, was arrested without incident at his home in Aurora, Illinois, on the same day. 

The pair have posed for pictures together on Facebook, while Hasan has uploaded images of his tattoos.

The statement added: 'Both defendants were charged in a criminal complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois with one count of conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization.' 

In late 2014, Hasan came to the attention of the FBI. The investigation subsequently revealed that he and Jonas  had allegedly devised a plan for Hasan to wage violence on behalf of ISIL.

Hasan, a current member of the Illinois Army National Guard, planned to use his military training to fight.

As part of their plans, Hasan  booked an airline ticket to travel on Wednesday from Chicago and arrive in Cairo on Thursday, with layovers in Detroit and Amsterdam.

The pair (Hasan pictured left and Jonas right in a mugshot before beginning a prison sentence for conspiracy to commit armed robbery in 2005) were planning to wage 'war on behalf of ISIL'  the FBI complaint reads 

According to the criminal complaint, both defendants also planned for Jonas  to carry out an act of terrorism in the United States after Hasan had left.

The pair allegedly met with an FBI undercover employee and presented a plan to carry out an armed attack against a U.S. military facility in northern Illinois, an installation where Hasan  had been training.

The agent had reached out to Hasan and added him on Facebook.  

Jonas asked the FBI undercover employee to assist in the attack and explained that they would use Hasan's uniforms and the information he supplied about how to access the installation and target officers for attack.

According to the documents he saw a body count of between 100 and 150. Hasan said it would be closer to 120. 

The FBI complaint added that the pair said: 'Honestly we would love to do something like the brothers in Paris did' - referring to the attack on the headquarters of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. 

'Disturbingly, one of the defendants currently wears the same uniform of those they allegedly planned to attack,' said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin, in a statement.

He added: 'According to the charges filed today, the defendants allegedly conspired to provide material support to ISIL and planned to travel overseas to support the terrorist organization.

Hasan, 22, a U.S. citizen, was arrested on Wednesday at Chicago Midway International Airport after he checked onto a flight to Cairo, Egypt 

'In addition, they plotted to attack members of our military within the United States. Disturbingly, one of the defendants currently wears the same uniform of those they allegedly planned to attack. I want to thank the many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who are responsible for disrupting the threat posed by these defendants.'

'We will pursue and prosecute with vigor those who support ISIL and its agenda of ruthless violence,' said U.S. Attorney Fardon. 'Anyone who threatens to harm our citizens and allies, whether abroad or here at home, will face the full force of justice.'

'The arrests today are the culmination of a successful investigation that involved a great deal of coordination and communication with our law enforcement and military partners,' said Special Agent in Charge Holley. 

'Throughout the course of this investigation, the defendants were closely and carefully monitored to ensure the safety of the public and our service men and women.'

If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. 

Jonas already was convicted of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and served five years in a Georgia prison between 2005 and 2010.
