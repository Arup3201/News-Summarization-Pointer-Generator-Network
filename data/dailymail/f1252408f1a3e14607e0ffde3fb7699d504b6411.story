Gus Poyet tore into his hapless Sunderland side and claimed he has never been more embarrassed than after their 8-0 thrashing by Southampton.

Even then Poyet insisted he was holding back during his post-match press conference in the aftermath of their humiliating defeat.

'Where do I start?' he said. 'First, it was the most embarrassing moment I've had on a football pitch without any doubt. I feel sorry for the supporters. I thought we were creating something between the team and the supporters – they made a long trip and they deserved better.

'I use the word embarrassing because I'm trying to be respectful. This is not an easy press conference this one, I need to be very careful what I say. I'm responsible. It's going to be a difficult week.'

Poyet appeared to lay the blame on his players and did not feel it appropriate that he say sorry for their performance.

He made only one change to their starting XI from the victory against Stoke before the international break, replacing Billy Jones with Wes Brown.

He added: 'I don't like apologies because apologies look like you've done something bad. I did exactly the same thing as we did against Stoke, except with Billy Jones missing.

'We started well, everything was going all right, but the second half showed me a lot about individuals.

'I don't think I want to watch that again. Sometimes I make clips. I wouldn't have time to make as many clips as I need.

'Maybe the players will watch it. Maybe it will be good therapy for them to watch themselves.'

Poyet's opposite number Ronald Koeman was understandably delighted with his side's performance.

He said: 'I'm very pleased. Still a little bit in shock. That 8-0 is not a normal result. I was surprised after 20 minutes about the score - 2-0 up and we didn't start the game well. Sunderland were dominating and we had problems. Lucky by the first one, the own goal, gave us a little bit more confidence and we wake up after that.

'I'm very proud about the second half. We have 17 players out in the international break and if you show that ambition until the last second it is great.

'That was important. We played great football, we scored great goals and it was a great afternoon.'

The former Feyenoord boss also revealed he spoke to his opposite number after the game. He said: 'I know Poyet very well. At Spain we played a lot of times against each other, he at Zaragoza me at Barca. I said unlucky you didnt deserve this score. They played well at the beginning. I know the game is 90 minutes but then my feeling is to the other manager because losing 8-0 is a big result against your team. We spoke about that and the rest is private.'
