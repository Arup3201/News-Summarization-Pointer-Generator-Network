Gary Lineker has launched a scathing attack on Fifa following the governing body's decision to publish a report into claims of corruption during bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

'The way everything's run at Fifa, it's hugely depressing for those of us who love the game," Lineker told the BBC.

'I don't think there is any question that Fifa is at an all-time low.'

Gary Lineker has launched a scathing attack on Fifa following the World Cup bidding controversy 

American lawyer Michael Garcia conducted an investigation into the allegations of corruption for both tournaments which were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively.

Garcia resigned as Fifa's independent ethics investigator after his findings were released as a 42-page summary of the 430-page report.

Garcia labelled the the summary as 'erroneous' but Fifa have since backtracked and agreed to publish his original report in full but only after being assured there is no explosive detail within the 430 pages that would require another World Cup election.

The report into corruption by Michael Garcia will be published, the FIFA ExCo have decided

Lineker, however, insisted that the governing body was still massively corrupt despite their recent concession.

'The whole thing is a farce,' Lineker added. 'It's said football is the beautiful game, but it's hugely tarnished by what's going on.'

'It's come to the stage really where something needs to be done.

Sepp Blatter, the FIFA chairman, saw the day as a personal triumph that there will be no forced re-vote

'The only way something will really change is if the major federations around the world come together and say 'we have had enough of this'. But don't hold your breath.'

Fifa president Sepp Blatter has been a central figure during the recent controversies, but Lineker is adamant the head of football will successfully gain re-election for a fifth term in 2015.

'He's the man right at the top and in any other business or any other political form of life, that person would go and not be voted for.

'But you'll see, he will be voted in again as sure as Christmas is around the corner.'
