We've divided the Premier League into teams from the north and south of England - with Welsh side Swansea included in the south. 

Rob Draper had the choice to pick any players from the south teams, in any formation, with no limit on the number of players from each club. 

Here's how we split the clubs: 

 

South

Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Leicester City, QPR, Southampton, Swansea City, Spurs, West Brom, West Ham United

North

Burnley, Everton, Hull City, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Stoke City, Sunderland 

North vs South. It is perhaps the fiercest argument between the people of England.

But without dipping into the political allegiances, property prices and weather, we're sticking to the ultimate debating point – football.

This week we are starting a new North vs South debate - who would you pick and who would win?

In the NBA, each season they stage an All-Star match that pits the best from the West against the cream of the East.

And wouldn't it be fascinating if the Premier League adopted a similar event?

Kicking off today, Rob Draper selects his South XI - plus seven subs. A full explanation of the criteria is below.

Tomorrow, Joe Bernstein will reveal his North XI. Then on Wednesday, we'll reveal who would win the match thanks to our friends at Football Manager.

And, as always, we want you to tell us who you would have picked in your team...

Chelsea are top of the Premier League, and they provide the back-bone of our south XI to face the north

Goalkeeper: Thibaut Courtois (Chelsea) Not much to say – either him or David de Gea as goalkeeper of the season, so he’s a natural for the southern No 1 slot.

Right back: Nathaniel Clyne  (Southampton) You can wrestle this one back and forth with Branislav Ivanovic who has been superb. But I want a little more pace from my full backs and also am looking to the future by giving Clyne the nod.

Centre back: Jose Fonte (Southampton) Everyone thought Dejan Lovren was the mainstay of the Southampton defence – but quietly getting on with his job and holding together the best back four in the country has been Fonte.

Thibaut Courtois has proven himself to be a genuine Premier League star in his first season in England

Nathaniel Clyne (left) has earned himself an England spot, and keeps Branislav Ivanovic out of our side

Despite losing his centre back partner last summer, Jose Fonte has marshalled the best defence in the league

Centre back: John Terry (Captain) (Chelsea) Would be ridiculous not to pick him – the best defender in the Premier League at present.

Left back: Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea) Outstanding. Unfussy and consistently good. Best left back in the Premier League.

Defensive midfield: Nemanja Matic (Chelsea) For months he has been the pivotal player for Chelsea in providing balance – in the mould of Patrick Vieira and there is no higher praise.

Defensive midfield: Morgan Schneiderlin (Southampton) The steadying influence in Southampton’s rise, all the more remarkable given his disaffection at the start of the season.

John Terry - still the best defender in the Premier League - will captain our south XI, as he does Chelsea

Morgan Schneiderlin has bounced back from his uncertain summer to be a mainstay for Southampton

Nemanja Matic, Eden Hazard and Terry have been at the heart of Chelsea's table-topping form this season

Right wing: Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) Better on the left but nevertheless we need to find room for him in this team. The Sanchez-Cazorla-Hazard axis would terrify any team.

Attacking midfield: Santi Cazorla (Arsenal) Appears to be at the absolute peak of his career. Previously you wondered if he had the authority and character to dominate games - now, in his favoured central role, he is showing that.

Left wing: Eden Hazard (Chelsea) Potential player of the year. Impish, quick and delightfully skilful. A pleasure to watch – and a much more mature player now after two years in the Premier League.

Alexis Sanchez has been superb since signing for Arsenal, and is on the right wing for this side

Hazard's goals have helped take Chelsea top of the league, and he is a player of the season contender

Santi Cazorla has shown his best form since returning to a central role, and will operate behind the striker

Striker: Harry Kane (Tottenham) The easiest pick of all. The south is blessed with the best strikers, so much so that maybe we’ll go 4-4-2 later in the game to get Diego Costa or Olivier Giroud on. But there’s no doubt as to who is in best form at present.

Subs 

Rob Green (QPR) Petr Cech is probably the next best goalkeeper in the south; but we need a keeper who is sharp and playing regularly and Green has been superb.

Harry Kane has emerged this season as one of the Premier League's leading strikers, and is a must-pick

Branislav Ivanovic is unlucky to miss out on a starting spot, but stays on the bench for our south XI

Branislav Ivanovic (Chelsea) Very hard to leave him out. He has been a monster this season, rarely dipping below a 7/10 performance.

Laurent Koscielny (Arsenal) I’m a little worried that pace may be an issue for my centre halves – if it is we have Koscielny to cover. Excellent defender as well, despite Arsenal’s frequent debacles.

Fabien Delph (Aston Villa) No doubt he will be outraged at being in a southern team – but we had to draw the line somewhere. Just a really good, solid midfielder now.

Yannick Bolasie (Crystal Palace) Has come on enormously this season and the Africa Cup of Nations break doesn't appear to have affected him at all – causes problems to every team he plays against.

Olivier Giroud (Arsenal) Unfashionably good. His strike rate has been superb and his physicality and ability to hold the ball up is now perhaps the best in the Premier League, alongside...

(4-2-3-1): Courtois, Clyne,  Fonte, Terry, Azpilicueta; Matic, Schneiderlin; Sanchez, Cazorla, Hazard; Kane. 

Subs: Green, Ivanovic, Koscielny, Delph, Bolasie, Costa, Giroud

Diego Costa (Chelsea) The season has ebbed and flowed at times but through it all he has remained the striker you want to have on your side. Edged out by Kane at present but he’ll play a part in this game.

Honourable mentions to Gylfi Sigurdsson (Swansea) and Charlie Austin (QPR) who have both been excellent and who will be on the stand-by list.

Fabian Delph - though not particularly southern - has done enough this season to earn a spot on the bench

Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie has caused problems for every defender he has faced this season

Olivier Giroud, underrated but efficient, celebrates yet another Premier League goal for Arsenal
