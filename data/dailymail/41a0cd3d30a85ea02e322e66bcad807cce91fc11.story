Two young hoodlums who resorted to murder as part of a ruthless plan to build a drugs empire in the heart of the Middle England commuter belt were each jailed for life yesterday.

Charles Beadell and Ricky Jervis, both 22, begun a turf war to terrorise locals into joining their gang after they raked in around £30,000-a-month from peddling heroin and crack cocaine in the silk market town of Macclesfield in Cheshire.

But when former football coach Zain Sailsman, 19, double crossed the pair and sold a shotgun which had been used in a gangland shooting, Beadell and Jervis lured the teenager to woodlands and stabbed him in the back as a 'punishment'.

As the teenager staggered away dying from his wounds, Beadell who carried out the stabbing told Jervis: 'The kid thinks he can treat me like a muppet.'

Keep-fit fanatic Sailsman who was nicknamed 'Black Magic' climbed over a fence and tried to flee up a country lane but collapsed. Passing motorists tried to help him but he never regained consciousness. It emerged the knife cut into the spine and severed a major blood vessel leading to his heart.

Police investigating the murder later bugged a canal barge and secretly taped another local villain William Dale laughing about Beadell and the victim saying: 'Horrible little f***** that Charlie is. You know what I mean, cut his fingers off, cut his toes off, cut his ear off - anything but kill the guy.'

At Chester Crown Court, Beadell, from Macclesfield and Jervis, 22, from Congleton were both convicted of murder after a six-week trial and were each ordered to serve a minimum of 27 years.

Jervis tried to spit at police but missed and soiled the glass of the dock.

Beadell’s girlfriend Julia Howard, 36, a student forensic psychologist, who acted as the getaway driver was cleared of murder but convicted of perverting the course of justice and was jailed for three years.

Dale, 25, was jailed for 14 years after he admitted drugs and firearms offences.

Passing sentence the judge Mr Justice Robert Jay said: 'This case, as countless previous cases have done, highlights in cruel and graphic terms the grief, the misery, the human and social costs, of drug addiction and drug dealing.

'I have no doubt that the motive of both of you was to punish Zain Sailsman for what you felt was his cheeky attitude over time.

'You Beadell, knew that the gun had gone - you Jervis at the very least believed that it was highly likely that it had gone, and were of a mind to punish Zain Sailsman.'

The jury was told Macclesfield’s drugs rackets had been orchestrated by Dale from his barge which was moored between Congleton and Alsagar.

Dale was said to buy drugs in bulk and sell them on through a network of lower level dealers in towns across Cheshire and Staffordshire and would hire Beadell and Jervis.

But Beadell and Jervis wanted to take greater control of the Macclesfield drugs market after hoodlums from Manchester tried to move in on the area. Beadell himself was selling narcotics purely to make money for pure 'greed' and was turning over up to £1,000 a day on his own and would get his girlfriend to drive him around and was 'fuming' that outsiders were trying to grab his turf. 

He eventually recruited Sailsman a former youth team coach at non-league Macclesfield Town in Cheshire after exploiting the teenager’s drug habit.

Sailsman who wanted free access to crack cocaine began selling drugs for Beadell and was eventually used as a hired gun to terrorise a rival small-time dealer.

Last October Sailsman was driven to the home of their target where he used a 12 gauge shotgun to pump two bullets through the front door at point range - missing a couple and two children who were inside.

No one was injured but the rival who was not at home at the time was terrified enough to start working for Beadell.

The gun was later hidden in woodland with the ammunition hidden in a churchyard but Sailsman dug up the weapon and secretly sold it to pay for his own drug use before fleeing to Blackpool.

Beadell later contacted Sailsman’s mother Madeline Fletcher on Facebook saying people were coming to the house as her son had 'taken something' from him.

Mrs Fletcher, 48, told the jury that she and her three daughters had already been threatened by her son’s criminal associates with her car and house being vandalised.

The family home was turned into a ‘fortress’ with panic alarms and a fire- and bombproof letterbox.

She said: 'I had told Zain there was consequences to his actions. It was the way I tried to bring my kids up. They threatened they would petrol bomb the house. I was living in fear.'

Mrs Fletcher said she had been called by her son from Blackpool asking for money and added: 'He was crying, which wasn’t like him. He admitted carrying out the shooting with Charlie. I was shocked, especially as children were in the house. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t transfer money but said he would have to come back.

'I tried to make him see sense about the shooting. I couldn’t believe he could stoop so low. He said it was him who pulled the trigger. No one else had the bottle to do it. I told him to turn himself in.'

Jailed: Julia Howard, 36, a student forensic psychologist, who acted as the getaway driver was cleared of murder but convicted of perverting the course of justice and was jailed for three years; William Dale, 25, was jailed for 14 years after he admitted drugs and firearms offences

Sailsman was brought back to Macclesfield by relatives and he tried to keep a low profile but paid with his life when he agreed to meet Beadell on the pretext of recovering the shotgun and to continue working for him.

In a text exchange Sailsman asked Jervis: 'Not a set up or anything' and Jervis replied: 'What are you on? You’re one of the boys, I trust you.'

Beadell, Jervis and Sailsman were later driven to the woods by Howard on October 30.

Sailsman had planned to pretend to look for the gun by a tree then feign innocence when they could not find it - not knowing Beadell was armed with a 12-inch bladed knife.

Jervis told the court: 'Zain was digging around for a couple of minutes with his hands. He looks a bit confused, gets up, looking and Charlie gets down and starts looking.

'How do you lose a shotgun? You don’t lose a shotgun. Someone said we should go back in the morning and look for it. Zain swore on his mother’s life that hadn’t been there or moved the gun but Charlie started raising his voice saying: "You’re saying it’s me who took it".

Ricky Jervis was jailed for 27 years for murder

'They carried on arguing and then Charlie lunged at Zain and came away screaming and shouting. Zain’s turned away from him and I saw the knife. He was moving the trees out the way. Charlie had the knife in his right hand. Zain ran towards the fence 'I said stop, man, stop! Zain said, "What the f***? What’s he done that for?" I didn’t realise how badly hurt he was.

'I said to Charlie "What the f***, he’s supposed to be your guy, you just stabbed him." I was shocked.’

Beadell and Howard fled Macclesfield and checked into various hotels but were arrested two days later. Jervis was arrested as he was fleeing into the countryside carrying a bag containing his clothes stained in the victim’s blood.

All three denied murder. Beadell claimed Sailsman was stabbed by two drug dealers from Liverpool. 

In a statement after the case, Sailsman’s family said: 'Zain’s life has been cruelly and tragically cut short and regardless of the sentence imposed his murderers will one day walk free and be able to resume their lives. Zain will never get that opportunity. In our eyes no sentence will ever be long enough.

'Zain’s death has ripped the heart out of our family and our lives will never be the same without him in them. Zain was no angel in life but to us he was always the little boy with the cheeky smile and the big sense of humour. He did not deserve to die the way in which he did.'
