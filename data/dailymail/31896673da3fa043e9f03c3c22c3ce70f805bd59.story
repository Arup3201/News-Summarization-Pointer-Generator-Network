The cartoon Uncle Sam helped inspire American men to enlist in World War I, but the national figure is actually based on a real man who lived more than 200 years ago and briefly fought in the Revolutionary War.

Sam Wilson was born in Arlington, Massachusetts on September 13, 1766 and went on to become a wealthy meat-packer and business owned in Troy, New York.

It was his government contract supplying provisions to U.S. troops during the War of 1812 that Uncle Sam first inspired the larger-than-life caricature.

But Wilson's service to the U.S. started in 1781, when he enlisted in the Revolutionary Army at the age of 15.

By the time he joined, the war was near a close and young Wilson was deemed too weak to fight on the battlefield.

So he spent his six months with the army guarding cattle, mending fences and helping to slaughter and package meat.

He took that skill with him when he moved to Troy, New York with his brother several years later.

The Wilson brothers were one of the first pioneer families in the community and established several local businesses there, including a brick-making company.

Eventually Wilson bought a parcel of land to start a meat-packing business, and when the War of 1812 broke out, he secured an important contract to feed the soldiers in New York and New Jersey for a year.

The 6,000 barrels of pork and beef that E&S Wilson slaughterhouse shipped to the soldiers in Greenbush, New York were stamped with the label 'E&S - U.S.'.

Most of the soldiers stationed in the area were from Troy and familiar with Sam Wilson, who was given the nickname Uncle Sam in the community.

So the soldiers associated the U.S. stamp with meaning both Uncle Sam and United States. Soon all provisions, whether they came from E&S Wilson or not, were referred to as Uncle Sam's.

After the war, an author writing under a pseudonym published 'The Adventures of Uncle Sam: In Search After His Lost Honor' - one of the first references to Uncle Sam as the national personification.

In the book, Uncle Sam was referred to as a meat packer, which lines up with the real Sam Wilson's background.

But it wasn't until 1860 that Uncle Sam started to resemble the character we know today.

It was artist Thomas Nash who illustrated Uncle Sam as a tall, goateed, thin man wearing a pin-striped suit and star-spangled top hat. In real life, Sam Wilson was actually clean shaven.

James Montgomery Flagg used Nash's character as the basis for the most famous iteration of Uncle Sam.

In 1917, Flagg created the famous 'I Want You for U.S. Army' propaganda poster which went on to sell more than 4million copies after appearing on the cover of Leslie's Weekly.
