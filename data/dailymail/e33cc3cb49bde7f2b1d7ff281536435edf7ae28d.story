Thom Browne, a designer who attracted worldwide acclaim last January when Michelle Obama wore his custom design to her husband’s second inauguration, staged his semiannual womenswear fashion show early Monday evening.

Mr Browne, a long-time favorite within the fashion industry as well as the Asian commercial market, stunned audiences with his dream-like take on what was ‘loosely based off of Elizabethan clowns’ he told MailOnline before his show began.

The procession, fabricated nearly entirely in white fabric (sometimes supplemented with hints of navy), was a study in both dramatic referencing and textural interest.

‘It was a challenge to do it [in all white]’ Mr Browne told us backstage. ‘Especially to have forty looks that had very different textures within them.’

He staged the show in an equally 
white-washed room, built to resemble a mental institution, with padded 
and tiled walls. A small handful of models dressed in Mr Browne’s take 
on nurses’ uniforms emerged first, each administering small plastic cups
of white M&M’s (presumably in place of Lithium) to amused audience 
members.

Then came the hospital’s patients, dressed in an array of boned nipped-waist looks, armed with high-neck collars, confused (or sometimes narcissistic) stares, and the kind of intricate detailing that would rival collections from any of Europe’s great fashion houses.

Many of the silhouettes on display were similar to the ones utilized by Mr Browne in his last few womenswear collections—which makes sense, as he’s a classicist at heart. ‘I never pay attention to any kinds of trends or anything,’ he told us. ‘I just think that preppy Americana feels good and that it’s kind of timeless and it’s what I like.’

Much like his flair for showmanship, 
Mr Browne has never been one to shy away from a strong preppy hand. 
Showering his army of lacy clowns in small anchors, pearls, and penny 
loafer heels was the least of his challenges this season. ‘I just do it’
he said of his process for layering references.

In
sending his models to a metal facility, Mr Browne explored the more 
pervasive qualities of his own work. His clothes have a consistently 
disturbing quality to them, often aided by extreme hair and make-up 
techniques. But by dressing up his models in smeared red lipstick, 
chokingly-tight latex collars, and woven wicker petticoats, Mr Browne 
aired his fashion disturbances with an even stronger edge.

‘I
do my shows and the more conceptual part of what I do to make the 
commercial side more interesting,’ he told us. ‘And even as conceptual 
as they are, they are seriously made as really classic pieces of 
clothes.’

That much may be true—sheath dresses, 
tailored blazers, and closely-shorn pencil skirts all lay at the root of
Mr Browne’s sartorial intellect for spring.

Their fabrications however, added to the 
collection’s otherworldly sense. Fortuny-like pleated chiffons, cobwebby
laces, and 3-D tweeds took Mr Browne’s designs to another dimension. As
did a honeycomb-like material that likely pleased many of the 
audience’s many Japanese members, many of which came dressed in 
head-to-toe Thom Browne looks (the fabric strongly resembled the foam 
material traditionally used to wrap and protect Japanese peaches).

But most importantly (at least for Mr Browne’s sake) is how his show’s enormous audience proved that his womenswear label is gaining serious ground in both the commercial and critical realms. In the last few seasons, it’s seemed to at least double in size.

‘Michelle Obama definitely helped,’ Mr Browne told us of his womenswear’s escalating success. ‘It feels good, I am very serious about making good clothes for women, so I like to see that they appreciate it.’
