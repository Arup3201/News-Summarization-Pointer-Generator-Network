A heart-wrenching tape of a boy telling police how his mother 'did nothing' when his father stabbed his autistic brother to death has been played in court.

The seven-year-old revealed in graphic detail how William De Jesus, a 41-year-old 
who had a history of mental illness, launched a frenzied knife 
attack on his wife and two young sons on February 9.

It happened during a hostage stand-off with police after De Jesus had shot and killed a 
76-year-old man at a trailer park in Deerfield Beach, Florida.

The boy's autistic old brother Josiah, nine, was killed by De Jesus as his mother, Deanna Beauchamp De Jesus, allegedly stood by and watched.

She is on trial in Broward, Fort Lauderdale, accused of aggravated manslaughter and child neglect for not stopping her husband kill Jonah.

In a tape played to the court, the boy said of his mother: 'She wanted to die to go up to heaven. She didn't want all these problems.'

The boy was heard calmly recalling for Broward sheriff's detectives details of the killings he had just witnessed, the Sun Sentinel reported.

He
said his mother made no effort to stop his father from brutally 
stabbing his older brother to death even though his mother was in their 
presence.

'She did 
nothing,' the boy said. A sheriff's detective later asked, 'When you 
guys were getting stabbed, did she yell or say anything to your dad?'

'No,' he replied.

De Jesus was appearing for the second day of testimony in her trial. De Jesus has cried repeatedly during two days of court as she heard detailed testimony of the killings and saw photos of the bodies of Josiah and her husband.

De Jesus' crying at one point led Judge Jeffrey Levenson to briefly halt the trial.

Among the items of evidence displayed were was photo
of Josiah's bloodied body on a mattress inside a motor home after he 
had been stabbed multiple times by his father.

The name of the younger son is being withheld at the request of the state Department of Children & Families, which has placed him in foster care.

Prosecutors claim De Jesus had an obligation as a parent to safeguard her children.

They blame her for failing to act as a protector and failing to stop her husband from stabbing Josiah to death and trying to kill their other son at Highland Woods RV Park in Deerfield Beach.

Moons blames the killings on his client's husband, saying his rampage was uncontrollable and that nobody could have foreseen what happened.

Moons has said his client suffered wounds, including a punctured lung, that limited her ability to protect her children.

As authorities investigated the attack, they considered the mother as less of a victim and more of a criminally responsible participant.

At the time of his death, Josiah still required diapers and didn't speak, prosecutors said. The other son managed to survive by fighting back in a way his older brother could not, they said.

The younger son's interview was recorded with the Broward Sheriff's Office on February 10 at Broward Health Medical Center, the Sun Sentinel reported.

Detectives waited around a half-hour to speak to him, because doctors were treating the boy's stab wounds and gauging whether he required surgery.

The boy told detectives the day had begun in a normal way: He and his family were at their Port Orange home when their father insisted on driving them all to South Florida, where William De Jesus' cousin lives.

The boy recalled making several stops in South Florida before he and his family randomly wound up at the Highland Woods RV park.

They visited his father's cousin, who ran an errand to buy diapers for Josiah. The family also went to a McDonald's restaurant and checked in at a motel before his father erratically forced his family back on the road.

'He was crazy. I think he was crazy,' the boy said. He said he recalled his father saying that he thought they all would be killed on the road.

At the RV park, the boy said, he took his father's knife after his father had stabbed him. The boy said he tried to discard it, but his father seized the knife again.

'I said, 'No more,' ' the boy said in the recording. 'I had the knife and I wanted to throw it away out the window. Then he grabbed it again, and he stabbed me like three times again. Then he fell on the floor.'

Jurors also heard two recorded interviews that Deanna De Jesus had with authorities. She described herself feeling helpless and unable to intervene the night her husband went on his rampage.

'He stabbed me in my lungs, and I wasn't able to do anything,' De Jesus told an officer March 2, the day she was taken into custody in Central Florida on criminal charges.

When Levenson asked Moons at the end of Thursday's hearing whether De Jesus planned to take the stand in her defence, Moons replied it still was too early to say.

Moons said he planned to ask the judge this afternoon to dismiss the case. If the case isn't dismissed, the jury is expected to hear closing arguments on Monday.
