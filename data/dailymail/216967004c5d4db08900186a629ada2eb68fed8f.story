Your next secretary could be one of the most famous Jeopardy! champs of all time because the supercomputer that beat Ken Jennings just moved a step closer to becoming available to businesses everywhere.

IBM announced Thursday it's investing over $1 billion to give its Watson supercomputer a business division in New York City dedicated to offering the ‘human-like’ technology to hospitals, banks and other groups through the cloud.

That means Watson’s unmatched data-crunching prowess may soon be employed as a secretary, a customer service representative, or countless other jobs that will require it to engage one-on-one with human beings.

'I'm afraid I can't do that, Ken': Watson, the IBM supercomputer that beat Jeopardy champ Ken Jennings will get its own $1 billion business division housed in New York City's East Village

Armonk, New York-based IBM said the new business unit will be dedicated to the development and commercialization of the project that first gained fame by defeating a pair of ‘Jeopardy!’ champions, including 74-time winner Jennings, in 2011.

In the years since Watson's TV appearance, IBM has been developing the supercomputer for more practical purposes and changed it to a cloud-based service. 

Its massive computing capabilities once took a device the size of a room, but Watson is now that size of three stacked pizza boxes, according to BetaNews.

IBM says Watson is unique because it it's programed like traditional computers and uses artificial intelligence to learn from its past experiences and factor that information into its future operations.

Human-like: IBM says the supercomputer thinks like a human and will put its unprecedented data-crunching capabilities to use in the cloud for use by banks, healthcare companies and other businesses and will even engage with customers

‘IBM has transformed Watson from a quiz-show winner, into a commercial cognitive computing breakthrough that is helping businesses engage customers, healthcare organizations personalize patient care, and entrepreneurs build businesses,’ said Michael Rhodin, who will head the new Watson Group.

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty said that Watson is built for a world where big data is transforming every industry and every profession.

‘Watson does more than find the needle in the haystack,’ Rometty said in remarks released ahead of the company's Thursday presentation. ‘It understands the haystack. It understands context.’

As part of its investment, IBM is building a new headquarters for the business on the edge of New York City's East Village near New York University and other technology companies. About $100 million will go toward investing in startup companies that are building apps to be run through Watson.

Artificial intelligence: After starting with a team of just 27, the business will employ 2,000 people. IBM says $100 million of the initial billion will go toward funding startup tech companies that will run through Watson

Eventually the business, which started out as a team of 27 people, will employ about 2,000, including several hundred at the new headquarters, IBM said.

Rhodin, a long-time IBM, said the move marks the start of a new era for IBM and the new headquarters is meant to be a departure from the project's current research facility's sleepier surroundings about 40 miles north of the city in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.

The angular glass building also will stand out from the rest of its neighborhood, which is home to some of the oldest buildings in the city.

‘The millennial generation gets this, they understand that this is,’ Rhodin said in an interview ahead of the announcement. ‘This is a departure. It's a statement on our part.’

The will have marketing and sales capabilities, while also hosting engineering and development work and collaborations with customers and startup companies looking to utilize Watson's capabilities.
