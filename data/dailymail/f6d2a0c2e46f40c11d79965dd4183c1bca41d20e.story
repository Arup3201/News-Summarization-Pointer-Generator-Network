A professional footballer's brother hanged himself  after suspecting his girlfriend had been cheating on him, an inquest heard.

Byron Moore discovered the  body of his heartbroken older brother Louis Moore, 28, on the day he signed for Port Vale FC on July 3.

An inquest heard their mother received a text message from Louis saying 'I want to be alone, it's over' as Byron put pen to paper with the League One club.

After rushing back from Vale Park stadium to Louis' house in Meir Hay, Staffordshire, the 26-year-old footballer discovered his brother's body.

Emergency services were called to the scene at around 3pm but nothing could be done to save Louis, himself a promising athlete, who represented Great Britain as a teen.

North Staffordshire Coroners Court heard Byron had also received disturbing messages from his brother earlier in the day.

Giving evidence, Byron - who joined Port Vale from Crew Alexandra - said the texts suggested Louis' ex had been seeing another man before they split up.

He told the inquest: 'My brother and I were really close and we would text each other most days.

'I didn't know about problems with his relationship though because he kept that stuff to himself.

'I normally spoke to him about football and things like that.

'I hadn't seen her since Christmas because she was living and working in London.

'I only knew about what happened after I had a text message from him on the day I was signing for Port Vale telling me they had split up.

'He said she had been seeing another man. It was a bit of shock. It just seemed to come of the blue.

'Later on, I had a call from my mum.

'She said she had got a text from Louis and was concerned about him.'

Coroner Ian Smith concluded that Louis had taken his own life and said the revelation his former partner might have cheated on him could have been a trigger for his suicide.

He said: 'Louis found a mobile device belonging to her [his ex-girlfriend] suggesting she had a relationship with someone else.

'He found out on the day and it may be that was a trigger for him to do what he did.

'Clearly he was deeply upset by losing his long-term girlfriend and then even more upset and angry at finding messages on the phone and that has tipped him over the edge.'

Louis's former partner said in a statement that her ex had told her he had called the Samaritans because he was struggling to cope after they split up.

The inquest heard Byron and his mother Jannice Mountford, 50, called at Louis's home and found the front door unlocked. Inside they found Louis's body and a note.

She told the hearing: 'On the day before he died, I was due to go down to his house but he told me not to come because they were talking.

'I thought I would leave him to it and told him I would come down the next day.

'The next day, I had just about finished work when he texted me at 3.23pm saying he wanted to be on his own and that she had been with someone else and the relationship was over.

'That was the first indication I had the relationship was over.'

Louis had once been a part of the under-13s Great Britain team whose 1997 record for the 4x100m relay race at Northwood Stadium, Staffordshire, remains unbeaten.

He also excelled in long jump, high jump and pentathlon and was coached by Jim Talbot, who worked with double Olympic gold medallist Daley Thompson.

After graduating from Staffordshire University with a degree in sports science he had aspirations to join the police and volunteered with Staffordshire's Special Constabulary for a year before work commitments meant he had to stop.

At the time of the tragedy, Byron, who scored in the 2012 League Two play-off final for Crewe Alexandra at Wembley, said he would dedicate every goal he scores in future to his brother.
