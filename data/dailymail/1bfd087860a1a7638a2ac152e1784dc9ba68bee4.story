President Barack Obama fired a double-barreled volley at Republicans on Wednesday, saying that the GOP is 'hating' him by pursuing a federal lawsuit over changes to the Obamacare health insurance law.

The lawsuit received a go-ahead hours later by a 225-201 vote, passing the House of Representatives along largely party lines with five Republicans voting 'no.' Every Democrat opposed the legislation authorizing the lawsuit.

'There’s a bunch of stuff that needs to get done,' Obama told a cheering, partisan audience in Kansas City, Missouri just hours earlier. 'Unfortunately, I think the main vote ... that they’ve scheduled for today is whether or not they decide to sue me for doing my job.'

'And, by the way,' he added, 'I’ve told them – I said, I’d be happy to do it 
with you. So the only reason I’m doing it on my own is because you 
don’t do anything.'

In an off-the-cuff speech filled with rabble-rousing language, Obama blamed Republicans in the House of Representatives for blocking his agenda on make-work infrastructure jobs, illegal immigration and a minimum wage hike. But he reserved his biggest applause lines for an attack on the idea of facing a federal judge over questions of executive overreach.

'Stop just hating': Obama singled out congressional Republicans for scorn on Wednesday in Kansas City, mocking efforts to sue him for overextending his authority with changes to the Obamacare law

'Some of the things we’re doing without Congress are making a difference, but we could do so much more if Congress would just come on and help out a little bit,' he said to applause.

'Just come on. Come on and help out a little bit. Stop being mad all the time. Stop just hating all the time. Come on. Let’s get some work done together.'

The lawsuit that faces the Obama administration is focused on unilateral changes the White House made to the Affordable Care Act, a sweeping health insurance overhaul passed by Democrats without any Republican votes.

On July 11 House Speaker John Boehner announced that his lawsuit would go ahead.

Obama, he said, 'changed the health care law without a vote of Congress' in 2013, 'effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it.'

The president, he carped, 'believes he has the power to make his own laws.'The Obama administration has taken several actions that Republicans say twisted the plain meaning of the Obamacare law's black-letter text, ignoring dates that the law set in stone – for both practical and political reasons.'

The administration has twice pushed back the law's requirement that large employers provide health insurance to their workers, even though the law reads that it 'shall apply to months beginning after December 31, 2013.'

Companies with between 50 and 99 employees now can flout the law until 2016 without paying tax penalties. Larger employers have until 2015.

In a twist of irony, Republicans themselves sought similar delays in 2013 when America's two major political parties came to loggerheads during a budget battle, forcing a temporary, partial government shutdown.

Obama's changes, however, came without consulting Congress: By the time the Treasury Department put them in place, the House was in Republican hands and no longer in the mood to tinker with America's gargantuan medical insurance market.

On Wednesday, the president was in full combat mode again.

House Rules Committee chairman Rep. Pete Sessions carried the ball for Republicans on Wednesday in a hearing to finalize the terms of a lawsuit against the Obama administration

'Look, we’ve got just today and tomorrow until Congress leaves town for a month,' he said, 'and we’ve still got some serious work to do.'

'I mean, everybody recognizes this is a political stunt,' he said of the lawsuit, 'but it’s worse than that, because every vote they’re taking like that means a vote they’re not taking to actually help you. ... And, by the way, you know who is paying for this suit they’re going to file?  You.'

Speaker of the House John Boehner has insisted that his lawsuit won't be a prelude to impeachment, but only an action to force the president to uphold his duties under the Constitution

Obama also claimed that if Boehner's legal action were to go to trial, 'I would have already left office' by the time it was resolved. 'So it’s not a productive thing to do.'

On Monday Boehner penned an op-ed in USA Today, arguing that suing the president is 'not about me vs. President Obama. This is about future Congresses and future presidents.'

'There is a conflict between the executive branch and the legislative branch of our government. It is the judiciary branch’s role to help resolve it. I believe this path is the right one to defend our institution and preserve the Constitution.'

On July 24 the House Rules Committee green-lighted suing the president in a preliminary vote that fell along partisan lines.

As the committee met Wednesday to finalize the language and move for a debaet on the House floor, warring sides heard from constitutional lawyers and picked fights with each other over whether Obama has abused his power.

'This is not a political issue. This is not an issue that should pit Republicans against Democrats,' said Texas Republican Rep. Pete Sessions, who chairs the committee.

'Any person interested in our Constitution and our brilliant system of separation of powers should be worried about what is currently happening in our country.'

Florida Democrat Alcee Hastings disagreed, calling the lawsuit 'frivolous on steroids. It's absolutely insane what you all are doing.'

'This is a partisan political stunt timed to peak in the House of Representatives in November, right as the midterm elections are happening,' added New York Democratic Rep. Louisie Slaughter.

'The House majority is suing the president simply for doing his job.'

Hastings was a federal judge until 1989, when he was impeached and removed from office, one of only eight federal officials in U.S. history to wear that professional stain.

In that case, both houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats. His impeachment was carried out on charges of bribery and perjury. The House of Representatives, to which he now belongs, condemned him by a vote of 413-3.

Hypocrite: New York Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter opposed the lawsuit on Wednesday but once joined in a similar legal action against President George W. Bush

Florida Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings slammed the planned lawsuit as a partisan witch-hunt formulated for political advantage in November's midterm elections; he has been on the receiving end of ethics proceedings before, as the only member of Congress to have been impeached and removed from the bench as a federal judge

Slaughter joined in a 2006 lawsuit against President George W. Bush over that year's federal budget bill.

George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told the Rules Committee that 'it is not a political question when this body goes to court and says the president has exceeded his authority.'

If Congress fails to hold the White House to its constitutional responsibilities, he said, 'I think this system is going to change in a very significant and in my view a dangerous way.'

Attorney Walter Dellinger, a former Clinton administration official, said in his testimony that asking a federal judge to settle disputes when the president doesn't administer a law the way the House wants 'would be an unprecedented aggrandizement of the political power of the judiciary.'

'Such a radical liberalization of the role of unelected judges in matters previously entrusted to the elected branches of government should be rejected,' he said.

The U.S. Constitution requires the president to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'

Florida International University law professor Elizabeth Price Foley told the panel on Wednesday that Republicans have 'an excellent chance' of winning a lawsuit if it focuses on the meaning of that line in America's founding document.

In a sparsely attended press conference following the vote to sue the president, House minority Leader Nancy Pelosi blamed Republicans for frittering away money on a lawsuit that 'should not be a priority.'

'We don't have money to have early childhood education for children, they have rejected the president's universal pre-K, but they do have money to sue the president,' Pelosi said.

'How much money is that? Nobody knows.'

She also insisted the Congress 'lacks standing' to sue.

'They certainly do not have standing to sue the President of the United States.'

'This is about the road to impeachment,' she claimed, although Boehner said this week that impeachment is off the table.

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer accused Republicans of wasting time and Americans' money in search of 'partisan political confrontations.'

'This lawsuit will go nowhere,' he predicted.
