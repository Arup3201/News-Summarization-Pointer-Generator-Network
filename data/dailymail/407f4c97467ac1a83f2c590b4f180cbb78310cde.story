Darron Gibson is out of the Republic of Ireland's Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland on Sunday.

The Everton midfielder has been unable to train since joining up with the squad in Malahide because of a groin problem, and was withdrawn on Wednesday afternoon.

A Football Association of Ireland spokesman said: 'The Football Association of Ireland today confirmed that Darron Gibson has withdrawn from the Republic of Ireland squad to face Poland on March 29 due a persistent groin injury.

'Darron will return to his club today for treatment.'

Gibson was one of three players unable to train with the rest of the party at the Aviva Stadium on Wednesday, with James McClean and Stephen Ward battling ankle problems.

Martin O'Neill's side host Poland at the Aviva Stadium on Sunday, kick-off 7.45pm.
