Fraud: The late Shinichi Suzuki, founder of the Suzuki method, has been lying about his training

A legendary music teacher behind a world-renowned method has been accused of being a fraud and lying about befriending Albert Einstein.

Shinichi Suzuki, founder of the Suzuki method which has been used by millions, claimed he spent eight years studying in Germany and cited Einstein as his 'guardian'.

It has now emerged that the Japanese musician was rejected from the prestigious Berlin music school at auditions, and only met Einstein once to sell him a violin.

The Suzuki method has taught millions of children since it was launched by the Japanese violinist in the late 1950s.

It sees children start playing an instrument as young as possible, preferably around the age of three, and learn by playing the same short pieces repeatedly from memory.

To back up his credibility as a teacher Suzuki, who died in 1998 at the age of 99, claimed he spent eight years as a private student of Karl Klinger, a leading violinist and professor at Berlin Hochshule, in the 1920s, during which time he says he befriended Einstein.

However a number of critics are now presenting evidence that Suzuki lied about his training and background, accusing him of being a fraud. 

The most recent includes proof that Suzuki, the son of a violin maker, was rejected by Klinger and the Berlin Hochshule when he auditioned there in 1923, aged 24. 

'I think it is one of the biggest frauds in music history,' Mark O'Connor, a U.S. violin teacher and composer told The Telegraph.

'I don't believe anybody has properly checked his past.' 

Mr O'Connor has posted the list of auditions from the German music school on his blog, which includes Suzuki's and proves that he failed to get in and was never taught by Klinger.

'Shinichi Suzuki had no violin training from any serious violin teacher that we can find,' O'Connor writes on his blog.

Fake credentials: Shinichi Suzuki,  pictured teaching Jimmy Carter's daughter Amy to play during a visit to the White House in 1979, never studied in Berlin and no evidence can be found that he had any training at all

'He was basically self-taught, beginning the violin at the age of 18, and it showed. He was never allowed a position in any orchestra, never performed professionally or made a professional recording.'

In Suzuki's biographies it is claimed that he was Klinger's 'only private pupil' from 1921, two years before he auditioned for the school.

Mr O'Connor, himself the founder of a teaching method, claims Suzuki lied to be able to sell his training method around the globe.

'Looking at this single line entry of Shinichi Suzuki - we have a 24 year-old man who was not good enough to get lessons at this music conservatory with any professor there including Karl Klingler, and therefore did not seek violin training at the end of the day.'

Although Suzuki himself once claimed he befriended Albert Einstein, a keen amateur violin player, and was under his 'guardianship' while in Berlin, there is no evidence of this, Mr O'Connor says, other than that Suzuki once delivered one of his father's violins to him.

Following publication of this article, we were contacted by the International Suzuki Association and the British Suzuki Institute, who supplied the following statement prepared by the International Suzuki Association Board of Directors:

Shinichi Suzuki had violin lessons with the prominent German violinist Karl Klingler in Berlin in the 1920’s. Klingler’s daughter, Marianne Klingler, was a strong supporter of Suzuki’s teaching principles and became the first chairperson of the European Suzuki Association. Ms. Klingler confirmed many times that Suzuki had indeed studied with her father.

Many honorary doctorates and awards were bestowed upon Shinichi Suzuki during his lifetime. Some of these include: Honorary Doctor of Music, New England Conservatory of Music (1966), Honorary Doctor of Music, University of Louisville (1967), Ysaye Award from Eugene Ysaye Foundatiion (1969), Order of the Rising Sun, Third Class (circa 1970), Honorary Doctor of Music, University of Rochester Eastman School of Music (1972), 6th Moil Music Award from Japan (1976), Honorary Distinguished Professor, North East Louisiana University (1982), PALMES ACADEIQUES from France (1982), Japan Foundation Award (1983), Honorary Doctor of Music, Oberlin College Conservatory of Music (1984), Bundesverdienstkreuz 1.Klasse from West Germany (1985), Venezia Award from Italy's Venezia Award Society (1985), Honorary Doctor of Music, Cleveland Institute of Music (1990), Honorary Doctor of Music, University of St. Andrews, Scotland (1990).

Throughout his professional life, Shinichi Suzuki was open to new ideas and development in teaching aimed at improving the learning environment for children studying how to play a musical instrument. He strongly encouraged teachers to develop new ideas and share their ideas with one another. This continues to be central to Suzuki teaching throughout the world, implemented by the many teachers who today apply Suzuki’s teaching principles.

In the end, however, it is not what Shinichi Suzuki did or did not do in the 1920s that is of importance. The important issue is the successful use of his teaching principles which have enriched the lives of students and has positively influenced music education worldwide for the past 70 years.
