Family and friends of the Indiana aid worker beheaded by ISIS extremists were joined by politicians and prominent figures in the Muslim community at a memorial service Sunday.

Abdul-Rahman Kassig, the former Army Ranger who was 26 at the time of his death, was remembered for his commitment to aid work at Butler University two days after his funeral services. 

'We're not here because of how he passed,' said Hazem Bata, executive director Islamic Society of North America in Plainfield.

'We're because of how he lived. We're here because of the type of man he chose to be. We're here because of his selflessness.'

Kassig landed in the hands of ISIS extremists last year while delivering aid to Syrians caught in the crossfire of a ghastly civil war.

At the time he was working as part of Special Emergency Response and Assistance, or SERA, a relief organization he founded in 2012 and which suspended operations after his kidnapping.

His parents learned of his capture last year, though the information was not made public at the time.

When Kassig appeared in a beheading video of a British aid worker, his parents recorded a video pleading for his release to ISIS militants.

Kassig, who converted to Islam and changed his name from Peter during his time in captivity, inspired the Muslim community to come to his family's side.

The Indianapolis Star reports that at a funeral service Friday, Muslim leaders denounced ISIS violence, citing the Quran's prohibition of Muslims killing other Muslims.

'The question is, is this Islam? Definitely not. Does this group belong to Islam? No, it does not. Islam is a religion of love, mercy and peace,' said Syrian Imam Shaykh Muhammad Al-Yaqoubi.

'Encouraging killing is not Islamic,' added Imam Al-Yaqoubi.

At Clowes Hall at Butler on Sunday, public figures who hadn't known Kassig got up to speak about his legacy. 

'It's the spirit of believing things can get better. That together we can make a difference,' said Indiana senator Joe Donnelly about Kassig's commitment to humanitarian work.

'He was an extraordinary in every way.'
