A millionaire former Tory donor defected to UKIP today and announced he was handing the party £1million to fight the next election - because he was angry at being called a 'nobody' by William Hague.

Arron Banks, who has previously given tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservatives, said he was only going to give Nigel Farage's party £100,000 - but decided to increase it by £900,000 after Mr Hague's jibe.

The announcement, timed to disrupt David Cameron's set-piece party conference speech this morning, comes after the Tories were left stunned by the double defection of rebel backbenchers Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless.

But David Cameron today warned voters who back UKIP at the next election that they risk 'going to bed with Nigel Farage and waking up with Ed Miliband'.

Potshot: Commons leader William Hague dismissed Mr Banks (pictured) as someone he'd 'never heard of'

Speaking this morning, Mr Hague - the Commons leader - dismissed the importance of Mr Banks' defection.

He said: 'I’ve never heard of him so we are not going to get too upset about that. It’s certainly not going to overshadow the prime minister’s speech today that someone we haven’t heard of has gone to Ukip.'

The remarks infuriated Mr Banks, causing him to increase his planned donation to UKIP.

Speaking to reporters this evening he said: 'In light of that and in view of the fact that I am a strong advocate of leaving the EU, I've decided to donate £1million to the party and not the £100,000 originally agreed.' He added: 'Mr Hague will now know who I am.'

Mr Farage said the donation had capped a 'remarkable week' for UKIP following Mr Reckless's defection on Saturday.

He also lashed out at the personal attacks directed against UKIP during the Tory party conference in Birmingham.

The UKIP leader attacked Boris Johnson's claim that UKIP defectors were the type of people of had sex with vacuum cleaners. Mr Farage said it was an 'incredibly crude' jibe.

Recent Tory defections to UKIP have sparked an angry torrent of abuse against Mr Farage's party at the Conservative conference in Birmingham this week.

Boris Johnson accused defectors of being the kind of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners - while former Chancellor Ken Clarke said the party's supporters were 'grumpy old men' who had led 'disappointing lives'.

In his conference speech today, Mr Cameron warned backing UKIP would only help Labour to victory.

He said: 'If you vote UKIP – that's really a vote for Labour. Here's a thought - on 7th May you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband.'

The Prime Minister quipped: 'I don't know about you but not one bit of that works for me.' 

Mr Banks – an insurance supremo – will hand over a cheque to Mr Farage for £100,000 today in a major boost to UKIP.

Mr Banks told Sky News he did not believe the Prime Minister would succeed in his efforts to reform the European Union or leave it.

He said: ‘I’ve supported the Conservatives for a number of years but have come to the realisation that only Ukip supports my views.

‘Being a member of the EU is like having a first class ticket on the Titanic. Economically, remaining in the EU is unsustainable.’

The move is the latest in a series of announcements designed to disrupt the Tories’ final party conference before the general election.

Over the weekend Mr Reckless became the second Tory MP to jump ship and trigger and a Commons by-election rather than sit as a UKIP MP.

Former deputy mayor of London Richard Barnes has also declared he is switching allegiance.

Mr Banks said: ‘We are being dragged down to the lowest common denominator of financial growth when we should be looking to trade worldwide and should be basing our future prosperity on a long-term global outlook.

‘The Conservative Party try to sell us the myth that EU reform is achievable when frankly all Cameron can offer is tinkering around the edges. He is not even able to bring himself to say that he would support UK exit if his supposed reforms do not work.’

Labour frontbencher Michael Dugher said: ‘David Cameron is haemorrhaging support and his authority is ebbing away. He can’t control his party, who clearly have no confidence in his leadership.

‘And once again we see that Ukip are reliant on Tory money as well as Tory policy and Tory politicians, putting paid to the idea that they stand up for working people.’
