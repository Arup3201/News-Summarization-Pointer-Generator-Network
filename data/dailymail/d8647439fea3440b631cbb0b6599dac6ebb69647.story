People try all sorts of tricks to attract the perfect partner.

But experts have proved that women have one weapon of seduction in their arsenal that men do not – the power to make their voices sexier.

Women lower the pitch of their voice and increase their hoarseness to sound more attractive, whereas men who tried to sound sexy failed and in some cases sounded less attractive, a study found.

Scientists also revealed that both sexes slow their speech to sound more attractive and can also manipulate their voices to sound more intelligent.

A series of experiments at Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania, proved that women have little trouble in lowering their voices to sound sexier.

Susan Hughes, associate professor of psychology at the university, said: ‘This ability may be due to culture and cuts across cultures and time. There is a stereotype of what is a sexual voice in our culture – a low, breathy voice.’

The study, which will be published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, examined the patterns that emerge when men and women intentionally modify their voices to project four traits related to mate selection and competition – sexiness, dominance, intelligence and confidence – and how others perceive these manipulations.

A total of 40 men and women provided intentionally manipulated voice samples for the desired traits, plus a normal speech sample which involved counting from one to 10, while a panel of another 40 people assessed the degree to which each sample effectively projected the given trait. 

The researchers found that women could make their voices sound more attractive, but men could not.

‘In fact, although not significantly, it got a bit worse when men tried to sound sexy,’ Dr Hughes said.

Women can fake dominance but not confidence: The study found that women could not sound more confident, unlike men such as Jeremy Clarkson (pictured left) but both sexes can make their voices sound more dominant, such as Margaret Thatcher (right) who took vocal coaching before she became Prime Minister

Psychologists have previously claimed that the secret of seduction lies in a husky voice.

A 2010 study found that both women and men subconsciously lower their pitch when they are flirting.

The technique is particularly used over the phone, when the usual signs of chemistry - eye contact, arm touching and hair flicking - will not work.

The study, which was also conducted at Albright College, dispels the idea that women adopt higher, more traditionally feminine tones, when they are attracted to someone.

The researchers tested 48 students of both sexes by asking them to look at images of people and then leave a scripted voicemail message for them.

The more attractive the person in the photo, the lower the tone of voice used in the answerphone message, they found.

The study suggests that the difference is rooted in mate selection and says that women know that men place greater emphasis on looks when choosing a partner and that whether a voice sounds sexy can indicate physical beauty.

‘Thus, it is beneficial for women to sound sexier to enhance their value to potential mates and to stave off competition from rival females,’ the study says.

Spectogram analysis, which visually represents sound frequencies, found that both sexes can manipulate their voices to sound more intelligent.

However, the study found that women could not sound more confident. Men could, but only when judged by women.

The researchers think that men have the ability to sound more confident because they know it can attract women who are looking for indications of financial and personal success in a potential partner.

Men may be more attuned to detecting male posturing and more inclined to underrate their competition.

In charge: The researchers found that men and women could both manipulate their voices to sound more dominant. They believe that this may indicate a cultural shift because more women perform traditionally male-dominated roles (pictured) who may have chosen to modify their voices to sound more formidable

 researchers were surprised to find that both men and women could 
both manipulate their voices to sound more dominant.

They believe that this may indicate a cultural shift because there are more women performing traditionally male-dominated roles and leadership positions, who may have chosen to modify their voices to sound more formidable, as demonstrated by Margaret Thatcher, who received vocal training to sound more domineering in her bid to become Prime Minister.

The experts think their study could be used for voice coaching actors and politicians who want to communicate more effectively with an audience.

This could be because women conform to a stereotype of what men find attractive by putting on a lower, hoarse voice to boost their sex appeal
