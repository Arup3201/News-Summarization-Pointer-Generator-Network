Lord Ouseley, the country’s leading  anti-discrimination campaigner, has slammed the FA for attempting to sweep the scandal of David Elleray’s racist comment under the Wembley carpet.

The FA announced their case closed against former top referee Elleray after an internal probe, just as Sports Agenda revealed the retired Harrow School housemaster had racially abused FA employee Robert McCarthy, a referee coaching manager, during a summit at St George’s Park.

Elleray, 59, who sits on FA, UEFA and FIFA referee committees, has been slapped on the wrist for breaching the FA Council code of conduct and told to have diversity and equality training.

Adamant: Lord Ouseley says Elleray must not be allowed to get away with his racist comments and should resign

Ouseley believes Elleray should resign his football positions after his wholly unacceptable remark to McCarthy: ‘You look rather tanned, have you been down a coal mine.’

Ouseley, highly-respected chairman of Kick It Out, said: ‘It beggars belief the way the FA have tried to close this issue down before anyone has even  found out about it. There is a real problem here in how the FA operates.

‘The process should be clear and transparent and it’s not. It beggars belief how the FA believe their campaign to fight racism can ever be trusted or taken seriously if Elleray is allowed to get away with making a proven racist comment and remain in office.

'It would show far greater leadership and responsibility if he relinquishes his roles in football, admitting his mistake.

Investigation: The FA said that no official complaint was made about the incident

‘Elleray is a highly intelligent man, so what’s the point of him having training at his age. It’s just a load of nonsense and this is the same FA who took the high moral ground over Richard Scudamore’s sexism email exchanges at the  Premier League.

'Such blatant racism by a senior high-profile figure can’t just be conveniently  forgotten by the FA, it doesn’t add up.’

The FA say Elleray has apologised unreservedly, there was no official complaint and a thorough investigation took place.

Sue Barker, highly-rated at the Beeb for her stellar presenting role at Wimbledon, has been offered a new three-year deal to keep anchoring the corporation’s flagship sports event and A Question of Sport.

And Barker, who was seen as possibly winding down her broadcasting career when she opted out of  co-hosting Sports Personality Of The Year in 2013, is almost certain to accept the contract because of her love of tennis and the long-running quiz show.

Staying power: Sue Barker will be offered a new three year deal to anchor events such as Wimbledon

Barker will be 61 in three years and her longevity is very useful to the BBC in fighting multiple claims of ageism against women broadcasters.

Meanwhile, BBC tennis producer Paul Davies always starts Wimbledon by telling his team it’s up for grabs who commentates on the showcase matches.

But it’s becoming very predictable that Mark Petchey is given the women’s final and Andrew Castle gets the men’s.

One BA flight on Sunday will screen the Wimbledon’s men’s singles final live as part of a test run.

Flying high: Novak Djokovic's Wimbledon final against Roger Federer will be broadcast in the air by BA

But it’s unlikely the passions for Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer will make the plane wobble, which is what happened on a Brazil domestic flight when David Luiz scored against Chile.

Wimbledon, keen to upgrade their Champions Dinner location from the InterContinental Hotel in Hyde Park, are moving the end-of-tournament bash to the Royal Opera House.

The Savoy has been the traditional venue over the years, but a price couldn’t be agreed after its recent refurbishment even by the fabulously wealthy All England Club.

There have been numerous false dawns at the Lawn Tennis Association, but there is now genuine confidence that new Australian director of player development Bob Brett can arrest the long decline.

Decision time: Bob Brett will have to find a coach for promising teenager Kyle Edmund (above)

Brett doesn’t start work at Roehampton until September, but his analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of Britain’s top 20 players, based on 60 days of assessment and delivered to an LTA board meeting this week, impressed all the directors.

His first task will be to sort out the fiasco of Greg Rusedski being assigned to coach Britain’s highest-ranked teenager, Kyle Edmund, at the player’s request when the 40-year-old has too many other commitments to do a proper job.
