BBC staff have been complaining to bosses that they keep hurting their feet on new revolving doors at the Corporation's HQ.

A string of complaints have been made by workers who keep injuring themselves as they go through the moving doors at the revamped Broadcasting House in London's West End.

The complaints include one from BBC 'project technologist' Rob Pobjoy who says he hurts either his toes or heel depending on how fast he walks through the spinning entrance.

Hazard: Staff have been complaining about the new revolving doors at the BBC's Broadcasting House HQ

Mr Pobjoy said: 'Most days on my way in and out of New Broadcasting House, I often find my heel being pushed by the revolving door.

'As far as I'm aware, I walk at a normal pace. Yet, it seems to me that if I attempt to keep pace, I seem to be going too fast, resulting in my toes kicking the door.'

He added: 'It is my belief that the compartment is too small.'

Another BBC worker, Ian Jolly, who works in the BBC's newsroom, said that despite 'going through doors all of his life', the revolving doors were 'over-engineered'.

Writing in the BBC's internal Aerial magazine he said: 'I've been going through doors all my life.

'In fact, I'm pretty good at it, but I've clearly lost my touch now I'm working at Broadcasting House.

'I've been told my problem is that I 'go through the door too late'.

'Funny, as it's never been an issue before - could it be the BBC's over-engineered, electronic revolving doors that are at fault?'

In a spin: Employees say they keep hitting their toes or heels on the electronic doors

One BBC worker, who asked not to be named, said: 'The revolving doors are a bit of a pain - they seem to have a mind of their own.

'However, as long as the Director General's job doesn't become a revolving door and we get a bit of stability after George [Entwistle] then everyone will be happy.'

The revamped headquarters, which cost around £1bn to redesign, saw more than 6,000 staff from Audio and Music and News and Vision departments move in at the start of the year.

Another employee said each compartment is 'just that little bit too small', and added: 'You have to time it perfectly to make sure you don’t come a cropper.

'When new members of staff come here they regularly comment on the doors being difficult to judge. After a while you learn to master the doors, but you shouldn’t have to really.'

He said the problem appeared to be that staff 'misjudged' the speed of the doors, with some staff saying they go to fast and others saying they go to slow.

He added: 'You hit your toes and if you try to hang back your heel takes the brunt.'

The BBC declined to comment.
