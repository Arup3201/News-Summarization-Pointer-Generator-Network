Tipping the scales at less than six stone and dangerously thin, Ollie Orchard, now 22, was struggling with anorexia when he first joined a gym at the age of 18.

Four years later, Mr Orchard, from Bristol, has turned his life around and is now a fighting fit bodybuilder after using the sport to beat the eating disorder.

He now weighs a beefy 18-stone, has dedicated himself to pursuing a career in the sport and happily munches his way through 5,000 calories a day in order to maintain his new physique.

Speaking about his life-saving passion for the sport, Mr Orchard said: 'I shaved my hair off, took out my piercings and started lifting weights, it was a move that saved my life.'

His battle against the eating disorder began at the age of 14, when he was a self-described 'Emo kid' and began starving himself to fit in.

'It started when I was about 14 years-old with anorexia and as it progressed it just got uglier,' he explains.

'I was an Emo kid with long hair and piercings and I was going to be as skinny as I could. Not eating was part of the fashion, it's a big thing, it dictates a lifestyle.'

Although he often fainted because of his restricted diet, Mr Orchard managed to convince himself that all was well, despite the danger he was putting himself in.

'I was disgusted by food, it repulsed me,' he confesses. 'I picked up on the sound of people eating. If I saw people eating I would wonder how they could do it.

Emo is a type of rock music characterised by confessional lyrics and pioneered by bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.

Its popularity peaked in the early noughties, courtesy of platinum selling bands Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional.

Like punk and grunge, emo is also associated with fashion, in this case low-slung, colourful skinny jeans worn with band t-shirts, multiple piercings and rainbow-coloured hair.

The genre has been criticised for its angsty outlook and has been linked to a number of teen suicides.

'For me it was all about being as small as I could. It was a form of control. It was an addiction.'

He added: 'It was weird. I enjoyed it, I revelled in it. It was about pushing myself as far as I could. I would pass out through lack of eating but I would convince myself it was fine. Nobody could convince me otherwise.'

Salvation came in the shape of a visit to the gym at the age of 18 on the advice of his doctor and a former girlfriend.

There he met a strength coach who encouraged him to take up the sport, and after gaining some weight, he began lifting weights in earnest.

Today he eats 5,000 calories a day six days a week and up to 10,000 calories on a Sunday when he treats himself to fast food.

He added: 'You are very alienated with anorexia and although there are people in the gym it is still very much a personal journey.

'I started by barely being able to lift 5kg because I was so small so I had to first work at putting some meat back on my bones.

'I started reading body building mags and based my diet around that so would eat things like oats and egg whites but also started eating food like ice cream.

'It was tough on my stomach because it had been so small but I was determined to put weight on.'

During the first year of training, Mr Orchard gained 10 stone and managed to achieve second place in his first bodybuilding competition before going on to compete in the British finals.

'I'm fit and healthy and focussing on doing something to my body that does not put my life at risk,' he added.

'Eating disorders are a bigger problem than people realise and all I would say is try and find something that can give you the same control and satisfaction.

'For me it was bodybuilding because I need the focus of the training and meals but anything that helps you beat it can only be a good thing.'
