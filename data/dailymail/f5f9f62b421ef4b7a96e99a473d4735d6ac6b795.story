A Florida pastor shot and wounded an employee Tuesday morning in a gunfight after he told the man he was being fired. 

Terry L. Howell, 61, was trying to fire Benjamin Parangan Jr., 47, Tuesday morning around 8am when the angered maintenance worker opened fire on the pastor, the Orlando Sentinel reports. 

Parangan, who had worked for the Living Water Fellowship church in  Kissimmee for 9 years, is in  stable condition at Osceola Regional Medical Center facing a charge of aggravated assault with intent to kill as well as other pending charges.

Witnesses told FOX that Howell was meeting with Parangan to fire him when Parangan pulled out a handgun and fired at the pastor several times and missed. 

Howell reacted in self-defense, police say, when he pulled out his own pistol and fired back, wounding the man.

Both men have concealed-weapon permits, according to the Sheriff's Office

Statement: Howell wrote a statement released by the Sheriff's Office on behalf of the church, which he founded in 2000, saying the church fully supports the Sheriff's Office's ongoing investigation

The Sentinel reports that detectives are investigating the incident as a case of self defense, and Parangan will be booked into the Osceola County Jail when he is released from the hospital. 

Two people reportedly witnessed the incident that occurred in the church's administration office and about 16 children were in the church complex during the shooting.

None were harmed and all were picked up by their parents that morning. 

Cancelled: A post on the church's Facebook page indicates that their New Year's Eve service has been cancelled due to the incident

Howell wrote a statement released by the Sheriff's Office on behalf of the church, which he founded in 2000, saying the church fully supports the Sheriff's Office's ongoing investigation, according to the Washington Times. 

'We will continue to cooperate with the investigators in every way that we can,' Howell wrote.

'Until the investigation is complete, we will not be making any public statements. Thank you for understanding. The members of our church will continue to pray for all those involved in this morning's incident. We would ask all who read this release to do the same.'

A post on the church's Facebook page indicates that their New Year's Eve service has been cancelled due to the incident.
