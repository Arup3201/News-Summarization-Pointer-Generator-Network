The founder of Wikipedia has urged the Government to block America's extradition of a British student on copyright charges in another attack on the 'dangerous' treaty between the two countries.

Jimmy Wales, 45, has spoken out in support of Richard O’Dwyer, 24, who faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of charges relating to his website, TVShack.net, which linked to other sites that streamed pirated television programmes.

Mr Wales, who has met Mr O’Dwyer, today called on Home Secretary Theresa May 
to stop the extradition, which was approved by a district judge in 
January, calling the student 'the human 
face of the battle between the content industry and the interests of the
general public.'

'O’Dwyer is not a U.S. citizen, he’s lived in the UK all his life, his 
site was not hosted there, and most of his users were not from the U.S.,' Mr Wales wrote in the Guardian.

'The internet as a whole must not tolerate censorship in response to 
mere allegations of copyright infringement. As citizens we must stand up
for our rights online.

'Given the thin case against him, 
it is an outrage that he is being extradited to the US to face felony 
charges for something that he is not being prosecuted for here. No US 
citizen has ever been brought to the UK for alleged criminal activity 
that took place on US soil.'

Britain's extradition treaty with the US has already been branded ‘unbalanced’ by MPs who have  called for it to be urgently reformed.

The Government is under huge pressure to renegotiate the Act and the Mail has also launched its Affront to British Justice 
campaign in support of Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon, who hacked into U.S. military computers from the bedroom of his North London flat.

Mr Wales' plea is yet another call for it to be changed, with O’Dwyer’s supporters arguing that as the site did not host material 
itself he should not face any charges and should therefore not be 
extradited.

Mr Wales, in a petition on the Change.org website, said TV Shack was 'similar to a search engine'.

'When I met 
Richard (along with his mother), he struck me as a clean-cut, geeky kid.
Still a university student, he is precisely the kind of person one can 
imagine launching the next big thing on the internet,' he said today.

'Enthusiastic, with a sharp mind and a quick wit, he reminds me of many 
great entrepreneurs. He tried to follow the law, and I would argue that 
he very likely succeeded in doing so.'

Mr Wales argued that Mr O’Dwyer, from Bolsover in Derbyshire but 
studying in Sheffield, always did his best to play by the rules, saying 
that on the few occasions he received requests to remove content from 
copyright holders, he complied.

'Copyright is an important institution, serving a beneficial moral and economic purpose,'  he wrote.

'But that does not mean that copyright can or should be unlimited.

'It does not mean that we should abandon time-honoured moral and legal 
principles to allow endless encroachments on our civil liberties in the 
interests of the moguls of Hollywood.'

It is the latest move by Mr Wales into a political arena.

Earlier this year Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, blacked out the English language version of its website in protest at anti-piracy laws being considered by the US government.

Supporters include the film and music industry, which often sees its products sold illegally. They say the legislation is needed to protect intellectual property and jobs.

Julia O’Dwyer, Richard’s mother, said Mr Wales’s intervention was a huge boost to their campaign.

'It is obviously quite significant to have Jimmy Wales’s support,” she said.

'He didn’t do that lightly. He spent a lot of time talking to Richard.

'It has concentrated efforts to get the message across to the Government, because it is in their hands.'

She said Mr O’Dwyer was due to have an appeal heard at the High Court in October or November this year.

Mr O’Dwyer is one of several high-profile cases of Britons being extradited to the US under a treaty signed in 2003, which critics say is unfairly biased against British citizens.

He told The Guardian that he was coping 'quite well' with the threat of extradition.

'It does get in the way, it distracts you... if you thought about extradition all day you’d never get any work done. It’d be a horrible mess,' he said.

'It’s quite difficult but I think I’m managing quite well.

'I think about it sometimes during the day, but I try to think about other things that are more important. I don’t let their extradition warrant ruin my life.

'Otherwise you’d fail university, just sit in your room all day moaning. They’d be winning if I let it do that.'

A Home Office spokesman said today: 'We have effective, fair and balanced extradition arrangements with the US and other international partners.

'People who have committed serious offences such as murder, rape, other sex crimes and fraud, have been successfully extradited to the UK and convicted.

'It should also be noted that our courts have refused to extradite nine people requested by the US since 2004, while US courts have not refused any of our extradition requests.”

Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: 'It is very significant that a giant of the internet has joined the campaign against Britain’s dangerously unfair extradition laws.

'The world-wide nature of the web leaves people incredibly vulnerable to being dragged across the world to face trial when they never left their bedrooms, let alone their country.

'We need far more safeguards and judicial discretion if a great deal of injustice and suffering is to be prevented.'
