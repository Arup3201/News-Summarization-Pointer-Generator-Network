A man was being questioned by police last night after his estranged wife and two young daughters were found dead in their home.

Marta Galikowska, 27, and children Maja, five, and Olga, 18 months, are believed to have been stabbed to death in a frenzied attack.

Neighbours alerted by the sound of a ‘blazing row’ and screaming found their bodies lying in pools of blood at their semi-detached council home.

Police called to the scene on Sunday evening arrested a man believed to be Mrs Galikowska’s estranged husband Marcin – also known as Martin – as he loaded belongings into the car on the driveway of the house.

Neighbour Matthew Houghton, 30, said: ‘My brother said he heard a woman screaming, that someone was being killed, so we ran up the street.

‘There was a woman already on the phone to the police. She was hysterical, saying they were all dead, that they’d all been stabbed.

‘She’d been in the house and seen it. Another woman who lives next door is a nurse, and she’d been inside too and checked their pulse, but they were all dead.’

Friends of the family and residents on the quiet estate in the Stanfield area of Stoke-on-Trent spoke yesterday of their shock at the tragedy.

They said the Galikowskas had seemed a loving family but the couple are understood to have separated shortly before Christmas last year.

The pair, who attended a local Roman Catholic church, are believed to have met around seven years ago, after they both moved from Poland to the UK to look for work, and married in 2008 – shortly before the birth of their first daughter.

Mr Galikowska found work in a timber yard then as a refuse collector, while Mrs Galikowska had worked as a waitress and at clothes store TK Maxx before becoming a full-time mother.

Dorota, 32, who became friends with Mrs Galikowska when both worked at a branch of TK Maxx, said: ‘She was a lovely girl, very easy-going and always happy.

‘She seemed to really enjoy being a mum.’

Another friend, Anna Gemzala, 32, said: ‘I can’t believe it. I would see Marta and the kids at the Polish church. They are a nice family. They have beautiful children, it’s so sad.’

Friends described the couple as dedicated and proud parents.

One neighbour said: ‘They adored little Maja – she was so pretty and lively so when they had another little girl everyone was pleased for them.

‘We used to see them in the street and they were perfect. The little girl had a beaming smile. It is absolutely heartbreaking.’

Sunny Miah, 45, the couple’s former landlord, said: ‘I really can’t believe it, they were such a loving, friendly, pleasant couple.

‘It is an absolute tragedy. They were both very hardworking and dedicated and seemed very much in love with each other.’

A spokesman for Staffordshire Police said a 27-year-old man was arrested at the house and was helping with their inquiries.

He said: ‘Officers have traced and are in the process of informing their immediate family.

‘They are being offered specialist support.’
