A mother and her daughter were killed, and her son was seriously injured Monday after a man attacked them with a baseball bat in their Florida home.

The attacker, believed to have been the live-in boyfriend of the daughter, is said to have fled the house with the bat, before apparently drowning himself in a nearby lake.

Neighbors claimed the suspected killer, James Earl Jones, struggled with mental health issues and had not been taking his medication.

Attack: A mother and daughter were killed and her son was seriously injured after being beaten by a baseball bat at this Florida home Monday

Police were called to the home at about 4.30pm on Monday, where they found the body of one victim inside, and two seriously injured victims outside. One later died in hospital.

They said the suspected killer was still holding the bat believed to have been used in the attack, but he dropped it and ran off.

The victims were named Tuesday morning as Shannon Marie Ratliff, Mavis Ratliff and Eddie Dean Ratliff.

Tavares spokeswoman Joyce Ross told Mail Online that an aluminum baseball bat had been used in the brutal attack.

Ross confirmed that Jones's death was being treated as a suspected suicide, and said the investigation was on going.

The body of Jones was found on Monday floating in Lake Dora. Early indications suggest he drowned himself, police said.Â

Those involved in the tragic attack are said to have been aged from 40 to 55 and all shared the house.

The
 sole survivor, Eddie Dean Ratliff, is in critical condition and 
undergoing surgery Tuesday. He is a sanitation worker who has worked for
 the city for 25 years.

'He runs my route. I see him all the time. He's a great guy' the town's mayor, Robert Wolfe, said.

Friends of the Ratliff family said that Jones suffered from mental health issues and would 'snap' if he failed to take his medication.

'He'll snap if he didn't take his meds. He just will snap. You see it right here,' Ronterius Hubbard Sr, who has known the suspect and victims for years, told Click Orlando.

Virginia Hall, who worked with the suspect's girlfriend at a nearby store, said: ' I know that he had certain issues. We heard that he hadn't been on his medicine for about a month. He could be violent, but I've never seen them fight.'
