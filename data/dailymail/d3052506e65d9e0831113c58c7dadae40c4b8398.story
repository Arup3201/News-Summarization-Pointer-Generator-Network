The collapse of Easter Island's civilisation is often used as a cautionary tale to show the folly of humans who over-exploit their surroundings.

But a group of leading U.S scientists now believe the tale - which documents how the population collapsed due to deforestation - is completely false and 'misleading'.

Legend says the island's landscape was washed away by the destruction of the palm forests, which ruined the fertile soil and forced the population to descend into  cannibalism.

A group of leading U.S scientists says that the tale about Easter Island's demise due to deforestation and cannibalism is completely false and 'misleading'

But research published yesterday says the population was actually decimated by the arrival of Europeans - who brought syphilis, smallpox and slavery onto the land.

The scientists believe that many inhabitants survived perfectly well after the final tree was cut down, which goes against the wide belief that the island's inhabitants caused their own downfall.

The academics reached their conclusion by looking at tools used by the islanders for farming, which were scattered around the land. 

They found that, instead of there being a sudden collapse in farming, there was a much more gradual decline in some areas. 

The findings by the Virginia Commonwealth University have now been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 

The study will come as welcome news to the Rapa Nui - the indigenous name for the islanders - who have never been keen on the narrative about how their own stupidity ruined Easter Island. 

Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited island in the world, more than 2,180 miles away from the coast of Chile and 1,289 miles from the nearest inhabited island

Speaking about the concept of 'collapse', Professor Sue Hamilton - who was not directly involved in the study - told The Times: 'It is a terrible presumption to say there was a food shortage.'She added: 'Starvation is not an automatic result of tree removal and neither is warfare.'  

Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited island in the world, more than 2,180 miles away from the coast of Chile and 1,289 miles from the nearest inhabited island.

Yet the main belief is that it is thought that shortly before 1200 AD, Polynesians sailed to the island and began to settle there. 

The population on the island grew quickly as settlements were formed, thriving for hundreds of years.

Some scientists estimate that at its height, Easter Island's population may have been as much as 20,000 people. 

Some experts believe the fertile land allowed the population time to develop a rich culture and gave them time to carve the distinctive moai stone heads that the island is now famous for.

Around 1200 AD, the inhabitants apparently began cutting down the island's subtropical trees and giant palms in large numbers to build canoes and to transport the giant stone statues.

However, the destruction of the palm forests that covered the island led to much of the fertile soil washing away, damaging the natural wildlife.

That's when people began to starve. In a last ditch effort at survival, they became cannibals. 

Legend says that the collapse of the island's ecology and civilization was so complete that by the time the Dutch arrived in the 1700s, Easter Island was a sandy grassland void of nearly all its native wildlife.

Its human inhabitants were reduced to a starving population of 3,000 or less, scientists say.
