Rare travel posters advertising far flung destinations before the start of the jet age are set to fetch £200,000 at auction.

The collection of 200 works were used to advertise dream holiday destinations and the luxurious ways of reaching them, including one of the Hindenburg Zeppelin.

Most of the Art Deco posters date back to the 1920s and 1930s, just before the invention of the jet engine kick-started the golden age of travel.

Travel posters from the 1920s and 30s - before the age of jet travel - are to be auctioned in New York. This poster for French cruise-liner L'Atlantique (left) and another for the 'Normandie' (right) from 1931 and 1935 are valued at £20,000 and £15,000 respectively and are the most expensive in the sale

The artworks track the progress of air travel from the Hindenburg Zeppelin (left) in 1936 to the birth of the first airlines to use planes, such as this Palestine Airways advert from 1938 (right)

This 1951 print captures the glory days of post-war British steam travel and has been valued at £3,000

They are a celebration of the various modes of transport used by wealthy tourists in the days before easyJet and package holidays.

They include vintage steam trains taking people to see the sites of London or across America to California and opulent trans-Atlantic cruise liners and Zeppelin airships.

Dream destinations depicted in the colourful billboards include Bali, South Africa, Australia, Monte Carlo, Mexico, India, Brazil, Sri Lanka, New York, Egypt and Burma.

London before the Blitz - this pre-war poster shows Whitehall as it appeared before the start of World War Two

Far-flung: these two posters for Australia show how advertising changed over the years. The left hand image is from 1936 - valued at £4,000 - and the right image is from 1957 - valued at £2,000

One of the posters in the collection of 200 works is this design from 1929 which advertises Monatauk, in New York state

The posters are all from the original print-runs, the most expensive of which is French artist Adolphe Cassandre’s 1931 poster advertising the cruise liner, L’Atlantique, which took passengers to South America, valued at £20,000.

The next most valuable lot at £15,000 is a 1935 poster for the famous French cruise liner, Normandie, which had made the fastest Atlantic crossing at the time.

There are several posters marking Britain’s golden age of steam, and 
one is Terence Cuneo’s ‘Forging Ahead’ poster which marked the 
production of British Rail’s Britannia class of locomotives in 1951.

These two posters are the oldest in the collection, dating from 1909, and advertise the airshow at Templehof in Berlin, and the 1909 Air festival in Ohio. They have a combined value of £32,500

Iconic: many of the destinations advertised in the Art Deco works are still huge tourist destinations today

Exotic: visually stunning, these two posters entice travellers with a taste of the exotic in India and Bali

Another
 British Rail gem is a billboard for the London, Midlands and Scottish 
Railway company showing a beautiful view of London’s Whitehall from St 
James’ Park, which will cost a collector £3,000.

German artist
 Ottomar Anton's design depicts the ill-fated Hindenburg, which crashed 
to Earth in a fireball in 1937, killing 36 people.

The collection also includes two posters that carry a colourful image looking down on the skyscrapers of New York’s Lower Manhattan and out to the Statue of Liberty in 1935.

Steaming ahead: many of the works advertise the benefits of railways as air travel was still in its infancy

Rare: the collection of vintage images are being sold by Swann Auction Galleries in New York

In the days before photography became a viable option for advertisers companies relied on artists to pain a vivid picture in the minds of potential customers

The works of art are being sold by the Swann Auction Galleries in New York on October 18.

Rebecca Weiss, from the auction room, said: 'These are dazzling but scarce images of destinations across the globe and air, sea and rail travel adverts.

'The posters advertise diverse geographical locations from the deserts of the Middle East to the Alpine resorts of Europe.

'Before TV and the internet, how did you advertise the romance and excitement if travel? You had to create a visual element that excited and entice the public.

'People have a favourite place where they holidayed and when you find a beautiful, sunlit image of that place on a poster it is very easy to fall in love with.'
