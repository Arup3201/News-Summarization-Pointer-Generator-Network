More than 700 more Ebola cases emerged in West Africa in one week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said, showing that the outbreak is accelerating.

Just three weeks ago the number of new cases was around 500 for a seven-day period.

The number of people believed to have been killed is now more than 2,600, an increase of roughly 200 from the last estimate, the WHO said. Most deaths have been in Liberia.

The new figures from the UN health agency show that the disease is thought to have affected more than 5,300 people. Just under half of those cases were recorded in the last three weeks.

Some 318 healthcare workers have fallen ill, and about half have died.

The outbreak has struck Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Nigeria and Senegal.

Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says the number of Ebola cases is doubling every three weeks and is calling for a 20-fold increase in aid totalling almost $1billion to tackle the virus's worst-ever outbreak over the next six months.

The UN chief told an emergency meeting of the Security Council today that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa 'demands the attention of the world' and 'unprecedented' action.

Ban announced that he is establishing a UN emergency mission to address the unprecedented challenge.

He thanked U.S. President Barack Obama for sending 3,000 troops to provide expertise in training and engineering, read the names of about 20 other countries that have responded with contributions and urged all nations coming to the UN General Assembly ministerial meeting next week to follow suit.

Aid workers attacked by people they went to help

Six men trying to warn Guinea villagers of the dangers have been attacked by the people they were trying to help.

The country's government have been sending aid workers to remote areas and on Tuesday six people – three journalists and the director and two senior doctors of a regional hospital – were assaulted at Womey in the district Nzérékoré on Tuesday and have been missing since.

To prevent more outsiders venturing to their homes, the villagers have destroyed all bridges leading to the area.

'The meeting started off well; the traditional chiefs welcomed the delegation with 10 kola nuts as a traditional greeting,' a local resident who was present at the meeting earlier this week and gave only his first name, Yves told The Guardian. 'It was afterwards that some youths came out and started stoning them. They dragged some of them away, and damaged their vehicles.
