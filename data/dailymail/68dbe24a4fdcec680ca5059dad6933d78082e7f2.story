Ronny Deila has expressed hope that a compromise deal can still be reached to keep Kris Commons at Celtic beyond the end of the season.

Commons spoke out after the 4-3 Europa League defeat from Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday evening, insisting the current deal on the table was unacceptable and confirming he was after a longer agreement to fulfil his wish of remaining in Glasgow.

Deila responded on Friday by stating that the 31-year-old had not simply been offered a 12-month extension, but rather that the club was trying to ‘structure’ a deal with the potential for a longer stay if certain criteria are met.

English clubs are monitoring the impasse ahead of next month’s transfer window, but Deila claimed Celtic were happy to keep working towards a possible agreement.

‘It’s about negotiation,’ said Deila. ‘Kris wants something, we want something and it’s about agreeing on something that we both want to do. ‘It is not right to say that he is only being offered a one-year deal. We are talking about a structured deal. That’s where the difference is.

‘There is no deadline for an agreement. He has a contract until the end of the season, so there is no big rush. The rush will be if he can find some other clubs in January. But if he looks at the contract, he is going to stay here for the rest of the season.

‘It’s not a case of him being offered the contract and told to take it or leave it. Not from our side. If it’s from him, then he is playing a hardball game and we will see.

‘I still see a future for him here. He is a good player.’ Asked if the contract could be appearance-linked, Deila said: ‘That’s the structure of the deal, yes. We are talking about different things when you have older players. I had the same thing at Stromsgodset. If older players get very long contracts, then you never know with them.

‘If they get a bad injury, how long can they keep up? Are they keeping their legs? And when is their passion gone? So if you give them a long contract it is a risk for the club. That’s why we need to think about what we are doing.

‘But of course there are circumstances which could keep him here for three or four years. That’s up to Kris and the club to agree.  

Commons is adamant he wants to remain with Celtic but made it clear better terms will have to be put forward

'It is a positive thing that both parties want it.’ Meanwhile, Celtic are waiting to discover if they will be back in the UEFA dock after a flare was let off among their supporters at the game in Zagreb.

If UEFA match delegate Miroslaw Ryszka includes the incident — which led to a clash with Croatian police — then Celtic are likely to face punishment.

Club officials had told supporters not to bring flares to the game and warned that it could lead to disciplinary action from the governing body.
