Sheffield United midfielder Stefan Scougall has every belief another romantic chapter in the cup 'fairytale' he has experienced since joining the club can be written on Wednesday when they attempt to secure a swift return to Wembley Stadium.

Following his switch to the Sky Bet League One outfit from Livingston a year ago, Scougall has helped United spring a series of shocks and make considerable progress in knockout competitions.

That has included beating Barclays Premier League Fulham last term en route to a Wembley FA Cup semi-final against Hull, in which he scored to put his team 2-1 up before they eventually lost 5-3.

The 22-year-old Scot has also been involved in an upset against top-flight opposition in this season's FA Cup when QPR were despatched in the third round, as well a run in the Capital One Cup that has seen Nigel Clough's men defeat another Premier League side in West Ham and then one more in Southampton to set up a last-four clash with Tottenham.

The Blades contest the second leg of the semi-final against Spurs on Wednesday evening at Bramall Lane trailing 1-0 from last week's initial encounter.

And on the prospect of United turning the tie around and making the Wembley final, Scougall said: 'It has been a fairytale for me so far, only a year into my contract and having played in two semi-finals.

'To this day, I still don't really think it's true I scored at Wembley.

'This is a chance to get back there, and hopefully on Wednesday night we can put things right and play there in a final.

'It is a major stadium and to play there at any stage of your career is a great moment for you, your family and friends, and for your club and team-mates.'

Reflecting on last Wednesday's first leg, which saw Spurs - who are sixth in the Premier League - take the lead through a second-half Andros Townsend penalty, Scougall added: 'Especially in the first half, we felt we had a good go at them and were maybe unlucky not to be 1-0 up.

'In the second half we maybe came off it a little bit or they maybe upped their game a little bit, but the main objective was to stay in the tie and it is still very much alive.

'There is nothing for us to fear and we are going to try to cause an upset - like what happened at the weekend (in the FA Cup fourth round) with Middlesbrough beating Manchester City and Bradford beating Chelsea.

'We have proved ourselves over the last year whenever we have played a team in a higher league that there is nothing to fear. We can go out and cause another upset.

'I think you will have around 30,000 Blades fans at Bramall Lane on Wednesday night, so I think that is going to help us and drive us on a little bit more.

'Hopefully we can give them something to cheer about.'

Midfielder Ryan Flynn (Achilles) is United's only injury doubt ahead of Wednesday's game.

After making eight changes for the 1-1 FA Cup draw at Preston on Saturday, Blades boss Clough looks set to revert back to a similar side to that which started the first leg against Spurs.

Kieran Wallace and Che Adams, both cup-tied at the weekend, are available again while Kieron Freeman, who is one of three new signings United made last week, could come into the squad.
