It is a case of Pride and Extreme Prejudice. Colin Firth, still best known for playing Jane Austen’s  romantic hero Mr Darcy, is slain in cold blood on  the set of his latest movie.

In The Secret Service,  currently being filmed  in Surrey, the actor puts well-mannered Georgian etiquette behind him to play the suave, highly trained British spy Jack London.

But as these pictures show, it appears his character meets a brutal end at the hands of his sniggering nemesis, The Villain – played by Samuel L. Jackson.

The role is a return to type for Jackson, who played another stone-hearted hitman, Jules, in Pulp Fiction.

But the scene might not be all it seems, as the movie is based on a comic book series known for its fantastical plot twists.

Meanwhile, a new Darcy is about to hit TV screens in the form of actor Matthew Rhys.

He will play the character in a BBC adaptation of Death Comes To Pemberley by  P. D. James.

The three-part drama picks up on the lives of Darcy  and wife Elizabeth six years after Pride And Prejudice leaves off.
