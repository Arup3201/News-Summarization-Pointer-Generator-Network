Cluttered and confusing parking signs that have left motorists truly baffled could soon be a thing of the past.

Signs with conflicting directions about parking across Sydney, could soon be replaced with colour-blocked visual signs indicating the 'time block' method.

The idea came to light by designer Nikki Sylianteng, from New York, who created the visual blocks of time when parking is allowed and not allowed after receiving 'one-too-many $95 tickets'.

It comes as the Local Government Association of NSW Board approved a plan for the colour-blocked time chart in Sydney.

The proposal has been passed to the Road and Maritime Services for review.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Local Government Association of NSW Board for comment.

Mosman Council has been embracing the idea of the easy-to-read time chart signs and has gained a significant amount of support from residents in the area.

'While this proposal is a major change to the status quo and any decision to introduce it will rest with RMS, it is a heartening first step,' Mosman Mayor Cr Peter Abelson told Mosman Daily last month.

'Parking signs are often ugly, complicated and difficult to understand with multiple instructions for different parts of the day or week.'

Meanwhile drivers have taken to social media to rant their confusion of the street signs across the country

Meanwhile drivers have taken to social media to rant their confusion as others are getting booked for 'parking illegally' despite thinking they're 'doing the right thing'.

Confused driver Grant Davis took to his Facebook account after he stumbled across cluttered and complicated parking signs in Seaforth, north-east of Sydney.

'So let me get this right…. I have to park on a 60 degree angle with the front of my car facing the kerb, but only if my vehicle is under 6 metres in length,' he posted.

'But I can't park here between 8.30am and 9am or 3pm and 3.30pm on school days… But buses ARE expected. Anywhere to my left though is for authorized car share vehicles…'

'BUT I can park here for 5 minutes between 7:30pm and 8:30am or 3:30pm and 4:30pm on school days only. However – the entire zone is a tow away area. 

'I kept driving because I figured it was a tow away zone. Cool - thanks Sydney City Council. Clear as mud.'
