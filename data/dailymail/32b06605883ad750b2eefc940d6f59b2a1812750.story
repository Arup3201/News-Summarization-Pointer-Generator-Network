The granddaughter of legendary Spanish artist Pablo Picasso is selling off a selection of his art work, as well as his famous French villa, for an expected $290million.

Marina Picasso, who has famously spoken of Picasso being incredibly cold and distant from herself and her brother when they were children, has put at least seven pieces of art up for grabs.

The offering includes a 1921 painting called 'Maternite' for $50m (£35m), his 1911 'Femme a la Mandoline' for $60m (£40m), and a 1923 portrait of his first wife Olga Khokhlova for $60m (£40m).

Marina Picasso (pictured), inherited a vast number of pieces of Picasso's art, as well his French villa, following his death

Two of the pieces thought to be up for sale are his 1921 Maternite (left) and the 1911 Femme a la Mandoline (right)

This 1923 portrait of Picasso's first wife Olga Khokhlova is also believed to soon be going on the market, at a price of $60m (£40m)

Marina Picasso poses in 2013 outside a lavish villa in Cannes once owned by her grandfather. It is now likely to go up for sale alongside several pieces of his art

She is selling the artwork to the clients personally and will meet with prospective buyers in Geneva, according to the The New York Post.

Also offered for sale is her grandfather's estate in Cannes, France, the paper reported.

Called 'La Californie', he lived at the villa with his second wife Jacqueline Roque, who shot herself aged 59 following his death.

It was at La Californie that she and her brother used to visit the artist as children, only to be told to wait at the gate by Roque until he finished working.

It has since become a museum and gallery open to the public after it was inherited by Ms Picasso following her grandfather and brothers' deaths.

Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, pictured in 1971, was a prolific painter throughout his lifetime 

Picasso's 1901 painting 'The Blue Room' (pictured) ranks among his most famous and prized pieces of work, as it ushered in his famed blue period featuring melancholy subjects. The piece is not believed to be for sale

Two other paintings by Picasso to become highly sought after are 'Woman's Head' (left) and 'Harlequin Head' (right). Both were stolen in two separate art heists in recent years

She is the son of Paulo Picasso, who in turn was himself the son of Picasso and his first wife Olga Khokhlova.

Although she had a world-renowned grand-father, she has said she grew up in poverty with Picasso unwilling to provide any financial assistance to the family.

In modern times, Picasso has become the most stolen artist in history due to his prolific output, recognisable signature and valuable works.

He has more than 1,000 paintings registered as stolen, missing or disputed, which is more than twice as many as the next on the list.

The artist's 1924 painting, titled 'Still Life With A Cake' (pictured), is valued at more than $300m. It was bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1998

This 1905 piece, 'Boy With A Pipe', was painted when Picasso was just 24 years old. When it was sold into private hands in 2004 for $104m (£71m), it became the most expensive painting ever sold
