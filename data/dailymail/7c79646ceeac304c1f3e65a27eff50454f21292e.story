The range of push-up bras on the market may mean there is no longer any need to stuff your bra with tissue each morning, but clearly hasn’t improved women’s confidence in their cup size.

Seven out of ten women are unhappy with the look and size of their bust, a new survey reveals, with 75 per cent of women choosing to wear a cleavage-enhancing bra every day.

Now George at Asda has released a new brassiere which, for the bargain price of £6, claims to give the same effect as a breast enhancement - increasing bra size by two cups.

The £6 bra comes in black, white and nude, and claims to increase your breasts by two sizes

The bra can be worn with or without straps, cross strap or halter-neck to enable it to work with any outfit

The 'Multi-miracle' bra promises to double women’s cleavage size while remaining flattering.

With curvaceous celebrities like Michelle Keegan, Helen Flanagan and Kelly Brook having the most envied busts, those less genetically blessed are forced to resort to artificial means to gain a fuller cleavage.

If you're not looking to go under the knife, underwear can seem like a perfect solution. 

However, despite Britain's dedication to cleavage-enhancing lingerie, many women claim to be dissatisfied with the choice available.

Some 64 per cent of women 
surveyed reported a lack of comfortable and functional strapless bras 
on the shelves.

George
hopes that their inexpensive version, which can be worn as both a 
strapless and halter-neck bra, will fill a gap in the market.

George’s previous ‘Two Sizes Bigger’ predecessor - the AbracadaBRA sold out within hours of launching and remains the top-selling bra on George.com, but does not come in a strapless option.

The new bra, priced at just £6, is available in white, nude and black and can be worn with or without straps, cross-strap or halter-neck.

Head of Design at George, Helen Low said: 'We know women don't want their underwear to restrict their fashion choices so we've launched a bra that can enhance, support and flatter without the worry of unsightly bra strap faux pas to give women that extra bit if confidence this party season.'
