A 28-year-old man wanted over a burglary spree in Orange County has been arrested after returning to the fast food restaurant he allegedly robbed the night before.

Daniel Lee Warn is accused of breaking into the El Pollo Loco Mexican chicken restaurant in Costa Mesa in the morning hours of July 16.

Police say he accessed the store using the driving thru window and was caught on camera climbing in, according to KTLA.

After employees realized the shop had been vandalized they called police and the surveilance footage was reviewed, showing a man wearing a bright green shirt and colorful baseball cap.
