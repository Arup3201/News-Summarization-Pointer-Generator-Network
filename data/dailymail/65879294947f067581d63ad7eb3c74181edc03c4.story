Jailed: Joshua Sadler, 21, was sentenced to 12 months after admitting dangerous driving

The mother of a teenager who was killed when a friend crashed his car just four days after passing his test has spoken of her shock after the driver was jailed for only 12 months.

Joshua Sadler, 21, lost control of his silver Renault Clio on a 60mph country road and smashed into a tree, killing front seat passenger Mikey Maguire, 19.

Sadler had previously been convicted of a 
string of serious motoring offences and twice banned from the road 
before he even had a licence.

He was seen on the night of the fatal crash performing handbrake turns and showing off in a car park.

Sadler
 pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was sentenced 
to 12 months in jail and banned him from driving for five years.

Afterwards Mr Maguire’s mother Allison Jarman, 43, described the sentence as an ‘insult’.

She said: 'When I was in court my head was in my hands and at one point I couldn’t even listen to what was happening.

'I
 expected the sentence to be low because I have been doing a lot of 
research online but when I heard it was 12 months it felt like a slap in
 the face.

'Nothing can 
bring Mikey back but 12 months for my son’s life is shocking. I was 
absolutely speechless, he will be out in three months.

'Mikey and Joshua had known each other for years but I was under the impression that they weren’t close any more.

'He
 had always been a bit of a troublemaker and had previous convictions 
for driving offences. I always said he would end up hurting someone one 
day, I just didn’t expect it to be my son.'

The fatal crash happened on Huntick Road, Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, Dorset, on February 8 last year.

Sadler, from Poole, lost control of his 
car on a bend before it ploughed down a grass bank and struck the tree. 
Mr Maguire was pronounced dead at the scene.

Sadler had previously been disqualified from driving after being convicted of two counts of aggravated vehicle taking.

He appeared in court for one of the counts and driving without a licence and insurance in July 2010.

In both incidents he lost control and caused more than £5,000 damage to one of the vehicles.

Les Smith, defending, read out a statement from Sadler to Bournemouth Crown Court in which he expressed ‘regret and sorrow’ for the Mr Maguire’s death.

He added: 'The incident haunts me every day and will do for the rest of my life. Nothing that is said or done to me can make me feel any worse.'

As well as being jailed Sadler was disqualified from driving for five years and ordered to take an extended test at the end of the ban.
