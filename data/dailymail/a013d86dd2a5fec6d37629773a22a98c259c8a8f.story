More than 100 corpses, many of them children, have been found washed up in a shallow tributary of the River Ganges.

Officials do not suspect a crime, and instead believe the dead were given water burials. It is Indian custom not to cremate unwed girls, and many poor people cannot afford cremation.

But their discovery has sparked renewed concerns about the health of the Ganges, a sacred river where millions of Hindus cremate their dead.

Grim find: Some of the more than 100 bodies found washed up in a tributary to the River Ganges, who are believed to be people whose families could not afford to cremate them or else girls given water burials

Macabre: Bodies are seen floating in Ganges river near Pariyar. Officials do not suspect a crime, but instead believe the dead were given water burials

The 102 bodies were found floating near the village of Pariyar, in Uttar Pradesh, India's most-populous state. 

They were too badly decomposed for post-mortem examinations or identification, officials said. DNA testing is being done to determine where the bodies might have come from.  

'Once we will complete all the legal formalities, these bodies will be buried to avoid spread of diseases,' Sub-Divisional Magistrate Saryua Shukla said.

Television footage showed dogs and birds feeding on the bloated and decaying bodies floating in the stream, whose waters are thought to have receded recently. 

Police inspector general Satish Ganesh said they were probably given river burials upstream at a cremation area known as Pariyar Ghat before becoming stranded in shallow water.

Millions of Hindus practice open-air cremation, with the ashes of loves ones scattered in the revered but heavily polluted Ganges.

But poor families who cannot afford enough wood and other materials for the burning ceremony sometimes place the bodies in the water, while others are not cremated entirely.

While it is illegal to dispose of the dead in rivers, some practicing Hindus also believe that giving an unwed girl a water burial will ensure she is born again into the family.

The bodies of some holy men are also placed in the river instead of being cremated, in accordance with tradition.

The Hindu nationalist government of Narendra Modi has vowed to clean up the Ganges. But the discovery of so many bodies in one place has intensified environmental and health concerns.

Hindus bathe in the Ganges as an act of ritual purification, but the 1,600-mile river flowing from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal is full of sewage and industrial waste and increasingly suffers from water shortages.

An activist said damming - including in the upper reaches of the Ganges basin - meant there was not enough water to flush the bodies downstream and help with their breakdown.

'The problem is that there is not enough river flow that is being maintained for the Ganga river,' said Mallika Bhanot of the nonprofit Ganga Ahvaan, which is working to preserve the river.

'These traditions (of placing the dead in the river) are actually becoming a health hazard with the dead bodies rotting instead of flowing off in the river,' she told CNN-IBN news channel.

'Earlier it used to flow into the river and the fishes and everything used to feed on it and it was something that was going (on) harmoniously (with nature).'

Villagers first noticed the bodies on Tuesday, when many had become stuck on a river bank with dogs and vultures circling the area.

A local official earlier reported that 80 bodies have so far been retrieved but warned the figure wwould rise.

'There could be around 100 bodies but we are yet to get an exact number,' district magistrate Saumya Agarwal told AFP by phone from Unnao district.

'It seems that as the water level has receded in the river, these bodies have surfaced.'

'We are trying to figure out the reason. We have sent a team of doctors on the spot to collect the samples from bodies to investigate the case,' she added.

The narrow river breaks off from the Ganges just before passing Pariyar, about 17 miles from the state capital of Lucknow.

'It seems these were in water for very long,' police officer Ram Chander Sahu said.
