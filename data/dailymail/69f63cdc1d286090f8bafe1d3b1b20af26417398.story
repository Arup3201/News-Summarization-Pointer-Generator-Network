Captured: A solider, his face obscured for legal reasons, guards an Iraqi

Taxpayers face a bill of more than £31million for the public inquiry focused on false allegations that British troops murdered Iraqi prisoners of war and mutilated their bodies.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond yesterday disclosed the enlarged estimate of the cost of the controversial Al-Sweady inquiry.

It came seven weeks after lawyers representing Iraqi families withdrew their central claim that soldiers had killed unarmed civilians.

At that stage, the cost was given officially at £23million, but Mr Hammond said in a Parliamentary answer that it was now expected to reach £31.1million – more than four times the figure for the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war itself.

Almost a quarter of the overall figure is for barristers’ and other legal fees, with £2.8million going to Birmingham solicitor Phil Shiner’s Public Interest Lawyers.

The firm represented Iraqi detainees and their families, some of whose evidence was discredited and said to have been ‘fabricated’.

Last night Iraq veteran Colonel Tim Collins, whose Royal Irish troops played a pivotal role in capturing Basra, condemned the action.

‘It is right and proper that the British Army is held to high standards, but the allegations that have been brought are tenuous at best,’ he said. ‘It is an abuse of the system. The only losers are justice and the taxpayer.’

The collapse of the central claims at the inquiry will focus new scrutiny on the cases of more than 1,500 Iraqis who claim they are the victims of British abuse and who are being represented by PIL.

Many of the cases are understood to be paid for by the taxpayer.

No breakdown of the latest estimate given by Mr Hammond is available, but figures released at the end of April showed the cost was £23,149,476, with the largest bill – £7,077,422 – being for investigative and other expert services.

Investigators, including 12 former Scotland Yard detectives, were paid as much as £1,000 a day to probe the unfounded allegations.

They travelled on business class flights, staying in five-star hotels in the Middle East, so they could interview potential witnesses. Barristers’ and other legal costs were £5,131,108.

It is ten years today since the firefight – known as the Battle of Danny Boy after a British checkpoint near Majar al-Kabir, north of Basra – that sparked the allegations at the centre of the Al-Sweady inquiry. It took its name from Hameed Al-Sweady, 19, an Iraqi allegedly killed by British troops.

Around 100 insurgents ambushed a patrol of British soldiers and during a three-hour battle 28 Iraqis were said to have been killed and several soldiers injured, none fatally.

It led to claims that 20 or more Iraqis taken prisoner during the battle were murdered and their bodies mutilated, and that nine others were tortured.

But the case made to the inquiry sensationally fell apart when lawyers for the Iraqis admitted there was no evidence in the central claim – that insurgents were murdered and their bodies mutilated.

It provoked outrage that British troops were accused of the most serious crimes by publicly-funded lawyers.

Lawyers for the troops and Ministry of Defence said accusations of war crimes were ‘manifestly untrue’.

Iraqi witnesses ‘dishonestly’ fabricated claims because of an ‘ulterior motive in the form of financial compensation’, they claimed.

But lawyers for the Iraqis said there were still numerous ‘grave’ claims of abuse to consider.

The inquiry is also looking at allegations of abuse, torture and mistreatment of the nine Iraqis by UK forces.

After sitting for more than 42 weeks it has finished hearing evidence and is expected to report by the end of the year.

A spokesman for the inquiry said it is ‘focused on obtaining value for money’. She added: ‘It was the investigators doing such an extensive job that led to these claims being withdrawn.’
