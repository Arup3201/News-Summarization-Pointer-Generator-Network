She has vowed to shrink her fashion empire despite enjoying a recent surge in profits.

Dame Vivienne Westwood, 72, has said she will integrate her environmental beliefs with her business ethics by reducing her contribution to mass production - something which she says is directly linked with climate change.

'Do I feel guilty about all the 
consumption that the fashion world promotes? Well, I can answer that by 
saying that I am now trying to make my own business more efficient and 
self-sustaining,' she says.

Vivienne Westwood, who enjoyed a surge in profits, has said she will not expand - she will do the opposite

Westwood believes she will now be able to use her label to champion 
her politics more authentically.

The high-fashion designer from 
Derbyshire said she wants to nurture and improve what her company already does rather than increase it, 
despite recent success in China and the US. She also made a £5m profit in 2012 - significantly up on the previous year.

'I have decided not to expand any more. 
In fact I want to do the opposite,' she told the Observer. 'I am now 
more interested in quality rather than quantity.'

In similar fashion, she is joining forces with Greenpeace for a new campaign to Save The Arctic.

A T-shirt emblazoned with a heart-shaped printed design promoting the charity's efforts is modelled by an array of supermodels, musicians and Hollywood stars in the new photo-campaign.

George Clooney, Jerry Hall and daughter Georgia May Jagger, singers Paloma Faith and Chris Martin and Westwood herself feature in the new set of images by award-winning celebrity photographer Andy Gotts MBE.

He says: 'People want to support Vivienne Westwood. She’s so passionate. They see Vivienne as someone really special and people feel the urge to fight in her corner.'

The stunning portraits for Greenpeace also feature Monty Python's Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam, as well 
as the actress Saffron Burrows.

'What I want people to be able to do is to buy well, by first choosing well and then making it last.

'And I also believe that if everyone wore just a few beautiful things, there would not be such a climate change problem.

'People don't realise how quickly we are marching towards a possible mass extinction. Once the global temperature goes up beyond two degrees, you can't stop it. Current predictions are that we will see a rise of more like 4C or 6C, which would mean that everything below Paris would become uninhabitable.'
