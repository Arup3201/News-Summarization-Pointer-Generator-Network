Dyfed Powys Police are calling off the search for missing April Jones next month after a six-month police operation proved fruitless

The search for the body of missing April Jones will finish next month after the biggest police search operation the UK has ever seen.

Five-year-old April Jones disappeared from the housing estate where she lived in Machynlleth, mid Wales, on October 1.

Since then six-month search involving a methodical examination of thousands of acres of rugged terrain around the town has continued unabated.

Bad weather has forced specialist search teams to cancel the on-going search operation this week.

Search teams of more than 130 people are due to rest over the Easter break as the six month anniversary of April's abduction approaches.

Now Dyfed Powys Police have announced that the search operation will be concluded by the end of next month.

A reactive team of search officers will remain on duty ready to respond to any new information which may emerge.

More than 23 square miles and 300 separate locations have been searched during the six-month operation.

‘The terrain is extremely challenging.

The mountains, gorges, streams and waterfalls in the area mean extra care has to be taken and specialist safety equipment has to be worn,’ a Dyfed Powys Police spokesman said today.

‘The force made a commitment to search until all viable lines of inquiry were complete.’

Police divers searched the river Dyfi in Ceinws, Mid Wales, for the body of April Jones, who went missing on October 1 2012

He added: ‘The teams have worked through a
detailed plan that was based on information from the investigation, and
national best practice guidance.

Mark Bridger, has been charged with abducting and murdering five-year-old April Jones and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice

‘Throughout the search a range of 
specialist resources have been used from various agencies including 
police marine units, experts in searching confined spaces and mines, 
fire and rescue urban search and rescue teams, the coastguard and 
mountain rescue teams as well as specially trained CSI dogs from all 
over the UK.’

He said: ‘There is no searching taking place this week due to inclement weather and there will be no searching carried out over Easter.

‘During April officers will be searching specific areas of land with a view to all search areas identified being completed by the end of April.

‘There will of course remain a reactive team of specialist officers available to respond to any new information that is received.’

Local man Mark Bridger, 47, was arrested the day after April's abduction.

He was later charged with abduction and murder and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

He is scheduled to stand trial at Mold Crown Court on April 29.
