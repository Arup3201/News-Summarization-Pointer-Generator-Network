Comedians The Bondi Hipsters thought they'd caught Tony Abbott out 'buying' Facebook friends when a graph was released showing most of his 395,000 followers were based in the Indian capital of New Delhi.

'Hey Tony brah... Hahve [sic] you been buying Facebook likes?... Either thaht of you're really popular with 18-34 year olds from New Delhi,' they wrote on Facebook, in a comment that soon triggered a torrent of debate on the internet.

In just the last week, the number of followers of Mr Abbott increased by a staggering 15 per cent - dwarfing any other political figure in Australia. This came at a time when the Prime Minister was struggling in the polls.

Comedians The Bondi Hipsters questioned the Prime Minister's surge in popularity on their Facebook page

Tony Abbott's rise in popularity was because Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted a 'selfie' with  the Prime Minister on his  Facebook page - which triggered more than 700,000 likes and saw Abbott's followers jump 15 percent

But Liberal Party supporters were quick to jump to the defence of their leader, pointing out that his increase in fans from India appeared to be because of a series of posts with the  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has more than 25 million fans on his Facebook.

Mr Modi posted a 'selfie' of the pair at the Melbourne Cricket Ground last Tuesday, along with a caption: 'With my friend Tony Abbott at the MCG' and has received more than 700,000 'likes'.

BuzzFeed reported that on the same day, Abbott's page 'exploded' with likes, especially from young people from New Delhi, with the most popular age group ranging between 18 to 34 year olds.

But it didn't stop there, Modi also posted other pictures of himself and his pal Mr Abbott on the same day, with captions like: 'I feel my friendship with Tony Abbott will further strengthen India-Australia ties in the years to come'.

A spokesman for Mr Abbott told BuzzFeed News that his office has not purchased any likes but it comes after the world leaders attended the G20 summit in Brisbane, which was hosted by the PM.

'It is no secret that the Prime Minister hosted a number of world leaders in recent times, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi,' the spokesman told BuzzFeed.

'These visits attracted large international audiences to the Prime Minister's social media channels, thus generating a spike in organic engagement with the page.'
