Carrying shopping, work kit or even an order of pizzas on a motorbike can be tricky, unless you have access to a massive Harley Davidson.

But an eco-friendly electric bike that has a large cubby hole instead of a fuel tank could mean the end of cumbersome backpacks or bags precariously balanced on handlebars.

German engineers built a nifty electric motor into the hub of the ‘Feddz’ bike’s wheel to free up the space for a rider’s personal possessions.

The future of pizza delivery? An eco-friendly electric bike (pictured) that has a large cubby hole instead of a fuel tank could mean the end of cumbersome backpacks or bags precariously balanced on handlebars

USP: The bike has a large cubby hole where the fuel tank and engine would be on a traditional motorbike.

Power: An electric motor is built into the hub of the bike's wheel.

Charging: The bike can be charged using a standard household power outlet and take around seven hours for a full charge.

Batteries: The bikes use the latest lithium-ion batteries.

Storage: The cubby hole can accommodate 23 litres - or a tool box, collection of logs or several pizza boxes.

Range: The premium model has a range of 68miles (110km) and the eco one a smaller range of 43miles (70km).

Top speed: The premium bike can reach 28mph (45kph) and the eco model has a capped speed of 16mph (25kph).

Weight: 99lbs (45kg) - including the battery.

Price: €5,990 (£5,018) for the eco model and $6,990 (£5,855) for the premium bike.

The Feddz model is designed and built by a German firm called Emo-Bike and its most eye-catching feature is the cavity where you expect an engine and fuel tank to be, which is freed up as 23litres of storage space – enough for logs, pizzas or a large toolbox, according to the company.

The 'cargo space' is fitted with two belts with ‘quick release closures’ and inside the frame is a USB connection so that riders can charge their smartphones on the go.

The bikes are available with two different batteries.

The ‘premium’ bike with the larger battery has a 68-mile (110km) range on a seven hour charge and a top speed of 28mph (45kph).

The ‘eco model’ has a range of 43miles 
(70km) has a capped speed of 16mph (25kph) which means it can be driven 
without a licence in some places.

According to Emo-Bike, the ‘plug-in and drive’ batteries use the newest lithium-ion technology and can be recharged using any household outlet while they are removed from the bike, or still attached.

The bike frame and wheels weigh just 73lbs (33kg) and can be loaded onto a conventional bike carrier once the 25lb (12kg) battery is removed.

Seat height can be adjusted to allow a rider to choose between a comfortable upright position and a lower, sportier posture.

The most basic model costs €5,990 (£5,018) and while it is an investment, the company points out that a user will save money on fuel in the long-run.
