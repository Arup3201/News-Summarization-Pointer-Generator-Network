A man has appeared on This Morning to tell of his horror after finding himself with a single B-cup breast.

Farshad Hashemzadeh, 28, was left so distressed by the unwanted appendage, he attempted to slice it off himself after being denied surgery by the NHS.

The car parts salesman, who has since had it removed privately, told hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that he was left desperately unhappy after surgery was repeatedly refused.

Traumatised: Farshad Hashemzadeh appeared on This Morning to discuss his feelings about growing a breast

As it was: Farshad Hashemzadeh was so distressed by his unwanted breast, he tried to slice it off himself

'I went to the GP and started using tablets,' he revealed of early attempts to get rid of the breast which began growing shortly after he turned 18.

'It got rid it for two months but it started growing back. It wasn't that hard when I was 18 but [by the age of] 25, I really started suffering because I couldn't have a relationship.

'In the summer I would put two or three vests on and try to hide it with my hand.'

Farshad's condition, although rare, is not unique with around 400 men diagnosed with gynaecomastia each year.

The condition, which is caused by a hormone imbalance, is more commonly found in the over-50s but rarely manifests in such an extreme way.

'It's surprisingly common, particularly 
with men over 50,' added This Morning's resident GP, Dr Jonty Heaversedge.

Difficulties: Farshad and his girlfriend Charlene had to raise £3000 for a private operation after the NHS refused

'Often it arises in adolescence and it can also be a 
complication of medication - 20 percent of those who get gynaecomastia, get it as side 
effect.'

Although the NHS will look at funding surgery for people suffering from similar conditions, Farshad, despite his continuing distress, was repeatedly refused surgery.

'Most people do hide it,' added Dr Heaversedge, 'but you can't underestimate the effect on people's self-confidence and their relationships.'

In Farshad's case, his anger and upset eventually resulted in a dramatic attempt to cut the breast away himself.

'I was very angry by the decision of the NHS and I couldn't see any way out,' he told the Sun newspaper.

Common: According to Dr Jonty Heaversedge, the condition tends to arise in men over the age of 50

Healing: Farshad's breast following the operation to remove it. He hopes it won't grow back

'I was too embarrassed to take my top off in front of my girlfriend so I tried to cut it away.

'It was painful and there was blood all over the floor. But even then, the NHS couldn't see how distressed I was.'

Girlfriend Charlene Cullen, 30, who appeared alongside him on This Morning, added: 'He was really embarrassed and took a month before he would tell me what was wrong.

'It didn't bother me but it did bother him and made him very self conscious. I went to his GP and they wouldn't do anything.'

She decided to help him raise the £3000 it would cost to have the breast removed privately and last month, Farshad finally went under the knife.

'There's nothing in there anymore,' he reveals. 'I was awake during the operation because I wanted to believe I was getting rid of it after two years [of dealing with the trauma of it].'

Now the breast is gone, Farshad says he finally feels happy again and says once the scar has properly healed, he will really start feeling 'like a man' again.

He added: 'I only hope it doesn't come back.'
