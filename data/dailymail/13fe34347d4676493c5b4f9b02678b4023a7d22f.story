England went back to work on Friday at Adelaide’s St Peter’s College, alma mater of 10 Australian Prime Ministers and one of the country’s great schools, but there was no way they could relax and enjoy the splendour of their surroundings.

Elimination at the group stages of this World Cup is just one slip-up or even one rainy day away for England, who seem to have been wading through treacle while the rest of the world have been playing a different, far more vibrant, one-day game.

Now England must beat Bangladesh and Afghanistan in their final Group A games and hope New Zealand also defeat Bangladesh, while keeping their fingers crossed that the elements do not intervene.

Jos Buttler has warned England that they cannot afford any more slip-ups  if they are to avoid elimination

India sealed a place in the World Cup knockout stages after a nervy run chase against West Indies in Perth.

The defending champions bowled West Indies out for 182 in 44.2 overs, captain Jason Holder top-scoring with 57 at No 9. India’s task was made harder by an up-and-down wicket at the WACA, but 45 not out from MS Dhoni saw them reach their target with four wickets and 10.5 overs to spare.

‘It was a difficult wicket, with variable bounce,’ said Dhoni. ‘Overall, I was very happy with the performance.’

England have endured some rotten World Cups but to go out in the first round of a competition designed to guarantee progress for the big eight would make this the worst yet. But the way they have been playing, not even victory against the two minnows can be taken for granted.

Defeat by Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval on Monday would pile pressure on coach Peter Moores and Paul Downton, who appointed him, when a new broom is sweeping through the ECB.

To think that the Ashes were moved and we had to endure a 5-0 thrashing so that this team could have unprecedented one-day preparation for a World Cup.

There was a subdued air on Friday with only the St Peter’s pupils chosen to supplement the fielders during middle practice having a spring in their step.

England were criticised for changing their line-up on the eve of this World Cup but they would be stubborn in the extreme if they did not shuffle their pack now.

Trouble is, Alex Hales looked in terrible touch both in the middle against England’s bowlers and later in a net.

Meanwhile, Ravi Bopara cut a forlorn figure as he faced some of the worst net bowling imaginable from the enthusiastic locals and England can only hope that both contenders for Gary Ballance’s place fare much better in practice over the weekend.

At least Eoin Morgan looked terrific when he batted.

‘It’s not the greatest,’ admitted Jos Buttler when asked how the mood was. ‘But we are determined to change that round. In simple terms we have to play much better to get to the quarter-finals. We have to play well and win two games of cricket.’ Buttler is one of the few players capable of making the sort of impact we have seen from AB de Villiers, Brendon McCullum and Chris Gayle but he has been held back by a far too conservative England.

The fact that he received only 19 balls against Sri Lanka in Wellington perhaps said it all and the new one-day vice-captain accepted that England need to have a look at a batting order that seems to have been set in stone.

‘I think we have to be flexible to different situations,’ said Buttler. ‘If we get off to a good start then maybe guys could go up the order and look to take it on a bit more. Whatever we do we have to post big scores and do it consistently.’

England’s bowlers are under just as much pressure as the batsmen after the way Sri Lanka cruised home in Wellington and it would be no surprise if James Tredwell, who had a long bowl on Friday, comes in against Bangladesh.
