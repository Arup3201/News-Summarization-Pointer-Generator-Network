A teenager with terminal cancer who penned a farewell song to his friends and family that became an internet hit has passed away after a four-year battle.

Zach Sobiech, 18, from Minnesota, died on Monday morning surrounded by relatives and loved ones.

His death comes six months after he released a song, 'Clouds', which he wrote after learning that he was fighting a losing battle against a rare bone cancer and had just months to live.

The catchy tune was such a hit that celebrities including Rachel Bilson, Ashley Tisdale and Jason Mraz teamed together this month to produce a version of them lip-synching the song for his birthday.

Saying goodbye: Zach Sobiech, who penned a song about his experience with a rare terminal bone cancer,  passed away on Monday morning at the age of 18. He was surrounded by friends and family

Zach was just 14 when he diagnosed with osteosarcoma in 2009 and led to numerous surgeries and chemotherapy treatments. In 2012, doctors discovered the illness had spread to his pelvis and lungs.

When he was faced with the decision of losing one of his legs and half his pelvis to momentarily stall the illness, his family agreed they should put his quality of life first, and forewent the treatment.

With doctors telling him he had just months to live, last year he recorded a farewell song entitled 'Clouds' to say thank you to family and friends.

After posting the video to YouTube in December, it quickly spread across the internet, and has now been watched nearly three million times, even gaining a celebrity following.

Upbeat: Shortly before his death, he also featured in a documentary entitled 'My Last Days', pictured

The
 gentle, acoustic melody features Zach on the guitar and the lyrics to 
the tune express his appreciation for the time he does have.

'And
 we'll go up, up, up/ But I'll fly a little higher/ We'll go up in the 
clouds/ because the view is a little nicer,' the lyrics read.

Last year the family set up the Zach Sobiech Osteosarcoma Fund to raise money for the Children’s Cancer Research Fund. All proceeds from digital downloads of his song goes towards the charity.

After the popularity of the song, record label BMI flew Zach and his family to New York to sign a record deal - and it also caught the attention of some famous faces.

Helping out: The touching video also starred Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad, pictured

Earlier this month, dozens of celebrities, including Jason Mraz, Anna Faris, Rachel Bilson and Ashley Tisdale, joined forces to make a response, lip-synching his words.

Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad, comedian Sarah Silverman, The Hangover's Ed Helms, and folk band the Lumiereers also make appearances in the video.

Zach also featured in a documentary directed by Justin Baldoni for a reality series, 'My Last Days'.

In the opening scenes, Zach says to the camera: 'I want everyone to know: You don’t have to find out you’re dying to start living.'

Baldoni told CNN: 'Going out to see 
Zach in Minnesota was one of the greatest experiences of my life... He 
is this old soul who inspires everyone he meets. You leave and you 
think: "I want to be a better person".'

Loved: His parents, who have praised Zach's positivity and talent, also featured in the latest video

Fans: Zach has used his time to perform his song for others and raise money for cancer research

Zach's mother Laura told CNN that her son slept a lot in his final days but still tried to muster enough energy to play the guitar and laugh with his friends and family.

'That's what Zach's always been really good at: recognizing what is good and being grateful for it,' she said. 'It's the first thing he seeks out, his starting point. He taught all of us how it's done.'

Last year, he explained to CBS: 'With my situation you don't have 
time to be sad or angry or anything. You have to just go because you 
don't have that much time.'
