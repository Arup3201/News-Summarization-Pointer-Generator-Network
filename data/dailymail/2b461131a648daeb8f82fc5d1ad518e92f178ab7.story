The Tour De France may have encouraged hundreds of people to get out on their bikes, but whether you’re a professional or an amateur, no cyclist can escape the scourge of punctured tyres.

Fed up with lengthy and expensive repairs, a team of bike enthusiasts developed a tool that fixes punctures permanently, in just 60 seconds.

Called patchnride, the tool can also locate exactly where a puncture is using a so-called leak detector, and the whole system costs $25 (£15).

The patchnride tool (pictured) was developed in Florida and works by fixing punctures using adhesive and a rubber seal. This takes less than 60 seconds and is said to be a permanent fix

Its designers claim this 'groundbreaking' method saves money and time as cyclists don't have to replace the tyre. 

When a cyclist suffers a damaged tyre, they locate the puncture using the patchnride leak detector.

This tool causes bubbles to form at the site of the leak when the tool is inserted into the rim. 

After removing debris, such as a nail, pin or thorn, using one end of the tool, the cyclist pinches the tyre and inserts the other end into the puncture.

Hitting the start button releases adhesive and pushes the slider on the tool forward so it inserts the patch into the tyre.

After removing the tool, a rubber seal is left, which signals the repair is complete. 

Patchnride works on holes up to 0.1 inch (3mm) wide and is available for pre-order. 

It costs $25 (£15) and is expected to go on sale in September. 

Packs include two repair pods, two leak detectors and the tool itself. 

International shipping adds $5 (£3) to the cost. 

The lightweight patchnride, which weighs 0.2lbs (100g) and is five inches (12.7 cm) long, was designed by Austrian-born Alexander Deiser, although his company is based in Florida.

Keen cyclist and co-founder of patchnride, Deiser, 47, said he gets 12 flat tyres a year.

‘Nothing deflates the joy of bike riding or ruins your race quicker than a flat tyre,’ explained Mr Deiser.

‘I had ridden 264 miles in a 12-hour race, was in the lead, and then suddenly I got a flat tyre.

‘I lost the lead, and subsequently lost first place because I had to stop and change the tyre - it was incredibly frustrating.

‘This is what inspired me to look for a solution to permanently repair tyres on the go, no matter where you are and under any condition without being a sealant.

‘It has been really exciting, having created something that has never existed before and that solves a problem that many people encounter.

‘For the first time all inner tube tyres can be repaired permanently and effortlessly without the need to take off the wheel.’

Mr Deiser claims the tool cuts repair time from 10 minutes, on average, to 60 seconds and is the first product of its kind on the market.

He added: ‘Although there are glues, gels, or sealants, none of these can permanently repair a tyre like our product can.

‘Since you no longer have to take the tyre off the wheel, it really saves on time and we think it is quite revolutionary.
