Silas Richardson, 84, is accused of stabbing to death his 87-year-old brother

Authorities say an 84-year-old Maryland man has been charged with fatally stabbing his older brother.

Cecil County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. Michael Holmes says deputies found the body of 87-year-old George Carlton Richardson Sr. on Monday night.

Holmes says the body was in the backyard of the Conowingo home of Silas D. Richardson.

Deputies say Silas Richardson went to his brother's home Monday in Neptune Township, New Jersey, and told the man's girlfriend that George Richardson had died but he gave no details. 

The girlfriend said became suspicious when she saw Silas driving his older brother's car because he never allowed anyone to drive the vehicle, reports WBAL. 

Deputies then went to Silas' home to check things out.

They reportedly detected a strong smell of bleach and found blood inside the home. 

Police soon found George's body covered up in the back of Richardson's home. 

Holmes said the deceased brother had gone to the Maryland home to help out after the younger brother's wife died last week. It was unclear when he arrived.

Neptune Township police took Richardson into custody with plans to extradite him to Cecil County on first- and second-degree murder charges, robbery, theft over $10,000, reckless endangerment and assault, WBAL reports.
