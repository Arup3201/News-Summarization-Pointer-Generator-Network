A nightclub has been condemned for tweeting a photo of a 'legless' semi-naked woman sprawled out next to empty bottles.

Liquid Nightclub, in Windsor, Berkshire, posted the picture with the caption 'Want to end up like her? We're giving away a free booth to groups of girls this friday. DM [direct message] us #Mortal.'

The image shows a seemingly unconscious woman wearing just a thong and sprawled out on her front surrounded by drink bottles.

Liquid Nightclub in Windsor, Berkshire has been condemned for posting a tweet featuring a semi-naked 'legless' woman

The tweet asked revellers whether they wanted to 'end up' like the woman pictured seemingly unconscious and surrounded by empty bottles

The promotion offers a 'free booth' to a group of girls and urges people to apply by sending a direct message.

The nightclub, which says it removed the post within 40 minutes, has apologised 'unreservedly'. But the tweet has sparked anger among local councillors. 

David Hilton, Conservative member for Ascot, who is chairman of the council's crime and disorder overview and scrutiny panel, said: 'This photograph is totally alien to what the council may argue is responsible advertising or promoting responsible drinking.

'Getting legless, as this young lady appears to be, is exactly what we want to prevent because it leads to the worst kinds of crime and disorder, and young ladies getting in this state puts them at enormous personal risk.' 

The town's night-time antics, and how to police it, has become a regular feature on Royal Borough of Windsor council agendas in recent months.

Members have pressed for changes to the Licensing Act 2003 to give local authorities more flexibility in dealing with anti-social behaviour.

The club's website says booths are available for ten people for a total price of £30.

Tickets for entry to its Friday 'Audio Junk' night are on sale on the website. Today it tweeted about a which advertises £2.50 offers on some drinks and cocktails from £4.25. 

A spokesman from Liquid said: 'We apologise unreservedly for any offence caused. Liquid Windsor is a responsible operator and does not condone or promote irresponsible drinking.

'The post was unauthorised and against company policy, and it was removed within 40 minutes.

'A disciplinary investigation is now underway and we will be reviewing our social media procedures to ensure this doesn't happen again.' 

It comes after an academic report warned that a culture of heavy drinking was leading to sexual molestation becoming the norm on a night out for young women.

In a disturbing insight into how 18 to 24-year-olds behave on a night out, the survey found one in three girls received inappropriate or unwanted physical attention or groping, but few were surprised.

Academics said that excessive consumption of alcohol had turned Britain’s pubs and clubs into a ‘permissive social arena’.

The findings were revealed in a report for the charity Drinkaware, which urged women to stop tolerating behaviour which would be considered unacceptable when sober.
