The U.S. Federal Investigation Bureau released records it was keeping on celebrated journalist and late ‘60 Minutes’ correspondent Mike Wallace, who died on April 7, 2012, at the age of 93.

The files include a look into whether Wallace was involved in communist activities as well as an investigation of a threatening letter sent to him by an emotionally disturbed World War II veteran titled 'Communist Control of the Press.'

Wallace, late '60 Minutes' creator Don Hewitt and three others took a trip to Cuba in the summer of 1970  to document the country, according to the files.

The group departed from Mexico with 22 pieces of luggage weighing about 770 pounds and returned with 26 pieces of luggage weighing about 904 pounds. An educated guess would be Cuban cigars, other souvenirs or additional camera tape from the embargoed island.

Wallace, who was 52 at the time, was not discovered to be a communist member or sympathizer.

A separate investigation into a bizarre and threatening letter from April 4, 1977, identified the sender as Donald P. Hale -- a disabled World War II veteran and a former prisoner of war.

'I have solid proof that you are a pro-communist anti-American traitor,' the letter reads. 'We will expose you, convict you, and hang you.'

Hale’s letter also includes references to his dog puking on the rug and 'piddling' in Wallace's eye through the television screen.

The U.S. Attorney's office decided against prosecuting Hale for extortion, stating that his letter did not appear to have criminal intent and that Hale told investigators he meant no harm and was suffering from 'emotional problems.'

Wallace was known for his aggressive reporting style during television interviews, including interviews with other news personalities.

During his more than 60-year career in media he worked as a journalist, an actor and a game show host.

Wallace was one of the original correspondents for CBS' '60 Minutes' news program, which first aired in September 1968.

A CBS News spokesman told the network's own reporter that it was not uncommon during the days of the Cold War for the U.S. government to keep tabs on prominent journalists.

'Mike would surely get a laugh about this but he wouldn't be surprised: a journalist doing his job back then could certainly catch the attention of the FBI,' said spokesman Kevin Tedesco.

The government files on Wallace were pulled from the FBI's records vault and were requested by CBS via the U.S. Freedom of Information Act.
