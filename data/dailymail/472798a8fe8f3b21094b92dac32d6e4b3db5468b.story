The early 1900s were a time of nobility and an idyllic, non-commercial European way of life - before it was interrupted by the ravages of war.

Seized by the Nazis more than 70 years ago, these beautifully rendered travel posters have stood the test of time, depicting locations the way the artists intended them to be seen.

For those who fancy the chance to take home a piece of history, Swann Auction Galleries is offering the opportunity to own part of the Julius Paul Collection.

One of the priciest of the bunch, Henri Cassiers's advert for Red Star Line is expected to fetch up to £4,800 at an auction in New York

The majority of these posters, restituted to Mr Paul’s heirs in 2008, were created before the First World War.

Free from marketing gimmicks or stylised shoots, these adverts are reminiscent of a time when a landscape drawing was enough to encourage people to buy a ticket for a train or ocean liner.

The international collection features holiday destinations from Austria and Yugoslavia to the US and Canada, as well as vintage images of the most extravagant ocean liners and top ski resorts of the era.

From the beaches of the French Riviera to the little-known provinces of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and the spas of Central Europe, these posters are something special.

Particularly, Franz Korwan's mythical depiction of Sylt as the Queen of the North Sea, rising from the waters partially naked.

'It's an early example of the shift toward allegorical advertisement,' Nicholas Lowery, president of Swann Auction Galleries, told Forbes.

Ironically, Sylt is now a famed European beachfront, known for its nude beaches.

Franz Fiebiger's depiction of the ancient Roman city of Aquileia, from an undisclosed date, has an estimated value of £1,200 to £1,900

Travel posters from this innocent era are especially beautiful due to their breathtaking lithography.

Many of these pieces are one-of-a-kind and, due to their careful storage in a custom oak cabinet , are also in fantastic condition. 

Even though the collection was expropriated and liquidated by Nazis in 1939, they were resold to Vienna's Albertina Museum, where they were housed until 2008.

It was then that the Austrian government returned the posters to their rightful heir.

The intricate illustrations will be auctioned off in New York on December 17.
