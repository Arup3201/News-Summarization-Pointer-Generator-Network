Jailed: David Bell, 26, beat his wife and kept her in the loft for three weeks

An evil bodybuilder has been jailed after he kept his starving wife and baby prisoner in a filthy loft and forced her to have sex with strangers.

David Bell, 26, beat his wife Zara with saucepans and martial arts weapons - and kept her in the attic of the family home with their daughter Jessica, one.

Zara, 26, only managed to escape her life of 
terror in Pitsea, Essex, when she smuggled an old mobile phone into the loft and called 
police while her husband was out.

She barely had enough food to feed her daughter and the pair had to sit in the attic, 
soaked in their own urine.

After police rescued her doctors discovered she had 24 separate injuries.

She had been kept there over a three-week period while Bell trained for hours on end at the gym.

A recording of her call was played to the hushed court room.

'I have been abused by my husband,' she told the operator. 'I am sitting in the loft and I can't get out.'

Bell was jailed for nine years at Basildon Crown Court after he admitted false imprisonment and causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

He showed no remorse as he was given a public protection sentence. He will only be released if he can prove he is not a danger to the public.

His wife has since moved out of the area.

Bell repeatedly attacked her with kitchen saucepans, nunchaku - martial arts fighting sticks - and even a metal sieve.

After one beating, the court was told he forced Zara to stand in front of a mirror and sneered: 'I don't 
suppose you recognise yourself do you?'

Andrew Jackson, prosecuting, said: 'In 
the first day of her police interview she said "he's always stamping on 
me". It isn't going too far to say she is frightened to death of this 
defendant.'

Bell refused to answer questions from detectives during interview.

Prisoner: David Bell kept his wife and one-year-old daughter holed up inside the loft in the family home in this street in Pitsea, Essex

Mr Jackson said events took a 
sinister turn when Bell told his wife he wanted her to sleep with a 
stranger to 'spice up their boring sex life'.

In
February this year he arranged for his wife to meet a man in a Basildon
pub and bought a video camera for his wife to film the encounter.

Terrified
that her husband would harm her even more and fearing for her 
daughter's safety she went through with the encounter after drinking a 
bottle of Vodka.

When her husband watched the video back he was so jealous and enraged he began his campaign of torture the next day.

For
three weeks he repeatedly battered his wife and, each time he went to 
the gym, Bell locked his wife and their baby daughter in the loft.

During one of the horrific beatings, Bell punched his wife in the face, breaking her nose.

But he refused to take her to hospital and made her reset her own nose, before beating her again an hour later.

Mr Jackson said: 'He subjected his wife, on a daily basis, to what we say was savage and sustained beatings using his fists, feet and weapons.

'During that period the prosecution say he subjected Zara Bell to utter humiliation.

'Effectively, he tortured her.'

She was eventually rescued on February 22 after dialling 999 on an old mobile phone that she had smuggled into the loft.

Police Constable Mark Hurd said in a statement that he had never seen injuries as bad.

Maria Dineen, defending Bell, said: 'Ever 
since the moment of his arrest he has been truly horrified and ashamed 
at his action and the physical and emotional scars they have left on his
wife.'

The mother-of-one lost her job at a bakery because she came in to work covered in bruises so often that her employers felt she put off customers.

As he jailed Bell, Judge Jonathan Black said: 'An experienced police officer stated at the time that the injuries he saw were by far the worst he had ever seen.'

Speaking after her husband was locked up for beating and falsely imprisoning her, Zara Bell said: 'I'm terrified of him. 'For what he's done to me, I hope he rots in prison.

'I've got to restart my whole life. He destroyed my life. I've had to move away and have been isolated from my family and friends.

'But I've got to make a new life for my daughter and I.'

Zara's friends and family wept in the
public gallery as they heard her make the desperate call to police 
while Bell was at the gym.

She is heard on the recording 
becoming increasingly frantic, as the sounds of music from her 
daughter's toy could be eerily heard in the background.

Police operator: Hello police

Zara: My name is Zara Bell. I have been abused by my husband. I am sitting in the loft and I can't get out. (Begins to cry.) My daughter is with me.

Police operator: Are you both in the loft?

Zara: My husband is quite well-built. He is going to come back any minute. For the last few weeks I've been hurt by him, my face is black and blue. This was the first time I could get the phone, it took me a few days to get it.

Police operator: Okay, stay calm, I've got a police car on its way to you.

Zara: Will they be able to get in? I'm in the loft.

Police operator: Can you get out of the loft?

Zara: I can't get down, the ladders, he's got them out on the balcony. He puts me up here first and then he takes the ladders away. I found this phone when I was cleaning but it took me a few days to find where the phone charger was.

Police operator: The police have arrived but stay with me until the officers get to you. (Zara begins heavily crying as she hears the police kick the door down and most of what she says from this point is inaudible.)
