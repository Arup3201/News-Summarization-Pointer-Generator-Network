Former England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones has joined Gloucestershire on a two-year deal.

Jones enjoyed a successful loan spell at Gloucestershire last season, playing in three LV= County Championship and two NatWest T20 Blast matches, scoring 186 runs.

The highlight of his brief spell at the County Ground in Bristol was a knock of 93 in the nine-wicket County Championship Division Two victory against Leicestershire in June.

Jones, who left Kent in the summer after 14 seasons with the county, will skipper Gloucestershire in first-class matches as they attempt to gain promotion to Division One next year.

Geraint Jones thanked Kent County Cricket Club for the 'fantastic 15 seasons' he spent with them 

Gloucestershire director of cricket John Bracewell said: 'With Michael Klinger not re-joining us until June next year, Geraint will captain the team in four-day cricket for the 2015 season. We have spoken to Michael about that and he is comfortable with it.

'We intend using Geraint as a batsman and his presence on the field will be invaluable in offering advice and assistance to our young bowling attack.'

Jones added: 'Firstly, I'd like to thank Kent County Cricket Club for the fantastic 15 seasons I spent with them. I learnt a huge amount there and without the opportunities they gave me I never would have had the career that I have.

'Following an enjoyable month on loan with Gloucestershire during 2014, I am excited to be joining the Club on a full-time basis and for the challenges that lie ahead.

His 34 England Tests yielded 1,172 runs, including one century and six fifties, 128 catches and five stumpings

'They have a great set up here and I am looking forward to taking on the role as four-day captain and to working in tandem with Michael Klinger. This is a young and talented squad and I relish the opportunity of working with them and to playing a part in their future development.

'I also look forward to working with John Bracewell and his coaching team. They impressed me greatly during my loan period so the chance to work full time with them I know will have big benefits.'

Jones made his Test debut against the West Indies in 2004 and was part of the England side that reclaimed the Ashes in thrilling fashion a year later. His 34 Tests yielded 1,172 runs, including one century and six fifties, 128 catches and five stumpings.

The 38-year-old has also played 49 one-day internationals for England and has represented Papua New Guinea, the country of his birth, in recent years.

Jones has scored 8,615 runs in 193 first-class cricket matches at an average of 32.5, with 15 centuries and 46 fifties. He has also taken 586 catches and made 36 stumpings.
