Justice Secretary Chris Grayling vowed to ¿slay the health and safety culture¿

Employees who hurt themselves doing ‘something dumb’ at work will no longer win compensation if bosses have taken steps to keep them safe.

Under tough new laws, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling vowed to ‘slay the health and safety culture’ which had sparked a wave of legal claims for big payouts.

He warned society had become ‘too inclined to blame someone else’ when things go wrong, pledging to make it harder for ambulance-chasing lawyers to win cases in court.

Fear of being sued dissuades small businesses from hiring extra staff and schools have reined in the number and type of trips they take pupils on over concerns they could face legal action if trouble arises – even when they have taken reasonable safety steps.

In a case last year, Norfolk policewoman Kelly Jones threatened to sue a garage boss after tripping over a 6in kerb while answering a midnight call.

She dropped the case following a public outcry and criticism from her own chief constable.

Mr Grayling’s Social Action, Responsibility and Heroism Bill will be debated by MPs for the first time today.

He is determined to turn the tide on the compensation culture which costs businesses, charities and local authorities millions and boosts insurance premiums.

‘This is a Bill that’s out to try and slay the health and safety culture,’ he said. 

‘It is about trying to restore common sense to the kind of situations which happen all too often and very seldom get to court – where somebody has an accident at work, it’s entirely their own fault, they have got a perfectly responsible employer who has the normal health and safety procedures in place but that person does something dumb …  and sues the employer anyway.’

The Bill means a court deciding a negligence case will have to consider whether the defendant was acting for the benefit of society, such as running an event or clearing snow from a path.

Judges will also have to weigh up whether a person facing a compensation claim had demonstrated a ‘generally responsible’ approach to safety.

Mr Grayling added: ‘I want a society where common sense is the order of the day, not one where responsible employers are prevented from growing their businesses for constant fear of being sued for slips and trips if something goes wrong … If someone has acted responsibly to protect the safety of others … the law will be on their side.’ 

The Bill was applauded by voluntary groups who have warned that fear of litigation stops many people from offering their services.

But unions said it raised concerns about the potential impact on employees injured at work.
