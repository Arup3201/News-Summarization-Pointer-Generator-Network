From Himalayan pink salt to quinoa, it seems the trendiest groceries are no longer just for our kitchens but also for our bathrooms, as high-end beauty brands try to convince us that swanky superfoods can benefit us from the outside-in, as well the inside-out.

But at such extortionate prices, could you make your own beauty products from these foods — and would they be any good?

Using recipes from reputable websites, ANNA PURSGLOVE gave it a go, and asked leading dermatologists Dr Sam Bunting and Dr Stefanie Williams for their verdicts . . .

Anna Pursglove finds out if you can make your own beauty products from these foods — and whether they would be any good

HIMALAYAN PINK SALT

Beloved by celebrity chefs such as Jamie Oliver, pink salt is mined in Pakistan and its pink colour comes from iron oxide.

Now, fashionable brands such as Milanese company Pupa are using it in their body scrubs, with devotees claiming it stimulates circulation, reduces inflammation and can help with bloating. But could I get the same results for less than the £42 it would cost me to buy Pupa’s Reshaping Salt Scrub?

Recipe: For a Himalayan pink salt scrub, mix two parts Himalayan pink salt (around £4 for 500g from healthfood stores), one part almond oil (around £5 for 200ml from healthfood stores), lemon zest and fresh thyme leaves.

Verdict: This scrub left my skin feeling fresh, stimulated and nicely moisturised. My friends will know what to expect for Christmas!

Dr Williams says: ‘There is no scientific evidence that using pink salt topically can achieve any kind of “detox” for your skin. Mixed with oil and used as a scrub, it will exfoliate — but I wouldn’t anticipate any benefits other than that.’

QUINOA

Anna tries an orange moisturising face mask with quinoa which is hailed as a supergrain, buttechnically a seed

Hailed as a supergrain, quinoa is technically a seed. It comes in three forms — red, white and black — and is high in protein, a source of zinc, magnesium, manganese and iron, and free of gluten (so it’s good for coeliacs).

Now, it has popped up in a moisturiser by British brand Cowshed. Their Quinoa Hydrating Daily Moisturiser costs £32 and claims to be packed with vitamins and minerals to hydrate your skin. I decided to try out a quinoa face mask.

Recipe: Combine a handful of quinoa (around £2 for 300g from supermarkets) with the juice of an orange, three tablespoons of natural yoghurt and two tablespoons of honey.

Stir until blended and thick enough to apply to your face. Leave for 15 minutes, then rinse with warm water.

Verdict: Disaster! Use too much yoghurt and the stuff runs off your face, but use too little and the quinoa soaks up the yoghurt, leaving the consistency of concrete. By the time I’d got the stuff to stick to my face, I had clumps of quinoa up my nose and a kitchen and bathroom that looked as though they’d been pebble-dashed!

Dr Bunting says: ‘While you might get minimal exfoliating effect from rubbing quinoa against your skin, I have not seen any data that shows your skin would receive significant benefit from applying quinoa in a homemade preparation.’

AVOCADO

Full of healthy fats and potassium, avocado isn’t the newest of health foods, but it’s a firm favourite. Due to its high oleic acid content (a fatty acid said to make hair thicker and shinier) it’s found in many conditioning hair products by brands such as Tresemme and Pantene, as well as in Kiehl’s Olive & Avocado Leave-In Oil-In-Cream, £19. DIY beauty fans recommend avocado treatments for dry, brittle hair because of its high vitamin and oil content.

Recipe: For an avocado hair conditioner, mix one avocado (around £1), two tablespoons of honey and a tablespoon of avocado oil (around £5 for 250ml) in a blender until smooth. Wet hair and apply mixture. Cover with a plastic cap and leave for 20 minutes. Rinse thoroughly.

Avocado hair conditioner was one of the more successful homemade recipes that Anna tried

Verdict: Despite only using a small amount, my hair felt very nice and soft afterwards. Given the amount I’ve spent on conditioner over the years, I’d definitely try this again.

Dr Williams says: ‘Avocado is a skin-friendly food, as it contains lots of mono-unsaturated fat, as well as vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. But whether these would penetrate skin when applied topically is a different question.

‘It may have some benefit in making the hair shaft smoother, but this will be a temporary benefit, as there is no scientific evidence it does anything for scalp health.’

Anna gives coconut deodorant a go

COCONUT OIL

The world has gone coconut oil crazy, with cooks switching butter or extra virgin oil for the super-oil that is said to boost cholesterol and have antibacterial properties.

Fans say it can also be used as anything from mouthwash to moisturiser and one brand, Luxe Paris, has even created a coconut deodorant for £8.50.

Recipe: To make your own coconut oil deodorant, mix four tablespoons each of baking soda and arrowroot, then use a fork to mash in six teaspoons of coconut oil (around £2 for 500ml at supermarkets and healthfood stores), which is solid at room temperature.

A few drops of essential oil will add scent. Mould into an empty deodorant stick, if you have one, or a shot glass works just as well. If the homemade stick gets floppy and difficult to work with, add a little more of the powdered ingredients.

Verdict: Although this is a natural deodorant, it is not an antiperspirant (to prevent wetness), so if sweating is an issue, this won’t suit.

Nevertheless, this worked better than I expected. I wore it out running, and found I didn’t smell afterwards. It also softened my underarm skin.

Dr Williams says: ‘Coconut oil does have anti-inflammatory properties when used on skin, so it can protect, soothe, hydrate and strengthen the skin’s barrier function.’
