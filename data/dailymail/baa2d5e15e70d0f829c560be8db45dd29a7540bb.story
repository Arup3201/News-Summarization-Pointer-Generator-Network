Police seized a 'glow-in-the-dark' supercar from a London street after its wealthy Qatari owner was stopped for not having a licence or the correct insurance.

The £350,000 Lamborghini Aventador - with a paint job that made it look like something out of the sci-fi film Tron - was impounded near Harrod's in Knightsbridge yesterday.

It is understood its owner is 24-year-old Nasser Al-Thani, a member of Qatar's ruling family.

Supercar: Police stopped the driver of the £350,000 Lamborghini Aventador in Knightsbridge, London

Sci-fi: The customised car has scissor doors and a glow-in-the-dark paint job that makes it look like something out of the film Tron

Stopped: Police seized the car after its driver failed to produce a driving licence or correct insurance documents

Problem: Pictured earlier in the day, the supercar understood to be owned by 24-year-old Nasser Al-Thani, of Qatar's ruling family, was also missing a front numberplate

Attraction: A crowd gathered around the unusual-looking car as police waited for a tow truck to arrive

Police stopped the car, which was also missing its front number plate, on Brompton Street and had it towed away after Mr Al-Thani failed to produce a licence or the correct insurance.

A crowd gathered around the ostentatious scissor-door car, which has been customised by a Japanese tuning company, as three police officers on motorbikes waited for the tow-truck to arrive.

When a low-loader finally appeared, an officer slowly drove the supercar onto the back before it was transported to a local pound.

One onlooker said: 'It is great when the 
wealthy foreign tourists come over to London every summer as you always 
see these amazing supercars.

'The Lamborghini looked like something out of Tron, it was absolutely stunning.' 

Ticket: Police attached a note explaining why they were seizing the Lamborghini

Backing up: A low-loader arrived to take the supercar away from Brompton Street, Knightsbridge

Wealthy Middle-Eastern drivers descend on the capital in their supercars every summer and have even been the subject of a Channel 4 documentary, Millionaire Boy Racers, which showed angry residents saying their driving style was ruining the area for locals.

The Al-Thani family are renowned for 
their wacky supercars and hit the headlines three years ago when 
their blue Lamborghini and Koenigseggs were clamped outside Harrods.

The Lamborghini Aventador is one of the world’s fastest supercars.

It is powered by a 6.5-litre V12 engine which gives a 0-62mph time of 2.9 seconds and a top speed of 217mph.
