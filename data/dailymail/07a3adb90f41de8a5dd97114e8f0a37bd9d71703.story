Victim: Gerardo I. Hernandez was shot and killed by a gunman at the Los Angeles International Airport on Friday

The name of the TSA agent who was killed in the Los Angeles airport shooting has been revealed just hours after the rampage.

Gerardo Hernandez was identified as the 39-year-old victim of Friday morning's attack.

Friends and family have begun paying their respects to the slain public servant, saying that he was a loving husband and caring father who enjoyed spending his free time with his two children.

Hernanez's cousin told friends on Facebook that he was destroyed by his death.

A different family friend told MailOnline that she had known Hernandez's wife for years.

The woman said that Hernandez had worked at Los Angeles International Airport for three years before his death on Friday.

The Wrap has identified the victim's wife as Ana Machuca, the marketing budget manager for Warner Brothers.

'It’s devastating because he was such a great guy. All he talked about was his family,' Hernandez's friend Kevin Maxwell told NBC Los Angeles.

The slain agent was a father of two- as Maxwell said that Hernandez was 'very proud' of his son and 'spoke profoundly' of his daughter.

Family: Hernandez, seen in the center with a mustache, was the father of two children and is married

Family man: Hernandez, seen here with his wife Ana and other family members, was rushed to the hospital but doctors said that his injuries were too severe for him to be rescued as he did not have a pulse

A doctor at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center told NBC News that Hernandez was one of two shooting victims who were taken to the hospital, but there was no chance of his survival.

A round of shots broke into fragments inside his torso and caused chest injuries while setting off debilitating internal bleeding.

'We made every effort to stop the bleeding and get the heart to beat on his own,' Dr David Plurad told the news station.

He was the first TSA agent ever to be killed at an airport while working for the government.

'No
 words can explain the horror that we experienced today when a shooter 
took the life of a member of our family and injured two TSA officers at 
Los Angeles International Airport,' TSA administrator John Pistole wrote
 in a letter.

'Sadly, 
today marks the first incident where a TSA officer was killed in the 
line of duty. We can take some comfort knowing that the two injured 
officers are recovering from their wounds.'

City officials have ordered several tributes be paid to Hernandez across Los Angeles, as the flags at all government-owned buildings in the area will be flown at half mast.

The LAPD chief has also mandated that all police officers wear black bands on their police badges in his honor.

Hernandez
 died at the hands of shooter Paul Anthony Ciancia, a 23-year-old man 
who walked into Los Angeles International airport and walked to the 
security checkpoint where TSA agents examined traveler's passports and 
boarding passes before allowing them into the terminal.  

Tragic: A TSA agent is comforted after the shooting outside of Terminal 1. The only confirmed fatality was a TSA agent, who has now been identified as Gerardo Hernandez (not pictured)

Securing the scene: Police found a note near Ciancia's bag at the airport where he wrote about his anti-government leanings and signed it with a reference to a well-known conspiracy theory

Reports from the scene describe how Ciancia calmly removed a semi-automatic weapon from the bag that he had with him and started shooting. 

He is believed to have targeted TSA 
agents specifically, using their bright blue uniforms as a way to 
distinguish them from the traveling masses.

When
 that was not enough to help him decide whether or not to shoot, Ciancia
 asked individuals if they were members of the Transportation Security 
Administration. 

Traveler Leon Saryan who spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper about how he feels the gunman was clearly targeting TSA agents.

'I
 was just getting ready to pick up my shoes and belt and pick up my 
other stuff... (when) people hit the ground and then started to run,' Mr
 Saryan told CNN. 

Targets: Multiple witnesses recounted how he asked them if they worked for TSA, and when they said they did not he just continued walking. (This is not believed to be Hernandez, but another victim)

Chaos: A police officer answers questions as three of the terminals were closed immediately after the shooting. Airport police helped shoot the gunman, hitting him multiple times but not killing him

He said that while he was going to get his shoes taht were waiting on the conveyer belt, a uniformed TSA agent 'grabbed the shoes and the two of us started running down the corridor towards the gate. This agent got hit it seemed to be a grazing wound.'

At that point the agent kept running and seemed fine because the bullet hit him in the shoulder as Mr Saryan huddled in the corner- right when the gunman came up to him.

'(Suspect Paul Ciancia) looked at me and said "TSA?" I just shook my head and he kept going,' Mr Saryan told Anderson Cooper. 

'It was kind of hard to see his expression. I was more focused on the weapon.

'If I had a TSA uniform I wouldn't be here talking to you.'
