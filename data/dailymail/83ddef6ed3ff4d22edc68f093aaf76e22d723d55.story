Roberto Mancini knows his second coming at Internazionale will be a whole lot tougher than his first after this Milan derby. Where previously he commanded players the calibre of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Patrick Vieira in a league shorn of Juventus, his squad now are not at that level and Juventus reign supreme.

He returned to the San Siro dugout, where he won three Serie A titles and two Coppe Italia before his sacking in May 2008, more experienced from his time at Manchester City.

He will need all his nous to send Inter to the summit once more. In his first match since taking over from Walter Mazzarri, Mancini oversaw a 1-1 draw here, in an encounter that was low on quality.

It did include a wonderful goal from Jeremy Menez in the 23rd minute. The French international applied a cushioned volley of exquisite technique to Stephan El Shaarawy’s cross to send the ball past Samir Handanovic with pinpoint accuracy. Credit to Michael Essien for the clever pass that unleashed El Shaarawy.

Joel Obi found an equaliser that Mancini’s side deserved in the second half, to leave both Milan teams with a point that neither will really savour.

Rather like Arsenal versus Manchester United on Saturday evening, this was a match between two once proud title challengers reduced to hopefuls for their country’s final Champions League place.

It was eighth versus ninth, each far back from leaders Juventus, who look likely to run away with this Scudetto as they did the last.

Inter won most recent of their five successive Serie A titles (the first awarded when Juventus were stripped due to the Calciopoli scandal) in 2010, when Jose Mourinho left for Real Madrid. They have had six permanent managers since but zero trophies, now turning once more to Mancini.

AC last won the Scudetto under Massimiliano Allegri in 2011 and this year replaced Clarence Seedorf with his former teammate Filippo Inzaghi following poor results. Neither Milan club finished in the top four last season.

But while the football may not be what it once was, the atmosphere remains fearsome. Rival ultras at either end of this shared stadium produced impressive banners before kick-off and kept the flag-waving and noise going throughout the match.

Inside the first three minutes, each set of supporters bayed for a penalty. Inter cried loud as Mauro Icardi fell, AC when Michael Essien went down.

The cat calls were sent Icardi’s way in the eighth minute when the Inter striker missed a glorious chance.

Obi's exuberant celebration went on as he capped off a nice move to slot home to level the scores 

Menez's team-mates piled on top of him after the Frenchman gave the hosts the lead with his measured finish 

Sulley Muntari, who played in Inter’s 2010 Champions League final success, must have thought he still wore Milan blue rather than red – carelessly placing a pass straight to the 21-year-old Argentine that allowed him bear down on goal.

But as Icardi approached the area his confidence seemed to ebb away and Diego Lopez, an experienced goalkeeper, managed to block his tame finish before Philippe Mexes scrambled the ball clear. Dozens of AC fans in the Curva Sud raced from their seats to mock their rival player nearby.

Icardi would fare no better nine minutes after the interval, when the ball came his way in the area after a goalmouth scramble that should have seen Inter equalise, only for him to balloon the ball high over the bar.

With 12 minutes remaining Icardi found space in the area to arrive onto a cross from the right but sent his shot onto the top of the crossbar.

He was not the only striker who struggled, however. Fernando Torres continues to perform with nothing like the drive and ruthlessness that characterised his glory years at Liverpool.

Escaping from Chelsea on loan, this was supposed to offer the freedom he never really found at Stamford Bridge. There was little evidence of that. At one stage in the first half he had the chance to run at Brazilian defender Juan Jesus but lacked conviction and was easily dispossessed. The Spaniard was replaced by Keisuke Honda after 72 minutes.

Even Nemanja Vidic, who Torres used to terrorise in England, would have fancied his chances had he made it from the bench. That the former Manchester United captain failed to feature here undermines to some degree the accusations his departure from Old Trafford was shocking mismanagement.

Inter were the better side up until AC took the lead but found an equaliser just after the hour mark. Obi wriggled past Essien on the edge of the area and swept a left foot shot that angled inside the far post and beyond the dive of 6ft 5in Lopez.

No such composure from El Shaarawy in the 75th minute. Menez seized on a heavy touch from Juan Jesus to send the AC winger clean through but, at the same end where Icardi missed, he lifted his finish too high and the ball clipped the crossbar and went over.

At the death Andrea Poli almost won it for AC but his deflected shot trundled just wide. Mancini could head down the tunnel with a smile.
