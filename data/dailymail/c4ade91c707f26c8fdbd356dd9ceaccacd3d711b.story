Back surgery: Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service's Chief Fire Officer Mark Yates, used £3000 of taxpayer money for his back operation

A fire chief who earns £122,000-a-year has been criticised for spending £3,000 of taxpayers’ money to fund a private back operation.

Mark Yates, 50, the Chief Fire officer for Hereford and Worcester's Fire and Rescue Service spent the money on surgery which took place at a private hospital in October last year and was part-funded by the taxpayer.

Since his operation he has received widespread support from the county's fire authority which said that the money was ‘well spent.’

But critics argue that the high-earning officer should not have used taxpayers' money to sort out his private health problem.

A Freedom of Information request revealed Mr Yates had refused to have the routine surgery carried on the NHS after he was told that he would have to wait 12 weeks to have it done.

Instead of waiting, Mr Yates spent £5,090 on the surgery and the next month he asked Hereford and Worcester Fire Authority, which is funded by the taxpayer, to cover the cost.

The Authority agreed to pay £3,000 towards the operation as well as £240 for his physiotherapy.

The fire service he heads is currently facing significant cuts to services with stations at risk of closure and engines due to be removed to help save £4million by 2016.

John O’Connell, Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Residents will be angry that they’ve had to cough up to pay for private treatment, when very few of them are able to afford it for themselves.

‘It says something when the public sector top brass don’t use the NHS for their treatment, especially as everyone else is expected to be happy with it.

‘These perks must be scrapped, as taxpayers already foot hefty salaries and pensions.’

But
 councillor Derek Prodger, chairman of Hereford and Worcester Fire 
Authority, defended the decision saying Mr Yates was ‘very brave’.

He said: ‘Before the operation, he did get into work, but he was struggling at his desk, he was very brave.

‘If
 he went into an NHS hospital, it would have taken much longer. We 
wanted the chief back quickly and it was money well spent in my view.

‘He
 had no real length of time off (before the surgery), but we looked at 
the figures and felt it was more expedient to get it done quickly.

‘The
 Fire Authority took the decision to make a payment towards the cost of 
the Chief Fire Officer’s back operation as it was at a time when the 
Authority was running a very detailed public consultation which affected
 the future of Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service.

‘As
 such a significant piece of work was taking place we felt it necessary 
to have the Chief Fire Officer back to work and fully fit as quickly as 
possible.’

But Councillor Richard Udall, who opposed granting Mr Yates the money, said: ‘I think it is shocking that he managed to get this operation virtually fully paid for.

‘It simply isn’t right that the public sector should subsidise private sector health care.

‘Mr Yates clearly is a well paid man, he had a very good salary, better than most and during the meeting I made my position very clear.

‘I don’t think the other councillors and Mr Yates can be surprised at the backlash they are receiving.

‘It was common sense for me to reject his operation being paid for from the taxpayers, it isn’t fair and he should have enough money to cover the costs.’

Steve Gould, secretary of the county’s Fire Brigades Union said: ‘This is very disappointing. We are facing losing jobs and engines.

‘If the fire authority can get railroaded into something like this what is the chance of saving appliances?

‘Yet again the fire service is being dragged to the forefront and its nothing to do with firefighters, it’s senior management.’

In a statement, Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service, said: ‘He (Mr Yates) was likely to be off work for up to 12 weeks whilst waiting for an NHS operation.

‘Where NHS waiting lists are lengthy, the service has previously paid for staff members to be referred privately for consultant appointments.

‘In addition, we also fund other services for counselling and physiotherapy through occupational health.

‘Each instance is reviewed on a case-by-case basis and all options are considered where it is deemed to be cost effective in progressing a diagnosis or treatment to enable an earlier return to work, and shown to be in the best interests of the service.

‘Elected members considered it was in the Fire Authority’s best interests that he was able to return to work as soon as possible and therefore agreed to contribute £3,000 towards the total £5,090 cost of having the operation privately.

‘This contribution was less than the estimated £8,500 cost of additional payments to other officers if he had been absent for a prolonged period.’

Mr Yates, who took over as Chief Fire Officer in April 2010, was unavailable for comment because he is on annual leave until  March 26, the fire service said.
