This is the moment a man told he would never walk again stands from his wheelchair and defies doctors to take his agonising first steps.

Sheer determination evident across his face, Nick Carr, 26, appears to be wracked with pain as he stands up for the first time in 23 years.

He was left wheelchair-bound after he was struck down with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, when he was just three.

Determined: Nick Carr, who was told he would never walk again, steps from his wheelchair for the first time with the help from his carer John Williams

Defying the odds: Nick was left wheelchair-bound after he was struck down with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, when he was just three

Doctors told him that he would never stand or walk again but Mr Carr, of Truro, Cornwall, has now defied the odds.

He climbed out of his chair and, still clinging to its arms, walked 65 feet in front of an emotional crowd.

Mr
Carr spent a year training in a gym to prepare for his effort, which helped to raise money for a new sports centre for disabled people.

'It was incredibly tough and very painful,' he said. 'I knew there were a lot of people watching me, but I was focused on getting the walk done.

'It felt amazing to do this for such a worthy cause.'

Mr Carr completed the challenge, aided by carer John Williams, at Lemon Quay in Truro surrounded by crowds of people cheering him on.

He joined his friends Keith Cornick and John Williams as they took part in a 1,000-mile charity tour of the UK from John O’Groats in Scotland to Land’s End in Cornwall.

Together the trio raised more than £10,000 for the new state-of-the-art Centre of Challenge and Innovation in Truro.

The centre is a proposed £20million new unit which, if built, will house a diving pool, rock climbing wall, sky-diving tunnel and wave rider.

Denise Boaden, part of the Centre for Challenge’s driving force, said: 'It was inspirational and very moving.

'People were cheering Nick on and a few people were crying. It was very emotional.'
