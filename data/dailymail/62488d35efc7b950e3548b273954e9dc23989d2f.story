A 92-year-old Florida man is lucky to be alive after he crashed his car into a canal and was rescued by a medical student who happened to be working nearby.

Captured on video, the dramatic ordeal unfolded on Wednesday in Port St. Lucie when Salvatore Mancuso's car sped into the water alerting the attention of Alton Brieske, who was eating lunch.

Seeing the car sinking quickly, Brieske and his friend, Michael Markisello, jumped into the water, grabbed a hammer and smashed the window, dragging Mr. Mancuso to the shore where they performed CPR.

Rush to help: Alton Brieske saw Mr. Mancuso crash his car into the canal and then jumped into the water immediately to help (right)

Without a second thought: Brieske said that when he saw the car drive into the water he just acted on instinct

'I immediately just took my shirt off and took my shoes off and just dove into the water,' said Brieske to CBS 12.

'I started shouting, 'I need a hammer!'I need something to break this window so I can get in and pull him out.'

Smashing the window three times before it shattered, Brieske then faced a race against time to get Mr. Mancuso out before the water filled the car.

'I broke that window, popped the lock, opened the door,' said Brieske to WPBF. 'That's when the water started rushing in, so I just acted fast, popped his seat belt off, put my arm under his shoulder and got him out of the car.'

CPR: Med-student Brieske then performed CPR on Mr. Mancuso, who police believe lost consciousness before the crash 

Brieske, who is hoping to become an ER physician, rescucitated Mr. Mancuso after they got him out of the water.

'It was just instinct. I just got in there, got him out and started CPR,' said Brieske.

'I palpated for a pulse and couldn’t find one. I was listening for a breathing rhythm and couldn’t find one, so that’s when I started CPR.'

Police said after the heroic rescue that it is likely Mr. Mancuso suffered a loss of consciousness before the accident.

The police were quick to praise Brieske and said that without his quick thinking and actions, Mr. Mancuso would have died.

'Very heroic. We’re so thankful for people to come to the aid of others!' said Sgt. Frank Sabol to CBS 12.

Brieske, who was called a guardian angel by his friend, was humble about his brave rescue.

'I was just in the right spot at the right time. I mean, yes, it was a heroic act if that's what you want to call it. But, I was just doing what anybody else would do,' said Brieske.
