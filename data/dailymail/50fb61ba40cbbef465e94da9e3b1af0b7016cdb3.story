Two prostitutes allegedly murdered by a British investment banker in Hong Kong had travelled from their homes in Indonesia to seek a better life, their friends said today.

The mutilated bodies of Sumatra Ningsih and Jesse Lorena were found in Rurik Jutting's flat in the early hours of Saturday morning.  

Miss Ningsih, whose decomposing body was stuffed in a suitcase on the balcony, had travelled to the former British colony only a month ago from her home in the central Java city of Cilacap.

Miss Lorena, who is believed to have been officially living in Hong Kong as a domestic helper, was said to be building a house back home and planned to return there soon.

Seeking a better life: Miss Lorena is thought to have been among the thousands of young Indonesian women who set out into the ‘outside world’ to take up a variety of jobs, many of them in the domestic service industry

The pair are believed to have been brought up as Muslims. 

MailOnline understands that her real name is Seneng Mujiasih and that she comes from the large Indonesian island of Sulawesi, joining the many thousands of young Indonesian women who set out into the ‘outside world’ to take up a variety of jobs, many of them in the domestic service industry.

She has told friends that she had earned enough money in her years in Hong Kong to be able to have a house built for herself and her family in Indonesia.

Hours before her murder, Miss Lorena gleefully told friends she was going to a Halloween party, adding: 'I'm going to have fun.'

Dutch DJ Robert van den Bosch, who has known Miss Lorena for four years, said he heard her talking to two friends outside a pub in Wan Chai’s red light district at around 8.45pm.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'She said "I’m going to have fun. I’m going to a Halloween party"

'Those really were the last words. Those are the two things repeating in my head.' 

Mr van den Bosch, who works at the pub, said it was a 'shock' when he learned of her brutal death the following day.  

Victim: One of the two women discovered inside Jutting's luxury apartment in Hong Kong. The woman, named locally as Jesse Lorena Ruri, was 30 years old and originally from the Philippines

Horrific death: Officers arrived at Jutting's blood-spattered 31st-floor apartment to find Jesse Lorena Ruri still alive despite gaping knife wounds to her throat and buttocks, but she died soon after

He said Miss Lorena had lived in Hong Kong for at least eight years after moving from a small island in Java to 'find a better life'.

Miss Lorena was regularly seen in the pubs and shops in the notorious red-light district, according to locals.

But Mr van den Bosch denied reports that she was a prostitute, saying she was a domestic helper who had been sending money back home to Indonesia where she was building a house.

'The terrible thing is that her house... was just finished and she said she would leave Hong Kong and go back to Indonesia to enjoy life, he added. 

Eight hours after her body was found, during a forensic examination of the flat, police officers spotted a suitcase on the balcony which had two feet protruding.

Inside was the decomposing naked body of the second prostitute, 25-year-old Indonesian Sumarti Ningsih.

According to a spokesman for Indonesia’s Head of Development and Productivity Placement Miss Ningsih had approached a private ‘placement company’ in Cilacap, which found her a job in Hong Kong, although it was not immediately known what that work was.

Officials from several welfare and workers’ organisations said they were still trying to trace family members of both women who might not be aware of the grisly murders.

Referring to the 25-year-old, a spokesman for the Department of Social Welfare and Manpower, said: 'We are trying to trace the address of Miss Ningsih,’

Calacap, a south coast port town lying nearly 200 miles south east of Jakarta, has a population of more than a million and competition for work is said to be intense.

It was cut off from air travel when the airport closed several years ago and travellers are now faced with a tedious journey along roads jammed with motor scooters.

Tourists are put off from visiting because the town’s most well known beaches have become fouled from leakage from shipping vessels that dock nearby.

Despite the authorities' efforts to clean up the area, it is filled with hotel rooms that can be rented by the hour.

One user wrote on the internet: 'The more expensive ones almost seem like normal business hotels – the cheaper ones are like mental hospitals.'

Robberies and money-laundering are also rife and Chinese gangsters are said to run many of the bars.

Wan Chai – where Rurik Jutting is thought to have picked up £200-a-night prostitutes – is Hong Kong's notorious red light district.

Just two blocks away from his apartment, hundreds of bars and clubs are teeming with mainly south-east Asian sex workers, who offer 'lady drinks' to potential customers before discreetly negotiating prices for sex.

The area was made infamous by the 1960 film The World of Suzie Wong, about a Chinese prostitute.

Prostitution is legal in Hong Kong, but many women working as 'freelancers' are doing so illegally as they are there on tourist visas – including Miss Ningsih. 

Officials who take responsibility for foreigners in the colony said that was not her real name.
