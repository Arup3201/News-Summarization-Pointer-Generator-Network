Difficult life in the spotlight: Whitney Houston faced an extortion plot shortly after her marriage to Bobby Brown, and a constant stream of obsessive fan mail

Whitney Houston's troubled private life was laid bare yesterday when the FBI revealed it kept a 128 page-file on her - including obsessive fan letters and details of an extortion attempt.

Shortly after Houston married singer Bobby Brown, a 'close friend' who was 'privy to 
much personal information' allegedly attempted to blackmail her.

A
Chicago lawyer wrote to her production company threatening that unless the singer paid $100,000 (£66,000), his client 
planned to 'reveal details of [Houston's] private life to 
several publications'.

Later the blackmail amount was upped still 
higher to $250,000 (£165,000).

Whitney's father apparently sent the perpetrator a confidentiality 
agreement and an unknown sum of money.

The FBI monitored her at the height 
of her fame between 1988 and 1999 and the files show a decade of dealing with intrusive fans.

In 1999 she began receiving letters
and cassette tapes from the Netherlands which she found 
threatening.

The
FBI interviewed the man, who made outlandish claims that he was the 'President of Europe', purchased Brazil for $66billion and helped 
Nelson Mandela win election in South Africa.

Among her fan letters sent by a man from Vermont, New England wrote that he 'might hurt someone with some crazy idea.'

He proclaimed his love for the late singer through more than 70 letters in a 17-month period, sent to Houston at the height of her fame.

The file shows the FBI interviewed the man but the bureau concluded no law was broken because the man said that all he wanted was to proclaim his love for her publicly.

After the peak of her career, her behaviour was increasingly erratic.

She suffered a long battle with drugs, including cocaine, as well as alcohol and spent various spells in rehab.

Recent appearances had become increasingly erratic and the years of substance abuse had clearly taken a toll.

She cancelled a string of concerts and talk shows as she struggled to cope.

In a chat show with Oprah in 2003, 
the star admitted the scale of her addiction to smoking crack cocaine. 
'It was every day, every,' she said. 'I didn't think about the singing 
part of it any more.'

Her powerful voice began to suffer 
because of her demons prompting record sales to nosedive and in 2007 she
split from husband Bobby Brown after 15 years of marriage.

Houston was found dead in 11 February last year in a Beverly Hills hotel bath. She was 48.

Authorities said 
her death was an accidental drowning due to cocaine use and heart disease.

Paramedics battled to revive the singer but she was pronounced dead hours before she had been due to perform at a pre-Grammys party.

Even Houston's funeral was not 
without drama. While her daughter with Bobby Brown, Bobbi Kristina, 19, 
was in the front row of the church with Houston's mother both in black, 
ex-husband Bobby Brown stormed out.

Brown had argued with Houston's family over the number of guests he was allowed to bring.

Brown was driven away from the funeral but 
later returned in time for the start of the home going service.

Her mentor, who first gave Houston a 
record deal, Clive Davis told the congregation, 'You wait a life time 
for that kind of voice to come along'.
