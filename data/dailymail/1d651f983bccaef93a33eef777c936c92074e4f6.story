There was an art-buying frenzy in New York last night as two works from Andy Warhol's Death And Disaster series made more than $100million at auction.

They were among 68 pieces sold by Christie's New York City branch for a mammoth total of more than $744 million. All prices included the buyer's premium.

Warhol's Race Riot, 1964 — a provocative four-panel painting of unrest in Birmingham, Alabama — went for $62.9million, smashing the estimate of $45million.

The work was a direct response to an 
article Warhol saw in Life magazine that ran with an image by Associated
 Press photographer Charles Moore.

And
 his 1962 painting White Marilyn, completed shortly after Marilyn Monroe
 took her life, sold for $41million, more than double its upper estimate
 of $18million.

Barnett Newman's 
Black Fire I, a 1961 canvas showing a thick column of black alongside 
smaller ribbons of white and black, went for $82.4million, far surpassing his auction record set 
last year when Onement VI went for $43.8 million at rival Sotheby's.

The New York artist died in 1970 at age 65.

Francis
 Bacon's Three Studies For A Portrait Of John Edwards sold for 
$80.8million. The price surged quickly from an opening bid of 
$50million.

The 1984 work 
came onto the market a year after Christie's sold Bacon's 1969 Three 
Studies Of Lucian Freud for $142.4million, setting a world record for 
the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction.

Bacon,
 who died in 1992, named Mr Edwards his sole heir. Mr Edwards oversaw 
the British artist's archives until his death in 2003.

The
 three-panel work shows him in a relaxed pose sitting on a stool with 
his right leg crossed over his left knee. Christie's says it is one of 
the greatest paintings from the artist's late period.

Mark
 Rothko's Untitled, a large abstract oil painting with colours ranging 
from a silvery mist to a deep violet, fetched $66.2million.

Jeff
 Koons' Jim Beam J.B. Turner Train, a 9½ -foot-long-stainless steel 
sculpture filled with bourbon, sold for $33.8million. His Balloon Dog 
(Orange) sold last spring for $58.4million, setting a world auction 
record for a living artist.

Jean-Michel
 Basquiat's seminal 1981 painting of a regal warrior figure sold for 
$34.9 million. The work, replete with graffiti imagery and text, marked 
the New York artist's 'transcendence from the leading figure on the 
underground art scene to the established world of international art 
stardom,' said Christie's.

More art goes under the hammer at Sotheby's today.

A
 1986 group of six Warhol self-portraits is expected to bring $25million
 to $35million. The identical silk-screen images in different colors 
depict Warhol in his famous 'fright wig'.

Among other standouts at Sotheby's is Koons' 7-foot-tall stainless steel sculpture, Popeye, estimated to bring $25million.
