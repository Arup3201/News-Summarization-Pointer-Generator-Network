If QPR count as giants, then surely the entry barrier is too low. That is not to skimp on the praise due to Sheffield United or indeed the manager with the famous bloodline and delightful habit of embarrassing bigger clubs.

But the shock of this result needs to be considered against one truth — Queens Park Rangers are capable of staggering incompetence and yesterday was an example of a struggling club close to their worst.

It was their misfortune to run into a side that has now won 14 of 17 cup fixtures under Nigel Clough. A side that in the past year has beaten five Barclays Premier League clubs, contested the semi-finals of the FA Cup and will play Tottenham Hotspur this month in the last four of the Capital One Cup.

MOTM: Jamal Campbell-Ryce

Not bad for a team from League One who in the past month have had less publicised engagements with Walsall, Fleetwood and Port Vale and taken only two points.

One can only wonder how the QPR of this tie would do in such fixtures.

It was all neatly summed up when, at 1-0 down to a Marc McNulty goal, Rangers goalkeeper Alex McCarthy came to collect a corner but flapped and missed.

Jamal Campbell-Ryce watched the farce unfold and stuck out a leg to make it 2-0. The forward then had the good fortune to be close by when Leroy Fer’s dreadful late header to McCarthy landed in his path and 2-0 became 3-0.

Harry Redknapp, the QPR manager, was furious, even if the cynical view is probably correct —this early exit will probably help in the bigger picture of Premier League survival.

But that is a mission that will require a happy squad and results like this, against a club 34 league places beneath them, ought to sting. Redknapp said: ‘I thought they were sharper than us all over the pitch. They played well and you have to give them credit — they are a good cup side. They obviously raise their game in the cup.

‘But we looked sluggish. The last goal summed us up. It was horrendous. There were no positives, not really. I couldn’t take any in fact.’

The tone was no more positive on the subject of transfers.

QPR have yet to record even a point on the road in the Premier League and are in desperate need of reinforcements. Redknapp is focusing on the loan market and made the concerning admission yesterday that he does not have a clue who will come in.

He said: ‘We are only looking for a loan or two. That is where we are at. Who do you find on loan at this time of year?

‘It’s very difficult. We are not close to doing any deals at all. I haven’t got a clue where we will find any at the moment.’

Redknapp made seven changes to the side that drew with Swansea City on New Year’s Day, but it was Fer — one of the four survivors – who had the best chance to set this game on a different path.

Receiving the ball with his back to goal after seven minutes, he hit a hard shot on the turn that forced a good save from Blades goalkeeper Mark Howard. That was pretty much as good as it got.

United settled and started to create chances, although QPR’s propensity for self-destruction provided generous help.

The breakthrough came on 36 minutes. Louis Reed played a through-ball, defender Rio Ferdinand was unsure whether to step out or attack the ball and in the event did neither, meaning McNulty had a path to goal. McCarthy got a touch on the ball but not enough for it to matter.

The QPR goalkeeper was far more culpable for United’s second goal, four minutes after the break.

Reed hit a corner to the near post, McCarthy came, missed and watched as the ball clattered off Jordon Mutch and towards his own goal-line. Campbell-Ryce poked it over.

When Fer made a hash of a header back to his keeper in stoppage time, it was Campbell-Ryce who pounced again.

Sheffield United coach Chris Morgan, speaking in place of Clough, said: ‘I don’t think people will take us lightly, because of the results we’ve had. In the last calendar year we’ve beaten five Premier League clubs.

‘We had the great run in the FA Cup last season and we were confident of getting a result but we had to work hard.

‘It’s great that we have good runs in the cup — great for the club, great for the revenue and for the fans — but we know that first and foremost our target is promotion.

‘It sends a message to us that we can come and compete with top teams.’

A label that served as the only consolation for QPR all day.
