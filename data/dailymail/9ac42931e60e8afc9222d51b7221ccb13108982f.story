A veteran Marine and the brave dog that once accompanied him as he searched out and diffused IEDs in Afghanistan had an emotional reunion Thursday after four painful years apart.

Corporal Jeff DeYoung never stopped being thankful to his black Labrador pal Cena even after they were separated suddenly and without getting to say goodbye in April 2010.

Thanks to non-profit group Mission K9 Rescue, which works to make such reunions possible, the two old friends came together once again and Cena, who retired after six years of service, took her place in his growing family.

Happy reunion: Four years after they were separated without getting to say goodbye, veteran Marine Corp Corporal Jeff DeYoung was reunited with the bomb-sniffing dog Cena who helped keep him and his fellow soldiers safe in Afghanistan

Since he was sent home in 2010, DeYoung has married and had two children. But the Muskegon, Michigan man never forgot the brave dog he'd bonded with at war.

'When he found the scent, he would lay down and would look at me,' DeYoung told ABC News. 'At that time, I knew within six feet of that area there was a bomb.'

The highly trained, life-preserving purebred can sniff out some 300 kinds of explosives. But he had his protector, too.

'My main goal was to protect him,' DeYoung said. 'I remember we would get into firefights and having to cover myself on top of him so he wouldn’t get harm. It was all about him.'

Long separation: DeYoung left for home in April 2010 and hadn't seen Cena since

DeYoung served in Afghanistan with Cena who was his contract working dog that specialized as a improvised explosive device detection search dog

'My main goal was to protect him,' DeYoung said. 'I remember we would get into firefights and having to cover myself on top of him so he wouldn¿t get harm. It was all about him.'

When DeYoung found out about Cena's impending retirement, he was connected with Mission K9 Rescue.

The organization's president Kristen Maurer soon traveled from her home in Texas all the way to Raliegh-Durham International Airport on Thursday, where she picked up the pooch.

Maurer then turned the car around and drove all the way to Detroit, where she'd make the reunion happen.

'The reunion was beautiful. They always are,'  Maurer told ABC News. 'Cena slammed her head into his chest once she realized who he was and she was so happy.'
