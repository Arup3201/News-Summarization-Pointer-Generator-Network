Video footage has been released of a hot air balloon bursting into flames when it hit power lines in an accident that killed three people.

The witness footage shows the balloon coming in to land in a field in Caroline County, Virginia, in May. It is seen descending, then is knocked off course when it hits the power lines, which are concealed by a line of trees.

An electrical surge is heard, then a fireball erupts in the basket. The witnesses are heard screaming as they realize what has happened, and telling each other to call 911.

Explosion: Footage released by the NTSB shows the hot air balloon catching fire in Caroline County, Virginia

Fatal: The crash last May killed all three people on board - two from falling and a third from the fire

Soaring: This image, taken shortly after the first video, shows the burning hot air balloon soaring into the sky after its fuel caught fire

Pilot Daniel Kirk, 65, and passenger Ginny Doyle, 44, were killed falling from the balloon after it burst into flame. The second passenger, 24-year-old Natalie Lewis, was killed by the fireball itself.

The footage shows Kirk, who had around 30 years' ballooning experience, activating the burners to lift the vehicle over the lines.

It can be heard firing for about 15 seconds, but the balloon continues to descend, and hits the wires, causing the explosion. 

Witnesses have said they heard the passengers screaming for help before the explosion, which took place at the end of a trip that was almost cancelled due to heavy fog.

Before the crash: The three are pictured here just before taking off. Heavy fog delayed the launch significantly - but the balloon flights still went ahead

The balloon was one of three in the air during the flight - though the other two landed safely. Doyle and Lewis, who both worked in college basketball, were supposed to take their trip in the morning, but it was pushed back because of the weather.

Video footage of the accident was released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), alongside a collection of photographs.

The images show charred instruments, the burnt-out propane tanks from the flight, an image of the landing field and also the burned and tattered remains of the balloon, which were found in a nearby river.

NTSB officials are yet to determine what caused the crash, but are expected to report back in less than a month, according to NBC 12. 

Wreckage: The NTSB also released photographs of evidence it gathered, including the canvas from the wrecked balloon
