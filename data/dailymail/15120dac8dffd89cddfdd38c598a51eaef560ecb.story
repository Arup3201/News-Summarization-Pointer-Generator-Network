A horrified drinker says he found 50 dead flies floating in a bottle of beer purchased from his local supermarket.

Daniel Bailey discovered the drowned insects in a bottle of his favourite Foster's Gold bought for a Friday night in with his mates.

Daniel from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, spat out a mouthful of lager after realising that the bottle had a disgusting taste.

Mr Bailey said he had already drunk two bottles of the lager before finding the flies in his third

After examining the beer, purchased from Asda in Nuneaton, Daniel realised that the cloudy liquid was infested with tiny flies.

Daniel said: 'I knew the beer didn't taste right, it tasted warm and salty and there were bits in it. The bottle was all cloudy and when I looked closer I realised that there were lots of flies in it.

'It was just unbelievable, it was completely vile.'

The 22-year-old who works for RS Components had already had two bottles from the Fosters six-pack when he reached for a third from the fridge.

Daniel said: 'You just never think to check the bottle before you drink it. It was blatantly clear there was insects floating in the bottle, I can't believe they don't check them before they sell them.

Daniel and his friend Hayten Patel of St Nicolas Road, Nuneaton, took the bottles back to Asda the next day and were awarded a refund but no explanation as to how the flies got into the bottle.

It is not known how the flies got into the bottle and Heineken said they would investigate

A spokesman for Heineken, the brand owner for Foster's in the UK, said: 'As the UK's leading brewer, product quality is of paramount importance to Heineken.

'We sell millions of bottles of Foster's Gold every year and we want consumers to enjoy our beer in top-class condition.

'To ensure this, we operate rigorous quality checks at our breweries at every stage of the brewing process.

'We are now liasing with Asda to obtain the bottle as part of our investigation into his complaint.'
