A Chinese high school student has won a place to study at a prestigious New York university after impressing tutors by writing about his love for instant noodles.

Xinghan Wang, 18, a senior student at Fuzhou No. 1 Middle School in Fujian province, was accepted by Rochester University after describing how his world vision had changed after tasting the snack.

Describing himself as a 'ramen enthusiast', he told how he had tried noodles from across Asia during trips to Singapore, Korea and Japan and also worked as a moderator on a ramen forum.

He explained how his love for noodles 
had started at a very young age and that whenever his parents were away,
 he would gorge on the snack, partly because he did not know how to cook
 rice.

Wang wrote: 'I tried the noodles during my trip to the country, and my world changed the moment I ate it'.

Counsellors
 at Rochester, ranked the 50th best private college in the United States
 and 60th best US colleges overall, were duly impressed and sent him an 
admission letter which the proud student later posted on Weibo.

The university, which has about 10,500 students, were also impressed by an essay he had written about his first day on the basketball team.

Jonathan Burdick, Vice Provost and Dean of College Admission, explained: 'Our applicant (who is high-achieving in many ways) wrote his humorous creative essay about being a fat kid (a “meatball”) on his first day on the basketball team, with dreams of being the next Nate Robinson.

'But the ramen was the detail that stuck with the first reader that we decided to reference in our offer of admission.'
