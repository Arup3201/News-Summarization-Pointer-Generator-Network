Ricky Muir's sacked political adviser Peter Breen worries the rookie Victorian senator will struggle without an experienced team around him.

Peter Breen became the second staffer in less than a week to be dumped by Senator Muir, who last Thursday also dismissed his chief adviser Glenn Druery.

Mr Breen, a former NSW politician, was accused of taking a sick day to visit a cultural festival and for leaking damaging claims about divisions within Senator Muir's staff to the press.

Ricky Muir's sacked political adviser Peter Breen worries the rookie Victorian senator will struggle without an experienced team around him

Far from being angry, Mr Breen laments no longer working for the Senate newcomer and is concerned his 'inexperienced' former boss faces an uphill battle without seasoned advisers by his side.

Mr Breen said Mr Muir can't do it on his own and needs an experienced team around him

'I just think the advice he's getting at the moment is not as good as it could be,' he told ABC radio on Wednesday.

'You really can't do it on your own. Ricky just needs all the help he can get.'

Mr Breen claims he was having surgery on the day he was accused of taking sick leave but says he did also attend the Byron Bay Writers Festival.

But he denies any part in leaking allegations of undermining and backstabbing within Senator Muir's staff, pointing the finger squarely at Mr Druery.

Mr Breen confirmed he made an 'incident report' to parliament about ruptures between Mr Druery and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party founder Keith Littler but didn't go public with the details.

'Unfortunately that was leaked to the press and that caused him (Senator Muir) a lot of grief,' Mr Breen said.

Known as the 'preference whisperer' for his role in getting micro-parties elected, Mr Druery has not commented on why his employment was cut short.

Mr Breen said his short stint with Senator Muir was exciting, praising his style as an 'ordinary' man representing real interests and people.

His support will prove crucial as the coalition government tries to push its budget measures through the Senate in coming months.
