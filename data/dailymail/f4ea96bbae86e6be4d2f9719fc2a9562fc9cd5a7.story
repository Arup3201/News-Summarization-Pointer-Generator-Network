It was a permanent reminder of one of the First World War's bloodiest battlefields, a scale model of the opposing lines created in an English field for the education of Allied troops.

Now a dig to uncover the model built by German prisoners of war which long since has become covered by earth and foliage is set to start.

Archaeologists will begin charting the site, the only example of its kind left in the UK, which was planned out in painstaking detail by troops returned from the Battle of Messines on the Western Front, fought in June 1917.

Archaeologists will begin charting the site of the Staffordshire model of the Battle of Messines, Belgium, which was planned out in painstaking detail by troops returned from the war

Experts said the terrain model was built 
not only as a training aid for other soldiers at Brocton Camp, in 
Staffordshire, but in recognition at the horrific toll of slaughter the 
battle - fought around the landmark Messines ridge - took on the 
brigade.

The ridge formed an anchor in the German front lines but the week-long offensive of infantry attack, aerial bombardment and heavy shelling resulted in an Allied victory with four Victoria Crosses awarded to Empire soldiers for bravery during the fight.

The terrible human cost of the battle ran to 50,000 men killed, wounded or missing across both sides.

The battle was fought in the build-up to the much larger and far bloodier Passchendaele offensive which would begin in July of that year.

Recreation: The battle field was recreated by veterans as well as German prisoners of war in the battle's aftermath. It was one of the First World War's bloodiest battlefields

During the construction of the model battlefield, the Army brought in its Corps field bakers to feed those involved in painstakingly rebuilding the war-zone

Staffordshire County Council, in a project funded by Natural England, is going to make a record of the model for future generations before re-covering the site on Cannock Chase in October.

Councillor Philip Atkins, county council leader, said Staffordshire was proud of its military heritage as the home of the National Memorial Arboretum and now was the right time to carry out the dig with the centenary of the war's outbreak falling next year.

He said: 'We see ourselves very much as custodians of the land and of the memories it holds, and this is a wonderful opportunity to bring the site back to life.'

An Officers Clubhouse was even erected for the project at Brocton Camp, Cannock Chase, as the reconstruction of the war-field began to take shape

The model was built by German prisoners of war, supervised by the New Zealanders, and then rendered in concrete.

It includes small-scale reconstructions of Messines village's buildings, including its church, together with trench positions, railway lines, roads, and accurate contours of the surrounding terrain.

Mr Atkins said: 'The idea to build a scale model was a stroke of genius and undoubtedly played a huge role in preventing the deaths of thousands of more men.

Then: Men were set to work digging trenches in the field designated as a model for the battle zone in Staffordhsire

Now: Archaeologists will have their work cut out for them to return the overgrown Cannock Chase area to its former replica model of the Messines terrain battlefield

'Due to the location, scale and fragile nature of the model it is impossible for it to be moved or left uncovered, but for a brief moment in time we all be able to share with the nation, memories of a piece of Staffordshire which helped change the course of history.'

Preparatory work on the site is starting today with the dig taking place next week.

The Battle of Messines took place on the Western Front in June 1917 in Belgium, around the village of Mesen

The
Battle of Messines was a major offensive conducted by the British 
Second Army, under the command of General Herbert Plumer, on the Western
Front near the village of Messines, Belgium.

Six
army Corps were involved in the offensive - three carried out the 
attack, two remained on the northern flank and one was available at 
short notice if needed.

The
offensive forced the German Army to move reserves to 
Flanders from the Arras and Aisne fronts, which relieved pressure on the
French Army.

Morale among French troops was low after the Neville offensive in the preceding months failed to achieve its aims.

The
tactical objective of the attack at Messines was to capture the German 
defences along the length of the ridge, which ran from Ploegsteert Wood 
in the south through Messines and Wytschaete to Mount Sorrel, to deprive
the German Fourth Army of the high ground south of Ypres.

Troops from the British Second Army fought in the Battle of Messines,
which took place along a ridge running south from Ypres. Pictured, men 
marching to trenches near Ypres in October 1914

The
British defences were positioned behind the ridge and back areas 
further north, from which the British intended to conduct the 'Northern 
Operation' - to advance to Passchendaele Ridge, then capture the Belgian
coast up to the Dutch frontie.

They included numerous divisions from Australia and New Zealand.

The
German Fourth Army divisions of Gruppe Wijtschate held the ridge; they 
were later reinforced by a division from Gruppe Ypern.

The battle began with the detonation of 19 mines, which devastated the German front line defences.

The
forces then followed with a creeping barrage, 700 yards (640m) deep, 
which allowed the advancing British troops to secure the ridge with 
support from tanks, cavalry patrols and aircraft.

British attacks from 8â€“14 June advanced the new front line beyond the former German line.

The
Battle of Messines is considered a prelude to the much larger Third 
Battle of Ypres campaign, the preliminary bombardment for which began a 
month later, on July 11 1917.
