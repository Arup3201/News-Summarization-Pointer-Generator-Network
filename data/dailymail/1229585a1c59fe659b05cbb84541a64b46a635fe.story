The Lib Dem women’s minister Jo Swinson was ridiculed yesterday for  suggesting that mothers should be allowed to bring  their babies into the House of Commons.

Respected Channel 4 newsreader Cathy Newman, who is also a working mother, said allowing MPs to bring their ‘bawling’ babies to Parliament would not ‘greatly advance the feminist cause’.

In a scathing article entitled ‘Has this MP gone gaga?’, Miss Newman suggested bringing a baby into any office, let alone Parliament, would distract women from the demands of their work because being a mother is a full-time job in itself.

‘Juggling life and work is hard enough
 without having a baby in the office competing with your boss for your 
time and attention,’ Miss Newman wrote.

Miss
 Swinson, 33, who is also a business minister, gave birth to her first 
child, Andrew, just before Christmas. She is married to Lib Dem MP 
Duncan Hames.

An MP who is 
breastfeeding may bring a baby into her own office, but not into the 
House of Commons or House of Lords chambers, or the division lobbies 
they pass through to vote. Miss Swinson said: ‘I hardly think it would 
be too much of a disruption. You can take a sword through there but you 
can’t a baby.’

Miss Newman,
 who is married with two children, said while she understood the 
minister wanted to ‘bang the drum for working mums’, her policy of 
‘carting’ babies around the workplace  was ill-judged.

‘Don’t
 get me wrong, I’m all for mums being encouraged to breastfeed, though 
too many are made to feel terribly guilty if they can’t make it work,’ 
she wrote in a Daily Telegraph blog.

‘I’m
 afraid, though, that it doesn’t greatly advance the feminist cause to 
allow MPs to cart their bawling babies through the lobby. The Commons is
 a workplace unlike any other, but a workplace nevertheless.

‘In
 my view, women should be able to breastfeed anywhere they need to, but I
 draw the line at looking after a baby – itself a full-time job – when 
you’re at work.’

Tory MP Sir Gerald Howarth also weighed into the debate, saying Miss Swinson’s suggestion was ‘wholly inappropriate’.

The former defence minister, and father of three, said: ‘The voting lobbies of the House of Commons are not a crèche.

‘Of
 course mothers will want to look after their young children but I don’t
 see the child’s welfare is served by taking them through the lobbies.’

Miss
 Newman, 39, who used to be a political correspondent for Channel 4, 
conceded that Parliament still had some way to go in becoming more 
family-friendly.

The 
answer, she said, was for politicians to deliver ‘more  flexible, more 
affordable childcare’, such as a nanny, childminder or nursery. ‘So I’m 
hoping that when Ms Swinson returns to work, she’ll have found loving, 
reasonably priced care for baby Andrew, leaving her free to focus on the
 tough demands of her day job,’ she said.
