Two dim-witted car thieves were caught after they ran into a police station as they tried to avoid the officers chasing them.

The teenagers were being pursued by police through Bromley, south London, after a car had been stolen in Petts Wood, four miles away, at 2.45am.

During the car chase, the pair screeched into Mason's Hill, a side road by Bromley Police Station, not realising it was a dead end.

No through road: Bromley police station is situated on a dead-end road, much to the misfortune of the fleeing youths

The pair leapt out of the car and dashed into Bromley Police Station, which is open 24 hours a day, looking 'flustered and confused', according to front office staff.

Police then arrested them.

A police spokesman said officers started chasing the car after it was reported stolen from nearby Petts Wood in the early hours of Saturday and failed to stop.

The car chase around Mottingham and Bromley came to an abrupt halt at the police station when the pair ditched the car.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Furphy from Bromley Police said; "To say we were surprised by their choice of attempted escape route is an understatement.

'Next time we'll leave the cell doors open and they can just run straight in.

'If only they were all this daft our job would be so much easier.'

'#nonetoobright': Bromley police tweet that revealed what the bungling teenagers had done

Police revealed details of the arrest on a Twitter feed with the hashtag, or Twitter key word sign, ‘nonetoobright’ on Monday.

The tweet stated: 'Two burglars/car thieves arrested after running into Bromley Police Station front office whilst attempting to evade capture! #nonetoobright.'

It added: 'Aforementioned two master criminals now charged and off to court.'

A 17-year-old, of Mottingham, south London, and a 14-year-old from Lewisham, south London, appeared at Bromley Youth Court on Monday, charged with theft of a motor vehicle and a string of driving offences.  The youths, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were bailed ahead of a hearing on December 4.
