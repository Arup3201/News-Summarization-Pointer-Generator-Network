A couple who had their wedding bands stolen the night before their big day went ahead with the ceremony regardless - using jelly sweets in place of the rings.

David and Natalie Norris were devastated after their home in Kingsley, Northants, was raided by burglars last Saturday.

The £1,000 bling was stolen, along with jewellery belonging to David's late mother, who passed away in February.

Sweethearts: Natalie and David Norris went ahead with their wedding, despite their rings being stolen from their home the night before. They used sweets instead, which they had blessed by the vicar and later ate

But David and Natalie, both nightclub owners, were determined not to let the burglars ruin their special day.

Determined to push ahead with their wedding day the couple found a unique alternative to replace their expensive rings: They used two ring-shaped sweets selected from a 99p bag of Haribo.

On Sunday they married, as planned, at The Manor Hotel in Meriden, West Midlands, going to nearby St. Laurence's Church, where the jelly rings were even blessed by vicar.

The happy couple then returned to the hotel to celebrate their nuptials with 170 guests - and eat their tasty new rings.

Joyus: 'Despite a fire alarm going off the day went without a major hitch and we are now looking forward to our new life together,' says Natalie

The couple, who have been together for 
19 years, had left a front door unlocked for their son to 
come in from work from a restaurant.

All
 the items had been left in the kitchen in preparation for their wedding
 and the usual intruder deterrents - the couple's two 40-kilo crossbreed
 dogs - had been taken into kennels.

Natalie, 39, said: 'It was one thing to know someone had been in your house, but the things they took were so personal.

'It was obvious they were wedding rings, they were on a table of wedding stuff - how anybody could stoop so low, I don't know.

'I was absolutely devastated. We looked
 for new rings in a few jewellery shops on Saturday, but we had taken
 so much time choosing our rings and waiting for them to be 
delivered, I didn't just want to get a new one.

Happy day: On Sunday David and Natalie tied the knot at The Manor Hotel in Meriden, West Mids., where they used two Haribo sweets to place on each others fingers

'I said I would rather use those jelly Haribo rings.

'We wanted to make light of it - but we also wanted to show them that the burglars couldn't ruin our big day.'

Despite a rogue fire alarm going off, the couple's special day went without any further hitch. They are appealing to pawn shop owners and secondhand dealers to look out for the stolen rings and jewellery and are looking forward to their new life together in the meantime.

'We weren't just going to lie down and let them spoil our wedding day,' says David, 43.

'We were determined to have fun regardless and we had a fantastic time in the end.

'It was a nice touch to get the rings blessed but we ate them in the end - they were getting very sticky.

'They [the burglars] are the lowest of the low, but you just have to get on with things. I just hope they get caught now.'

Along with the rings the burglars took a laptop, Pandora bracelet and Ted Baker and Calvin Klein bags.

David and Natalie are still planning to go on their honeymoon to Thailand for 10 days on Saturday.
