The mother of a toddler, who was caught on video violently cursing, has defended her parenting today as it was revealed that the child had been injured in a gang shooting at the family's home.

The little boy has since been placed in protective custody along with his 16-year-old mother Ennisha Devers, two other children and a baby in Omaha, Nebraska. The child and his mother have been separated but will find out on Monday whether they will be placed in the same foster home.

The video of the child swearing and knocking over furniture went viral after the Omaha police union posted the video on their website to show the 'cycle of violence and thuggery' that they often come up against in their work.

The video posting brought the police union under fire but the organization defended itself by revealing that the boy was recently injured in a gang shooting.

WARNING: Video contains graphic content

The little boy is seen flipping his middle finger and cursing on the tape which was posted online by the Omaha police union

Ennisha Devers, the child's 16-year-old mother said her son was being encouraged to use bad language by her brother's friend and that she had no knowledge of the tape

The
 video shows the boy wearing a diaper and being 
harangued with racial slurs and obscenities by at least three adults.

At one point, the child flips his middle finger, knocks over a chair and says: 'Shut up, b****.'

With encouragement of the adults' 
laughter, the little boy continues to curse and swear. The mother says 
that the video was filmed without her knowledge by her brother's friend.

Miss Devers told CNN:
 'He's a smart little boy. All that cussing that he did, he doesn't do 
that. Somebody told him to do that. My son doesn't do that. I don't 
allow it.'

She added: 'He had a clean diaper, the house was clean and like they said, kids curse, every kid does it.'

A toddler who was cursed at and encouraged to curse in a video posted online has been placed in protective custody

The screen door at the Omaha home has a bullet hole after shooting which left five people injured in October

The Omaha police union said it found 
the video on a known local gang member's Facebook page. The video has 
been viewed several thousand times and remains on the union's website.

According to ketv.com, recent court documents revealed the highly dangerous situation that the child was living in.

In October, the toddler was one of five injured when someone fired shots through their front door. 

The
 adults caring for the child repeatedly allowed known gang members into 
their home - even after the state paid twice to relocate the family away
 from danger.

The little boy's father is believed to have been killed in a gang-related shooting at the age of 17.

The boy's 
grandmother was arrested on weapons charges in December after guns were 
brought into the house while children were present. His grandfather is currently in prison for drug and felony charges. 

Facebook comments: People react to the video post from the self-proclaimed uncle of the toddler

Union President John Wells defended their decision to post the video saying 'a lot of these children end up dealing with law enforcement'

The police union defended the video posting saying that without the public scrutiny that followed it, the children would likely still be living in an extremely volatile situation. 

A statement from Omaha Police Officers' Association website read:'This is 100% about a criminal culture, a cycle of poverty, a cycle of lack of education , a cycle of lack of parenting and â€“ dare we say ''a thug cycle'' â€“ that is literally killing families and crushing the futures of innocent children across Omaha.'

'The
 whole point of this is to give an unfiltered view of what police 
officers deal with every day,' added Sgt. John Wells, president of the 
Omaha Police Officers Association.

At one point in the video, 
the adults reference a gang in northeast Omaha, which is where more than
 half of the city's roughly 40 homicides a year typically happen.

Willie Hamilton, executive director of Black Men United in Omaha, said 
the police union didn't have to post the video to promote discussion 
about helping families overcome poverty.

'It's
 almost like the kid was abused twice: once by the people in the video 
and once by the police officers association,' said Hamilton, whose group
 promotes mentoring and works to strengthen families.

Hamilton
 said if the police union had been concerned about this child, officers 
should have reached out to churches and community groups to help.

'If their overall goal was to educate people about the problems, this was an inept way to do it,' he said.

Omaha
 Police Chief Todd Schmaderer issued a statement on Tuesday to clarify that
 the department wasn't involved in posting the video and doesn't have 
control over what the union posts.

'I
 strongly disagree with any postings that may cause a divide in our 
community or an obstacle to police community relations,' Schmaderer 
said.
