The police investigation into the street brawl between billionaire James Packer and TV boss David Gyngell is unlikely to go ahead.

The case has stalled due to the fact neither Packer nor Gyngell has lodged an official complaint over the incident.

NSW Police have said publicly there was no compulsion for either person to be interviewed.

James Packer remains in Melbourne after flying out of Sydney after less than a day in which he turned up for work (above) visible bruised and then made an across town dash to meet with rival TV executives to David Gyngell's Nine Network

Acting assistant police commissioner Mark Walton held a press conference reiterating an appeal for anyone with information to come forward, but stressed no decision had been made on whether an offence had been committed.

He said whilst police had contacted their legal representatives neither man had been questioned over the incident and heavily watermarked images had made investigation difficult.

'We first became aware of it as it was released in the media,' he said. 'We did review our holdings to see if there was anything we missed.

'In the earlier material it was so difficult to see what was going on because of the branding of it, I certainly wasn’t expecting police to rush out there.

'As the material has become available and the police have started to form a view of what occurred, that is the appropriate time to hold our inquiries.'

Today as James Packer nursed his black eye in Melbourne, Gyngell was at work at the Nine Network, where he was receiving many messages of support.

Yesterday, Gyngell took responsibility for the stoush, releasing  a statement which said had he not turned up at Packer’s premises in an angry mood, then the confrontation would never have occurred,' the statement said.

'[Mr Gyngell] fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident. He respects the job police do and will co-operate fully with their investigation,' the statement said.

Packer, 46, and Gyngell, 47, who are childhood friends and were best man at one another's wedding, came to blows in the street outside Packer's luxury beach side apartment on Sunday afternoon.

The fight followed a heated text message exchange because Packer believed a camera crew from the network run by Gyngell was trying to catch him with rumoured lover, model Miranda Kerr.

Gyngell had gone to the $20million property in Sydney's Bondi Beach to reassure casino owner he was not under surveillance by Nine Network television cameras.

The pair immediately became embroiled in a profanity-laced argument which descended into blows.

Explosive pictures showed Packer in tracksuit pants and a bearded, bare-foot Gyngell pummeling each other repeatedly and wrestling on the ground before being pulled apart by a bodyguard.

Reports of the scuffle say Gyngell, the smaller of the two men, appeared to connect with Packer's eye in a left hook. Following the fight, Packer was seen walking off with his left eye puffy and his grey tracksuit pants marked with grass stains.

After emerging the following day with his black eye, Packer reported briefly for work, kept a meeting appointment with Seven Network boss, Kerry Stokes, and then flew to Melbourne on his private jet to escape scrutiny of an intense media scrum which had been tailing him since Monday.
