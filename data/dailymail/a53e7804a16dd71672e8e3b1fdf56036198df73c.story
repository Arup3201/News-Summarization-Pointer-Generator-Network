A Russian schoolboy has been filmed falling 100 feet to his death after accidentally grabbing a 30,000 volt electricity cable while making a free-climbing video.

The 14-year-old, identified only by the name 'Maxim', was climbing along the top of a railway bridge in the capital Moscow while a friend of the same age filmed his dangerous stunt.

After walking along the metal railing once, Maxim stops and walks towards the edge of the bridge to get a better view. However he appears to stumble and instinctively grabs the high voltage cable, which electrocutes him and causes him to fall on to the railway tracks below.

Transport police in Russia issued the disturbing video as a warning to others against performing dangerous stunts on railway lines in order to get pictures and video to put on social media.

Maxim had climbed onto the top of the railway bridge not far from Sheremetyevo International Airport in the Russian capital Moscow together with a friend also aged 14-years-old.

And as the second schoolboy videoed, Maxim crouched as he edged his way towards the end of the bridge and then turned round and slowly walked back, this time standing higher.

Seconds later he appears to lose his balance and instinctively grabs the 30,000 volt electricity cable in the hope of regaining his balance.

However a cloud of smoke is seen coming from the schoolboy's right hand as the current knocks him unconscious and causes him to tumble off the railing on to the railway tracks 100 feet below.

Plummet: Maxim's tragic death was captured on film by his 14-year-old schoolboy friend

Transport police spokeswoman Jana Vasilieva said: 'This was a tragic accident that cost a young man his life and illustrates the danger of trespassing on railway property.

'The incident is still being investigated though so we cannot say any more this stage.'

Video of the incident emerged on the same day a shocking video was released showing the moment passers-by refused to help a fatally injured young man who burst into flames while trying to steal copper wire from an electricity substation.

The unidentified South African, who appears to be in his teens, was seen with horrific burns covering most of his upper body following the incident in the outskirts of the city of Witbank. 

With his terrible injuries clearly visible, the young man says he is in agony and begs passers-by to take him to the hospital - but he is cruelly told to walk if he wants treatment. The burns victim then walked to a health clinic, where an ambulance was called, but he died several hours later.
