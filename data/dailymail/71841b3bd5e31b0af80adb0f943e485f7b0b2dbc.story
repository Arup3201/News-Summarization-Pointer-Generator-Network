French president Francois Hollande has been accused by one of his most senior political allies of running a 'paparazzi democracy' for ordering all ministers to publicly declare their wealth.

Claude Bartolone - the socialist leader of France's parliament - told the president: 'The French don't want everything we have put on display.'

While urban
 affairs minister Francois Lamy told France's Canal Plus television: 
'It's an outrage. Do you think the public would also like to see a 
picture of my wife in the nude?'

Mr Bartolone's defiant outburst on live radio after Mr Hollande told his entire cabinet to publish full details of their assets.

The sudden drive for complete financial transparency came after it emerged that an ex-cabinet member had hidden up to 12 million pounds from the tax-man in a Swiss bank.

The publication of wealth then sparked charges of hypocrisy when it was revealed there were six millionaires in the president's left-wing government.

Now Mr Bartolone has told RTL radio: 'The majority of French people don't want to live in a paparazzi democracy where everything is on show.

'There should be a way of protecting the private life of elected politicians while still maintaining controls.

'The Transparency Commission simply needs to have the power to investigate when there is doubt.

'The French people only need to be reassured that their MPs are honest and not using their positions to line their pockets.'

Other ministers also reacted with fury at being ordered to lay bare their personal finances to the public.

Following
 the 'voluntary' declarations earlier this month, a new law on financial
 transparency among ministers and other top officials is now set to be 
adopted by the summer.

The
 Cahuzac tax scandal came as a massive blow to the credibility of Mr 
Hollande, who made a key manifesto pledge to crack down on tax dodging.

The president hopes the declarations 
will restore faith in his flagging administration, but critics have 
accused him of knowing about and covering up Cahuzac's tax dodging and 
of mismanagement for having believed his denials.

Mr Bartolone's attack on his leader 
also comes as a new poll this week revealed Mr Hollande has become the 
most unpopular president in five decades.

His
 historically low approval rating of just 25 per cent of the population 
makes him even more unpopular than President Charles de Gaulle was in 
1968 - when millions of French rioted to demand a complete overhaul of 
French society.

Mr 
Hollande came to power in May 2012 amid a fanfare of promises to 
redistribute wealth and rebuild France's ailing public services.

But after eight months in the job, he has been humiliated by a catalogue of political, economic and personal crises and found himself unable to control either the public finances or the wayward antics of First Lady Valerie Trierweiler.

Millionaires have been fleeing France in fear of a proposed 75 per cent tax on all earnings over one million euros.

The French equivalent of the UK's Confederation of British Industry, called MEDEF, has warned the president that France risked becoming 'the poor man of Europe' over his 'disastrous' economic policies.

The latest economic data shows households' spending power has fallen for the first time since 1984, and that jobless figures rose for a 22nd straight month in March to 10.6 per cent - the highest level since 1997.

His girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler, 47, has also been the target of repeated media attacks since her boyfriend was elected president.

A spokesman for pollsters Ifop said: 'He claimed to be the Robin Hood president who would help the poor and sweep away the corruption of the Sarkozy years.

'But he has been hit on all sides, by the economy, his policies, corruption and personal attacks. No president has ever been re-elected after falling as low as this.'
