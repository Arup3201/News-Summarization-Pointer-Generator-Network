Bolton manager Neil Lennon has given up on signing Celtic forward Kris Commons this month.

The former Parkhead boss had hoped to use the uncertainty over the former Scotland international's future to his gain and lure Commons south.

But he has now ruled out a late January move after Celtic made it clear the out-of-contract attacker will not be sold in this transfer window.

Lennon told STV: 'Celtic have come out publicly and said he's not for sale, he won't be leaving and we haven't pursued that any further.

'I've got a great relationship with Celtic, a great relationship with Peter [Lawwell] and I don't want to damage that.

'People keep asking me about Kris and I feel uncomfortable talking about him because he is Celtic's player at the end of the day.'

Commons, was a central figure under Lennon, netting 31 goals in the Northern Irishman's final season in charge.

But under Ronnie Deila, he has been in and out of the side as he was forced to accept his position was not guaranteed.

However, Lennon believes Celtic should look to tap into more than just his playing abilities as he recommended the 31-year-old for a future coaching role with the Hoops.

Lennon said: 'It was something that myself and Peter talked about. Kris gets the club, he gets Celtic.

'He was having a great season last year and we talked about it in terms of working again together when his career finished. He's an intelligent boy, I think he'd have plenty to offer on the coaching side of things.

'I think he would be an asset for Celtic in a coaching capacity.'
