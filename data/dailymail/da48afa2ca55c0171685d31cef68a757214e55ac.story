Drunk: Police caught Tracey Chambers driving erratically after she had downed three bottles of wine

A jobless mother who drove while almost five and a half times the limit has walked free from court - despite giving the highest alcohol reading for a woman motorist ever recorded in Britain.

Tracey Chambers, 35, had already drunk three bottles of wine and was driving to buy more alcohol when police stopped her, a court heard.

She told officers she was driving to an off-licence and had left her young child at home.

She gave a breathalyser reading showing 188 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath - 5.4 times the legal limit of 35 micrograms.

It is the highest reading ever given by a woman in the UK, but Chambers was spared jail when she appeared at Northampton 
Magistrates' Court.

She was banned from driving for three years and given a 12-month probation supervision order with alcohol treatment.

Magistrates had heard how Chambers hit the bottle after 
losing her job almost four years ago. 

The court heard that Chambers was arrested on April 13 on suspicion of being unfit to drive whilst under the influence of drink or drugs.

Kim Dalton, prosecuting, said a 
policeman was attending a road accident in St James Road, 
Northampton, when he saw a Fiat Punto collide with a kerb near a pub.

He then saw the car’s headlights flash several times, and heard the driver attempt to restart the car.

Mrs
 Dalton said the officer went over to the car to speak to the driver and
 found Chambers slumped over the steering wheel smelling of alcohol.

She said: 'She was subsequently arrested. She protested, saying she couldn’t be arrested.

'It was then substantiated the defendant had left a child on their own.'

Mrs Dalton said Chambers had been verbally abusive while in police custody.

The prosecutor said: 'At interview, the defendant fully admitted she had been drink-driving.

'She said she couldn’t remember exactly how much she had drunk, possibly two bottles of wine.'

She later told police that it might have been three bottles.

Chambers pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to failing to provide a specimen.

Intoxicated: Chambers's reading of 188 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath is the highest ever recorded by a woman driver in Britain

The court heard that Chambers's breathalyser reading of 188 micrograms was given in a roadside test shortly after she was stopped by police.

Later the same night she gave another reading which showed she had 147 micrograms per 100ml.

She refused to provide another reading, which is a punishable offence.

Neil Clark, defending, said his client’s problems started when she was made redundant.

He
 said she had not been able to find work since then, had been struggling
 to make her mortgage payments, and had turned to alcohol when she 
became depressed.

Mr
 Clark said she had seen her doctor since the offence and had been admitted to St Mary’s Hospital in Kettering, Northamptonshire, for
 treatment.

She was no longer drinking alcohol and was working with a social worker, Mr Clark added.

Chambers's first breathalyser reading beats the previous record for a woman driver, set by Claire Louise Garrett in July 2010.

Garrett, from Hebburn, South Tyneside, gave a sample containing 179 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath after police stopped her for driving on the wrong side of the road.

Garrett pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol and received a three-year ban.

The highest alcohol level recorded by a male driver was 191 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath, given by Polish worker Marcin Ziebac, from Coudon, Coventry, in January 2010.
