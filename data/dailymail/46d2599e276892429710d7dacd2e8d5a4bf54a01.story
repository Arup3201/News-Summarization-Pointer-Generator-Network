Paul O'Grady has spoken out in support of soap actor Michael Le Vell, who was recently cleared of sex abuse charges

Comedian Paul O'Grady has thrown his support behind soap star Michael Le Vell, claiming the Coronation Street actor has been the victim of a 'witch hunt'.

Le Vell was cleared of child sex charges just two weeks ago and O'Grady, the presenter of ITV's For The Love Of Dogs, called the claims made against the TV veteran 'completely false'.

He also said prominent sports stars get away with shocking behaviour while TV stars are relentlessly pursued.

O'Grady said: 'It seems to be one rule for one and one rule for the other. If you’re a sportsperson you can get away with murder.

'You can get as many prossies and snort as much coke as you like and get paid billions a week.'

Instead of celebrities like Le Vell, O'Grady says 'villains' like corrupt bankers and politicians should be hounded.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'It’s shocking what they put him through and what they put his family through.

'That stigma, it’s the worst stigma. Imagine being accused of that? It’s dreadful, it’s completely falsified.'

After Mr Le Vell’s acquittal Mr Starmer spoke out in defence of the decision, saying: ‘It was a properly-brought case. The idea that if a case results in an acquittal it shouldn’t have been brought is wrong.’

Following the verdict, questions arose over whether the prosecution should have been brought at all after it emerged the case against Mr Le Vell was initially dropped by the CPS in January 2012 due to a lack of evidence.

Only following the intervention of Alison Levitt QC, principal legal adviser to Keir Starmer QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, in February did the CPS change their mind and authorise Greater Manchester Police to charge the actor.

Innocent: The Coronation Street star, 48, was cleared of rape and indecent assault

I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! bosses have reportedly told Michael Le Vell to stop drinking for two weeks, if he wants to be a £500,000 contestant on this year's show.

Self-confessed alcoholic Le Vell, 48, has to prove to ITV chiefs that he can resist a drink before they can put him in the jungle. During his trial he admitted to drinking up to 12 pints a night.

Corrie bosses have allegedly offered him a £200,000-a-year deal to come back after his character was last seen heading to Germany to look after his father who suffered a heart attack.

He is due to start filming in October, but then he would then jet off to the jungle to compete in I'm a Celebrity.
