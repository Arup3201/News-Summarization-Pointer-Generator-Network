Two shoppers are wanted by police after a $40,000 crocodile skin jacket was stolen from an exclusive Manhattan store.

Police have released CCTV images of the man and woman who were seen shopping at Zilli at about 5.30pm on December 3.

The pair, believed to be in their 20s, are suspected of taking the jacket without anyone in the store realizing.

The woman took the jacket from a display rack and handed it to the man, who took it into a fitting room, police say.

The male shopper is then suspected of putting the jacket in a bag before leaving the store.

Both were said to have been well dressed, according to the Daily News.

Staff at the store, where customers must ring a bell and wait to be allowed entry, are not thought to have been involved in the theft.

The suspected thieves were the only customers inside the store at the time the jacket was taken.

One employee told a New York Times reporter: 'There is much more to tell, but unfortunately I can't.'

The French menswear store specializes in fur and exotic leather goods, and only admits a handful of customers at a time.
