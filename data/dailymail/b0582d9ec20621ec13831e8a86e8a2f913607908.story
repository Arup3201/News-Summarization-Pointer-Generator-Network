The charity chief who defended six-figure salaries for executives at aid charities had his 60th birthday party paid for by donations.

Sir Stephen Bubb held a £1,500 reception for 90 guests in the House of Lords, where guests enjoyed afternoon tea.

But instead of footing the bill himself, Sir Stephen, head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo), got his employer to cover half the bill – £765 – despite the organisation being funded by charities.

Controversial: The charity chief ,  Sir Stephen Bubb, who defended six-figure salaries for executives at aid charities had his 60th birthday party paid for by donations

A picture posted on his personal blog shows him posing in front of two pink birthday cakes. Another shows guests in the Cholmondeley room, the most sought-after as it gives access to the terrace and views across the Thames.

Sir Stephen, who earns £100,000, wrote: ‘It seemed just right to celebrate my 60th with a tea party in the House of Lords.’

He added: ‘I even had a note from Ed Miliband to wish me well, though as he said “60; hard to believe it”. And a card from Tony and Cherie Blair. Tony’s nice note was rather touching “thanks for your fantastic contribution to the nation and its voluntary sector”.’

After the party on November 5 last year, guests went back to Sir Stephen’s London home for ‘champagne and fireworks’. He added that he was not retiring and would continue ‘challenging Government to do what is right and just’.

The event, which must be booked by a member, is in the name of Labour peer Baroness Gould of Potternewton, a former trade unionist. The cost for afternoon tea is £17 per person – £1,530 for 90 guests.

Charlie Elphicke, a Tory MP who site on the Public Administration Select Committee, said: ‘Spending charitable funds in this way seems highly inappropriate. These funds are donated to help people in need, not birthday bashes for the great and good.’

Fellow Conservative Priti Patel said: ‘Money held by charities should be used for charitable purposes, not for personal perks and parties.’

Earlier this week an investigation revealed a sharp rise in the number of executives on six-figure salaries at charities that distribute Britain’s foreign aid.

Save The Children’s chief executive Justin Forsyth was paid £163,000 last year, Sir Nicholas Young of the British Red Cross earned £184,000 and Dame Barbara Stocking of Oxfam £119,560.

While the head of the charity regulator William Shawcross said the revelations ‘risked bringing the charitable world into disrepute’, Sir Stephen hit back at him saying the focus on salaries was a ‘disgraceful distraction.’

In angry television and radio interviews, he said: ‘This simply isn’t an issue for donors. They are more concerned about the outcomes, the performance and the efficiency of these organisations.’

He said the earnings were ‘not excessive’ compared to those of bosses in the private and public sectors, and said the average charity chief executive was paid £58,000.

An Acevo spokesman said yesterday: ‘As part of its ongoing work in building stakeholder relationships, Acevo invited its members, parliamentarians and cabinet ministers, national media and other key partners to an event at the House of Lords to mark the 60th birthday of Acevo’s long-standing chief executive.

‘The Acevo board approved these arrangements and covered half the cost. Sir Stephen also asked family and friends to the event, so he paid half the cost personally.

The spokesman added: ‘This was a tea party, no alcohol was provided and Sir Stephen arranged his own birthday cake. It was an entirely fitting recognition of Sir Stephen’s outstanding contribution to the charity sector and a valuable contribution to Acevo’s work representing charities to Westminster.’
