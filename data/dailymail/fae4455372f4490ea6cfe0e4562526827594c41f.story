Here's a gallery that will go off with a bang in the art world.

Austrian-born photographer Sabine Pearlman created a series of intriguing images showing ammunitions that have been neatly cut in half.

Titled 'Ammo', the reveal the surprisingly varied and intricate contents inside.

Pearlman, who moved to Los Angeles in
 2004, shot 900 cross-sections of ammo found in a Second World War bunker in Switzerland last October.

The Otis College of Art and Design and Santa Monica College graduate documented the meticulous and dangerous beauty that lies beneath the bullets' casings.

Pearlman said: 'I was originally intrigued by the ambiguous nature of the subject matter.

'The cross-sections reveal a hidden 
complexity and beauty of form, which stands in vast contrast to the 
destructive purpose of the object.

'It is a representation of the evil and the beautiful, a reflection of the human condition.'

The ammo was cut in half by a munitions specialist who devised a technique to defuse the rounds before cutting them in half.

'It is a dangerous process, especially if you don’t know what you’re doing!,' warns Pearlman.
