With their pristine white sheets, carefully-arranged tea cups and attentive teams of young nurses, the ambulance trains which brought injured Tommies back from the front could not have been further from the horrors of war the men had lived through.

The insides of the specially-adapted train coaches were often the first taste of home the wounded soldiers experienced as they made their way back to Britain after months spent fighting in the trenches.

These remarkable images of the First World War ambulance trains are now to form part of a new exhibition at York's National Railway Museum in November.

The photos show the trains which brought soldiers back from the battlefield to the French ports of Calais and Bologne, where they were transferred onto boats before being taken, again by train, to hospitals throughout Britain.

But, as the exhibition will reveal, the images contrast with some reports from the time. War poet Robert Grave described his journey in one of the carriages as a 'nightmare' in his war memoir, Goodbye To All That, and a nurse documented their 'frightful smells and dirt'.

As the numbers of those injured in battle rose, so the trains became more important and were upgraded and expanded during the conflict, leading the same nurse to later comment they had become 'a joy after the tragedy' for those unfortunate enough to need them.

The exhibition, marking the centenary of the War this year, will feature a series of images, sketches and personal accounts of the vital role of the railways during it and other conflicts.

Each coach of the train was designated as a 'ward' and contained thirty-six beds in tiers of three. The middle bed folded back to enable sitting patients to use the lower bunk

Dedicated teams of nurses tended the soldiers. One described in her diary how a group of soldiers had been 'picked up without a spot of dressing on any of their wounds'. She added: 'The matron, a medical officer, and some of them got hold of some dressings and went round doing what they could in the tie, and others fed them'

Trains transported troops through northern France before others brought them to hospitals from ports in Dover and Southampton. This photo shows members of the public waiting to view a touring ambulance train at an exhibition at Bradford Exchange station in 1916

A 'standard' ambulance train consisted of sixteen cars, including a pharmacy car, two kitchens, a personnel car and a brake and stores van

The first ever hospital train, the Princess Christian, was built and transported to South Africa to be used during the Boer War during 1899-1902.

The train supplied the wounded with clothing and toiletries and transported more than 7,000 seriously injured to Cape Town.

In the 
First World War, the UK Flour Millers' Association presented the Red 
Cross with two ambulance trains, specially built and equipped, 
constructed by Great Western and Eastern Railways.

The trains were working in France during 1915, with another train, converted from ordinary French rolling stock, and carried 461,844 patients.

It was then decided that a number of 'standard' trains should be built by various British railway companies to War Office specifications, and altogether thirty were eventually sent to the military forces overseas, mostly in France and Flanders.

Boulogne, France, was the principle port for embarkation for the wounded and on one occasion it took only nineteen minutes to unload 123 casualties from a train.

The main disembarkation points in the UK were Dover and Southampton. During the war years, Dover dealt with 1,260,506 casualties, unloaded 4076 boats and loaded 7781 ambulance trains.

The patients were then sent by one of the twenty 'home standard' ambulance trains, or by an emergency ambulance train, to a receiving station, where they were transferred to road vehicles, usually by volunteer first aiders, which took them to their destination hospital.

There were 196 receiving stations in the UK including York, where the National Railway Museum, which is hosting the exhibition, is based.

Ambulance trains were also used during the Second World War in England and Scotland to transfer the wounded to the many temporary and permanent UK Military Hospitals for further recuperation and treatment.

The main train line companies actively helped the Army, Navy, and RAF with supply and conversion of the ambulance trains and during the Second World War this was sanctioned by the Railway Executive Committee.

By the time of the Second World War there were about 30 ambulance trains in operation. Each carriage was painted with a red cross on white background on the roof and side so that enemy planes would identify them as hospital trains and not troop or supply trains.

Under the Geneva Convention this prevented them becoming a legitimate target.

The trains could accommodate about 400 lying and sitting patients, in addition to the medical personnel and train crew

The trains often generated their own electricity for lighting and driving overhead fans and all cars were steam heated

In a book from the museum's archive, a nurse describes one experience in 'an anonymous diary of nursing sister on western front', as pretty horrendous. She wrote: 'They got their Amiens wounded into cattle trucks on mattresses with convent pillows, and have a twenty hours' journey with them in frightful smells and dirt. They'd been traveling already for two days'

The same nurse (not pictured) went on to describe a completely different experience when the trains were fully converted. She said: '(The soldiers) sit up talking and smoking till late, because they are so surprised and pleased to be alive'

It's hard to know if you're alive or deadWhen steel and fire go roaring through your head.One moment you'll be crouching at your gunTraversing, mowing heaps down half in fun:The next, you choke and clutch at your right breast -No time to think - leave all - and off you go ...To Treasure Island where the Spice winds blow,To lovely groves of mango, quince and lime -Breathe no good-bye, but ho, for the Red West!It's a queer time.You're charging madly at them yelling "Fag!"When somehow something gives and your feet drag.You fall and strike your head; yet feel no painAnd find... you're digging tunnels through the hayIn the Big Barn, 'cause it's a rainy day.Oh, springy hay, and lovely beams to climb!You're back in the old sailor suit again.It's a queer time.

Or you'll be dozing safe in your dug-out -A great roar - the trench shakes and falls aboutYou're struggling, gasping, struggling, then... hullo!Elsie comes tripping gaily down the trench,Hanky to nose - that lyddite makes a stench -Getting her pinafore all over grime.Funny! because she died ten years ago!It's a queer time.The trouble is, things happen much too quick;Up jump the Boches, rifles thump and click,You stagger, and the whole scene fades away:Even good Christians don't like passing straightFrom Tipperary or their Hymn of HateTo Alleluiah-chanting, and the chimeOf golden harps... and... I'm not well today...It's a queer time.

Alison Kay, assistant archivist at the National Railway Museum, said: 'With the 2014 centenary approaching, our archive and library collections delve even deeper into the story of the First World War ambulance train to reveal what it would have really been like for patients, doctors and nurses to travel this way during wartime'

Miss Kay added: 'Our archives contain drawings of fittings, fixtures and layouts providing an insight into what it would really be like for those who lived on the train day-in, day-out, which is a useful tool when wading through wartime morale-boosting propaganda'
