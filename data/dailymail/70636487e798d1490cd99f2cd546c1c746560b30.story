Andrew Strauss insists that it is a 'good thing to have conflict' in a team - as long as the whole side are 'united by a common purpose'.

The former England captain's comments come in the wake of allegations made by Kevin Pietersen in his explosive book, KP: The Autobiography, of 'bullying' in the national side.

But Strauss believes it is a 'myth' that all successful sides are fully harmonious and act like the characters in The Waltons - an American television series based around a family who all get along well and achieve a positive outcome from a difficult situation as a result.

The 37-year-old, speaking to London Loves Business, said: 'Sometimes I think there’s this myth that all teams need to get on brilliantly, a kind of Waltons myth - that you need to be like the Waltons if you want to perform well as a team - but that couldn’t be further from the truth. 

'You actually want a degree of conflict at times - you want people to feel comfortable enough to say their opinion.

'Conflict is a good thing as long as it’s well-meaning and it’s all coming from a starting point of: "how do we get better and how do we improve?"'

Despite advocating the benefits of having strong personalities and a degree of conflict in the dressing room, Strauss insists there must be 'a common purpose' to unite the side.

'I’m looking forward to reading the full KP book. Might bully my kids into getting it for me for Xmas!! Obvs sad to see the accusations against me and I WILL have my right of reply! However today is not the day and Twitter is not the place!'

GEOFF MILLER, Former England selector

'There was no atmosphere of bullying within the England set-up. What we tried to do was pick the best squad to create the best atmosphere to win matches.'

GRAEME SWANN

'It’s codswallop...We had a magnificent team ethos and team spirit until Mitchell Johnson took his blindfold off and then it all fell apart …He has picked on people who he thinks can’t answer back.'

GARY LINEKER @GaryLineker

'The weather at my #FFLGolfDay is horrendous! I blame Andy Flower.'

JONATHAN AGNEW

'Pietersen claims Flower had it in for him for attempting to have him sacked in 2008. But Flower brought Pietersen back into the team following the scandal over texts to South Africans.'

CHRIS TREMLETT @ChrisTremlett

'Glad KP has finally been able to give his side of the story. People can now make an informed opinion of what went on.'

MICHAEL VAUGHAN @MichaelVaughan

'Many to blame but mostly a lack of communication and man-management. I will remember KP for what he was. A maverick who could play innings that no other England player could!'

Pietersen and Strauss celebrate the latter's century in 2012 against West Indies at Trent Bridge

Pietersen alleges in his book that senior players - including Matt Prior, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann - intimidated their England team-mates by berating them if they dropped a catch or mis-fielded.

And Strauss, who scored 21 centuries in 100 Tests between 2004 and 2012, insists that all members of an international side must pull in the same direction if they are to be successful.

The ex-Middlesex batsman, who averaged 40.91 in Tests for England, added: 'You want (team members) to be very united by a common purpose, and my philosophy was that as long as people were moving in the right direction, as long as they weren’t undermining our team environment, then I’d like to work with anyone. If they are undermining the team environment it’s a problem.'
