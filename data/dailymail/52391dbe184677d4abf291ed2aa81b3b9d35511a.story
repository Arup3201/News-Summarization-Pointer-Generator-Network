'Gangster's moll': Gemma Harvieu is accused of money laundering and assisting an offender

A Selfridges beautician enjoyed a jet-set lifestyle with a fugitive armed robber after he escaped from his own trial and set up base on the Costa Del Sol, a court heard yesterday.

Gemma Harvieu, 29, became a 'gangster's moll' to Andrew Moran, who was on trial for robbing a Royal Mail van at gunpoint when he vaulted over the dock and managed to give police the slip.

The court heard that during his four years on the run, Harvieu would join him at a string of exotic locations, before he was dramatically arrested by Spanish police while sunbathing at his villa.

In the space of just one year she made 23 visits to Alicante, jurors heard. She also took trips to Paris, Vienna, Pisa, skied in the Alps and would shop on London's Bond Street.

All the while she was earning a modest wage on the cosmetics counter of Selfridges at the Trafford Centre, Manchester, Preston Crown Court heard.

Harvieu, who is accused of assisting an offender and money laundering, was allegedly involved in a scheme where she would wire money to Spain via Western Union, where Moran, 31, collected it using an assortment of false identities.

Before Moran escaped she was depositing only £7,000 a year in her personal account, but police investigations showed that she banked more than £22,000 - allegedly to help fund his life on the run.

Harvieu, from Chorlton, Manchester, was with Moran at this exclusive Villa on May 10 this year when Moran and Harvieu were caught when police swooped on an exclusive villa in Alicante.

Armed officers found firearms, live ammunition, mobile phones and evidence of false identities.

'This just wasn’t some rich boyfriend she had picked up in Spain who was treating her to a celebrity lifestyle In the Costa Del Sol away from her life back in Manchester,' said prosecutor Tim Brennand prosecuting.

'There was much much more to this. Moran was very much living the clichéd lifestyle of a resident of the so-called Costa Del Crime, and the inference is she was living out a life effectively as a gangster’s moll.

'The couple were spending time with one another. It is inconceivable that she was ignorant of the life she had chosen for herself with Moran. She was inextricably linked to his flight from justice and criminal lifestyle.'

Moran had gone on the run in March 2009 as he was standing trial over a £25,000 gunpoint raid on a Royal Mail delivery van.

Realising he was about to be remanded in custody at Burnley Crown Court, he vaulted over the dock and ran out into the street before officer had the time to take hold of him.

He later fled the UK after he used a false passport to buy a ticket for a Monarch Airlines flight to Alicante.

But whilst police were hunting Moran, from December 2009 to May 2011 Harvieu flew 22 times with Monarch from Manchester to Alicante- sometimes twice a month - allegedly to see him.

In 2010 she flew to Alicante 23 times with some of the flights paid for by Moran, his sister and his friends. She would arrive back in the UK after trips only to return shortly after by Eurostar.

A European arrest warrant was issued for Moran in 2010 and in November 2012 Spanish police set a road block to trap him.

But Moran spotted the officers in uniform, rammed his 4x4 car through the police cordon and drove off in the wrong direction away from the trap set for him.

Police searched his flat and found firearms, cash, drugs and false identities were seized but the trail went cold until he was tracked down to the villa in Alicane with Harvieu.

Mr Brennand added: 'He was using a variety of false passports, and mobile phones and they were enjoying the high life. Photos showed a variety of cars and motorcycles and Andrew Moran posing with weapons.

'It demonstrates more about the brazen personality of Andrew Moran and a fascination for ammunition and drugs and that he had done very well for himself after leaving the dock at Burnley Crown Court.'

Police analysed Harvieu’s Halifax Ultimate Reward Current Account and spoke to work colleagues who said she had no longer wanted to work at Selfridges after meeting a man in Spain.

Between March 2009 and November 2012 a total of £38,930 in cash deposits were made including cash payments totalling £22,335 in 2010.

She was entrusted to send money to allocated names in five transactions totalling £4,000 between November 2010 and 7 December 2010 all being collected in Spain.

Mr Brennand said: 'The cash lodgements were the sort that would not trigger money-laundering alarm bells. It was deposit after deposit after deposit.

'The location was consistent, we can see spending in shops, establishments in Manchester, Bond Street in London and locations in Spain and Europe where money is going in and out of the UK.

The court heard Harvieu denies ever knowing Moran was a fugitive or a criminal - even though his escape was reported in newspapers and on BBC’s Crimewatch programme.

Mr Brennand said: ’The television is a funny thing, when it touches you the natural thing we do is tell friends, family, you tell anybody and everybody you possibly can.

'Looking at their relationship, it is simply inconceivable that she was not aware of who he was or what he was. Applying commonsense she would have discovered the truth.'

Harvieu denies assisting an offender and money laundering. The trial continues.
