Smiling: But Ed and David Miliband are still at odds with claims that friends of Ed have been 'banned' from David's farewell party

The feud between the Miliband brothers was reignited last night over claims that friends of Labour leader Ed have been ‘banned’ from a farewell bash as David starts a new life in America.

Invitations to a champagne party in London’s West End have been sent to all Labour MPs who voted for David when he was narrowly beaten by Ed in the party leadership contest in 2010. But MPs who backed the younger sibling claim they have been left off the list. The snub illustrates the continuing hostility between the rival factions of Blairite David and his Brownite brother.

One ally of Ed said: ‘It is a typical act of pettiness by David. It shows exactly why he lost the Labour leadership to Ed – he has no idea how to treat his colleagues with respect.’

A Labour MP who voted for Ed added: ‘Judging by those who have got invites and those who haven’t, they have gone down a list of those who voted for David and invited them and scrubbed the rest of us off. To exclude people because they did not vote for you three years ago is stupid.

‘It is time to bury the hatchet, but David can never bring himself to do it.’

Embarrassingly for Ed, most Labour MPs have been invited, since the majority supported his brother in 2010. Ed’s victory depended on his overwhelming support from union barons. Few union officials have been invited to the bash.

The party is being organised by three leading Blairite figures: former Home Secretary Alan Johnson, who backed David’s leadership campaign, Labour frontbencher and former  television presenter Gloria De Piero and ex-Labour General Secretary Siobhan McDonagh.

The event is being held in an upmarket bar in London’s Oxford Circus on July 9. It will feature speeches highlighting David Miliband’s record as Tony Blair’s head of policy and later, Foreign Secretary. One of the party organisers said they did not know if Ed Miliband had been invited. The Labour leader’s office said he had been – and would attend.

Relations between the two brothers have not recovered from the acrimonious race to succeed Gordon Brown. David’s wife, musician Louise, is said to have remained ‘frosty’ towards Ed’s wife, Justine, ever since. The row is said to have caused so much friction that they have not attended each other’s children’s birthday parties.

In the wake of his failed bid,  David’s allies urged him to stay on in politics and plot his revenge in the hope that Ed would make a mess of the job and be forced to step down.

But, despite low personal ratings, there is little appetite among Labour MPs to change the party leader. And David, whose image never recovered from posing with a banana in one hand, became a peripheral figure in Parliament.

Earlier this year, he abandoned all hope of replacing his brother and decided to quit the Commons and move to America as head of the New York-based International Rescue Committee.

His £300,000-a-year salary is nearly five times higher than his wage as a Labour MP. He will also get a plush office near New York’s Grand Central Station, complimentary private health care, a tax-free pension and a host of other perks.

David will be responsible for humanitarian projects with 12,000 staff and an annual budget of £240 million. The IRC’s money comes mainly from public grants – including £110 million of British aid over the past ten years.
