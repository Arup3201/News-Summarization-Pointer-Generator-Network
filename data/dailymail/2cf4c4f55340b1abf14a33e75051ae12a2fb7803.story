Supermarket giant Morrisons has been forced to apologise to a mother after asking her to breastfeed her baby in the disabled toilets, which she described as 'grubby and dirty'.

Michelle Garner, 31, was stunned when staff at her local store in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts., told her she should feed her six-week-old daughter Lois in the supermarket washroom.

The mother-of-two said she was shopping with her baby on Wednesday afternoon when she approached a senior member of staff.

After asking if there was somewhere she could feed her baby she was advised by the Morrisons worker to use the disabled toilet.

But when she reluctantly got there, Michelle found there was not even a toilet seat in the 'grubby and dirty' cubicle and stormed out of the store in tears.

Today Michelle said she was left feeling like an outcast following the 'humiliating' incident.

She said: 'I was really upset. I felt like an outcast and really embarrassed.

'There wasn’t even a lid on the toilet, it was dirty and very grubby.

'I would have breastfed in the cafe, but the chairs are welded to the tables and there just wasn’t enough room.

'The staff were short with me, and it really made me feel upset.

'So I went and sat in the car. It really upset me and I felt completely humiliated.'

Michelle, who also has a 12-year-old son, said she could not understand why Morrisons could not offer breast feeding facilities while other supermarkets did.

Her husband Bryan, 34, added: 'Post-natal depression is one thing I’m very aware of and it’s incidents like this which can trigger bad feelings in mums.'

To vent her frustration she took to Facebook and complained about what had happened to her on a local breastfeeding mothers' network page.

She received so much support that a group of a dozen mothers visited the store yesterday afternoon to publicly breastfeed their children in protest.

One mother Claire Bradford, 37, of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Notts., who fed her two-and-a-half-year old son Charlie Moore at the store, said: 'It’s disgraceful what has happened to Michelle, and we shouldn’t stand for it.

'They were in the wrong and they need to change their policy.'

A Morrisons spokesperson said: 'We’re sorry for what happened yesterday - the options offered to the customer to breastfeed her baby were not good enough.

'We welcome mums and their babies in our store and we know that it’s important to offer every assistance to make them comfortable.

'We will be ensuring that all colleagues at the store understand what support we expect them to offer breastfeeding mums.'
