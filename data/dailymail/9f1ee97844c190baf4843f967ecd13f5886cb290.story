Donetsk has been the scene of fierce clashes between separatist factions loyal to Moscow and Ukrainian government forces. Intense fighting was reported today at the city's airport. 

A total of 23 troops were said to have been killed during an attempt to regain control of eastern regions close to the city.

In the worst incident, 19 soldiers were killed in a multiple rocket attack staged by insurgents close to the Russian border. A further 93 soldiers sustained 'wounds and contusions of varying severity'.

Rockets were fired from a Grad missile launcher nearly 10 miles away, Ukraine's Defence Ministry said.

The operating base was located near one of three border crossings whose closure Russian officials had announced Friday.

Military 
spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov said: 'While performing special 
assignments in various regions where the active phase of anti-terrorist 
operations is underway, 23 servicemen from the Ukrainian armed forces 
and state border service were killed.'

President Poroshenko said that Kiev would 'find and destroy' the 
pro-Russian separatists responsible for a high-powered missile attack.

'For
 every soldier's life, the militants will pay with scores and hundreds 
of their own. Not a single terrorist will avoid responsibility, each 
will get what they deserve,' he said in a statement on his website 
following an emergency meeting of security chiefs.

The
 heavy toll is a major blow after Ukraine's forces appeared to be 
gaining ground against insurgents who Kiev alleges are funded and 
supplied by Moscow.

Ukrainian government troops have been fighting for more than three months against separatists in eastern Ukraine.

In
 the last two weeks, however, they have cut the territory held by the 
rebels in half and forced them out of their stronghold in the city of 
Slovyansk.

But
 the rebels have since regrouped in Donetsk, an industrial city 
of 1 million, and Ukraine has vowed to cordon the area.

Ukraine's
 Defense Ministry said the troops struck in Friday's attack had been 
trying to secure the porous border with Russia, which Ukraine says has 
been crossed by large numbers of militants transporting armored vehicles
 and weapons.

Border
 crossings are of particular concern to both sides. Ukraine says Russia 
is supporting and arming the rebels, but Russia denies the charges. The 
rebels have captured a few of the border crossings and Ukraine has 
demanded them back.

Britain is among countries arguing for tougher sanctions against Moscow over the dispute.

Ukraine is resisting pressure from Russia and the West to begin a new ceasefire in the conflict with separatists.

Earlier this week rebel leader Gubarev said he
 was losing hope that Russian forces would intervene in the fighting 
blaming Russian tycoons for dissuading Moscow from military 
intervention.

Gubarev
 also said there is a split in rebel ranks and that his organization no 
longer controls the murky Vostok Battalion of fighters who man key 
checkpoints on the outskirts of the Donetsk region's capital city.

Gubarev said: 'We would like to receive help in the form of Russian forces. But we are realists and understand that's impossible.'

Rebels in the Donetsk region and the adjacent Luhansk region have repeatedly called for Russia to send in 'peacekeeping' troops as the fight against them intensifies.

Russia has shown no inclination to do so, and officials have said that a peacekeeping mission could take place only with U.N. authorization.

Gubarev suggested that Russian tycoons are opposed to military action, fearing their businesses would be affected.

Russia already has been hit with Western sanctions for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March and for allegedly fomenting the unrest in eastern Ukraine, in which more than 400 people have reportedly been killed.

Sending forces into Ukraine would almost certainly prompt even harsher sanctions.

'Their selfish interests are understandable,' Gubarev said.

Gubarev vowed that his group would stand up to any attempt by Ukrainian forces to take the city.

'There is nowhere to retreat to,' he said. 'For us, it's either victory of death.'

Hundreds of people have been abducted and tortured in eastern Ukraine, according to human rights group Amnesty International.

While the vast majority of allegations have been levelled against separatist pro-Russian 
groups, pro-Kiev forces, including self-defence groups, have also been 
implicated in the ill-treatment of captives.

Victims are said to include police, 
business people, activists, protesters, journalists, politicians, 
activists, members of electoral business people.

In one disturbing case a young female pro-Kiev activist was savagely beaten and slashed with a knife before being made to write separatist slogan in her own blood

Hanna, a pro-Kiev activist who had provided first aid to protesters at demonstrations, said she was abducted by armed men in the eastern city of Donetsk on 27 May.

She was held for six days before being released in a prisoner exchange. She described how she was violently interrogated.

'My face was smashed, he punched me in the face with his fist, he was trying to beat me everywhere, I was covering myself with my hands… I was huddled in the corner, curled up in a ball with my hands around my knees.

'He was angry that I was trying to protect myself. He went out and came back with a knife.'

Hanna showed scars on her neck, arms and legs where she was sliced with the blade. There is a stab wound in her knee, her right index finger is still heavily bandaged in a plastic splint.

She also described how her interrogator made her write a separatist slogan on the wall in her own blood.

Amnesty’s research team travelled from Kiev to the south-eastern sea port of Mariupol which has 'changed hands' twice in the last two months.

On 13 June Ukrainian forces took back control of the city from an armed group calling itself the Donetsk People’s Republic.

One local government official in Mariupol, who wished to remain anonymous, told Amnesty how they heard a captive separatist fighter wailing in pain at the hands of pro-Kiev forces who were seemingly trying to extract information about the separatists.

Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty’s Deputy Director of Europe and Central Asia, said: 'With hundreds abducted over the last three months, the time has come to take stock of what has happened, and stop this abhorrent ongoing practice.

'The bulk of the abductions are being perpetrated by armed separatists, with the victims often subjected to stomach-turning beatings and torture. There is also evidence of a smaller number of abuses by pro-Kiev forces.

'Now that pro-Kiev forces are re-establishing control over Slavyansk, Kramatorsk and various other places in eastern Ukraine, new captives are being released almost daily with an increasing number of disturbing cases emerging.

'It is time that these are meticulously documented with perpetrators brought to justice and victims awarded compensation.'
