A car linked to the disappearance of two teenagers last seen in 1978 has been pulled from a Florida canal.

The 1969 Dodge - possibly a Coronet model - was recovered from Sunrise canal, just north of State Road 84, on Thursday.

It is thought to belong to Harry Wade Atchison III, who went missing aged 19 along with his girlfriend Dana Null on the evening of October 7, 1978, in Fort Lauderdale, after they'd attended a rock concert.

However, authorities said that no bodies were found inside the vehicle, which is now virtually unrecognizable.

It was found by dredgers working for South Florida Management, according to ABC News.

Atchison, who went by his middle name, was heard violently arguing with Ms Null at his trailer in the 13300 block of southwest Fifth Court on the night in question, according to missing persons charity site Charleyproject.org.

It said that he drove off on his own, but that Ms Null chased after him and climbed into the car.

That was the last time they, or the car, were seen.

Atchison's parents were away at the time so there was a delay in him being reported missing.

He attended Miramar High School and Ms Null went to Plantation High School when they disappeared.

Charleyproject revealed that there are no photographs of Atchison available and that the original missing persons report is now lost.
