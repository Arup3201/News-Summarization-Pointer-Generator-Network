Atletico Madrid are maintaining an interest in Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo.

The Spanish striker scored 23 goals for the Premier League club following his £20m move from Seville last summer.

In demand: Alvaro Negredo has been linked with a move back to Spain

However, the 28-year-old is reportedly unhappy in England after struggling to settle in Manchester. 

Atletico could offer Negredo an escape route back to Spain and have money to spend with Diego Costa poised to sign for Chelsea.

Diego Simeone will be keen to fill the void left by Costa as they bid to defend their La Liga title.
