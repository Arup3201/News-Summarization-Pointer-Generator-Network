Three Greek gypsies have been arrested on suspicion of child abduction days after another Roma couple were charged with abducting a girl known as 'Maria'.

The Roma were arrested today on the Aegean island of Lesvos, with police saying the trio allegedly tried to register the two-month-old boy as their own.

Suspicions were raised because they lacked sufficient documentation.

Regional police chief Panagiotis 
Kordonouris said a 19-year-old woman, 21-year-old man and his 
51-year-old mother were arrested at a settlement outside the island's 
capital, Mytilini.

He told Associated Press they claimed an unknown Roma woman gave them the baby in Athens.

'They told us they didn’t give her any money, and that they met by accident,' he said.

'She told her that she had five children; they said that they are unable to have their own and asked if she could give her one.'

Last
 week, a Roma couple in the mainland town of Farsala was charged with 
abducting the girl known as 'Maria' found living with them.

The discovery triggered an international investigation for a possible match with children declared missing as well as an investigation in Greece to check for birth certificate fraud committed in the past six years.

The couple, aged 39 and 40, told police and prosecutors they had received the blond girl from a destitute Bulgarian woman and had brought her up with their own five children.

They have been charged with abduction and document fraud, and have been jailed awaiting trial.

The international police agency Interpol said it has not matched any cases to the DNA of the girl, who has been placed in temporary care with a Greek charity, Smile of the Child.

'The child is not on any list of missing children, so we believe this clearly demonstrates that this is not a case of kidnapping,' the couple’s lawyer Marietta Palavra told private Skai television.

'All the evidence that is emerging is providing confirmation of what my clients have been saying from the very first moment.'
