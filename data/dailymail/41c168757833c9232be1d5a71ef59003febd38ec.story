Leicester City players were given a helping hand before their stunning victory over Manchester United by Buddhist monks, who blessed them at the King Power Stadium.

Scorers David Nugent and Jamie Vardy wore necklaces featuring Buddha figures after their 5-3 win and manager Nigel Pearson greeted the men in orange warmly, saying: ‘You can come every week!’

The club’s Thai owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, has flown in monks from the Far East previously to attend the training ground and conduct ceremonies.

Striker David Nugent also netted in the 5-3 win against United and wore a similar necklace post-match

A week before the season, a marquee was erected at Leicester’s ground, where a blessing was given. The team have not lost since in home matches against Everton, Arsenal and United.

The players are happy to partake, and visited the Phra Maha Mondop Buddhist temple in Bangkok as they celebrated their Championship title win in May. ‘The Buddhist monks have been in,’ said Nugent after Leicester rose to eighth in the table. 

‘I hope we’ll see them more often.’

The Buddhist events, in which rituals are chanted and candles are lit, are intended to bring positive karma.

So far, so good…
