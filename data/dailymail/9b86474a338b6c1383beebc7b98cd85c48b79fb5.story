A devoted grandmother died from cervical cancer after her GP repeatedly dismissed her symptoms as the menopause.

Cheryl Humpage, 55, died in July 2010 after huge tumours spread - despite her undergoing an aggressive course of chemotherapy. 

Almost 18 months earlier in February 2008, the grandmother-of-three and former factory worker sought medical help after complaining of nausea, unusual bleeding and fever.

Her GP, Dr Martin Crowther, of St Peter's Surgery in Walsall, West Midlands, dismissed her symptoms as the menopause and she was prescribed HRT.

Cheryl Humpage saw her GP several times complaining of nausea, unusual bleeding and fever - all well-documented symptoms of cervical cancer.  By the time she was diagnosed, it was too late to save her

February 15, 2008 - Mrs Humpage first visited her GP complaining of fever, vomiting and aching. He gave her painkillers and suggested it was probably the menopause.

February 22, 2008 - She returned to the GP as her symptoms had not improved. He offered a course of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) but she did not want it.

September 2008 - Mrs Humpage had been experiencing having heavy bleeding so went back to see the GP again. This time he prescribed HRT.

February 23, 2009 - After another visit, she was finally referred for a scan at Walsall Manor Hospital.

March 5, 2009 - Mrs Humpage underwent an ultrasound which highlighted a large tumour on her ovary. She was admitted to City hospital as an emergency.

April 19, 2009 - The primary cancer is found to be on her cervix and she is referred for chemotherapy

July 26, 2010 - Mrs Humpage dies aged 55.

But her symptoms persisted and despite being examined by Dr Crowther a further three times, she was not diagnosed with cancer until a year later.

In March 2009, doctors finally diagnosed her with cancer after she was referred to a specialist at Walsall Manor Hospital but it was too late to save her and she died four months later.

Today her devastated husband Peter, 56, received a five-figure compensation pay-out from the GP's insurers after suing Dr Crowther for medical negligence.

Mr Humpage said: 'Cheryl was very concerned about her symptoms but she thought she was in safe hands.

'She was a great mum and grandmother and very family orientated, we're all absolutely heartbroken that she's no longer with us.

'It's very hard not to be angry about what happened. Cheryl should not have had to suffer like she did and if the cancer had been diagnosed earlier we believe we could have had longer with her.

'We just hope that what happened to Cheryl acts as a reminder to all of us about the importance of a quick diagnosis of cervical cancer.

'It is however still difficult to come to terms with out loss because we have never had any sort of apology or admission of responsibility to help us draw a line under everything that happened.

'Until then, I'm not sure that we can ever truly move forward.'

Dr Crowther today apologised for failing to detect Mrs Humpage's cancer. He said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere sympathy to Mrs Humpage's family for their loss.

'I am sorry for the delay in making a diagnosis. I
 have reflected extensively on the episode and discussed it with 
colleagues and I have learned from this process, now being more aware of
 the danger in similar situations.'

A year after Mrs Humpage's symptoms appeared she was finally referred to a specialist at Walsall Manor Hospital (pictured), where she was diagnosed with incurable cancer

Lindsay Tomlinson, from Irwin Mitchell Solicitors, who represented the family, said: 'This is a tragic case that has left a family devastated by the loss of a wife, mother and grandmother.

'During out investigations an independent medical expert found that Cheryl's GP should have recognised her symptoms as typical of those experienced by cervical cancer sufferers.

'Any yet no pelvic examination was made, she was not referred to a gynaecologist and no advice was given advising her to return for further medical attention should the bleeding continue.

'Had she been referred earlier she would have avoided such a long period of pain and suffering without a diagnosis and our expert was of the opinion that on balance she would have lived for longer and had more time with her family.'

Ms Tomlinson added that if her cancer had been picked up earlier, her suffering would have been 'greatly reduced and it was 'incredibly hard for all her family to see her deteriorate so quickly'. 

About 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK and it is most common in sexually active women aged between 25 and 45.

The symptoms of aren't always obvious and the disease may not cause any symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage.

In most cases, abnormal bleeding is the first sign. Its usually occurs after sex although any usually bleeding should be investigated.

Other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex, an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine.

If the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including constipation, blood in the urine, loss of bladder control, bone pain, a loss of appetite and a lack of energy.

Because of routine screening in the UK it is usually picked up in the precancerous stage. Therefore it is recommended that all women between the ages of 25 and 49 are screened for cervical cancer every three years.

Women aged between 50 and 64 are offered screening every five years.
