A two-year-old boy who was left fighting for his life after a gust of wind from Hurricane Sandy caused a tree limb to fall and hit his head has just undergone emergency surgery.

Tripp Halstead, from Georgia, has been hospitalized since the October 29 incident after sustaining a brain injury which left him in a medically induced coma.

His family posted on his Facebook page today: 'Please pray pray pray. They are taking him in for emergency surgery to remove the shunt and the pump.

'Tripp has bacterial meningitis, which is very life threatening. Words can’t describe what we are feeling except total heartbreak.'

Fighting for his life: Both sides of two-year-old Tripp Halstead's brain were injured when a large branch was blown off a tree and hit him in the head

When he was rushed into Children’s 
Healthcare of Atlanta on the day of the incident, he had emergency 
surgery to relive swelling around his brain from where the ten-foot tree
branch struck him on the head.

Tripp’s favorite toy, Lightning McQueen, is in his hand as he remains unconscious.

A family friend set up a Facebook for Tripp's parents, Bill and Stacy Halstead, who have been posting updates on their son's condition and asking people to pray and donate money for his recovery. 

The family said they have been overwhelmed with support from thousands of well-wishers, many of them strangers who have heard about Tripp’s plight from media reports, according to Atlanta Journal Constitution.

After the accident, the toddler's father, Bill Halstead, wrote that doctors gave them sobering news.

'His injury is across both sides of the brain which makes it much worse. It is still far too early to know what the outcome will be or what the lasting damage could be,' the message read.

'His swelling is back up and his drainage tube is having problems,' the post said in part. 'Sounds like today is going to be the most trying day so far so please continue to pray. We still need a miracle.'

The boy's mother, Stacy Halstead, called her son a miracle baby, explaining to WSB-TV that she and her husband had struggled for a long time to conceive until finally she became pregnant with Tripp, their one and only child.

On October 29, tragedy struck when the toddler was playing at around 11.30am outside the Cribs and Crayons day care center, CBS Atlanta reported. 

A strong gust of wind caused a tree limb to fall, hitting the little boy in the neck and head. Employees from the center rushed to his aid and administered CPR, but the damage had been done.

Heavy: A strong gust of wind ripped the branch from the tree before it landed on Tripp

Since the accident, the boy's family have been on a roller coaster ride, going from positive signs, like a brief reduction in pressure around his brain, to serious complications, among them problems with his breathing. 

On Friday afternoon, a desperate plea appeared on the family's Faceboook page asking for prayers. 

'Please Please Please Pray for a miracle and if we can't have a miracle pray for the family to have the strength to cope with what lays ahead.'
