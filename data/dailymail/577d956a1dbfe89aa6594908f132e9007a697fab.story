A screaming Ukranian man disrupted a Delta Air Lines flight and damaged the airplane by running up the aisle and attempting to open an emergency exit, according to the FBI.

Anatoliy N Baranovich was arrested on suspicion of interfering with the flight, from Boston to Salt Lake City, on Monday night.

He woke up during the plane's descent and started shouting in Russian, according to authorities.

Baranovich, who was carrying a Ukrainian passport and U.S. visa, said he thought the aircraft's wing was on fire and was trying to warn others, according to a complaint filed yesterday in U.S. District Court.

After the plane touched down, he got up from his seat and ran to the back of the aircraft, then tried to open the emergency exit door as a flight attendant ordered him to stop, it is claimed.

The door jammed and caused an emergency inflatable slide to malfunction, which caused 'extensive damage' to the plane's fuselage, the FBI said.

Several passengers tried to wrestle Baranovich to the ground while he attempted to open another emergency exit door.

One passenger forced him to the floor and held him until the plane taxied to a gate, where law enforcement and medical personnel had been called.

Baranovich told agents that he had been visiting family in Ukraine and was headed to Portland, Oregon, after a stop in Salt Lake City.

He said he had consumed alcohol while traveling but did not specify when or how much, according to the authorities.

Baranovich is scheduled to appear in court in Salt Lake City today.

Officials say they do not believe he posed a terrorist threat.
