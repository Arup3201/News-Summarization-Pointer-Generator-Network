View from the half-way line - check. Bag of sunflower seeds - check. Thunderstruck by AC/DC blasting in your ears - check. The costliest forward line in history - check... Welcome to the world of a Real Madrid season-ticket holder.

The European champions have just added James Rodriguez to their squad for a cool £60million. The crafty Colombian joins Gareth Bale (£86million), Cristiano Ronaldo (£80million), Karim Benzema (£28million) and Toni Kroos (£24million).

Real sell two types of season ticket. One for the club’s 19 league home games and one for all games including home Champions League and home Copa del Rey matches.

The price of the league ticket (Abono tradicional) range from £175 to £1450 and the all inclusive ‘Euroabono’ range from £254 to £1879.

You have to be a socio (member of the club) to buy a season ticket and that also costs money with an annual payment of around £120.

As there are far more socios than season tickets, waiting lists are long and many members pay their annual subscription to be a member but can do no more than try to buy tickets on a game-by-game basis from season ticket holders who can’t attend matches.

A Madrid fan buying the most expensive season ticket for £1879 + £120 membership pays out £1997 and if Madrid reach the semi-final stage of both the Champions League and the Copa del Rey he gets 29 games for his euros at £68 a match.

Talent: Karim Benzema is just one of the spectacular talents on show at the Bernabeu

The credit card style season ticket gets
 you into the ground with a swipe on the turnstile and once inside a 
hot-dog will cost you about £5 and the programme is free but don’t get 
too excited because it’s a flimsy pamphlet filled with ads interspersed 
with some big pictures of the players.

You’ll only get wet if you’re in the ‘cheap’ seats as most of the ground is covered and if you are close enough to the directors’ box you should just about feel the warmth coming from the overhead heaters. Oh and you get to watch about £240million worth of talent every week – although sometimes the competition can make it feel a little bit like watching Pee-wee Herman sparring with one of the Klitschko brothers.

There are no pies but if chewing on sunflower seeds is your thing then you are in luck. Be warned however that the seeds are still in their shells, so do as the locals do and open the shells with your teeth spitting out the outer casing before enjoying the seed itself… otherwise you’ll be chewing for a long time.

Apparently
 chewing on sunflower seeds helps you give up smoking, which is not easy
 to do at the Santiago Bernabeu because there is no ban inside the 
stadium, and if you are unlucky enough to be sat next to a smoker you’ll
 be smoking too.

You
 can buy drinks and take them to your seat in a plastic cup but the beer
 is alcohol free. Most supporters eat and drink outside the ground 
before the game which explains why the stadium is always empty until 
about 20 minutes before kick-off.

Supporters
 also fill the club shop before kick-off as there is no merchandising 
sold inside. Another advantage of arriving at your seat late is you miss
 out on AC/DC’s Thunderstruck being played at around 80 decibels on the 
club’s ‘Galatico’ sound-system.
