She became known to the world as the Angel of Mostar for her work in saving wounded children and their families in the besieged Bosnian city during the Balkans war.

And with the huge dangers she faced in the war-torn country, Sally Becker has spoken previously of the debt she owed to Major Bill Foxton - who, she says, helped to save her life after she was ambushed by a masked gunman in 1998.

But as well as owing her life to the highly-decorated officer, the 51-year-old has also revealed for the first time that Major Bill Foxton was the father of the unborn  daughter she was carrying at the time of the attack.

Sally, who rescued up to 250 children from Bosnia and Kosovo during the Nineties conflict, says that she has only now decided to reveal the truth following Major Foxton's death in 2009.

Tragically, the former army officer committed suicide after losing up to £1 million of his life savings in financier Bernard Madoff's £35billion fraud.

In an interview with The Sun, the Balkans hero said she had always hoped her daughter - named Billie, after her late father - would be reunited with him - a dream which she says broke her heart when she knew it could not come true.

Speaking about when she first told the former Army Officer that she was expecting his child, she said: 'I rang to tell Bill and his first words were, 'I would be honoured to father your child.'

'Then he dropped the bombshell that he was still married and he asked me to never reveal he was Billie's father.

'I have always respected that but when Bill died I realised I had no-one to protect any more.'

Sally, who now lives in Brighton, has previously said that she owed her life to Major Foxton, who headed up the European Commission monitoring mission in the Balkans war.

'I met Bill in 1998 during a mission to deliver aid to the refugees on the Kosovo-Albanian border,' she said.

'He was very charismatic and extremely knowledgeable, with a great sense of humour.

'When the nurses left, there was no one around to perform the minor surgical procedure necessary for my leg wound to heal. So Bill, who was trained in field medicine, took over.

'Five or six times a day, I gritted my teeth while he dug away at the wound. He patiently removed the blue cotton threads that were blasted through my leg on the point of the bullet. He also had to snip away dead tissue to avoid the gangrene.

'I have no doubt that without his help, I would have lost my leg.'

As well as making the startling revelations about the identity of her daughter's father, the former aid worker - who was tasked with being part of the team who carried the Olympic flag into the stadium at last weekend's London 2012 Opening Ceremony - spoke of her devastation upon hearing news of Major Foxton's death in her new book 'Sunflowers and Snipers'.

She wrote that it broke her heart that he had chosen to die alone.

In a previous interview, the Angel of Mostar has also spoken of the admiration for the man she now admits fathered her child.

She said: 'On his days off, Bill liked to go fishing. On one trip he saw a group of people in some distress. A small boy had been chasing after his dog when there was an explosion and the dog was killed.

'The child was now trapped in the minefield, afraid to move.

'Slowly, Bill crawled towards the child, using a knife to gently detect mines buried just beneath the surface. He managed to reach the boy and brought him safely back to his family.

'Bill hadn't mentioned it to anyone, but when the family entered the town talking about the heroic action of the man with red hair and a hook, he was soon tracked down and was later awarded a medal for his bravery.'

Major Foxton served in the French Foreign Legion before joining the British Army in 1969, serving with the Royal Green Jackets until 1975. He went on to serve with British officers in the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces.

He was awarded both the MBE and the OBE.

His last overseas trip saw him run humanitarian projects in Afghanistan before retiring last November.

Sally added: 'I hadn't seen Bill for several years but I knew he was in Afghanistan recently. So when I heard the tragic news, I immediately assumed he had been killed by a stray bullet or bomb.

'I was profoundly shocked to hear that he died alone on a park bench in Southampton.'
