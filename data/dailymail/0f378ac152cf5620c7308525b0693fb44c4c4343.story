Eva
 Peron's rise from aspiring actress to political supremo and Spiritual 
Leader of Argentina began in 1944 in Buenos Aires, where she met 
Colonel Juan Peron.

The couple were married in 1945 and one year later, Juan was elected President of Argentina.

In following years, Eva built up swathes of support and was touted as a potential vice-president, but she died of cancer aged just 33 in 1952.

He added that he expected many visitors to 'fly in especially for the sale'.
