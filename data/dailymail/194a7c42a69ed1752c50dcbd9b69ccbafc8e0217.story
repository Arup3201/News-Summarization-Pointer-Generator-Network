A baker who piled on the pounds after munching on her own delicious cakes has finally resisted temptation and lost almost 5st.

Rachel Gillion, 40, from Cannock, Staffordshire, tipped the scales at 14st 5lb, but despite being surrounded by cake mixture, sugar, and icing every day, has managed to lose almost 5st.

The cake baker, who makes handmade celebration and birthday cakes, joined Weight Watchers and now weighs in at a healthy 9st 8lb.

By her own admission, Rachel had a terrible diet before her weight loss, picking at her baking ingredients as well as indulging in junk food

It was only when a friend suggested joining Weight Watchers that Rachel began to change her diet, dropping from 14st 5lb (left) to a trim 9st 11lb (right)

Rachel said: 'I used to think nothing of eating the cakes.

'At my busiest I can make and decorate three to four cakes a week, so I was always surrounded by ingredients and unhealthy food.

'My favourite was carrot cake - I just couldn’t help but pick at them, I’ve got quite a sweet tooth.

'To be honest, I was just being greedy.

'On top of that, my diet was awful, I’d have at least one takeaway a week.'

But after a friend suggested joining Weight Watchers just 10 months ago, Rachel has gone on to lose almost five stone.

Rachel said: 'I was with my friend who’d just had a baby and she said that she was going to join Weight Watchers and did I want to go with her.

'I was absolutely dreading it.

'I thought you had to be really desperate to join Weight Watchers, but it was totally different to what I’d thought it was going to be.

Rachel now continues to bake cakes for her online business, Cake Craft by Rachel, but is no longer tempted by her sweet treats

'It was so easy and in the first week I lost five and half pounds.

'I was really focused, and didn’t pick at my cakes at all, when I saw that it was working I was determined to keep going.'

Rachel now continues to bake cakes for her online business, Cake Craft by Rachel, but is no longer tempted by her sweet treats.

Rachel said: 'I know it’s hard to believe but I don’t touch the cakes anymore.

'Before, I had such low self-esteem that I never went to any social events or went on nights out.

'I just did the school run and worked from home on the cakes.

'But now I’m so much more active and sociable - my life has changed.'

Rachel has battled with her weight for as long as she can remember.

She said: 'My weight has always been up and down.

'But everything went downhill after I had my third baby in 2010.

'I started to gain more weight and it was hard to keep in check - I have an underactive thyroid too so it was difficult.

'The underactive thyroid meant that I was gaining weight really easily, it was hard to deal with.

'I started to get very frustrated and I just ended up in a bit of a hole, I hated how big I was and I just used to hide away.

'I didn’t go anywhere, I’d made excuses so I didn’t have to go out.

'I was 5ft 2in and 14st 5lb - my self-esteem was at an all-time low.'

Rachel’s poor diet contributed to her weight gain.

She said: 'I would have a takeaway about once a week and my portions were way out of control.

'I would buy a big bag of sweets and just eat the whole bag.

'I could eat three or four bars of chocolate in an evening.”

But thanks to the suggestion from her friend, Rachel began to lose weight and hasn’t looked back since.

Rachel said: 'I never thought Weight Watchers would work for me, so I was supposed when I lost so much in the first week.

'Before I knew where I was the weight was just coming off - I can’t sing their praises enough.

'I reached my goal weight last week and I’m thrilled - I haven’t been this weight since I was 19.

'My family, and my husband have been supportive throughout, and I can already feel the health benefits.

'I’m even thinking about becoming a Weight Watchers leader - my own leader, Ange Smith, was incredible.

'I just wish I’d done this years ago.'
