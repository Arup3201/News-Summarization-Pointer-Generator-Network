Author Zadie Smith said it was 'absurd' to suggest motherhood is a threat to creativity

It was once claimed that a pram in the hall is the enemy of good art.

But Zadie Smith has launched an impassioned defence of writers with children – pointing out that Charles Dickens had ten.

The White Teeth author, who has juggled her career with raising two children, entered an online debate over the late writer Cyril Connolly, who declared: ‘There is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall.’

Miss Smith, 37, replied: ‘I have two children. Dickens had ten.’

Referring also to Tolstoy, who had fourteen children, she asked: ‘Did anyone worry that those men were becoming too father-ish to be writer-esque? The idea that motherhood is inherently somehow a threat to creativity is just absurd.’

Miss Smith, a Cambridge graduate, has two young children with her husband, poet Nick Laird. She urged the Government to help working mothers by addressing the high cost of childcare.

‘What IS a threat to all women’s freedoms is the issue of time, which is the same problem whether you are a writer, factory worker or nurse,’ she said. ‘We need decent public day-care services, partners who do their share, affordable childcare and a supportive community of friends and family.’

She added that having children had helped her creatively. ‘Two kids entertaining each other in one room gives their mother in another room a surprising amount of free time she would not have otherwise,’ she said.

Defiant: Miss Smith argued the Government should do more to try and help working mothers with the high cost of childcare

Her intervention came after US author Lauren Sandler suggested that female authors should limit themselves to one child.

Sandler, who is promoting her book on the subject, cited Susan Sontag and Joan Didion as her examples of successful writers who stuck to having one child.

But it wasn’t long before other women writers took up arms, including Pulitzer Prize-winning Jane Smiley.

Smiley wrote: ‘I have three children of my own and two stepchildren.

‘The key is not having one child, it is living in a place where there is excellent daycare and a social world that allows fathers to have the time and the motivation to fully share in raising kids.’

Adding her own comments, Miss Smith went on to name Marilynne Robinson and Toni Morrison as writers who have visited the labour ward more than once.

Smith won the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2006 and her novel White Teeth was included in Time magazine’s TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005 list.

In April, she was selected as one of Britain’s best young novelists by Granta, the literary magazine.
