David Cameron once spoke out against the dangers of using Twitter - declaring 'too many twits might make a tw**'.

But it seems Members of Parliament have ignored the Prime Minister's advice - with soaring numbers signing up to the popular website according to a new study. 

Over the past 12 months MPs wasted almost 60 hours a week sending messages on Twitter, it has been revealed.

There are more Tory MPs than any other party using Twitter - but also the highest proportion who have not yet signed up. Overall,  71 per cent of MPs are now on Twitter

The number of MPs using Twitter soared following the 2011 decision to allow smart phones and iPads to be used in the chamber to send messages.

Over the past 12 months MPs sent a total of 718,431 Tweets – which works out at more than 1,500 messages for each of the 461 MPs on Twitter.

In total, MPs spent a combined total of over 115 days - or more than 2,774 hours – sending messages to their followers between July 29 last year and July 28 last month.

The extent of Parliament’s addiction to Twitter is detailed in a study compiled by the political lobbying firm Westminster Public Affairs.

Overall, 71 per cent of MPs are now on Twitter – an increase since January 2010 of 350 MPs using Twitter. There are also 118 peers - 15 per cent of the House of Lords - who use the site.

Out of the main three political parties, 82 per cent of Lib Dems are on Twitter – 46 MPs - 75 per cent of Labour MPs - 193 – and 67 per cent of Tories, or some 203 MPs.

Olly Kendall, the managing director of Westminster Public Affairs, said: ‘MPs are sending tweets in a far greater volume than ever before. In 2011 we calculated that MPs spend a total of 1,000 hours on Twitter. That number has significantly increased.

‘The relaxation of the Commons Twitter ban, overturned at the start of 2011, which until then outlawed Tweeting in the Chamber has certainly helped to increase the volume of tweets sent.’

In 2011 11 MPs signed an amendment which would have effectively banned the use of Twitter and other micro-blogging in the Commons

The ammedment would have limited MPs to only 'receive and send urgent messages' while in the Commons, but was defeated by 206 to 63.

Until 2011 there had been an informal arrangement allowing MPs to use handheld devices such as BlackBerrys, iPhones and iPads but not laptops in the Commons so they can keep up with their day-to-day business.

But amid a surge in popularity among MPs for using Twitter, a Commons committee attempted to update the rules.

Labour MP Luciana Berger said moves to limit the use of mobile phones so only 'urgent messages' could be exchanged - effectively banning the use of Twitter - were 'anti-democratic, regressive and bemusing to the public'.

She added: 'It's a very useful way to connect with communities we were elected to serve. We are all adults and we are all mindful of how we are viewed in the eyes of the public and the importance of being respectful to each other.'

She was supported by Tory Clare Perry, who said tweeting helped MPs to 'stay informed, in touch and accountable to their constituents'. Any ban would be 'an inexplicable step back in time'.

But Roger Gale said the use of Twitter would mean MPs could be prompted to ask certain questions.

He said MPs were already reading 'vast tracts' of briefs prepared by lobbyists, while 'genuine debate'' had often been stifled by MPs turning to speeches prepared for them by other people.

 Mr Gale continued: 'If we are now to suggest that Members are going to be allowed to Twitter and receive comment in the course of these debates then it is absolutely inevitable that you will have people sitting in the public gallery sending messages saying 'ask him this, tell her that, read this'. That is not what this place is about.' 

His Conservative colleague James Gray, who signed the amendment, said one ''very senior'' MP told him the Commons should observe the same rules as the opera and ban mobile devices completely.

He warned the Procedure Committee's report would mean ''we end up with a room full of MPs staring at devices - as I can see three or four doing as I look round the chamber at the moment''.

Mr Gray added: 'I think it brings the whole nature of debate in this place into some disrepute. I would like to see the standard of debate here maintained. We are the Mother of Parliaments, let us engage in detailed and logical debate and let us not spend an excessive amount of time on our electronic devices.'
