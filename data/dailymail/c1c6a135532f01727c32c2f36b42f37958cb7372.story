Modern celebrities are all  too ready to show as much flesh as possible – but the relatively demure Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe has topped a poll for the best celebrity curves of all time. 

She beat British model Kelly Brook, Christina Hendricks of TV hit Mad Men and US reality star Kim Kardashian, with four out of ten people voting Monroe’s body as the best.

Brook came second, but old-school glamour rules as Monroe, who died more than 50 years ago, came out on top.

She was joined in the top five by Raquel Welch, now 72, in third place, Sophia Loren, 78, fourth, and  Jayne Mansfield, who died  in 1967, fifth.

The poll of more than 2,000 men and women across the UK found that curves are favoured by six out of ten people.

Men find women’s bottoms the most attractive, followed by their busts and waist. Women considered waists to be the most appealing.

The study was commissioned to mark the launch of the new Peugeot RCZ Sports Coupe.

The car’s designer, Boris Reinmoller, said: ‘The study shows the continued appeal of the curve.

'There is no one to match the curvaceous wonder of Marilyn Monroe.

‘She had it all: style,  class and enough edge  to thrill men and women  for generations – the perfect combination.’
