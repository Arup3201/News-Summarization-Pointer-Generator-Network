Soviets may have spent up to $1billion on unconventional psychology research from as early as 1917, it has emerged.

A new report uncovering previously classified information has revealed how the USSR worked tirelessly to come up with a mind control programme that would rival that of the U.S.

The paper by Serge Kernbach confirms for the first time that Soviets used methods to manipulate test subjects' brains.

The work titled 'Unconventional research in USSR and Russia: short overview' details the experiments researchers called 'psychotronics'.

Kernbach, of the Research Centre of Advanced Robotics and Environmental Science in Stuttgart, Germany, based the work on Russian technical journals.

He reveals how Soviets developed a device to generate and store high-frequency electromagnetic radiation called 'cerpan'.

'If the generator is designed properly, it is able to accumulate bioenergy from all living things - animals, plants, humans - and then release it outside,' writes Kernbach.

The pyschotronics program or 'parapsychology' as it was called in the U.S. involves unconventional research into mind and control and remote influence, reports news.com.

While the two countries worked on their relative projects in secrecy, the report reveals much of what they were investigating was the same.

Indeed the psychotronics program draws similarities to America's MKUltra - a human research operation experimenting in the behavioral control of humans through the CIA's Scientific Intelligence Division.

The program was introduced in 1950 - some 30 years after the Soviets' efforts in parapsychology research.

Though paper reveals the USSR's early research into the subject, it does not disclose the results of such experiments or whether or not similar work is ongoing in Russia today.

Unlike the Soviets' research, Project MKUltra has been well documented since being shut down in 1973.

The program was officially sanctioned in 1953, and carried out much of its research illegally by enlisting unwitting subjects who were, on occasion, subjected to taking drugs without their knowledge.

Researchers used various methodologies to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as various forms of torture.

As many as 80 institutions carried out the research including universities, hospitals and colleges.

It was first brought to the attention of the public in 1975 by the U.S. Congress, but all files relating to the research had been destroyed under the instruction of former CIA director Richard Helms in 1973.
