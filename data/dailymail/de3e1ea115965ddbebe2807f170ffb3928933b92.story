Angkor in Cambodia is one of the most significant archaeological sites in southeast Asia and home to the magnificent remains of the Angkor Wat and Bayon temples, as well as their elaborate bas-reliefs.

Armchair tourists can now explore these 
remains using more than 90,000 panoramic images captured as part of Google's latest Cultural Institute project.

Google said the images 'let people experience the scale and beauty of Angkor wherever they are', but also demonstrate how technology can change the way cultural treasures are preserved for future generations.

'The temples at Angkor each have a unique story - whether it’s the way they were built, the ancient Khmer cities they sit on, or the artwork they contain,’ explained Manik Gupta, group product manager at Google Maps.

'To give you the most complete picture, our team used all the tools available to us: Street View cars, Trekkers and tripods to carefully photograph the exteriors and interiors of Angkor’s temples as they stand today.

Angkor Wat lies 3.4 miles (5.5km) north of the town of Siem Reap in Cambodia. The region contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries.

At the beginning of the 9th century the two states that covered the territory of modern Cambodia were united by Jayavarman II.

The Angkor Wat temple was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century. Although Angkor Wat appears, at first glance, to be a mass of stone with a central causeway it actually consists of a series of elevated towers, covered galleries, chambers, porches and courtyards on different levels connected by stairs. The galleries and its columns set the boundaries for the first and second levels, while the third level supports five towers  - one in each corner, pictured, and one in the centre

The guardian monkey statues, pictured, sit at the Banteay Srei temple in Angkor and the whole temple is in the process of being restored. Anastylosis restoration, which involves reassembling structures based on their original materials and positions, was first used at Banteay Srei in the 1930s. The work continues today through a joint venture between the Swiss and Cambodian governments. Though vandalism and pilfering have taken their toll, the temple is one of the best preserved sites in Angkor

Carvings at Angkor Wat's central sanctuary's west entrance, pictured, depict a duel between monkey brothers Valin and Sugriva from the Hindu tale Ramayana. Wat is the Khmer name for temple. It was built as a Hindu place of worship but in 1432 the capital moved to Phnom Penh and Angkor Wat was maintained by Buddhist monks

He laid the foundations of what became the Khmer Empire, which was a major power in southeast Asia for five centuries, and established two cities. 

The first was built with temples in its centre at Roluos, alongside the Bakong and Preah Ko temples - all constructed around 880AD. The second capital at Yasodharapura, modern-day Angkor, was built in the 960s, with the state temple of Pre Rup.

The Angkor Wat temple was built by the Khmer King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century.

Wat is the Khmer word for temple. It was built as a Hindu place of worship but in 1432, when the capital moved to Phnom Penh, Angkor Wat was maintained by Buddhist monks.

The outer gallery of the temple contains bas-reliefs that stretch for almost 1,960ft (600m), inlcluding the Ramayana gallery in the western section of the temple and this gallery in the east. The Churning of the Ocean of Milk, pictured, is the most famous of Angkor Wat's bas reliefs. In it, gods and demons stir up the Ocean of Milk to retrieve the treasures within, including the elixir of immortality

The Terrace of the Elephants, pictured, was constructed for King Jayavarman VII as a viewing platform for public ceremonies and military processions. Its walls are sculpted with parading elephants and huge mythical birds and lions

Although Angkor Wat appears, at first glance, to be a mass of stone with a central causeway, it actually consists of a series of elevated towers and covered galleries on different levels connected by stairs.

The galleries and its columns set the boundaries for the first and second levels, while the third level supports five towers - one in each corner, and one in the centre. 

Each tower features graduated tiers that create a cone shape, and the highest tower within the temple complex is 699ft (213m).

The outer gallery of the temple contains bas-reliefs that stretch for almost 1,960ft (600m), including the Ramayana gallery in the western section.

It is thought Angkor Wat was built as funerary temple for King Suryavarman II facing the west towards the setting sun – a symbol for death.

The bas-reliefs were designed to be viewed from left to right in the order of a Hindu funeral ritual, and this supports the funerary claims.

Angkor Wat is said to be a ‘miniature replica of the universe in stone’ and represents an earthly model of the cosmic world.

The central tower was built to symbolise the mythical mountain of Meru, for example, at the centre of the universe, while the five towers correspond to the peaks of Meru.

The outer wall is said to correspond to the mountains at the edge of the world, and the moat is symbolic of the oceans. 

Meanwhile, the Bayon is a Khmer temple built in the late 12th century as the official state temple of the Mahayana Buddhist King Jayavarman VII. 

The temple stands at the centre of Jayavarman's capital, Angkor Thom. 

It consists of stone faces and towers built from upper terraces. These towers are built surrounding its centre and have two bas-reliefs that feature a mix of mythological, historical, and everyday scenes.

Other images within Google's latest collection include monkey statues that sit in Banteay Srei - a 10th century Cambodian temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.

Different guardian figures, usually of a human body with an animal head, protect the six stairways leading up to the sanctuaries.

The monkey-headed statues are replicas and were created when the originals were moved to the National Museum in Phnom Penh.
