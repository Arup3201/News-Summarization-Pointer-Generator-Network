It is the type of vegetable a person eats, not gorging on large quantities that helps beat obesity, a new study has found.

Eating as little as one or two fist-sized portions of leafy green and orange vegetables has been found to 'significantly' reduce an overweight child's risk of suffering obesity-related diseases including type 2 diabetes, liver and heart disease. 

Regardless of whether the youngsters taking part in the study lost weight, selecting the right vegetables to eat is a critical part of the puzzle, scientists discovered.

The team of researchers at the universities of Texas and Southern California found that boosting levels of spinach and broccoli, as well as carrots, in a child's diet reduced the level of 'bad fats' in the body.

A new study has found that eating one or two fist-sized portions of carrots or leafy green vegetables a day can reduce the chance of overweight and obese children suffering type 2 diabetes,  liver disease and other obesity-related diseases

And the findings revealed the insulin levels of the overweight Latino children taking part also improved.

Children who regularly ate one or two fist-size portions of the non-starchy vegetables reduced their risk of liver problems, type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related illnesses.

While the children, who ranged in age from eight to 18, still failed to eat the recommended daily allowance of nutritious vegetables, as stipulated by the US Department of Agriculture, the scientists noted the improvements to their health were significant. 

Jaimie Davis, assistant professor at the University of Texas, said: 'For a lot of at-risk children, intake of vegetables is really low.

'We found, though, even eating less than a full serving of these vegetables can really have a pronounced effect on children's health.

'One large leafy green salad as a regular part of lunch is enough to make a difference.' 

The study noted fewer than six per cent of children in the US eat the USDA-recommended multiple servings of nutrient-rich vegetables most days.

Researchers examined the effects of nutrient-rich vegetables in the diets of 175 overweight or obese children in Los Angeles. 

The research, by a team at the universities of Texas and Southern California, found children who ate carrots, broccoli and spinach were at a reduced risk of suffering a raft of health problems linked to their weight

The study found the leafy green and orange, non-starchy vegetables lowered levels of bad fat in the body and helped regulate insulin levels 

They found very small differences - equating to a quarter of a cup or around 30g per day, could be linked to improvements insulin levels and a reduction in bad fats in the body.

Visceral fat is deemed 'bad fat' because it lingers around internal organs and masses in the liver.

Some types of body fats are more dangerous because they can cause serious health complications, sending the wrong signals to the brain about when and how much to eat. 

The scientists emphasised it is the type of vegetable that matters, adding that starchier vegetables such as corn and potatoes did not reap the same positive effects of leafy greens and orange-coloured options.  

The study was published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reports.
