Google wants your permission to use your name, photo and product reviews in ads that it sells to businesses.

The internet search giant is changing its terms of service starting Nov. 11, but it will only affect users with Google+.

Your reviews of restaurants, shops and products, as well as songs and other content bought on the Google Play store could show up in ads that are displayed to your friends and connections when they search on Google.

However, you can opt out of sharing.

Google's move follows a similar proposal by Facebook. The social network in August said it would show users' faces and names in ads about products they clicked to 'like'.

That proposal was criticized by privacy groups. They asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into the matter.

Google outlined the new changes on its website: 'Your Profile name and photo might appear in Google products (including reviews, advertising and other commercial contexts).

'You can control whether you image and name appear in ads via the Shared Endorsements setting'

Google went on to explain why they're making the changes, writing: 'We want to give you and your friends and connections the most useful information.

'Recommendations from people you know can really help. So your friends, family and others may see your Profile name and photo and content like the reviews you share or the ads you +1'd.'

More information about the changes can be found on Google's policies and principles page.
