An Australian photographer has sold one of his images for a record-breaking $US6.5 million ($A7.87 million).

Award-winning Peter Lik, 55, who was born in Melbourne, sold the world's most expensive photograph to an unnamed buyer this earlier week.

The black and white photo 'Phantom', which shows a ghostlike shape in a light beam within Arizona's Antelope Canyon, was sold along with two other images for a total of $US10 million ($A12.1 million).

A private buyer and long-time collector of Lik's works also purchased 'Eternal Moods' for $US1.1 million

A private buyer and long-time collector of Lik's works also purchased his images 'Illusion' for $US2.4 million and 'Eternal Moods' for $US1.1 million.

Including a previous $US1 million sale of his picture 'One' in 2012, Lik's works make up four of the top 20 most expensive photographs ever sold.

Some commentators have raised questions over the validity of the price tag because it has not been independently verified.

But lawyers acting on behalf of Lik and the buyer say the figure is correct.

The buyer's lawyer Joshua Roth, from Glaser Weil, said he was unable to provide documentation because the terms of the contracts were 'strictly confidential'.

'I can assure you that the sale was made but unfortunately that's the best I can do,' Mr Roth told Daily Mail Australia.

'It may seem like an unbelievable number but it's a unique picture by the artist and Mr. Lik normally makes only editioned artworks. 

Lik, 55, was born and grew up in Melbourne in Australia but moved to the U.S. in 1984

An unnamed collector, who has a number of Lik's works, also bought 'Illusion' for $US2.4 million

'This was, in the opinion of the artist and our client, the most important photo Mr. Lik ever shot.' 

Lik said certain textures and contours found in nature lended themselves beautifully to black and white photography.

'The purpose of all my photos is to capture the power of nature and convey it in a way that inspires someone to feel passionate and connected to the image,' he said.

'The intensity of contrasting light and dark spaces was surprising, but made for some of the most powerful images I've ever created.'

Lik's passion for photography began during his childhood in Australia, where he grew up the son of Czech immigrants.

He took his first photo at eight years old after his parents gave him a Brownie Kodak camera and he snapped a picture of a spider web in his backyard.

In 1984, the then-25-year-old moved to the U.S., where he developed a passion for landscape photography and the panoramic camera.
