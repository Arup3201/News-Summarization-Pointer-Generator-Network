A would-be terrorist has been found guilty of trying to blow up a crowded Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in Oregon.

Somali-born Mohamed Osman Mohamud was convicted of trying to use a weapon of mass destruction following his attempt to detonate a bomb at the festive event in Portland in November 2010.

Former Oregon State University student Mohamud, 21, is facing a potential life sentence after a jury returned a guilty verdict following less than seven hours of deliberations.

Mohamud, who was 19 at the time of the incident, was arrested after he tried to use a cell phone to trigger what he believed was a car bomb, but was actually a harmless device supplied by FBI agents posing as operatives for Islamist extremists.

The fake bomb was planted in a van near a downtown square crowded with thousands of people gathered for the seasonal festivities.

Mohamud's defence lawyer, who had 
argued that his client was a victim of government entrapment and would 
never have tried to carry out the bombing on his own, has said he will 
appeal and seek a 'substantially reduced' sentence for the 21-year-old, 
according to a report in The Oregonian.Â 

'We're disappointed with the verdict... we obviously thought he was entrapped,' said Stephen Sady.

U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall said: 'This trial provided a rare glimpse into the techniques al-Qaeda employs to radicalize home-grown extremists.'

The FBI had been keeping tabs on Mohamud for almost a year when agents were given the go ahead to 
investigate the naturalised U.S. citizen, following which two undercover
agents were tasked with posing as Al Qaeda operatives and befriending 
Mohamud.

A series of meetings followed during 
the period from July 30 2010 to November 26 2010, when agents presented 
Mohamud with a fake bomb for him to 'detonate' by pressing the keypad of
a cell phone at that night's event at Pioneer Courthouse Square.

When Mohamud twice pressed the button
to detonate the device from his position in the passenger seat of an 
SUV parked about 1,000 yards from the square, he was arrested by a team 
of FBI agents.

Mohamud's lawyers said in court documents that while Mohamud had pushed the button, he realises what he did was wrong.

'He deeply regrets his actions, and is humiliated and ashamed for what he said and did,' the documents said.

Mohamud is due to be sentenced on May 14.
