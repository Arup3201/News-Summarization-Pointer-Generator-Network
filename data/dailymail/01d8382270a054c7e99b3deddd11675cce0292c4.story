Attack: CCTV footage from the armed robbery in Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, on Monday morning, shows the two men entering the local post office dressed in long-haired wigs and dresses

Bad disguise: The armed robbers were able to get their hands on an unknown amount of cash, however, passers-by stepped in as they fled and the robbers dropped their haul in the struggle

The pair were able to get their hands on an unknown amount of cash before they fired two 'warning' shots and left the post office.

However, the robbers' plan was foiled by brave passers by, who tackled them as they left the post office, causing them to drop their haul in the street. 

A  member of staff was injured trying to stop them from leaving the premises on the village's high street.

'The images clearly show how noticeable this pair would have been to anyone who saw them in the moments leading up to the robbery and as they fled from the scene,'Detective Inspector Phil Jackson, of Leeds District CID, said.

 'It was initially reported that two female suspects entered the post office but it has now been established that the suspects were dressed as women and wearing wigs.

A post office worker was injured as he tried to stop the men, who fired two shots during the morning robbery 

'A firearm has been discharged twice, once inside the premises and once outside. No-one was injured as a result of these discharges. 

'The offenders left the scene in a white Nissan Juke which was found on fire nearby in Beeches End a short time later.

Det Insp Jackson added: 'A large amount of cash was recovered from outside the post office and we believe the offenders probably left empty handed. 

'This was mainly due to a number of members of the public who intervened and tried to tackle them.'

Detectives investigating the raid at 9.30am on Monday today arrested a 32-year-old woman on suspicion of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and also raided a home in the nearby village of Clifford.
