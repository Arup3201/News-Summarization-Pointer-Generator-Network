Manchester United will NOT pursue interest in Arturo Vidal.

Juventus are ready to sell the Chile midfielder and had hoped to agree a deal worth Â£32million with the Old Trafford club.

The 27-year-old is well regarded and came back from injury to impress in the World Cup, however, United have decided he is not for them.

Vidal's
 agent Fernando Felicevich was in London concluding business with 
Arsenal for his other client Alexis Sanchez and was understood to be due
 to hold talks with United over a proposed transfer.

Vidal
 is currently on holiday after competing at the World Cup in Brazil for 
his country, and when quizzed by Chilean newspaper La Tercera over 
whether he would be joining United, he said: 'I've heard about the 
rumours, but I haven't spoken more about this subject.

'I'm
 enjoying my holidays, and when I return to Italy I'll see what happens.
 Anyone would like to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world.'

Italian
 newspaper reports on Monday even claimed a deal had been agreed between
 the two clubs but that will not be the case as United consider other 
options.

United's valuation of the player is understood to be several million less than that of the Italian side and the Old Trafford club will not pay over the odds, despite new manager Van Gaal identifying Vidal as one of his leading targets to strengthen his midfield.
