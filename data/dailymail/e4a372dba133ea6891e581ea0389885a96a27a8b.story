A jilted boyfriend who murdered his long-term partner by slitting her throat after she dumped him has been jailed for life.

Clarke Dean, 47, stabbed Michelle Giles, 43, to death at their flat in Solihull, West Midlands, while their 16-year-old daughter was away on a camping trip.

Just weeks before her murder, Ms Giles had told Dean - who drank up to 25 cans of lager a day – that she wanted to end their relationship of over 20 years because of his alcoholism.

However, Warwickshire Justice Centre heard how unemployed Dean refused to accept the relationship had ended and started to loiter at the Starbucks in Solihull town centre where she worked.

Then, on August 8 last year, paramedics were called to reports of a stabbing at their home shortly after 2am.

Neighbours described hearing 'spine chilling' screams from a woman which caused them to 'wake in terror'.

When they went into the hallway they found Dean pleading for help telling them he'd 'stabbed her'.

Despite the efforts of ambulance staff, nothing could be done to save Ms Giles and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

The large blood stained knife which was used to kill her was found in the kitchen sink.

A post mortem examination found that she died from multiple stab wounds and a cut throat.

When interviewed, Dean refused to answer police questions but denied killing his partner when he was charged with her murder.

During his trial, the court heard how he said he could not remember killing Ms Giles, and admitted to regularly drinking more than 25 cans of lager a day.

He was found guilty of her murder yesterday and jailed for life, meaning he will serve a minimum of 15 years before being eligible for parole.

Detective Sergeant Michael Griffiths, of West Midlands Police, said: 'During the trial Dean accepted that he had killed Michelle, but could not recall doing it.

'He claimed that his judgement was impaired as he suffered from Alcohol Dependency Syndrome and asked the jury to accept a defence of diminished responsibility.

'However they rejected these claims and found him guilty of murder.

Dean was jailed for life at Warwickshire Justice Centre (pictured) and will serve a minimum of 15 years 

'This tragic crime has robbed a woman of her life, a child of her mother and parents of a loving daughter.

'Dean claimed to love Michelle but had he truly felt for her he would not and could not have harmed her let alone kill her.'

In a statement read to the court, Ms Giles' teenage daughter told of her loss and said: 'My wonderful mother was caring and loving, young and bubbly only to have her life cut short.

'For the rest of my life I am going to have to live in a world without my mum.'
