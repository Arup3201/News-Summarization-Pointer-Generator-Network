A 3-year-old girl has died in Maryland after she was stabbed and shot by her father, who was then killed in a gun battle with police while fleeing the scene of another crime and leading cops in a high-speed chase.

Prince George's County police were called to a home in Camp Spring about 1 pm on Saturday. There they found a man had shot two people, believed to be the girl's maternal grandfather and great-grandmother.

The suspect —  Frederick Roy Miller, 38, of Landover — grabbed 3-year-old Laila Miller, jumped into his Nissan Altima and sped away, the Washington Post reported.

Miller, a disabled Marine veteran, stopped twice to shoot at officers as he zoomed through nearby Temple Hills. Six cops returned fire at him.

The second time police shot back, the suspect was struck and killed.

When police got to Miller's car, they made a heartbreaking discovery.

'There’s a small child in the vehicle we believe to be his biological daughter of the suspect, but we’re still trying to confirm,' Lt. Bill Alexander, of the Prince George’s County Police, told WJZ.

'That young child was also struck some time during the encounter,' he added. We don’t know when, we don’t know by who.'

Police on Sunday said that Miller had stabbed and shot 3-year-old Laila, the Washington Post reported.

The toddler was taken to the hospital but died later of her injuries.

The grandparents were shot near this garage door, right before Miller sped away with 3-year-old Laila

The other two victims were hospitalized, where they remain in critical condition, according to NBC Washington.

The shooting could be related to an ongoing custody fight between Miller and the girl's mother, who was not present during the incident, according to the Washington Post.

The parents have been fighting in the court system since after the girl was born in 2011.

Miller at first had weekend visitation rights, but was eventually restricted to supervised visits, the paper reported.

'He contacted anybody and everybody to ask for help,' one woman who knows the family told the post. 'All he wanted was to see his daughter.'
