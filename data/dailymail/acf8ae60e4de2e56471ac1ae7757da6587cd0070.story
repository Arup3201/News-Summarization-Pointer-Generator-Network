With their killer abdominal muscles, endless legs and curves in all the right places, the Victoria's Secret Angels have figures that make them the envy of many women.

And now, some of the lingerie giant's most famous faces have joined forces to showcase their enviable bodies whilst modelling a new swimwear line for the brand.

Although the official campaign shots are yet to be unveiled, these exclusive behind-the-scenes images give a taste of what's to come.

Shot on location on a sun-drenched St. 
Bart's beach, the likes of Alessandra Ambrosio, Erin Heatherton, 
Magdalena Frackowiak and Candice Swanepoel can be seen splashing around 
in the label's latest swimwear collection.

The swimming costumes, which are displayed to 
perfection on the Victoria's Secret beauty's perfect figures, are available 
in a variety of styles.

From vibrant blue one-pieces to fluorescent bikinis, the new range will seemingly suit all ages.
