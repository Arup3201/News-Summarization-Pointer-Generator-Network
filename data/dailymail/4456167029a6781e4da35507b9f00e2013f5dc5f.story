A drunken investment broker told his estranged wife 'I'll f***ing gas you. I'm Adolf' during a three-day Christmas harassment campaign.

Mark Symington launched a bigoted tirade at his wife Sarah on Christmas Eve.

She was wrapping Christmas presents when a torrent of  foul-mouthed phone calls started.

Mark Symington launched a bigoted tirade at his wife Sarah over Christmas last year

Symington, from Ross-shire, continued to call for three days.

The
49-year-old made more than 20 drunken calls during the early hours of 
Christmas Day itself. At one point, he told her: 'I’ll f***ing gas you. 
I’m Adolf.'

He later 
claimed he made the drunken calls out of frustration after being 
prevented from  seeing his children for more than three years since the 
end of the marriage.

Symington, who has since been involved in an acrimonious divorce after splitting up in 2008, said: 'You think you’re clever.

'You’re
just a greedy little  Jewish princess. You’re just a silly little 
gold-digger. You’ve got a few fur coats, you’ve also got my kilt and 
waistcoat, which I’d rather like, and my antiques, which I’d rather 
like.'

At Perth Sheriff
Court on Wednesday, Symington admitted making offensive calls, 
aggravated by religious prejudice, to Mrs Symington at her home in 
Crieff, Perthshire, between December 24 and 27 last year.

Sheriff
Lindsay Foulis said: 'It defeats me that someone of 49,  who appears to
have some sort of insight and ability, engages in three nights of what 
can only be described as an unpleasant tirade against an estranged 
spouse.

'This course of conduct was unpleasant in the extreme. He has had a background in investment and is not an immature teenager.'

Fiscal
depute Carol Whyte said: 'The accused and the complainer were married 
but have been separated since 2008. Since an acrimonious separation, the
accused has not seen his children, although he still provides financial
support for them and Mrs Symington.'

Perth Sheriff Court heard that 49 year old Symington made more than 20 drunken phone calls during the early hours of Christmas Day

Mrs Whyte said the victim started receiving messages shortly before 9pm on Christmas Eve, with more than 20 during an hour-long period from 2.05am on Christmas Day.

During these, Symington  said: 'It would be very nice to actually have something. I would like to have some contact with two little people I love.

'Happy f***ing Christmas. I don’t know what you feel you have achieved. You can give this to your scumbag lawyer, because I am taking it all the way.

'I am going to leave messages till you ring back. You think you are clever. Stupid little inter-national housewife.'

Mrs Whyte told the court Mrs Symington was still up wrapping presents as the stream of messages continued.

Solicitor John McLaughlin, defending, said Symington was £20,000 in debt and obtained his main source of income from the B&B business he operates.

Two years ago, Symington – who suffered financial losses on the stock market – walked into a pub after wrecking his £70,000 Maserati at the harbour at Shieldaig.

Witnesses saw the sports car swerve off the road and hit rocks supporting the sea wall, before Symington – who had his dog with him – got out and went into the pub.

At Dingwall Sheriff Court, he admitted drink-driving and was banned from the road for 18 months and fined £500 on April 1, 2010.
