This summer's Commonwealth Games saw a number of rising young stars step up to the plate to achieve success in front of a British crowd.

One of them was sprinter Jodie Williams, 20, who a won silver medal in the 200m and a bronze in the 4 x 100m relay.

As a former World Junior champion, Welwyn Garden City born Jodie has been well-known in athletic circles for years. But it's her performance in Glasgow that has put her on the map.

Toned: Jodie said anyone can get super abs like hers with the right diet and exercise

Now she's in demand with the media and, making time for the MailOnline, she said it's her abs as well as her medals that have been gathering attention.

She welcomes the interest as she thinks it's great more people are aspiring to be fit rather than thin.

She said: 'People are now always asking me about my 
figure and how I get my abs which shows people are striving for a healthy look rather than 
just trying to be skinny.'

When it comes to those amazing abs, she said it's not just about exercise but eating well by following a healthy, protein-rich diet.

Role model: Jodie said she has often felt self-conscious about having a muscular physique but wants to show other girls it's better to be fit than thin

Breakfast: Porridge with a protein
 shake in it and added berries.

Mid morning: An amino acid 
shake

Lunch: Prawn stirfry

Dinner: Steak with potatoes and vegetables

She said: 'A lot of people think you can get abs 
just through sit ups but it's more about diet.

'Everyone has abs so once you get down to a lower level of body fat they 
will start to show. To make them look better you can then do sit ups.'

Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill admitted she used to suffer from some name calling over her athletic build when she was growing up.

Jodie said she has been lucky to have never experienced any similar bullying. But even though her Hertfordshire school and local running club, Herts Phoenix, were fully supportive of her athletic talent -  she admits it can be difficult growing as a sporty girl.

She explains: 'It's hard doing sport from the age of 12 
upwards if all your friends have stopped doing it. I was determined so I
 managed to keep it going but a lot of my friends stopped doing sport. 
It's hard when you are doing something on your own.'

She added that she often felt self-conscious about having a muscular physique - but took inspiration from role models in athletics like U.S. sprinter Allyson Felix.

Inspiration: Jodie, celebrating her success in Glasgow, right, says she's always looked up to Allyson Felix of USA, left, as she's proved women can be feminine and elegant as well as strong and athletic

Young talent: Jodie has been running since childhood as a member of Herts Phoenix Athletic Club

'Often young girls don't want to get into sport so I think it's important they have strong role models to inspire them. I've 
always looked up to Allyson Felix,' she said. 'She always looks so graceful on the 
track, she has a really elegant running style. She also looks so 
feminine. I think that was something I was conscious of growing up in 
sport - you don't want to look too manly.'

Now in turn, she hopes she can inspire other young girls by showing them that a fit physique is much better than a skinny one and that you can be feminine as well as strong.  

She added that it helps that the 'sporty look' has become for fashionable since London 2012. Not just with people trying to tone up but with sports brands developing more stylish kit.

'I wear Adidas Boost trainers casually 
as well as when training because they're in bright, trendy colours,' she said. 'Sports clothing 
has also become more fashionable with bright, patterned designs. It helps because it makes you want to put on the kit and work out.'

When she's not in her sports gear doing running sessions and weight training, Jodie describes her style as 'edgy' and she's mostly likely to be found browsing the rails of Urban Outfitters.

Jodie joined her local running club at a young age and she hopes the Commonwealth Games, and forthcoming European Champs, will encourage others - both young and old - to do the same.

Aside from joining a local club or gym to keep fit, she recommends finding 'community walking or cycling routes in your area'.

She added: 'Even if you don't want to go the gym, 
there are workouts you can do at home without any equipment like squats 
and lunges. Instead of buying weights you can just use a bag of sugar.'
