Students from Glenmore Park High School, in Penrith, NSW, became involved in a vicious fight erupting during the school day in which students were pushed to the ground and physically assaulted.

'[They were] punching her in the face and pulling her hair, there was so much screaming it was getting so wild,' another student told 9news.

'I couldn’t move I was getting pushed around because of how many people were in the fight.'

While the argument originated between two junior students, senior students allegedly involved themselves, including students from year 11.
