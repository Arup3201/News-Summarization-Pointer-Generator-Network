Disgraced presenter Jonathan Ross has been invited to host a BBC primetime television show

Disgraced presenter Jonathan Ross has been invited to host a BBC primetime television show - prompting a barrage of criticism.

The controversial TV host is lined up to present The Secrets of Pinewood, an hour-long programme about the famous film studios, which will air on BBC2 one Saturday night in the spring.

One MP said he wanted to stop paying his licence fee in protest at the decision, whilst the wife of Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs spoke of her ‘disgust’ and ‘astonishment’.

‘If I could cancel my subscription to the BBC over this, I would,’ said John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley.

‘What Jonathan Ross did was really nasty and a very serious abuse of his position as a broadcaster. I wonder what someone would have to do on the BBC to disqualify them [from future appearances].’

Mr Ross was effectively exiled from the Corporation after he crudely mocked Mr Sachs, the Fawlty Towers actor, in 2008. However, the Corporation seems to be trying to reinstate him.

The 54-year old was allowed to present a film awards show on BBC4 in 2010, and has since appeared as a guest on Celebrity Bake Off.

He has also been allowed to stand in for Steve Wright as a host on BBC Radio 2 – the station which aired the original outrage.

Earlier this month, 100 listeners complained about Mr Ross’ return to the BBC airwaves. many also complained on Twitter. One slammed the decision as ‘shameful’, whilst another said it was a ‘disgrace’ to ‘let this clown back on radio’.

Mr Hemming said: ‘I wonder about the judgment of the BBC sometimes. They are supposed to have higher standards than other broadcaster’s…and yet their standards of behaviour are lower than the commercial sector’s.’

Mr Ross telephoned Mr Sachs live on air on BBC Radio 2, and left a lurid message on his answer machine explaining him that the comedian Russell Brand had slept with Mr Sachs’ granddaughter. Mr Brand, who was with Mr Ross at the time, joked that the Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the calls.

Last night, Mr Sachs’ wife Melody said that Mr Ross still made her ‘cringe’ and accused executives of behaving insensitively.

‘I find it astonishing that the BBC now deems him worthy of presenting a documentary on BBC2. I cringe every time I see him on television and I know I’m not alone in doing so.

‘Whoever makes these decisions at the BBC obviously couldn’t care less for the feelings of my family. The irony is that when you look at what my husband has done at the BBC over many years, and then compare it to what Ross has done, there is no question as to who has made the more positive contribution.’

She added that she found it hardest to forgive Mr Ross, for the 2008 episode because he is a family man.

‘Both Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand disgust me because of what they did, but Ross more so because he is a father and a husband who should have known better.’

The original incident provoked 42,000 complaints. Mr Brand later resigned and Mr Ross, who had his own regular Radio 2 show, was suspended for 12 weeks.

He subsequently moved to ITV, while the BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom for the shameful episode.

The Secrets of Pinewood will be aired as one of a string of Saturday night arts specials, endorsed by director-general Tony Hall.

Lord Hall said this morning that they were meant to ‘put arts centre stage’. ‘I strongly believe that arts should be for everyone with more prime time arts content on the BBC,’ he added.

The Corporation defended its decision to have Mr Ross as host of the Pinewood programme.

‘Jonathan Ross is a widely respected film critic who presented BBC One’s Film programme for over a decade,’ a spokesman said.

‘Secrets of Pinewood will see Jonathan go behind the scenes of Britain’s most iconic studios, to explore its rich history and contribution to 80 years of British film. We hope viewers enjoy this special one-off celebration of British cinema.’
