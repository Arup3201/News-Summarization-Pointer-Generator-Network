A mystery shipwreck has been uncovered after fierce storms shifted the sands which had buried it for hundreds of years.

The wreck is only visible for around a few hours a day either side of low water in the shadow of Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland - and first appeared in June.

Since then a team of archaeologists has been studying its timber to try to find out more about the vessel - and tests have now revealed the wood used to build the ship was felled in around 1768.

Dated: Tests have now revealed the wood used to build the mystery ship was felled in around 1768

Built here: A survey found that the ship's timber originates from eastern England, making the ship British

Discovered: A report was conducted on the wreck before funding was secured to undertake further tests

The survey also established that the timber originates from eastern England, making the ship British.

Jessica
 Berry, CEO of the Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust, which has been 
researching the wreck, said: ‘When we first heard the wreck had emerged 
from the sands, we were up there the next day.

‘We
 sat on the beach waiting for the tide to go out. At that point we did 
not know precisely what it was. As it appeared in front of us, it was 
the most incredible sight.’

Jessica Berry, researcher

MAST
 conducted a report on the wreck before funding was secured to undertake
 further tests. Ms Berry added: ‘It has been very exciting to discover 
that the ship is earlier than we first thought.’

The wreck - which was first uncovered 
by storms last winter - lies on Bamburgh beach, in the shadow of the 
castle which dates back to the sixth century.

It is thought that the ship 
could have sailed along the East Coast while Dr John Sharp - recognised 
as being the world's first coastguard - lived in the castle.

In the distance: Survey work to establish the age and origins of the wreck, which lies in the intertidal zone to the south of Bamburgh Castle, was undertaken by researchers

Finding out more: It is thought that the ship could have sailed along the East Coast while Dr John Sharp - recognised as being the world's first coastguard - lived in the castle

Aid: Survey work on the ship was done with the help of a grant from the Northumberland Coat Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Partnership's Sustainable Development Fund

Dr
 Sharp was so concerned for sailors in the treacherous waters around 
Bamburgh that in 1781 he set up what is recognised as the first 
coastguard system in the world.

Determined
 to make safe the perilous seas at Bamburgh, Dr Sharp created a 
pioneering coastguard system which made use of Bamburgh's commanding 
position above the coastline.

He
 turned the castle into a coastguard station, and set up a watch system 
and beach patrols. Massive iron chains were kept at the ready to haul 
floundering ships to safety.

Later, in 1786, Dr Sharp launched the first ever lifeboat at Bamburgh.

The first coastguard at Bamburgh not only warned ships of the coastline - it also provided refuge at the castle for shipwrecked sailors, stored their cargo and buried the dead.

Survey work to establish the age and origins of the wreck, which lies in the intertidal zone to the south of Bamburgh Castle, was undertaken by MAST, with local archaeologists and volunteers.

It was done with the help of a grant from the Northumberland Coat Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Partnership's Sustainable Development Fund.
