Arsenal want talks with PSG about midfielder Adrien Rabiot who is out of contract this summer and can speak to foreign clubs from January.

Rabiot was linked with the Gunners earlier this summer in the French media but it is now believed Arsene Wenger has firmed up his interest in the France Under 21 international.

The 19-year-old is currently contracted to PSG until 2015, but has so far been unable to strike a new deal with Laurent Blanc's side.

Rabiot has played at every level for the French national side - bar the senior side

The 19-year-old is yet to feature for PSG this season after a fall out over his lack of first-team pportunites

The French giants want around £5.6 million for Rabiot's services, with the Gunners keen to make a move as Serie A duo Juventus and Roma are also interested.

Rabiot is keen to move and earlier in the summer saw a move to the latter reportedly fall through.

He has yet to feature for PSG so far this season either after a public fall out over his lack of first-team opportunities at the French giants.
