With her perfectly coiffed locks, smart, tailored dresses and Mulberry handbags, Kim Sears always look immaculately stylish when she watches fiance Andy Murray play at Wimbledon.

But the 26-year-old showcased a more dressed-down look when she watched him win his second round match against Marinko Matosevic on day three of the Australian Open.

The artist from Surrey looked casual in a cropped T-shirt with the slogan 'I Shih Tzu Not' yesterday.

Casual Kim: She wore shorts and a T-shirt with the slogan 'I Shih Tzu Not' on day three of the Australian Open

Budget buy: The dog-themed T-shirt is £16 from online retailer ASOS

The fiancee of Andy Murray still showed their wealth with a £895 Bayswater Mulberry on her arm

Sparkler: Her diamond engagement ring is estimated to be worth £200,000

She teamed her Tee, which is available from ASOS for £16, with white shorts and flat roman sandals. 

Given the temperatures in Australia at this time of year can rise to 40 degrees, it's not surprising that Kim, who is expected to marry Andy in October, opted for cool, summery clothing.

But it's a far cry from her usual look when she takes to the family box at Wimbledon to watch Andy, 27, play.

Wimbledon winner: Kim wore this £925 dress by Victoria Beckham when Andy won the tournament in 2013

Designer day: Kim wore this pink fitted £440 dress from Goat, Burberry wedges and a £1395 Aspinal Marylebone tote bag to the Wimbledon quarter finals in 2014

On those occasions, she has chosen to wear a number of fitted, pretty dresses from a mix of High Street and designer stores.

She's often accessorised with a belt to cinch in her waist and worn heels or Burberry wedges to elongate her figure. 

Her favourite High Street retailers include the more expensively priced Hobbs, Ted Baker, Zara and Reiss - stores also favoured by another English style icon, the Duchess of Cambridge.

Kim's most expensive outfit worn to Wimbledon was a mint, £925 crochet dress by Victoria Beckham which she wore when Andy won the grand slam in 2013.

Smart: For the Wimbledon final in 2012 she looked like she could be headed to the office in this high-waisted skirt, white blouse, wedges and Mulberry Bayswater bag

At the final the year before, when the outcome had been quite different for Andy as he lost to Roger Federer, she had dressed smartly in a fitted high-waisted skirt and white blouse with leopard print wedges. 

She's never without her collection of designer handbags as she either has her £895 Bayswater Mulberry, £1,500 Mulberry Willow Tote or £1,100.00 Mulberry Alexa on her arm. At Wimbledon last year, she was rarely seen without her Aspinal Marylebone tote bag - which costs an eye-watering £1395.  

The tailored looks contrast to Kim's more laidback appearance down under yesterday - perhaps chosen as she feels she isn't as much in the lime light when her fiance isn't playing in front of a home crowd.

Another dress from Hobbs, the £129 'Ada' worn to the Wimbledon semi finals in 2013

Her outfit still had a hint of glamour thanks to her carrying her Bayswater Mulberry and dazzling engagement ring, thought to be worth £200,000.

Kim shared a picture of her T-shirt on her Instragram account with the caption: 'My current clothing obsession #shihtzu #asos.'

She usually uses the account to show off her own drawings of dogs as she works part-time doing pet portraits. 

At Wimbledon 2012, she wore this long sleeve navy dress with co-coordinating belt and Mulberry bag
