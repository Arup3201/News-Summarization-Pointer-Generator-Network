These dramatic photographs show the moment an out-of-control £40,000 Jaguar smashed into two cars before shunting another car with such force it ploughed through a brick wall.

The bizarre incident unfolded in a private members' club car park in Stourbridge, West Midlands, today, when the driver of a silver Jaguar XF apparently lost control of his vehicle.

His luxury car, which had a personalised number plate, reportedly clipped a barrier before crashing into a parked car and later into the back of a stationary purple Renault.

The unusual incident unfolded in a private members' club car park in Stourbridge, West Midlands, earlier today

The force of the impact sent the Renault through a wall before its front end plunged six foot into the neighbouring Tesco car park. 

It is thought the owner of the mangled burgundy car was shopping in the town at the time of the incident and was unaware of the drama. 

Police and ambulance crews were called to the scene at about 1pm and two people were treated for minor injuries.

West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed paramedics tended to the two people but said they were both discharged at the scene and didn't require further treatment. 

The service was unable to confirm whether both patients were occupants of the Jaguar.

Witness David Holing, 50, said: 'It was crazy. This silver car barrelled through the car park like something out of the Dukes of Hazzard.

'It hit one parked car and cannoned off into the back of the Renault which shot through the wall like a bullet.

'It's just so lucky the car park wasn't busier and no one got in the way because it could have been a very different story.'

It is believed the £40,000 Jaguar belonged to one of the members of the nearby private members' club 

The driver of the Jaguar is believed to long-standing member of the private members' club.

Ron Peplow, chairman of Stourbridge institute who own the car park, added: 'It's very fortunate no-one was going down the ramp at the time.

'The fire service had been alerted as fuel was believed to be leaking from the vehicle.'

West Midlands Police said the collision was 'damage-only' but refused to comment further on the incident.
