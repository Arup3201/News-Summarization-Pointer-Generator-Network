A couple has been charged after they were allegedly caught having sex in full view of children at a pediatrics office.

Juliet Ruffner Bender, 39, and James Albert Mapstone, 45 were arrested after an employee at the doctor's office called police to report the children had seen the pair 'rolling around'.

Both were charged with disorderly intoxication after the incident at Evening Pediatrics in St Petersburg, Florida on Saturday night, Pinellas County deputies said.

Both Bender and Mapstone were 'cursing and causing a disturbance', according to the Tampa Bay Times. Ms Bender was released on bond of $100 bond by authorities.

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.

It was not the first time that Bender has had a run-in with police. Last January she was charged with selling drugs, crashing a vehicle and property damage.

Evening Pediatrics is a walk-in clinic that remains open until 11pm each night and treats patients from newborns up to the age of 21.
