A drunk teenager who broke a policeman's leg leg in a brutal late-night attack outside a city centre nightclub after going 'berserk' has been jailed for 28 months.

Mohammed Labead, 19, seriously injured PC Lee Wilson, 42, as he went to the aid of colleague Sgt Rachael Shearing after an assault on a girl.

Labead, of Norwich, yesterday admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on PC Wilson without intent on January 19 this year.

Labead also admitted a count of assault by beating over Sgt Shearing and another assault by beating on the same night.

Guy Ayers, prosecuting, said trouble erupted as a crowd of young women gathered late at night outside Mojo's club in Norwich.

Mr Ayers said Labead and his friends were 'boisterous' and 'aggressive' towards them.

The 19-year-old grabbed one of the girls with both hands to the face and pushed her backwards.

Mr Ayers said she was 'rightened' and 'distraught' and had one of her earrings yanked out.

Sgt Shearing dashed to the scene but was verbally abused by Labead.

They scuffled and PC Wilson went to help her, Norwich Crown Court heard.

Mr Ayers said the PC Wilson, who has 23 years experience, found Labead 'extremely aggressive' and was 'frightened' by his 'level of aggression'.

PC Wilson was wrestled to the ground as he fought to restrain Labead and suffered a badly broken leg.

It was a vertical fracture to the right tibia which required major surgery including the fitting of a metal pin to stabilise the break.

The assault was captured on CCTV.

Mr Ayers said Labead had no previous convictions but had a caution for assaulting a constable in 2013.

PC Wilson read out an emotional victim impact statement in court.

He said his recovery had been 'slow' and 'painful' and he suffered pain every day as a result of being attacked.

Norwich-based PC Wilson said: 'Due to my age, both my physiotherapist and doctor have intimated it is likely I will suffer from arthritis in the knee within 10 years which will undoubtedly affect my career.'

He said the attack had an impact on his two-year-old daughter and five-year-old son.

'My son knows his daddy is a police officer, he sees me as indestructible - it was hard to see him so upset when he saw that I'd been hurt.

'In the first few weeks after leaving hospital I was unable to climb the stairs to tuck them into bed, read a bedtime story and worst of all, unable to comfort my son after his nightmares of daddy being "hurt by that bad man".'

Judge Stephen Holt jailed Labead for 28 months in a young offenders institution.

Judge Holt told the court: 'He is a police officer out there in the community doing his duty, keeping us, the public, safe and police officers must expect and will get support from the courts in these sorts of cases.'

Matthew McNiff, defending, said Labead felt 'sick', 'saddened' and 'ashamed'.

Mr McNiff said he pleaded guilty at the first opportunity to what was a 'drunken, stupid reaction not a drunken, deliberate action'.

He said Labead was young and 'deeply immature' and insisted there was a 'lack of premeditation'.

Speaking after the hearing, PC Wilson welcomed the sentence. 'I've served as a police officer for 23 years, suffered bruises and broken ribs but nothing like this.

'It was completely uncalled for - he just went berserk,' he said.

PC Wilson suffered a vertical fracture of the right tibia, left, which required a major operation. Orthopaedic surgeons were forced to install a metal pin into PC Wilson's leg, right, to stabalise the unusual break

'There is no justification for that level of violence, especially against people who are there to protect genuine members of the public who want to have a safe and enjoyable night out.

'The majority of people want to have a safe night out but with some people there's been a noticeable decline in the attitude towards police.

'Nothing appears to be off-limits from verbal abuse to spitting to being assaulted.

'This type of behaviour is dealt with robustly but we shouldn't need to when all we're there to do is ensure people have a safe night out.'

Supt Dave Marshall, of Norfolk Police, said last night: 'It's distressing to see one of your officers injured and with such severity in this case.

'We accept, with the job we do, there will be occasions where you suffer injuries but not to this extent.

'PC Wilson was simply trying to do his job and help a colleague when Labead lashed out, injuring both officers.

'Labead has quite rightly received a custodial sentence for such an aggressive response to our presence while trying to resolve a separate dispute.

'Hopefully this case demonstrates that violence in the night time economy, whether towards a member of the public or a police officer, is not acceptable.'

Temporary Norfolk Assistant Chief Constable, Nick Dean, said: 'Officers on the frontline routinely face danger - it's the nature of the job.

'However, to attack anyone in this way, including a police officer, is a serious matter and the sentence shows the courts will not tolerate such despicable behaviour.'
