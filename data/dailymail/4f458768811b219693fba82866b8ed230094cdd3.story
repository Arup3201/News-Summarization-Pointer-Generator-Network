A 16-year-old was barred from playing school sports after posting a tweet that said he would ‘drill’ his opponents.

Tyson Leon, a keen football player and wrestler at Shakopee High School in Minnesota, wrote in August this year: ‘Im boutta drill my “teammates” on Monday.'

The school district interrupted this as a direct threat to his teammates and he was suspended from playing sport.

A letter sent to Leon said that ‘threatening to harm members of the football team’ was one of the reasons for his punishment, along with swearing at the football coach, damaging a door and having previous suspensions for poor conduct in sports.

However,  the student insisted that his tweet was merely a statement of intent about tackling his opponents hard during the practice session and was a well-known football term.

He has now been reinstated in the football team after the matter was put before a federal judge, who ruled in Leon’s favour.

His attorney, Meg Kane, said that his rights to freedom of speech, privacy and his right to be free from unlawful seizure had all been violated, according to The San Francisco Chronicle.

After the hearing, Leon, who hopes to win a college wrestling scholarship, told KARE 11 News: ‘Justice was on my side today. I’m happy that the judge was able to see that it was wrong what they were doing.'

And he later tweeted: ‘I just want to thank everyone who has been supporting me and have been corner during this time in my life.’
