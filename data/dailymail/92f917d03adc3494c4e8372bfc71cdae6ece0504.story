A fascinating 18th Century ‘prenup’ between Napoleon Bonaparte and his first wife Josephine is set to be auctioned in Paris.

It suggests that the legendary couple, who married in 1796, were just as concerned about protecting their personal wealth as any rich man and wife living today.

The contract will be auctioned in the French capital on September 21th, and is expected to go for up to £80,000.

I aint sayin' she a golddigger: A ‘prenup’ between Napoleon Bonaparte and his first wife Josephine de Beauharnais is set to fetch £80,000 at auction

Not only did both Josephine and Napoleon lie about their age in the documents, but they failed to disclose assets in case they had to divide them following a separation.

The contract states that the pair will ‘in no way be responsible for the debts and mortgages of the other’ and that there will be ‘no common property’.

Josephine was six years older than her lover – something that was likely to provoke a scandal at the time, because she would have been expected to produce an heir.

Josephine de Beauharnais was also a widow well known for her passionate affairs with a number of men when she became Napoleon’s mistress in 1795.

He was 26 at the time, and already a brilliantly successful military commander who would go on to become Emperor of France.

The national hero was very wary of 
losing his growing wealth, as was Josephine, who had been married to 
Alexandre de Beauharnais, an aristocrat guillotined during the French 
Revolution.

A law of 1795 
allowed Josephine to reclaim her dead husband’s assets, and she was 
determined to hang on with them, along with her two children.

Napoleon's
 mother and sisters were particularly resentful of his marriage to 
Josephine, because she made them feel unsophisticated.

It
 was for these reasons that an old fashioned version of the prenuptial 
agreement was signed by both on March 8, 1796, the day before their 
wedding.

Although nothing 
like as complicated as it would be today ‘it is a contract which is full
 of anecdotes,’ said Jean-Christophe Chataignier, of auctioneers Osenat.

‘It may look simple - you 
have all the normal artefacts you'd find in a marriage contract, but 
when you study it closely it gives us lots of information about how 
things might be divided.’

As
 it turned out, the marriage lasted less than a decade and was annulled 
by the Pope when Josephine failed to give Napoleon children.

The relationship was often used by the British to mock Napoleon, along with his relatively small height.

‘Boney’
 was meant to have regularly said ‘Not tonight, Josephine’ because he 
could not keep up with Josephine's sexual demands, but this is in fact a
 myth.
