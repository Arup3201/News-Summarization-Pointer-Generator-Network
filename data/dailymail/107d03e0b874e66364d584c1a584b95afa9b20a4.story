Once inside the premises, the gunmen stole a number of valuable items.

Mr Eaton left Seek to return to his home country of Kenya to start a new car portal business, Cheki, under the One Africa Media online marketplace group, of which he was a co-founder.

The company employed more than 150 staff and is the biggest car portal in Kenya.

At the time of his death, Mr Eaton had been living in the Kenyan capital.

The tragic death of the father-of-four was confirmed in a post on One Africa Media’s blog:

'Carey was intelligent and bold but wielded this gift with a humility that gave all around him the confidence to achieve more than they knew was possible. However, it is not Carey the business leader that we will miss as much as Carey the man: energetic, passionate and connected to us all in some special way,' reads the post.

'What can never be taken away is the legacy around us in the team and the brands that he built. When we have mourned the loss of our friend we will, with renewed resolve, get back to building his vision into a great legacy. In celebration of his life.'

Mr Eaton leaves behind his wife Steph, and children Noah, ILola, Ted and Archie.
