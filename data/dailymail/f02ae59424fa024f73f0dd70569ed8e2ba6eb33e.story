The United States Geological Survey says the rate of earthquakes in Oklahoma has increased by about 50% since October 2013, significantly increasing the chance for a damaging quake in central Oklahoma.

In a statement by the U.S. Geological Survey and Oklahoma Geological Survey, the agencies reported that 183 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater occurred from October 2013 through April 14.

This compares with an average of only two magnitude 3.0 or larger earthquakes per year from 1978 to 2008.

A senior adviser from the USGS says he hopes the new advisory will become a crucial consideration in earthquake preparedness for residents, schools and businesses in the central Oklahoma area.

The United States Geological Survey says the number of earthquakes in Oklahoma has gone up dramatically. It says the surge in seismic activity is due in part to and that it has increased the danger of a damaging quake in the central part of the state

The statement indicates that a likely factor in the increase in earthquakes is wastewater injection used for fracking.

'We haven't seen this before in Oklahoma, so we had some concerns about putting a specific number on the chances of it,' Robert Williams, a research geophysicist with the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program in Golden, Colorado, told Live Science.

'But we know from other cases around the world that if you have an increasing number of small earthquakes, the chances of a larger one will go up.'

That's why earthquakes of magnitude 5 and larger are more frequent in states such as California and Alaska, where thousands of smaller temblors hit every year.

This is the first time the USGS has issued an earthquake warning for a state east of the Rockies, Williams said. Such seismic hazard assessments are more typically issued for Western states following large quakes, to warn residents of the risk of damaging aftershocks, he said.

The geological agencies took action after the rate of earthquakes in Oklahoma outpaced that of even California for the first few months of 2014.

'The rate of earthquakes increased dramatically in March and April,' Williams said.

'That alerted us to examine this further and put out this advisory statement.'

While Oklahoma's buildings can withstand light earthquakes, the damage from a magnitude-5 temblor could be widespread.

Oklahoma's last major earthquake was in November 2011, when a magnitude-5.6 earthquake centered near Prague, Oklahoma, destroyed 14 homes and injured at least two people.

'Building owners and government officials should have a special concern for older, unreinforced brick structures, which are vulnerable to serious damage during sufficient shaking,' Bill Leith, a USGS senior science adviser for earthquakes and geologic hazards, said in the joint statement.

The result of the increased number of small and moderate shocks is the likelihood of future damaging for central and north-central Oklahoma, geologists say
