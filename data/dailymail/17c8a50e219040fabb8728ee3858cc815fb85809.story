A mother-of-three ended up with a $145 fine after being spotted by a police officer carrying out her threat to call Santa in a bid to force her children to behave

A mother ended up with a bit more than she bargained for when she carried out her threat to call Santa.

With three brawling children in the back of her car the frazzled mother picked up her mobile phone and dialed Saint Nick.

But the pretend call asking for her daughters, aged two, four and six, to be put on the naughty list landed the woman with a $145 fine.

She was spotted explaining to Father Christmas that her girls' had been disrespectful by a police patrolman, who pulled her over for using her mobile. 

'I'm guessing I'm the first person to ever get a ticket for talking to Santa Claus,' she told The Trentonian. 

The fed up mother, known only as Rachel, said that her two youngest were fighting and refusing to listen to her when she decided to carry out her threat.

She was in mid-flow to Santa when she passed a police car hiding behind and church and threw her phone to the ground.

Three miles later the mother, who had recently moved to Monroe, Louisiana, US, was pulled over by the officer.

 'I told the officer my girls weren't behaving and that I had to call Santa Claus,' the woman told The Trentonian.

'I was trying to make him understand without giving it up. And he's just looking at me like I'm crazy.' 

It was only when the officer checked the call log that he realised the woman had not been using her phone to make a call.

But she was not out of the woods. A second officer arrived at the scene in Helmetta, New Jersey, and discovered that she had missed a car inspection.

The new officer initially wanted seize her car before being talked round by his colleague.

The woman was allowed to leave with her car and a $145 ticket. 

The police officer accepted that the woman was not really talking on her phone, but she was still fined after it was discovered she had missed a car inspection (file picture)
