A desperate son from India has kept his mentally ill father and brother chained for 20 years because he couldn’t afford to get them medical treatment.

Dinesh Kaurav, 35, has kept his 65-year-old father Churaman and his brother Suresh, 21, chained because he claims they had become a danger to themselves and others.

They were diagnosed with mental health issues in 1994. As the eldest son the responsibility of their care fell on Dinesh and he tried to get medical help from the government.

The father and son were chained up after they became aggressive and medical treatment couldn't be afforded

Churaman Kaurav, 65, and his son Suresh, 21, were diagnosed with mental health issues in 1994

Dinesh Kaurav said he had no choice to keep them chained as he did not have enough money to buy medicine

But eventually he said the pair began to get aggressive and Dinesh felt he had no choice but keep them safe by chaining them inside their home, in a remote village, in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.

Dinesh said: ‘I tried my best to have my father and brother treated at government hospitals, but I did not have enough money to buy medicines.

‘Then they were becoming aggressive and it was difficult for us to take care of them. They would pelt stones at villagers and sometimes walk out of the house and go missing. It was for their safety that I thought to chain them otherwise they may hurt themselves or others. I had no other choice.’

Even though the father and son are chained, Dinesh and his mother, Naram, 60, take care of them every minute of every day and feed and bath them daily.

Dinesh added: ‘While I’m at work my mother keeps an eye on them. She helps them with everything, we never leave them alone.  They spend their days sleeping but sometimes we leave them free to move from the bedroom to the backyard.’

He tried to get help from the government's district administration but it refused

But now thanks to village help and protests, the administration has assured help in the nearest hospital

Dinesh works as a daily labourer, picking up work where he can, earning about 3,000 Rs a month (£30). He lives in a two-room house with his wife, mother and mentally ill father and son.

Dinesh had tried to get help from the government’s District Administration but they refused any financial aid.

But thanks to village support and protests the administration has now stepped in and has assured their assistance with medical care in the nearest specialized hospital.

Rajesh Shah, a local government officer, said: 'The family came to us for help because they couldn’t pay for medical treatment, that's when we included them in the government’s list for subsidies. But if Dinesh needs further help, we will be here to help as much as we can.'
