An unemployed father-of-26 branded Britain's most feckless father has previous convictions for drugs offences, drink driving and anti-social behaviour, it emerged today.

Peter Rolfe, who has 14 daughters and 12 sons by 15 women and says he rakes in £46,000-a-year-in welfare handouts, has been convicted of a string of offences but has always avoided prison.

The 64-year-old, who has been married at least seven times, was cleared of bigamy over his 1997 wedding to Claire Drake when the CPS dropped the case ahead of trial for 'insufficient evidence'.

His criminal record began at the age of ten and also includes using threatening behaviour, drink driving and having eight children in the back of his van.

Father-of-26 Peter Rolfe has caused fury among neighbours by getting a five-bedroom council house. It emerged today that he has a string of convictions for anti-social behaviour and drugs offences

Rolfe has dodged jail since 1987 partly because he has so many children to care for.

In 2005, a police raid on Rolfe's home in Newport on the Isle of Wight found amphetamines in his freezer, cannabis in his kitchen and stolen Marks & Spencer bedding and clothing.

Judge John Dixon told Rolfe: 'You are 53 and have had a working life of offences. The latest are yet another step in an utterly dismal history of which you should be ashamed.'

But after considering the welfare of Rolfe's children, he handed him an 18-month community rehabilitation order at Isle of Wight Crown Court.

In 2004, Rolfe was given a two year conditional discharge by magistrates on the island for having ammunition - bullets - without a licence.

He told police he found them in a box of drill bits he had bought at a car boot sale.

Later that year at the same court, he admitted threatening behaviour against a shop supervisor.

Magistrates heard that Rolfe had already made 33 previous court appearances and had a criminal history going back 44 years, but he was given another conditional discharge for nine months.

He has since made at least four more court appearances.

Rolfe - who moved into the house with seven of his children and two grandchildren - has always dodged prison sentences partly by claiming he needs to look after his children

In 2004, he was also evicted from a housing association property after a dossier of anti-social behaviour was presented to Isle of Wight county court.

A Newport GP said that a rise in mental and physical illness among patients was 'directly linked to the actions of Rolfe and his family'.

Rolfe recently outraged other residents by landing a five bedroom, taxpayer-funded house in Newport.

Last year, he appeared on Channel 5's Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole and ITV's This Morning.

The single dad claimed on TV that he deserves the £500,000 plus in benefits that he has raked in during over 20 years that he has been unemployed.

At that time, none of Mr Rolfe's children, who range in age from four to 43, were in work.

Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe branded him Britain's most feckless father and said he does not deserve a tent, let alone a council house.

Rolfe's ex-wife has claimed 'he will carry on having more kids if he finds anyone stupid enough'

Ex-wife Claire Drake, 43, had six children with Rolfe in seven years after meeting him in 1992.

The barmaid said: 'I had to get away. He's just evil. He should be castrated. He will carry on having more kids if he finds anyone stupid enough.

'It is absolutely disgusting the amount he receives in benefits while I am working for a roof over my head.

'I have nothing but hate for that man. When I watched him on 'This Morning', I was shaking; my legs were going; and I was sweating. He makes my skin crawl.'

Their six children lived with Rolfe from 2001. He moved into his new house with six of his children and two grandchildren after complaining to the council that his previous three bedroom semi was 'like a prison'.

But daughter Leeanne is already moving out into her own welfare-funded flat with her one-year-old twins Lexi and Courtney and fiancé Danny Beck.

Asked about his 46-year criminal record, Rolfe said: 'My convictions are all in the past and nothing whatsoever to do with these children.

'I took these children under my care in 2001. I have turned my life around. I am ashamed of my past - of course I am.'

This family tree shows the size of Rolfe's huge brood, nine of whom moved into the house with him
