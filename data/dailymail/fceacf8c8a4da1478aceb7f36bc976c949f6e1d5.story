A man has been handcuffed 200m from the Martin Place cafe siege in central Sydney, with a police officer placing his foot on what appeared to be a small black handgun. 

A police spokeswoman said the incident was not related to the ongoing siege.

Witnesses today described how a man wearing a headband covered in Arabic walked into the Lindt cafe in Martin Place and produced a shotgun from a blue bag at around 9.45am.

A man was arrested by police near the scene of the tense standoff in the heart of the CBD

Heavily armed police have swarmed the Sydney CBD and much of the city has gone into lockdown following the crisis

The hostages placed a black flag with white Islamic writing in the window of their Martin Place siege site

Hostages were seen lined in the windows of the Lindt Cafe - which is just across the road from the Seven Network

Shortly afterwards hostages were seen with their hands pressed against the windows holding up the Shahada flag belonging to the extremist group Jabhat al-Nusra, which is fighting the Assad government in Syria.

There are claims that the terrorists are also armed with a machete and may have explosives but this has not been confirmed by police.

One of the hostage-takers has made contact with officers saying that he has 'devices all over the city' and 'wants to speak with the prime minister live on radio', according to Ray Hadley, from 2GB.

Armed police sealed off streets around the cafe and Martin Place station is shut. Planes have been diverted away from the city centre. 

The incident began just hours after a 25-year-old suspect was arrested in a terror raid in Sydney.

Officials have also evacuated the Opera House after reports of a suspicious device.
