Jailed: Jennifer Philp-Parsons was jailed for two-and-a-half years after sleeping with two teenage boys

A married music teacher had alcohol-fuelled sex sessions with two boys from her school.

Jennifer Philp-Parsons, a mother-of-three, invited the 16-year-olds to parties at her house, where she plied them with drinks.

The 45-year-old had sex with one boy in the living room while her husband slept upstairs. On another occasion she slept  with two different boys in the space of one hour while her spouse was away.

Police believe she may have seduced other pupils and Judge Francis Gilbert QC told Exeter Crown Court the teacher was ‘sordid and adulterous’.

He told her she had committed ‘very serious offences involving seducing two of the students in your school in your own home for your own sexual gratification’.

The judge added: ‘On the first occasion you plied them with drink when your husband was upstairs.

‘On the second you had sexual intercourse with both boys in a short space  of time … You have left a trail of destruction and significant distress for a number of people.’

The court heard how Philp-Parsons, who was head of music at a school in Devon, became the 16-year-olds’ favourite teacher, befriending them during lessons.

After gaining their trust she hosted parties at her home in Exmouth, where she would provide her pupils with alcohol. It was during one of these house parties that she first had sex with a pupil.

Emily Pitts, prosecuting, told the court: ‘The boy was alone with the defendant while he was watching a film on her sofa bed.

‘She
pulled up his T-shirt and stroked his stomach while commenting on his 
physique. She touched him and she removed his clothing, they began 
kissing and they had sexual intercourse.’

At
another party at her home just weeks later, ‘drinking games took place 
and towards the end of the evening three boys were in the defendant’s 
bedroom’, Miss Pitts added. ‘Two boys left leaving [the original victim]
alone with the defendant...  and they had sexual intercourse.’

The
court heard that less than an hour later, when the victim and a friend 
left to buy food at around 1am, Philp-Parsons began to seduce a second 
boy.

After performing a sex 
act on him she took him upstairs and slept with him. Miss Pitts said of 
the second victim: ‘He felt pressured because it was her house and he 
did not want to do it, but did not know what else to do.’

Philp-Parsons was arrested at the school after a member of the public reported rumours to the police. 

She initially denied the charges but confessed during a second interview.

The
court was told that she refused to recognise the gravity of her 
situation even after her arrest and continued to send text messages to 
one of the 16-year-olds. One read: ‘Hi darling, I have missed you lots.’
Another said: ‘Please forgive me.’

Defending
the teacher, Richard Crabb said: ‘She was experiencing difficulties in 
her marriage, she felt lonely and isolated at home.

‘She began to look for friendship and support from her students which was a foolish and dangerous thing to do.’

Mr Crabb added: ‘She knows it was wrong and she utterly regrets what she did at the parties.’

One
of the boys’ families said they had been left ‘heartbroken, utterly 
shocked and disgusted by her lust and sexual needs’ and said it ‘was 
every parent’s worst nightmare’. The other victim’s family said they had
been left ‘sick, devastated and destroyed by her selfish and perverted 
needs’.

Philp-Parsons admitted three counts of sexual activity with males aged between 13 and 17 while in a position of trust.

Her husband of 18 years was in court yesterday as she was sentenced to 30 months in jail.

A police source said: ‘We think there may be more victims out there and would urge them to come forward to talk to us.’
