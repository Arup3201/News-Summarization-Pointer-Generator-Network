Chris Martin is set to join Jennifer Lawrence in London at the world premiere of her new film Mockingjay on Monday night, MailOnline has been told.

The Coldplay frontman, 37 - who reportedly split from the stunning Oscar winner late last month - will accompany the actress to the event, but will NOT join her on the red carpet.

Instead, a film source said he will do his 'usual, fly-under-the-radar thing that he used to do with Gwyneth Paltrow'.

The singer is expected at the premiere of the latest Hunger Games movie days after it was reported that Jennifer had dumped him. 

Is it back on? Chris Martin looked contemplative in LA on Tuesday. Sources say that while Jennifer Lawrence is being 'uncharacteristically quiet', the Coldplay frontman will join her in London on Monday night

However, the actress was seen arriving his Malibu home on October 27 - just hours after news broke that the couple had split - for what was described as a 'heart to heart' with Martin.

She returned three nights later, on Thursday, October 30, and is believed to have been with Martin since the weekend.

And a source said: 'They've mostly been holed up at Chris's house, and there were rumors that they were at one of Jen's regular haunts, Chateau Marmont, earlier in the week.

'Jennifer hasn't been talking about it - she's been uncharacteristically quiet about the whole thing.

'Chris is meant to be going with her to London to the Hunger Games world premiere. But he won't make a public appearance.'

Coldplay have an art exhibition to benefit the Kids Company charity and European promotion for their Ghost Stories Blu-Ray, so their plans dovetail neatly.

It is, the source admitted, a far cry from last week, when Jen was 'adamant it was all over', adding: 'But she tends to move on fast in these matters.

'Her personal life seems to be in flux, but she's not letting all that is happening affect her promotional duties for Mockingjay.'

As MailOnline told last week, Jennifer is about to embark on a six-week promotional tour - but 'intense' Martin was keen to spend all this time with her.

A friend said: 'There was a discrepancy between how they viewed their relationship, she’s so easy going and he’s quite intense.’ 

Indeed, Jennifer is said to have left Martin 'completely blindsided' by calling off their four-month romance, as the friend said: ‘Jen is contractually obliged for the next six weeks to promote Mockingjay and she just couldn’t see how it was going to work. ‘

After London, Jennifer will fly to New York and on to Los Angeles before embarking on a huge promo tour in Asia for Mockingjay. Chris won't join her for the Asian leg, but will see her while she's in London and LA.

The pair went out separately on Friday, with Jennifer 'having a great time' at Justin Timberlake and Jennifer Biel's Halloween party, while Martin went trick-or-treating in Malibu with his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow and their children Apple, 10, and Moses, eight.

On Saturday, Jennifer was spotted driving to Martin's Malibu house again.

Although one source told People that the pair have indeed split, another insider says they remain an item, adding: 'They're very much together.

'He's very much into her and they're still seeing each other.'

Spokespeople for Jennifer and Martin have so far declined to comment. 

As for reports that Jennifer was upset by Martin's continuing closeness to his ex-wife, an insider told People: 'She doesn't give a s**t about Gwyneth [and Chris's relationship],' adding that the star thinks the reports are 'hilarious'.
