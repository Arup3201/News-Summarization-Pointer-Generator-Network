A group of West Bromwich Albion youngsters were on the receiving end of a cracking practical  joke on Friday.

First-team duo Ben Foster and Craig Gardner pelted the youth players with eggs as they lined up for a team photo at the training ground.

England international Foster and his partner-in-crime Gardner hid from their unsuspecting victims before emerging on to a balcony and unleashing their egg-throwing attack.

The England goalkeeper posted a video of the incident on Instagram and took to Twitter to apologise and congratulate his team-mate's accuracy.

'Sorry young lads!! @craiggards8 what a shot!!! #boom #headshot' Foster Tweeted.

It is little wonder spirits are high at the Hawthorns at the moment after West Brom recovered from a tough start to life under Alan Irvine by winning three of their last four matches.

The Baggies were narrowly beaten 2-1 by Liverpool before the international break, but won the three previous games against Burnley, Hull and Tottenham.

Next up for West Brom in the Premier League is Louis van Gaal's Manchester United, where they will be hoping to leave the United players with egg on their faces.
