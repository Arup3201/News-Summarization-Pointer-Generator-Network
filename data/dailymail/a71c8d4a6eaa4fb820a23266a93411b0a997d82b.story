Lots of us think we’re doing well if we make time to exfoliate our faces. Now hair experts want us to start scrubbing our scalps, too.

A number of big brands have added exfoliating shampoos and scalp masks to their ranges, while several top treatment centres offer scalp ‘facials’. But what do they actually do?

Scrubbing up well: Scalp exfoliators clear away troublesome dandruff and take years off your locks

‘The scalp is much like the skin, but with more oil glands and hair follicles,’ says trichologist Philip Kingsley.

‘This means that sebum and dead skin cells can build up, causing oiliness and flaking, particularly if you’re prone to dermatitis or psoriasis.’

But scalp exfoliators won’t just clear away troublesome dandruff — they could take years off your locks, too.

‘A build-up of sebum and dead skin cells blocks the pores, and leads to increased shedding,’ says Kingsley.

‘In fact, this is one of the key reasons hair thins as we age. Cell turnover slows with age so dead cells need help to be scrubbed away. Exfoliating the scalp once a week will clear away this build-up.’

It also means your usual products will be more effective, as they’ll be better able to penetrate the follicles. Just don’t over do it.

‘If you’ve got a sensitive scalp it’s best to avoid coarse exfoliants, which can be abrasive and irritate the skin,’ says Kingsley.

‘Look for products that contain salicylic acid or fruit enzymes, as these gently soften dead skin so it can be rinsed rather than scrubbed away.’

As someone with a dry, flaky but super-sensitive scalp, I’m a little apprehensive about putting any of these products near my hair, but the promise of glossy, younger-looking locks is enough to make me reconsider. So, which are worth trying?

Aveda Invati Exfoliating Shampoo, £20 for 200ml, lookfantastic.com

INGREDIENTS: Salicylic acid is said to reduce the build-up of dead cells, and turmeric and ginseng are there to speed up cell turnover. This botanical shampoo promises stronger, thicker-looking hair.

HOW TO USE IT: Like a normal shampoo, and then condition and style as usual.

VERDICT: The shampoo is an unappealing brown colour and smells slightly medicated. It didn’t create much foam, even from a good palm-sized amount. My scalp was wonderfully clean, although my hair, which is curly, felt a little too dry for my liking. Still, there was no flakiness. A qualified success.

SCORE: 7/10

Alterna Caviar Exfoliating Scalp Facial, £32 for 85ml, amazon.co.uk

INGREDIENTS: Contains a concentrated dose of active fruit enzymes to break down cells, and exfoliating micro-beads for the scrub. It also contains caviar extract, which is said to be nourishing.

HOW TO USE IT: Once a week, apply it before your shampoo, then condition and style  as normal.

VERDICT: The granular gel is a cinch to apply thanks to the bristle head of the brush applicator, which gives a heavenly head massage.

And best of all, my locks didn’t feel at all dry afterwards. A clear scalp — and, for me, a clear winner. Not even a tiny bit of flakiness.

SCORE: 10/10

Philip Kingsley Exfoliating Scalp Mask, £6 for 20ml, johnlewis.com

INGREDIENTS: Containing salicylic and moisturising plant oils to moisturise, this gentle mask is designed to also soothe the scalp.

HOW TO USE IT: Once a week before shampooing. Condition as normal.

VERDICT: Completely smooth and odourless, it doesn’t feel as abrasive as other products containing salicylic acid.

The instructions recommend conditioning your hair at the same time, so I apply the exfoliator to my roots and my favourite hair mask through the ends and sit it out for  20 minutes.

Afterwards, my scalp feels like it can breathe in the same way that your face glows  after exfoliation. My hair seems lighter somehow. There is no trace of my usual flakiness and my scalp is completely itch-free.

SCORE: 8/10

Ouidad Mediterranean Bay Leaf Exfoliating Hair And Scalp Treatment, £28.25 for 178ml, beautybay.co.uk

INGREDIENTS: The cream is infused with natural fruit enzymes to soften skin cells, as well as a gentle bamboo scrub.

HOW TO USE IT: The directions advise massaging into the scalp, two to three times a week, but it did leave my hair a bit dry, so I would advise using an extra dollop of conditioner afterwards.

VERDICT: The Ouidad range is designed especially for wavy, curly hair. The herbal-scented lotion was grainy but not quite as gritty as the others, so didn’t feel quite as exfoliating, although I enjoyed the three-minute massage. My scalp was thoroughly cleansed, but my hair felt a little dry.

SCORE: 6.5/10 

Kiehls Deep Micro-Exfoliating Scalp Treatment, £20 for 100ml, kiehls.co.uk

INGREDIENTS: Contains finely-ground apricot seed and argan shell for the scrub, and menthol to increase blood flow to the scalp.

HOW TO USE IT: Apply once a week after shampooing.

VERDICT: I loved the scrubbing sensation, not to mention the cooling zing of mint.

My scalp was left with a lovely tingling feeling afterwards and it didn’t dry my hair out either. This seemed to soothe rather than irritate my sensitive scalp, earning it a place in my bathroom cabinet.
