James Wilson was on target but Manchester United missed the opportunity to regain top spot in the Under 21 Premier League as they were beaten by Leicester City on Monday night.

Jack Barmby's stoppage time winner inflicted United's first defeat of the season as the Foxes lifted themselves off the bottom of the table.

The defeat - inflicted by a former Old Trafford academy product in Barmby - leaves United trailing their Manchester rivals City by a point at the top, though they still have two matches in hand.

18-year-old hotshot Wilson, who came on for Robin van Persie late in Sunday's Manchester derby, found the net after only eight minutes at Leigh after a smart one-two with Saidy Janko.

His clinical left-foot finish will once again give Louis van Gaal reasons to believe Wilson is up to leading the line in the first team.

Leicester, who had shown their class in a 6-2 rout of Man City recently, responded strongly and Ben Amos was required to make saves from Marc Albrighton and Jak McCourt.

At the other end, United skipper Tom Thorpe, who could be called upon to fill in at centre-half for Van Gaal's team following Chris Smalling's suspension and Marcos Rojo's suspension, showed his offensive qualities by striking the outside of the post following an Andreas Pereira corner.

The visitors equalised on 37 minutes when Joe Dodoo rounded off a slick move that involved Anthony Knockaert by rolling an accurate shot past Amos.

Leicester were dominant and Tom Hopper forced an excellent save from Amos with a shot that deflected off Thorpe, before a Knockaert free-kick rattled the crossbar when the United goalkeeper tipped the ball onto it.

United manager Louis van Gaal may have to call upon more of his young players in the weeks to come

A goal seemed inevitable and City led at half-time thanks to Albrighton's unstoppable shot from a half-cleared corner.

United needed a response and it arrived eight minutes into the second-half - Ben Pearson initiated a move and found Will Keane, whose powerful shot was deflected in off Leicester's Alie Sesay for 2-2.

Both teams saw chances come and go in the second period but ultimately Leicester won it in stoppage time when Barmby's deflected shot from the edge of the box deceived Amos.

United head to Chelsea next on Sunday in a re-run of last season's Premier League final.
