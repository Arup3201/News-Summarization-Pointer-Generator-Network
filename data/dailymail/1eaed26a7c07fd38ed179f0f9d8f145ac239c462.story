Spike Lee has apologised to an elderly Florida couple who say they were forced to leave their home after the director wrongly identified their address as that of  Trayvon Martin's shooter George Zimmerman.

Elaine and David McClain, who are in their 70s, say they have a son named William George Zimmerman who lived in their Sanford-area home in the mid-1990s. They say he is no relation to 28-year-old George Zimmerman who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on February 26.

The killing has touched off widespread public outrage and protests across the country, including from Lee and other celebrities, because Zimmerman was not arrested. He says he acted in self-defense.

Lee tweeted late today: 'I Deeply 
Apologize To The McClain Family For Retweeting Their Address. It Was A 
Mistake. Please Leave The McClain's In Peace.'

The school-cafeteria lunch lady, 70, 
and her 72-year-old husband had received repeated visits from reporters
and neighbours after their address was posted on Twitter.

The man and his wife, who has heart problems, had to be relocated to a hotel to avoid further trouble.

Lee had been
accused of accelerating racial tensions as he retweeted the mistaken address to his 250,000 followers.

Threatened: George Zimmerman has had a bounty placed on his head by the New Black Panthers after he shot dead an unarmed black teenager last month

Lee faced considerable 
backlash for the retweeting of the alleged whereabouts of Zimmerman, who
has an outstanding $10,000 bounty on him by the New Black Panthers. The post has since been removed from Lee's Twitter account.

The elderly couple have no relation to George Zimmerman who shot unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, 17, while on neighbourhood watch patrol in a Florida gated community last month.

Zimmerman was never arrested after claiming to have killed the teenager in self-defense. The case has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations.

The couple's son William Zimmerman told the Orlando Sentinel: 'It's scary because there are people who aren't mentally right and will take this information and run with it.'

According to the Sentinel, Mr Zimmerman traced the messages to California and asked the Twitter user to take down his parents' address - but his request was brusquely denied.

Social media surrounding the Trayvon Martin case has reached a point of near-hysteria – including a fake Will Smith tweet to be reposted thousands of times.

The alleged tweet read: ‘WE live in America where a girl that threw flour on Kim Kardashian was arrested on site. But the man who KILLED Trayvon Martin is still free.’

The fake Will Smith account, 
@RealWillSmith, in fact belonged to a man from Nashville, 
Tennessee, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

Though
the actor Will Smith does not have a publicly-identified Twitter 
account, several celebrities jumped on the re-tweeting bandwagon, 
including Rosie O’Donnell, Spike Lee and reality show star Omarosa.

The flour bombing incident to which the 
fake Smith was referring was at the London West Hollywood Hotel last 
week. Kardashian was plastered with flour while promoting her new 
fragrance, True Reflection.

Comedian and actor Will Ferrell has also been dragged into the confusion. A person with the Twitter handle @RealWillFerrell posted about a T-shirt fundraiser.

The
tweet read: ‘RIP Trayvon Martin… For every R-T this tweet gets, $1 will
be donated to the #TrayvonMartin Foundation, which helps counteract 
racism.’

However, there was yet no Trayvon Martin Foundation. Furthermore, Ferrell’s rep 
confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter that the tweet was a hoax.

Lee’s rep was unavailable for comment.
