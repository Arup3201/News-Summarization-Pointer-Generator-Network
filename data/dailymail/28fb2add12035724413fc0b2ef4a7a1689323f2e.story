A father has been jailed for sending his daughter naked pictures of himself and asking her to perform oral sex on him.

The Army serviceman seduced his child, who he had had no contact with until 2008, when she found him on Facebook and contacted him in an attempt to revive their relationship.

They then lost touch when the parent began a new relationship, which ended in 2012, Truro Crown Court heard.

It was then that the pervert, who cannot be named for legal reasons, started texting his child - but his messages became sinister.

He began sending her nude pictures of himself and telling her to respond with naked images of herself.

The youngster, frightened of being rejected, did as she was asked, before meeting up with her father.

On two occasions he sexually touched her when they were alone in a car and then asked her to perform oral sex on him, which she did.

Police were called when the man's ex-girlfriend discovered messages the pair had exchanged.

Rupert Taylor, defending, said his client was suffering from combat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), The Cornish Guardian reported.

But Judge Christopher Harvey Clark, QC, said to have sexual relations with a child family member was a 'very unusual' expression of the condition.

In sentencing he said the defendant had manipulated and betrayed his daughter, the Cornish Guardian said.

On Friday the man was sentenced to 30 months after last month admitting to four counts of sexual activity with a child family member.

The NHS identifies Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as 'an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events'.

It can develop immediately after someone experiences a disturbing event or it can occur belatedly, sometimes taking years to manifest itself.

PTSD affects up to 30 per cent of people who experience a traumatic event.

It affects around 5 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women at some point during their life.
