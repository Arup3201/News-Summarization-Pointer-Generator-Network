Missionary: Maud Kells, 75, from Cookstown, County Tyrone, who was shot twice by gunmen as they raided her home in north-east Congo 

A British missionary who received an OBE in the New Year Honours List was shot twice by bandits who raided her home in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Gunmen shot Maud Kells, 75, in the shoulder during an armed robbery at her home in Mulita in the north east of the country.

A spokesman for her Christian aid organisation, WEC International, said: 'She was stable last night, speaking, recognising people, drinking water.

'She has no broken bones, no major muscles hit and her bleeding has stopped.' 

Ms Kells, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, has worked in the Congo since 1968, initially as a missionary nurse, and has helped train  Congolese nurses in five hospitals and 30 health centres.

She also conducts bible school teaching, speaks at church services, and supervises construction projects. 

She was awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Year Honours List for a lifetime's work at the medical centre in the Congo.

Although she has previously lived in the Congo for stretches of up to four years at a time, she now spends part of the year there and the other part at home in Cookstown.

Politicians in Northern Ireland said they were shocked to hear about the shooting.

Ulster Unionist Assembly Member for Mid-Ulster Sandra Overend said: 'Only a few days ago we heard the news that Maud is to be awarded a great honour from Her Majesty the Queen and now today, this terrible news that she has been shot doing her work in the Congo is shocking.

'I am sure that I share this sadness with so many people from Cookstown and across Mid-Ulster.

'Those that know Maud will hope that her usual determination will provide her with strength to recover from this terrible incident.'

Ian McCrea, a Democratic Unionist Party Assembly Member for Mid Ulster, said: 'My thoughts and prayers are with Maud Kells tonight as she recovers from being shot twice in the shoulder.'

Pious: Ms Kells has worked in Congo since 1968, initially as a missionary nurse, latterly training Congolese nurses. She also teaches in bible school, speaks at church services, and supervises building projects

The WEC International spokesman said a primary school had been named after Ms Kells where she works. She is also a well-respected member of Molesworth Presbyterian Church in Cookstown.

He said doctors in the Congo were assessing her condition last night and considering whether to send her to Kampala for further treatment.

WEC director in Ireland Norman Cuthbert said the news about Ms Kells was very good, given that she could have been more seriously injured.

'Maud is a very, very strong lady. She has a very strong faith, I am sure Maud will recover, although it has been a very frightening experience for her.'
