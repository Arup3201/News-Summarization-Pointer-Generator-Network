It was a TV show known for its legions of dedicated fans.

And now it seems Star Trek obsessives are about to go one step further than ever before after a call to arms from their heroes.

The northern Californian scientific research organisation, the SETI Institute, has been asking members of the public to come up with new names for two of Pluto's moons.

Call to arms:  Leonard Nimoy, left, and William Shatner, right, have been urging fans of Star Trek to vote Vulcan as the new name of one of Pluto's moons

The names will then be passed to the International Astronomical Union which will make the final call.

And its looking increasingly likely that one of the names will be Vulcan - which is known to Star Trek fans as the home planet of Spock - the loyal member of the Starship Enterprise.

Star Trek fans have been urged to vote for the new name by none other than Captain Kirk and Mr Spock.

Leonard Nimoy - who played Spock - said it was 'logical' that one of the moons should be named Vulcan.

But his former captain, Kirk, played by William Shatner - even urged Trekkies to write to the SETI Institute to recommend the name.

Writing on his Facebook page earlier this month, Mr Shatner showed his delight that the name was added as an option. He said: 'It apparently made a difference as they now have added it as an official name.

'Isn’t that wonderful.'

Following the public appeals by two of the show's iconic stars, the name was added as one of the 21 options. And it quickly rocketed to the top of the tally.

By Friday afternoon, it had about 140,000 votes, which was way ahead of its next two closest alternatives called Cerberus and Styx which both had about 80,000 votes each.

The voting finished at noon today. The International Astronomical Union will make the final call.

The SETI Institute will propose the top two names from the list.

The two moons which will be named are currently known as P4 and P5. The two orbiting spheres were only discovered in 2011 and 2012 following images from the Hubble Space Telescope.
