Gary Dawn, who is also known as Pogo the Clown, who is accused of viciously attacking a police officer with a bottle of vodka 

A professional clown who was accused of viciously attacking a police officer with a bottle of vodka has walked free from court after being found not guilty.

Gary Dawn, who is also known as Pogo the Clown, was accused of maliciously wounding PC Mark Szeremetta leaving him hospitalised with a gaping wound to his skull.

But today a jury at Nottingham Crown Court found the 54-year-old not guilty of the offence.

The court had heard how the 54-year-old had been drinking on February 12 after the break-up of his long term relationship, which had left him feeling depressed.

But when a friend called police over concerns for his welfare, Dawn lashed out when the officer arrived at the scene in Stoke Bardolph near Gedling in Nottinghamshire.

The court heard how PC Szeremetta approached the accused before he launched the bottle of vodka he was drinking in the officer's face.

The officer was then taken to hospital with a head injury and needing the wound glued, jurors were told.

Prosecutor Mark Knowles told the court Dawn's actions were 'reckless' and that he intended to do harm.

He said: 'It's a straight forward issue. He pushed the officer away and the Crown will say that's indicative of the defendant's mood.

'He had no regard for others.'

Giving evidence, PC Szeremetta, who was first on the scene on Stoke Lane said: 'I got out of the police vehicle and went to approach the male.

'He had his back to me at that stage.'

PC Szeremetta said after shouting after Dawn he then approached the defendant when he was struck by the bottle.

He added: 'I was very shocked, I was blinded, I could not really see at the time what I had been struck with.

Dawn denied the charge at Nottingham Crown Court, pictured, and the trial continues 

'My priority was the preservation of the male.'

Jurors were told the police officer caught up with Dawn - who has previously made attempts at taking his own life - and sat on him until other officers arrived.

Dawn, who has been a professional clown for 20 years and done charity work with When You Wish Upon A Star, told the court: 'I was not thinking of the consequences.

'I was just down, looking down.

'There was someone behind me and I got frightened and scared.'

Dawn denied the charge claiming it wasn’t intentional and he was just trying to push the officer away without realising the bottle was in his hand.

He added he only realised the hand he struck the officer with had a bottle in it was when his 'hand felt lighter'.
