Hapless robber Paul Easby who failed to hold up a bank then arrived to rob a shop in a taxi, left his fingerprints on the door and forgot to put his balaclava on

A forgetful armed raider ordered a taxi to take him between robberies - only to then take off his balaclava as he walked past CCTV.

Paul Easby had tried to hold up a bank minutes before he went into a corner shop to rob the staff at knifepoint in Plymouth, Devon. 

But while Easby, 37, managed to put on a balaclava  in the shop – just seconds earlier he had walked up and down the shop's aisles unmasked past several CCTV cameras.

He then removed the mask as he left the shop - again in full view of cameras.

The hapless raider even requested that the black cab waited outside the Londis shop in Plymouth, Devon, as he went inside armed with a knife.

Easby brandished a knife and grabbed cash but fled when the store worker pushed the panic button.

He jumped in the taxi , while the unsuspecting driver drove off - only for police to stop and arrest Easby, of Plymouth, Devon, minutes later.

Easby pleaded guilty to attempting to rob a bank cashier and attempting to rob the Londis shop 1.3 miles away minutes later.

He was jailed for ten years at Plymouth Crown Court.

Prosecutor Paul Grumbar said Easby loitered in the Barclays branch for several minutes just after 10am.

He said Easby handed the cashier a note which said: 'Give me the money or I will shoot you'.

But Mr Grumbar said the woman refused, pressed an alarm and snatched the note away - which was later found to carry Easby's fingerprints.

Paul Easby had tried to hold up a bank minutes before he went into the Londis corner shop to rob the staff at knifepoint in Plymouth, Devon. He can be seen walking into the shop without his mask on

In full view of CCTV, he walks up and down shop aisles, and makes his way to the back of the store in Plymouth

He said: 'Easby caught a taxi nearby straight to the Londis store. The cab stayed outside while Easby threatened [a worker] who was working alone in the store.

'He pointed the knife at the worker and said: 'Give me the money, I am not afraid to use it'.

The court Easby left the bank empty handed then hailed a cab and went to the shop and asked the driver to wait outside.

Easby was captured walking unmasked up and down the aisles on July 10 before going to a private part of the store and putting on his balaclava.

He even walked past the shop assistant several times as he was crouched on the floor, stacking shelves 

Thinking he has found the perfect spot, he head to the store room to put on his balaclava - seemingly unaware that he has been filmed the entire time

He then approached the cashier with a knife and forced him to open the till and leaned over and helped himself to cash.

Easby then took off his balaclava just as he walked out the store before getting back into the back of the same taxi and was driven away. 

He changed his plea on the day of his trial only about a week after seeing the CCTV for the first time with a solicitor.

Judge Simon Carr praised the 'considerable bravery' shown by the woman who ignored Easby's threat that he had a gun to press a panic alarm at the Barclays branch.

He said: 'The bank cashier took four months before she could return to work and even when she did she was having nightmares.'

He then approached the cashier with a knife and forced him to open the till - as the assistant pushed the panic button to alert police

Still wearing his balaclava, Easby leaned over and helped himself to cash 

But he then took off his balaclava just as he walked out of the store - again in full view of CCTV cameras

He then got back into the waiting cab - whose oblivious driver pulled away and drove off only for police to stop and arrest Easby, of Plymouth, Devon, minutes later

Easby, a father-of-two from Plymouth, has been a heroin addict since his early 20s and carried out the raid while high on a cocktail of drugs.

The court heard Easby had committed a string of armed robberies back in 2004, when he escaped with cash and jewellery worth £80,000 from shops in Plymouth.

He turned cat burglar to break into an antiques shop in September 2010 when he shinned up a drainpipe and balanced on a model shark to get inside.

After the case, DC Glenn Harrop said: 'These are serious offences and we are happy with the outcome. It is just good that nobody was hurt. Easby has reached the end of the road.'
