A man who arrived at Heathrow with a teenage boy was sent back to the US following concerns that he planned to sexually exploit the youngster to tourists during the Olympic Games.

Jason Daniel Gandy, 35, arrived at the airport with the 15-year-old boy last Thursday but was immediately stopped by suspicious immigration guards.

Following questioning, officials received conflicting statements from the boy, his mother and Gandy and the pair were sent back to the U.S. on separate planes.

Gandy, a licensed massage therapist, was quizzed in his home city of 
Houston and now faces charges of a criminal complaint for transportation
 of a minor for a commercial sex act.

According to The Baytown Sun, a court heard that Gandy intended to perform massages in London to take advantage of international travellers seeking a 'good time'.

Detectives heard the boy had previously performed massages in the nude and masturbated Gandy's clients in Houston.

The case follows previous concerns from a number of children's charities about child exploitation during the Olympics.

During questioning by detectives in Houston, Gandy told agents that he met the teenager through a mutual friend on Facebook. He said he was aware of how old he was.

According to court documents, the boy would spend the night with Gandy at least once a week.

He also gave him massages during which Gandy would masturbate in the youngster's presence.

According to chron.com, the two also masturbated in front of each other on a number of occasions.

Gandy runs his own massage parlor from his home and the boy told detectives that he was often asked to help Gandy with massaging his clients - sometimes in the nude.

The boy said he was asked to masturbate the clients and they were also allowed to 'fondle' him.

Gandy was refused bail and is now being held in jail.

Barnardo's previously warned that whenever there is a major event such as the Games, child sexual exploitation can occur.

Speaking to The Northern Echo, Anne Marie Carrie, Barnardoâ€™s chief 
executive, said: 'We know from the work we do on the ground with children that 
the risk of boys and girls being trafficked and sexually exploited 
during major events is a very real threat.'
