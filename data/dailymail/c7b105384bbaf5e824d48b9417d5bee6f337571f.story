Dolly Parton works from Nine to Five - but she might have to find time to be a pet owner too after she offered to adopt a dog left behind at Glastonbury.

The country legend said she would take in the white lurcher if her owner is not found.

The canine was discovered in a tent during a clean-up after thousands of festival-goers left the site.She was named Dolly after the star, who stole the show with her first ever performance at the event a week ago.

Abandoned: The white lurcher was found in one of the 5,000 tents that were left discarded in the fields of Worthy Farm, Somerset after the festival. A crew of up to 800 were responsible for tidying up the camp site

A hit: Dolly Parton may be taking an unlikely fan home with her from her trip to the UK in the form of Dolly the dog who was left behind

Discarded: Dolly was found in a tent on Tuesday as the cleaning crew began transforming the site back to a working dairy farm. The process, which involves litter pickers, tractors and volunteers, could take six weeks

The dog was taken in by the Happy Landings animal shelter, which is close to the Glastonbury venue at Worthy Farm in Somerset.

Parton,
 68, said: “I had my manager call the Happy Landings animal shelter to 
make sure the dog is being treated and cared for properly.

'At
 this time, nobody has claimed the dog and the dog is in great hands at 
the shelter. I will take the dog home to America if nobody claims her 
within a reasonable amount of time.'

She also sent a video message saying she is 'very honored and flattered' that the dog had been named after her.

Ain't she cute? Dolly Parton tweeted about dog Dolly, saying she'll take her home if no one claims her

It is not the first time the singer has had an animal named in her honor.

After
 Dolly the Sheep became the world’s first successfully cloned mammal, 
doctors revealed she was so-named because she was derived from a mammary
 gland cell - and they said they could not think of a more impressive 
pair of glands than Parton’s.

In
 a message on its website, Happy Landings said Dolly the dog is a 'sweet-natured older lady' who arrived with a 'serious ear infection.'

The shelter said it had received many phone calls from concerned members of the public after the dog’s plight emerged.

Appeal: Rescue workers said that they had hoped Dolly's owners would have come forward, but there has been no information so far

Namesake: The lonely dog was renamed Dolly after Glastonbury hit Dolly Parton who performed on the Pyramid stage on day three of the festival. Some 80,000 revellers crowded around  to watch the 68-year-old singer

Recovery: Dolly, pictured with a rescue worker, is now being looked after at Happy Landings animal shelter. A spokesperson from Glastonbury declined to comment but said that pets were not welcome at the festival

Animal rescue workers are seeking the owner of this dog - which was found abandoned in a tent at Glastonbury Festival.

The
 lurcher was found cowering in one of the 5,000 discarded tents during 
the clean-up of the 1200-acre festival site at Worthy Farm, Somerset.

The beautiful white dog was renamed 'Dolly' by officials in tribute to festival hit Dolly Parton.

Over five days last, the site it was home 
to some 175,000 people, who attended performances by world-class acts 
such as Metallica, Arcade Fire and Kasabian.

And some 80,000 revellers crowded around the 
stage to watch Dolly the dog's country music singing namesake bring the festival to a 
close on its third day of music.
