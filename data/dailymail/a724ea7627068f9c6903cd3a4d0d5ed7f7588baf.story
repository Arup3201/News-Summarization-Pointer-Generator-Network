A four-year-old boy who is dying from a rare disease has written a heartbreaking letter describing his illness as his mother hit out at scientists for their lack of research into a cure for the condition.

Marshall Starhahn is just one of 24 children in the UK to suffer from Late Infantile Batten Disease, a disorder of the nervous system which normally proves fatal by the age of 12.

His mother Lisa, 23, has published a letter written by her son with the help of her and his grandmother in the hope that it may persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in finding a cure for the illness.

Heartbreaking: Marshall Starhahn, pictured with his mother Lara, suffers from a rare and fatal genetic disorder

Upset: Ms Starhahn spoke out about her son's condition in the hope that pharmaceutical companies might try and find a cure for the disease

Tragic: Four-year-old Marshall's condition means that he is unlikely to live beyond the age of 12. He is pictured with one of his school teachers

She said: 'There is no cure, not even a treatment.

'It's basically too rare and not profitable enough for the people who research medications to look into it because there are not enough children like Marshall in the world to make it worthwhile for them financially.

'Marshall will eventually go blind. He will lose the ability to walk completely soon. He's not able to feed himself any more. He can't eat lumps so he will have to be tube fed eventually.

'Children with Batten Disease become bed ridden and then die without being able to see or communicate.

Deterioration: Marshall, pictured with his father Michael, was a normal little boy before his diagnosis back in April

Fundraisers: Marshall with his mother Lara and grandmother Elsie Clark holding up signs saying thank you to some of those who helped pay for a recent trip to Disneyland with his family

'I have to live every day knowing that my child is going to die and all I can do is watch, there is nothing I can physically do.

She added: 'As a parent you want nothing more than to protect your children from everything you can and that chance has completely been taken away from me.

'There are no realistic clinical trials that I can put him on, no doctors that can put him on medication that he hasn't already tried.'

Marshall was diagnosed with the disorder in April following several months of seizures, thought to be epilepsy, which got progressively worse.

Thank you: Marshall, pictured, wrote a letter of thank you to those who raised funds for him to go to Disneyland, describing his terrible condition

He now also suffers from night terrors, jerks which make him constantly fall over, tremors which mean he can't feed himself or play with his toys, and absences where his eyes roll back in his head and he becomes vacant.

The youngster wanted to write the thank you note after friends and colleagues of Marshall's grandmother Elsie Clark, a staff nurse at St Luke's Hospice, in Plymouth, and grandfather Nobbie Clark, a black-cab driver, collected over Â£1,000 upon hearing of his diagnosis.

The money went towards sending Marshall to Disneyland, Paris, with his family.

A local newsagents also raised money while the Army Benevolent Charity and Royal Artillery Charitable Fund donated money towards the cost of the trip as Marshall's dad Michael is serving with the Army.

Rare: The youngster is one of just 24 in the UK diagnosed with the condition

Lara said of her decision to publish the thank you note: 'I want people to know that there is a childhood disease that hasn't got a cure and that every childhood disease should have a cure.

'It shouldn't matter how many children suffer from it, there should at least be some sort of treatment for those children to give them a chance.

'It makes me angry that companies that make billions of pounds through other diseases can't even find it in their hearts to at least try to invest into Batten disease.

'These children deserve to have a happy childhood. Even if I can't save my own child I will do all I can to raise enough awareness to save someone else's child, to save someone else's family going through what my family is going through.

'Having to think about your child's funeral before they are five years old is horrible, but it's the reality - there is nothing in the world that can save him.

Marshall Starhahn's letter

'My name is Marshall and I am four-and-a-half years old. Until 12 months I ago I was a normal little boy.

'I loved playing football and going down the slide in the park and paddling in the sea. I was always laughing and loving. Well, I still am very loving!

'Then I started having fits, lots of different types. And I began to have trouble talking and things I could do before I couldn't do anymore.

'The doctor did lots of tests and told my mummy and nana in April that that I have Late Infantile NCL, a form of Batten disease.

'It makes me very special because there are only about 20 to 30 children like me in Britain.

Lots of horrible things are happening to me very quickly now.

'My hands shake so much I can't play with my toys very well and I have to be fed. And I lose my balance all the time so I can only walk a little bit and need to be steadied when I do.

'I fall over all the time and I get covered in bruises but I rarely cry.

'And there are lots of things I can't eat any more because I choke and I can hardly talk anymore.

'It cost so much money but I had everything I wanted and more because my nana's friends at St Luke's Hospice had a collection for me and my granddad's work friends (he has been a taxi driver for about a hundred years) also collected lots of money for me.

'So I just wanted to say a really big thank you to the staff of St Luke's Hospice and the taxi drivers and Raz at Tremaine newsagents and send you all a big hug.

'Love from Marshall xxx'
