A father has been left outraged after his ten-month-old baby's grandfather doused her in freezing water as part of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

Reggie Stiller posted a video online as part of the viral charity stunt where he doused himself - and his 10-month-old granddaughter Aria - with the freezing torrent.

The baby's father, Claude Dalcour, from Houston, who is in the midst of a divorce from the child's mother, said he was disgusted by his former father-in-law's actions and that he should know better.

Grandfather Reggie Stiller doused himself and his ten-month-old grand-daughter Aria as part of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, much to the outrage of the child's father  

The little girl was drenched by the freezing water in the clip which was posted on Facebook. One stranger reportedly sent the link to the video to child services

Father Claude Dalcour told WTSP: 'I was shocked. Everybody I know was pretty much shocked and appalled.'  

Mr Dalcour said he contacted the police, adding: 'It's not his child, it's my child.'

The grandfather does not appear to have been charged with any crime. Mr Stiller had today deleted his social media pages.

The video has been shared on Facebook more than 20,000 times and led one stranger who viewed it to contact family services. It is not clear whether the agency will investigate. 

One outraged viewer Monique Nicole wrote: 'The fact that he just dumped ice cold water on the baby which could traumatize, cause shock or result in aspiration of water might be a factor of danger...'

Another wrote LaTanya Haynes posted: 'I don't like my grandchildren to even cry!.....Shame on you B******!'
