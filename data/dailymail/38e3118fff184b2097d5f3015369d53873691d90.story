A retired RAF officer died virtually penniless after his  family was forced to sell his home to pay for his dementia care.

Wing Commander Geoff Beckett had served his country all his life. But when his health deteriorated, his bravery counted for nothing –  because he owned his house.

Under rules which punish thousands of responsible pensioners every year,  he was told the £160,000 property  would have to be sold to pay for the care he needed.

Over nearly six years, the widower's 
carefully-accrued savings – money he would have hoped to pass to his 
three grandchildren – were almost completely used up.

Finally, last month, his family 
managed to persuade the authorities that he was so ill he was entitled 
to state help. By a terrible irony, Mr Beckett died a week later, at the
age of 88 and with virtually all his money gone.

Yesterday his family backed calls for a
reformed care system which does not penalise responsible pensioners who
have saved for their retirement.

'I can't believe how my dad was 
treated,' his daughter Gill Bradley, 54, said yesterday. 'He lost his 
house and his savings to pay for his care and it's not right. He'd 
worked hard all his life for his savings and served his country, but the
reality is there are a lot of people just like my dad who are having to
sell off their homes to pay for care.

'They said that he didn't qualify 
because he had his RAF pension, savings and a house that he sold to pay 
for his care. It's the system  that is at fault.

'My dad served his country but his country failed to serve him.'

Mr Beckett was a member of the Home 
Guard before he joined the RAF.

During a colourful career he served in 
Palestine in the 1950s, was involved in rocket tests in Australia and 
interviewed Cold War prisoners in Berlin's Spandau Prison. At one point,
he was even wanted as a spy by the Russians.

He was an aircraft engineer in Oman in
the 1970s before he retired to North Wales with his wife, Joan, where 
he played golf and enjoyed building and fixing clocks.

Mrs Beckett died aged 79 in 2002, and 
four years later Mr Beckett started showing signs of dementia.

His 
family were told he would have to move to a care home – but officials at
the Betsi Cadwaladr University health board said he did not qualify for
state help.

As he had more than £23,000 in 
savings, no support was available until the money ran out. As a result, 
his family had to sell his five-bedroom house in Penmaenmawr to pay fees
of up to £2,800 a month. Over the next six years, nearly all of his 
savings were swallowed up.

The family repeatedly argued that his 
health needs meant the bills ought to be subsidised – and finally on 
September 3 the health board agreed to healthcare payments. He died just
a week later.

'He definitely warranted help from the Government,' said his daughter, a dental nurse.

'He was such an amazing person and had
such an incredible career. I'm glad he was in a good home where he was 
treated with such respect, dignity and love.

'It's a shame that he didn't get the same treatment from the Government.'

Last year economist Andrew Dilnot, who
was hired by the Coalition to draw up a new funding system, suggested 
the amount pensioners have to pay for their care should be capped at 
£35,000.

However it later emerged any change in
the law could see a cap placed at £100,000 rendering the plan 
'meaningless', according to critics.

Mrs Bradley added: 'My dad had an 
amazing life - he went rocket testing in Australia and during the cold 
war he was interviewing prisoners at Spandau Prison and worked with the 
British secret service.

'He
was a bit of a James Bond - the Russians wanted him at one time and put
out his picture to say that he wasn’t allowed in their country. I’m not
sure how true that is but it’s what my dad used to tell us.'

'James Bond': He served with the Home Guard with his father during World War Two before he was commissioned to the RAF where he rose to become a wing commander

In
October 2006 Mrs Bradley said she got a phone call from a local British
Gas man. The water tank had flooded my dad’s house so he’d called them 
out.

'However the gas man 
rang me because he was concerned that my dad had appeared confused. I 
was really worried so took him to the doctors who did tests on him and 
he was diagnosed with vascular dementia.

'I
used to see him on a regular basis but I must have missed little signs 
because I saw him so often so it was harder to notice things, plus he 
had hidden quite a lot from us for ages. I do wish I saw the signs 
earlier.'

After his diagnosis, Mrs Bradley was told that her father 
would have to move to a care home for his own safety.

But officials at 
Betsi Cadwaladr University Local Health Board said he did not qualify 
for health care payments as he had more than £23,000 of savings.

She said: The government will not fund anyone with more than that and dad had a five bedroom house and an RAF pension.

'Altogether it was about £160,000 of his savings that he had to use - including selling his house - over six years.

'He
didn’t know what was really going on. I know that there was nothing 
that we could do about it because someone had to take care of him.

'When he was assessed I was told that he had quite a few severe needs and qualified for help. But they then moved him to another home that they said met his needs better rather than funding him. They kept moving the goal posts.

'He was in a wheelchair and he was double incontinent and had sepsis - how poorly do you need to be to get help?'

The Board finally agreed to pay for Mr Beckett’s care from September 3 but he died just a week later on September 10.

Mr Beckett’s family are now battling to claim some of his money.

His daughter added: '10 days before he died we finally got the confirmation that he would have his care paid for - but it was too late and he died on 10.

'I
was told to cancel his direct debit - but it was too little, too late. 
He definitely warranted help from the government. Some people are left 
with nothing after they die because they have been made to spend all 
their life savings on their own care and it’s not right.'

'He was such an amazing person and had such an incredible career in the RAF. This is why I was so upset and angry at the way he was treated.

'It’s too late for my family but I hope this helps other families to safe guard their inheritance.

‘We all want to help out children and grandchildren and pass money down the line but there is little to show for what an amazing life my dad had.

'Of course I’m glad he was in a good home where he was treated with such respect, dignity and love. It’s a shame that he didn’t get the same treatment from the government.'

A spokesman for the Betsi Cadwaladr board said: 'People are eligible for NHS healthcare funding if their main care requirements are to address health needs.

'This need is determined by an assessment carried out by a range of NHS staff, colleagues from local authorities and other professionals involved in a patient’s care, according to a national framework.

'This framework considers the nature and intensity of a person’s needs, how different needs interact with each other and whether the needs fluctuate over time.'

Earlier this year David Cameron pledged to end the heartache of tens of thousands of elderly people who are forced to sell their homes to fund long-term care.

He said he wanted to implement recommendations that cap the amount individuals pay at £35,000 - with the taxpayer picking up any further bills.
