Together: Rebuck and Frye were spending Christmas together at the time of the alleged crime

Detectives say he then slipped some of the substance into a drink for her - but she refused it because of its odd smell, Fox59 reported.

According to WISH-TV, Frye then looked through his cell phone and found attempts to research miscarriage-inducing chemicals in his search history.

She called police who arrested Rebuck and charged him with attempted feticide - the crime of trying to kill an unborn child. Detectives say he admitted to them that he was trying to kill the baby.

Clary sage oil is claimed to help with menstrual cramps or other forms of stress. But the substance is often accompanied with warnings against use in pregnancy.

Rebuck appeared before a judge in Madison County, who set his bail at $20,000 and gave prosecutors until December 31 to formalize charges.
