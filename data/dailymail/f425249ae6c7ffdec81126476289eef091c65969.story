Sir John Major said 'no one should weep' for Labour if the party loses 40 MPs in the next election

Former Prime Minister John Major today blamed Labour for the growing threat of Scottish independence – claiming the party had spent years attacking the Conservatives and Westminster.

Sir John said Labour and the SNP ‘have fed a divisive narrative that has bitten deep, ignoring the revolution in Scottish living standards brought about, in large part, by Conservative policies’.

He added: ‘It would be ironic indeed if Scotland voted for separation, and Labour lost all its significant representation in the House of Commons. If this comes to pass, no one should weep for them.’ 

Sir John's remarks, in an article in the Times newspaper today, come amid growing panic among senior Labour figures over the prospect of independence. 

The party would lose more than 40 MPs, potentially depriving it of the chance of a Commons majority after the next election.

But a vote for Scottish independence would be ‘disastrous’ for the whole of the United Kingdom and not just Labour, Sir John said.

In a second impassioned plea to Scots, in an interview on the BBC this morning, he said Britain would be 'diminished' on the world stage.

He told Radio 4's Today programme that the United Kingdom was ‘the most successful union’ in history but would be badly damaged without Scotland.

He said: ‘I am desperately concerned at what is happening. We would be immensely weaker as a nation in every respect - morally, politically, in every material aspect - if Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom were to part company.

‘This year is the 100th anniversary of the First World War. As we honour the people who fought together then, would it not be extraordinary if the SNP broke up the most successful union and partnership in all history in any part of the world?’

Sir John said that young Scots considering casting a vote for independence in next week's referendum would find themselves living in ‘a very different country’ over the coming decades if there was a Yes vote.

‘There is easy assumption that Scotland will be waved into the European Union. Well, maybe after a period of years that's possible but it's not certain. Spain for example wouldn't welcome a separatist nation,’ he said.

‘There is the belief they are going to be able to get into Nato. Why would Nato let them in when the SNP propose to wreck the Trident independent nuclear weapon?

‘If Britain lost Trident it would have lost what has shielded it and protected it for a long time - including Scotland. 

'For that to be done by the enemy would be a disaster, to have it done by friends is almost unbelievable.’

Sir John said that the lose of the Trident nuclear deterrent - which is currently based in Scotland - would have consequences for the whole of the UK.

‘Our role in Nato would be reduced, our relations consequently with the United States would be damaged,’ he said

‘The United Kingdom would be weaker in every international body it attends. We would lose our seat at the top table in the United Nations.’

The former premier - who warned 20 years ago that Scottish devolution would be ‘the high road to separation’ - was scathing about the SNP's inability to say what currency they would use if they did achieve independence.

‘It is one week away from the vote and people of Scotland do not know what currency they will have - I've never known such incompetence,’ he said.
