Bacon cocktail? Anyone?

Bacon: great in a sandwich, lovely wrapped around chicken, fabulous with eggs.

But in a drink? Surely not.

Surely yes, at Anatomical Cocktails, London's most doolally pop-up cocktail bar.

This October in the bar's stall at the St Bartholomew's Pathology Museum, you will be able to sample a Charred Remains - the Bloody Mary with the cheeky porky streak.

Combined with vodka, Jack Daniels, tabasco, Worcester sauce, black food colouring, paprika, pepper and lemon, the Charred Remains is one drink on a menu created by madcap mixologist James Dance.

Dance - who runs the Loading gaming bar in Falmouth, Cornwall - will be whipping up rounds of the drink alongside other macabre whistle-wetters all inspired by death and destruction.

Besides the Charred Remains you will find gorily delectable beverages including the Stomach Contents (flavoured vodka, bits of chocolate and Skittles), the Fat (Kahlua, caramel rum, hazelnut syrup and white rum topped with hard white chocolate), the Sanitiser (lychee liqueur, cherry brandy, grenadine, vodka and white rum), the test tube of Urine (whiskey, brandy and limoncello) and the Stool Sample (a mixture of cocoa, coffee liqueur, vodka, and cream liqueurs, strawberry syrup and fudge pieces, all served inside a plastic bag).

Speaking to Emerald Street, Dance said: 'These cocktails are creative – it's good fun to make them and I like having a side line to running the bar.

'Yes, they're supposed to be show stopping but they also taste good. Although I don't put them on our bar menu!'

The drinks have been created as part of 'the world's first anatomically correct cake shop' food stall set inside the pathology museum, part of a space run by Eat Your Heart Out, the world's most gruesome cake company, where 'toenail cupcakes' are the norm.

See below for the Charred Remains recipe - plus an extra one for Nigella Lawson's salty-sweet bacon brownies, also featured on Emerald Street.

Anatomical Cocktails will be at the Eat Your Heart Out space at St Bartholomew's Pathology Museum, 3rd Floor Robin Brook Centre, London, EC1M 6BQ, from 26 to 28 October.

The Stomach Contents and the Sanitiser may look revolting but we have been promised they are nothing but sweetness and light

The Urine and the Fat are, at first sight, not for the faint of heart

Bacon is infinitely better than a straw

Pour the granulated sugar and salt into a sandwich bag, add a drop of black food colouring and shake until dyed black.

Run a lemon wedge around the rim of a high ball glass. Take the black sugar and salt mixture, pour out into a saucer and dip the moistened end of the glass in it.

Add ice cubes to the glass and pour in the tomato juice along with the pepper, paprika, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce.

Add the Jack Daniels and the vodka. (Tip: pour over the back of spoon to help the spirits layer on top of the juice.)

Bunch together your crispy bacon and place on the top of the glass to finish.

 

Would you put bacon in your brownies?

NIGELLA LAWSON'S BACON BROWNIES
Makes 16 squares

Preheat the oven to 190°C and get out a 25cm square tin and line it, or
(as I prefer) a throwaway foil baking tray measuring 30cm x 20cm x 
15cm.

Heat a heavy based (preferably non stick) frying pan and
when warm, add the bacon bits and cook, stirring occasionally until 
beginning to crisp. Add the syrup, stir again to mix and transfer the 
sticky bacon bits to a cold surface, either on some foil or a plate. The
syrupy bacon juices left behind are just delicious when mopped up with 
some bread: a cook’s treat.

Melt the butter over a gentle heat
in a medium sized saucepan and when it’s melted, add the sugar, 
stirring with a wooden spoon.

Now take the pan off the heat 
and add the cocoa, flour, bicarbonate of soda and stir, then add the 
beaten eggs and stir again to mix.

Add the chopped dark choc 
or chips and the bacon bits, breaking them up with your hands if 
necessary. Fold together then pour and scrape into the tin.

Place in the oven to cook for 20-25 minutes; you want a little gooeyness inside still.

Transfer the tin to a wire rack and sit until cooled a little (but not to the point of coldness) and cut into 16 squares.
