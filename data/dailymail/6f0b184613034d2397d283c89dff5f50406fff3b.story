Warrington’s Matty Russell is in good spirits after the full back was cleared of any serious injury following a horrifying collision in the Wolves' play-off win on Saturday.

Russell has had two front teeth removed and is sporting a monstrous fat lip, as he showed in a post on Twitter, after the sickening collision with Vikings prop Macgraff Leuluai.

But it could have been so much worse for the 21-year-old Scotland international, who joined the Wolves this season after stints at Wigan, Hull and the Gold Coast Titans in the NRL.

A scan later cleared him fears his skull or jaw had been fractured.

'Check that out.. That's what u call a fat lip haha,' Russell posted on Twitter. 

Russell received a torrent of support after the incident, and thanked them on the social networking site. 'Like to again thank everyone for the messages from our fans and other clubs .. Back home now and hopefully be back soon,' he said.
