CNN is reportedly being sued following a biting incident involving one of its Emmy award-winning reporters at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq last month.

Arwa Damon, 36, a Beirut-based correspondent, is accustomed to sinking her teeth into juicy stories - but this time, she allegedly became 'seriously intoxicated' at the embassy in Baghdad in July and bit two EMTs.

TMZ reports that Tracy Lamar and Charles Simons, EMTs working for a private contractor in Iraq, say Damon chomped into each of their left arms as they tried to help her.

According to the lawsuit obtained by TMZ, Lamar and Simons say they were trying to help the drunken journalist when she became belligerent.

The medics were called to calm the correspondent after she became 'totally out of control,' reports the New York Daily News.

She allegedly tried to deter them by attempting a 'don't you know who I am?' tactic, telling them she was a 'major reporter for CNN,' but when this failed she became physically violent.

'She was biting them both pretty furiously. She has good teeth. Eventually they subdued her,' David Jaroslawicz, an attorney for Simons and Lamar, told the Daily News.

The suit claims she bit both Lamar and Simons on their left arms. Simons says his knees and elbows were also injured, and Lamar says she sustained bruising in the attack.

The suit claims that CNN was aware Damon had a history of drunken aggression, and was even known to be violent when sober, reports TMZ.

Lamar and Simons are suing CNN for $1 million each.

Damon's biography on CNN states that she's an award-winning journalist whose recent focus has been on the situation in Syria.

She won an Emmy for Outstanding Live Coverage of a Current News Story for her reporting on the Arab Spring, as well as a Peabody Award.

Recently, she was given the Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women's Media Foundation.

She is from Boston but spent much of her childhood in Morocco and Turkey.

CNN has responded to requests for comment with a statement: 'We are not aware of the alleged lawsuit and therefore have no comment.'
