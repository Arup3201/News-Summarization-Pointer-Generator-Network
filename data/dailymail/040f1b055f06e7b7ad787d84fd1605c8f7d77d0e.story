Staffers were evacuated from the American embassy in Libya on Saturday and sent to Tunisia safely, officials said.

'All embassy personnel were relocated, including the Marine security guards who were providing security at the embassy and during the movement,' Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement Saturday.

'The embassy staff was driven in vehicles to Tunisia,' he said. 'During movement, F-16's, ISR assets and an Airborne Response Force with MV-22 Ospreys provided security.'

Kirby said that 'The mission was conducted without incident, and the entire operation lasted approximately five hours.'

The battle for control of Tripoli's international airport began two weeks ago when Islamist-led militias launched a surprise assault on the airport, under control of rival militias from the western mountain town of Zintan.  On Saturday, the U.S. evacuated its diplomats in Tripoli to neighboring Tunisia and shut its embassy

An unnamed US official told ABC News a that a destroyer - which was not mentioned in Kirby's statement - was another possible resource. 

When asked about the number of evacuees, a State Department official told MailOnline 'We do not discuss exact numbers for security reasons.'

However, ABC News reported 'there were about 150 Americans that were taken out in the convoy, with more than 80 of them being Marines,' citing its unnamed source.

Tom Saunders, a spokesman for US Africa Command, told MailOnline that 'There were two MV-22s deployed from Naval Air Station Sigonella, Italy. The MV-22s belong to the Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response (SP-MAGTAF-CR) element located at NAS Sigonella.

'The main component of the SP-MAGTAF-CR is located at Moron Air Base, Spain. A portion of the SP-MAGTF-CR matinains a [presence] at NAS Sigonella to be prepared to protect U.S. personnel and facilities on U.S. installations in north Africa.

'[One] MV-22 carried one a quick response team of approximately 24 U.S military forces personnel, and the second carried a 2-person medical team. Three Air Force F-16s from Aviano provided air support. And an Air Force KC-135 from RAF Mildenhall, the UK, provided refueling support.'

Saunders told MailOnline he was not aware of a destroyer, but said 'it’s not unusual for U.S. naval assets to be in that region during operations or training exercises.'

State Department spokesman Marie Harf said in a Saturday statement the evacuation occurred '[d]ue to the ongoing violence resulting from clashes between Libyan militias in the immediate vicinity of the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli.'

American personnel at the Tripoli 
embassy, which had already been operating with limited staffing, left 
the capital around dawn and traveled by road to neighboring Tunisia, 
according to Harf.

'We are grateful to the Government of Tunisia for its cooperation and support,' Harf said.

As the evacuation was underway, residents of the 
city reported in real time on social media that American military 
aircraft flew overhead while U.S. soldiers escorted a convoy of vehicles
 out of town. The State Department would not confirm the evacuation 
until all staffers were safely in Tunisia.

The withdrawal underscored the Obama administration's concern about the heightened risk to American diplomats abroad, particularly in Libya where memories of the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in the eastern city of Benghazi are still vivid and the political uproar over it remain fresh ahead of a new congressional investigation into the incident.

'Securing our facilities and ensuring the safety of our personnel are top department priorities, and we did not make this decision lightly,' Harf said. 'Security has to come first.  Regrettably, we had to take this step because the location of our embassy is in very close proximity to intense fighting and ongoing violence between armed Libyan factions.'

Support: MV-22 Ospreys, like the one in this file photo, were on-hand during the evacuation, the Pentagon said in a statement

The evacuation was accompanied by the release of a new State Department travel warning for Libya urging Americans not to go to the country and recommending that those already there leave immediately. 'The Libyan government has not been able to adequately build its military and police forces and improve security' it said. 'Many military-grade weapons remain in the hands of private individuals, including antiaircraft weapons that may be used against civilian aviation.'

The department said embassy operations will be suspended until a determination is made that the security situation has improved, it said. Tripoli has been embroiled for weeks in inter-militia violence that has killed and wounded dozens on all sides. The fighting has been particularly intense at the city's airport.

'We are committed to supporting the Libyan people during this challenging time, and are currently exploring options for a permanent return to Tripoli as soon as the security situation on the ground improves.  In the interim, staff will operate from Washington and other posts in the region,' Harf said. The evacuated staffers will continue to work on Libya issues in Tunis, elsewhere in North Africa and Washington.

The move marks the second time in a little more than three years that Washington has closed its embassy in Libya. In Feb. 2011, the embassy suspended operations amid the uprising that eventually toppled longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. After the formation of a transitional government in July, 2011, the embassy reopened in September. Gadhafi was killed in October of 2011.

The Obama administration has been particularly sensitive about security of U.S. government employees in Libya since the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. mission in the country's second largest city of Benghazi that killed ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The administration is still fending off criticism from Republicans and others that it did not either enhance security in Benghazi or evacuate the mission due to rising violence in that city in the months prior to the attack.

The Benghazi mission was abandoned after that attack and never reopened. The embassy In Tripoli has been operating with reduced staff since but has remained open even as the violence intensified.

On Friday, U.S. Ambassador to Libya Deborah Jones appealed for fighting near the embassy to stop. 'We have not been attacked but our neighborhood a bit 2 close to the action,' she tweeted. 'Diplomatic missions 2 B avoided pls.' On Sunday, Jones tweeted about 'heavy shelling and other exchanges' of fire in the vicinity of the embassy and speculation about the potential evacuation had been rife at the State Department for more than a week.

Clash: Smoke rises over the Airport Road area after heavy fighting between rival militias broke out near the airport in Tripoli July 25, 2014

Libya is now witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gadhafi's ouster. In Tripoli, the militias are fighting mostly for control of the airport. They are on the government's payroll since authorities have depended on them to restore order.

The U.S. is just latest in a number of countries to have closed down their diplomatic operations in Libya. Turkey on Friday announced that it had closed down its embassy and militia clashes in Benghazi have prompted the United Nations, aid groups and foreign envoys to leave.

In Tripoli, clashes near the international airport have forced residents to evacuate their homes nearby after they were hit by shells. On Friday, the official Libyan news agency LANA reported that explosions were heard early in the day near the airport area and continued into the afternoon.

The battle in Tripoli began earlier this month when Islamist-led militias — mostly from the western city of Misrata — launched a surprise assault on the airport, under control of rival militias from the western mountain town of Zintan. On Monday, a $113 million Airbus A330 passenger jet for Libya's state-owned Afriqiyah Airways was destroyed in the fighting.

The rival militias, made up largely of former anti-Gadhafi rebels, have forced a weeklong closure of gas stations and government offices. In recent days, armed men have attacked vehicles carrying money from the Central Bank to local banks, forcing their closure.

Libyan government officials and activists have increasingly been targeted in the violence. Gunmen kidnapped two lawmakers in the western suburbs of Tripoli a week ago and on Friday armed men abducted Abdel-Moaz Banoun, a well-known Libyan political activist in Tripoli, according to his father.

An umbrella group for Islamist militias, called the Operation Room of Libya's Revolutionaries, said in a brief statement on its Facebook page on Friday that 'troops arrested Abdel-Moaz over allegations that he served under Gadhafi' and 'instigated rallies against' the Islamists.
