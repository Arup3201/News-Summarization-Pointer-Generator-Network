A cruise ship retracing the Titanic's voyage was forced to turn back yesterday after a passenger suffered a suspected heart attack.

The MS Balmoral was heading out into the Atlantic when it had to change course back towards Ireland after BBC cameraman Timothy Rex fell 'seriously ill'.

Mr Rex, 56, was airlifted by coastguard to hospital when the ship reached the helicopter's range – 130 miles from land. The incident is the second to beset the cruise ship.

It was delayed by gales and 30ft waves
 just hours into its voyage as it crossed the Irish Sea after leaving 
Southampton on Sunday.

The captain had planned to reach the 
Titanic's wreck site in the North Atlantic for a memorial ceremony to 
mark the moment the liner struck an iceberg on April 14, 100 years ago. 
However, there are now fears the ship will fail to make it to the site 
in time. One passenger said: 'There is a bad feeling on board that maybe
 the voyage is doomed by bad luck.'

The Balmoral had been carrying 1,309 passengers – the same number as were on the Titanic.

Among them are relatives of those who lost their lives, relatives of survivors, historians and journalists.

Mr Rex, who works for the BBC's West 
of England news channel, was in high spirits when the ship stopped at 
Cobh, on Ireland's south coast, according to a source. 'It's just 
terrible that this has happened during such a historic trip and everyone
 is just hoping to God Tim will be all right,' the source added.

Mr Rex is understood to have suffered chest pains. It was feared he could have had a heart attack.

The coastguard helicopter landed at 6.50pm yesterday on deck ten and airlifted Mr Rex to a hospital.

He had already received medical treatment on board.

Earlier Kirsty Gardner, one of the BBC film crew, had written about the excitement among her colleagues about the journey.

'In just a few minutes we set sail for
 the Titanic wreck site,' she wrote on Twitter before leaving Ireland. 
Yesterday dozens were queuing up for sea sickness tablets outside the 
medical centre as many struggled to cope with the choppy conditions.

The Met Office said that sea conditions off the coast of southern Ireland were 'rough or very rough'.

The Balmoral continued its delayed journey late last night.

From the wreck site, it will go to 
Nova Scotia, where some of the Titanic's victims are buried, and then on
 to New York, the destination the ship never reached.

A spokesman for the Titanic Memorial Cruise said: 'A guest has been taken ill on board the Titanic Memorial Cruise . . .

'Once the guest is off the ship for medical treatment the cruise will resume as scheduled.'

The Titanic hit an iceberg on April 14, 1912 and sank the following morning, claiming the lives of 1,517 passengers and crew.

On the anniversary, passengers on the 
12-night cruise will gather for a memorial ceremony at 11.40pm – the 
time the ship hit the iceberg – and again at 2.20am the following 
morning to mark the moment it sank.

Emotional relatives of victims of the Titanic today threw roses off the Southampton dockside in memory of their loved ones during a moving 100th anniversary memorial service.

A minute's silence was also held today in remembrance of the 1517 passengers and crew who lost their lives on the famous liner's ill-dated maiden voyage.

The south coast city has special reason to mark the Titanic disaster, as 538 of the 714 crew who died on the ship hailed from Southampton.

At the time it was said that almost every person in the city was either related to or knew someone who died.

Events began just before midday when nine wreaths were thrown into the Ocean Docks at Southampton, Hants, where most of the crew had lived.

The minute’s silence was concluded by a haunting recording of the Titanic’s whistle which was sounded three times around the port.

Every vessel in the port then proceeded to sound their whistles in sombre acknowledgement.

Shortly after, a re-enactment of the ship’s departure from berth 44 at Ocean Dock on April 10 1912 was staged.

A flotilla of craft followed the tug tender Calshot, which was built in the same era as the legendary liner, as it sailed towards the Solent.

Guests were then invited to throw their own rose off the dockside in memory of loved ones who lost their lives.

One of many to throw a rose into the water at the dock was Alan Stote, who was paying respects to his great uncle Thomas Instance.

Pensioner Mr Stote, 76, of Totton near Southampton, Hampshire, said: 'My grandfather’s brother was only 31 when he lost his life.

'He was a fireman aboard the Titanic. Although very upsetting, today’s event was well organised and very professional.

'I feel lucky to have been able to be a part of the day and pay my respects.'
