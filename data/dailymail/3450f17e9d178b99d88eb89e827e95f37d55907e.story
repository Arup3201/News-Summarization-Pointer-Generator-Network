The look in his eyes and the emotional tone to his voice tells you the extent of the pain Andy Murray feels about the ending of his history-making partnership with Ivan Lendl.

The Wimbledon champion described himself as ‘gutted’ that they will no longer be working together, after deciding they could not go on with an arrangement that was in danger of becoming ‘half-baked’.

In his first interview about the split, Murray last night revealed the pain he felt when a dinner with his mentor on Saturday evening to discuss how they might move forward turned into their last supper.

At the Australian Open in January, the  26-year-old compared the start of a player-coach relationship to having a new girlfriend: you might do everything you can to impress them in the first few months but let some effort slip when things become more familiar.

To extend that analogy, it is clear that breaking up has also been very hard to do. The British No 1 appears to be suffering a degree of inner  turmoil but that is hardly surprising when he has parted with someone who has changed his life.

‘That night it was tough,’ said Murray. ‘He was a big part of my life. We chatted for an hour about other stuff, then we chatted about moving forward.

‘The next couple of days for me on the court after that were not  particularly fun, but he is going to come and watch my matches here. I was gutted but I still think the guy is great. It’s not like anything has changed there. I will be disappointed for a few weeks but I need to try to move on.’

Mentor: Lendl is still expected to be in Murray's box when he plays his first round at the Sony Open

Slightly strangely, Lendl is expected to be in Murray’s player box tonight when the Scot takes on Australian Matthew Ebden in the second round of the Sony Open in what will be his first match since that fateful dinner last Saturday.

It is clear the situation with Lendl has been troubling him for some time, with Murray wanting more time from the 54-year-old Czech than he felt able, or willing, to give.

‘When there’s a chance that something like that might not work out, or maybe something is going on, it can be in the back of your head,’ the Scot conceded. ‘Maybe thinking about these kind of things for a couple of months can throw you off a little.

‘We planned to sit down when I got to Miami to discuss moving forward, but it wasn’t going to happen. He is a very hard person to replace, he made a huge difference to my tennis. The thing he was brought in to do was to help get me over the line and that’s what he did.’

It is absolutely clear that Murray did not want it to end. He revealed that their agreement was for Lendl to do 25 weeks per year with him in the first year, going down to 20 in the second. It was going to be less in 2014, and he felt that was not enough.

‘Ivan completely understands that as well,’ said Murray. ‘And that was why we decided to stop working together because it wasn’t going to be of benefit to anyone doing the job half-baked. That’s what Ivan’s like. He will do things properly, he doesn’t want to do it halfway.’

Murray sounds somewhat down in the dumps. It is hardly what he needs as he prepares to defend his title here and the large haul of ranking points that goes with it, with the chance of dropping to No 8 if it does not go well.

He conceded that he has not played as well over the past six weeks as he did at the Australian Open, even though in Melbourne he did not feel ‘physically quite there yet’ after back surgery in late September.

There was also the admission that he has just been through a tough week in Indian Wells, and that his overall form has been patchy of late.

‘Who knows? Maybe it is the spark that I need,’ said Murray, putting a brave face on things. ‘I have been in worse situations before and turned them around. I can see myself turning this around at some stage in the next couple of months. I know I will get myself up and play my best tennis in the Slams, I think my record in the last few years suggests that will happen.’

Next? Murray has hinted that he would like to bring in another former big-nam player to be his coach

It sounds as though Murray, having enjoyed such success with Lendl, would like another big-hitter who has experience of winning a Grand Slam, but he is also aware that they are in short supply, especially those who are willing to spend weeks and months away.

He stated that he intends to try and appoint a replacement before the French Open begins in late May.

‘It’s a possibility for sure, but again the situation has to work for everybody and there aren’t that many guys willing to travel and make sacrifices,’ he said.

‘I don’t want to rush it, this has to be for the medium to long term.’

At least Murray is not the only one with coach issues — Boris Becker will be absent from Novak Djokovic’s camp again because he has had to have more surgery on both his hips.
