Shoplifters caught stealing are being released by police and handed free food vouchers.

Officers across the country have been issued with the vouchers that allow criminals to collect three days’ supply of provisions donated to food banks.

Some shoplifters claim that they had no choice but to turn to crime to feed themselves or their families.

Some people believe handing out vouchers to shoplifters will encourage thefts

But critics have said giving vouchers to offenders rewards thieves at the expense of law-abiding citizens.

Hundreds of food banks have been set 
up by churches and community groups across Britain to give emergency 
food parcels to those in need.

Doctors and social workers can issue vouchers for food banks to those struggling to pay for food.

But the vouchers are also given to 
police officers, who are allowing criminals to go free with vouchers 
instead of being charged for them.

Staffordshire Police have handed out seven vouchers ‘to individuals in need’ since March.

In the latest case, an unemployed 
shoplifter was cautioned and given a voucher as he was released from a 
police station after admitting stealing from a shop in Hartshill, 
Stoke-on-Trent.

The man, who had spent his benefits 
on vet bills for his dog, said: ‘I was given a caution and well and 
truly learnt my lesson. As I was leaving, a sergeant beckoned me and 
said, “We don’t often give these out, but take this please.”

It was a voucher for a food bank which I redeemed the next day.

‘Humanity is alive and well. I apologise for my actions and am thankful we have such kind people working in the force.’

Staffordshire Police said: ‘The arrested man made an honest and frank disclosure. He handed the stolen food back straight away.

'A caution was deemed most 
appropriate. The custody sergeant deemed this individual met the strict 
criteria for a food bank voucher.’

However, the scheme was suspended in 
Staffordshire last night after local Police and Crime Commissioner 
Matthew Ellis ordered a review.

The scheme set up in March allows shoplifters three days' worth of supplies donated to foodbanks

He said it was ‘absolutely not acceptable that criminals should appear to be rewarded’.

Mr Ellis added: ‘It’s not the case in this situation but that’s what it looks like it and that’s something I can’t tolerate.’

Alan Joinson, chairman of East 
Bentilee Residents’ Association in Staffordshire, criticised the 
decision to give vouchers to offenders.

He said: ‘It is ridiculous. It is 
encouraging people to shoplift. They will think if they get caught they 
will get some free food. It will probably put people off donating. I 
wouldn’t want something I had given to go to a criminal.’

In south London, one of the 
Metropolitan Police’s safer neighbourhood teams has given out 75 
vouchers for the Norwood and Brixton food bank in six months.

Police community support officers in 
the West Midlands have issued vouchers to people they suspect to be a 
shoplifting risk as a ‘preventative measure’.

Food banks provide goods including milk, pasta, soup, tinned vegetables, fruit juice, tea and biscuits.

Chris Mould, executive chairman of 
the Trussell Trust, which runs more than 370 food banks and helped 
almost 350,000 people in 2012-13, said: ‘Food banks will not know 
whether someone has been cautioned or caught shoplifting if they are 
referred to a food bank with a voucher signed by a police officer.

It doesn’t say on it and should not 
say on it what the back history is, but it should say that the person’s 
need is genuine, that the person is in difficulty and needs emergency 
help.

‘That is what food banks are for – to provide emergency food for people when they are in trouble.

Because the public donate all the 
food, we need to assure them that we’re giving the food to people whose 
need is genuine... that is why we operate a voucher system with a whole 
range of professionals holding vouchers.

‘If police officers are able to 
choose an alternative way of dealing with someone who they believe is 
genuinely in trouble and has made a mistake, that actually costs the 
country less in the long term than taking them through the courts, but 
that is a judgment they make.’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘Lambeth police have given out 75 vouchers for the Norwood and Brixton food bank in the last six months. The vouchers were issued by response team officers who identified individuals or families in crisis during their day-to-day work.

‘The response has been extremely positive with all vouchers used and people helped who were not previously aware how they could access their local food bank. The vouchers have categorically not been given to shoplifters.’
