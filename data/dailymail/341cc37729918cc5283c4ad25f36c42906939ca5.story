Former independent MP Rob Oakeshott has made the stunning revelation that he once tried persuading Liberal MP Malcolm Turnbull to become a Labor minister.

Mr Oakeshott had hoped to see a Labor-led minority government, which mixed party boundary lines, while he was in talks with Julia Gillard after the 2010 election left a hung parliament.

Mr Oakeshott claims that during the period he had many private conversations with Mr Turnbull and proposed the idea of the now-Communications Minister joining cabinet in a Gillard-led minority government.

What could have been: Former MP Rob Oakeshott claims he approached Malcolm Turnbull after the 2010 election to propose he join the Labor party

Mr Oakeshott, pictured with Julia Gillard, envisaged a Labor-led minority government, which mixed party boundary linesÂ 

The details are revealed in Mr Oakeshott's memoir, The Independent Member for Lyne, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

The former MP's memoir recounts an intense 17-day period following the election which thrust the balance of power in the hands of Mr Oakeshott and fellow independents Bob Katter and Tony Windsor.

He claims to have sounded Mr Turnbull out over the extraordinary move.

'I tell him I would only consider being a minister in a Labor government if there were others who joined me,' Mr Oakeshott writes of Mr Turnbull in the memoir.

'I am now testing the waters with Malcolm, to see if he wants to be a minister in a Labor government, if he does I would be happy to propose it.

While Mr Oakeshott has admitted the conversations were nothing more than flirtatious, Mr Turnbull claims he can not remember the proposal ever being made.

In the memoir, the former MP also exposes James Packer's attempts to lobby him on a tour of the billionare's Crown Casino in 2012, when controversial gambling reforms were being discussed by the Gillard government.

The former politician said after sharing a meal, the casino mogul put the pressure on by making it clear he was very close with senior government members Stephen Conroy and Mark Arbib.

According to the claims, Mr Packer also told Mr Oakeshott he would use his network to protect his business if he needed to would hurt the government badly.

Mr Arbib, who resigned from politics in 2012, now works for Mr Packer and has refuted Mr Oakeshott's claims.
