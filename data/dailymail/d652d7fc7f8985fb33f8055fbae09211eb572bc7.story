Chris Froome admits the 2015 Tour de France may be too big a mountain for him to climb.

The 2015 route was unveiled in Paris on Wednesday and Froome said: ‘Next year’s Tour is going to be about the mountains. There’s very little emphasis on time-trialling which means the race will be decided up in the high mountains.

‘With six mountain-top finishes it is going to be an aggressive and massively demanding race.’

Froome, 29, won the 2013 Tour, but crashed out of this year’s race, which started in Yorkshire and was won by Astana’s Italian Vincenzo Nibali.

Rather than chase a second yellow jersey on the 2015 Tour, which starts in Utrecht on July 4 and finishes in Paris on July 26, Froome may instead focus on May’s Giro d’Italia and August’s Vuelta a Espana.

Froome was not in Paris on Wednesday, instead he was sailing in Weymouth with the British Sailing squad on a Team Sky training camp.

On seeing the route he made a statement on his website, saying: ‘The team and I will have to give it some careful consideration before we make any commitments to which of the grand tours I will compete in.

‘I see myself as quite a balanced GC (general classification) rider and the Giro with its inclusion of a long TT (time-trial) of 60km and tough uphill finishes will make it a well- balanced race which suits me. If I did the Giro I may also be able to get myself back in shape for the Vuelta and go there with a realistic chance.’

It was anticipated the 2015 Tour would be a vintage edition, with Froome, Nibali, two-time winner Alberto Contador and Giro d’Italia winner Nairo Quintana all chasing the yellow jersey.

The probable absence of Froome, twice runner-up in the Vuelta — including behind Contador in 2014 — would take the gloss off the race. But he added: ‘In the past I’ve only targeted one grand tour each season, but it could be a good opportunity for me to focus seriously on two.’

After leaving Utrecht the Tour de France travels through Belgium to northern France. Next is a transfer to the Pyrenees and a traverse across the Massif Central, with the decisive moments taking place in the Alps.

There are nine flat stages — good for sprinters like Mark Cavendish.

The OPQS rider was in Paris on Wednesday and tweeted: ‘Great route next year! Going to be some exhausted legs, but a good few stages for @opqscyclingteam’.
