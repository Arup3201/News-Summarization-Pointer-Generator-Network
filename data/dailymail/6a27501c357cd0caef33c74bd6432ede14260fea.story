A 22-year-old Canadian who moved to Bangladesh to go to medical school has died after apparently being struck by a train.

Mungerina Arabin Jerin, known as 'Jerin Mir', was walking with a male friend near a train station on Saturday night when the tragedy occurred.

The friend has been arrested on suspicion of murder after relatives of the student accused him of being involved in her death.

Jerin was born and brought up in Canada, although her family is originally from Bangladesh, according to the Daily Star, a local paper.

Her grades were not good enough to secure access to a Canadian medical school, so she moved to Bangladesh last year to train to be a doctor.

She was studying at the Medical College for Women in Uttara, a suburb of the national capital Dhaka, and living in college accommodation.

A relative told the Star that Jerin had visited her aunt on Saturday, then went for a walk with a friend, Mohiuddin Sharan.

She was then hit by a train, according to Sharan, and was taken to a nearby hospital where efforts to revive her proved unsuccessful.

Sharan was questioned by police after Jerin's death, and was arrested on suspicion of murder yesterday after relatives pressed charges.

One member of Jerin's family told the Star that witnesses had seen the pair fighting moments before her death, but that no one except Sharan had seen exactly how she died.

Friends of Jerin, whose family lives in Scarborough, a suburb of Toronto, took to Facebook to pay tribute to her.

'You had several talents, you were always so creative,' one said.

Another added: 'Still hard for me to believe that you're gone, RIP.'

A spokesman for Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs expressed sympathy for the young woman's death.

'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of a Canadian citizen who passed away in Bangladesh,' the department said in a statement.

'Canadian consular officials are in contact with local authorities to gather additional information and are providing consular assistance to the family as required.'
