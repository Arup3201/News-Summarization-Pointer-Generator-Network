A tide of litter which was thrown into the sea 50 years ago has been washed back up on some of Britain's beaches.

Crisp packets from Golden Wonder ready salted and salt and vinegar varieties dating back to the 1960s were among the rubbish plucked from the sand, with their colouful packaging barely faded.

Their 1967 and 1968 sell-by dates were still visible despite nearly 50 years swirling around in the sea.

Other bits of retro rubbish included a packet of Revels from 1983 and Lego pieces, which were washed off a container ship in 1997.

Conservationists Surfers Against Sewage organised beach clean-up events across the country last month, collecting 25 tonnes of rubbish.

They say that the fact some of the old rubbish is in near-pristine condition after all these years illustrates how litter can float around for decades without degrading.

Despite being swirling around in the sea for some time, this old rubbish is still clearly recognisable
