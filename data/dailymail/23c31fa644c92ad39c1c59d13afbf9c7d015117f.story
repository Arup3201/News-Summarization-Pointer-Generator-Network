As a household pet, they can squawk the squawk.

But one couple proved when it comes to one of London's most fashionable areas, their parrots can also walk the walk.

The unidentifed man and woman were spotted taking three of their colourful birds, as well as a dog, for their usual walk around the upmarket borough of Chelsea.

Unconventional: The man and woman took their three parrots and a dog for a stroll around Chelsea, London

Walk: The pair were spotted with the birds on their shoulders, while they led their dog on a leash

They led their dog on a leash during the daytime stroll while the feathered-friends sat on them throughout the journey.

Two of the blue birds perched on the man's shoulders, while the multi-coloured pet clung to the back of its female owner.

As they walked, the pair glanced into shop windows as passers-by admired the animals attached to them.

The man even chose to wear a jumper matching the colour of his companion for the leisurely walk.

The animals, which hail from tropical environments, are kept as household pets and can be affectionate companions who interact with their owners.

Attire: The man chose a jumper matching the feathers of his pets for the walk

Leisurely: The man and woman did not look phased as they walked past shops

Hiding: One of the parrots clambered onto the back of the woman, clutching to her jumper
