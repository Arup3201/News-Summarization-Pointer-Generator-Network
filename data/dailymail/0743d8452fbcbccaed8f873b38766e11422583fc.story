Aston Villa’s comeback king Alan Hutton, one of the so-called ‘Bomb Squad’ of high-earners that owner Randy Lerner wanted out of Villa Park, has admitted he thought he would never play for the club again.

Hutton, 29, was one of Villa’s stand-out performers in their impressive 1-0 win at Stoke City on Saturday to cap a remarkable turnaround in his fortunes.

The Scotland international has spent the last two seasons on loan at Nottingham Forest, Real Mallorca and Bolton Wanderers after manager Paul Lambert was ordered by Lerner to trim the wage bill by getting Hutton, Darren Bent, Stephen Ireland, Shay Given, Charles N’Zogbia and Barry Bannan out of the club.

Andreas Weimann’s winner means he has already equalled the tally of goals he scored outside Villa Park last season. His only away strike in 2013-14 came in a 2-2 draw against Liverpool last season. 

But with the American now wanting to sell the club, there has been a U-turn in policy and Hutton and N’Zogbia played at The Britannia with Given on the bench.

It was full-back Hutton’s first Premier League game for 27 months and he picked up a customary yellow card, for time-wasting rather than his trademark thumping tackle, as if he’d never been away.

‘It was a second debut for me. It was unbelievable to go away to Stoke and get the three points. Brilliant,’ he said.

‘To be honest, I didn’t see this happening. All I did was try to work hard and hope the chance would come.

‘I’ve been on loan to Spain and the Championship — that was down to wanting to play football. I’m not one of those players who is just happy sitting there.

‘Any opportunity I had to go and play, I was going to take it.’

Villa’s struggles over the past couple of seasons persuaded Lerner to let his manager pick the most expensive players in his squad again — including those he previously wanted bombed out because they had been signed during the Martin O’Neill and Alec McLeish years he has come to regret.

After Andreas Weimann’s 50th-minute winner, cheered from sidelines by Lambert’s famous new No 2 Roy Keane, the manager tried to explain Hutton’s long absence.

‘Everybody knew the finances were spiralling and we had to draw a line under it,’ he said. ’It was the case with Alan and a few of the lads.

‘But we move and if they (Hutton and N’Zogbia) keep playing like that, they will be fine.

‘Alan was outstanding, I thought the whole back four were. He has always been a really top pro. Even when he was out of the side there were never any cross words or anything.’

Villa’s deserved opening-day win matched their success at Arsenal a year ago. On that occasion, the promise evaporated quickly but this time Hutton believes it will be different particularly with star striker Christian Benteke due to return from an achilles injury in October and Colombian international Carlos Sanchez signing last week from Elche.

‘It’s a clean slate for everybody,’ said the right-back. ‘Everybody is being given a go and everybody has worked really hard over the pre-season.

‘I think people will be quietly surprised. They shot us down every early but you’ve seen us here and we did well going forward and at the back.’

Stoke’s optimism after signing six new players including Barcelona’s Bojan Krkic was pricked by being second-best to Villa. In the end, they were forced to send on Peter Crouch and resort to route one to try and grab an equaliser.

Manager Mark Hughes, who incurred a glare from his former United team-mate Keane when he expressed his displeasure about Villa time-wasting, hopes the loan signing of Victor Moses from Chelsea on Saturday will help his team recover.

Plan B: In the end, Stoke brought on Peter Crouch in their search for an equalising goal

Stoke moved for the left-sided Moses after failing to agree personal terms with Liverpool’s Oussama Assaidi and Hughes said: ‘We’re pleased we’ve been able to bring him in. That’s probably all our business done now.

‘We feel he’s a player who can give us pace and power which we probably lacked a bit on Saturday. He’s a young man who obviously hasn’t played a great deal over the last couple of years.

‘He wants to play games and that’s the opportunity he will get here.’

Hughes’ top priority in the coming weeks will be how to get the best out of Bojan who found his opening Premier League game a culture shock and contributed little after an early turn and shot which hit the side-netting.
