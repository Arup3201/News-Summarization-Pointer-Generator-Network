Manchester Untied's Darren Fletcher presented a donation cheque for £7,000 to the young patients at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Day Case Unit on Tuesday.

The United midfielder suffered from Ulcerative Colitis in the past, but is now fully recovered from the disease and is keen to help others who suffer from the debilitating bowel condition.

Fletcher’s visit to the hospital comes after the hugely successful 2014 United for Colitis charity fundraising Gala dinner held earlier in the year at United’s Old Trafford facilities.

United for Colitis is a new charity that raises funds for the patient charity Crohn’s and Colitis UK and as part of their promise to support people in Manchester who suffer with the condition.

Fletcher explained: 'United for Colitis is a fantastic opportunity to support a charity that helps an estimated 260,000 people in the UK with the increasingly common inflammatory bowel diseases, together known as Crohn’s and Colitis.

'We are aiming to provide vitally important funds to help support everyone with Crohn’s and Colitis and find a cure for these sometimes devastating inflammatory bowel conditions, which are usually more severe in younger patients.'
