Marie was nine years old when she was cruelly abused by our legal system. Her crime? To reveal she had been sexually abused for years, and then to have the courage to accuse her abuser in a court of law.  

Repeatedly accused of being a liar by the alleged abuser’s lawyer, the girl broke down time and time again until, eventually, the judge decided he must stop the trial to bring Marie’s ordeal to an end.

Yet there would have been medical evidence and corroboration from other children to support her story, if only the jury had been allowed to hear it. As it was, the child and her family have been left deeply traumatised, and the alleged abuser walked free. A terrible double injustice.

Her case - by no means untypical - is the perfect illustration of why our current adversarial legal system, based on live cross-examination, is unfit for purpose and fails to produce justice for abused children. I believe the savagery of live cross-examination is the reason many abusers are able to prey upon children for decades, without ever having to answer charges in a court of law.  

For even when a child has the courage to ask for help, even when they go to the police and agree to give evidence in court, in every case I know of, the police and lawyers have either refused to take the case to trial or tried to persuade the child’s family not to pursue their complaint. So it seems to those families that our law is siding with the abusers.

As the founder of ChildLine and a trustee of the NSPCC, I believe now is the time to bring in a simple reform, and pre-record those cross-examinations. This way, these vulnerable children can answer the lawyers’ questions without fear that the eyes of their abusers and the court are on them.   

If the questioning is pre-recorded it doesn’t have to take place in the gladiatorial environment of the court with the barristers playing to the jury.

It can be calm and private, with barristers using language appropriate for a child. The nature of the exchange can turn into one that is focused on the child rather than the jury.

At the moment, matters are cruelly different. In one of the recent trials of the wicked Asian sex gangs who prostituted children, a victim was so distressed by her cross-examination that she ran out of the court. 

'The defence barrister had to do was to ¿break down¿ the children, then the judge would stop the case'

In another trial, the lawyer played to the jury by asking a toddler to define truth: a philosophical conundrum that would stump many adults.

I am not alone in my view these interrogations should be pre-recorded. Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, and the Attorney General agree. It’s a reform that was first recommended by a Home Office Committee in the Pigot Report more than 20 years ago.  

Now it’s up to the Ministry of Justice to put pre-recording into practice, but the stumbling block, they say, is the expense. How much can it cost? And have they counted the cost, in human misery and in cold pounds and pence, of allowing dangerous child abusers to go free? 

Marie’s story tells us everything that is wrong with our system. Her police statement had been crystal-clear as she described the sexual abuse she suffered. It had become so bad she couldn’t sit down, and the man who abused her had threatened to kill her mother if she told anyone. She believed him.

Her grandmother, Louise, had tears in her eyes as she listened to Marie’s account. But there was worse to come. Marie was about to undergo live cross-examination via a video link.

It had taken the family great courage to reach this point. For Marie’s mother, Jean, had been advised by a Crown Prosecution Service lawyer not to allow her to give evidence. ‘It’s a game you cannot win,’ the barrister had told Jean.

He explained that the children would be first to give their evidence: so all the defence barrister had to do was to ‘break down’ the children, then the judge would stop the case.

Jean was shocked. She believed that all Marie had to do was tell the truth. She and the other families agreed to stand firm and give all the children the chance to give evidence.

The cross-examination began gently but the style of questioning quickly changed. Marie’s grandmother explains: ‘It was as if the barrister was going for the kill. She told Marie she was lying. Marie stayed strong that first time and said she wasn’t, but then the barrister started to criticise her mother.

The barrister accused Marie of lying for a third time, and she burst into tears (picture posed by model)

‘The barrister accused Marie of telling lies to help her mother, and this time she couldn’t answer because she was crying so hard.’

The judge suggested Marie take a break. As a potential witness, Jean, wasn’t allowed in the courtroom. She was downstairs with the other children. 

Jean says: ‘The police and the prosecution barrister came into the room and tried again to persuade me to stop the trial. The lawyer said Marie had broken down under cross-examination and that I ought to take her home.

‘I asked if I, or someone, could speak to Marie to see what she wanted to do, but they refused. One of the other mothers begged me not to stop the trial. Her daughter Angie had been told in therapy that once she’d told the court what had been done to her, she could leave the memories of the abuse behind, so Angie was desperate to give evidence. I said the trial must go on.’

The barrister accused Marie of lying for a third time, and she burst into tears. The judge stopped the trial again, warning: ‘This process is abusive. I must warn you if it continues to upset the child, I will have to stop the trial.’

Marie was given another break. ‘I felt alone,’ she said. ‘What made it hard was knowing the man who’d done it was looking at me.’ The cross-examination continued until Marie was silenced by her sobs. ‘The judge stopped the trial - he said he was doing so to protect Marie’s mental well-being. None of the other children could give evidence, and the man was acquitted.’

When the case collapsed, Marie was taken to her mother, who says: ‘She was shaking. She kept apologising to the other children. Angie was hysterical, because she couldn’t give evidence. All the children were in tears and their parents were in pieces. The barrister told us to go home, have a good summer and forget it. How could we possibly?’

Wigs off

Children under the age of 14 do not have to give an oath in court and the judge is expected to remove his gown and wig

At least the case had reached court. The majority of children who ring ChildLine to report abuse never reach a court of law.

The man who was acquitted lives near Marie, so, as her mother says: ‘We can meet him any time. The biggest problem is Marie is still frightened. He’d told her I would die if she told anyone, and now I’ve been diagnosed with cancer, Marie feels she’s to blame. 

‘I once considered driving my car over a cliff with the children in it because I can’t bear what’s happened to my family.’

The tragic legacy of sexual abuse is that victims feel they must be to blame - Marie’s mother most of all because she allowed her daughter to give evidence.   And yet she was right. Our legal system must not be treated as a game. We must allow justice to prevail. And only when families like Marie’s are prepared to tell their story can we make the changes that are so necessary.

For hers is a tragic story but by no means an unusual one, which is why I appeal to lawyers, judges and the Ministry of Justice not to tolerate this abuse of children in our courtrooms for a moment longer, but to champion the reform which is long-overdue.

A defence lawyer who had been cross-examining a child in an abuse case once told me: ‘I don’t care how great a monster my client is or what it takes to break down a child, it’s my job to do it and I will.’A chilling thought. For Marie’s sake, and for the sake of all the thousands of children whose voices have not been heard, we need to act now before more dangerous abusers go free.
