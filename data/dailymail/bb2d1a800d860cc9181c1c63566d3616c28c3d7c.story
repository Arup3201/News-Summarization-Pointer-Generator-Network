A convoy carrying the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was pelted with eggs and rocks by a swarm of protesters in the Philippines.

Around 100 members of the League of Filipino Students (LFS) stormed past police and threw red paint and eggs on vehicles in Clinton’s motorcade on Wednesday morning in Manila.

The motorcade was driving away from the Malacanang Palace, where the 64-year-old had met with President Benigno Aquino III.

The main body of the convoy turned around and took another route, while police and heavily armed presidential security troops cleared the protesters.

The protesters attempting to block the convoy and kick the vehicles opposed a 12-year-old voluntary forces agreement between the U.S. and the Philippines. 

The agreement exempts U.S. military personnel charged with committing crimes in the Philippines from prosecution under Filipino law.

Shortly after the  incident, a protester disrupted a public forum with Clinton to urge an end to the pact. Clinton said the protest was a sign that 'people are unafraid to express themselves' in the Philippines.

The State Department confirmed the incident and said that Clinton's car was not hit. Deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner said: 'The secretary's motorcade ran into a crowd of approximately 40 to 50 people, protesters.

'They threw objects at the lead vehicle - I believe it was eggs and paintballs, they maybe threw rocks - and the motorcade pulled out of that area and went to the next scheduled meeting place.'

Clinton was in the Philippines for a commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defence Treaty.

As part of that treaty, she signed the Manila Declaration binding the countries to work together on a variety of mutual interests.

She also revealed she would provide a second warship to the ill-equipped Philippine military as it confronts China in increasingly tense territorial disputes in the South China Sea.

Clinton's two-day stay in Manila, which culminated yesterday evening, also saw her holding a bilateral meeting with Filipino President Aquino III.

She participated in a social media interview on live television at the city's National Museum, and meeting with the staff of the U.S. Embassy.

And her windswept hair did not deter her from a speech in front of U.S. personnel aboard the warship the USS Fitzgerald.

Signing the deal: Clinton yesterday also signed the Joint Statement of Principles on the Partnership for Growth in the Malacanan Palace in Manila

She then jetted off to Bangkok, Thailand, where she held a bilateral meeting with Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.

While in Thailand, she pledged $10 million in aid and the assistance of a U.S. naval ship for flood ravaged Thailand.

She announced the assistance after talks with the Thai PM, saying that the USS Lassen had docked at a Thai port with crew and helicopters to assist in recovery efforts and assess ways to restore the country's infrastructure.

Her visit coincided with that of United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who said he was 'deeply saddened and humbled' after viewing the affected areas, adding that the world body is ready to help the government's relief efforts.

Clinton also visited an evacuation centre for Thai flood victims.

She played with a toddler and asked a little girl if she was missing school, after exchanging the traditional Thai greeting known as 'wai'.

She bowed deeply while pressing her palms together near the face – with some of the 1,400 evacuees currently living in the Ratchamangala National Stadium complex.

Following her whistle-stop stay in Thailand, she flew to Indonesia's Bali island for a summit, where a regional maritime dispute with China is expected to top the agenda.

Clinton’s plane landed at Bali’s international airport in the capital Denpasar.

She will hold talks with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) whose leaders are meeting ahead of Saturday’s wider East Asia Summit.

U.S. President Barack Obama will attend the summit which takes in Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, and this year welcomes the US and Russia as new members.
