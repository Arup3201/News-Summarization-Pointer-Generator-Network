From dealing with the menopause to battling empty nest syndrome, life isn't always easy for women beginning their sixth decade.

Looking good: Life coach Rebecca Perkins has written a guide to handing mid life in style

But that could all be about to change thanks to an unusual new self-help tome penned by over-50's blogger and life coach, Rebecca Perkins.

In Best Knickers Always: 50 Lessons For Midlife, Perkins reveals how women in their 50s can be happier, healthier and sexier than ever before - even if divorce has left them to navigate the murky waters of later-life dating.

'I’ve spoken to a number of women about later life dating and their experiences vary incredibly,' explains Perkins.

'Many are terrified of having 
sex again, they are worried about their body shape and they fear this 
level of intimacy.

'For others it’s the not knowing what to say or how to
 be on a date, it’s been such a long time since they dated.

'They are 
worried about online dating as they focus only on the horror stories 
they’ve heard from others. They worry about being hurt as they may well 
still feel bruised from the ending of their previous relationship.'

That, however, doesn't mean their worst fears are founded and Perkins, who is divorced herself, has a wealth of tips to share.

'I’d say firstly know why you are dating: Are you looking for a long term partner, companionship or perhaps some no strings fun?

'That 
way you’ll know what type of person you’re looking to date. Don’t go on a
 date with a person who says they want no strings when you are looking 
for a long term relationship. It will end in tears.

'Secondly, 
make this fun, relax and enjoy it. You might make some really good new 
friends. Thirdly, have a positive attitude and be open-minded. You 
never know who you might meet.'

1. Learn to love yourself, truly accepting who you are.

2. Do what you love. Rediscover your passion and pursue it.

3. Nourish your body - feed it well and exercise.

4. Meditate or find time for solitude

5. Make gratitude for all that is good in your life a daily habit.

But it's not just the challenges of dating later in life that confront today's over-50's. There's the question of maintaining your looks, reappraising long term relationships and most importantly of all, carving out a new role in the family once adult children have left home.

The solution, says Perkins, is to approach things positively and see them as an exciting challenge rather than the end of life as you know it.

'Midlife can be a very exciting time if you choose to look at it in a different way,' she explains. 'You need to ask: "How do I 
want to live the second half of my life?", "What have I been putting off 
doing that now I can get started on?", "What dreams have I put on hold 
because of my responsibilities to everyone else?"

'Yes, this takes courage
 but it’s also important to ask these questions because you really 
don't want to get to the end of your life filled with regret.'

Next comes learning to appreciate yourself for who you are - grey hair, wrinkles and bulkier bodies included.

'We look in the mirror and expect to see 
the girl we once were,' explains Perkins. 'The media is full of youth, vibrancy, 
skinny bodies and shiny white teeth and if you compare yourself with that, then it's no wonder you have low self-esteem.

'The women you should look up to in 
midlife are those with an inner beauty. Their self esteem and 
wisdom comes because of the life they have lived.

'I have lines on my 
face, I have a shock of silver hair, my body bears witness to the three 
children I carried and bore.

'Do I wish I was 21 again? No! I have accepted who I am and my self esteem does not depend 
on what my body looks like.'

And there's certainly no shortage of glamorous over-50s women seemingly bent on proving that good looks aren't just for 20 and 30-somethings.

Sharon Stone, 56, becomes more of a bombshell with each passing year, while Michelle Pfeiffer, 56, Julianne Moore, 53, and Andie MacDowell, 56, all look better than ever.

Nevertheless, for many over-50s, dealing with midlife is something they need to be supported through and for this, nothing beats enlisting the help of grown-up children.

'My children have been amazing,' says Perkins. 'They have
 loved and supported and encouraged me on this journey.

'I think showing your 
vulnerability to your children is vital. I think you become more 
approachable when you say: "I can’t do this alone" or "I need some help".

'The children of the midlife woman can really help just by being there 
for her, listening and understanding what she’s going through, even if it’s tough for them too. Change is never easy.'

Nevertheless, Perkins, who says that the main thing holding over-50s women back is fear, says that with a little belief and courage you can become the person you always wanted to be.

'If I could offer just once piece of advice to those women hitting their 50s, it would be: "You
 have more courage than you believe",' she says.

'Courage is sometimes simply finding the strength to face
 another day. Courage is learning to let go and to start again. Courage is 
having faith in yourself.

Smiling, she adds: 'It’s one of  my favourite lessons in the book.'
