At the school my two eldest children go to they have a unique form of parental torture surely invented purely to make my life a misery once a year.

‘Open Homework’: these two words do not belong together do they? Like ‘sugar’ and ‘free’ or ‘drink’ and ‘moderation’ they should never be in the same sentence.

So, what, exactly is ‘Open Homework’? Well, it’s just like normal homework — only worse.

Lorraine has recently come into contact with 'Open Homework' which has seen her attempt various dubious tasks including knitting in order to encourage her daughter's creative thinking 

It’s the kind of homework the tyrannical teacher from Matilda would set; Miss Trunchbull homework.

The idea behind Open Homework is to encourage creative free-thinking in a young mind (a dangerous concept to start with for my rebellious pre-teen girls).

What happens is a subject is given and you can do whatever you want with it: build a sculpture, write an essay, set it to music, turn it into performance art, make an omelette; anything as long as you can explain the mental acrobatics which helped you come up with your idea in the first place.

Lorraine says that working full-time and Open Homework does not mix

Past themes of this annual working-mum-stress-increaser have included ‘flight’ and ‘black and white’. I marvel at some of the pupils’ resulting creations, really I do. Even though parents are forbidden from helping, some of the work is so magnificent it looks like it has been handed in by architect Zaha Hadid or crafted by Professor Brian Cox.

Ours, however, tend to end up looking like they’ve been made in the craft room at a lunatic asylum by an inmate with questionable motor skills.

This is because I really do try not to help, despite Open Homework sucking up most of my evenings and once waking me up in the middle of the night with a nightmare about the toddler getting hold of the wood glue and sticking a rug to the floor.

This project throws me into a week-long Sunday-night-gloom, looming large in the lengthy daily to-do list because my children enthusiastically throw everything they have got at it.

When I suggest a little editing of their ideas, some focus perhaps, or possibly a less ambitious ‘build’, as Kevin from Grand Designs would say, I am shushed.

I am sent out with a shopping list that once included ‘something that looks like a bug’s eye’.

We’ve made board games, built aeroplanes and once Gracie asked me to construct a life-size model of a Friesian cow. Even Blue Peter couldn’t do that, I say, but she replies: ‘Maybe we could knit one and stuff it.’

In a busy household of four children aged three to 12, this kind of project takes over. Bits of the different creations are to be found drying/setting/cooking everywhere.

On Sunday I heard Gracie describing Open Homework to her grandma on the phone: ‘It’s this fun thing we do that Mum hates,’ she said.

‘Mum sort of comes up with an idea and then we do it for her.’ I feel the meaning of the mission has been lost.

This year we have the number ‘100’ as the theme — no doubt inspired by the centenary of the war. Of course Gracie does not want to do something so obvious as this anniversary. ‘God mum, everyone will do that,’ she says. And so begins the fraught discussion of ideas.

She will have ten, develop five into an embryonic project for which all manner of empty jam jars, egg boxes, candles and silver paint will be required. By day three of Open Homework I will feel like lying down in the middle of the road clutching a sign saying ‘do not resuscitate’ as she narrows down her choice to one idea.

The girls approach this with far more enthusiasm than any other homework. Perhaps because of my antipathy they love it as much as I fear it.

Maybe if I didn’t work I would have more time and enjoy taking part? Maybe not.

I find normal homework, especially maths, gruelling but this no-rules homework pains me more. And we never have enough glue.

We have now come up with an idea after hours of discussion. Does anyone know where I can get something that looks like a small marsupial?
