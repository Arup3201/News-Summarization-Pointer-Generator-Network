Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s tepid endorsement this week of President Barack Obama’s decision to swap five Guantanamo Bay detainees for an American soldier held hostage by terrorists is raising red flags among parties familiar with her position on the issue when she was in the president’s cabinet.

Asked Monday about the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, Clinton refused to levy criticism at her former boss for trading terrorists for the soldier, who professed unpatriotic views of his country and willing left his post on the night the Taliban captured him.

‘This young man, whatever the circumstances, was an American citizen – is an American citizen, was serving in our military,’ Clinton told her audience during a lecture in Broomfield, Colorado.

‘I don't believe in second guessing people who have to make these hard choices,’ she said of the ‘tough’ decision Obama made.

The former Obama administration official may be second-guessing her own choices, however. Her support for Bergdahl's freedom conflicts with descriptions of her perspective three years ago.

Change of heart: Secretary of States Hillary Clinton lobbied the White House against trading five Taliban leaders for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, but potential presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now refuses to criticize the Obama White House's deal

In a 2012 Rolling Stone article, journalist Michael Hastings described Clinton as being 'very wary about making a swap for Bowe.'

Hastings, now deceased, insinuated that Clinton and then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta didn't want to make the trade because they didn't want the U.S.'s counter-insurgency strategy, the Afghanistan troop surge, to be viewed as unsuccessful.

'Panetta and Hillary don't give a s*** about getting him home,' a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the negotiations reportedly told Hastings. 'They want to be able to say they COINed their way out of Afghanistan, or whatever, so it doesn't look like they are cutting and running.'

A Clinton spokesman did not return MailOnline's request on Tuesday to confirm Hastings’ characterization of the former secretary of state’s previous views on Bergdahl’s release, and a follow-up question asking what had changed Clinton’s thinking. 

Since then, three former administration officials familiar with Clinton’s position on the issue when she worked at the State Department told The Daily Beast that Clinton was in fact ‘wary’ of making a deal, and that her unwillingness to make the trade stemmed from distrust of the Taliban or Bergdahl’s captors, the Haqqani network in Pakistan.

‘She was heavily involved from the beginning, she was very skeptical of the arrangement, she was very wary of it,’ one official said. ‘If we had come to some agreement she perhaps would have backed it, but we never got to that point.’

‘She was felt that the Haqqani network were really bad guys,’ Democratic Congressman Jim Moran said. ‘She was reluctant to enter into negotiations with them.’

Three intelligence officials also confirmed to the Daily Beast that then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was also against the deal, as was Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who still serves in the administration.

If Clinton had her way, they said, the U.S. would have released three of the detainees as a show of good faith, and released the other two prisoners 60 days later. At that point Bergdahl would have been released as well.

It begins: Clinton has attracted controversy since her days as first lady, but with a likely presidential run in her future conservatives are ramping up the pressure; this pair demonstrated against her outside a Broomfield, Colorado speaking engagement on June 2

Clinton’s plan would have also required the Qatari government to surveil the released Taliban fighters, and the prisoners wouldn’t have been allowed to travel out of Qatar ‘until there was peace,’ The Daily Beast reported.

‘Break ties with al Qaida, renounce violence, and abide by the Afghan constitution, and you can rejoin Afghan society,’ Clinton told the Taliban in 2011. ‘Refuse and you will continue to face the consequences of being tied to al Qaida as an enemy of the international community.’

The plan that president Obama ultimately went with only slaps the released Taliban fighters with a one-year travel ban. Other details of the deal are being kept secret.

‘The talks evolved. The fact that we are going to be pulling out of Afghanistan shortly meant that the likelihood of retrieving Bergdahl was diminishing,’ Rep. Moran said. ‘And once the war in Afghanistan is over, some will argue that we no longer have a legal right to detain the Taliban.’

Moran, now in his twelfth term in Congress, is retiring at the end of this year, and has less to lose from sharing sacred details of the Obama administration’s talks with the Taliban than many of his colleagues, who may have to work with Clinton, a presumed 2016 candidate and frontrunner, again some day.

Clinton’s 
comments on Monday about the delicateness of negotiations do not 
directly contradict with her past sentiments, as described by others.

‘You
 don’t want to see these five prisoners go back to combat. There’s a lot
 that you don’t want to have happen. On the other hand you also don’t 
want an American citizen, if you can avoid it, especially a solider, to 
die in captivity,’ Clinton said.

Selective memory: Clinton dished to People magazine this week about her aspirations, her health and her marriage, but didn't touch on the history of how Bergdahl's release was negotiated

‘I think we have a long way to go before we really know how this is going to play out.’

But Clinton did not come out and disparage the plan, which she was reportedly against as secretary of state, either.

Clinton may have decided not to vocalize her disappointment with the deal after secretly meeting with president Obama late last week.

Lawmakers believe its possible that Obama discussed his already announced decision to pull troops out of Afghanistan with Clinton, as well has the Bergdahl deal, as the meet-up came just two days before Bergdahl was officially released by the Taliban.

‘It would be 'fair game' to ask Clinton if she did indeed know about the trade before it took place, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told The Hill.

‘“Did she know about this, what does she think about it, does she agree with the decision to withdraw troops in 2016?”’

‘These are all really good questions potential candidates for president need to answer,’ he said. 'This has ramifications long term for the U.S., this prisoner swap.’

'If Mrs. Clinton remains politically active, people will want to know what her advice was on the subject,' Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said.

If Obama did tell Clinton, 'it would be outrageous that he notified someone who's outside government before he would even notify members of Congress,’ Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told MailOnline.

Neither Obama’s nor Clinton’s camps will give out details on the meet-up other than to say Obama and Clinton had an 'informal' lunch at the White House.
