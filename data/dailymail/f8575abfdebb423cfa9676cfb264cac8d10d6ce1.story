Thousands of ‘kitchen table’ entrepreneurs could be forced out of business by a new EU tax law, it is claimed.

From today, all companies selling digital products – including e-books, music downloads and even knitting patterns – must navigate a hugely complicated VAT system.

Critics say even the smallest businesses may have to hire accountants and spend hours on paperwork, forcing many to close.

The new law requires firms to charge VAT based on the country where the buyer lives, rather than where the seller is based. 

It aims to stop multinational corporations such as Amazon undercutting rivals by setting up headquarters in low-VAT countries such as Luxembourg.

But the clampdown means fledgling businesses must now record which European country each customer is from and charge their national VAT rate. They must also keep hold of customers’ home and bank addresses for ten years.

Enterprise Nation, a campaign group which represents small and micro-businesses, believes around 250,000 companies will be affected by the change.

And Chas Roy-Chowdhury, of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, described the administrative burden on small firms as ‘unacceptable’.

‘The Government must look at exempting the UK’s smallest businesses from this, or risk them withdrawing from trading in Europe all together,’ he said. 

‘Ministers must come up with an exemption and take it to the European Commission.’

HMRC has already introduced a scheme designed to ease the strain of the new law, called the VAT Mini One Stop Shop, or VAT MOSS. 

It allows businesses to make a single quarterly VAT return, rather than having to register separately for VAT in each of the 28 EU member states.

But entrepreneurs still say they are going to struggle. On a Facebook page dedicated to abolishing the new rules, photographer Martin Wilson said he will be closing the online part of his business.

‘The administration burden, risk and cost of complying far outweighs the business I do with the EU. I don’t want the hassle of being an unpaid tax collector,’ he said.

Others said they were removing their own products from sale, while one businesswoman said she had spent months trying to understand the legislation.

A spokesman for HMRC said they were providing help for businesses and would be monitoring the impact of the changes.

Case study: Interior designer's petition over new tax legislation

Interior designer: Issy Zinaburg has spent months working on a new venture selling online courses

Interior designer Issy Zinaburg has spent months working on a new venture selling online courses.

At eight months’ pregnant, the designer had hoped the downloadable guide on how to decorate your home would allow her to earn some money while on maternity leave.

But now, new tax legislation introduced by the European Union could render this part of her business untenable.

The law requires that all businesses – however small – must track where each customer is from and charge them their national rate of VAT.

The rate varies wildly across the 28 EU member states and will require significant administrative work to maintain, she says.

Mrs Zinaburg started a petition in protest which has since gathered more than 21,000 signatures.

The designer says the new legislation will ‘cripple, and potentially force into closure, thousands of micro-businesses across the UK’.

The 33-year-old, who lives with her husband Amir in Suffolk, said: ‘I have a traditional interior design business but I am currently pregnant and I had hoped that taking my business online would be more flexible around childcare.

‘Offering online courses would allow me to take some time off after the baby is born so that I am not working all the time.

‘I had a number of courses planned which would include PDFs, pre-recorded videos and worksheets to show people how to do their own home. But I have now had to scrap a number of products.’

Mrs Zinaburg, of the EU VAT Action group, believes that she may be able to circumvent the changes if she includes enough ‘human interaction’ in her tutorials and online courses, but says that understanding how the new rules will work has been a huge headache.

She said: ‘Everyone agrees that the loopholes used by the big companies like Amazon should be closed, but the unintended consequence is the impact on small businesses. The administrative burden on micro-businesses is huge.

‘For some micro-businesses, it might be that they only need to charge £10 VAT a year, but the work involved in recording where the money is coming from and where it should go is just not worth it for them.’
