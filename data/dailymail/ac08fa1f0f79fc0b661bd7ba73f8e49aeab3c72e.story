A teenager who stabbed a radio journalist more than 50 times must serve 25 years to life in prison, a judge said today.

John Katehis, 18, murdered  47-year-old George Weber after they met on Craigslist and arranged a sexual encounter at the broadcaster's home.

Katehis, from Brooklyn, New York, winked and smirked in his videotaped confession and during court proceedings.

Justice Neil Jon Firetog handed down the maximum sentence at Brooklyn Supreme Court to Katehis who was dressed in a suit and tie and and had his hair closely shaved.

Prosecutor Anna-Siggac Nicolazzi called Katehis' brutal slaying of Mr Weber in March 2009 a 'thrill kill', according to the New York Daily News.

The murderer carried out the crime when he was just 16.

She said: 'This is exactly the kind of person society should be protected from.'

However the family of the ABC reporter showed compassion for the teenage killer.

Mr Weber's brother-in-law faced Katehis in court, saying: 'I forgive
you. I have no hatred.'

At his sentencing, Katehis said: 'For the death of George Weber, I am sorry. I regret it.'

The 18-year-old had been in court last year but proceedings ended in a mistrial. However a second round of jurors rejected Katehis' claim last month that he had acted in self-defence.

The two men met via Craigslist, where Katehis advertised sexual services and Weber had posted that he was looking for someone to smother him.

Mr Weber was found stabbed to death in his apartment in Brooklyn on March 20, 2009. His pants and underwear were at his ankles which has been duct taped, according to an autopsy carried out at the time.

He had injuries to the neck, chest and back along with stab wounds on his hands, indicating he had tried to fight back.

Katehis was taken into custody five days later after he was found hiding out at a friend's apartment.

On a MySpace page, Katehis has posted a series of photos with various knives, one with the caption, 'Love this blade'.

He described himself as 'a very easy person to talk to', but also as 'an Extremist, an Anarchist and a Sadomasochist'.

According to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Katehis had once appeared in court with 'Prince of Darkness' scrawled on the sides of his shoes.
