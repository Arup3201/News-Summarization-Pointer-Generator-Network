Stoke City defender Robert Huth has been reported as a potential target for Championship sides Fulham, Reading and Watford.

The combative centre-back wants to move to a Premier League side but Stoke like the idea of him going to the Championship as it will allow them to recall the 30-year-old should they pick up injuries.

However, the Berlin-born former Chelsea defender would prefer a permanent move to a Premier League side.

Meanwhile, the Baggies are also considering a £4million bid for Lokomotiv Moscow's Vedran Corluka.

The former Spurs and Manchester City defender has been plying his trade in the Russian Premier League since 2012 and has been linked to a move back to the English top tier
