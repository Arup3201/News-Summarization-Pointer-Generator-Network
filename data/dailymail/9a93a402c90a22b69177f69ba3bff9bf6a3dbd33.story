A grieving widow was ignored by Spirit Airlines when she asked for a refund on an airline ticket following her husband's sudden death.

Catherine O'Connell was left devastated when she lost her husband John in July. The widow, who is living on a limited income, contacted the airline to get the money back for his ticket for a flight they had planned to take to New Jersey.

Mrs O'Connell, from Palm Bay, Florida, enlisted the help of her family to send off all the correct paper work including her husband's death certificate, but received no reply.

Stress: The widow, who lives on a fixed income, tried to refund her late husband's plane ticket but was initially ignored by Spirit Airlines

She told Action 9 on Tuesday: 'I can't handle it. I'm too upset. I'm too emotional... I don't know why they can't take care of it.'

The grieving widow said that the cost of the plane ticket was a lot to her.

Although the O'Connells' tickets were not refundable, there is a clause for refunds when there is a death in the family or serious illness.

After being contacted by the TV station, Spirit Airlines offered its condolences and gave a full refund to the family.Â 

According to the New York Times, the Transportation Department receives six to eight complaints per 100,000 Spirit passengers. The industry average, meanwhile, is 1.4 complaints per 100,000 customers.
