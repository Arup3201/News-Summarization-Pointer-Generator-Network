A Florida mother was tragically shot and killed in her home as she was preparing for her 7-year-old daughter’s birthday party.

Lydia Bradford was murdered around 12pm on January 21, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, after a man with a gun burst inside her Cocoa, Florida, apartment and fired shots at her and her mother.

At the time, Bradford’s three daughters, ages 7, 4 and 1, were playing with a friend in a front room near the entranceway as neighbors were on their way over with a birthday cake.

Murder victim: Lydia Bradford was shot and killed around 12pm on January 21, Martin Luther King Jr. Day as she was preparing for her 7-year-old daughter's birthday party

Tragic: Bradford¿s three daughters, ages 7, 4 and 1, were playing with a friend in a front room near the entranceway when an armed man came into the apartment

The armed man entered the front door, which had been left open, scaring the girls away, police told NBC News.

As the unidentified man moved into the apartment, the girls reportedly ran to a neighbor's home to get help.

While the children nervously tried to explain what had happened, gunshots rang out.

The intruder sprayed gunfire at Bradford and her mother, Equaller, 58, in the back of their apartment.

Equaller Bradford was hit in the face and chest and stumbled outside where she collapsed on the front lawn, police said.

Inside the apartment, Bradford reportedly lay severely wounded, bleeding from her upper body.

Caring mother: Bradford, a single mother, grew up in the area and studied at a nursing school aimed at helping young women get their careers on the right track, a relative told reporters

Goodbyes: Bradford's grieving family members buried her on Saturday, February 2.

Neighbors who had heard the gunshots told police they saw a man run from the scene, leap over a wooden fence and disappear. One of the neighbors dialed 911.

‘I got a lady laying out on the lawn out here,’ he told a dispatcher. ‘They're saying there's a lady shot inside.’

Another man called 911 from Bradford's apartment and asked for an ambulance to come immediately. ‘Please hurry,’ he said.

The dispatcher reported that he heard a woman howling in the background, ‘She's dead, she's dead.’

The dispatcher asked who did it and the woman yelled back, ‘a man with a ski mask on his face came and opened that door and just shot 'em.’

Medics loaded Equaller Bradford onto a helicopter to take her to a nearby hospital.

Police searched the Central Florida neighbourhood by helicopter and on foot, using dogs to trace the killer's path along the fence. The dogs lost the scent, but police found a discarded handgun.

The gun is now being examined to determine if it was the murder weapon, and if it will lead police to the killer.

No arrests have been made.

Family woman: When she wasn't working, Bradford focused on family events, including cookouts, card games and kids' birthday parties, her relatives said

Bradford's grieving family members buried her on Saturday, February 2. Her mother remained in intensive care in the hospital, and could not attend the funeral service.

Those who did attend included the lead detective on the case, who ‘was devastated’ by the sight of the weeping daughters, said Cocoa police spokeswoman Barbara Matthews.

‘Our investigators have taken this case so personally,’ she said.

Bradford was one of at least 91 people killed by gunfire in the U.S. during Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, NBC reports.

Her tragic death came as the nation continues to debate gun rights in the aftermath of the December 14 massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.

Bradford, a single mother, grew up in the area and studied at a nursing school aimed at helping young women get their careers on the right track, a relative told reporters.

Bradford landed a job and had recently moved to stay in with her mother.

The murder victim had loaded her Facebook page with self-portraits and snapshots of her and her three daughters.

When she wasn't working, she focused on family events, including cookouts, card games and kids' birthday parties, her relatives said.

Her daughters have been taken in by family members, the family's pastor, Randolph McGhee, told reporters.
