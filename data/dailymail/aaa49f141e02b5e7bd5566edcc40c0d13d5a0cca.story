TODAY show executives are hoping its new orange set signifies a new dawn for the venerable show, but critics and viewers aren't sold on the bright idea.

NBC's TODAY has been losing viewers since the badly-handled departure of Ann Curry in 2012 and network executives are clearly hoping the revamped set, as well as the addition of The Voice host Carson Daly.

As TODAY hosts Al Roker, Savannah Guthrie and Natalie Morales showed viewers around their brand new set, viewers took to Twitter to express their views on the decor.

For some, orange is the new black, but for others the new set missed the mark.

Jeremy Harris wrote, 'Not impressed by the "makeover"... new graphics are stylish by the new set looks like it's from the 70's.'

Ken Roberts tweeted, 'TODAY show debuts new orange set. As a result, Snooki and John Boehner will require GPS chip implants in case they blend in and get lost.'

'The new @todayshow set looks TERRIBLE!! I am sincerely shocked. It looks like 1973. And the burnt orange couch? I can't!' tweeted Ferocia Fatale.

Some critics were of the same opinion.

'NBC's venerable Today Show unveiled a new set and tried to unveil a new attitude on Monday morning, but the orange-tinged hues looked more than a little desperate,' wrote TV critic Scott D. Pierce in the Salt Lake City Tribune.

The New York Daily News describes the set as ' the way your TV screen would look if someone punched a hole in the top and poured in a glass of orange juice.'

The studio was renovated in just 30 days by a team of 200 people.Â 

It includes a new anchor desk that can spin 360 degrees, an 'interactive weather wall' made up of six screens that can come apart and the Orange Room, a digital studio that will allow multi-platform reporting and will be presided over by Daly.

A recurring sunrise motif - though some have pointed out that it actually looks more like a sunset - decorates the studio.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, executive producer Don Nash described the set as a 'hipster New York City apartment.'

A large burnt orange sofa dominates the main interview area and revealed a problem for the show's costume department.

Savannah Guthrie's hot-pink dress clashed with the orange hue, evoking the colors of a tequila sunrise - the costume department at TODAY will now have to take into consideration the clash-factor when dressing its stars.

TODAY is the cash-cow for NBC's news division, and the network is hoping viewers who strayed to competitor (and the top rating morning show for the past 55 weeks, breaking a 16-year winning streak for TODAY) Good Morning America.
