Furious residents have slammed a group of yobs who vandalised a Christmas tree dedicated to teen cancer hero Stephen Sutton.

Hundreds of yellow ribbons had been tied to the tree which was erected in the late teenager's town of Burntwood, Staffordshire last weekend.

But just days after his proud mother Jane switched on the lights in front of hundreds of supporters, thugs ripped off clusters of ribbons and smashed branches and lights.

Organisers say they may now be forced to erect giant fences around the tree  to prevent future attacks.

The yellow ribbons became a nationwide symbol of Stephen's battle with cancer as he raised £5million for the Teenage Cancer Trust before his death in May.

He touched people across the world when a bucket list containing the 46 things he hoped to do before his death went viral.

Stephen died in May aged just 19 after losing his fight with the disease.

His mother, 50, collected her son's posthumous MBE from the Queen last month.

Family friend Joanne Jarvis, who organised the tree ribbon tribute, said she had been left 'gutted' by the thefts.

She said: 'I am absolutely gutted. I have been in tears, how can anyone be so disrespectful.

'We had hoped it was the wind but we now know for certain they were pulled off deliberately.

'I am just disgusted. I had asked for a low fence but now the council are considering a higher fence after this weekend.'

Mrs Jarvis came up with the scheme to decorate the tree in yellow bows after noticing that those put up during Stephen's fight around the town had begun to weather.

She spent weeks selling the ribbons for charity, raising an extra £1,500 for Stephen's cause.

Now fellow residents are calling for the culprits to be punished.

Jeremy French, 45, a welder who lives nearby, said: 'It's disgusting, there is no way you would imagine something like this should happen.

'The police need to get looking at CCTV and find these vandals and punish them as soon as possible.

'It's just not on, they were bought for charity to remember a hero, I can't understand the kind of person who would think this is OK.'

Anne Timber, 67, added: 'You just wonder about some people these days. I hope they get what is coming to them.

'If local residents found out who did I they would have hell to pay, Stephen was such a shining light for our community.

'These common thieves are the exact opposite.'

Burntwood Town Council officer Brian Cooper said it wasn't the first time the town's Christmas tree had been targeted by vandals.

He said: 'In previous years youths have pushed the tree around but we sincerely hoped that with this year being dedicated to Stephen Sutton they wouldn't do it.

'However, they have knocked a handful of bows off, which we have reattached.

'We hope this will be the end of it. But if it does happen again we will not have much choice but to put up a two metre high fence.

'We don't want to have to do it, but stopping people from ruining the tree is our priority.'

Staffordshire Police confirmed they were investigating the vandalism.

Stephen Sutton was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in September, 2010. Despite initially entering remission, the cancer returned four months later.

By the following year, the cancer had spread to his pelvis and doctors diagnosed it as 'incurable', prompting the 19-year-old to draw up a 'bucklet list' of 46 things to do before he died.

During this time he skydived, played the drums at Wembley, wrote a book, got a tattoo, crowdsurfed at a concert and hugged an elephant.

Among his goals was a desire to raise £10,000 towards charity. However, his initial fundraising efforts quickly  snowballed far beyond anything he imagined, with the inspirational teenager triggering a movement that has gone on to raise £5million for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

On May 11 this year, his condition deteriorated and he was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where he passed away three days later.

His death was met with tributes from David Cameron, Ed Miliband, celebrities, sports stars and others. Last month, he was posthumously recognised with an MBE at the Queen's Birthday Honours.

Mr Cameron led tributes to the 19-year-old, praising his 'spirit and bravery', and hailing Stephen 'an inspiration'.

He said: 'A very, very bright light has gone out. I'm deeply saddened to hear that Stephen Sutton has died. His spirit, bravery and fundraising for cancer research were all an inspiration.'

Comedian Jason Manford, who helped to champion Stephen's fundraising, described him as the most inspiring person he had met.

Upon his death, Manford said: 'He was an incredibly positive young man and a credit to his family, to Burntwood and to humanity itself.

'The reason we took to him so passionately was because he was better than us, he did something that none of us could even imagine doing. In his darkest hour he selflessly dedicated his final moments to raising millions of pounds for teenagers with cancer.'

One of the items on Stephen's bucket list was to hug an animal bigger than himself. Here he is pictured being hugged by an elephant
