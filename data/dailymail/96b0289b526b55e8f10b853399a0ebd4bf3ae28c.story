Arsene Wenger didn’t mince his words in a brutal assessment of Arsenal’s capitulation at Stoke, branding his back four ‘soft’ and ‘tender’.

The Gunners were shambolic defensively and lacked gumption going forward as their winless run at the Britannia Stadium stretched to a fourth year.

Behind inside 19 seconds thanks to Peter Crouch, Arsenal conceded twice more before the break with Bojan and then Jon Walters pouncing on gifts. Goals through a Santi Cazorla penalty and Aaron Ramsey volley saw the visitors rally, but the damage had already been done.

Wenger believes Calum Chambers’ second half sending off late in the game was unjust

And Wenger, who asserts Calum Chambers’ second half sending off was unjust, couldn’t hide his frustration at a lack of leadership and organisation.

‘We gave them a present,’ he said. ‘We were too tender at the back from the start today. When we responded it was too late in the game. You have to be committed and focused from the first minute.

‘We were a bit soft to cope with what they offered us. Stoke started strongly and we were not decisive enough in the defensive challenges.’

Nineteen-year-old Hector Bellerin made only his second Premier League start and 22-year-old Emiliano Martinez was in goal; Wenger chose to bemoan a lack of experience in his back five - even though World Cup winner Per Mertesacker, Kieran Gibbs and Chambers were all available.

‘You have to give Stoke credit,’ he added. ‘I think we were a bit inexperienced at the back. We could not play Laurent Koscielny or Nacho Monreal.’

Koscielny wasn’t risked, sitting on the bench, and could only watch on as Arsenal floundered, with Wenger heavily criticising referee Anthony Taylor for sending off Chambers late on to compound their misery.

‘It was a bad decision. If Chambers has to go off today I’ll watch the game again with you and show five more players who should go,’ he said. Charlie Adam appeared to be one guilty party, grabbing hold of Alexis Sanchez’s neck in a tackle.

‘I don’t want to comment too much on the referee but watch the game again and watch what happened on the pitch,’ Wenger added.

‘I don’t think he deserved to be sent off compared to other people who put arms and elbows in faces.’

The Frenchman didn’t leave his dugout seat for the entirety - blaming the ferocity of the home crowd. Asked why he remained seated, Wenger joked: ‘One single reason. They love me so much here that I didn’t want to give them an opportunity to show me their love.’
