The cost of petrol varies across Britain with some garage’s prices varying by as much as 15p per litre despite being only a few miles apart.

Millions of people are likely to take to the roads before tomorrow’s August Bank Holiday, ignoring forecasts of rain.

The Sunday Express researched prices and found that in Great Dunmow, Essex, drivers were charged 140.4p a litre while 23 miles away in Ongar motorists had to pay just 127.4p a litre. Diesel prices were 145.4p but only 130.9p respectively. This means that a driver with a 50-litre tank would pay £6.50 more for petrol and £7.25 for diesel at Great Dunmow than a few miles up the road.

Prices vary across the country but can be as much as 15p a litre different for garages a few miles apart

The cheapest petrol and diesel in Essex was at Tilbury, 23 miles from Ongar. According to petrolprices.com garages in Spennymoor, Durham, and Eastleigh, Hampshire equalled Tilbury’s prices.

The most expensive petrol – an eye-watering 149.9p a litre – was to be found at Tighnabruaich, Argyll, ­followed by Barrow-Upon-Soar, Leicestershire, at 147p and the Scottish Highlands village Dalwhinnie at 145.9p.
