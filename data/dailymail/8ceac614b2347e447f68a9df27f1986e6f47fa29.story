Diego Costa has been rewarded for his fine Premier League start by being named August's Player of the Month.

The Chelsea striker scored four goals in three games as he began his English stay with a bang.

After a similarly strong showing early on in the season with Swansea, Garry Monk has scooped the manager's award. Monk's side won all three matches, including a victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford.

Costa has looked like the ideal signing for Jose Mourinho ever since touching down after a £32million switch from Atletico Madrid.

The Spain international netted on his debut against Burnley and again against Leicester before claiming a double in the 6-3 victory over Everton.

Top boss Monk was handed the full-time Swansea gig in the summer after impressing in Michael Laudrup's absence last season.

The Welsh side started in impressive fashion, giving Louis van Gaal a nightmare start at Old Trafford with a 2-1 win.

They have since added to their streak by taking maximum points from clashes with Burnley and West Brom.

Chelsea and Swansea play each other this weekend in a top-of-the-table clash.

And Blues keeper Petr Cech was another winner, albeit from last season, collecting his Golden Glove award.
