A ‘lenient’ nine-year jail term handed to a mechanic who beat his lover's newborn baby to death will be reviewed by the Court of Appeal amid complaints it was not long enough.

Michael John Pearce, 33, was convicted of the manslaughter of his former girlfriend’s six-week-old son Alfie Sullock after hitting him with a shoe and a plastic bottle.

But the motorcycle mechanic from Caerphilly, Wales, was cleared of murder - an offence which carries a mandatory life sentence – at Newport Crown Court last month.

He had offered to look after the newborn so his 29-year-old girlfriend, Donna Sullock, could have her first night out after giving birth on August 16 last night.

But in a 'momentary loss of control' he lashed out at the child, who died four days later suffering from bleeding on the brain.

It emerged that Pearce’s outburst came just hours after his girlfriend told him she would not have a baby with him. 

Solicitor General, Robert Buckland, yesterday referred the sentence handed down to Pearce to the Court of Appeal as potentially unduly lenient. 

Former holiday rep Donna Sullock, from Cardiff, met Pearce while six months pregnant and started to spend most weekends at his house. She was on her first night out since giving birth when Alfie was killed

The move means that three appeal court judges will now consider whether the sentence is too short, and his jail term could be increased. 

Pearce was told by a judge that he could expect to serve half a custodial term in prison with the remainder on licence.

This means he could released from prison by early 2018 as he spent about a year on remand while awaiting trial.

The case is expected to be heard at London’s Court of Appeal within six weeks.

The attorney general’s office confirmed earlier this month that it had received about 10 complaints about the sentence. 

Mr Justice Baker asked whether jealousy had played a part in the killing during the trial last month.

He told Pearce: 'Alfie died as a result of you having inflicted upon him multiple blunt force injuries.

'It may well be that, due to your denials... whether you were motivated by jealousy as a result of Donna’s refusal to have your child earlier that evening.'

While babysitting Alfie in August last year, Pearce sent Ms Sullock a text saying: 'You can trust me you know'

And disputing Pearce’s mitigation, the judge added: 'This was not a momentary loss of control by a sleep-deprived parent. Alfie was only in your care for a short time.' 

Former holiday rep Ms Sullock, who lived in Cardiff, had met Pearce while six months pregnant and had started to spend most weekends at her boyfriend’s house.

Prior to her girls’ night out, she went to a local pub with Pearce - where he drank four pints of beer within an hour.

Pearce asked Ms Sullock to have a child with him - but she said no.

During the course of Pearce’s trial, the Crown said the defendant showed 'obsessive' behaviour towards Ms Sullock - and had showered her with gifts just a few weeks into their relationship.

Ms Sullock said that, when she left the house for her night out, Alfie was 'happy and healthy' and did not have as much as scratch on him.

While babysitting Alfie, Pearce sent Ms Sullock a text saying: 'You can trust me you know'.

But at 9.11pm he dialled 999, after claiming he had gone to the toilet and returned to see Alfie had stopped breathing.

When paramedics arrived moments later, they found the baby lifeless and blue.

Pearce was home alone babysitting Alfie last year when paramedics were called to his address in Nelson, Caerphilly, south Wales.

A trial at Newport Crown Court heard it was the first time divorcee Pearce had been left alone with the baby. Alfie died after suffering head and abdominal injuries.
