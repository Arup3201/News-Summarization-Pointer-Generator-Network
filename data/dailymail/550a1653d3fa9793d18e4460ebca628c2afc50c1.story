England's 'warm-weather' training for the World Cup didn't get off to the best of starts on Monday as torrential rain washed out their first training session at Barry University in Miami.

And when the clouds finally cleared, some of the players broke the monotony by taking a stroll round a local shopping mall.

Captain Steven Gerrard led the way as he stepped out with Glen Johnson, Phil Jagielka, Leighton Baines and Rickie Lambert at the Bal Harbour Shops.

They took the time to browse the latest designer trainers in one store but nobody appeared to part with any cash.

The group share a Merseyside connection, with Gerrard and Johnson getting to know new signing Lambert a little better after he joined Liverpool from Southampton for £4m.

Everton stars Baines and Jagielka were happy to tag along on the shopping expedition as England gear up for two warm-up friendlies against Ecuador on Wednesday and Honduras on Saturday.

England touched down in Miami on Sunday but a planned training session to blow away the cobwebs had to be moved indoors after heavy rain marked the beginning of the annual hurricane season.

Temperatures still reached 27C and 80 per cent humidity, not far off the conditions they will encounter in Brazil.
