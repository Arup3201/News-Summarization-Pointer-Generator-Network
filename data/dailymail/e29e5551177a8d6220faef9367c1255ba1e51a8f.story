Kell Brook is talking about fighting Floyd Mayeather or Manny Pacquiao, Juan Manuel Marquez or Brandon Rios — in no given order — before a Wembley blockbuster with Amir Khan sometime next year.

Nothing wrong with ambition but the first question Brook has to answer comes in his home town of Sheffield tonight.

It has less to do with his undeniable boxing ability than with whether he truly is recovered from the machete attack which inflicted horrific wounds to his left leg.

Brook assures us that all is well following that bizarre incident in Tenerife where he was celebrating the stunning win over American Shawn Porter which gained him the IBF world welterweight title.

Eddie Hearn, his Matchroom promoter, tells of how demonically Brook has laboured in the intervening six months to rescue his career from near death and the fear of never walking again.

But what no-one can know until he climbs into the ring as a world champion for the first time is whether there is any residual damage.

For a boxer there is more to getting better than for most of us. It is with the legs that a prizefighter exercises his thrusting mobility. It is from the legs that he generates the majority of his punching power.

Brook's attack left him with a 12-inch wound on his thigh and he has shown great strength to recover 

If either his balance or strength in that leg has been sapped, Brook will find it doubly difficult to perform at elite level. If both are reduced, he will be diminished.

Thus the examination about to be conducted by his moderate challenger, Jo Jo Dan, will be more medical than a test of Brook’s talent.

With older boxers it is the legs that go first. But you never find out for sure until he is engaged in the heat of battle.

Close scrutiny on Sky television will determine whether Brook, at 28, has been slowed prematurely.

A small impediment is unlikely to be enough to deprive him of a homecoming victory, even though Romanian- born, Canadian-based Dan insists he has prepared himself to shut out the roar of Brook’s partisan support.

But the issue is whether he wins in athletic style, with the ‘five-star performance’ he is promising his fans.

The local crowd, those of us at ringside and British boxing at large will be hoping he can.

If so, he will travel to Las Vegas for May 2 to be ringside for the Fight of the Century, eager to argue his case for meeting the winner of Pacquiao and Mayweather in a world welterweight unification fight.

That is markedly less likely to happen than an autumn fight with Rios, en route to an eventual showdown with Khan.

But if Brook puts on a show this weekend there would be no harm in asking.
