A British schoolgirl orphaned in the Alpine gun massacre said her father was standing next to her when the killer first struck, it emerged today.

It is the chilling testament of Zainab Al-Hilli, seven, which is helping detectives piece together the sequence of the quadruple slaughter in eastern France.

Zainab’s father, Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, and his 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila Al-Allaf, all died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire on September 5.

New developments: Investigators now believe French cyclist Sylvain Mollier was killed before the Al-Hilli family

But details of a new ballistics report leaked to Le Parisien newspaper on Friday suggest that French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old nuclear industry worker, was the primary target.

He was hit by the first stream of bullets before the ‘frenzied’ gunman turned his attention on Mr Al-Hilli, who had parked the family BMW in a layby close to the village of Chevaline.

Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor in nearby Annecy who is leading the investigation, confirmed that Mr Al-Hilli had got out of the car with Zainab, while denying that any conclusions had been drawn from the ballistics report.

But today senior police officers working on the Anglo-French inquiry confirmed that it was in fact Zainab who was supplying key evidence.

‘The little girl remembers key facts - her testament is crucial,’ said one, who said many of Zainab’s recollections were corroborated by new forensic evidence.

Sand and gravel was, for example, found on the soles of Mr Al Hilli’s shoes - proving that he had been outside the car.

He then got back into the driver’s 
seat, locked the doors, and tried to get away - but in his panic put the
BMW into reverse and became stuck in a muddy bank.

This allowed the gunman to fire bullets into the heads of all the seated adults, before returning to finish Mr Mollier off.

Mr Mollier’s glasses and bicycle pump were also found ‘a fair distance’ from where his lifeless body was found lying next to the car, said the source, suggesting it had been moved.

The first witness on the scene - an ex RAF serviceman from Britain - confirmed that the engine of the car was still running and all the doors were locked.

Zainab, who had been shot in a shoulder and pistol whipped around the head was also still outside the car - suggesting that her terrified family was about to leave her behind.

Her sister Zeena, four, was inside the BMW all along, apparently hiding underneath her mother’s dress, and was unscathed but severely traumatised.

Both little girls are currently back in Britain at a secret address where they are being looked after by family and social workers.

Mr Maillaud confirmed that British detectives were in touch with the girls, and were being kept informed about any information which they might offer of their own accord.

This means that there are no formal police interviews taking place - but Zainab is slowly being ‘coaxed’ into saying what happened.

One of her earliest recollections was that ‘one bad man’ had been shooting people, but more information is now being offered.

Mr Maillaud has been working on a theory that the atrocity was linked to a dispute Mr Al-Hilli was having with his brother, Zaid, over their father’s will.

But today he said that some £750,000 kept by the Al-Hillis in a bank account in Geneva - around an hour’s drive from Chevaline - remained untouched.

‘The account had not moved for a very long time,’ said Mr Maillaud.

Instead, the focus of the investigation is now on Mr Mollier, who was hit by up to seven bullets in the attack.

Until now he was regularly described by detectives as ‘collateral damage’ during what looked like the professional assassination of Mr Al-Hilli.

No family or friends of Mr Mollier have spoken about his death, nor released a photograph of the father of three, who lived in nearby Ugine.

A month ago his body was ‘temporarily buried’ in a secret ceremony, even though this went against the wishes of his relatives, who had asked for him to be cremated.

Forensic experts wanted to examine his body for clues, which would have been impossible if the remains had been destroyed.

Thirty people attended the funeral, which took place in a closed burial site which was deliberately kept hidden from the media.

French investigators are examining the theory that he may have led a ‘double life’ and been the intended target of the shooting.

Mr Mollier worked for Cezus, a subsidiary of the Areva Group, specialising in zirconium metalworking for nuclear fuel containers.

Cezus is owned by the Areva group which in 2007 was forced to deny a report in Der Spiegel that it had flouted UN sanctions by providing Iran with enriched uranium.

He had two teenage boys from a previous marriage while his new partner, a pharmacist, gave birth in June.

Mr Mollier was still on paternity leave and had been using his spare time to cycle around the countryside.

He was identified after his partner, worried about not seeing him return, alerted the police.

Police have also revealed they are looking for a motorcyclist who was seen in the vicinity of the crime scene at around 4pm - within half an hour of the killings.

A local farmer said he saw the rider looking ‘unsure of the route’, and struggling to manoeuvre his bike over pot-holed roads.

Brett Martin, a 53-year-old Englishman who used to be in the RAF, was the first to arrive at the scene of the carnage on his bicycle.
