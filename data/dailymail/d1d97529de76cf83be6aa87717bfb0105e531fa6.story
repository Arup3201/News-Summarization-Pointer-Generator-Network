Morgan Schneiderlin has warned Southampton he could leave in the summer if they fail to secure a place in next season's Champions League.

Schneiderlin, who is currently preparing for France's upcoming games against Albania and Sweden, was linked with a move to Arsenal during the summer transfer window - but was told he would not be leaving St Mary's.

Southampton have made a terrific start to the season under new manager Ronald Koeman and are second in the Barclays Premier League but their French midfielder has refused to commit his long-term future to the south coast outfit.

Speaking in an exclusive interview with the French Football Federation, Schneiderlin said: 'I just turned 25, I turned a corner.  I want to play for a big club as a career passes quickly.

'Today I am in Southampton. We are second in the Premier League, we have done well. We'll see  what will happen if we are still in the  Champions League places at the end of the season and I will make the choice. I will see with my club.'

The 25-year-old refuted claims he was considering the possibility of playing for England before he won his first France cap in June.

He added: 'I did all the youth teams in France, but I've never had contact with the [English] Football Association.

'It is the press who spoke in England, but in my head, I never wanted to change my nationality. My goal has always been to wear the blue jersey and play for France.'

Schneiderlin could partner Pogba in France's engine room against Albania on Friday
