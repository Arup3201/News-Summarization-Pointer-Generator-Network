A former NFL cheerleader accused of following a 12-year-old boy into a bathroom, fondling his penis and offering him oral sex has been spared jail, it has been reported.

Elizabeth 'Leigh' Garner, 42, who was charged with sexual battery and solicitation of a minor for child rape has instead been sentenced to 18 months probation, TMZ.com reports.

Garner is understood to have pleaded no 
contest in October. As part of her conditions she must 
stay away from the boy and his family, submit to drug testing and attend
 AA sessions twice a week.

Probation: Former cheerleader Elizabeth 'Leigh' Garner, 42, has reportedly avoided jail after pleading no contest to sexual battery and solicitation of a minor for 
child rape

Garner had been released on a $30,000 bond and had faced more than eight years' prison. She was expected to go on trial this month.

According to Murfreesboro police, the 
married Nashville woman, who cheered three seasons for the Tennessee 
Titans until 2008, was at a party in February when she tried to seduce 
the boy.

The boy told police that Garner asked him whether he'd 'ever been with a woman' before she tried to pull down him pants.

He then bolted from the bathroom and told his mother what happened, who reported her friend to police.

Garner
 later told detectives the alleged assault was all a 
misunderstanding, 'that she was drunk that evening and she got the boy 
confused with a man' who was also at the residence.

'That's 
just absolutely no excuse for sexual assaulting a child,' said officer 
Kyle Evans.

'If you can't tell the difference between a 12-year-old and 
an adult then there are problems.'

According to WTVF, Garner gained a
 measure of fame while she was in the Titans' cheer squad because, at 
38-year-old, she was considerably older than her fellow cheerleaders who
 were generally in their 20s.

Numerous health and fitness blogs featured the busty blonde and her secrets to staying in shape when she made the team.

The Titans said she hasn't had anything to do with the team for several years.

Garner
 and her husband, who she said on blog Chrissy Fitness in 2008 proposed 
to her during cheer-leading training with a dozen roses, seem to be 
sticking together through the allegations and defense that she thought 
the boy was another man.

They spoke with WTVF together, to proclaim her innocence.Â

In
 the interview with Chrissy Fitness, the 5' 2" tall 110 pound woman said
 maintaining her cheerleader-worthy body was hard work.

She said she 
hit the gym daily to maintain her envied physique, doing spins and turbo
 kicks and twice a week she factored in strength training with weights 
to sculpt her muscles.

When it came to her diet, she explained in the 2008 article that she stuck to 1700 calories a day and ate mainly vegetables.

'I've never been one to eat a lot of junk food,' she explained.
