Time Warner Cable told a man living in a rural area of Central New York that it would cost over $20,000 to connect him to broadband internet.

Jesse Walser of Pompey moved to the town of 7,000 residents ten years ago, reports arstechnica.com.

Walser, who works as a laboratory analyst at a beer brewery, is just one of the five per cent of Americans who live in an area that doesn't offer wired internet service other than dial-up.

Unfortunately wireless in Walser's only viable option and he never imagined it would be so expensive to obtain.

Not THAT rural: Jesee Walser lives in POmpey New York not far from a main road and just a third of a mile away from Time Warner Cable lines 

There are Time Warner cable lines less than a mile away from his home but the company still told him it would cost him $20,000.

A letter from Time Warner cable to Walser in April 2012 stated that in order to extend service to his home, cable to three homes in a span of 0.32 miles  would need to be built. that number adds up to 9.4 homes per mile. 

The letter also says that construction would cost $26,470. 

Time Warner Cable would only be willing to chip in $3,643, leaving $22,862.60 to be paid by Walser.

When Walser first moved into his home it only cost him a few hundred dollars to get a copper wire phone service.

Even though the home has a Verizon landline, DSL isn't an option in their area. Fios isn't an option either.

High price: A letter from Time Warner cable to Walser in April 2012 stated that in order to extend service to his home, cable to three homes in a span of 0.32 miles would need to be built

Splicing and Electronics: $5,916

'I would pay $1,000 for a fiber-to-the-home installation that promised cutting edge speeds without batting an eye—OK, maybe a small flinch,' he said. 'But not $20,000.'

'I didn’t think it would be that difficult, because the cable was on my road. I have phone. I have electricity. It’s not completely green acres. I don’t have to go up to the pole to make a call. I didn’t think it would be a problem,' he said.

As of the now the family pays $90 per month for 20 gigabytes of data from Millennicom, a company that resells Verizon service.

At this time that's the best the family can do if they don't want to use painfully slow DSL networks.

The family does most of their downloading at a family member’s home until a better solution comes along.

Rural customers may someday see fixed wireless technology but not at this time. Ten years ago Time Warner quoted $5,000 for service.

Who knows what it will cost years from now?
