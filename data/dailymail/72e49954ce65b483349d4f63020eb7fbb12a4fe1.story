The Marines who died in a helicopter crash during routine training included an expectant father, a father of two who was a former pastor and an experienced pilot preparing for his fifth tour of duty.

The names of the four other men who perished in one of the deadliest training accidents for years have not yet been released.

Crews have been working for two days to clean up the accident site on a sprawling desert range near Yuma, Arizona.

'He died doing what he loved': Thomas Budrejko's family has paid tribute to the fallen Marine

Among the dead was 25-year-old Lance Corporal Corey Little, of Fayetteville, Georgia.

Mr Little was also a Huey helicopter crew chief and he was expecting his first child with his wife Nicole in September.

Nicole Little described him as 'the best husband in the world', and added that he would 'always be there through the child', according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Mr Little's brother Nickolas also paid tribute to the 'great and loving' Marine - and said that he too planned to join the corps, 'not only for myself but also to honour my brother'.

'He loved the outdoors,' Mr Little's mother said. 'He loved to read. He was a very avid reader.'

Another victim was 33-year-old Sergeant Justin Avery Everett, who was aboard the Huey as a crew chief, his family said.

He had served two tours in Iraq and was about to deploy for a tour in Afghanistan.

Mr Everett, who leaves behind a wife, Holly, a five-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son, left a job as a youth pastor at a church in Fresno, California to join the Marines after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

He was a wrestler in high school, played the saxophone as a kid and participated in marching band in junior high school, according to his mother. He also traveled to Mexico for several weeks to serve as a missionary for his church.

'I saw him Sunday night, we came by to visit and he had walked me to my car and hugged me and kissed and told me, "Mama bear, I love you," and I told him, "Baby bear, I love you too,"' she said as she gathered with family to begin making funeral arrangements.

Mr Everett's brothers are also helicopter pilots.

Also among the dead was Major Thomas Budrejko, a Connecticut native and Cobra pilot who had served three tours in Iraq and was due to start a second tour in Afghanistan soon.

'He died doing what he loved to do,' Mr Budrejko's father told the Norwich Bulletin. 'He loved flying and he loved the Marine Corps.'

Officials said it could take weeks to determine what caused two helicopters, an AH-1W Cobra and a UH-1 Huey, to crash in midair during a routine exercise on Wednesday night, killing all aboard the aircraft. Skies were clear and the weather was mild.

The accident occurred near the Chocolate Mountains along the California-Arizona border - a sprawling desert range favoured by the U.S. military because its craggy mountains and hot, dusty conditions are similar to Afghanistan's harsh environment.

Chaplains and counselors were called in to talk to troops. Six of the Marines killed were from Pendleton, California and one was from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona.

All the Marines were part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. With 17,500 Marines and sailors stationed at Camp Pendleton and Yuma, the unit conducts hundreds of aviation training exercises a year so troops can get as much experience as possible before they go to war.

Two of the Marines who died were aboard the AH-1W Cobra and the rest were in the UH-1 Huey utility helicopter.

They were flying in a remote section of the 1.2-million-acre Yuma Training Range Complex as part of a two-week standard training called 'Scorpion Fire' that involved a squadron of about 450 troops from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing.

It was the fifth aviation accident since March involving the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing headquartered, at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego.

Throughout the Navy and Marine Corps, there have only been two other aviation training accidents in the past five years involving seven or more deaths, according to the military's Naval Safety Center.
