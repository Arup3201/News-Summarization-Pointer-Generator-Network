Princess Eugenie will make her New York debut within weeks – as she moves to the Big Apple to start work at a trendy auction house co-founded by one of Princes William and Harry’s multi-millionaire old school pals, MailOnline can reveal.

The 23-year-old graduate will be working for Alexander Gilkes, 34, the dashing Old Etonian brother of London nightclub entrepreneur Charlie Gilkes.

Both Alexander and Charlie were invited to Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton in April 2011 and Eugenie is a firm fixture in the same social circle, attending Alexander’s lavish nuptials to stunning fashion designer Misha Nonoo in Venice last year.

Friends say that Eugenie will be in New York by the end of the month and will then start work at Alexander’s auction house, Paddle 8, based in the city’s trendy Soho district.

Alexander’s links to the Royals go back to his school days at Eton.

His
older brother Charlie is a firm friend of Prince William and dated the 
Duchess of Cambridge’s sister Pippa after they were both students at 
Edinburgh Univeristy.

Charlie,
who founded London nightspots Maggies and Kitts, was even spotted on 
board a barge, the Spirit of Chartwell, alongside the Middletons during the Thames Diamond Jubilee
Pageant to celebrate the Queen’s Jubilee in 2012.

And Eugenie, alongside her older sister Beatrice were in attendance at Alexander and Misha's wedding last year, a three-day affair that saw the couple get hitched at the Forte di Sant’Andrea, a 16th-century island fort that had once guarded Venice and had before never been used for a private event - for which they had to obtain permission from the mayor of Venice.

Also in attendance were James Middleton, Kate and Pippa’s younger brother, while guests including bride’s cousin Houda Nonoo, the Bahraini ambassador to the U.S, multi-millionaire banking scion Matthew Mellon and Helen Rockefeller were treated to a performance by singer Lana Del Ray.

In fact, Alexander remains so close to the Royals that he was spotted out with Pippa Middleton, 30, during her visit to Manhattan last summer.

The couple were seen leaving Soho House - while Pippa was clad in a bright red dress designed by Mishal Nonoo.

And while it's as yet unclear where Eugenie will be living in New York, there's more than enough room at the Gilkes' new pad. Last month, they bought a sprawling Greenwich Village condo formerly owned by Nate Burkus, a frequent guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show until he got his own talk show - now axed.

The couple splashed out $4.95million on the 3,000 square feet pad that's spread out over two floors - and also features 1,000 square feet of outdoor private deck space.

The Daiy Mail was the first to report Eugenie's move to the States in June.

And although she will have to leave behind her Stowe-educated boyfriend Jack Brooksbank, who works in the gastro-pub trade, the two plan to commute whenever possible.

‘Since leaving university Eugenie has been committed to working in the arts world and has done some internships but is now set to take on a permanent role at graduate level,’ a friend of the Duchess of York told the Mail's Richard Kay.

Eugenie got a degree in Art History and English Literature at Newcastle University and will work in New York before returning to London to help set up Paddle 8 in the UK. She has already done a stint at auction house Christie’s, where her cousin Viscount Linley is chairman.

She
has also worked at the Royal Collection in Buckingham Palace, where she
won praise after queuing and joining fellow workers in the canteen 
there.

The move is significant for it comes in the wake of plans inspired by Prince Charles to slim down the number of front-rank working royals, which would almost certainly exclude Eugenie and her sister Princess Beatrice.

Following the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son, Prince George, Eugenie has now slipped down the line of succession from six to seven.

Status-driven Andrew has always 
insisted that as the only two ‘blood’ princesses, his daughters should 
be a central part of a working Royal Family.

But while devoted to the Queen, Eugenie is a modern young woman who wants to make her way in the world.

‘She is determined to be a working woman with a full-time job,’ according to her mother's friend.

A spokeswoman for Paddle 8, whose backers include art world luminaries such as Damien Hirst and Jay Jopling, said there were 'no updates at the moment.'
