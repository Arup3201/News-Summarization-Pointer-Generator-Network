Forget Tiger Mothers,Â the pushiest parents in the world are those who want their children to be the best in the cutthroat world of modern dance in the U.S.

British viewers will get the chance to see just how competitive the pastime is when the new series of Dance Moms airs on Lifetime next week.

The reality TV show goes behind the scenes at Pittsburgh's renowned Abby Lee Dance Company, owned and operated by the formidable Abby Lee Miller.

Checking up: The 'dance moms' watch as their children rehearse

Looking for the best: Dance teacher Abby Lee Miller, right, watches the girls perform

No sugar-coating: Miller isn't afraid to tell the children what she really thinks of their dancing

Competitive: The girls (and their mothers) are desperate to be the best

Best behaviour: How the mothers act can influence whether Miller gives their daughter a starring role

Miller is so determined to find the best dancers, she pushes children to be the best they can be - and doesn't spare their feelings if she thinks they are not up to scratch. Her appraisals of auditions make Simon Cowell look soft.

She uses phrases such as 'only number one is good enough!' and 'quit that crying cr**!' when the children perform.

Miller says: 'I'm not looking for somebody to be second place. I want a member who stretches every night before they go to bed, I want kids who can learn a routine in one day and compete the next. I want it all.'

She adds: 'I want kids that want it, that want to be the best they can be.'

At war: The dance moms compete with one another to help their daughters get ahead

Looking older than their years: The girls wear make-up and have perfectly groomed hair for their performances

Practise makes perfect: The boys and girls perfect their moves

Children can learn to dance at the Company from the age of two but Dance Moms follows a troupe aged eight and above who are competing to win coveted awards in solo and group categories.

Their routines must be flawless with an appearance to match. Sequined outfits, tonnes of make-up and perfectly groomed hair are all de rigueur.

And as the title of the show suggests, behind every girl vying to be number one, is a mother pushing them all the way.

This leads to bickering, back-stabbing and tantrums - all from the mothers.

'It's not fair! You get special treatment for your daughter!' says one of the mothers in the opening episode as they fall out over who Miller has selected to do the latest dance solos.

Pick me! The dancers compete for places in solo and group routines

In or out: Miller's decision is final when it comes to picking dancers for important performances

High standards: The dancer instructor is looking for girls who stretch every night and want to be the best

The girls are told: 'Second place isn't good enough'

Support: The mothers are there for every rehearsal and show

It seems the mothers have to fight one another to get their child ahead - as if they pick their battles with Miller, it's their child who will be punished.

One mother learns this at her daughter's cost at an open audition in Florida in the opening episode. When she tells Miller her daughter didn't dance well because she didn't hear the initial instruction to start on her left foot, the child is immediately dropped.

'Who is your daughter? You just humiliated her stage in front of all these people, she's out,' Miller shouts dismissing the heartbroken young girl from the competition.

One of the experienced 'dance moms' then tells the outspoken mother: 'A word of advice, don't speak out against Abby, she hates it when you stand up for your kid.'

As the mothers can't win against Miller, they wage war on one another instead. In the first episode of series four, which airs on Monday on Lifetime, they accuse one another of trying to sabotage one another's daughter's routines or trying to win Miller's favour by buying her gifts.

Expect high kicks and even higher drama as the girls dance ever closer to the National Dance titles in spite of their mothers' backstage breakdowns on Dance Moms, Lifetime, from Monday 16th June at 9pm
