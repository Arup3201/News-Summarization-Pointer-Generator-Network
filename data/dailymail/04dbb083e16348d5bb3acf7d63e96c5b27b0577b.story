A devoted brother who spent more than 60 years searching for his lost family, finally traced his siblings - and found they were living just doors away from one another.

Fred Hodgkins, 76, grew up knowing that he had a brother who was given away for adoption during the Second World War.

His mother Gladys, from Sheldon, Birmingham, had fallen pregnant with a son, Grahame, while her husband - also called Fred - was away on service in Egypt.

Grahame was put up for adoption and named Fred Ford by his adoptive parents.

But unknown to Mr Hodgkins, his mother fell pregnant a second time and gave birth to Carole 18 months later. She was was given to Gladys' best friend Connie Atkins, and her husband Bert, who were unable to have children.

'I remember coming home from school when I was five years old and there was a rifle and kit bag at the bottom of the stairs,' said Fred Hodgkins Junior, who now lives in Nuneaton with his wife Barbara.

'I thought my dad was home. But instead my mother was upstairs with another man.

'It always stuck in my head, but my mother never said anything about it.

'Months later, I came home from school again to find my mother upstairs holding a baby. My gran and my aunt were there, too.

'Mum said: 'We've only borrowed this little boy' and I held him in my lap. I knew deep down that he was my brother - but I never saw him again.'

The family were bombed out three times during the war - first in their home in Sheldon, then at Fred's grandmother's house in Ward End, and again at his aunt's home in Small Heath.

'I've never recovered from that,' says Fred, who received a neck injury during the first blast. 'It was terrible.'

His father Fred, by now a sergeant major in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, returned from a five-year stint abroad in 1946, and the family moved to his grandmother's home in Ward End.

After a turbulent reunion, Fred and Gladys went on to have another daughter named Pat.

Mr Hodgkins recalls: 'There was nine of us living in the three-bedroom home. No-one had houses any more - they'd all been bombed.'

He married Barbara in 1959, moved back to Sheldon and became the landlord of various Birmingham pubs. Both his parents died at the age of 65, in 1977 and 1978.

Mr Hodgkins first learned that he had another sister in the 1980s when he was told by an aunt.

He tried to search for his adopted siblings, but without success.

Then, in 2008, he received a call from an agency saying his brother Fred Ford had made contact - and wished to speak to him.

Mr Ford, now 70, had moved to Pembroke Dock in 1984 to run a pub with his wife Jane - but she tragically passed away from cancer in 1995, aged just 46.

'Fred Ford and I spoke over the phone and the next day he came up from his home in Wales,' says Fred, who now has two sons, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. 'We got on so well that he stayed for the weekend.'

Mr Ford, who lives with partner Jeanette and has two sons and three grandchildren, said of his remarkable reunion: 'I knew my birth mother's name and where I was born, so I tried to look for her many years ago," he says.

'But I got nowhere. I got fed up and left it.

'Then, around six years ago, as a result of my cousin looking for his relatives, I got in touch with an agency.

'Within two weeks they came back to me, saying I had two brothers and two sisters.

'My head was spinning. I never knew I had any siblings.

'I
 got Fred's phone number and thought I'd give him quarter of an hour to 
ring round his siblings to tell them about me before I called.

'But just 
then the phone rang and it was Fred, saying: 'I've been looking for you 
for years.'

'We got on really well. He's Fred No 1 because he's the eldest and I'm Fred No 2!'

'We
 were both amazed by the number of co-incidences in our lives. Not only 
were we both brothers named Fred, but we had also both worked as 
licensees.

'And, although I was raised in Leamington Road, Sparkbrook, 
when I married I bought a house on The Glade, off Coventry Road, Sheldon
 - just a stone's throw from where I'd been born."

The brothers finally managed to trace their sister Carole, who was living in Redditch, through an agency in Birmingham called After Adoption.

Fred Hodgkins says: 'We all met at my house and it was marvellous. She came with her husband and son, and our brother Fred came, too.

'It turned out Carole grew up in Ivydale Avenue, just around the corner from Cranes Park Road in Sheldon.

'She had walked past our house every day going to school, but I had never known who she was.

'Years later, she and her husband Ken used to drink in the Marston Green Tavern, where I was the landlord.

'I felt as though a part of me had been missing before I met Fred and Carole.

'Now it's as if we'd never been apart, even though more than 60 years had gone by. I look back and feel sad that we didn't meet years ago.'

Today the two Freds Skype each other every morning, Carole calls regularly, and they meet for lunch most Sundays.

Carole, 68, who has also met her other sister Pat and spoken to brother Bob on the phone, said: 'I'm really glad I know the story now.

'I'm sure lots of adopted people think 'My mother didn't want me then, why should she want me now?'

'But there's always a reason.

'My
 birth mother had a husband so she couldn't keep the two of us. When I 
learned she'd given me to her best friend, I thought that was lovely.

'I'm lucky, I've had a really good upbringing, I've always been really happy. I was brought up round the corner from where I was born.

'I feel sad that I never met my mother, especially now I know she didn't want to give me up. But it's lovely to have this family now.'
