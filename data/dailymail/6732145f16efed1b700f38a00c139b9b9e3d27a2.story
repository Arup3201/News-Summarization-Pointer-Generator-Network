Ukrainians stood in long queues in the bleak snow as they waited to receive humanitarian aid in Donetsk yesterday.

Lined up outside Donbass hockey stadium, hundreds of mainly elderly residents waited for the distribution of the aid packages, shipped across the border by Russia.

Kiev has cut aid to the eastern regions held by pro-Russian rebels since soon after Western-backed protesters toppled Ukraine's pro-Moscow president in February.

Donetsk is a stronghold of resistance to the country's new government and has been under daily shelling despite a fresh truce hammered out this week between government troops and militants.

Pictures from Donetsk have shown residential and official buildings alike shattered by artillery strikes, while Ukrainian officials accuse rebels of launching constant attacks from the city.

Russia's aid convoys are a lifeline for civilians and militants alike. Kiev and Nato accuse them of being cover for material support for the insurgency, claiming that weapons are being shipped along with food supplies.

Moscow denies using humanitarian convoys to transport weapons and rejects Western and Ukrainian accusations that it is arming the rebels and sending fighters to aid them.

It accuses the West and Kiev of pressing a campaign of indiscriminate violence in the eastern territories of Luhansk and Donetsk.

Today Russian President Vladimir Putin in a keynote speech said Ukraine had 'an inalienable, sovereign right' to its own path, but condemned what he described as a 'coup' that has brought the current government to power.

'What we are seeing now in Ukraine, the tragedy in the southeast, fully confirms that our position is right,' Mr Putin said. 'How can one support an armed seizure of power, violence, murder?

'How can one support the attempts that followed to suppress with the help of armed forces the people in the south-east who did not agree with this lawlessness?

'This is pure cynicism. I am sure that the Ukrainian nation itself will judge these events in a just way.'

Today U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Russia could rebuild its relations with the West 'if it simply helps to calm turbulent waters' on its border with eastern Ukraine.

Mr Kerry spoke at a meeting of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which includes both the United States and Russia as partners.

He met briefly - and separately - with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Georgian Foreign Minister Tamar Beruchashvili.

The OSCE has sought to help broker an enduring cease-fire in eastern Ukraine, where the West says Moscow is supporting the separatists with weapons and troops in their quest to secede from Ukraine's central government.

Mr Kerry called it a 'very turbulent year' and noted that when the 57-state OSCE met last year, Ukraine protesters were in the throes of demanding a new government in Kiev.

'They were warmed by a simple desire - to live in a country with an honest government,' Mr Kerry said at the start of the OSCE meeting. Over the past year, however, the fledgling leadership in Kiev has been beset by separatists in the eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk, and has seen the Crimea region vote to secede.

Mr Kerry said Kiev has been 'tested by external aggression' yet still is 'casting off the shackles of repression and opening a new and promising chapter in their nation's history.'

He called on Moscow to uphold an earlier cease-fire agreement, which calls for withdrawing its support for the separatists and persuading them to release hostages. The U.S. and European Union have imposed sanctions on some Russians and separatists as punishment for their actions.

Russia accuses the U.S. and other Western nations of having backed the coup in Ukraine. This week a U.S. citizen was incredibly appointed as the country's new finance minister.

Natalie Jaresko, who has worked in Ukraine for more than 20 years after holding various economic positions in the U.S. State Department, was approved in her new role on Tuesday.

Ukraine has been offered billions by international lenders if it carries out economic reform and President Petro Poroshenko said the administration would benefit from international specialist input.

Mr Kerry said it was the U.S. and its allies that supported Ukraine's sovereignty. 'It is not our design or desire that we see a Russia isolated through its own actions,' he said.

'No one gains from this confrontation.'
