Most judges will get to see some violent defendants in their time, but the majority of them will usually be well-behaved in the courtroom.

Not so for June Carson, who got so angry in court that he threw his backpack at Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Marilyn Cassidy in Ohio.

She had given him time to get an attorney and a new date to return, but he mumbled ‘I don’t think I’m going to do that’, before throwing his bag.

Attack: Defendant June Carson got so angry in court that he threw his backpack at Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Marilyn Cassidy in Ohio

Judge Cassidy ducked down and the backpack fortunately hit the bench in front of her, so she was not injured in the incident.

Carson was in front of her on a minor trespassing charge. He also turned to his defence 
lawyer, David Eidenmiller, and allegedly punched him too.

It just so happened that Police Union President Steve Loomis was already in court for the trial of two police officers, reported NBC Universal.

He jumped over a bench and table before grabbing Carson, after Judge Cassidy had pressed her emergency buzzer.

‘If you could go over a judge or police officer, you'll go after anyone,’ Mr Loomis told NBC. ‘It just shows how fast a normal situation can go bad.’

But Judge Cassidy did not seem too shaken up after the incident.

'It comes with the territory. A corporate job would be very boring'

‘It comes with the territory,’ she told NBC. ‘A corporate job would be very boring.’

She told HLN News that court security is 'pretty good', but she has a small courtroom so officials are looking at improving security there.

Carson is now serving 30 days in jail for contempt of court and will face more charges for the attempted attack, reported NBC.
