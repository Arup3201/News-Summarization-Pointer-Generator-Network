A Canadian skeleton slider was left to tackle an unfortunate obstacle as she was hit by a broom left on the track as she competed at the European championships.

Jane Channell was allowed to redo the run after the unfortunate incident, but ended up recording a slower time and initially placed at 15th.

Miss Channell was unhurt after the incident on Saturday when she collided with the large red broom, left on the track at Igls, Austria.

Jane Channell was hit by a broom left on the skeleton slider track in Igls as she went down for her first run 

It affected her momentum as she slid at around 30kmph. 

But the broom could have caused a far worse accident had it hit her when she was further down the track, where speeds get up to 120kmph. 

Her second attempt at the first run saw her record a time of 55.15 seconds. 

The event has been beset by problems after it was moved to Igls because of weather problems in La Plagne in France.  

The broom is thought to have been accidentally left near the start of the track by staff maintaining the route

Miss Channell's second run on the track was slightly better and she managed to improve her position to 11th overall. 

She also finished seventh on Friday during the double World Cup.  

Lizzy Yarnold from Britain won the Skeleton World Cup event in Austria after a successful second slide during the competition. She won both races on Friday and Saturday, the second doubling as the European championships.
