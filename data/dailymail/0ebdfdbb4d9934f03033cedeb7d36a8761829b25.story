Prime Minister David Cameron said it was his 'intention' for his children to go to a state school

David Cameron has said for the first time that he wants to send his children to a state secondary school.

Answering questions from youngsters in a new academy, the old Etonian said it was his ‘intention’ that his children would not follow in his footsteps and go to public school.

The Prime Minister said that what was happening in the state school system was ‘really exciting’. ‘I think there’s a revolution taking place,’ he said.

If he keeps his promise, it would make him the first Conservative PM to entrust his children to the state secondary education system while in Downing Street.

His openness about his children’s education is in stark contrast to his deputy Nick Clegg, who has always refused to answer the question.

It is believed that Mr Cameron wants to send his children to the new Kensington Aldridge academy, which is set to open in 2014 near their old family home in west London.

The two eldest – Nancy, eight, and Elwen, six – are already state educated. They go to St Mary Abbots CofE primary school in Kensington.

A decision on Nancy’s secondary education will be required before the next election, as she will soon reach the age of 11.

Their third child, Florence, is only two but it is likely that she will also go to a state primary.

Mr Cameron revealed his plans during a question and answer session at the John Cabot Academy in Bristol, where along with his ministers he had held a regional Cabinet meeting in the morning.

He said he wanted to send his three children to state secondaries, even though he himself went to Eton.

The Prime Minister was asked by pupil Reece Day, from the Bristol Brunel Academy: ‘If you agree with academies, would you send your children to an academy, rather than a public school?’

The Tory leader replied: ‘I’ve got three children, an eight-year-old, a six-year-old and a two-year-old.

‘My eight-year-old and six-year-old are at a London state school. It’s a church school but it’s a very good school and I’m very happy with it.

The Kensington Aldridge Academy, which is set to open in 2014, may be a state school but it's unlikely to ever be considered 'bog standard'.

While its admissions policy has not been decided yet, the policy is expected to be non-selective and community based.

However, its community is set in one of London's richest postcodes in the Royal Borough of Kensington and 
Chelsea where house prices nearby average £1million.

In its proposal to the council, the Aldridge Foundation, which is sponsoring the school, said it would: 'Provide a mixed 11 to 18 school with places for 900 11 to 16-year-olds and provide a sixth form for up to 240 students.'

The first group of 11-year-olds are expected to start in September 2014, with a second group starting the following September.

Among its aims are to 'provide a community entrepreneurial hub'.

‘I packed them off there this morning
and they’re not too happy about all these tests they’re having to sit 
but they are doing well.

‘I
would like them to go to state schools, that is my intention. What’s 
happening in the state school system I think is really exciting. I think
there’s a revolution taking place.’

It was reported last year that the Camerons were also considering two other London state schools — Grey Coat Hospital school, a Church of England girls' comprehensive in Westminster; and the new Chelsea academy in west London.

In 2010, Cameron said he was ‘terrified living in central London... Am I going to find a good secondary school for my children? I feel it as a parent, let alone as a politician.’

The co-sponsor of the Kensington academy is Rod Aldridge, a tycoon who had to step down from the Capita business services company after it emerged he had lent Labour £1million while it was bidding for government contracts.

When Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he attracted controversy by sending his children to the Roman Catholic London Oratory school. Critics said it selected by parental interview, which favoured the professional middle classes.

In addition, he and his wife, Cherie, used teachers from the independent Westminster school to give his sons Euan and Nicky extra tuition.
