Two members of the Government’s paedophile inquiry today faced resignation calls from victims who were allegedly sent threatening or insulting emails after they criticised the investigation.

Lawyers for abuse survivor Andrew Lavery have complained to Home Secretary Theresa May over messages from a panel member  - including an email sent two days before they were due to meet.

They claim Graham Wilmer threatened him after a social media row between another abuse victim and the panel member’s son, who tried to confront critics against his father’s place on the inquiry.

Mr Lavery's lawyer Alison Millar told the Observer that the 'private communications with our client, a man who is deeply traumatised by his experience of abuse, certainly seem ill-advised to us'.

Meanwhile former child protection manager Peter McKelvie has complained about an apparently inappropriate email from panellist Barbara Hearn - about whom he has previously raised questions.

Last week, the Mail reported how 23 victims of alleged historical child abuse had told Mrs May, 58, they were withdrawing support from the Government’s inquiry, claiming it was ‘not fit for purpose’.

Mrs May set up the inquiry into historical child abuse in the summer amid incendiary claims there was an Establishment cover-up of a murderous paedophile ring around Westminster in the 1980s.

But she has struggled to put in place a chairman retaining the confidence of victim groups. Fiona Woolf and Baroness Butler-Sloss have quit amid concerns about their close links to certain figures.

The latest developments will trouble Mrs May. A source close to the inquiry told the Observer that the emails should not have been sent, leaving the panel members’ fates in doubt.

A crunch meeting on Friday between Mrs May and some of the largest groups for child sex abuse victims was told that the allegations against panel members were being probed by an unnamed QC.

Mr Lavery - who has previously spoken of abuse at a Catholic boarding school - was first in contact with Mr Wilmer in summer last year, claimed to have received ‘unsolicited communications’ from the panel member after speaking out about the inquiry.

The abuse survivor was most concerned about an email sent by Mr Wilmer ahead of a meeting last month, which said he was ‘looking forward to meeting’ him and had been studying his tweets.

The message said: ‘The insults you have issued about me, I have no problem with - you are entitled to your opinion. However, what has been said about my son, Rory, is a different matter.’

Mr Lavery's team said that after the email, he 'did not feel comfortable about attending the meeting'. But Mr Wilmer has denied that he intended the email to be threatening, according to the Observer.

Mr McKelvie said he was worried that Ms Hearn used to work at the National Children’s Bureau, where a Paedophile Information Exchange member had a job as a consultant in the early 1970s.

He also has concerns about her alleged connections with social work managers from Islington Council in north London, where there is known to have been sexual abuse in children’s homes.

Fiona Woolf said in October that she had no choice but to quit as chairman of the inquiry after accepting the victims had lost all confidence in her ability to conduct the investigation impartially.

It followed sustained pressure over her links with the former home secretary, Lord Brittan, who is facing claims that he failed to act on a dossier of paedophile allegations in the 1980s. 

Her departure was a huge blow after the previous chairman, Baroness Butler-Sloss, also had to quit because her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, was attorney general during the same period.

Mrs Woolf's links to Lord Brittan came under scrutiny because he is likely to be called to give evidence to the inquiry about his handling of child abuse allegations.
