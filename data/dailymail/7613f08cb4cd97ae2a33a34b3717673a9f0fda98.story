The doctor convicted of killing Michael Jackson has spoken out for the first time to try to clear his name - and claims the superstar died of an accidental overdose.

Dr Conrad Murray told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I did not kill Michael Jackson. He was a drug addict. Michael Jackson accidentally killed Michael Jackson.’

The 60-year-old heart surgeon - released from prison three weeks ago, having served half of his four-year sentence for involuntary manslaughter – began working for Jackson in 2006.

But it was not until he went to help him prepare for his This Is It come-back tour in 2009 that he saw the devastation of his life.

‘He was in crisis at the end of his life, filled with panic and misery,’ he said.

‘By the end Michael Jackson was a broken man. I tried to protect him but instead I was brought down with him.’

Murray claims Jackson had been dragged ‘into the abyss’ of physical and mental anguish by the pressures of the tour.

He claims he lived in a state of 
paranoia and filth: maids were not even allowed to take his underwear to
 be laundered because he feared they would sell it.

Murray
 insists he was one of the few people the superstar trusted. ‘You want 
to know how close we were? I held his penis every night to fit a 
catheter because he was incontinent at night.’

The doctor said Jackson’ 5’11” frame had wasted to little over nine stone, he was suffering from chills, insomnia and mood swings and he was dependent on the prescription drug propofol to help him sleep.

Murray claims he had ‘weaned’ Jackson off the drug the singer called ‘milk’ only days before his death on June 25, 2009.

He believes his insomnia that night was due to withdrawal symptoms from another drug, Demerol, an analgesic better known as pethidine, which had been provided by another doctor without his knowledge.

In a claim, made for the first time, Murray insists that while he was out of the room Jackson got up and injected himself with a lethal dose of propofol after Murray had refused to give him the amount he wanted.

The heart surgeon claims he did everything he could to save Jackson. Whether or not you believe him, he has clearly convinced himself.

He says the singer had told him shortly before his death that their names would become ‘inseparable.’ When Murray asked him what he meant ‘he smiled and said: ‘I am clairvoyant.’

Murray has filed an appeal against his conviction.
