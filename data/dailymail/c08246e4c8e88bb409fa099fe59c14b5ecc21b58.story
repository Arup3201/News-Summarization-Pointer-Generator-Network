Dorset Police officers have been in touch with the Kuwaiti authorities as the remainder of the family all live in the Middle-Eastern state.

'My team and I are working hard to establish the motive for an alleged fatal attack by a father on his daughter.

'I can confirm that we are not currently looking for anybody else in connection with this death.

'The investigation will strive to establish all the available facts and I would appeal to anyone who can provide information on Mashael's last movements, or who was in St. Michael's Road at around 12.30pm on Sunday 30 March 2014, to contact Dorset Police on the non-emergency number or Crimestoppers to assist the ongoing investigation.'
