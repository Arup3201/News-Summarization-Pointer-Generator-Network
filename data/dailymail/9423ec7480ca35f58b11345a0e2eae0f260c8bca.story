San Francisco's iconic
 Golden Gate Bridge moved a big step closer to getting an oft-debated 
suicide barrier after bridge officials on Friday approved a $76 million 
funding package for a net system that would prevent people from jumping 
to their deaths.

The bridge district's board 
of directors voted unanimously in favor of the funding for a steel 
suicide net, which includes $20 million in bridge toll revenue. Federal 
money will provide the bulk of the remaining funding, though the state 
is also pledging $7 million.

A tearful Dan 
Barks, of Napa, who lost his son, Donovan, to suicide on the bridge in 
2008, said after the vote that he was almost speechless.

'A lot of people have done so much incredible work to get this accomplished,' he said.

After
 the vote, he rose from his knees and shared a tearful embrace with Sue 
Story of Rocklin, whose son Jacob jumped off the bridge in 2010.

'We did it, Dan! We did it! It's no longer the Bridge of Death anymore,' she said.

At
 least some of the money still requires additional approval. The 
bridge's board, however, has now taken its final step in adopting the 
net.

'The tragedy of today is that we can't go
 back in time, we can't save ... the people who jumped off the bridge. 
But the good thing, with this vote today, we can vote in their memory,' 
board member Janet Reilly said. 'We will save many lives who have 
followed in their footsteps and that's what so extraordinary about 
today.'

The Golden Gate Bridge, with its 
sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay, has long been
 a destination for people seeking to end their lives.

Since it opened in
 1937, more than 1,400 people have plunged to their deaths, including a 
record 46 suicides last year, officials said.

Officials
 have been discussing a suicide barrier on the bridge for decades. The 
bridge's board voted in 2008 to install a stainless steel net, rejecting
 other options, including raising the 4-foot-high railings and leaving 
the iconic span unchanged.

Two years later, 
they certified the final environmental impact report for the net, which 
would stretch about 20 feet wide on each side of the span. Officials say
 it will not mar the landmark bridge's appearance.

But funding for the project remained a major obstacle.

A
 significant hurdle was overcome two years ago when President Barack 
Obama signed into law a bill making safety barriers and nets eligible 
for federal funds.

House Minority Leader Nancy
 Pelosi of California in a statement Friday praised the bridge's board 
and Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, D-San Francisco, who has been a staunch 
supporter of a barrier.

The Golden Gate Bridge district's board of directors voted unanimously to approve a $76 million funding package to build a net suicide barrier on the iconic span

'The Golden Gate 
Bridge is a source of immense pride to San Francisco, but for too many 
families in our community, it has also been a place of pain,' Peloisi 
said. 'A suicide prevention barrier offers a critical second chance for 
troubled men and women acting on often impulsive suicidal thoughts. 
Together, we can ensure this magnificent landmark stands as a faithful 
companion for all San Franciscans, awing and inspiring visitors for 
generations to come.'

Most jumpers suffer a 
grisly death, with massive internal injuries, broken bones and skull 
fractures. Some die from internal bleeding. Others drown.

Kevin
 Hines, who miraculously survived his suicide attempt after jumping off 
the structure in 2000 at age 19, urged the board before its vote to "not
 let one more family sit in eternal pain, in perpetuity because of 
politics."

He later broke down after the unanimous vote approving the funding.

'I
 feel like a giant weight has been lifted off my shoulders, all of our 
shoulders. I feel free,' Hines said. 'I feel a sense of hope that I 
haven't had in a very long time. It's not over yet, we will be here 
until that net is raised and no more people die.'

Richard
 Gamboa of Sacramento, whose son, Kyle was among the 46 bridge suicides 
last year, said while Friday's vote is momentous, he's not done 
fighting.

Over 1,500 people committed suicide by jumping from the iconic bridge since it opened in 1937 with 46 people jumping to their death in 2013

'It's not over for me. I'm going to 
keep coming here and urging them to get the barrier done. When I go on 
that bridge and look down and see that net there, then I will be at 
peace,' Gamboa said.

John Brooks, whose 
17-year-old daughter, Casey, jumped from the rust-colored span in 2008, 
told the board Friday that he hopes that some measure is taken before 
the net is constructed to provide some kind of safety to everybody.

'What I really don't want to see between now and the time it is done is more deaths,' Brooks said. 'That will be a cruel irony.'

Board
 members and San Francisco supervisors David Campos and London Breed 
both agreed that the sooner the barrier is built, the better.

'We need to build it as quickly as we can,' Campos said.

Bidding on the job is expected to start next year, with completion of construction expected in 2018.
