Blonde mega model Cara Delevingne has the biggest brows in the business, but today her famous facial furniture was well kept hidden as she hit the catwalk in Milan.

Walking for Italian fashion house Fendi on day one of the city's fashion week the 21-year-old British model strutted down the runway in a tomato-red shift dress and black basin-cut wig.

The unforgiving hairpiece would have swamped lesser models, but Cara worked the beatnik look like a true pro, proof that she really can make anything look good.

Fellow British model Georgia May Jagger was also part of the luxury label's spring/summer show.

The short, sombre wig accentuated her mega pout and drew comparisons between the 21-year-old and her rockstar father Mick Jagger.

Cara recently starred in a short film for Fendi, shot by creative director and industry heavyweight Karl Lagerfeld on the outskirts of Rome.

The spooky seven minute film stars fellow model Saskia de Brauw and fashion muse Amanda Harlech and sees Cara playing the character of a doe-eyed and vulnerable girl - a far cry from her usual funny face antics.

According to Vogue.co.uk Cara's desire to pursue an acting career is no secret - she recently
 landed her first leading role in British film Kids In Love, and also 
played a small part in the most recent cinema adaptation of Anna 
Karenina, alongside Keira Knightley and Aaron Taylor-Johnson.

Spring/summer 2014 was given a sixties spin by Fendi at their Thursday show and model Cara Delevingne was only recognisable by her killer cheekbones as she stalked the runway in a wig and mirrored shades

She arrived in Milan straight from a hectic five days of working and partying at London Fashion Week where the Londoner was the star of Mulberry, Burberry and Topshop catwalk shows and even found time to host her own party along with style
 magazine W.

Cara has been keeping her fans up to date with a constant stream of Twitter and Instagram updates from backstage at the shows.

But
 one subject she has been keeping quiet on is the hot topic of her 
rumoured dalliance with One Direction heartthrob Harry Styles.

The short wigs accentuated Georgia's mega pout and led to comparisons between the model and her rockstar father Mick Jagger

The
 big-haired boyband singer was front row at the Burberry show and seemed
 mesmerised by his model friend as she paraded a selection of pretty 
pastel outfits down the catwalk.

Even being seated between Burberry babes Sienna Miller and Suki Waterhouse couldn't avert his attention.

And
 after the show the cute couple were pictured together backstage as they
 joked around and Cara was snapped with her arm around the singer.

But Styles shrugged off the rumours that they were an item saying: 'People talk about anything really, but we're just friends and stuff. She is a lovely girl.'

The Best Song Ever singer also claimed he had not been partying too much during fashion week and said: 'I haven't had that busy a week. Everyone seems to think I'm out all the time - I'm not.'Â 

That's my girl! Harry Styles only had eyes for Cara Delevingne as she rocked the runway at the Burberry Prorsum spring/summer 2014 show in London's Kensington Gardens on Monday afternoon

After the show Cara - wearing a printed tee by Casson London - stopped to have her picture taken with some Italian fans
