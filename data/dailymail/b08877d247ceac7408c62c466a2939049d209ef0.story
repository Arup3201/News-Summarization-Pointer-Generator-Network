A pensioner was mauled to death after dogs smelled his roast dinner and broke through his garden fence.

Cliff Clarke slightly burnt the lamb shank he was cooking for his evening meal so he opened his back door.

But the smell of the food attracted two large dogs.

Police at the scene removing the dog, that was shot dead by armed police, from the house in Clubmoor

One – a Staffordshire bull terrier 
crossed with a bull mastiff, according to neighbours – jumped at the 
retired hospital porter as he stepped out of his back door.

The dog’s jaws clamped round one of  Mr Clarke’s limbs and dragged him to  the ground where he was bitten a number of times.

Neighbours heard his screams and 
rushed to the three-bedroom terraced house. One of them armed himself 
with a golf club and tried to beat the animal away from the pensioner.

When police arrived, four armed officers shot the dog dead. It took three of them to carry its body away.

Mr Clarke’s next-door neighbours – two women, 27 and 28 – were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter then released on bail pending further inquiries.

Another neighbour Paul McGlynn, 46, said: ‘I heard his screams – it was horrible. He seemed in a lot of pain.

‘The neighbour tried to beat them back but it was too late.’

Joiner Gary Dignan, 36, said: ‘The 
two huge dogs had got out a few hours before and were in people’s 
gardens. One [neighbour] was too frightened to go out but called someone
to report it.’

He added that Mr Clarke walked with a
stick and described him as ‘pretty frail’, adding that he ‘wouldn’t 
have stood a chance against such big dogs’.

The attack, at 9pm on Saturday in the
Clubmoor district of Liverpool, is the second death by dogs in the past
two months. In March, Jade Anderson, 14, was killed by two 
Staffordshire bull terriers and two bull mastiffs at a house in 
Atherton, near Wigan.

Police say they are powerless to prosecute anyone in relation to Jade’s death, because the attack happened on private property.

But when Mr Clarke was killed, he was
on his own property where the dog was not permitted, which constitutes 
an offence under the Dangerous Dogs Act.

Mr Clarke, who joined the Army in 1954 for National Service, had celebrated his 79th birthday the day before the attack.

One friend Susan Carson, 60, who 
lives across the road in the quiet cul-de-sac, said: ‘He came round for a
cup of tea at mine just before he died. He called me afterwards to say 
he had burnt his tea but said, “I’ll be OK”.’

She added: ‘He’s lived in that house 
all his life and told us that he had been born there. It is awful for 
him to die in such a senseless way right in his own garden.’

Police said the dog attacked the pensioner in the garden of his home in Clubmoor, Liverpool, just before 8.40pm last night

She said Mr Clarke had complained about the dogs and was going to report them to the police.
‘He said they could attack somebody and was worried that the  biggest 
dog had been trying to escape and had made a hole in  the fence that it 
could get through,’ she said.

‘Cliff was in a terrible state when 
they brought him out, he was a bloody mess. He was only wearing his 
underwear and one slipper.’

It is not clear whether the second dog was involved in the attack. It was not killed but put on a lead. 
Police were last night questioning the two arrested women on suspicion of manslaughter.
