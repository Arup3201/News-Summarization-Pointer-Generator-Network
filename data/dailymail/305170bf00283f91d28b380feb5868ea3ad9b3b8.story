'Jolly': Two-year-old Kacey Hambleton, pictured, was found unresponsive when police were called to the family home in Blackpool on 10 April this year 

A violent killer who shook his girlfriend's two-year-old daughter with such ferocity that her fatal injuries resembled those of a car crash victim was jailed for nine years today.

Connor Gibson, 23, was said to have had a violent 'flare up' during which he grabbed and battered Kacey Hambleton in an assault which left her crying in pain.

Kacey, who was described as a 'happy, jolly child' was later found unresponsive when police were called to her family home in Blackpool at around 10am on 10 April this year. 

When paramedics arrived, Gibson said that the little girl had slipped in the shower. His lies led to Kacey's mother Louise Hambleton, 23, being wrongly arrested as she waited at her daughter's hospital bedside. 

Miss Hambleton, who was at work when the incident took place, was detained in custody and only released on bail to see her daughter die in her arms, two days after the assault took place.  

Gibson, who has no history of violence towards children, later confessed to carrying out the killing during an 'outburst of anger' but has failed to say why.

Miss Hambleton, from Blackpool, wept as a statement from her was read out condemning Gibson for his betrayal. He admitted manslaughter at Preston Crown Court  earlier this week after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted.

The statement read: 'I left my daughter with someone I could trust not knowing it would be the last time I would see her alive.

'In hospital I saw bruises to Kacey's legs and couldn't understand what was going on and couldn't get anything out of Connor. I just wanted to know what happened.'

She told how she was subsequently arrested and said: 'I remember thinking hurry up and ask me questions let me go. I knew I had not done anything wrong - I was being kept away from Kacey. 

'Why did Connor not tell the truth.. When will I be released from this? I never will.'

Miss Hambleton said that she had wrongly been branded a murderer on social networking sites and asked why Gibson had still not explained why he had done it. 

Kasey's father Russell Hambleton, 27, said: 'The whole family has been left absolutely devastated and heartbroken by Kacey's death. 

'My little princess is gone and I feel like my heart has been ripped out. Kacey was a beautiful little girl with so much to live for; she has been taken from us far too soon.'

At around 9am on the morning of the attack, Gibson, who had been put in charge of Kacey, text Miss Hambleton to tell her that her daughter was still in bed.

Lies: Gibson's claims that Kacey had slipped led to Louise Hambleton being wrongly arrested in connection to the incident as she waited at her daughter's bedside. Above, Gibson with Kacey and Louise Hambleton

Less than an hour later, Gibson called the emergency services and said that the two-year-old had 'slipped' after he put her in the shower. 

According to prosecutor Francis McEntee, Gibson told the operator: 'She's breathing, she's just not responding. I heard a bang, ran in and she was on the floor. She has got like red marks on her near her private parts and stomach. So that might be it.'

Paramedics arrived at 9.57am and there was a 20 second delay before he answered the door with Kacey in his arms. The medics noted that she did not feel wet as if she had been in a shower cubicle.

'Thunp': A CT scan revealed that Gibson, pictured, had left Kacey with bleeding to the surface of the brain and lacerations to the liver

She described by paramedics as 'critically ill' with pale skin, a low level of consciousness and dilated pupils and it was noted she did not feel wet as if she had been in a shower cubicle, the court heard. 

Gibson continued to claim that he had heard a 'thump' after leaving her in the shower and returned to find her unresponsive.

After being taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Blackpool, Kacey was taken by air ambulance to the Alder Hey Children's Hospital with significant bruising to her back, buttocks legs and pelvic area as well as bruising to her face, temple and eye. 

A CT scan showed bleeding to the surface of the brain and lacerations to the liver. 

Mr  McEntee said: 'For some unknown reason the defendant flew into a rage and carried out the fatal attack. He must have spent some minutes inventing a plausible explanation.

He added: 'This was an assault committed on a child by a man over 6ft and particularly heavy built. 

'He was capable of causing significant damage when striking out in anger. The pain and distress would have been immediate and painful.

'It is impossible to conceive that a two-year-old could have caused such a reaction. His intent was an intent just short of that necessary for murder. In striking Kacey he would have instinctively known he would have caused her pain and harm. 

'The injuries would normally be consisting with punching kicking and stamping, throwing against a hard surface. The brain injuries were as a result of a violent shake.'

In mitigation David Fish QC said: 'There must have been a build up of tension and pressure at some stage lost control and assaulted Kacey. The defendant is unclear as to how or why these events unfolded.'

Trusted: Miss Hambleton, pictured with Gibson, left her daughter in her boyfriend's care when she went to work on 10 April this year. Gibson, right, has never explained the reason behind the ferocious assault

Sentencing, Justice Susan Carr told Gibson: 'You subjected Kacey to very severe abuse and it implicated her mother who has suffered significantly as a result. 

'She was detained in custody as her daughter was dying and she feels judged every time she goes out. The court takes this opportunity to record her dignity - neither she nor anyone else is in anyway to blame.

'This was an extreme abuse of trust. You were in sole trust of Kacey and this was a violent assault probably in anger during which you must of caused such terrible pain and such terrible fear. 

'No sentence can be long enough. I think the fact you lost your temper looking after a child it's unforgivable.' 

Innocent: Following the incident, Miss Hambleton, pictured, was wrongly branded a murderer on social networking sites. She said that she went 'numb' when Gibson confessed to beating her daughter
