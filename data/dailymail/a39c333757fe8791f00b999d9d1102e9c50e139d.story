A garage owner who helped to smuggle £37 million worth of heroin into the country in a specially adapted X-type Jaguar has been jailed. 

A quarter of a ton of the drug had been hidden in a series of secret compartments inside the battered old car - which had no ignition or electrics and couldn't be driven - as it arrived at the port of Felixstowe on a container ship from Pakistan. 

Attique Sami, 44, was the third member of a drug smuggling crime gang to be jailed over the plot when he received a sentence of 19 years yesterday. 

A garage owner who helped to smuggle £37 million worth of heroin into the country in a specially adapted X-type Jaguar has been jailed

Scans revealed that a quarter of a ton of the drug had been hidden in a series of secret compartments inside the battered old car - which had no ignition or electrics and couldn't be driven - as it arrived at the port of Felixstowe on a container ship from Pakistan

Heroin was concealed in the bumpers, wheel arches, dashboard, central console, spare wheel compartment, engine and rear seating of the vehicle.

Paperwork with the vehicle made out it had been shipped to the UK to be repaired.

But investigators were able to find the drugs after the Jaguar was scanned with X-ray equipment, and its secret cargo was revealed. 

Attique Sami, 44, was the third member of a drug smuggling crime gang to be jailed over the plot when he received a sentence of 19 years yesterday

Sami of Ilford was found guilty of conspiring to import and supply heroin following a trial at Luton Crown Court. 

His conviction follows the sentencing of two other men, Noman Qureshi, 32, from Bradford, and Israr Khan, 35, from Luton, in October last year.

They were sentenced to 21 and 18 years respectively.

The smugglers did not realise they were already under surveillance by a crack team from the National crime Agency soon after the container ship arrived at the port in Suffolk in December 2013

On the evening of Friday 6 December 2013, Qureshi drove from his home in Bradford, picked up Khan in Luton, and drove to a hotel in Ilford. Sami arrived in his Porsche 911 to meet with them to discuss where to unload the heroin from the car.

The Jaguar, which had been shipped to the UK from Pakistan, was driven on the back of a low-loader to an address in Dagenham during the early hours of 7 December

Qureshi and Khan met it, but shortly after left the scene. They were arrested later that morning in Luton.

The Jaguar was seized and examined by specialist Border Force search officers.

They recovered 316 separate packages of heroin totalling 230 kilos. If cut and sold the drugs would have had a likely potential street value of £37.2 million.

Sami was arrested in February 2014. NCA investigators linked him to a phone that had regularly been used to contact Qureshi prior to the heroin importation.

The Class A drug was packed into the boot (pictured), dashboard, central console and spare wheel compartment. Even the car's engine had been removed to make room for the lucrative haul

National Crime Agency Branch Commander David Norris said: 'Sami played a crucial part in this conspiracy - his role would have been to recover the drugs concealed within the car.

'This group had international contacts and planned to import hundreds of kilos of high-purity heroin to the UK in what was a quite remarkable smuggling attempt. 

'The car in which the drugs were hidden had virtually every spare bit of space filled with heroin.

'But they were unaware their moves were being monitored by NCA investigators, who prevented them from putting these harmful drugs on the streets.'
