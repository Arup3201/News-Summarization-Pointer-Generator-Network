Jodi Arias told the court today that months before she stabbed him to death, she caught her boyfriend Travis Alexander pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys.

That admission came nearly a year after he had given her a packet of boy’s Spiderman underwear for Valentine's Day, saying that he found it 'hot' when she wore them during sex.

Monday was one of the most explosive days of testimony in her ongoing murder trial, as she told the jury in the Phoenix, Arizona courtroom about how she discovered his ‘deviant’ sexual interest a long time after they had started their sexual relationship.

The most gripping moment came when she
recounted how she went over to his house after work on January 21, 2008
and helped him move some boxes up to the attic.

He then gave her a 
porcelain angel figurine, calling her ‘his angel’.

Later after leaving the house, she realized she forgot the figurine and she turned her car around to go back to get it.

When she went back into the house, she
did not see or hear Alexander until she walked into his bedroom and 
found him pleasuring himself on the bed.

‘I got really embarrassed, even though we'd been intimate more times than I can count,’ she told the courtroom.

He then allegedly tried to collect the
pieces of paper that were surrounding him on the bed before she could 
see what they were, but one fell at her feet and she saw that it was a 
picture of a young boy in his underwear.

She did not recognize the boy, and only said that he looked to be about five or six years old.

‘I was frozen there for a minute- 
well, maybe not a whole minute- I didn't know how to react,’ she said, 
going on to say that she ran out of the house and into her car.

Once she arrived home, she rushed to the bathroom and threw up.

But she also claimed that they had sexual 
relations that night because she thought that it would ‘help’ him.

Choked up: Arias told the court that she saw Travis Alexander pleasuring himself while looking at pictures of young boys in their underwear

Throughout the day’s testimony, her 
defense attorney continually asked why various incidents during her 
relationship with Alexander did not prompt her to cut ties with him all 
together.

Since Arias, 32, has claimed that she 
killed the then-30-year-old man in self defense, the attorney is likely 
using her time on the stand to paint a picture of a battered woman who 
felt compelled to return to a complex relationship.

One of those points, addressed earlier in the day, was when she alleged that he had sex with her while she was sleeping.

Another was on February 14, 2007, when
she received a box of Valentine's Day presents from Alexander which 
included chocolates, a T-shirt and panties with his name on it, and a 
packet of Spiderman underwear.

She claimed her later discovery of him with the pictures of young boys helped her understand why he thought it was ‘hot’ for her to wear the children’s 
underwear.

She added that she was forced to alter the
underwear because the leg holes were too tight and that she had been 
'confused' by Alexander's request.

Alexander repeatedly had anal sex with her while she was wearing the children's underwear, Arias said.

Stares: The sisters of victim Travis Alexander have been present each day of trial and have rolled their eyes and looked away as Arias testifies

Disbelief: Travis' sisters and his friend looked incredulous as Arias told the court about his alleged 'deviant' interests

‘He preferred sex with women, it made him feel normal, more normal,’ she told the court.

‘It's hard to describe this. It’s very
embarrassing. He seemed very ashamed with himself and he didn’t want to
be that way it was something he struggled with. It’s not who he wanted 
to be its not who he wanted to be in the future... when he had sex with 
women he felt more normal and it was preferable to his other deviant 
urges, I guess you could say.’

Arias also testified on Monday about 
the first time she had sex with Alexander in May 2007. She said that she
had been asleep and awoke to him having vaginal sex with her.

Throughout the trial, Arias has 
differentiated between vaginal and anal sex, because she believed that 
vaginal sex went against her Mormon vow of chastity before marriage, 
while anal and oral sex qualified as a ‘grey area.’

She said that during the May 2007 
tryst, he forced her to perform oral sex on him but at no point did she 
tell him to stop because 'she loved him.'

Arias also told the packed court room 
that Alexander had a violent temper.

On Monday she specified that he had
been physically violent with her on at least four different occasions, 
either grabbing her wrists or slamming her onto the bed during an 
argument.

Damage: Arias held up her finger to show the courtroom what happened after Alexander allegedly kicked her in the finger and the rib during an altercation

The most extreme of those cases ended with her on the floor as he allegedly kicked her in the ribs and hurt her finger.

She said that rather than seek medical treatment for the finger, which she believes was broken, they made a makeshift splint.

In court, she held up her hand to show how it is scarred bent even today.

‘I would have never called the police 
on Travis,’ she said while talking about the incident when he kicked her
in the ribs and hand.

‘I couldn’t imagine doing something like that.

‘It would have felt like treachery, I wouldn't have betrayed him. I was loyal to him.’

Emotional: Arias wept in court on Monday as she was shown photographs of her with Alexander on trips and at parties

Earlier in the day, she said that 
their relationship showed strains in the beginning, as she confronted 
him after finding text messages from other women just a few months after
they began dating.

Several months later in 2007, Arias 
moved to Mesa and although the couple remained broken up, they continued
to have a clandestine relationship.  

Around this time, Alexander paid Arias
to clean his house because she had money troubles. She claimed he 
wanted sex while she cleaned and would suggest she wear a French maid's 
costume.

The murder suspect also described the fantasies that Alexander would act out upon her.

She told the jury on Monday that on 
several occasions, he drove up to her house and ejaculated on her face 
while she was on the porch of her home. She said that on one occasion, 
he threw a Toblerone candy bar at her after he did so.

Anger: Taylor Searle (pictured right), a friend of murder victim Travis Alexander, has said that she believes Arias is lying on the stand

'I couldn't help feeling I was kind of like a prostitute,' she added. 'But I chalked it up to one of his little antics.'

She said that around this time, the number of their sexual 'antics' increased. Arias also said that during their casual relationship, they had sex on the freeway while he was driving.

Travis Alexander's sisters sat in the front row of the gallery today and glared at Arias on the stand throughout her testimony, repeatedly rolling their eyes when she made allegations against their dead brother.

Arias's mother was in court today as she has been throughout the lengthy trial along with her father who was sitting in for the first time. Jodi's brother Joseph was also seen but appeared to have left the room during his sister's testimony.

Friends of murder victim Travis Alexander have spoken of their anguish following Arias' testimony last week.

A close friend of the late Mr Alexander, Taylor Searle, told RadarOnline:
'She is scary because you know she is lying about something, but you 
almost think she believes her own lies because she is selling it so 
effectively.'

Ms Searle added: 'He
always told me she was a nymphomaniac and super sex-crazed, so I am 
assuming what ever happened it wasn’t all him – but that is assuming 
what she says actually happened!'

Arias and her defense team have sought to paint Alexander as a manipulative and controlling sexual deviant.

Arias admits she killed Alexander, whom she had dated for about five months in 2007, at his Mesa home in June 2008.

The prosecution claims she carried out a pre-planned attack as she was jealous of his relationships with other women.

Happier times: Arias is accused of stabbing and shooting Travis Alexander in his Mesa home in 2008

She initially claimed she had nothing to do with the attack, before changing her story to say she watched two people kill Alexander before finally settling on self defense.

She told the court last week how she was abused by her parents as a child, and how Alexander failed to acknowledge their relationship or touch her in public.

She claimed that behind closed doors it was the opposite; despite his position as a Mormon elder who baptized her, he forced her into unwanted anal sex, claiming that vaginal sex was 'not allowed'.

After the incident and other earlier 
unwanted sexual encounters, she felt 'kind of stupid', 'bummed out' and 
'like a prostitute, sort of'.

If she is convicted, she faces the death penalty.
