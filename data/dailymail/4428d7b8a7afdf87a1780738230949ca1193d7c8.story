A man who claimed he was robbed at gunpoint, kidnapped and held against his will for three days was actually an escaped convict, police have revealed.

Jasmond Stepney, 33, asked to meet with officers at the Capital Health Regional Medical Center in Trenton, New Jersey, on Sunday and described the apparent ordeal. 

But he was soon taken into custody and turned over to state corrections officials after it was revealed he had absconded from Clinton House and failed to return. 

Convict: Jason Stepney, 33, (mugshot taken in 2011) told officers that he had been kidnapped at gunpoint and held against his will for three days, but he had actually escaped from a halfway house in Trenton (right) 

According to the New Jersey Department Of Corrections, he had been serving a four-year sentence for burglary and was eligible for parole.

He has now been taken back into custody at Garden State Correctional Facility and is expected to face escape charges.

In 2011, Stepney was wanted for trying to hide from a parole officer and failing to show up to court.

In 2012, a Nasson Harrington, 24, walked away from Clinton House without permission and returned the morning after. 

He was still taken into custody at Garden State Correctional facility and charged with escape. 

Crime: According to the New Jersey Department Of Corrections, Stepney had been serving a four-year sentence for burglary and was eligible for parole

Back behind bars: He is now in custody at the Garden State Youth Correctional Facility in New Jersey and is expected to face escape charges 

The website states that Clinton House is a 'work release program designated for male residents'. 

The description adds: 'The program provides individual counseling and employment assistance leading to work release. Community service at this facility is mandatory. Residents may also participate in treatment programs. 

'Group counseling is also provided to residents to help focus on developing group responsibility, communication skills and respect for individual differences in life styles.'
