These rare colour photographs of Adolf Hitler spent a decade languishing beneath the ground.

His personal photographer Hugo Jaeger - who was granted unprecedented access to the Führer to document his every move between 1936 and 1945 - hid his colour slides after the fall of Nazi Germany for fear of being persecuted.

Jaeger, who was one of the first photographers to use colour film before the end of the war years, buried the slides in metal jars to try and conceal his links to the Nazis, but returned to retrieve his handiwork in 1955.

The collection, published by Life.com, includes informal photographs of the Nazi leader dining with members of his inner circle, as well as shots of him delivering speeches against the backdrop of a swastika flag or overseeing battle plans.

Jaeger shot thousands of photographs of Hitler over a period of nine years, before the end of the war prompted to hide his colour slides in a leather case - terrified they would give away his links to the Nazis.

U.S. soldiers did come across the 
stash while searching the photographer's house in Munich, but they 
discarded the pack of slides, making off instead with a bottle of 
brandy, the Huffington Post said.

Rattled, Jaeger hid the slides again - this time in metal jars which he buried.

A decade later he returned to retrieve the chilling archive.
