A kayak fisherman from Washington died on Monday off the coast of Maui after a shark bit off his dangling foot officials on the Hawaiian island said today.

Police identified the kayaker as Patrick A. Briney, 57 of Stevenson, who was kayaking with a friend from Makena Landing towards Big Beach when he was attacked around 9 a.m.

Police say Briney began to scream, 'which caught the attention of his 
friend' who found him with severe bleeding from his right leg and one witness reported that the victim's leg 'was all bone with the foot off.

Desperately trying to stem the bleeding his fishing partner tied a tourniquet on Brineyand sought help from a nearby charter tour boat.

The boat took them to shore, and Briney was then taken to a hospital, the state said. It's unclear when he was pronounced dead.

Tthe kind of shark involved in the attack has not been identified or confirmed yet.

Though the attack happened far from shore, the state advised the public to stay out of the water a mile north and a mile south of Makena State Recreation Area in southwest Maui.

'Maui County Ocean Safety officers received a report around 10:20 a.m. 
that said the male victim was fishing in his kayak somewhere between 
Maui and Molokini when he was bitten by a shark,' said county officials 
in a press release issued following the incident.

There have been eight shark attacks near Maui this year and 13 statewide. On Friday, a woman suffered nonfatal injuries in a Maui attack.

'We are not sure why these bites are occurring more frequently than normal, especially around Maui,' said department Chairman William Aila Jr.

'That's why we are conducting a two-year study of shark behavior around Maui that may give us better insights.'

Warnings: County and state officials have closed beaches from Makena Landing to the surf area known as 'Dumps' until noon Tuesday. The waters off Makena State Recreational Area have been closed as well

Over the last 20 years, Hawaii has averaged about four unprovoked shark incidents per year, the state said.

In August, a German tourist died a week after losing her arm in a shark attack. Jana Lutteropp, 20, was snorkeling up to 100 yards off a beach in southwest Maui when the shark bit off her right arm.

Before Lutteropp's death, the last shark attack fatality in Hawaii was in 2004, when a tiger shark bit Willis McInnis' leg while he was surfing in Maui.

Isaac Brumaghim knows firsthand the dangers of kayak fishing, which he said is growing in popularity. He was fishing off Oahu's west coast in April when a camera mounted on his kayak captured footage of a 9-foot shark jumping up and chomping on the tuna he was reeling in.

Sharks are 'an absolute danger, every single day,' he said. 'You have to respect the fact they can bite you at any time.'

He said bait in the water can easily attract the animal.

'Just a little bit of blood, a little meat in the water, that's all you need,' he said. 'It's like dogs out there.'
