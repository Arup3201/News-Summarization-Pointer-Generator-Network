Overhaul: Education Secretary Michael Gove will outline a radical overhaul of GCSEs which will do away with low pass marks and force pupils to take extension papers to get the best grades

Education Secretary Michael Gove today abandoned his ambitious plans to scrap GCSEs, admitting his radical reforms were a 'bridge too far.

He instead unveiled an overhaul of the existing exam system, doing away with low pass marks and forcing pupils to take extension papers to get the best grades.

The tougher GCSEs will involve single, harder exams at the end of two years of studying, replacing modules at the end of almost every term.

But he said the idea of axing GCSEs in favour of new English Baccalaureate Certificates in core academic subjects was 'one reform too many at this time'.

And a plan to only allow a single exam board per subject has been dumped, despite previously arguing it was essential to prevent boards 'dumbing down' standards to get more business from schools.

Mr Gove told MPs in the Commons: 'I have decided not to make the best the enemy of the good.' He originally wanted to introduce EBCs in England in English, maths, science, foreign languages, history and geography.

But the Liberal Democrats opposed the idea of a 'two tier' exam system and imposing rules on exam boards risked falling foul of EU law.

Government lawyers advised that the plan would have been allowed in a few subjects – but setting up monopolies across the board would have led to exam boards suing the Government if they were put out of business.

Labour;s Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, said: 'The words "GCSE" and "fiasco" seem to be indelibly linked under this Government. This is a humiliating climbdown.'

The Mail revealed last year that Mr Gove planned to abolish GCSES and bring back O-levels in core subjects along with a practical CSE-style exam.

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who had not been briefed on the plans, demanded that all pupils should sit the same exam.

He said he did not like the original plan, which he described as 'a two-tier system where you tell one set of kids you are not bright enough to proceed'.

And he praised Mr Gove for changing his plans after a consultation. 'He's quite rightly listened and he's going to make a statement today which I think will show parents and teachers that we are as ambitious as ever as a coalition Government for higher, better standards.

'But at the same time to make sure the approach is broad-based, not too narrow, so it encompasses lots of subjects and not just a narrow focus on some of them, and also doesn't already reinvent the wheel,' he said on his LBC radio phone-in.

Intervention: Mr Gove planned to abolish GCSES and bring back O-levels in core subjects along with a practical CSE-style exam but Lib Dem intervention scuppered the plans

A deal was thrashed out last autumn that would have seen new exams in English, maths and other core subjects.

But Mr Gove and his Lib Dem deputy David Laws abandoned the plans after deciding they were an unworkable compromise.

Instead,
 Mr Gove will today publish a national curriculum for pupils at 16 and 
use a statement to the Commons to outline plans to improve GCSEs.

Under his proposals, GCSE pass marks –
 which can be as low as 30 per cent in some subjects – will be raised so
 they are based on the level of knowledge pupils in other countries are 
expected to achieve.

GCSEs will also have fewer 
‘bite-sized’ questions – blamed for grade inflation – proper essays in 
English and history, fewer resits and more restrictions on texts in 
exams.

Nick Clegg said he had blocked a 'two tier' exam system

Extension papers will also be introduced for pupils expected to achieve top grades, particularly in maths and the sciences.

Mr
 Gove will issue instructions to exam watchdog Ofqual today and they 
will draw up the tougher GCSEs, which will begin for pupils starting 
their studies in September 2015.

They
 will sit the exams in 2017 – one year earlier than planned. Mr Gove is 
also tearing up rules for judging success in schools to ensure that 
teachers are forced to help pupils of all abilities.

Insiders
 say the current system of judging how many pupils get five GCSEs graded
 A* to C, including English and maths, encourages schools to make 
students sit ‘junk’ exams in easy subjects to boost grades.

In
 future, schools will be judged on the percentage of pupils passing 
English and maths and a points system for a pupil’s best eight results –
 which must include at least three core subjects such as science, 
history, geography and languages.

The rethink came after the Commons Education Committee said standards could be raised by improving GCSEs rather than scrapping them.

A source close to the committee said: ‘We said that we weren’t convinced that the GCSE brand was broken.

‘It was right to say that exams at 16 needed reform, with a crackdown on resits but you can send a message about grade inflation without coupling exam reform with market reform. I’m glad it seems they have listened.’

Former schools minister Nick Gibb insisted Mr Gove had 'taken the right decision'.

'There is a determination for an aged-16 qualification, the GCSE will be rigorous, it will be on a par with the best in the world,' he told BBC Radio 4.

'There's agreement right across the political spectrum - Labour, Liberal, Conservatives - that there has been grade inflation over the years in the GCSEs and one of the reasons for that has been the competition between exam boards for a market share of scores.

'The plan now is for Ofqual to be rigorous in ensuring we don't have that grade inflation and of course this thing will be kept under review.

'And if the exams board don't reform the way they conduct themselves and start to maintain standards from year-to-year and against the international competition - that's the new objective that Ofqual has, they will now be looking around the world at the best exams and comparing those with the qualifications we have in this country.'
