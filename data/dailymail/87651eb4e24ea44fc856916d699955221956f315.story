It is where Prince Charles  conducted his illicit affair with Camilla Parker Bowles.

Now Anmer Hall in Norfolk is reportedly being lined up as a  country home for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Despite the obvious poignancy that Prince William will know it was a place where his father betrayed his mother, the Queen is said to be ready to gift the property to him and Catherine as they prepare to welcome their first child.

The late-Georgian country house is just two miles east of the Queen’s  Sandringham House, where the Royals celebrate Christmas.

The Duke spent many of his childhood holidays exploring the ten-bedroom Grade II-listed property and its grounds, which have been part of the Sandringham estate since 1898, and is said to have fond memories of it.

However, it was also one of the country houses where Charles and Camilla used to enjoy secret trysts, when the Prince of Wales’s friend Hugh van Cutsem rented  the property.

It was claimed yesterday that Anmer Hall has been ‘earmarked for William and Kate’, and was described as a perfect country bolt-hole in the picturesque village of Anmer.

However, it is unlikely the couple would be able to enjoy it for another four years, when their son or daughter would be three years old.

Anmer Hall, which was lived in by the Duke and Duchess of Kent between 1972 and 1990, is leased until March 2017 to James Everett, who owns a kitchen and timber company.

He moved into the property in 2000, but would not comment on whether he planned to stay.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, currently living in a rented farmhouse on Anglesey, are also waiting for renovation work on their London home in Kensington Palace to be completed.

When they are not on Anglesey, they live at Nottingham Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace in West London, which has just one bedroom and has been described as ‘cosy’.

However, later this year they will move into the newly  renovated Apartment 1A inside the palace itself, which was Princess Margaret’s home, while Prince Harry will have the cottage.

The new apartment will suit the couple’s growing family, as it boasts five bedrooms and three reception rooms.

Renovation work is being paid for out of the public purse, although the Royals are covering the cost of the interior design.

Last year it emerged that the Queen was planning to give her grandson one of the cottages on the Sandringham estate to mark his 30th birthday.

She owns around 150 properties on the estate but it is not known which cottage was chosen.

The Duke is thought to be particularly pleased about the Norfolk cottage because he and Kate spent their first Christmas as husband and wife at Sandringham in 2011.

This year they spent Christmas at Kate’s family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire.

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh stay in the main house, an Edwardian mansion, every Christmas with the rest of the Royal Family.

The 20,000-acre Sandringham Estate, near King’s Lynn in Norfolk, has been owned by the Queen since her accession in 1952 and by the Royal Family since 1862.

Although much of the land  is open to the public, the paparazzi are no longer allowed to photograph the Royal family relaxing there.

Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

William has always enjoyed close ties with the Sandringham estate.

His close friends the Van Cutsem family used to live at Anmer Hall and the Prince regularly stayed there as a young boy.

Anmer Hall was bought by the Royal Family in 1862 and was lived in by the Duke and Duchess of Kent between 1972 and 1990.

It is considered  one of the Queen’s most charming properties and sits at the end of a gravel drive close to Anmer Church

The village of Anmer lies between King’s Lynn and Hunstanton, on the edge of the Sandringham estate.

Previously most of the houses were occupied by people who worked at Anmer Hall or in other parts of the Royal estate.

The name Anmer is thought to derive from the Old English meaning 'duck pond'.
