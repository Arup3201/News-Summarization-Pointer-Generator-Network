Jamie Ward produced a sparkling return to action with a double that propelled Derby onto the coat-tails of the Championship play-off places.

Ward, who missed the weekend draw with Nottingham Forest with a hamstring niggle, helped Steve McClaren’s team overcome a frenetic opening to record their first away win in the league this season.

They fell behind with just 51 seconds on the clock when Blackburn’s Ben Marshall scored his third goal at Ewood Park inside a week, following a brace in the 3-1 Lancashire derby win over Wigan.

Such had been the tempo of Blackburn’s start, in fact, that Marshall had already pinged one effort over the top when he sized up a second shot and watched it loop fortuitously over Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant via two deflections.

Undeterred, Derby trailed for just seven minutes courtesy of another slice of fortune. Slipped into space by Simon Dawkins’ slick pass, Craig Bryson shanked his shot but the ball arrived at the back post off a Blackburn boot and Ward celebrated his return from injury by dispatching it into the roof of the net.

With the free-running Dawkins as the catalyst for many, McClaren’s team’s attacks were swift and incisive. Indeed, they might have been ahead before the quarter hour only for Bryson to fire over when well placed.

But they did turn the contest on its head eight minutes before the break when Will Hughes got off the mark for the season with an exquisite finish, a curling effort with his left foot from the edge of the area.

And it could have been an even greater margin separating the teams at the interval but Hughes’ dink from the dead-ball line was volleyed waywardly over by Chris Martin.

The two-goal advantage was forthcoming before the hour, however, as Ward converted a controversial second.

Blackburn were left fuming at referee David Webb after Ward appeared to barge Craig Conway over before haring down on goal. The Northern Ireland international weaved his way into the area, manufactured the space to clip around Paul Robinson with a step-over and duly did so with his left foot.

Unlike many opponents of pre-season promotion fancies Derby, who have taken a defensive approach to muzzle their creative hub in midfield, Rovers manager Gary Bowyer plumped for adventure, sticking with the same personnel and 4-4-2 formation that overwhelmed Wigan. Conversely, it meant they had the firepower to hit back.

When Jordan Rhodes is involved goals can come from nothing but it was his less prolific strike partner Rudy Gestede that gave the hosts a lifeline a dozen minutes from time.

Taking a throw-in on his knee, the Frenchman produced an instinctive near-post finish through the legs of Grant.

Moments later Grant – roundly booed for his Burnley past – was forced to tip over a Tom Cairney 25-yard drive at full stretch and Blackburn’s high octane finish also witnessed Gestede’s downward header in injury strike the crossbar. But try as they might they could not muster the equalizer that would have preserved their unbeaten home record.
