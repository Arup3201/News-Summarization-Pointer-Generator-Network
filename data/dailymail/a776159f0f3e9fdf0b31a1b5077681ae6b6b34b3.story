An investigation has been launched following claims a private primary school in the United Arab Emirates held 15 of its pupils hostage until their parents paid their fees.  

The children, who are pupils at Nibras Al Iman School, in Sharjah and are seven and eight years old, will give evidence to a three member committee next Monday at a hearing which is expected to take two days.

The school's principal will be interviewed as well as the teacher who was with the pupils in the classroom at the time and an administrative member of staff who called the parents to tell them their children were being kept, an official at the Sharjah Educational Zone said.

The alleged incident came to light after the mother of a girl being held called a radio station in Sharjah and told them what had happened. 

She said she was not allowed to take her daughter home until she had paid the school fees which were late. 

The committee investigating the allegations will be made up of two education zone officials and one person from the legal affairs section.

This is not the first time allegations have been made about a school punishing children whose parents have not their paid fees. 

A Palestinian mother accused a school in  Sharjah of banning her son from getting the school bus unless his fees were paid. 

'It’s embarrassing to the child. I know some parents can’t care less sometimes but this is no excuse for scarring a child’s emotions'

Meanwhile a Jordanian mother Mariama Saleem told The National that her son, 10, said a member of staff goes into each class and reads the names aloud of all the children who parents have not paid.

She said: 'It’s embarrassing to the child. I know some parents can’t care less sometimes but this is no excuse for scarring a child’s emotions.'

This week a government school in Ajman withheld exam results of 10 of its pupils and sent text messages to parents to pay the late fees if they wanted to see their children's results.  

Schools are allowed to withhold results, keep official documents needed for pupils to move schools or temporarily suspend the child if parents have been warned three or more times, according to article 52 of the federal law. 

Lawyer Salem Sahoh has said that parents of the 15 children could report the school to the police for 'limiting one's freedom' and 'endangering another's life' 

If the school was found guilty a fine could be imposed and each parent could claim compensation in a civil court. 

Sheikha Deemas, the principal of Sharjah British International School, said the value of bounced cheques received by her school from parents amounts to half a million dirhams.
