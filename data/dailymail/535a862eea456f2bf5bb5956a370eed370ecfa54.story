As Real Madrid stepped to within touching distance of an elusive tenth European Cup following their 4-0 destruction of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, two former Tottenham stars played their part.

Defender Sergio Ramos may have embarrassed Real's expensively assembled array of forwards with two superbly taken headed goals before Cristiano Ronaldo set a Champions League record of 16 goals (and counting) this season - but Bale and Modric's contribution cannot be overlooked.

Although the Welshman may be the world's most expensive player and went some way to attaining cult status with his winning goal in the Copa del Rey final, Modric is still regarded with more affection by the Madrid faithful - his is one of the few names chanted at the Bernabeu.

Will Real Madrid win the Champions League final?

And, while Bale had missed a glorious opportunity to score the opener after Bayern goalkeeper found himself horribly out of position on five minutes, it was Modric who made his presence felt for the first goal.

The Croatian's perfectly whipped corner was met with a bullet header from Ramos to ease Spanish nerves after only 16minutes and Carlo Ancelotti's side rarely looked back, despite conceding the lion's share of possession to the Germans.

Not to be outdone, Bale was instrumental in real's third goal when he turned on the after-burners to speed through the centre of Bayern's midfield before sliding a pass to his teammate and general object of affection Ronaldo to slot home.

While Bale was largely used as a left-sided winger, before his talent took him to a more central position, at White Hart Lane - he was predominantly employed on the right flank against Bayern Munich.

This was no doubt to accommodate Ronaldo's preferred method of cutting in from the opposite side, but Bale stuck diligently to his task and controlled the right side of the pitch while also using his energy to track back in defence.

Heat Map: Luka Modric

Meanwhile, Luka Modric played in a deep lying playmaking position that will be familiar to most Spurs fans. In a similar way that Steven Gerrard has been dictating the play for Liverpool this season, Modric was able to orchestrate events without his relative lack of pace being a hindrance.

And, as this heat map shows, he was able to station himself at the heart of Real's midfield while occasionally finding space in important forward areas with his intelligent movement.

Pass masters: Pep Guardiola's Bayern dominated possession against Real's counter-attacking side

Hoof it: Bayern hot more than twice as many passes - whereas the Spaniards played more long balls

In terms of general play, the newly crowned Champions League favourites managed to complete a four-goal rout away from home despite having only 30.7 per cent of possession against a Bayern side educated by Pep Guardiola.

Bayern made 656 passes, more than twice as many as Ronaldo and Co's 287 - and showed more accuracy than their Spanish counterparts.

Madrid did hit more long passes, an obvious reflection of Real's counter attacking tendencies learned under Jose Mourinho, but while Bayern had more total shots (19 compared to 13) and corners (nine compared to three) than their opponents - they still failed to register a single goal on the scoresheet.

Real's defence obviously played an important part, but the likes of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery were wasteful too - with a shooting accuracy of only 36.4 per cent.

Shooting blanks: Bayern led the way in terms of total shots but Real's four goals are the only attacking statistics that matter
