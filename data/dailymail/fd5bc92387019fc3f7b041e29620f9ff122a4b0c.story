Wayne Rooney and Gary Cahill made good use of their day off as the England duo opted to visit one of Miami's plush golf courses.Â 

Roy Hodgson let the squad relax after their 2-2 draw with Ecuador in their penultimate pre-World Cup friendly, which saw Raheem Sterling sent off for an altercation with Antonio Valencia.

Liverpool's Jon Flanagan joined Manchester United's Rooney and Chelsea's Cahill for the 'cool down day' to try their hand at golf ahead of Saturday night's final friendly against Honduras.
