It must require nerves of steel to drive a £1.6million one-off porcelain supercar through Paris’ notoriously congested streets, let alone parallel park it.

The super-wealthy owner of this astonishing Veyron L'Or Blanc - or White Gold - must have breathed a sigh of relief when it arrived at the hotel unscathed.

This unique edition of the 253mph, 1,000bhp car - created in conjunction with a firm that usually makes tea pots - had never been seen on the road in Europe.

Exclusive: The 253mph car, which is the worlds first car to 'wear the finest porcelain on its body', arrived at the Plaza Athenee Hotel, and soon drew a crowd of onlookers

High-octane: With a price tag of £1.6, and with a porcelain body, it takes calm nerves to parallel park the Veyron in Paris' narrow streets

And when rumours started circling it had popped up in Paris, the 'car-parazzi' packed their 
tripods before heading for France.

Fans from England, France, Holland and
 Germany quickly arrived at the Plaza Athenee Hotel where they found the
 world's first car to ‘wear the finest porcelain on its body’.

Tim Burton, 24, drove down from London after hearing the rumours. He said: ‘I heard the one-off Veyron 
had been seen in Paris and I couldn't miss the opportunity to head to 
France and see it with my own eyes.

‘Fortunately it was parked out on the road and what an amazing car it truly is.’

One-off: The astonishing porcelain Bugatti Veyron L'Or Blanc was made last year but it has never been seen on the road in Europe until now

Drawing a crowd: Fans from England, France, Holland and Germany quickly arrived at the Plaza Athenee Hotel where they found the world's first car to 'wear the finest porcelain on its body'

He was joined by a group who travelled
 from Dusseldorf, Germany while Dutchman Seger Giesbers, 18, said there 
were ‘at least’ 15 photographers at the scene when he arrived.

The £1.6 million L'or Blanc edition of the Veyron Super Sport model was
 built by Bugatti with help from a German ceramics company better 
known for making high-end tea sets.

As well as its swirly porcelain white and blue paint work, its exterior features filler caps, badges and wheel caps made from specially constructed from the material.

Bugatti's design experts came with the
 psychedelic blue and white paintjob as a tribute to the 'Stelvio Pass',
 a legendary stretch of road in Italy.

The supercar firm even went as far as 
describing the creation as an ‘unusual idea’, with the one-off vehicle 
sold to a super-wealthy Saudi Arabian customer.

It is powered by an 8-litre W16 engine
 which develops a mammoth 1,000bhp.

With this power it can accelerate 
from 0-62mph in 2.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 253mph.

Dr. Stefan Brungs, Director of Sales and Marketing at Bugatti Automobiles said at the time of the car's launch in, last year: 'At first, it seems to be an unusual idea to use porcelain in a car, especially in the world's fastest convertible.

'But this is what Bugatti stands for: the realization of exceptional ideas whilst striving for the utmost in quality and aesthetics.

This allows us to continue Ettore Bugatti's heritage, who himself loved to experiment with new materials.'
