An Orthodox Jewish woman has finally won her freedom after a two-year battle for religious divorce from her husband.

Gital Dodelson has been granted a 'get' by her ex-husband Avrohom Meir Weiss, after the pair legally divorced in 2012.

Three months ago the 25-year-old opened up about her struggle to untangle herself from her ex-husband, who exerted his control over her by manipulating Jewish law.

Gital Dodelson, 25, divorced her husband Avrohom Meir Weiss in 2012. After a four-year battle to be granted a 'get' -  the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by Jewish law, she has finally won her freedom

The law student, who lives in Lakewood, New Jersey, told the New York Post she divorced Mr Weiss in 2012, but spent years trying to get him to grant her the 'get' - a document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognised by Jewish law.

Without the document, she was seen as an agunah - a chained woman - in the eyes of the Orthodox community, who considered her still married to Mr Weiss.

The mother-of-one from Lakewood, New 
Jersey, explained that her husband - whom she said has always been a 
controlling man - comes from a respected rabbinic family, making it all 
the more difficult to loosen herself from his power.

After
 numerous attempts to reach an agreement, all met with the same 
defiance, Ms Dodelson has decided to make her story public in an effort 
to move on with her life.

She
 says she saw signs that Mr Weiss would be a difficult husband just 
three days into their marriage in 2009, when they spent their first 
Shabbat together in complete silence.

Explaining 
that the observance is typically a female tradition, she says he lost 
his temper when she was telling him how it was done in her family.

'When my way contradicted his way, he criticized me and turned angry,' she wrote.

Her husband then told her: 'You have 
no choice. It's not my way' - an attitude he was to exhibit consistently
 over the following four years.

The couple separated within a year of getting married, prompting a bitter battle between their Orthodox families, with Weiss reportedly demanding upwards of $350,000 to settle the matter.

Miss Dodelson told the Post, in November: 'On my last mission to ask for a get, a 
month ago, Avrohom said, "I can’t give you a get — how else would I 
control you?"

'I think that’s the key to it all. He insists the marriage 
isn’t over until he says it’s over.'

A
 Facebook group Free Gital: Tell Avrohom Meir Weiss to Give His Wife a 
'Get' was set up, attracting more than 14,000 supporters across the 
world.

Miss Dodelson's publicist, Shira Dicker, said she could not say why Weiss had changed his mind.

The Weiss family, when approached for comment, declined.

Miss
 Dicker said Miss Dodelson and her family have vowed to set up a 
not-for-profit organisation to help other women facing similar problems 
win their freedom.

Refusing to grant a get is viewed in Jewish law as domestic abuse, but Mr Weiss had said he would sign only if she rearranged the custody arrangement and gave him $350,000

She added: 'The family isn't just skipping into the sunset. There's a real sense of responsibility here.'

Mr Weiss not only took control when it came to religious observances, but also when it came to the couple's finances, despite his wife being the sole breadwinner.

When she suggested couples therapy, he refused, and every attempt to communicate was met with silence and hostility.

It was when she became pregnant that she decided to take a stand against her overbearing other half. 

'I thought: "How can I bring a child into this world with a virtual stranger? Someone I'm so disconnected from?"' she said.

Mr Weiss ultimately granted her a divorce - after first attempting to file for sole custody of their son Aryeh.

He repeatedly refused to give her a get, something which in Jewish law is viewed as domestic abuse.

As a man he was free to date other women, while his ex-wife was stuck in limbo in a community where her moving on would have been classed as adultery.

Without a get, she was still seen as married in her community, and would be ostracised if she were to move on romantically
