It's been over 10 years since Yowie chocolates were seen on Australian shelves but the chocolates are being relaunched in America then heading back to Australia in 2019.

The Yowie characters were created by best-selling authors Bryce Courtenay and Geoff Pike in the early 1900s. The illustrations are the work of Australian artist Ted Blackall.

They each contained a toy and a message or story about keeping the environment clean.The Yowie mission statement is: ‘Save the natural world'.

Yowie chocolates were created by best-selling author Bryce Courtenay. The rights to the chocolates have been sold to a new company and are going to be sold in the U.S.

Chocolate-lovers rejoice: Yowie chocolates will be back on Australian shelves in 2019  

Launched by Cadbury in 1995, Yowie sold 65 million units in Australia in its first year, before making the leap into the Asia-Pacific.

However it was a disagreement between Cadbury with Courtenay and Pike over the rights to sell the chocolates in America that led to the pull of the product from shelves.

Yowie Group chairman Wayne Loxton told ABC News  that Yowie was a smash hit and 'one of Cadbury's most successful brands ever launched in the history of the company'.

The characters are based on the mythology surrounding the Australian Yowie which features in indigenous dream time stories.

Yowie outsold their biggest competitor, Kinder Surprise, "taking 30 per cent of the $80 million children's confectionery market", Foster Stockbroking's Haris Khaliqi told ABC News.

Kinder Surprise is not approved for sale in the US markets as authorities have deemed its small toy a choking hazard. Unlike Kinder Surprise chocolates Yowie usually contains a small Australian or New Zealand native animal toy.

The Yowie mission statement is 'Save the natural world' and each contains messages and stories about how the Yowies protect their natural environment.

The Yowie brand also included short stories written by Bryce Courtenay and Geoff Pike and were illustrated by Ted Backall.

Yowie though, has received the only patent given by the US Food and Drug Administration for a chocolate-encased toy.

'If distributing with the right retailers - it could get to the stage where there is potential to build a brand around it as well with ancillary products, merchandise and licensing,' Mr Khaliqi said.

Yowie Group plans on relaunching the chocolates in the Australian market in 2019.
