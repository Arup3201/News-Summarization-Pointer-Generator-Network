Dr Craig Spencer lied to police about travelling around New York for six days before he was quarantined with Ebola, it has been claimed

The doctor currently being treated for Ebola in New York lied to police about travelling around the city for six days before he was quarantined, it has been revealed.

Dr Craig Spencer initially told officers that he had isolated himself in his Harlem apartment after returning from Guinea where he had been treating people for the illness.

It was only when cops checked his MetroCard and bank statement that they realised he had been roaming the city for nearly a week, visiting a sandwich shop, taking an Uber cab, and going bowling.

It was only when officers rang Dr Spencer and confronted him with the evidence that he confessed, according to the New York Post.

Dr Spencer is a Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontiers) volunteer who went to Guinea to help fight Ebola on September 16.

He spent a month working in treatment centres in close contact with sufferers, before flying to Brussels on October 14. After a three-day layover, he landed at JFK Airport on October 17.

He was screened for Ebola on arrival, but reported no symptoms and tests did not detect a trace of the deadly virus.

On October 21 he first reported feeling fatigued, but as he had no fever, vomiting, or diarrhea, he carried on with life as normal.

Over the next two days he rode the A and L train, visited The Meatball Shop restaurant, went running, played a game of bowling at The Gutter alley, and rode around in an Uber cab.

It was only on October 23 that he began to feel feverish, at which point he called Medecins Sans Frontiers who informed the New York Health Department. He was immediately quarantined.

He returned to New York on October 17 and reported feeling fatigued, but it was not until October 23 when he began feeling feverish that he was put in isolation at Bellevue Hospital (pictured)

Yesterday Bellevue Hospital, where he is being treated, reported that he is in a 'serious but stable' condition after being given blood from Ebola survivor Nancy Writebol.

New York health and hospitals corporation president Dr. Ram Raju said: 'This morning I talked to our patient and his doctors and nurses at Bellevue Hospital Center.

'The patient looks better than he looked yesterday, but he remains in serious but stable condition with the expected symptoms of the virus.

'He tolerated the plasma treatment well and had a good night sleep.'

On Friday night, the 33-year-old received a blood donation from aid worker Nancy Writebol, who survived the virus, after tests found they shared the same blood type.

It is a move that medics believe could save his life after Ebola survivors Nina Pham, Amber Jay Vinson, Ashoka Mukpo and Dr Nick Sacra were all cured following blood transfusions.

During the six days in which Dr Spencer roamed around the city, he rode the subway, used an Uber taxi, and visited this restaurant - but initially lied and told police he had stayed at home, it has been reported

The day before Dr Spencer was isolated with Ebola, he visited The Gutter bowling alley (pictured)

Writebol contracted Ebola while working with Christian aid group SIM in Liberia with her husband, who is also a missionary.

They were working with their close friend Dr Kent Brantley, who also contracted the disease and was later cured.

Symptoms of Ebola include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said.

Even if a person is infected, the virus can only be passed on once symptoms appear. It is transmitted through direct contact with the infected person's bodily fluids.

Dr Spencer initially told authorities he had isolated himself in this apartment on 546 West 147th Street in Manhattan, which he shares with fiancee Morgan Dixon

After Dr Spencer was quarantined, Hazmat teams visited his apartment with barrels in order to take away potentially infected items
