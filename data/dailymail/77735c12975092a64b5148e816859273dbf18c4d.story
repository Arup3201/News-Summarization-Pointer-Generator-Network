The blasted-out building where the Charlie Hebdo gunmen died after an eight-hour siege by police has already become a macabre tourist attraction.

These dramatic pictures show the print works on an industrial estate 19 miles north east of Paris where Cherif and Said Kouachi  made their last stand.

The two-storey building, with every window shot out, was today the scene of ghoulish fascination as visitors posed for ‘selfies’ and families brought their children to gawp at the damage.

Grim lure: People gathered today at the print works where the Charlie Hebdo gunmen made their last stand

History: From behind a police cordon, ordinary passers-by recorded the scene on their camera phones

One local said: 'We came here to think about everything that happened here. The atmosphere is heavy'

Police had stormed the premises on Friday following an eight hour standoff after the gunmen took control of the small business taking owner Michele Catalano hostage.

In front of the heavily guarded building was the grey Peugeot 206 that the extremist Islamist brothers hijacked in the forest on Friday morning before setting off on a frantic car chase along the Rue National 2.

The front windscreen of the car was pierced by a single bullet hole while the back windscreen was completely shot out.

Families took their children on a bike ride past the scene as dozens of tourists snapped pictures on their camera phones.

One Italian tourist, Pio Pirolo, asked a bystander to take a selfie of him, saying: ‘I want to show everyone that I was here. Some day this will be history.’

Blown out: The windows of the print works were destroyed during the eight-hour standoff with police

The industrial estate is around 19 miles from the centre of Paris near the city's Charles de Gaulle airport

Damage: The religious fanatics had said they would only emerge from their hideout as martyrs

An elderly man taking pictures of his wife on his camera phone said: ‘We just wanted to see it in person, not just on the news.’

One local resident, who lives opposite the factory, brought his two sons to see the site after attending a march in the morning.

Fabrice Bruneau, a recruitment consultant, said: ‘We came here to think about everything that happened here, to remember it. The atmosphere is heavy here.'

The father-of-two said he spent the siege crouched in his shower room: ‘We hid in our bathroom the whole day watching the scene on smartphone TV.

‘At 6pm we heard explosions and the windows all vibrated. I was so scared because of our children.

‘There is no more liberty in France. People are too scared. ‘

No change: The Peugeot 206 which the brothers hijacked on the morning of the siege remained outside

‘We are living in a terrible age. We have a problem with integration. We need to do something. These people are a risk.’

Cherif Kouachi and his brother Said sparked global horror when they burst into the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and slaughtered 12 people last Wednesday, including a police officer outside the building.

The extremists spent two days on the run until they were gunned down at the industrial estate in Dammartin, which is near Charles de Gaulle Airport.

The end to the pursuit played out on live TV and social media as one hostage was eventually freed from the printing plant. 

Graphic designer Lilian Lepere, 27, who was inside the building, hid in a cardboard box and sent text messages to police after realising the Charlie Hebdo killers were holed up in his office. 

He told friends: 'I'm not a hero. I just did what anyone would do to save their own life.

'I just did what any normal person would do if they were in the same situation.'
