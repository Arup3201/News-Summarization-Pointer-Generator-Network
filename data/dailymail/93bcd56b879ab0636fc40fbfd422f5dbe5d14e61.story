Arrival: Prince Harry has arrived in Sydney, Australia, ahead of his appearance at the harbour tomorrow

A mystery drone has crashed into Sydney Harbour Bridge - just three days before Prince Harry arrives at the harbour to review an international navy fleet.

The prince, who arrived in Sydney  this afternoon, is due to make an appearance at the city's harbour tomorrow to help Australia celebrate its navy's centenary.

He will be joined by more than 55 warships, galleons and tall ships from around the world.

However, counter terrorism teams have been placed on high alert after the remote-controlled 'quad-copter' was discovered at the foot of one of the iconic bridge's pylons.

Officials have said they do not believe the drone - which crashed on Wednesday -  is linked to the International Navy Fleet Review, which has already attracted thousands of spectators to Sydney Harbour and its foreshore.

No one has yet come forward to claim the aircraft, and an investigation has been launched by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA).

'Investigations are continuing, but anyone with information or who knows who owns it is invited to contact police,' an official told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Police are understood to be examining footage captured by a camera attached to the drone.

Mr Peter Gibson, a CASA spokesman, said: 'New South Wales police have contacted CASA about an incident at the Sydney Harbour Bridge.'

He said the incident involved 'a small remotely-piloted helicopter being operated as a model aircraft (which) has collided with one of the pylons'.

He added: 'It is early to draw any conclusions, but this would appear on the surface of it to be operating a machine in an area which would probably be inappropriate.

'Certainly, colliding with the bridge structure is something that shouldn't have happened.'

Greeting: Harry waves at fans, before being escorted to his official Sydney residence, which is nestled beside the harbour

Mr Gibson pointed out that anyone 
remotely-piloting a small aircraft must ensure they are kept at least 30
 yards from people, buildings or structures.

Checks
 have to be made with local councils where aircraft of this type can be 
used - and the airspace around the Harbour Bridge was restricted, even 
for small aircraft like drones, he said.

Aside from the drone incident, security 
around Prince Harry is likely to be extremely tight for his day at the harbour.

Today, the region was already a buzz of 
activity today, with crowds cheering, sailors saluting and helicopters 
putting on displays while flying the Australian navy flag.

Prince Harry's schedule will see him take to the water for several hours, before 
going on a 'meet the people' walk on the foreshore.

Later, he will attend a party being hosted by newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Abbott at his official Sydney residence, which is nestled beside the harbour.

This will be followed by what officials promise to be a 'spectacular' fireworks display.
