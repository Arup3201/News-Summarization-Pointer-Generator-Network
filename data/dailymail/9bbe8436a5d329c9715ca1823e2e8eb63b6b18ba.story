How on earth has Arsene Wenger escaped criticism for yet another failure in Europe?

They won on the night – fine. They went out on away goals – sure, it couldn't have been closer.

But they lost to Monaco – arguably the worst side to make it through the group stage.

Failing to win the group has been Wenger's massive error in recent seasons. That's why they've faced the European giants early and failed to make the quarter-finals. 

And yet again, despite being in a group with two no-hopers – Galatasaray and Anderlecht, and a Borussia Dortmund side that spent the first half of the season hovering in and around the relegation zone in the Bundesliga – Arsenal failed to top their group.

But they got that stroke of luck everyone says you need if you are going to win the Champions League. They were paired with Monaco, a team defensively sound but offensively weak.

I'm going to keep this simple: Arsenal have better players than Monaco. So surely an experienced manager, well versed in French football and Champions League football, especially familiar with his opponents – a club he once managed – with a squad featuring two arguably world-class players in Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez, not even Wenger could mess this one up?

Monaco are effective, but they are a basic side. In other words, it shouldn't take a tactical genius to work out how to beat them. They got into the Champions League thanks to the quality of James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao (before his injury), but they have since lost those star players.

And yet Wenger failed to do this.

For the fifth season running Arsenal failed to make the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

Damage done in the first leg, and Per Mertesacker said their mentality wasn't right. Therefore the manager has to take the blame for sending his players out with the wrong mentality.

Last season, Mertesacker said Arsenal 'gave 10 per cent less mentally' when they were beaten by Napoli to miss out on top spot in the group. Wenger culpable for not preparing his players properly yet again. His preparation of his own team is poor. His ability to out-coach opponents is poor.

And still there are people who think he is the right man to manage Arsenal. Some even have the audacity to cling on to that well-worn myth that he had every right not to win big trophies while Arsenal paid for the stadium. Hard to believe gullible Gooners fell for that one. The income and assets from day one at the new stadium meant Arsenal could always compete. Unfortunately Wenger misjudged the impact of Financial Fair Play, another mistake he made.

The case for Wenger's defence is getting weaker and weaker.

Sure, three other English clubs failed in the Champions League this season. Manchester City might change their manager because of it. That's a man who won the title last season.

Chelsea know that they have a manager who has already won the Champions League twice before, so his track record is proven. But we all know that if he persistently fails to get to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, Mourinho won't last at the Bridge. And at Liverpool Brendan Rodgers went into his first ever Champions League campaign shorn of Luis Suarez and the injured Daniel Sturridge. He was a rookie and he made big mistakes. Wenger is making equally huge mistakes despite all his years of European experience.

So many people are sitting around wringing their hands about why English clubs fail in Europe. No wonder we fail when a club as huge as Arsenal trusts a proven European failure with its Champions League ambitions, and then does nothing when he fails time after time.

He's the only manager to reach three different European finals and lose them all – Cup Winners' Cup with Monaco, UEFA Cup and Champions League with Arsenal.

Wenger's 17 straight seasons in the Champions League are an embarrassment when you consider he has only reached one final, and two semi-finals in that time.

Is there anyone else who could do better? There really are people stupid enough to ask that question. If you want a young manager who will be bold and brave in the face of bigger-spending more illustrious opponents then go for the youthful energy of Diego Simeone or Jurgen Klopp. Both have won domestic titles in recent seasons when they could have done what Wenger does every year and wave the white flag because he can't handle what he calls the 'financial doping' of the likes of Man City and Chelsea.

If you want proven winners, then Wenger's £8m-a-year salary will surely tempt the quality of Pep Guardiola or Carlo Ancelotti.

Why is it that a juggernaut of a club like Arsenal sticks with a manager who regularly fails when it comes to the big moments? Are they content to miss out?

Finishing second wasn't good enough for Thierry Henry, remember? So he left the stinking, sinking ship to go and finish first with Barcelona. That was a long, long time ago of course, but still the fallen Emirates empire remains ruined.

The failure to win the Champions League will always be a huge scabby wart on Wenger's record.

But Wenger isn't bigger than Arsenal. He is replaceable.

He's guilty of failing in Europe with Arsenal and making a massive contribution to the diminishing reputation of English clubs in European competition.

Being knocked out by Monaco should be the final straw for Wenger. It would be for any other manager of one of Europe's elite clubs.
