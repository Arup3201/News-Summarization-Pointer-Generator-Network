Under fire: Michael Reingold, 53, a former NYPD officer and supervisor at a Bronx clinic, has been named in a federal lawsuit filed by his former staffer accusing him of raping her 18 times

A New York City social worker has filed a federal lawsuit accusing her former supervisor - a one-time police officer - of raping her 18 times inside a locked office.

The 47-year-old Bronx resident, identified as Jane Doe in court papers, claims she was subjected to the unwelcome advances from her boss, 53-year-old Michael Reingold, from the day she was hired by the Highbridge Woodycrest Center in July 2012.

Reingold, a retired NYPD officer, headed the center affiliated with Lebanon Hospital until last fall.

According to the alleged victim’s lawsuit, Mr Reingold never missed an opportunity to remind her that he was a retired cop, and that she was required to follow his orders, or face termination.

In court filings, the 47-year-old social worker stated that Reingold made passes at her, told her colleagues that the two of them were having an affair and then relocated her to a remote office, where the staffer allegedly felt 'imprisoned.'

Sometime after the move, Jane Doe said Reingold walked into her new office, locked the door and forced himself on her. Afterwards, the man allegedly threatened to fire her if she said a word about what happened to anyone.

‘The office in which [Reingold] placed plaintiff became a veritable “Torture Chamber” where [he] would violate [her] in the most unspeakable ways,’ the lawsuit obtained by the New York Post alleged.

Her 
predicament took a toll on the social worker, who would vomit from fear 
and anxiety allegedly caused by her boss, the court papers stated.

Speaking to the Post, Jane Doe said she was living in constant fear, and that Reingold warned her he had a gun.

‘I didn’t pick up the phone and call the cops because he was one of them,’ she told the paper.

The alleged sexual attacks on the woman were exacerbated by the fact that as a young girl, she  had been assaulted by six men in the subway, according to the suit. 

Last July, the social worker finally reported the alleged abuse to human resources director Maria Collura, who in response urged her to leave, or Reingold would hurt her.

Jane Doe quit her job at the center July 8, 2013. Reingold was fired that fall after his alleged victim filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

According to his LinkedIn page, Reingold graduated from John Jay College of Criminal Justice with a master's degree in public administration in 2010 and was hired by the Highbridge Woodycrest Center in October 2011.

After being fired last fall, Reingold got a job as an investigator for the company Legends Hospitality, which works with the New York Yankees.

The 53-year-old man has a daughter, a recent high school graduate, who is also affiliated with the Yankees.
