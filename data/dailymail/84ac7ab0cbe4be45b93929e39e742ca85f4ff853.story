Sick teenagers who filmed themselves throwing a kitten around a room and swinging it by its tail were caught after posting their video on Facebook.

Two girls, aged 15 and 16, can be seen violently flinging the eight-week-old animal at each other and laughing hysterically in a bedroom at one of their homes on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.

The callous teenagers were fined £85, given a nine-month referral order and disqualified from keeping animals for a year after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to a kitten at Maidstone Youth Court.

Callous: The two girls, aged 15 and 16, throw the tortoiseshell kitten back and forth, cackling hysterically as they swing the defenceless creature by its legs and tail

Cruel: The teenagers posted the 36-second clip of them abusing the distressed animal on Facebook

Vicious: The eight-week-old cat at one point appears to be knocked unconscious after smashing into the ceiling

They can be heard giggling uncontrollably during the disturbing 36-second clip, in which the kitten appears to be knocked unconscious after hitting the ceiling.

The girls still do not stop, however, and violently throw the pet across the room two more times in the clip, which they posted on Facebook.

RSPCA chief inspector Steve Dockery said: 'This was shocking footage of young girls violently throwing an eight-week-old kitten around.

'The girls' commentary on the video shows that they found their actions to be hilariously funny, which is worrying.

'The abuse of a young animal purely for entertainment cannot be tolerated and posting it on a social networking site sends out a message that animal cruelty is acceptable.

'Worrying': The RSPCA said the fact the girls posted the 'shocking' video online as entertainment sends out a message that animal cruelty is acceptable

'The kitten was lucky to survive her ordeal and has since been re-homed with a new and loving family.'

The teenagers, who must also pay £85 each in court costs, were caught after a member of the public spotted their video on Facebook and reported it to the police.

A vet who examined the kitten after her ordeal in August said she would have suffered massive distress and it was a miracle she had not sustained severe physical injuries.

A third girl, aged 16, who is accused of filming the attack, pleaded not guilty and is due to appear for trial later in the year.
