A baroness living in a luxury Manhattan hotel has been accused of charming a widowed Nepalese diplomat into leaving her a large portion of his $5 million fortune.

Relatives of Shail Upadhya, a UN disarmament expert-turned-fashion designer, are suing Baroness von Langendorff over claims that she did them out of an inheritance.

The aristocratic Austrian is accused of wooing the recently widowed Upadhya before his death, to make him sign over a portfolio of luxury properties in the Hamptons and Miami.

Upadhya had been left the properties by his long-term partner Karen Bass, who died of cancer in 2012.

The couple had been together for 30 years and, in her will, Bass wrote: 'My dearest Shail ... I have always loved you, and I will watch over you always.'

It was at her funeral that Baroness von Langendorff allegedly first met Upadhya, according to the lawsuit.

A close friend of Bass is said to have then contacted Upadhya's family in Nepal to warn them of the 'scary' baroness.

The friend, Joy Marks, told the New York Post: 'He was so ill, he was like putty in her hands. I knew his intentions were for the estate to go to the family.'

Formal: The baroness is said to enjoy dinner parties and balls, where she is always adorned in precious jewels

The red-headed widow of Baron Walter 
Langer von Langendorff, who created the White Shoulders perfume is known
 in New York society circles for her glamorous jewellery that was said 
to be gifts from admirers.

Her
 first husband was the creator of several perfumes, including White 
Shoulders. When he died in the 1980s she inherited his fortune, 
including a 32-acre waterfront property in Long Island.

She
 lives at the lavish Pierre Hotel and is rumored to have her fur coats 
dyed to match the emeralds and sapphires adorning her, according to New York Social Diary.

The
 Baroness, who in her youth was courted by some of the most prominent 
European bachelors, was famed for her 'milkmaid' complexion and 
'tumbling flaming tresses'.

Living a high life of dinner parties and entertaining, where the dress code is always formal, the Baroness was once heard to declare: 'I never wear a watch at night. I don't want to know what time it is at night,' as she lifted a hand that supported 'a ring with a diamond the size of a prune'.

By contrast, Upadhya's relatives live in Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world. Although he spent most of his life in the U.S. Upadhya visited family there regularly.

Three of his half siblings have claimed in a lawsuit lodged with Mahattan Surrogate's Court that the Baroness used 'force, flattery, threats' to encourage an ailing Upadhya to disinherit them.

The diplomat, who took early retirement to begin a career in fashion, died last year, aged 79.

'They’re struggling and she’s living at The Pierre. How do you do that to someone,' Marks said.

An attorney fo Baroness von Langendorff has not commented on the allegations or lawsuit.
