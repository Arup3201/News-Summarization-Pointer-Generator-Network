The student accused of stabbing and shooting to death a Purdue University this week pleaded not guilty to murder Thursday in court.

Cody Cousins, 23 is accused of murdering  teaching assistant Andrew Boldt, 21, in a basement classroom before surrendering to police.

The accused killer stormed the campus electrical engineering building around noon Tuesday, making his way to a basement classroom to kill Mr Boldt, authorities told the Indianapolis Star.

He barely spoke during
 the Thursday hearing, answering only yes or no when prompted by the 
judge, according to the Indianapolis Star.

His father, mother and sister were in attendance, but did not speak to media.

Cousins was not charged with capital murder, which could bring the death penalty, but aggravating circumstances could change that, the judge said.

Bond was denied and the judge automatically entered Cousins' not guilty plea, which the Star noted is a standard practice for murder cases in the state.

Witnesses saw Cousins coldly stab and then shoot Boldt to death in the classroom, authorities said.

Cousins was calmly 
sitting Tuesday outside the building with his hands behind his back 
after carrying out the brutal murder, authorities said.

He was covered in blood and bloody foot 
prints led from the classroom where Boldt was savagely murdered, the 
prosecutor said during the hearing.

The alleged 23-year-old 
gunman put up no resistance when he was 
arrested.

Officers were seen raiding a home believed to belong to Cousins, near the Indiana campus, at about 4pm Tuesday.

Police
 Chief John Cox told Heavy that the shooting was not random and that 
Cousins, who was also a teaching assistant, has been 
arrested in connection with it.

Although they were both from the same department, it was not clear how well Cousins and Mr Boldt knew each other.

No motive has been publicly stated, and attempts by MailOnline to reach local authorities for further information were unsuccessful.

They both shared the same professor, David Meyer, although for different classes.

Cox added to JC Online there had been 'little to no cooperation with the individual we took into custody'.

The
 shooting took place in a basement classroom of the electrical 
engineering building, and police confirmed no other suspects were being 
sought.

Student Nick Wieland said he was in a neighboring classroom when he heard gunfire.

'I
 heard a couple [shots] and then I heard a man scream,' Mr Wieland said.
 '[I was] just very scared. Thatâ€™s what I felt the entire time.'

The
 ambitious undergraduate teaching assistant had been highly praised 
during his time at two electrical engineering internships

Shut down: Police quickly locked down the campus Tuesday as they took Cousins into custody from in front of an electrical engineering building

On
 campus, he had been president of the Cary Racing - Purdue Grand Prix 
from 2011 to 2013, and was on the executive council of the computing and
 electrical engineering student society.

As reports of the shooting were announced, 'shelter-in-place' warnings were put in place across campus.

'Shooting reported on campus; Bldg. 
Electrical Engineering; avoid area; shelter in place,' the school wrote 
on Tuesday on Twitter, ending with a link to the school website.

That tweet was sent out at 12.30pm to their more than 34,800,000 
followers and just over ten minutes later, they reported that a suspect 
was in custody.

Students told The Journal & Courier that they heard gunshots and believed that two shots may have been fired.

By mid-afternoon the warnings had been lifted from the West 
Lafayette, Indiana campus with the exception of the electrical 
engineering building where the shooting took place.

David Boudia, a
Purdue alum who won a gold medal for diving during the 2012 Summer Olympic games, tweeted throughout the incident.

He posted a photo of 
what appeared to be a man being taken into custody while being surrounded
 by armed police officers.

Boudia also tweeted claims a second shooter had been taken into custody from a different building, and another student on the campus tweeted a similar statement.

Those reports were later refuted by school officials who said there was only one shooter, who was already in police custody.

Vigil: Students and friends of the victim gathered on campus Tuesday night to remember him

Loss: Andrew Boldt was involved in several university groups

Free to move: The 'shelter in place' warning was lifted from all other buildings before finally being removed from the electrical engineering building which is now closed and considered a crime scene

Responding with force: The local police and SWAT teams were on the scene within minutes

Students described a chaotic scene when the first report
came in.

Julissa Martinez, a freshman nursing student from Portage,
said she was in psychology class on another part of campus when she received
the text message saying the university was on lockdown.

She said her professor
briefly kept teaching, then stopped lecturing so that students could contact
people to let them know they were safe.

'He tried to get everything under control because people
were freaking out,' she said.

She said students were nervous because there was a lot of
speculation about the severity of the situation.

'It was scary because you hear about it, but you never
expect it to happen on your campus,' Martinez said.

Senior Saran Mishra, editor of the Purdue Exponent, the
campus newspaper, said some students reported hearing fire alarms and were told
to evacuate.

'Right now I'm still in shock,' he said.
