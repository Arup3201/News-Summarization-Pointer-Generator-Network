Nearly a third of Americans - 27% - now get news from smartphone and tablet apps such as Mail Online's, according to a new study by the Pew Research Center.

But people don't rely on apps as a 'one 
stop shop' - 80 per cent of web users who pick up news from phone apps 
also visit the news websites via a laptop or desktop.

The survey, of 3,000 web users and part of a report by the non-profit research group, also found that search engines were declining as a means for people to find news, and now took second place to apps.

The research found that there was a huge overlap between people who found news stories via smartphone apps and those who used PCs - eight out of ten app users also visited sites via their PCs

'Eight in ten who get news on smartphones or tablets, for instance, get news on conventional computers as well,' Pew said in its report.

'People are taking advantage, in other words, of having easier access to news throughout the day – in their pocket, on their desks and in their laps.'

And although 54 per cent of Americans - 133 million people - are active users of Facebook, 'social media' sites such as Facebook and Twitter were less important than sites or apps in driving traffic to websites.

Just 9% of U.S. adults say they follow news recommendations from Facebook or Twitter ‘very often’ on any digital device -  compared with 36% who say the same about directly going to a news organization’s site or app.

Just 32% access news through search; and 29% of users who use news organizing sites like Topix or Flipboard.

Pew's report, which also used data from web-monitoring firm Nielsen and the American Audit Bureau of circulations, said that people were simply consuming MORE news.

'A mounting body of evidence finds that the spread of mobile technology is adding to news consumption, strengthening the appeal of traditional news brands and even boosting reading of long-form journalism,' said Pew in its report.

'Our analysis suggests that news is becoming a more important and 
pervasive part of people’s lives,' Pew Director Tom Rosenstiel said. 'But it remains unclear who will benefit economically from this growing 
appetite for news.'

Pew's research, using data from monitoring firm Nielsen as well as America's Audit Bureau of Circulation, shows how online audience share has grown - and that the sector is showing revenue growth in advertising as a direct result

Privacy is becoming a bigger issue for consumers, creating conflicting pressures on news organizations. Roughly two-thirds of internet users are uneasy with targeted advertising and search engines tracking their behavior, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. At the same time, though, consumers rely more heavily on the services provided by the companies that gather such data. News organizations are caught in between. To survive, they must find ways to make their digital advertising more effective — and more lucrative. Yet they also must worry about violating the trust of audiences to protect their strongest assets — their brands.
