The cost of using the internet on a tablet in Europe is to be more than halved (posed by model)

Excessive charges for using smartphones and laptops to access the internet and emails while abroad are to be slashed.

Travellers can be billed up to 50 times more than at home to download a song, picture or map, generating huge bills.

These so-called data roaming charges can be as much as £10.70 per megabyte, which would be equivalent to downloading a single picture or a minute of music.

However, the EU has announced plans for a cap that will bring down the average charge of £2 per megabyte to 80p from July next year.

There are plans to cut the figure further to 45p in July 2014.

The new price regime will only apply to EU citizens visiting another member state.

There will be no protection for those travelling to other destinations such as Turkey, the U.S. or Australia.

The proposals were outlined by EU digital chief Neelie Kroes, who is hoping new companies, such as supermarkets, will enter the market to increase competition.

The eventual aim is to bring the cost of using smartphones and laptops overseas to around the same level as at home.

The EU has already capped the price of calls and texts from other EU nations.

Monique Goyens, of European consumers' group BEUC, welcomed the price cap, saying: 'It's unjustifiable that data roaming can be 50 times more expensive than when at home.'

The move comes after the EU last week extended the cap on mobile phone call roaming charges by a further four years, to 2016.

However, it comes as a blow to mobile operators who will also have to comply with new regulations on calls and SMS messages.

Savings: The cost in euros of making and receiving calls while abroad has fallen slowly since 2009

The proposals to cut the cost of data roaming are part of plans by Kroes to slash cross-border mobile charges by 2015.

And there will be a clause to phase out the price caps before 2016, should the structural measures result in cheaper international calls.

Richard Feasey, public policy director at Vodafone, told the Financial Times: 'It's good the Commission is reflecting on new options for regulating the roaming market and has recognised that price caps have major drawbacks.'

Last week an EU directive was introduced to force down the cost of making and receiving mobile phone calls while in Europe.

EU's Digital Agenda Commissioner Neelie Kroes wants to 'address the lack of competition'

The rules mean that the maximum 
permitted charge will be no more than 32p per minute, excluding VAT, for
calls made while abroad - down from 35p.

It also will cost not more than 10p per minute for calls received while abroad in EU countries.

The cost of sending a text message remains at a maximum of 10p while it costs nothing to receive one.

The
changes bring the EU a step closer to making sure that within three 
years it will be the same price to use a mobile either at home or 
abroad.

Commissioners have 
taken action because network operators are making profits of an 
astonishing 200 per cent on calls made in Europe and a staggering 400 
per cent on calls received.

The cost of sending a text message remains at a maximum of 10p while it costs nothing to receive one.

But despite this, existing rules to prevent bill shocks for using the internet on a mobile while abroad remain weak.

Operators
must only apply an automatic 50 Euros or £45 cut-off limit on accounts 
unless the customer explicitly agrees otherwise, but need not do 
anything else.

Operators must warn customers when they reach 80 per cent of their limit.

The
EU's Digital Agenda Commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted last week that 
despite the cuts, a lack of open competition means operators are still 
making massive profits on foreign calls and internet use.

Still expensive: Consumers arriving in Europe by air, sea or rail will have the cost of using their phone abroad cut but mobile internet prices are still very high

'These
latest price caps will temporarily reduce retail prices for making and 
receiving voice calls when in another EU country during the coming 
year,' he said.

'But we have to tackle roaming problems at the root with a long-lasting structural approach.

'The Commission will therefore be coming forward very shortly with comprehensive new proposals for long-term solutions to address the underlying problem of lack of competition in roaming markets.'

Making calls: 3p cheaper

Receiving calls: Capped at 10p per minute

Sending Texts: 10p (maximum)

Receiving texts: Free

Data roaming (internet): £45 limit*

Browsing internet or receiving emails: No more than 81p per megabyte from July 2012, falling to 40p by 2014

* Unless requested.

Compulsory maximum roaming rates were first imposed on mobile network operators four years ago to tackle what the Commission called the 'roaming rip-off'.

A legal claim by the networks that the Commission was exceeding its powers failed last year, and rates fell further.

Action by Brussels against high roaming charges has been one of the most popular consumer-driven moves by the EU.

On average there has been a 60 per cent cut in the maximum charges operators could levy on mobile users making or receiving calls while in another EU country since 2007.

Last week's additional price drop means mobile roaming charges are about 75 per cent cheaper on average than they were six years ago when the Commission first urged operators to cut their rates voluntarily.

The current roaming rules apply until June 2012 and the European Commission is due to present its plans for the following period next week.
