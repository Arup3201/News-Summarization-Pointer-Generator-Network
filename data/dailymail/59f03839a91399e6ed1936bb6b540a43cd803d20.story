She says she's blessed with the biggest cleavage in Britain, but Claire Smedley is terrified her 40MMM breasts will kill her relationship.

Three years ago her ex-boyfriend nearly died when she suffocated him with her breasts him during sex. They have since grown even bigger and now weigh 2.5 stone each.

The 30-year-old mother-of-three, who lives in Derby with her new boyfriend Chris Willgoose, says she worries it could happen again, and is always on her guard during sex.

Claire Smedley, who lives in Derby with her new boyfriend Chris Willgoose, says she is always on her guard during sex after her ex-boyfriend nearly suffocated

Claire says she demands sex up to five times a day, blaming high oestrogen levels for both her libido and her large breasts

She said: 'Once he’s had enough he’ll tap my leg and I’ll get off. It’s nice to know he appreciates them, but I won’t let things go too far.

'My last relationship ended because he was too scared to have sex with me. I don’t want that to happen again.'

Claire says she demands sex up to five times a day, blaming high oestrogen levels for both her libido and big breasts.

She said: 'I read on the internet that high oestrogen levels can make your breasts grow, so I’m guessing that’s what’s causing it.

'I’ve been to the doctor but they didn’t know what was wrong. It’s got to the point now where I’m terrified they won’t stop growing.'

When Claire was 11, she went for her first bra fitting and discovered she was a C cup.

Claire, who claims her 40MMM breasts are the biggest in Britain, says she has started to make a glamour modelling career off the back of them

She said: 'Mum and dad joked that I went to bed and came downstairs the next morning with massive knockers.

'At the time I was so embarrassed. Girls at school used to unclip my bra strap during assembly, while boys stared at my boobs as though they were from outer space. I used to sleep on my front hoping they wouldn’t grow anymore.'

But by the time she turned 12, she’d shot up to a DD cup.

She said: 'Everyone always thought I was older than I was. Sometimes the bus driver wouldn’t let me on with a child fare - it was so humiliating.'

By the time Claire turned 16, they’d swelled to an H cup.

She said: 'I was told to cover up in my local church in case I led the men into temptation.'

But the advice from the church had the exact opposite effect on the teen.

Claire said: 'I was angry - after all I thought, "it’s not my fault". So I decided to rebel, getting rid of all my turtle necks in exchange for spaghetti string tops. Even though I didn’t like my boobs, they were a part of me. I was tired of pretending to be someone I wasn’t.'

By the time Claire turned 18, her breasts had grown to a J cup, swamping her size 6 frame.

She said: 'I looked ridiculous, though I always received appreciative stares from men. I desperately hoped that the growth spurt had come to an end because I’d started to get scared. I didn’t know what I’d do if they kept on growing. I considered a breast reduction, but the thought of a surgeon hacking away at my breasts terrified me.'

But the biggest threat wasn’t to Claire - it was to her boyfriend.

When Claire was 27, ex-boyfriend Mark nearly died when she suffocated him with her 40LL breasts which weighed more than a stone each.

Claire said she had considered a breast reduction, but it is not an option because her BMI is too high for surgery

Claire, pictured at the age of 21, would need to lose eight stone for a reduction to be carried out safely

She said: 'Usually, he loved being smothered by them, and on this occasion, he started flailing around wildly. But I assumed it was because he was so excited, so I kept going. A few minutes later, I noticed he’d stopped moving.'

By then Mark, also 27, was still and appeared not to be breathing.

Claire said: 'I was panicking and was just about to call 999 when thankfully he started to come round. He appeared dazed and confused but then he sat up and coughed. I was so relieved.'

Claire has rekindled a relationship with old flame Chris Willgoose, whom she married aged 21 but later split from

But after Mark’s near death experience, the couple’s sex life flagged. Claire said: 'After that, he went right off sex.'

The pair split up three months later, while her breasts continued to grow.

She said: 'They were showing no signs that they were about to stop growing, so I knew I had to start taking precautions.'

When Claire managed to rekindle a relationship with old flame Chris Willgoose, whom she married aged 21 but later split from, she knew she was treading on thin ice.

Claire, who now has three children with Chris - aged three, six, and nine, said: 'I knew Chris loved my boobs, but I couldn’t put his life at risk. So we devised a safety precaution where he’d tap my leg if it ever gets too much, and I’d climb off.'

Claire, who claims her 40MMM breasts are the biggest in Britain, says she has started to make a glamour modelling career off the back of them.

She said: 'I’ve got a lot of fans in Germany, so it would be great to go over there and tap the market.'

But behind the glitz and glam, Claire reveals that having big breasts is not easy.

She said: 'I get back ache all the time. And doing simple things, like tying my shoelaces or running after the kids, is impossible.

'Shops never stock my bra size, so the only option is to get one tailor made, but that costs £200. And while some women might like the attention from men, not all of it’s flattering.

'In fact, most of it’s rather unimaginative - "get em out", "look at the size of em" and so on, but when someone tries to pull your dress down in a bar, it’s not funny.

Claire says she suffers from back ache and finds it difficult to do simple things, such as tying her shoelaces or running after her children

Claire's partner Chris has said he will support whatever decision she makes when it comes to whether she should have a breast reduction

'Sometimes, when the straps on my top have snapped under their weight, I’ve come home holding my clothes up and desperate for a breast reduction.'

But for Claire, a breast reduction isn’t an option. Weighing 20 stone, Claire’s BMI is too high for surgery. She would need to lose eight stone for a reduction to be carried out safely.

She said: 'Sometimes I do think I would like a reduction, but I know I’d need to lose weight first. Even so, I don’t know how I’d feel having smaller breasts. I don’t know if I’d be the same person and it would most certainly end my modelling career.'

Meanwhile Claire’s partner Chris is prepared to support whatever decision she makes.

He said: 'Obviously I love Claire’s breasts - I’ve had a lot of fun with them. But I’ll support whatever decision she makes as I just want her to be comfortable - it’s her body at the end of the day.'
