A Saudi arrested at a Detroit airport for carrying a pressure cooker in his luggage is a victim of a misunderstanding by overzealous U.S. customs agents, the man's lawyer said.

Hussain Al Khawahir, 33, was detained after arriving at Detroit Metropolitan Airport  on a flight from Amsterdam on Saturday.

'I'm afraid that some overzealous agents
were looking for anything,' said James Howarth, who is representing Mr Al Khawahir, said. 'They see a pressure cooker and say, "This is a
man who has to be detained".'

Pressure cookers packed with explosive powder and shrapnel were set off at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, in an attack that killed three people and injured 264.

Departure: Hussain Al Khawahir was travelling from Schiphol Airport, Amsterdam when he was stopped in Detroit for carrying a pressure cooker

Mr Howarth said many people from Saudi Arabia travel with pressure cookers to cook lamb.

'Carrying a pressure cooker in America is not against the law,' he added.

On May 11, Mr Al Khawahir was 
questioned about two missing pages from his passport and the pressure 
cooker he had in his luggage, according to a complaint filed by federal 
prosecutors.

He said initially he brought the 
pressure cooker from Saudi Arabia for his nephew, a student at the 
University of Toledo in Ohio, because they are not sold in America.

He later said that his nephew had 
bought a pressure cooker, but it was cheap and broke when he tried to 
use it, according to the complaint.

Mr Al Khawahir is charged with offering false information to customs agents, part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Mr Howarth spoke to reporters at a hearing on Tuesday to determine whether Mr Al Khawahir would be released on bond.

His lawyer said he asked that the 
hearing not proceed because it was clear Mr Al Khawahir would continue 
to be detained by U.S. customs authorities whatever the outcome of the 
hearing.

Final destination: The Saudi was stopped by Customs agents at Detroit Metropolitan Airport and questioned about missing pages in his passport

A May 28 date was set to determine whether U.S. prosecutors have enough evidence to bring the matter to a federal court.

The missing pages from Mr Al 
Khawahir's passport were near the back of the book and were not likely 
to have been important, Mr Howarth said.

Mr Al Khawahir had told agents he did not know how the pages had 
been removed, and said the document had been locked in a box that only 
he, his wife, and three children have access to in his home, according 
to the complaint.

Mr Al 
Kwawahir was read his Miranda rights, which he said he understood, and 
he invoked his right to remain silent, according to the complaint.

He said that if Mr Al Khawahir had been carrying a different kitchen appliance, his competing statements about it 
would not be cause for alarm.

'If he had made a mistake about an 
electric skillet, he would be in Toledo today,' Mr Howarth told 
reporters. Toledo is about 60 miles south of Detroit.

Tool of terror: Twisted metal belonging to a pressure cooker used in the deadly Boston marathon bombings of April 15

Mr Al Khawahir faces up to five years in federal prison if he is found guilty of giving false information to the U.S. agents.

Customs and Border Protection officials and the FBI declined comment on Mr Al Khawahir's case.

His nephew also says the case is a misunderstanding, and that the pressure cooker his uncle was bringing for him was so he could cook lamb.

Nasser Almarzooq, told The Associated Press on Monday that he'd asked his uncle, Hussain Al Kwawahir, to bring him a pressure cooker because the ones he bought in the U.S. didn't work.

Mr Almarzooq said he was concerned about his uncle and had not been told anything since his Saturday arrest. His uncle had been coming to visit him for a couple weeks.

Mr Al Kwawahir is accused of using a passport with a missing page and making false statements about why he was traveling with the pressure cooker.
