Extraordinary: The clips show inhabitants of Colditz in a more relaxed light, joking around and smiling for the camera

Colditz may have been a notorious Nazi prisoner of war camp, but a newly-unearthed film shows its inmates and guards still found time to fool around.

The extraordinary footage – the only 
known film of prisoners and guards inside the camp – was found 
70 years after it was shot. It will be screened for the first time on Channel 4 tonight.

The clips show inhabitants of the camp in a more relaxed light, joking around and smiling for the camera.

The grainy colour film also shows prisoners gathered for a roll call in the isolated Renaissance  castle, which formed the most secure prison camp in the Third Reich.

Colditz,
 near Leipzig, Dresden, and Chemnitz in the state of Saxony, was built 
on the side of a cliff above the Mulde river in the 11th Century.

It
 gained international fame as a prisoner of war camp during the Second 
World War for 'incorrigible' Allied officers who had repeatedly escaped 
from other camps.

The 
castle housed around 500 Allied officers, among them the legendary 
Battle of Britain pilot Sir Douglas Bader, and was meant to be 
impossible to escape from.

But Allied officers made a series of 
daring attempts and by the end of the war it boasted one of the highest 
records of successful escapes.

The castle only received its first Americans in August 1944. They were 49-year-old Colonel Florimund Duke - the oldest American paratrooper of the war - Captain Guy Nunn, and Alfred Suarez.

They were all counter-intelligence operatives parachuted into Hungary to prevent it joining forces with Germany.

When U.S. troops liberated Colditz in April 1945, 31 prisoners had successfully reached home after more than 300 attempts. Twelve Frenchmen made it home, 11 Britons, seven Dutch and one Pole.

At one point during the film, a group of four officers is seen laughing as they cross the bridge leading to the castle entrance. One produces a pistol and waves it at the others, one of whom responds by drawing his sword.

In another scene an officer is shown gazing out of a castle window and doffing his cap to the camera.

Two officers are also seen out and about in the East German town, with one offering a Nazi salute whilst his colleague laughs.

The new documentary tells the story of one of the most infamous prisoner of war camps of the Second World War

The most infamous of the more than 100 PoW camps in Germany was of course in Colditz Castle.

Officially
 known as Oflag IV-C, it was used to house Allied soldiers who had 
already been recaptured after fleeing from other camps, and was supposed
 to be escape-proof.

Instead,
 many of the highly motivated men there dedicated all their waking hours
 to finding new ways to outwit their German captors, meaning it was left
 with one of the highest escape rates of all.

Outrageous
 schemes included manufacturing German uniforms, dropping out of windows
 100ft high, and even building a glider in the loft.

Among
 the prisoners were Desmond Llewelyn (pictured above), who resumed his 
acting career after five years in Colditz and achieved fame as Q in the 
James Bond films.

Other 
well known POW records to be released include that of Viscount George 
Henry Hubert Lascelles, who was seventh in line to the throne at the 
time of capture, and imprisoned in Colditz from 1944 until the end of 
the war.

Some of the daring
 escapes from Colditz have also been immortalised in TV's 1970s Colditz 
series and on film in The Colditz Story.

More sinister footage shows hundreds of prisoners lined up for a roll call and exercising in the yard, walking in twos and threes.

The footage was shot by Walter Langar, a logistics and supply officer, who spent several weeks at Colditz early in the war.

It was bought by memorabilia collector Karl Hoeffkes, who alerted the castle authorities when he recognised the footage.

Tom Cook, the director, told The Daily Telegraph: 'It is very unusual to see German officers having a laugh.

'This is the first time the film has been broadcast anywhere in the world.

'It is the only known film footage of prisoners at the castle and is a very exciting find.

'Although Colditz is well-documented through still photography, we have never before been inside the castle in such a way with film.'

The film will be shown at 9pm today on Channel 4 during the documentary Escape from Colditz which also features the story of one of the most audacious escape plots.

Prisoners managed to construct a glider from materials including bedsteads, floorboards, cotton sheets and porridge and planned to fly out of the camp.

Now, 67 years later, a team of engineers
 has attempted to reconstruct and launch the Colditz Cock, as it was 
known, and lay the mystery of whether it would have worked to rest.

In total there were 186 Allied escape 
attempts before the camp was liberated on April 16, 1945.

The first of 
11 Britons to make a 'home run' was former Northern Ireland Secretary 
Airey Neave, who disguised himself as a German officer and walked out of
 the camp during a theatrical production through a trap door prisoners 
built under the stage.

History is remade: The glider after crash-landing in front of the castle

There was one major difference between the original (pictured) and the replica - the Forties glider was built to carry two prisoners, but in 2012 a polystyrene dummy, nicknamed Alex, sat in the cockpit while the aircraft was steered by remote control

The
 glider, though, was never tested because the castle was liberated by 
the Americans before the prisoners had a chance to try.

Sixteen
 British prisoners had built the two-man glider behind a false wall in 
the prison attic, in a space just 20ft by 7ft. Forty more acted as 
lookouts.

They fashioned 
tools from bedsteads and iron window bars and made the wing spars from 
floorboards, the glider skin from cotton sheets and the control wires 
from electric cable.

The finished glider spanned 33ft 9in and was 19ft 
7in long.
