Kumar Sangakkara joined Sachin Tendulkar in an exclusive club Sunday, becoming only the second batsman to pass 14,000 career runs in one-day international cricket.

The 37-year-old Sangakkara was playing against four-time champion Australia in a World Cup match at the Sydney Cricket Ground when he passed the milestone in his 402nd ODI.

He turned Glenn Maxwell for two runs down legside to reach 39. He stroked consecutive boundaries off the subsequent two deliveries and reached his 94th ODI half century from 45 balls.

The Sri Lankan batsman reached the milestone during his 24th ODI century against Australia on Sunday

Sangakkara hit unbeaten centuries in his previous two World Cup matches against Bangladesh and England.

India great Tendulkar holds the record with 18,426 ODI runs.

Sangakarra flick a ball away during another excellent innings, but it was in vain as Sri Lanka were beaten

Only Sachin Tendulkar has more ODI runs than Sangakkara, but the Indian great is still 4,000 ahead
