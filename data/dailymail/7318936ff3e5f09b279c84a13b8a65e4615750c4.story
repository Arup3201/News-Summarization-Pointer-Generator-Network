Fuschia flowers spelling 'Princess' and 'Sister', and respectively 'Jordy' and 'Megz' adorned the intricate black carriages.

A final goodbye from Jordanna's mother Vicki McCarthy, read by friend Vicki Swiffen, said: 'Jordy has always made me so proud to be her mother.

'We've always had a loyal, close relationship. Her smile was captivating and lit up any room she went into, even though she only had one dimple.

'I have not only lost Jordy but I have lost my adopted daughter Megz, too. Jordy, you are loved by so many people and I am overwhelmed and so proud to call you my daughter.

'You are my best friend, my rock, my left arm, my daughter. I promise I will make you proud.

'I will dream of you with every dream I have. You always loved your sleep, so sleep tight. I love you so much.'

The pink coffins were covered in floral tributes to the girls, whose families spoke of them during the service

Megan's father Gary Storey remained composed as he read out his moving tribute and shared his memories of the pretty teenager.

Mr Storey said: 'I never thought I would be here doing this. Megan, my baby, my angel. I will never forget the time you first sat on my lap.

'I will never forget the first time you told me you supported Sheffield Wednesday, and the first time we went to a match together.

'Arriving at Hillsborough you told my the hairs on the back of your neck were stood up, and it made me so proud.

'I will share all of the memories like this. You will forever be in my thoughts until the day we meet again. Sleep tight - I love you.'

Around 450 people are thought to have attended the ceremony which including a video made by the girls and some of their favourite music, including All of Me by John Legend and I Wanna Grow Old by DJ Cammy.

Their headteacher Rebecca Staples has said of the girls: 'Jordanna Goodwin never missed a single day of school from primary to the end of Year 11 and had received a special reward from the local authority.

'She was a joyful, bubbly girl who had a fantastic rapport with staff. She was our prom queen this year, and looked so beautiful on the evening.

'Megan Storey was a really bubbly young woman.She was totally reliable for all her friends and truly loyal.

'She was a very caring, mature young woman who was a joy to be with. She too looked stunning at our prom.'

Jordanna and Megan were sixth-formers at Danum Academy in Doncaster, as were two of the other teenagers who died - Arpad and Blake.

Warehouse worker Bartosz, whose funeral took place yesterday, was a former pupil. 

Students have laid scores of tributes to their friends outside the school's sixth-form common room and at the spot where the crash happened, on the A630 Doncaster to Rotherham road, about five miles from their school.

South Yorkshire Police believe a third car - a black Vauxhall Corsa - may also have been involved in the latest incident.

A 21-year-old Doncaster man, who was driving the Corsa, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and later released on bail while police continue their investigation.

The funerals of Blake and Arpad will take place later this week.

Tributes have also been paid to Bartosz Bortniczak, known as Bartek Kasper, after he died in the car crash
