Any music lover of a certain age will remember proudly swinging one of these iconic carrier bags on their arm after their Saturday morning visit to a record shop. 

After hours of trawling the shelves for the latest single on 45 inch vinyl or cassette tapes, teenagers would rush home to their bedrooms and listen to the eagerly awaited tracks. 

But as the world of internet downloads and online stores took over the music industry, the traditional record shops and their iconic bags have almost become a relic of the past.

These pictures show a collection of 1970s shopping bags from some of the biggest record stores in Britain - many of which are sadly no longer in existence.

Record shop bags were a big thing in the 1970s, when every High Street had a record store. Pictured is HMV's popular bag

Our Price was a prominent chain of record stores seen on all High Streets. It was founded in 1971 but went to the wall in 2004

Familiar ones includes Our Price and Soul Jazz Records - one of the few stores still in business.

There is also HMV, which will soon join the list of closed stores after going into administration after nearly 100 years of trading earlier this month.

The shopping bags were commonplace in a world where teens were only ever destined for one place on a Saturday morning - the record shop.

Grasping hard-earned pocket money, they would head for HMV, and if it didn't have what they wanted, Our Price was next on the list.

Although still a permanent fixture of the High Street, WHSmith no longer sells CDs

The epitome of cool: Carrying around a bag full of newly-purchased records was considered a cool fashion accessory

Andy's Records was founded in 1969 in Felixstowe, Bury St Edmonds, and continued trading right up until 2003

As the stores themselves have disappeared over the years, their carrier bags have become collector's items and attract hundreds of bids on eBay from music lovers.

This rare collection of bags are a stark reminder of how the evolution of the music industry has impacted on Britain’s high streets.

The increased popularity of websites like Amazon and Play.com has impacted heavily on our high streets.

Despite a proud history of being the most popular record store, HMV has struggled over the past few years from fierce supermarket and online competition.

Its flagship store and the first ever HMV - His Master's Voice - was opened by the Gramophone Company on Oxford Street in 1921.

The bags came in many different shapes, styles 
and forms. Pictured left is a brown paper carrier from Rock Dreams,

Over the years, the company went from strength to strength and stores were opened in almost every town across the country.

Everyone in Britain would be able to recognise its logo of the dog Nipper 
listening to a cylinder phonograph - painted by 1899 by Francis Barraud.

But the music and film retailer was not quick enough to embrace the shift to shoppers buying their movies and albums over the internet.

Now the nation’s last specialist record and CD retailer has been forced to call in the administrators.

EMI, the record company which signed The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Coldplay and which owned HMV until 1998, has already been sold to foreign buyers and broken up.

Very soon the only place where record store shops still exist will be online.

Harlequin records and tapes had branches throughout London and the Home Counties

Bygone era: Independent records stores such as robins records in Norwich are a thing of the past

Changing times: Keith Prowse records is another High Street chain to go under when buying records in stores gradually became replaced by online downloads

Punk rockers: Stiff Records was founded in 1976 and was best known for its punk rock music. But as the punk rock era passed, so did the record label's popularity and it closed in 1985

Long history: The nation's last specialist record and CD retailer - HMV - has gone into administration almost 100 years since it was first founded in 1921
