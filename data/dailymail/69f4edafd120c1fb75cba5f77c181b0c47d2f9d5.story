Blow: George Osborne's austerity policies have again been called into question after public borrowing rose last month

George Osborne is drawing up plans for ‘nuclear’ spending cuts this autumn after ‘terrible’ borrowing figures showed the country has plunged deeper into the red.

The Chancellor has resisted calls to draw up a Plan B for the economy, but senior civil servants say the Government is working on ‘Plan C’ to prevent a multi-billion-pound black hole opening in the public finances.

Official figures showed the Government borrowed £557million last month as a dramatic slump in tax receipts and a surge in spending on benefits punctured the Chancellor’s economic plans. The grim news sent shockwaves through the City and Westminster, where experts had predicted a surplus of £2.5billion.

The national debt soared to £1.03trillion – or more than £41,000 per household – compared to £940billion a year ago and less than £400billion a decade ago. Senior Treasury officials admitted that could mean further spending cuts in November’s autumn statement.

Mr Osborne is planning to announce a major housebuilding programme when Parliament returns next month. As well, the Government may reform the Highways Agency so it can borrow money to spend on roads, boosting the economy and reducing congestion.

The agency, which runs the network of 
motorways and A-roads, could be made a government-owned company or 
public trust, allowing it to borrow large amounts without increasing the
public deficit. Earlier this year the Government suggested plans to 
privatise roads, creating new tolls roads and ‘Lexus lanes’, where 
wealthy motorists can pay to beat jams.

Whitehall officials say the Treasury 
has told Government departments to prepare a fresh round of savings. One
senior civil servant said: ‘The ideas being kicked around are the kind 
of unmentionable economies that would make your eyes water.

‘The Treasury is reaching for the 
nuclear bunker plans to deal with a liquidity crisis. There simply isn’t
enough money coming in.

‘You will see the kind of cuts that they have had to push through in Ireland and Greece. Nothing is off the table.

‘This isn’t Plan B. We already have a 
Plan B and it isn’t working. That was to get the banks lending and move 
on big infrastructure projects. It’s not  happening. Now we’re into Plan
C territory, which means more retrenchment.’

Staying the course: The Treasury said today it must stick to its guns on cuts but critics have called on the Chancellor to adopt a plan B

Senior Treasury officials say the full
picture won’t be clear until October, when the independent Office of 
Budget Responsibility delivers a critical ruling that will determine 
whether the Treasury has to borrow billions more or take an axe to 
public spending. A source close to Mr Osborne said: ‘We won’t know the 
full situation until October’, and added: ‘The Treasury always prepares 
contingency plans.’

In a fresh blow to Mr Osborne a new 
ComRes poll for ITV News at Ten showed confidence in the Chancellor at 
an all-time low. Just 16 per cent of voters trust him to see the country
through the current crisis against 62 per cent who do not trust him.

Yesterday’s figures also provoked a 
renewed bout of sniping from Liberal Democrats, many of whom want to see
the Chancellor change course. Lord Oakeshott, the party’s former 
Treasury spokesman in the Lords, called on the Government to stimulate 
the  economy with ‘two real big bazookas’ – a housebuilding programme 
and measures to get banks lending again.

He said: ‘I’m afraid just firing off 
scattergun shots at the target won’t work. We are in danger of slipping 
down into a sort of vicious cycle, whereby no growth then means the 
deficit gets worse, then people talk about cutting again. That really 
would be self-harm.’

Yesterday’s figures were particularly 
worrying because July is usually a bumper month for the public finances –
there was a surplus of £2.8billion last year, meaning the State repaid 
rather than borrowed money.

But tax receipts were 0.8 per cent 
lower than a year earlier while government spending rose 5.1 per cent. 
Benefits payments jumped 6.2 per cent.

And in another blow to ministers, the 
Institute of Directors blasted the ‘ineffective’ government. Economist 
Graeme Leach said: ‘Business is battening down the hatches in the 
expectation that the recession will continue for the rest of the year. 
Low confidence leads to delayed decisions, and delayed decisions further
undermine economic confidence – it’s a vicious cycle.

‘If the Coalition wants to break this cycle of low economic confidence, then they need to take some bold steps.’

Labour Treasury spokesman Rachel 
Reeves said: ‘This is a damning indictment of a Chancellor who promised 
to secure the recovery and get the deficit down. His failed plan has 
delivered the exact opposite.’

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government remains committed to the credible plan we have set out to deal with Britain’s debts.'
