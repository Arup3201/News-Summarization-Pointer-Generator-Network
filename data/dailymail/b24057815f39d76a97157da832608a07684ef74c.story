A man tried to hang himself from the fence which runs along the border between Mexico and the U.S.

The U.S. Border Patrol said one of its agents spotted the man carrying a rope as he scrambled from the Mexican side of the fence into Calexico, California.Â 

As the agent approached, the man wrapped the rope around his next before dropping over the U.S. side of the fence and hanging himself.

The unnamed man had been trying to cross the border fence at Calexico, California, when he was spotted

The Border Patrol said in a news release that the agent grabbed the man by his legs and lifted him to try to stop the rope from choking him to death.

Another agent arrived to help and the rope eventually unravelled from the spot it was secured to, allowing them to lower him to the ground.

He was not breathing, but one of the agents was able to revive him and they monitored him until an ambulance arrived to take him to the Calexico Regional Medical Centre.

The incident happened at about 7pm on Sunday evening. The man's name has not been released, but the border patrol did say he was a 27-year-old Mexican citizen.
