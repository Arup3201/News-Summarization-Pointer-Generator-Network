Teenager Rose Farley, 15, from Liverpool, who died after claims her drink was spiked at a social club

A teenage girl collapsed and died in a suspected drugs overdose with friends claiming her drink was spiked with ecstasy, it has emerged.

Rose Farley, from Liverpool, fell ill at
a birthday party on Friday evening and died at Alder Hey Children’s 
Hospital during the early hours of  Saturday morning.

The 15-year-old's death comes just days after police warned youngsters of a deadly ecstasy-type drug circulating in the area.

Two teenage boys were arrested in connection with the incident yesterday but have been released on unconditional bail today.

A 16-year-old boy from Kirkdale, Liverpool was arrested on suspicion of supplying drugs and a 17-year-old from Everton was later arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and supplying 
controlled drugs.

Inquiries are still ongoing and police are appealing for information.

Friends of Rose yesterday hit out at the ‘twisted minds’ of the people or person who they claimed had secretly put the deadly drug into her drink.

Rose, described as ‘gorgeous and bubbly’, collapsed after spending the evening at a friend’s birthday party in a social club.

The teenager was taken by ambulance from her home in Liverpool to hospital but she died shortly afterwards at 5am.

Friends said she first became ill at the Silvestrian Social Club near her home in the West Derby area of the city.

Several messages were posted on social-networking sites with one user writing that he hoped the people responsible ‘get caught’.

One woman wrote: ‘I don’t know what goes though sick little twisted minds to spike a young girl. Low-lives. Heart goes out to her family and friends. I hope everyone who finds it clever and smart to take drugs in the first place stops.’

Rose’s parents, Chris and Lyn Farley, are divorced. Mr Farley, a former nightclub owner, has occasionally worked as a bodyguard to Liverpool and England captain Steven Gerrard. Mr Farley’s new wife, Kelly, is best friends with the footballer’s wife, Alex, and the two couples socialise regularly.

Police are investigating Rose Farley's death after claims her drink was spiked at a party on Friday

Rose’s death comes days after 
Merseyside Police issued a warning about a new strain of dangerous 
ecstasy-type tablet being distributed in the North West.

Officers advised people against taking
the potentially fatal pink pills, which are known on the street as pink
ecstasy, Dr Death or Pink McDonalds. The warning came after the deaths 
of two men in 24 hours in Cambridgeshire last week. A man died in 
similar circumstances in Bournemouth on May 21.

The last internet messages posted by 
Rose showed how much she was looking forward to her night out. On 
Friday, the schoolgirl tweeted: ‘Aw, dead excited for tonight.’

Thousands have viewed a tribute page on Facebook to the popular teenager with many leaving tributes following her tragic death

Joyce Hale, manager at the social club
said: ‘Everything was OK on the night and there were no problems. We 
only found out later on what had happened.’

Officers said they were aware of the 
claims that Rose’s drink was spiked at the party, but were still 
treating her death as unexplained.

Detective Superintendent Tim Keelan, 
of Merseyside Police, said: ‘At this stage it is too early to draw 
conclusions about the cause of death and it is unhelpful to speculate. 
The implication that this may be drug related is just one of the lines 
of inquiry that our comprehensive investigation is looking at.’

A post-mortem examination has been carried out but its immediate results were inconclusive. Toxicology test results are awaited.

More than 4,500 Facebook users have viewed a tribute page set up in her memory.

People have left 
emotional tributes to the teenager and floral tributes have been tied to the entrance of North Liverpool 
Academy, the school she attended.
