A man accused of carrying out attacks on five separate public places had a crossbow and hundreds of rounds of ammunition stored at his house.

Hong Young chose his targets at random with the first attack taking place at Arundel Mills mall, Maryland, on February 24, police said.

The 35-year-old, from Beltsville, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with attempted murder and assault after police spotted a 1999 Lincoln Town car linked to him near the site.

A man accused of firing at five public places in Maryland had a crossbow and hundreds of rounds of ammunition stored at his house

After searching his two-storey house they found ten weapons including several handguns. 

The mall shooting was the first of five attacks by Young in the last week. 

It involved a 61-year-old man who had the windows of his car shot out as he was driving through the shopping complex on February 24 around 7.30am.

The following Saturday the footage of the Lincoln Town car was released, according to the Baltimore Sun. 

But police were notified of a second shooting at a Walmart in Laurel on Monday.

That same day, cleaning crew staff reportedly heard gunshots around 5.10am at the AMC Theater in Columbia.

Tuesday, February 24, 7.30am: Arundel Mills shopping complex

Monday, March 2, early morning: Walmart in Laurel

Tuesday, March 3, 3pm: Intercounty Connector in Laurel

Tuesday, March 3, 5pm: National Security Agency in Fort Meade

On Tuesday a dump truck carrying two Nelson Tree specialist workers was travelling eastbound on the Intercounty Connector when it was struck by gunshots coming from a nearby wood.

The attack, which happened just before 3pm, left both passengers with injuries.

One was hurt by shattered glass and the other bruised from a bullet fragment, according to the Washington Post. 

Just two hours later the National Security Agency (NSA) in Fort Meade was targeted and several gunshots struck one of its office buildings.

No injuries were reported, a spokesman for the NSA told the Daily Mail Online.

A police spokesman said Young was being monitored at a nearby hospital under police guard.

Investigators will look into whether Young is tied to all five incidents spread across three different Maryland counties (above map showing where the shootings took place)

Police were searching for a grey or blue Lincoln Town car (above), which was spotted near some of the crime scenes. They believe it belongs to Young

He said: 'Clearly, he was continuing to do it until he got caught.

'This guy apparently has some other issues going on that our detectives continue to follow up on.' 

Young filed for divorce in September after nearly seven years of marriage, but the case was dismissed on Monday because his wife had not been served with documents in the case. 

Stephen Moyer, Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Secretary, said Young was a prison guard from January 2012 to May 2014.

Surveillance videos captured the car (above) but did not determine the number plate or identity of the shooter

One attack involved the National Security Agency (NSA) in Fort Meade (above). There were no injuries to any staff, a spokesman said

He said: 'There was nothing significant about his employment. 

'He was assigned to one of the medium security facilities in Jessup. He resigned. There was nothing remarkable about his file.'

Investigators are working to determine a motive, but do not believe the shootings are terrorism related.

It is a case with chilling similarities to the DC sniper attacks of 2002 when John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo killed ten people from a hidden firing spot in the back of their blue Chevrolet Sedan.

But this time County Chief Timothy Altomare said everyone was 'alive and well'.

He said: 'Most of us here probably, in some way, shape or form, are aware of the events 15 years ago with the DC sniper case. 

'As soon as we started to hear about the possibility of this stuff being linked, we kicked every effort we had into overdrive.' 

The back-to-back shootings in Maryland on Tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 when a sniper, John Allen Muhammad (left) and his 17-year-old accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo (right), terrorized the Washington, DC area in a series of seemingly random shootings

Back-to-back shootings in Maryland on Tuesday sparked flashbacks to 2002 when a sniper terrorized the Washington, DC area in a series of seemingly random shootings.

Ten people were killed and three injured in the October 14 shootings, which authorities eventually connected to two perpetrators working in tandem.

John Allen Muhammad and his 17-year-old accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo started their spree in February 2002, with murders in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas and Washington State.

The cross-country spree resulted in the deaths of seven people and left seven injured.

It was only in October that they began to target the Virginia and Maryland areas immediately surrounding DC - earning the name the Beltway sniper attacks.

The attacks left DC residents afraid to leave their houses for weeks. 

People would be shot at random and from a distance, so were never confronted with the attacker.

But Muhammad apparently grew tired of the anonymity and started leaving behind objects at the crimes scenes including a Tarot card inscribed with the phrase 'Call me God'.

Muhammad and Malvo's reign of terror was finally brought to an end on October 24 when they were found sleeping in a car in Myersville, Maryland and taken into custody.

The following September, Muhammad went on trial for his crimes and was sentenced to death. 

His accomplice Malvo testified at his trial saying the two planned to shoot six people a day for 30 days - though that plan failed.

When Malvo went on trial, his attorneys painted him as being under the influence of Muhammad and therefore not as equal a partner in their crimes, which is perhaps the reason he received a lesser sentence of life in prison without parole.

Muhammad was executed by lethal injection on November 10, 2009.
