A young mother had to learn to eat and walk again just like her new baby after suffering a stroke at the age of 27.

Donna Watson suffered the massive stroke just five months after giving birth to her daughter Millie Alice, leaving her paralysed down the right hand side of her body.

She also lost her ability to swallow and her speech, hearing and vision were severely affected.

After the horrific incident, Miss Watson, of Peterlee, County Durham, had to be weaned on to pureed food alongside her daughter Millie and even had to re-teach herself to walk and use her hands.

But the young mother was determined to defy doctors and just three months after the stroke she walked out of hospital using a walking stick.

She is planning to be able to move unaided and walk down the aisle when she marries her fiancée Nicky King in July next year.

Now she is speaking out about her ordeal as part of World Stroke Day and warning that they could hit anybody.

Miss Watson had been watching cartoons with her daughter when she heard a bang in her head and began to feel sick and tired. She was rushed to hospital where she was found to have suffered a stroke 

Miss Watson, who has had to give up her job as a videographer, had been watching cartoons with her daughter, when she stood up to do some housework in February last year.

She explained: 'I heard a bang in my head and I started to feel sick and tired.'

She then was unable to put baby Millie into her Moses basket and only had the strength to put pillows around her daughter.

She then rang her fiancée Nicky, who rushed home from his job at the nearby Walker's Snack Foods factory and she was taken to hospital.

Miss Watson then spent three days at the University Hospital of Hartlepool before being transferred to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough in a critical condition.

There, medics discovered she had suffered three blood clots on the brain.

She added: 'I was just past the safety window of three-hour blood clot infection, all they could do was give me bloods and monitor me.'

Due to her paralysis, she could not be on her own with the baby for a year until she learned herself how to care for Millie with one hand.

'It was a lot of trial and error,' said Miss Watson, who is also step-mum to Lewis, 13, and Dylan King, 10.

'I don't want any other young mothers to be sitting there in hospital being so scared that they are unable to raise their child.

'It will get better.'

One in eight UK women wrongly believes a stroke could never happen to them, according to figures from The Stroke Association.

Around 30,000 women die from a stroke every year and it is the third leading cause of death in women in the UK.

Elaine Roberts, director of life after stroke services at the Stroke Association, said: 'Its extremely worrying that most women don't even have stroke on their radar.'

She said women of all ages can reduce their risk of stroke, including keeping blood pressure under control, regular exercise and stopping smoking.
