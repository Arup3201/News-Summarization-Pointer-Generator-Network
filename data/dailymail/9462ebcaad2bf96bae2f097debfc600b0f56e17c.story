Newcastle Falcons have signed Argentina prop Juan Pablo Orlandi from Bath.

The 31-year-old joined Bath from Racing Metro in February 2013, following five seasons with Italian club Rovigo.

Rugby director Dean Richards believes the 15-cap front-rower will boost Newcastle's squad depth next term.

'We're delighted to be able to bring a player of Juan Pablo's calibre into the club.

'Over recent months we've seen a number of front row players unavailable for selection due to injury and international duties, and to be able to add Juan Pablo to our options in that area provides us with greater depth on either side of the scrum.

'Juan Pablo is a strong guy who has already proven he can make an impact at the highest level, and we look forward to integrating him into our side over the coming weeks.'
