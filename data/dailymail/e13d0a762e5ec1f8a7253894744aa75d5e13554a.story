DANNY CIPRIANI

No English fly-half keeps defenders guessing quite like Cipriani. Be it a deft chip over the defence or an audacious dummy, he has the guts to try things that others won’t. His defence was called into question as a youngster, but a grounding experience with Sale has improved that area of his game. If Stuart Lancaster is looking to add spark with a second-half replacement, then Cipriani ticks all the boxes.

Strength: Attacking spark

Weakness: Goal-kicking

Danny Cipriani will provide Stuart Lancaster's side with plenty of attacking spark

GEORGE FORD

Ford  is beginning to deliver on the potential that saw him named IRB Junior World Player of the Year in 2011. Alongside Cipriani, the 21-year-old is England’s second most attack-minded option, but is much more consistent. His spatial awareness and willingness to run at defenders creates chances. Kicking from hand is world class.

Strengths: Goal-kicking, vision

Weakness: Inexperienced

George Ford is a strong goal-kicker, but the 21-year-old lacks experience at the top level

OWEN FARRELL

The Saracens youngster is very good at managing the game from outside-half, but he does not have attacking instincts of Ford and Cipriani. If England are planning to stick to rigid patterns and set-plays Farrell is an effective middle-man, who also brings a good goal-kicking rate when under pressure. Club form has been hit by injuries and Charlie Hodgson’s form.

Strengths: Composure, defensive management

Weakness: Lack of spark

STEPHEN MYLER

Mr Consistent for top-of-the-table Northampton, Myler brings a cool head as he pulls the strings. But despite his continual inclusion in the England set-up, Myler  has made little impact on match-day squads. Not a player who scares the likes of New Zealand, South Africa and Australia.

Strength: Experienced

Weakness: Conservative 

Stephen Myler's form has helped Northampton top of the Premiership table, but he can be conservative
