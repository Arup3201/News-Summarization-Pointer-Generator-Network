Riccardo Montolivo has been putting his injury woes behind him by spending time on holiday in Miami with his wife Cristina de Pin.

The highly-rated midfielder spend time away from his native country Italy as he soaked up the sun on Miami Beach in Florida.

The AC Milan captain is currently recovering from a broken leg suffered during a friendly against the Republic of Ireland in May.

As a result the Italy international was ruled out of the World Cup, which understandably came as a huge blow to his country.

The 29-year-old's presence was sorely missed in the middle of the park as they exited the tournament at the group stages.

Montolivo will be featuring for a new manager when he does return to action for the Italian giants with club legend Filippo Inzaghi replacing Clarence Seedorf at the helm in June.
