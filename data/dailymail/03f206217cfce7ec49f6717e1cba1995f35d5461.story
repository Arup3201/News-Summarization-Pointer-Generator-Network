Troubled star Paul Gascoigne has been spotted shuffling out of his local off licence in a pair of slippers and sporting a new beard.

The former England footballer, who was briefly sectioned after an apparent alcohol binge in October last year, kept a carrier bag hidden as he emerged from a branch of Oddbins in Poole, Dorset.

Wearing an oversized sheepskin coat, yellow t-shirt and jeans, he appeared to be a healthier weight after being pictured looking painfully thin last year.

The father-of-three, 47, has long been battling alcoholism and has checked into rehab seven times during his fight with drink and drugs after repeatedly falling off the wagon.

In a photograph taken over the Christmas holidays, the 47-year-old looked fuller-faced and jovial as he posed with his sister Lindsay's three children, Lauren, Cameron and Joe.

The former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, who was  capped 57 times for England, spent the festive season with his family near Newcastle, before returning to his home in Sandbanks. 

Gascoigne admitted in November last year that ‘the only person who can save me is me’, and vowed to stay on the straight and narrow after listening to doctors' warnings that alcohol will kill him.

He was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.

The football icon continues to be supported by his close friend and rumoured girlfriend Mandy Thomas, 44, who has stood by his side throughout the last few turbulent months. 

Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, is said to have been sticking to an exercise regime and making regualr trips to the gym. 

In November last year, he spoke about his ongoing battle with booze in a TV interview.

The former midfielder, seen playing for Tottenham Hotspur in 1988, made 57 appearances for England

He admitted to This Morning presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes that he 'knew he was in trouble straight away' after his most recent relapse.

He said that he wasn't in a 'massive state', but admitted that it was enough 'to get himself into trouble'.

It has also emerged that an Oscar-nominated production team is said to be keen on the idea of basing a film around the former footballer's life.

According to the Daily Star, early indications suggest that producers are considering calling the movie Gazza - British Raging Bull, and it will follow his playing days and his battle with drink.

Gascoigne is said to be aware of the film plans and has even suggested that actor Sean Bean plays him.
