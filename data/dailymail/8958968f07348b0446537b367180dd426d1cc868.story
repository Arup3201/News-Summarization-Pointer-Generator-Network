A fossil hunter found himself caught between a rock and one very hard face after discovering this mysterious carving glowering out from a boulder that had fallen from the top of a cliff and landed on a Scottish beach.

Phil McInroy, from Dundee, found the creepy-looking carving on the side of the rock while searching for fossils close to St Andrews East Sands beach.

The 31-year-old immediately contacted Fife Council and their archaeologist Douglas Spiers confirmed there was no record of the carving.

Mr McInroy said that he only spotted the face in the rock after noticing it in a photo he had taken.

He explained: 'I was just walking along the beach getting photos looking towards St Andrews.

'I was having a look at one of the photos and saw what looked like a face in the rock, I thought I was maybe seeing things.

'Initially
 I thought it was a formation in the rock, maybe something natural, but 
when I looked closer I realised it was man made.

'I was looking closely at the rock and suddenly realised I could see a face staring back at me. It's lifesize and quite abstract but covered in lichen and moss, so it blends in with the other rocks.

'I wanted more information so got in contact with the council. They sent someone out to look at it as they had no record.

'I was really surprised when I found it, it is not something you would obviously see unless you're looking for it.

'It has now been added to the Fife Sites and Monuments record. It is not the sort of thing you find everyday, maybe I'll be the next Indiana Jones.'

Curiously, this is the second 
carved face reported to the Archaeological Unit in the last year. The 
other was at the foreshore at Kinghorn and also considered to be 
relatively modern.

Fife Council's archaeologist Mr Spiers 
believes the face could have been carved in the last 40 years, but said 
it was a feature of interest and beauty.

Douglas Spiers, Fife Council's resident archaeologist, believes the face could have been carved in the last 40 years but said it was a feature of interest and beauty

Mr McInroy said that rock in the area was a soft red sandstone which can erode rapidly when exposed, giving a false impression of antiquity.

He said: 'I can only suggest this was a rock that possibly already had some features which suggested a human face to persons unknown, who then enhanced them by some rudimentary carving of the soft stone.

'The face is actually carved on a large detached boulder that has fallen from the cliffs bordering the foreshore.

'Cliff
 falls are a reasonably frequent occurrence along this part of the St 
Andrews coast, indeed, only a little further along from the carving is 
another cliff fall that occurred only a few months ago.

'The
 fact that the face is in its correct attitude would almost certainly 
preclude the carving having been on the rock prior to it having tumbled 
to the shore and, therefore, it must have been carved in sit since that
 event.'

'My feeling is this is the work of a modern artist who saw an opportunity and just started carving.'

Mr McInroy has also investigated another case in recent years on the Isle of May, where it turned out to have been carved by an archaeologist in his spare time while he was working on the island in the 1903, and the discovery of a 'Pictish' carving on a rockface at Falkland, which was actually the skilful work of a modern artist.
