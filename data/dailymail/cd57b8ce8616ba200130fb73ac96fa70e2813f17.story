Dunkin' Donuts has added a couple of new hot items to its menu to help ease customers through the winter months.

The company announced on Monday that it will immediately start selling chocolate croissants and bagels topped with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and herbs at select restaurants.

The chocolate croissant features flaky croissant dough and a chocolaty filling, while the Tomato Mozzarella Supreme Bagel is a plain bagel with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and herb topping.

Both items are best served hot, and will be on the menu until some undisclosed point in 2015. Dunkin’ wouldn’t specify which restaurants will be sell the new items.

The company also said on Tuesday that it is conducting a special New Year's themed Twitter sweepstakes among followers of its Twitter page until Wedesnday

Winners can receive a year’s worth of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee or a $100 gift card to the store. 

The new eatables are the first to be added to the company's menu since it announced in October that was rolling out a croissant-doughnut hybrid. 

The chain launched its 'Croissant Donut' nationally for a limited time starting on November 3 and insisted that it wasn't anything like the infamous 'Cronut'.

The Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City introduced its now trademarked Cronut in 2013 and it quickly became a viral sensation that spawned numerous knockoffs.

Last summer, Dunkin' also introduced a croissant-doughnut in South Korea it dubbed a 'New York Pie Donut.'

John Costello, Dunkin's president of global marketing and innovation, said in a phone interview that bakers around the country have been mixing doughnuts and croissants for at least 20 years. He said Dunkin' is constantly tracking consumer and bakery trends and has been looking at pastry 'combinations' for several years.

'Are we copying a specific bakery in New York? The answer is no,' Costello said in a phone interview.

Dunkin' had reported disappointing quarterly sales in October and warning it might struggle to make its long-term growth targets for the financial year. 

Among the challenges the company is facing is increased competition, with chains including Taco Bell going after the breakfast crowd.

Dunkin', based in Canton, Massachusetts, has nevertheless been opening new U.S. locations and last week said it sees potential for more than 17,000 U.S. locations over time, up from its current 8,000.
