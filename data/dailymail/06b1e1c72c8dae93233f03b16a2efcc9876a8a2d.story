Sick online traders are promoting and selling memorabilia connected to convicted rapist footballer Ched Evans on eBay.

Signed shirts, match programmes and football cards are being touted to the highest bidder by sellers attempting to capitalise on Evans's notoriety.

Cynical traders are even using name to act as the unique selling point for goods which are not specific to him - a Sheffield United shirt signed by several players uses his name alone in the advert.

Sick opportunism: The Ched Evans Sheffield United away shirt recently sold for £60 on eBay, while a Norwich City card signed by the player has an asking price of £4.99

Evans, 26, served half of a five year sentence for the rape of a 19-year-old girl in Rhyl, North Wales, in 2011.

Since being released from prison, he has attempted to win a contract from a number of professional clubs without success.

Oldham Athletic pulled out of signing him this month after a public outcry and the club's board members receiving death threats. 

And with the footballer's career still in doubt, sick traders are taking advantage of the situation on eBay.

Sick: In perhaps the most cynical of selling tactics, one trader has used his name alone to advertise a Sheffield United shirt signed by a number of different players.

The items for sale include a programme from the player's last match between Sheffield United and Leyton Orient, dated April 14 2012 - selling for £2.99. 

A Sheffield United jersey with Ched Evans's name printed on the back sold for £60 just four days ago.

And a signed Norwich City card is also being advertised on the website, with an asking price of £4.99.

In contrast, another trader is offering 'No To Ched Evans' t-shirts for £13.99, which feature a circled 'Ched' with a red line through the name.

An appeal against Evans's conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

After his release, Evans released a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name.

Meanwhile, the website set up to defend convicted rapist Ched Evans has been referred to the police over a complaint by his victim's father that the footballer's supporters have identified her.

The Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC has also asked North Wales Police to look into whether evidence served during Evans' trial in 2012 has been dealt with 'properly'.

In Britain all sex attack victims are granted anonymity and it is a criminal offence to name them.

But the woman raped by Evans has been forced to change her name and move for a fifth time after being hunted down by vile internet trolls. 

New twist: A website set up to support Ched Evans, pictured with his fiancée Natasha Massey, will be investigated by police and prosecutors after a complaint it helps identify his victim
