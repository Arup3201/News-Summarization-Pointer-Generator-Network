Cardiff vs Bournemouth

Danny Gabbidon and Scott Young are set to take charge of their second game while temporarily at the helm, with Cardiff yet to sign a manager.

Fulham vs Doncaster

Fulham caretaker boss Kit Symons has brought smiles back to the club after replacing the unpopular Felix Magath, according to former player Danny Murphy.

Leyton Orient vs Sheffield United

Russell Slade takes his Leyton Orient side to Sheffield United with his own future up in the air after Orient rejected an approach from Cardiff to speak to him.

MK Dons vs Bradford

Bradford midfielder Gary Liddle is relishing being underdogs against MK Dons and believes they can beat them for a second time this season.

Bradford won 2-1 in a League One encounter a week ago and Liddle said: ‘It’s a case of can we repeat it? That’s the challenge. We know they are a good team and bounced back from the defeat against us by putting six past Crewe. 

'It’s another big test for us and we’ll go into the game as underdogs again — exactly the same as last Tuesday — and we’ll relish it.’

He said: ‘It’s going to be a tough game, but we’ll make it tough for Norwich... I believe in my players and that they can operate against these kind of outfits.’
