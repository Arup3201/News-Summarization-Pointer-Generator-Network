Former Major League Baseball player Chad Curtis is facing up to 15 years in prison after he was convicted Friday of ‘inappropriate touching’ involving three girls – all of them minors.

Curtis, 43, was convicted Friday in a Michigan court room after a week-long trial during which all three of the girls, two of them only 15 at the time of the indiscretions, took the stand and testified about his conduct with them last year in the weight room of a high school where he was a volunteer coach.

The two-time World Series champion was set to become the school’s head football coach last fall, but resigned when the allegations were made public.

Despite being described by defense witnesses as a man of ‘high moral character,’ the Grand Rapids Press reported, the girls’ detailed accounts and no-nonsense testimony did the former Yankees outfielder in.

‘We give these young ladies so much credit for their courage,’ Barry County Prosecutor Julie Nakfoor-Pratt told the paper. ‘It took a lot of courage to testify.’

Curtis was first accused of inappropriately touching the buttocks of two female students, both 15 at the time of the incidents as recent as April 2012, while he was the volunteer strength and conditioning coach at Lakewood High School, according to reports.

A third student, 16, then came forward and said Curtis touched her private areas and kissed her breasts the previous summer.

‘It appears as if [the victims] left quite a strong impression with the jury,’ the prosecutor told the Press. ‘They were unequivocal about what happened to them.’

This week’s trial resulted in a guilty verdict, pleasing his victims, according to the Press.

‘This has been such a long road for them,’ Nakfoor-Pratt told the paper, adding that ‘this is a step in the healing process for them.’

The conviction came despite a female massage therapist testifying on the defense’s behalf that she didn’t think it was ‘unusual to massage the area around someone's butt in a full-body massage,’ the Press reported.

While that may have explained two of the occurrences, the massage therapist didn’t address the third girl’s accusations.

‘It definitely was not therapeutic touching,’ said the prosecutor.

Curtis played 10 seasons during his big league career. First coming up with the then-California Angels in 1992, the outfielder then moved on to the Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and Texas Rangers. Curtis won two World Series rings with the Yankees in 1999 in 2000 – famously hitting a game winning walk-off home run in the 10th inning of game three of the 1999 World Series, his second of the game.

Curtis retired from professional baseball in 2001 at the age of 32.

The soon-to-be convict was previously athletic director at another school district before being dismissed for reasons unknown, which Curtis explained as differences with the administration.

When the allegations were first made public, the devout Christian asked his community to pray that the case ‘would be resolved in a way that is honoring god.’

He faces up to 15-years in prison at his September 26 sentencing.
