The broadcasting regulator is proposing tighter controls on television subtitles in a bid to stop the screening of inaccurate and often laughable live captions.

Errors appearing at the bottom of the screen have included describing Labour leader Ed Miliband as 'Ed Miller Band' and calling the head of the Church of England, 'Arch bitch of Canterbury'.

Ofcom highlighted two funny blunders - singer Engelbert Humperdinck was  'engle Bert humper distinct' on ITV's Loose Women and a BBC weather report referred to 'fox patches'.

Subtitled: Millions of TV viewers use subtitles like this scene from the BBC soap EastEnders, but now Ofcom is demanding tighter controls by broadcasters to avoid inaccuracies

Mistaken names: Ed Miliband was described in the live caption as 'Ed Miller Band' and the Church of England leader was given the title, Arch bitch of Canterbury'

BBC bosses were left red-faced again when a reporter visiting a farm spoke of how the pigs 'love to nibble anything that comes into the shed, like our wellies.

The subtitles alongside the report changed the last word to 'willies' and the mistake became an internet sensation when a viewer pictured the screen blunder.

During the Queen Mother's funeral, the words 'We'll now have a moment's silence for the Queen Mother' became "We''ll now have a moment's violence for the Queen Mother'.

The increase in errors has been partly blamed on the replacement of
stenographers  by 're-speaking', in which a 
person repeats what is said into a computer with voice recognition 
software.

Wrong TV subtitles: At her funeral the words, 'there will now be a moment's silence for the Queen Mother became 'there will now be a moment's violence for the Queen Mother' and  Engelbert's name was given as 'Engle Bert humper distinct'

Most of the errors on the 70 channels 
that now carry subtitles leave the hard-of-hearing 
baffled by some of  the live captions.

Ofcom found that 7.6 million people have used subtitles, including 1.4 million with hearing impairments, according to the Times.

Earlier research by the regulator found that viewers with hearing problems watched much more television than those without.

Apart from the mistakes, the biggest problems were delays in the appearance of subtitles and freezing of the live captions.

Ofcom, who consulted Action on Hearing Loss, the National Association of Deafened People and other bodies, have proposed that broadcasters should report back on the quality of their subtitles, every six months.

They also want the companies to delay live programmes briefly to improve subtitling.
