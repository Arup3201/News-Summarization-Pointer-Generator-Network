The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence today demanded the Metropolitan police chief take 'decisive action' after a damning report found officers spied on her family.

Baroness Lawrence has urged Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to co-operate fully with the judicial inquiry ordered by the Home Secretary following the Ellison review's 'devastating' revelations, in a letter seen by the BBC.

The call comes as it emerged Stuart Lawrence, Stephen's brother, said he should take part into the probe into police handling of the case.

Aspiring architect Stephen was murdered by racists at the age of 18 in Eltham, south-east London, in April 1993.

Decisive action: Baroness Doreen Lawrence (left) has today called for Met Police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (right) to take 'the relevant and appropriate action' against those named in a damning report, which found officers spied on her family in the wake of the murder of her son Stephen in 1993

It took nearly 20 years for two of the gang of up to six killers to be brought to justice.

A report by barrister Mark Ellison QC published this week found that one of the officers on the original investigation into his death, detective sergeant John Davidson, may have acted corruptly.

It was claimed that Davidson had admitted having a 'corrupt connection' with Clifford Norris, the gangland boss father of David Norris, who was finally convicted of Stephen's murder in 2012.

An undercover officer also passed on personal details concerning the Lawrence family, such as comments on the separation of Stephen's mother and father Doreen and Neville, the review found.

In the letter, Baroness Lawrence is said to have called on Sir Bernard to take 'the relevant and appropriate action' against individuals identified in the Ellison review.

She has asked for a personal undertaking from the Met police commissioner that he and the force 'will fully co-operate with the continuing enquiries the home secretary referred to in her oral statement to the House of Commons as well as the judge-led public inquiry she has ordered', the BBC reported.

The letter concluded: 'It goes without saying that the revelations in the review have been a devastating blow to Mrs Lawrence and her family.

'Any confidence that Mrs Lawrence had in your organisation has been shattered. Nothing short of immediate and decisive action by you will begin to help build the trust needed to go forward.'

Her son Stuart told the BBC: 'I reserve judgement until I hear who he's tried to employ to try to do this job and I wouldn't mind being part of the team myself to ensure the job is done.

'I'm a bit sceptical and reserved about apologies if that's all they are because they are just words.

'I want to see something done,' he added.

Sir Bernard said yesterday he would 'assist in any way possible' with any investigation into the claims. He plans to appoint an independent investigator to search Met archives to try to find any available evidence for the public inquiry into undercover policing.

Commander Richard Walton has been temporarily removed from his job as head of the Met's counter-terrorism command SO15 following the publication of Mr Ellison's report.

It revealed that an undercover officer - known as N81 - held a meeting in 1998 with Mr Walton, who was then an acting detective inspector working on Scotland Yard's Lawrence review team, responsible for making submissions to the Macpherson Inquiry.

That inquiry was conducted in the late-1990s to look at the way the police had originally investigated the murder of Mr Lawrence.

N81 infiltrated a group in the late 1990s, which then sought to influence the Lawrence family campaign to further its own agenda, the Ellison report revealed.

The head of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), Dame Anne Owers, has apologised to the Lawrence family for the police watchdog's part in prolonging the 'family's search for the truth'.

Following the report's publication on Thursday, Baroness Lawrence fought back tears in the House of Lords as she said her family had gone through '21 years of struggle'.

She said she had always believed that there was corruption in the police investigation into her son's murder and was on the verge of breaking down as she made an emotional statement.

The Labour peer said: 'When we embarked on the corruption case - because I knew there was always something and it was very difficult to convince other people around me, especially other police officers and even at times the Home Secretary - I believed that there was corruption at the start of Stephen's case.

'It's taken over a year for that (Mark Ellison's review) but it's taken nearly 21 years since Stephen's been killed, and the fact that we as a family had to go through all this and still there's more to come out.'

She added: 'It's been 21 years of struggle and no family should have to do that.'
