This time last year Andros Townsend was on the verge of something big.

Handed his senior England debut by Roy Hodgson in October 2013, the Tottenham winger scored a rasping shot from 25 yards against Montenegro which all but guaranteed the Three Lions’ place at the 2014 World Cup.

That strike against Montenegro was voted the fans’ favourite of England’s qualifying campaign.

0 - assists

(Towsend's only goal this season came for England against San Marino) 

He was a regular under then Spurs boss Andre Vilas-Boas, a marauding presence on the wing, reminiscent of a certain Gareth Bale who’d just moved to Real Madrid for a record £87million.

Since then, his star has faded. The hype stalled. An ankle injury hindered the 23-year-old from ever reaching Brazil.

And this season the regular outings at White Hart Lane have become numbered under Mauricio Pochettino.

All of Townsend's Premier League appearances this season have come from the bench

He was ruled out for 10 weeks with ligament damage less than two months before the World Cup began and, with that dream shattered, his luck in north London hasn’t improved since.

Townsend has become an unfortunate bit-part player for Tottenham, featuring for just 108 minutes in four Barclays Premier League appearances, starting none.

He has fallen down the pecking order at White Hart Lane with Nacer Chadli, Erik Lamela, Christian Eriksen and now Ryan Mason preferred by Pochettino.

‘Hopefully, with a few more games in the Europa League and the cup games, I might be ready to challenge for a Premier League spot,’ Townsend says.

More than a month has passed since he uttered those words, and the winger remains another young English player struggling to establish himself.

It is not entirely dissimilar to the treatment of England Under 21 striker Harry Kane. Pochettino doesn’t fancy either in his Premier League starting XI, and so whets their appetites in the Capital One Cup and Europa League.

Townsend is poised to take to that role once more in Greece on Thursday evening when Tottenham face Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League, and will be keen to score his first goal of the season for the club.

The competition is arguably Pochettino’s best chance of qualifying for the Champions League, with the winner being gifted a place among football’s elite next year.

From playing in front of 84,000 fans at Wembley to about 8,000 in Tripolis, though, can prove frustrating.

Last year he was battling with Raheem Sterling and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for his right to be in the England team, now he is warming the bench most Saturdays.

Jan Vertonghen said in October 2013: ‘I never enjoyed it when he played on the right wing and I was at left-back (in training).

‘I was asking, “Why is this guy not playing every week, with this talent?"

‘I think Andros can be our new Gareth Bale.’

Harry Kane (far right) is another young Englishman struggling to get Premier League action for Tottenham 

He has not been able to settle at White Hart Lane, having been sent out on loan to nine different clubs since 2009.

The man that impressed down the right flank in between injuries last year must be beginning to feel his 15 minutes of fame have been and gone.

‘I’ve been out injured watching the Barclays Premier League and seeing everyone doing well,’ he said during a previous injury.

‘That just gives me an incentive to come back and to play even better than I was before.’

Chance would be a fine thing for the Young Lion, and less than 30 minutes here and there in the Premier League may not keep the still-young winger satisfied for long.
