A filmmaker who was hired to make a video promoting a new Hollywood movie spent the entire £15,300 ($25,000) budget on helping the victims of the Philippines typhoon.

Casey Neistat was asked to create an inspiring film to promote the Ben Stiller blockbuster, The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty.

Rather than make a traditional advertising film, Neistat flew to the city of Tacloban, which was devastated by last month's Typhoon Haiyan, and handed out more than 10,000 meals, bought using the budget.

Filmmaker Casey Neistat (centre) was hired to make a promotional video for the Ben Stiller movie The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty but spent the entire budget on providing aid to victims of Typhoon Haiyan

With permission from 20th Century Fox, he went to Philippines and bought thousands of meals for starving victims

With help from locals, they distributed the food parcels in the city of Tacloban, which was one of the worst affected areas

The inspiring video was filmed by Neistat and his friend Oscar using only a single camera and a tripod.

Neistat said the idea came to him when he was sent an email by producers 20th Century Fox, five days after the typhoon hit.

They asked him to create a film about chasing a dream that would inspire the viewer to do something they have never done. 

Neistat replied that the only film he wanted to make was to give away the budget to those in need - and they agreed.

His response to the email said: 'Here's my concept. Give me the budget and I will go to the Philippines and spend every penny helping people in need'.

The company agreed and within three days he and Oscar had landed in the Philippines and set about delivering relief.

The six minute promotional video was filmed using a single camera and a tripod so all the money could be spent on aid

They almost emptied a store of its contents before driving two hours to Tacloban with the goods

Neistat said: 'Mitty is a movie about chasing a dream and they wanted me to make a movie about chasing a dream.

'I am a big dreamer but at that time only one thing came to mind; if I could do anything in the world right now what would it be? That's to help the victims of the typhoon.'

They filmed themselves travelling to Tacloban on two hired passenger buses before delivering the food to hundreds of queuing people.

As well as the food, the budget stretched to tools for 35 villages and medical supplies.

The six minute video, called What Would You Do With $25,000?, has now been viewed more than 250,000 times on YouTube and a link has also been retweeted by the movie's star Ben Stiller.

More than 6,000 people were killed in the devastating typhoon, which hit the Philippines on November 8.

They then drove to Tacloban where thousands had been killed and tens of thousands had lost homes

More than one month later, 1,779 people are still missing and four million people are either homeless or living in damaged houses.

Power has been restored to just one per cent of Tacloban

Neistat said: 'Never have I met such people with the resilience of these typhoon victims.

'There was one thing that stuck out, one big huge tiny thing, that was of everyone we were face to face with, thousands of people, not once, at anytime for any reason did anyone complain - no one.

'Their focus was on rebuilding and healing, not sympathy.'

The budget stretched to 10,000 meals, tools for 35 villages and basic medical supplies
