A drug dealer has been jailed after police found Class A drugs stashed inside children's Kinder Surprise eggs at his home .

Police discovered 30-year-old Warren Christopher had concealed a large amount of the illegal class-A drugs inside the plastic containers that come with the children's treat.

Christopher was also found to have a gun and ammunition at his home in Epsom, Surrey during a raid in August.

He is now beginning a five-year prison sentence, after pleading guilty to seven drug and firearm offences, all committed which all breached a suspended sentence.

Officers searching his home found a number of drug wraps stuffed inside the yellow containers that hold the prizes contained inside the beloved children's chocolate egg.

More wraps were found in his bedroom as well as a handgun concealed in a sock, a large quantity of cash and ammunition.

The raid took place after police were tipped off by a suspicious local. 

Investigating officer Detective Constable Hannah Millyard said: 'This sentence demonstrates that when members of the public come forward with their concerns about illegal activity in their community, we will act.

'Drugs have a hugely damaging impact on people who use them and in turn on the neighbourhoods where they are used, with their use often leading to other criminal behaviour.'

Christopher was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court on Monday, after admitting two counts of possessing a class A drug with intent to supply, possessing a firearm without a certificate, and possessing a firearm when prohibited.

He was also sentenced for possessing ammunition without a firearm certificate, and two further counts of possessing class A drugs.
