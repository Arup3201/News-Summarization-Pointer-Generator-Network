A prisoner allegedly used a smuggled mobile phone to arrange for Parcelforce to deliver imported machine guns from Germany, a court has heard.

Alexander Mullings, 23, allegedly masterminded the operation from his cell at Wandsworth Prison by communicating with four co-defendants each time a weapon was dispatched by the delivery company.

The prosecution at the Old Bailey hinges on records from illicit mobile phones via numerous websites and apps including Instagram, Whatsapp, Youtube and even escort sites. 

Alexander Mullings, 23,  imported machine guns (pictured) from Germany and had them delivered by Parcelforce using a smuggled phone from his cell at Wandsworth Prison, a court has heard

Mr Mullings, who goes by the street name 'Smokey', has admitted organising drug deals from his prison cell.

He also admits co-ordinating the packages to help former girlfriend, Emily Ciantar, 20 - who is also on trial - pay off a £20,000 drugs debt owed to a violent gang lord referred to in court as 'Mr X'.

However, he claims that he thought the packages contained imitation firearms.  

Mr Mullings is standing trial alongside four other defendants - including Ms Ciantar - on joint charges of transferring machine guns and ammunition with intent to endanger life.

The court heard how three Skorpion sub-machine guns, two of which contained 74 and 100 bullets, were intercepted by police between April and June last year.

But five other lethal firearms delivered via Parcelforce to north London have not been recovered, the court was told.

Seven of the eight parcels were delivered to a house in Finsbury Park, which was occupied by 55-year-old Joseph Macgillivray.

Mr Macgillivray, a drug addict, claims that he thought the packages contained pornography and that he was collecting them from a friend to save him from embarrassment.

One of the sub-machine guns was seized by police during a dramatic firearms raid in April in Mitcham.

The trial comes as proposed new legislation by the Ministry of Justice and Home Office discussed in Parliament this week could see phone networks compelled to cut off mobile phones being used by prisoners.

Detective Inspector Matthew Husher said it had become more difficult for prison staff to prevent mobile phones being brought into prisons with some models matching the shape and size of a car key fob.

Prisoners' visitors have also been known to conceal Sim cards in their mouths.

In 2013, 7,451 illicit mobile phones were seized from UK prisons.

Speaking about the proposed new legislation, prisons minister Andrew Selous said: 'We will never tolerate the use of mobile phones in prisons and will continue to clamp down on their illicit use.

'Our range of tough security measures has already successfully seen the number of seizures increase, but this proposed new legislation will significantly increase our ability to tackle this problem.

'By ordering a phone to be cut off once it is identified, we will be able to reassure victims and prevent further criminal activity faster and wider than ever before.'

The prosecution claims it was delivered by Ms Ciantar to Spencer Inglis, 24, who intended to use it to endanger life.

Mr Inglis, who is in custody, has denied the allegations but declined to give evidence in court.

The recovered machine gun and ammunition carried fingerprints belonging to Sarah Anderson, 24, from Islington, who is also standing trial.

She is a known friend of Mr Mullings, who took him in for six weeks when he was hiding from police for a previous conviction.

She told the court she could not explain how her fingerprints came to be on the gun and ammunition and has denied all charges.

Delivering his closing speech yesterday, prosecuting barrister Benedict Kelleher presented a narrative of a team of trusted accomplices - most of whom were linked to Mullings by sex or drugs - who he used to run a lucrative business from his prison cell.

He said Mr X, whose real identity is known to police and barristers, was in fact another accomplice used by Mr Mullings to deal drugs and smuggle weapons.

He said: 'This was a conspiracy run by Mr Mullings to import machine guns and ammunition to be redistributed to those around London that wanted them.

'The one reason people want guns and ammunition is to be able to fire them at people and to endanger lives and that's why Mr Inglis took possession of that gun.' 

The jury is expected to reach a verdict later this week.
