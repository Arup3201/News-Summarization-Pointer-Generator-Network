The Saturday's singer Vanessa White will only have two days off from training over Christmas

Spare a thought for The Saturday’s singer Vanessa White as you tuck into another mince pie or piece of chocolate. 

After signing up with top catwalk agency Select Model Management, the pop star’s personal trainer, Giacomo Farci, is allowing her only two days off over Christmas. 

‘I train five times a week, doing kickboxing and cross-training,’ reveals Vanessa. 

‘I don’t want to let myself go and then have to frantically catch up in January, so I’ll be back at the gym on December 27.’

Vanessa’s kickboxing workout includes kicking pads and punching bags, and also squatting with weights to strengthen her legs. 

Let’s hope she doesn’t lose her temper on Christmas Day as her new skills could prove dangerous.

If you do overindulge at Christmas, make sure there’s a bowl of nuts to hand. 

They mop up bad cholesterol and lower the risk of heart disease, say researchers, who compared the health benefits of ten different types of nuts. 

Pistachios have the highest concentration of phytosterols, compounds that work in the intestine to lower the amount of bad cholesterol absorbed. 

Meanwhile, almonds, cashews, macadamias, hazelnuts and pistachios have the highest levels of monounsaturated fatty acids, which help reduce bad cholesterol levels in the blood.

Could whisky prevent cancer? 

A dram after dinner could be a real tonic – as long as it’s a certain type of whisky. 

Researchers found two whiskies from the island of Islay contain high levels of bromophenols, which have been shown to have antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-cancer effects.

A team from Hohenheim University in Germany carried out a range of tests and found two single malts – Laphroaig and Lagavulin – have bromophenols, which are also found in algae and shrimps. 

However, they were unsure how much would have to be consumed to experience any discernible health benefits. 

It's the present no one wants at this time of year. 

But the holiday period is the peak time for passing on flu, according to research – and it may be linked to the end of term time at schools and colleges.

The rates of infection in the third week of December are more than double compared with the previous two weeks, as well as in January, February and March. 

Scientists at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine looked at reports of flu-like illness in more than 4,000 people and the highest rates were found among those under the age of 18.

In the final last week of December, there was a rise in incidence among adults, suggesting that children had passed the virus on to their families.

Beware Christmas Tree Syndrome 

Not all sniffles during the festive period are down to colds – the same symptoms could be due to an allergy dubbed Christmas Tree Syndrome. 

Firs can carry allergens such as pollen from other plants on the bark, triggering hay fever. 

They can also collect mould on their trunks and needles which release spores, causing allergic reactions. 

And it’s not just real trees that can be a problem – artificial trees can also trigger allergies. 

If you have stored your tree since last year, it will have amassed a layer of dust that will be dispersed when it is disturbed.
