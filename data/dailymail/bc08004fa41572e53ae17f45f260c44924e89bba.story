Kid Rock is making sure his fans know exactly where he stands on the controversy surrounding box office champ 'American Sniper' with a profanity-laden tirade aimed at the film's critics. 

The Clint Eastwood film profiles Chris Kyle, a U.S. Navy SEAL who was described as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. 

While critical reviews have been generally positive and the movie has been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Actor, it has also drawn fire for being jingoistic or propaganda for the U.S. military.

Kid Rock is making sure his fans know exactly where he stands on the controversy surrounding box office champ 'American Sniper' with a profanity-laden tirade aimed at the film's critics

Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II

Actor Seth Rogen and filmmaker Michael Moore have been made controversial statements about the film on Twitter.

CBS Detroit notes that Kid Rock has responded in a post on his site titled 'AMERICAN SNIPER, MICHAEL MOORE AND SETH ROGAN (sic).'

Rock writes: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon.

'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.'

Rogen, the star and director of the almost-banned comedy The Interview issued a statement about this weekend's blockbuster hit American Sniper, comparing the Clint Eastwood-directed film to Nazi propaganda.

'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds,' Rogen tweeted on Sunday. 

Quentin Tarantino's Inglorius Basterds culminates with an assassination attempt on Adolph Hitler at the premiere of a fictional propaganda film called 'Stolz der Nation' which translates to Nation's Pride.

Rogen has since elaborated that just because he was reminded of the Tarantino scene does not mean that he was drawing any comparison between Kyle and Nazi, and that he even enjoyed the film

One of the characters of the film is a haughty German soldier who plays himself in Nation's Pride, a movie about how he killed 200 Allied soldiers from a clock tower in one battle. 

American Sniper on the other hand stars Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle, the real-life man who became the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, saving hundreds of American lives with at least 160 kills.

The film based off Kyle's memoir, ends with his tragic death in Texas, allegedly at the hands of a fellow soldier with PTSD he was trying to help.

Rogen isn't the first to criticize the film this weekend, during which American Sniper topped the box office and raked in a record $105.3million. 

Rogen has since elaborated that just because he was reminded of the Tarantino scene does not mean that he was drawing any comparison between Kyle and Nazi, and that he even enjoyed the film.

'But if you were having a slow news day, you're welcome for me giving you the opportunity to blow something completely out of proportion,' he added, on Twitter.

Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II.

Oscar-tipped: Clint Eastwood's movie is hotly-tipped to pick up a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Cooper. Meanwhile, Rogen's film The Interview was not eligible for any Academy Awards 

Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.'

Moore later backtracked those comments on Facebook, writing that he thought the film was well made but could have done a better job at contextualizing the Iraq War. 

American Sniper has been nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Actor for Cooper and Best Picture.

Seth Rogen's film The Neighbors was eligible for this year's Academy Awards, but was not nominated in any category.

Rogen's other film The Interview, nearly banned for fear that screenings of the North Korean-set comedy would be targeted by terrorists, was not eligible for the Oscars since it was released online a day before it premiered in theaters.
