Sgt Gibson was aged 34 when he was killed on October 18, 1940

His bravery in defusing a huge hissing bomb that fell on a factory during the Blitz earned him a George Cross after ordering his fellow engineers to take shelter.

But tragically, Sergeant Michael Gibson was killed along with his squad of six men a month later, when a live 550lbs bomb exploded as they were unloading it from a truck.

His wife and children actually saw the fatal explosion from a few miles away as they made their way to an air raid shelter.

Sgt Gibson was posthumously awarded the George Cross — the second highest award for gallantry after the Victoria Cross.

The immaculate silver medal was bought in the 1960s by a private collector and following his death it has now sold at auction for a world record £93,000.

An unidentified bidder purchased the medal for £78,000, though all the fees added on later bumped up the overall total.

The previous world record for a George Cross was £86,000 paid for one awarded to Corporal James Scully who saved a family trapped in the rubble of their home in Liverpool after being bombed.

Christopher Hill, of London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, which sold Sgt Gibson's medal, said: 'There is a growing appreciation for the George Cross, which is rarer than the Victoria Cross.

'They are equal in term of gallantry but in collectors' terms, the Victoria Cross has always been more desirable.

'The Victoria Cross is awarded for gallantry in the face of the enemy. The George Cross is generally awarded for cold-blooded gallantry, where you know beforehand the risk to life involved, as opposed to the Victoria Cross, which is in the heat of battle.'

Sgt Gibson, of number 9 Bomb Disposal Company, Royal Engineers, was charged with making safe UXBs and mines that fell in the Warwickshire area in 1940.

On September 14, 1940, he and his squad were sent to a factory in Coventry after a Luftwaffe raid left two UXBs in situ. While the area was being evacuated the first bomb went off, although nobody was hurt.

Sgt Gibson uncovered the second device under the rubble when he heard an ominous hissing sound coming from it. At this point, Sgt Gibson sent his men away and went to work on the fuse.

The citation for his award stated: 'His prompt and courageous action saved a very dangerous situation.'

Sgt Gibson was aged 34 when he was killed on October 18, 1940.

The squad of seven men had recovered a 550lbs bomb from Coventry city centre and took it to the remote Whitley Common where it was to be defused.

On unloading the bomb from their lorry, it exploded, killing all of the men. They were all buried in a collective grave in Coventry Cemetery.
