The pilot who safely navigated an emergency landing on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx on Saturday has been hailed as a hero, but he might have some explaining to do closer to home.

Michael Schwartz, 50, was carrying two female passengers when he ditched onto the highway, but his wife Giovanna was not on the plane. And she doesn't seem impressed with his antics.

'Why don't you ask him? I'm sure he would be happy to tell you,' she told Lohud when asked about his pleasure flight.

The pilot's wife told the site she only found out about the excursion on Saturday evening.

Drama: The plane that pilot Michael Schwartz daringly landed on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx is removed from the scene

Owner: The plane is registered to Michael Schwartz of South Salem, New York. But his wife wasn't on the plane and doesn't seem impressed with his exploits

Air traffic control tapes released on 
Sunday shed light into the cockpit as student pilot Schwartz navigated 
his broken plane into a dramatic emergency landing on the busy Bronx 
expressway.

Schwartz 
had taken out two passengers, named as Kristina Terrell, 43, and Monica 
Castillo, 20, for a trip around the Statue of Liberty on Saturday.

Then he encountered engine troubles on the way back to Danbury, Connecticut.

He
 called air traffic control around 3:20pm asking for guidance and 
remained levelheaded even when the controller didn't come up with a ton 
of options for possible landing areas.

'Mayday, mayday...we're losing engine power,' the pilot of the Piper Pa-28 says.

Owner: The plane is registered to Michael Schwartz of South Salem, New York. But his wife wasn't on the plane and doesn't seem impressed with his exploits

In the call he asks for a place to 
make an emergency landing, and the air traffic controller points out 
that La Guardia Airport in Queens is five miles away.

'I'll never make it, where do I touch down?'

At that point the air traffic controller struggles for a while to think up another option

'I'm
 not sure where you can touch down if you're not going to make it,' he 
says before throwing out the idea of Harlem River or Major Deegan.

He
 quickly changes his mind on landing on the Major Deegan however since 
its populated and points the pilot in the direction Van Cortlandt Park 
which is 1,100 acres. By then it was too late.

Only option: The air traffic controller suggested landing in Van Cortlandt Park, but Mr Schwartz was too far off

Shock: After safely landing the plane, Mr Schwartz reported back to Air Traffic Control that the plane was in surprisingly good condition

'I'm at less than 1,000 feet,' Schwartz said just as he landed on the freeway.

Mr Schwartz made the landing, saving himself and the two passengers and without hitting any of the cars on the freeway.

'Looks
 like we made a pretty good landing here,' he said once on the ground. 
'Looks like there isn't much damage to the aircraft at all.'

Witnesses were astounded as the plane made its shaky descent on the highway.

One quick-thinking maintenance worker rushed to help alerting cars to move out of the way as he saw the craft coming in.

'The propeller wasn't moving and it went down right over us,' Jarel Paul, who was driving along the road with friends, told the Daily News.

He added that as they spotted the plane, one of his friends was yelling: 'It's flying low, it's low.'
