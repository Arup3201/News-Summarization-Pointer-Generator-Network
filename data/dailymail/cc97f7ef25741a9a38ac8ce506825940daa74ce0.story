One in five children in some areas are shunning Nick Clegg's free school meals in favour of packed lunches, official figures reveal today.

Almost 300,000 four to seven-year-olds across the country are failing to claim their free meal amid concerns over the quality of lunches at some schools.

Take-up varies across areas and is as low as 81.5 per cent in the south east, according to a census of schools in October being released today.

The survey is the first indication of the impact of the Deputy Prime Minister's cherished £1billion policy of serving free meals to pupils in the first three years of primary school.

Take-up was expected to be 87 per cent but only three out of 10 English regions reached this level – the north east, the north west and inner London.

Across the country, 85 per cent of pupils claimed their free lunch – some 1.64million.

But 285,490 pupils – more than one in seven – preferred to take in their own packed lunch. The figure also includes an unknown number of pupils who were absent on census day.

Take-up was lowest in the south east, followed by the east of England, where 82.8 per cent took a free meal and the east midlands, where the figure was 82.9 per cent.

Ministers recently announced extra funding for kitchen renovations to help more schools cook hot meals on the premises instead of transporting them in.

Documents linked to the announcement reveal that some schools are transporting in at least 250 hot meals every day.

Meanwhile a row broke out in Birmingham earlier this term after reception pupils at some schools were revealed to have been offered just one chicken nugget at lunchtime, while Year One pupils got two.

The take-up figures emerged as Mr Clegg was challenged by academics who analysed the impact of free meals in two areas which ran a trial scheme of universal provision.

Mr Clegg has repeatedly hailed the trials – in Newham and Durham – as evidence that his policy will produce a range of specific benefits.

However the researchers – from the Institute for Fiscal Studies - said he was wrong to claim that healthy hot lunches can be better at raising pupils` results than many literacy and numeracy initiatives.

And they warned against assuming that results from the pilot schemes would be repeated across the country.

Senior Researcher Ellen Greaves said: 'We did find that offering free school meals to all pupils in primary schools lead to higher take-up of school meals, and improvements in…test results.

'On average, pupils in the pilot areas made between four and eight weeks' more progress over the two year pilot than similar pupils in comparison areas. But it is not clear from this evidence that these positive outcomes will be repeated in the roll out of free school meals to all infant pupils across the country.'

She added that the team 'found no evidence of significant differences in behaviour, health or nutrition'.

Steve Higgins, professor of education at Durham University, said the evidence for the scheme was 'very weak'.

But Mr Clegg was bullish yesterday as he visited a school in London to help with Christmas cooking.

'Well over a million and a half infants are enjoying a school meal at lunchtime, giving them a better start to afternoon lessons and a healthy boost for their first years in school,' he said.

'The other good news for families is that this saves them up to £400 per child a year on the cost of a packed lunch.

'The naysayers about this policy can eat their hats, and all the leftover sprouts.'

He insisted that only one per cent of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards that currently apply to school food.
