Wayne Routledge and Angel Rangel stuck the boot into Alexis Sanchez after Swansea came back to defeat Arsenal on Sunday. 

Sanchez showed his confidence on Twitter at 10.35pm on Saturday, posting a smiling image of himself with team-mates including Wojciech Szczesny and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, saying: 'Tomorrow those 3 points are coming to London #GUNNERS.'

Despite the Chilean scoring the opener, the three points stayed in Swansea and Routledge and Rangel were quick to remind him of the fact.  

Alexis Sanchez's tweet on the eve of their clash with Swansea was proven to be a poor prediction

Routledge couldn't help himself after the match, with the winger retweeting the comment and image with the simple jibe: 'Ermmmmmm...'

His team-mate Rangel also referred to the tweet following the win by putting it in quotation marks and three question marks after it.

He also tweeted: 'Seems like 3 points stay in Swansea. Great team performance again #SWANS'.

Their ridicule will have been more directed at the Arsenal team as a whole than Sanchez himself, who once again delivered for the Gunners with his sixth goal in four Premier League games.

Their lead, taken just after the hour mark, lasted just 12 minutes when Gylfi Sigurdsson delivered a outstanding free-kick. 

Bafetimbi Gomis then headed home the dramatic winner a matter of seconds after coming from the bench to replace Wilfried Bony.

The loss for Arsenal comes just five days after they blew a three-goal lead in the Champions League to Belgium's Anderlecht and now leaves them lagging 12 points behind leaders Chelsea.
