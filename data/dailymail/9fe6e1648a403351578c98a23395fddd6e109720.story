Nigel Farage said Ukip could see victory  next year as he hit the campaign trail for Tory defector Mark Reckless today.

The party leader looked confident as he spoke with voters in Rochester and Strood this morning after suggesting Ukip had 'enough momentum' behind it to sway the general election in May. 

Mr Farage, who faced criticism this week for saying HIV-carriers should not be allowed in Britain, added he would not consider a pre-election pact with the Conservative party.

'I think that Ukip's in a position now (where) we've got momentum behind us, we've shown we can win under first past the post,' he said. 

'An awful lot can happen in seven months for all of us, bu there is a possibility, if we get this right, that we could get enough MPs into Westminster next year to hold the balance of power and that is exactly where I'd like Ukip to be.'

The party leader was campaigning in Rochester and Strood on behalf of Mark Reckless, who announced his departure from the Conservatives at Ukip's party conference last month, triggering a by-election. 

He was the second MP to stray from Mr Cameron following Douglas Carswell's announcement to join Ukip in the summer. 

The MP for Clacton joined Mr Farage today where the party leader said he would target 'everybody' in his campaign next year.

Mr Farage added he 'didn't believe a word' David Cameron said and would not consider a pre-election pact with the Conservative Party 

'Let's make the people's army of Ukip march on Rochester and Strood,' he urged. 

Later, Mr Farage dismissed suggestions of agreeing on a pre-election pact with David Cameron. 

'If I was to call a silence and ask our activists here now whether they wanted a pre-election pact with the Conservatives I think I would need to be bundled into that room for my own safety.

'This party is not a splinter of the Conservative party. This party is its own organic force.

'We want to win our own representation in Westminster and we believe only by doing that can we fundamentally change British politics.

'To sell out so that one or two people can have ministerial positions is not what Ukip's about.

'I don't trust David Cameron. I don't believe a word David Cameron says and for that reason it would be fruitless to even enter into any negotiation.' 

The Conservatives have repeatedly told voters that backing Ukip splits the vote and would lead to a Labour victory.

But Mr Farage again insisted that the election of Mr Carswell in Clacton shows that support for the party is not a wasted vote.

He said: 'What we saw in Clacton was very clear. The people voted Ukip and they got Ukip.' 

Mark Reckless earlier spoke of backbench Tory MPs who he claimed were unhappy with their leadership. 

Speaking of his defection, he said he was a 'man of his word to the electorate'.
