Rick Perry sealed his position as GOP front-runner last night after he eased through his first presidential TV debate with a straight-talking and confident performance.

The Texas governor defied expectations he might falter on the national stage and batted off challenges from Mitt Romney on the economy, healthcare and social security.

Pulling no punches he repeated his controversial claims that social security is a 'Ponzi scheme', revealed that he backed the opening of Guantanamo Bay and won a huge round of applause for his staunch support of the death penalty.

Clearly the focus of the debate he at one point admitted to feeling like a 'Pinata' because he came under so many attacks.

But the big loser of the night was Michele Bachmann who faded as the debate went on and fared worse than even Newt Gingrich.

Having lost half of her support in 
recent weeks she now faces grave questions over whether she can mount a 
serious challenge - making it more likely than ever the contest is a 
two-horse race.

The debate, the second in the race to 
become the Republican presidential candidate, puts Perry in a strong 
position but also gave voters the biggest glimpse of his outlook.

He was combative and put forward the 
most coherent philosophy of all the candidates - including refuting the 
idea that mankind is behind climate change.

He also draw a clear line between 
himself and Romney on a range of issues and left the former 
Massachusetts governor looking defensive at times.

The audience at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, California did not have to wait long to see the pair clash.

The sharpest divide was over social 
security during which Perry said that it was a 'monstrous lie,' adding, 'It's a Ponzi scheme
to tell our kids that are 25 and 30-years-old today you're paying into
a programme that's going to be there.

'Anybody that's for the status quo with social security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids.

'I don't care what anyone says, we know that, the American people know that and those 25 and 30-year-old people know that.'

Romney however said he would do the opposite and vowed to save social security.

'You say that by any measure social security is a failure,' he said with a passion which has so far been lacking in his campaign.

'You can't say that to tens of 
millions of Americans who live on social security...our nominee has to 
be somebody who isn't committed to abolishing social security but is 
committed to saving social security.'

But in his rebuttal Perry came back 
and said: 'Maybe it's time to have some provocative language in this 
country and say things like let's get America working again and do 
whatever it takes to make that happen'.

The two men also disagreed over healthcare and spent the first seven minutes of the debate sniping about the economy.

In an exchange which went back and 
forth five times Romney made made a dig referring to Perry's links to 
former Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore.

But then Perry sniped: '(Former Massachusetts governor) Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt.'

As the crowd cheered Romney replied: 
'As a matter of fact George Bush and his predecessor at a faster rate 
than you did governor.'

As the debate wore on the audience 
warmed to Perry and even applauded when host Brian Ross read out the 
fact that 234 people had been executed by the state of Texas.

In a series of unapologetic answers he
laid out his philosophy on climate change – which he denied was 
definitely linked to mankind – and foreign policy.

In a clear reference to the Libyan 
invasion he said that the U.S. should not invade another country unless 
American interests were clearly at stake.

His comments on the death penalty, however, were his most blunt.

Outspoken: Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich (L) won a huge cheer for a bitter attack on Barack Obama while Governor of Utah Jon Huntsman (R) listened during the debate

He said: 'In the state of Texas, if 
you come into our state and you kill one of our children, you kill a 
police officer, you're involved in another crime and you kill one of our
citizens you will face the ultimate justice and that is you will be 
executed.'

The focus on the two men left the rest
of the candidates looking like bystanders, although Gingrich was better
than the last debate and won a huge cheer for a bitter attack on Barack
Obama.

The night's big casualty was Bachmann who looked tired and seemed to dry up as the debate went on.

She only won a moderate round of applause for her comments on the economy and for opposing the invasion of Libya.

Her support has crumbled in recent weeks from 16 per cent to eight per cent and she is now all but out of the race.

Speaking after the debate Eugene 
Robinson of the Washington Post said that Bachmann had 'dropped out of 
the first tier into the second tier.'

MSNBC political host Al Sharpton went further and said she had 'left the race tonight'.

Turning to Perry he said that the Texan's performance had 'fed red meat to his base'.

He added: 'I don't think Romney made any major mistakes. I was surprised he wasn't as rattled as he could have been'.

Political commentator Ed Schultz said that Perry did what his supporters wanted him to do by 'not backing down';

'This guy is solid in his philosophy and that's what helps in the right wing of the party,' adding that 
Bachmann was 'not as smooth' as she had been before.

Larry Sabato of the Centre for 
Politics at the University of Virginia pointed out that some of Perry's 
views might cause him problems further down the line, notably his stance
on climate change.

After the debate he tweeted: 'Perry has both won & lost debate. Republicans liked what he said & how he said it.

'But Social Security comments are BIG swing voter problem.'

The other candidates in the debate were Texas Representative Ron Paul, former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, former pizza magnate Herman Cain and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum.

Social Security: 'It is monstrous lie, it's a Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 and 30-years-old today you're paying into a programme that's going to be there.

'Anybody that's for the status quo with Social Security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids.

'I don't care what anyone says, we know that, the American people know that and those 25 and 30-year-old people know that.'The death penalty: 'In the state of Texas, if you come into our state and you kill one of our children, you kill a police officer, you're involved in another crime and you kill one of our citizens you will face the ultimate justice, and that is you will be executed.

'Americans understand justice. I think Americans are clearly in the vast majority of cases supportive of capital punishment.

'When you have committed heinous crimes against our citizens, in the state of Texas... you will face the ultimate justice.'Climate change: 'I do agree that the science is not settled on this.

'The idea we would put Americans' economy in jeopardy based on scientific theory that is not settled yet to me is nonsense.

'Just because you have a group of scientists who stood up and said this is the fact... Galileo got outvoted for a spell.

'To put Americans' economic future in jeopardy, asking us to cut back in areas that would have monstrous economic impact on this country is not good economics and I would suggest is not necessarily good science.

'Find out what the science truly is before you start putting the American economy in jeopardy.'George W Bush and Guantanamo Bay: 'He maintained the chase and we took out a very bad man in the form of bin Laden. I tip my hat to him.

'He kept Gitmo open against the will of his base and I'm glad he did that. America's safer for it.'Foreign policy: 'I don't think America needs to be in the business of adventurism.

'Americans don't want to see their young men and women going into foreign countries without a clear reason that American interests are at stake.

'They want to see a clear exit strategy as well.'The economy: 'What Americans are looking for is somebody who can get this country working again.

'We created one million jobs in state of Texas at the same time America lost two and a half million.

'Americans are focused on the right issue and that is who on this stage can get America working?'The deficit: 'We have to cut the snake's head off. Until you get a balanced budget amendment then the American people can go to sleep at night with a little more comfort and know they're not going to be broke in the morning.'
