Suspended: Michaelle Capwell has been suspended from work at the Mothercare store after she smoke an e-cigarette in front of customers

A shop worker thrown out of the store where she worked and suspended after smoking an e-cigarette in front of customers.

Michelle Capwell, 41, claimed she had forgotten the smoke substitute was in her pocket and automatically took it out for a drag when she was spotted by a manager.

But just five minutes after putting it away just was given her marching orders and suspended with immediate effect.

The mother-of-two was working at PixiFoto, a booth inside Mothercare in Festival Park, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, when she was caught smoking the e-cigarette earlier this month.

Ms Capwell, from Abbey Hulton, Staffordshire, said: 'I was talking to my area manager at the time, about a misunderstanding about what time I should have started my shift that day and I was feeling stressed.

'The day before I had bought an e-cigarette and it was in my pocket. I didn’t even think about it - I took it out, had a shot of it and put it back in my pocket.

'Then about five minutes later I got a call from a manager to say I used my e-cigarette on the shop floor and to get my stuff and go.'

Ms Capwell said she had seen customers using the e-cigarettes on the shop floor and had not been told staff were not allowed.

She said: 'There are no signs up and nothing has been sent out to us saying we were not allowed to use them.

'I’m not saying I should have done it, but it was a one-off and only for a couple of seconds. The shop was quiet at the time.

Reaction: The mother-of-two said staff has described the reaction as 'over-the-top'

'The reaction was over the top - there was no warning, I was just told to leave. I was gobsmacked. If I had been given a warning, I wouldn’t have done it again.'

A PixiFoto spokesman said: 'Michelle was told to leave the store. She is still employed by the company and is currently on paid leave while we investigate other issues.'

There are thought to be 1.5 million e-cigarette users in the UK, compared to nine million tobacco smokers.

Battery-operated E-cigarettes look like real cigarettes and turn nicotine into a vapour inhaled by the user.

According to a study in New Zealand published last month, they are as effective as nicotine patches in getting smokers to quit.

And although some countries have banned them, e-cigarettes can at present be bought without restriction in the UK.

In June however it was announced by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) that they were to be regulated as medicines.

Laws vary widely concerning their use and sale, and are the subject of pending legislation and ongoing debate.

In theory they can be used anywhere: planes, hospitals or restaurants, but some companies are banning them on varying grounds.

One French study claims they contain carcinogenic chemicals that make some as harmful as normal tobacco.

They are used by more than 3.5m Americans and 1.5m people in the UK.

As they've grown in popularity there have been several reports of e-cigarettes exploding due to the lithium-ion batteries inside them becoming overheated.
