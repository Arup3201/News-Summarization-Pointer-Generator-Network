Scientists believe studying the bones of the Elephant Man could give clues about the abnormal cell growth that causes cancer

Studying the Elephant Man’s bones could give clues about the causes of cancer, experts believe.

Scientists think his skeleton could shed light on abnormal cell growth and its causes.

This could reveal why cells start to grow out of control causing tumours.

Previously, attempts to study the bones of the Elephant Man, whose real name was Joseph Carey Merrick, failed.

This was because DNA could not be extracted from the bones as they had been cleaned with bleach.

However, new techniques have now allowed testing to resume, the BBC reports.

It is hoped this research will finally clear up the mystery of exactly what caused his disfigurement and that it could also give clues about other diseases, such as cancer.

Professor Richard Trembath, of Queen Mary University of London, where the bones are stored, told the BBC that the underlying genetic problem responsible for tissue overgrowth in the Elephant Man could also reveal clues to how a cell grows, and how it knows when it should stop growing.

He said: 'While I wouldn’t predict that Merrick is sitting on the cure for cancer, it is through studies of this nature that we will have a better understanding of what it is that determines how a cell moves from a normal state, into this abnormal process of disregular cell growth.’

Joseph Carey Merrick was born in 1862 in Leicester.

He began to develop disfiguring tumours before he reached the age of two and his condition deteriorated rapidly.

It left him unable to work meaning he had to enter a workhouse, but he was so desperate to escape the workhouse that he moved to London and participated in an act called 'the Elephant Man, Half-a-Man and Half-an-Elephant'.

When public opinion turned against the idea of freak shows, Mr Merrick moved to live at the London Hospital.

He died unexpectedly in 1890 at the age of 27.

Previous attempts to study DNA from the bones failed because the skeleton was cleaned with bleach. Image shows Joesph Merrick's bones being put through a CT scanner

It is still not known for sure what caused his disfigurement but it is thought that he had Proteus syndrome.

This is a condition which causes the atypical growth of the bones and skin and is more common in men than women.

Its cause is unknown but it can cause gigantism of the limbs, increased organ size, rough skin, tumours and life-threatening blood clots.
