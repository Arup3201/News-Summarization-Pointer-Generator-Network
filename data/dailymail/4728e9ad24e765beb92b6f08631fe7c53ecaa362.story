Germany is spending just £3.5million on events to mark the start of the First World War – compared with the joint £50million Britain and France have pledged.

Berlin insists history is not ‘being neglected’ and that events are planned across the country to mark the 100th anniversary of the war.

However, many Germans are ashamed of their country’s role in the conflict.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has still not committed to attending any of the commemorations at home or abroad.

The German Historical Museum in Berlin is planning an exhibition, while France and Germany are co-operating on a new museum in Alsace-Lorraine, where thousands of soldiers from both nations died.

The German government revealed the figure following a question in parliament from an MP from the far-left party Die Linke, Sevim Dagdelen.

Modern message: Chancellor Merkel wants to use the anniversary to promote European unity

She called for a ‘massive increase’ in funds, adding: ‘It is a scandal that the government is marking the commemoration of the beginning of the First World War with – mostly – inaction.’

German historian Gerd Krumeich, who is advising the French government on the centenary, said the German government is ‘fundamentally uninterested’ in it.

Holfer Afflerbach, a German professor of history at Leeds University, said: ‘Both the UK and France have set aside vast funds for the commemoration and in good time, while Germany decided that their efforts would be reactive – so no wonder many feel that attitude is a bit stupid.’

The war destroyed three European empires, cost 10 million lives, wounded 20 million and paved the way in Germany for the rise of the Nazis and WW2.

Germany wants to be seen using the centenary of the outbreak of war as a means to promote its agenda for today of closer European unity.

The French-German museum at the site of the Hartmannsweilerkopf battlefield in French Alsace, where up to 30,000 Germans and Frenchmen died on what the troops called the 'Mountain of Death.', is one of the main projects.

French President François hollande and the German Federal President, Joachim Gauck, will lay a foundation stone for a new museum chronicling the fighting there at the start of August.

The message is simple; European unity, not emnity.

There are exhibitions planned in Berlin, at the Army Museum in Dresden and several other sites.  Numerous websites are devoted to understanding the war and the fragile peace that followed.  

'Our look is at reconciliation, to have as many former enemies together as possible and to show that we have learned from our mistakes,' said Norman Walter, a spokesman for the German Embassy in London.
