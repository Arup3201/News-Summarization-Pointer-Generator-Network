Killer: Alison Bowen, 61, hit cyclist Paul Novak at 60mph. She pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving

A drunk grandmother who mowed down and killed a cyclist carried on driving for more than five miles - because she thought she hit a badger.

Alison Bowen, 61, had been drinking wine at lunch before she hit Paul Novak, 50, while driving down the A21 in Robertsbridge, Sussex, at 60mph.

She collided with the cyclist with with such force that her windscreen shattered. He was carried 50 feet on the bonnet of her Fiat Punto before he was thrown the car and died at the side of the road.

She kept driving for another five-and-a-half miles, and only stopped when she crashed into a verge, later telling police she thought she had hit a badger.

Bowen has now been jailed for seven years after pleading guilty to causing death by careless driving while over the limit alcohol.

At a sentencing hearing in Lewes Crown Court, Sussex, Judge Shani Barnes said Bowen made 'the worst decision of her life' in driving drunk.

Prosecutor Mary Walford said the grandmother had had three or four glasses of wine with a friend over lunch that afternoon in November.

She was at more than double the drink-drive limit but, but said no when a friend's husband offered to drive her home.

Witnesses said Bowen appeared to accelerate after hitting Mr Novak. The court heard the impact threw him and his bike off her bonnet seconds later.

James Blatcher, a minibus driver who saw the incident, told the court how Bowen was 'driving erratically, drifting towards the middle of the road' after the impact.

Members of the public and police who spoke to Bowen when her car finally stopped said she was slurring her words and smelled of alcohol.

The court heard she was hysterical, telling them 'this is not normal for me'. She had cuts on her knuckles from the shattered windscreen glass.

Mitigating, Laura Plant said her client could not remember driving away from the crash because she had been in shock.

She claimed Bowen was stressed over family matters and was taking anti-depressants at the time.

She offered her client's 'most sincere apologies' to Mr Novak's family, including his mother, Ann Novak, who was at court for the sentencing.

In a statement read to the court, Mrs Novak described clearing her son's flat in Hastings, East Sussex, after his death.

She said: 'It was painfully obvious he had no idea he was not coming home. The kitchen window was open and bacon defrosting on top of the fridge freezer.'

Mr Novak was a keen chess player and artist who loved cycling so much he had never learned to drive.

His mother added: 'I am finding it very difficult to come to terms with the fact that Paul is no longer here.'

After the case Sergeant Dan Pitcher said: 'Paul Novak was the innocent victim of a woman who selfishly decided to drink and then drive home. He had no chance to avoid Bowen or to do anything that could have saved him from her.

'Bowen was so drunk when she struck Mr Novak that she did not even know what she had done. After the collision she must have been able to see next to nothing out of her windscreen and could have easily caused more serious or even fatal accidents.

'This horrific case shows exactly why we cannot and will not tolerate any drink- or drug-driving in Sussex.'

Speaking after the sentencing, the victim's mother Mrs Novak added: 'My only son Paul had his life snuffed out in seconds through no fault of his own.

'No sentence will ever be enough to take away the pain I feel that I will not get the chance to spend the rest of my life with him. I still cannot come to terms with the fact that Paul is no longer with us.

'I have been given great support by my family, friends and the police but nothing can prepare you for the death of your child and nothing takes away the sorrow.

'Paul was more relaxed and happy than he had been for years when he was taken from us. I feel robbed that I won't get to enjoy this phase of his life with him - all because of the selfish actions of Alison Bowen.'
