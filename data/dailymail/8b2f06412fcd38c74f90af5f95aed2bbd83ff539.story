To some it may seem like a trivial reason for a diplomatic spat, but a row has broken out between Austria and Slovenia over a regional sausage.

The dispute erupted after Slovenia began attempts to get the Krainer sausage special protected EU status - similar to Melton Mowbray pork pies, the Cornish pasty, Champagne and Parmesan.

The country claims the beloved specialty, made of minced pork and seasoned with garlic and pepper, was invented in northern Slovenia in the 19th Century.

Dispute: Austria and Slovenia are clashing over and application to get this pork sausage Protected Geographical Indication statud

But Austria insists a cheese-filled variation of the sausage, the Kaesekrainer, belongs to their nation.

The two countries are now at loggerheads over who has the best claim to the pork sausage.

Slovenia is applying to the European Commission for Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status, because of the meat's connection to the Kranjska region.

It would mean only a sausage prepared in that specific region could bear the name Krainer.

But Austria has vowed to challenge the bid.

Row: If the two nations cannot settle their dispute over the sausage, the European Commission with make a ruling on the issue

‘To rename this beloved speciality is simply impossible. Vienna sausage stands are a trademark of the city and Kaesekrainers have to be on offer.

'Frankfurter sausages are called Wiener Wuerstel in Germany and that is not a problem,’ Vienna Chamber of Commerce’s Josef Bitzinger said in a statement to the BBC.

To qualify for the protected 
geographical indication status, EU bureaucrats have to be satisfied a 
specialty product comes from a specific region or country, and has a 
definite quality, goodwill or other characteristic , attributable to its
geographical origin.

The entire product must be 
traditionally and at least partially manufactured within the specific 
region and thus acquire unique properties.

The European Commission will make a ruling if the two countries cannot resolve the issue in the next six months.
