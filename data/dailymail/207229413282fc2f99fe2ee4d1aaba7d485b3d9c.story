Given his age and experience, Peter Crouch was the last man you expected to hit the self-destruct button and cost Stoke City a pulsating cup-tie.

Crouch's arrival from the bench had helped inspire a Stoke fightback after they trailed 2-0 at the interval, even though Southampton manager Ronald Koeman noted ruefully 'it was not the way I like to play football'.

But having done the hard work and with Stoke back on level terms, the 33-year-old former England striker inexplicably lunged first at Jose Fonte and then Steven Davis to pick up two yellow cards in 80 seconds and leave Stoke a man short for the remaining couple of minutes.

That was all Southampton needed. 

Davis floated in a free-kick and without Crouch's 6ft 6ins presence there was panic in the Stoke ranks. The ball bounced off the waist of Erik Pieters and Graziano Pelle smashed the ball into the roof of the net for his second goal of the night and ninth of the season.

'Peter went high with his second challenge so there is always that risk when you are already on a yellow,' acknowledged Stoke manager Mark Hughes.

'It shows the emotion of a cup tie can get to even the most experienced players. Some of the wind went out of our sails. We didn't deal with the next ball into our own box and it fell to the last man we'd want.'

Southampton, riding high in the Premier League, now have a winnable quarter-final at League One Sheffield United and Koeman, who won Euro '88 and the Champions League as a player, is dreaming of leading the club to their first major trophy since winning the FA Cup in 1976.

'We were much the better team on the pitch tonight,' he said. 'It was real cup football and Stoke made it a real battle when they brought Crouch on. It is one of their qualities.

We don't have European football and this is the chance of a title.

'Stoke have had a bad fortnight with issues over grappling, diving and Bojan allegedly throwing his boots in the dressing-room.

Bojan was given only his third start but Stoke started sluggishly and fell behind after six minutes when Pelle was given time and space to curl a 25-yard shot beyond Asmir Begovic. 

Worse was to follow for the home side. Steven Davis appeared close to the Stoke by-line and as he cut the ball back, three Stoke players inexplicably retreated into their own six-yard box while Long fired home unmarked from eight. It was Long's first Saints goal since his £12million move to Hull, whom he faces at the weekend.

Stoke were booed off at half-time with Hughes admitting 'we lacked the intensity needed' but they threw themselves a lifeline three minutes after the restart when Steven Nzonzi took advantage of a retreating Southampton defence to shoot in from 18 yards.

The visitors had chances to wrap the game up with Davies having a shot blocked by Ryan Shawcross and Long volleying over from Dusan Tadic's glorious pass.

But when Hughes reverted to 'old Stoke' with 17 minutes left and sent on the cavalry in the form of Crouch and Charlie Adam – Bojan one of the players to make way – and the comeback looked on.

It wasn't exactly pretty. Adam's first act was to exact retribution on Saints midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin who had hurt Jonathan Walters in the first half. The Scot caught Schneiderlin on the back of the leg with a raking stud and the mild-mannered Koeman jumped up to protest.

'I said to the fourth referee that in my opinion it was a red card. He had no intention to play the ball. It was from behind,' he said.

But Adam escaped with a yellow and supplied the 84th minute corner from which Mame Diouf headed Stoke's equaliser. Ironically, Shawcross had a part to play by gently nudging Florin Gardos out the way.

From 2-2, Stoke should have completed a rousing victory. Instead, Crouch behaved idiotically and Hughes, who won the League Cup as a player with Manchester United, Chelsea and Blackburn Rovers, won't be getting his hands on the trophy this year.
