The teacher who organised vile Thatcher ‘death parties’ and compared the Baroness to 
Hitler, bought her council house using the Iron Lady's right-to-buy scheme and then doubled her money, it was revealed today.

Romany Blythe, 45, made £150,0000 when she sold her North London home four years after buying it off the local authority in Islington.

Lady Thatcher wanted to increase house ownership in the 1980s after she came to power, so she let council property residents snap them up for bargain prices from local authorities.

And it appears that extreme anti-Thatcherite Miss Blythe used the scheme to make a huge sum of cash.

Thatcher hater: Romany Blythe invited 5,000 to a party celebrating the Iron Lady's death, but years earlier bought a council house (right) using the landmark right-to-buy scheme, selling it for double what she paid

Sale: Documents show that Miss Blythe bought the house in Islington for £141,000 and then sold it four years later for £298,000

In June 2006 Miss Blythe, of Worthing, West Sussex, bought the leasehold of a flat in a pretty Victorian townhouse from Islington Council for £141,000.

Just four years later she sold the North London property for £298,000. If she had sold it within three years she would have had to repay some cash to the council.

Speaking next to a burning effigy of the former Prime Minister at a demo last weekend in Trafalgar Sqaure, she said: 'The council houses were sold, what a wonderful thing to be able to own your own home and I have no problem with poorer people being able to buy their own home but that money went straight to central government.

'It wasn't used to build more council houses for people for affordable rents. Teachers have to come in to work from miles away. People can't afford to live in central London.'

Protests: Miss Blythe, who specialises in teaching troubled children, wrote: 'Who wants to p*** on her grave?' as she encouraged people to celebrate Lady Thatcher's death

She added: 'I think Thatcher was a despot. She was cold, calculating and she knew exactly what she was doing.

Surgery: Romany Blythe was given breast implants on the NHS because she complained of low self-esteem, it also emerged

'I don't care about Thatcher, I didn't care about her dying, I don't care about celebrating her death. I care about the issues and I care about being able to mark that.

'I am not interested in celebrating someone's death, I am interested that there is a whitewash of who she was, and that she is not made out to be some wonderful woman.

'History does not forget'

Mss Blythe was unavailable for comment today.

Romany Blythe called Lady Thatcher a despot and said: ‘They danced in the streets when Hitler died, too’.

The 45-year-old – who was given breast implants on the NHS because she complained of low self-esteem – had sparked outrage by creating an internet page called: ‘The witch is dead.’

On it she urged more than 5,000 people to attend a death party in central London on Monday.

Miss Blythe, who specialises in teaching troubled children, wrote of Lady Thatcher: ‘Who wants to p*** on her grave?’

She later attempted to defend her behaviour by claiming she was ‘the voice of reason’.

‘I didn’t do the rioting – I just organised a Facebook page. I’m actually the voice of reason. I didn’t fan the flames. It was a way for us to come together and create unity and solidarity.
