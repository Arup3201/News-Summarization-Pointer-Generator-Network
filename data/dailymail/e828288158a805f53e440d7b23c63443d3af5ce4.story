Pre-op: Paris Green, who was born Peter Laing, has been 
moved from Scotland's only women's prison after he allegedly had sex 
with fellow inmates

A pre-op transsexual locked up in a women's jail for a savage torture-killing has been moved to a different prison after claims he was having sex with female inmates.

Murderer Paris Green, 22, who was previously known as Peter Laing, was allowed to serve his 18-year sentence in Cornton Vale women’s prison, in Stirling, because he says he is transgendered.

But today it emerged he has been moved amid suspicions that he was involved in casual-sex relationships with other convicts there.

Green was sent to the prison only five
 weeks ago after he was found guilty, alongside Kevin McDonagh, 23, and 
Dean Smith, 20, of the murder of Robert Shankland in March this year.

The
 trio had invited Mr Shankland, 45, to a party in Green's flat in the 
central Scotland town of Glenrothes. There he was tied up, beaten and 
tortured for hours before finally being murdered.

Despite
 a campaign by Mr Shankland's parents, Mary and Ian Bell, Green was told
 he could serve his sentence in a women's prison prior to 
taxpayer-funded gender realignment surgery.

Now
 after his dalliances with fellow convicts at Cornton Vale, he is to be 
kept in the women's section of Edinburgh's Saughton jail.

Mrs
 Bell, 69, said yesterday: 'It doesn't make any difference where he is 
to me. He's in the women's bit of the jail and he's still a man.

'There's no point in campaigning because it's not going to get us anywhere. There's not much we can do now.'

Mrs Bell added she was not prejudiced against transgender individuals.

Mr Shankland's Stepfather 79-year-old Mr Bell, said: 'The law's a farce. It doesn't give society any protection.'

18-year sentence in Cornton Vale women's prison, in Stirling, because he

Sources at Cornton Row told the Daily 
Record that prison warders had warned Green and his partners there that 
their behaviour was not acceptable.

One
 Scottish Prisons Service source said: 'It was claimed that there were 
­inappropriate incidents with women in ­Cornton Vale. This was put to 
the prisoner and then there was a transfer agreed.'

A second source told the Record: 'He was warned several times about his behaviour.'

or blunt force injuries

The behaviour of the three murderers who subjected Mr Shankland to hours of torture in Green's flat was described by a judge as 'utterly depraved'.

During the attack, Mr Shankland was tied up with bedding, battered, kicked and attacked with a rolling pin. He died as a result of either suffocation or blunt force injuries.

Green's friend Maggie Shields told the trial at the High Court in Glasgow that she visited the flat and learned about the death - before recalling how the trio boasted about the beating.

Miss Shields went on to say the violence had erupted after a row about buying a bag of chips.

As he lay dying, the killers ate ham sandwiches paid for with the proceeds of selling their victim's mobile phone.
