Killer Adrian Prout has begged his partner to stand by him after his shock murder confession as police teams prepare to dig up his wife's body tomorrow.

The millionaire, 47, made a tearful phone call to devastated fiancée Debbie Garlick, 41, after he finally owned up to killing wife Kate, 55, and dumping her in a woodland grave.

Shackled and sombre, Prout lead detectives on Friday to the spot where he buried the corpse of the former school teacher - more than a year after he was jailed for her murder and four years after she went missing.

Prout (pictured right getting out of the van) arrived at the farm in handcuffs late this morning. He is expected to direct officers to the precise spot where he buried his wife's body

Police today focused on an area of woodland where Prout guided them during a 25 minute visit to the 276-acre farm

The former businessman was driven 
from prison to the £1.3 million country estate in Gloucestershire he 
shared with Kate.

He
had always denied harming his wife, claiming that she stormed out  on 
Bonfire Night in 2007 to ‘wind him up’ following a series of rows.

But although her body was never found, a jury convicted him of murder last year.

Now he is trying to win back new girlfriend Debbie, who had relentlessly campaigned for his release from prison, insisting he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.

Yesterday she revealed he had phoned her from prison and pleaded with her to stand by him - but claimed she felt 'betrayed'.

Debbie, who has 21-month-old child 
Evie with Prout, said: 'Adrian is in a terrible state and I don't want 
anything bad happening to him.

'I'm not worried about myself. I feel
badly betrayed but my main concern is for Kate's family. Their peace of
mind is more important.'

Debbie lived at  the couple's former Redhill Farm home, in Redmarley, until two weeks ago. She had campaigned for his 
release and even offered £10,000 of her own money as a reward for 
information which would prove his innocence.

On Friday Prout was taken in a 
Mercedes Viano people carrier from Garth prison, near Blackpool, to his 
former home at Redhill Farm, Redmarley, Gloucestershire.

At the gates of the 276-acre estate 
he was transferred to a marked police car and driven down a track 
towards woodland to identify the spot where he is believed to have 
hidden his wife’s body.

It is hoped that Mrs Prout's body will be found soon so that her grieving family can finally lay her to rest

Dozens of police vehicles were today dotted around the farm including diggers and 4x4s. He is thought to have strangled his wife and then used his expertise as a professional pipe-layer to bury her body on the farmland

Prout admitted the murder three 
months after failing a lie detector test which his family and Miss 
Garlick had begged him to take in the hope that it would exonerate him.

Don Cargill, chairman of the British 
and European Polygraphy Association, who conducted the test, said 
Prout’s heart rate, blood pressure, sweat and breathing patterns were 
monitored as he was asked if he killed his wife.

Mr Cargill said after failing, Prout gave a wry smile and admitted that the findings  were correct.

‘I told him that according to my 
tests, he was clearly a murderer. But he only smiled again in what was 
one of the most surreal and chilling experiences of my life.’

Police will begin digging in woodland 
next to the couple's former home. Detectives revealed they had drafted in specialist equipment and extra manpower to start the operation to retrieve Kate's body.

Inspector Les Pritchard, from 
Gloucestershire Police, explained the two-day delay between Prout 
identifying her gruesome grave and the body's recovery.

He said: 'We have to do things properly and this means it will take a little time.'

Yesterday campaigners fighting to free killer Adrian Prout from prison shut down their website after his confession.

Justice For Adrian Prout, which featured news articles and information on how to lobby for his release, was pulled after Prout admitting murdering his wife.

A message posted on the online blog, hosted by the Wrongly Accused Person Organisation, said it was ceasing all activities and expressed sympathy with Kate's family.

During Prout’s trial at Bristol Crown
Court, the jury heard about the couple’s disintegrating marriage. By 
2006, Mrs Prout would often stay  with friends after arguing with her 
husband.

The following year she demanded an £800,000 divorce settlement, £200,000 more  than her husband wanted to give her.

When she disappeared soon afterwards, he insisted that she had probably left for good.

Prout, who organised commercial shoots and ran a pipe-laying firm, was convicted of murder by a 10-1 majority in February 2010.
