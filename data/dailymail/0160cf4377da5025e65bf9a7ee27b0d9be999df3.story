What more can Alexis Sanchez do to force his way back into the middle?

Out on the left wing against Queens Park Rangers, where he has moved to make way for Mesut Ozil since his return from injury, he cut a frustrated figure for much of the game.

But when he started making runs through the middle, testing Queens Park Rangers defenders and putting them on the back foot with his pace, the chances came. After 70 minutes, that was rewarded with a wonderful individual goal.

The talk ahead of kick-off was that Sanchez simply does not perform as well when Ozil is on the pitch. In the first 45 minutes, they exchanged the ball a total of three times.

That’s not to say that every player on the pitch must combine at all times, but Arsenal fans are within their rights to expect £72.5million worth of talent, playing next to each other in an attacking midfield trio, to develop some kind of wavelength.

In the first half Sanchez, Arsenal’s best player this season by far, could not get into the game on the flank, making way for Ozil as No 10 since his comeback from injury.

In October, there were stories in Chile, from newspaper La Tercera, that Sanchez and Ozil had fallen out. Sanchez felt the German was not giving him enough opportunities on the pitch, it was reported.

From this performance, he would have a point. It took 22 minutes before they found one another, Sanchez passing into his team-mate.

At one stage, the Chilean was screaming for the ball wide and free on the left, but Ozil went to play the switch and instead feinted.

But perhaps it is not even about the pair of them being on the pitch together so much as Sanchez being wasted on the left.

By the 62nd minute, he was clearly frustrated out wide when he made a run down the wing and Olivier Giroud failed to send the ball into his path. He let his team-mate know.

In one red-hot period after he scored his first goal for the club against Besiktas he netted 12 in 14 games, from August to the start of November. Now it is just one in eight games, coinciding with Ozil’s return.

When he ventured into the middle in the 47th minute, carried the ball into the box with a step-over before aiming one for the far right bottom corner, it was hard to see why he is not guaranteed a central spot all the time. He repeated the act in the 58th minute, growing in confidence with every shot on goal. These two acts alone far exceeded anything Ozil produced.

Then as if to reaffirm his ability to score, he evaded the presence of young QPR full-back Daniel Furlong inside the box on the left, before firing a shot into Rob Green’s near post for Arsenal’s second.

It is all well and good Sanchez displaying an enviable work-rate down the wing, one that surely impresses Arsene Wenger, but it’s more well and good if he is through the middle stretching defences to breaking point.

Against QPR, this was not vintage Arsenal and they made hard work of a team fighting relegation, a team they should be sweeping aside.

It cannot be denied that they are finding results, getting wins, but in the biggest match of their season, against Monaco, they were found lacking.

As this game drew on, Sanchez displayed a lovely deftness of touch to control the ball with his knee then flick it over an opponent in one fluid motion. Where was he? In the middle of the attacking third. Where he belongs.
