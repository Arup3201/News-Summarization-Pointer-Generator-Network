Quit: Paul Tucker announced he is stepping down as Bank of England Deputy Governor

Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker is to step down after missing out on the top job.

He had been tipped to become the governor when Sir Mervyn King retired, but became caught up in the scandal of banks fixing lending rates.

Today it was announced Mr Tucker will leave the bank after spending a few months supporting new governor, Canadian Mark Carney.

/Mr Tucker said he planned to spend time in academia in the United States following his departure.

He has faced speculation over his role at the Bank after he lost out to Mr Carney in the race to take over from Sir Mervyn.

He was a key figure involved
in banking reform and overhauling UK 
financial regulation.

But he was badly damaged by the interbank rate-rigging scandal when former Barclays boss Bob 
Diamond claimed Mr Tucker had told the bank to lower its Libor 
submissions.

Mr Tucker denied leaning on Barclays, but the episode is widely thought to have cost him the top job at the Bank.

Announcing his decision to quit, Mr Tucker said: ‘It has been an extraordinary honour to serve at the Bank of England over the past 30 years.

‘I am very proud that, through the Bank and the wider central banking community, I have been able to make a contribution to monetary and financial stability. I will continue to do so in the coming months.’

In an exchange of letters over his decision to leave, Chancellor George Osborne praised Mr Tucker for the ‘tremendous contribution’ he has made to UK monetary and financial policy.

He added Mr Tucker had helped shape changes being made to the financial system across the world in the wake of the banking crisis.

He wrote: ‘Your intellectual capacity and independence have proved invaluable in building solutions to the greatest financial challenges we have faced in generations.’

Mr Tucker was appointed deputy governor for financial stability in 2009 and he is a member of the recently created watchdog, the Financial Policy Committee, as well as on the board of the Prudential Regulation Authority.

Sir Mervyn King is standing down as Bank Governor next month, but deputy Mr Tucker was over-looked

Mr Tucker's departure will see him stand down early from his five year term, which is due to end in February 2014, although his exact leaving date is yet to be announced.

His decision to step down will leave Mr Carney with the task of hiring two new deputy governors, as Charlie Bean is also due to leave at the end of June next year.

Mr Bean, who is deputy governor for monetary policy, had been due to stand down on the same day as Sir Mervyn, but agreed to remain in post for another year to help Mr Carney.

Andrew Bailey - chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority - is the Bank's third deputy governor in charge of prudential policy.

Sir Mervyn paid tribute to Mr Tucker's time at the Bank.

He said: ‘Paul's contribution to the Bank, to monetary policy, and more generally to public policy, both in the UK and in the world as a whole has been enormous.’

Mr Carney, who has worked with Mr Tucker on the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), said: ‘Paul has contributed immeasurably to a series of critical financial reforms, including policies to end Too-Big-to-Fail and to build more resilient derivative and funding markets.’

Mr Tucker, 55, joined the Bank in 1980 soon after graduating from Cambridge University.

The Treasury said the process to appoint Mr Tucker's successor had not yet started, but would be set out ‘in due course’.

All governor and deputy governor appointments at the Bank are formally made by the Queen, on recommendation of the Prime Minister and Mr Osborne, although Mr Carney is expected to be closely involved in the process.
