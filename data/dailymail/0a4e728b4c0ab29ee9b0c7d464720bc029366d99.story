Eighteen months ago, at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium, English cricket enjoyed one of the most pleasurably unexpected Test wins in its history.

Much has been made of the contribution to that victory of Kevin Pietersen, and understandably so: here was proof of what, by then, was becoming a cliche – that he was a player of great innings, if not necessarily a great player.

But the unexpectedness resided mainly in the fact that England had outspun India – and that they did so after India’s captain MS Dhoni had called, with a tone of voice that sounded dangerously close to enthusiasm, for a turning track.

On the outside looking in: England have problems in the spin department now Graeme Swann has retired

Graeme Swann had match figures of eight for 113, and Monty Panesar 11 for 210. Between them, and despite India’s batsmen having first use of the pitch, Ravichandran Ashwin, Pragyan Ojha and an over-the-hill Harbhajan Singh managed nine for 400. The world had gone mad.

Those unearthly few days came to mind this week as we surveyed the domestic scene a month into the first season after the retirement of Swann. And the fact was this: as play resumed on Monday morning in the sixth round of County Championship matches, not a single spinner sat in the top 10 of the Division One bowling averages.

Highest in the list was Warwickshire’s New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel, whose 14 wickets at 25 placed him 12th. Next came Simon Kerrigan, the Lancashire slow left-armer who has yet to shake off the stigma of his Ashes meltdown at The Oval. He was 23rd, with 10 wickets at 27.

The situation was slightly rosier in Division Two, where Glamorgan’s left-armer Dean Cosker (18 at 17) was third in the averages, and Kent’s offie Adam Riley (14 at 19) was 10th. And if the 22-year-old Riley fits neatly into the ‘one to watch’ category, Cosker is 36. With the best will in Wales, he will never play for England.

April and May have never been auspicious months for English spinners. June isn’t great either. July is reasonable, because pitches have started to dry out, but August is when the slow bowlers start to cash in. This August, there will be one full round of Championship matches.

The dice have always been loaded against English spinners – or at least they have been since the advent of covered pitches. Yet, as England seek to embark on the post-Swann era, it is troubling that this should still be the case.

Swann’s five-year Test career allowed English cricket to pretend there was not a problem, while the bowler himself allowed the Test team to play a four-man attack. And because he gave the ball such a rip, he could take the moral high ground when it came to questioning the legitimacy of deliveries he didn’t need, such as the doosra.

But he might just as easily have been called Black instead of Graeme: this particular Swann’s progress has been the exception, not the rule.

It was no coincidence that Swann learned his trade on the turning tracks of Northampton, before honing it on less helpful surfaces at Trent Bridge. One taught him how to attack, the other how to defend: unusually among English spinners, he spent his Test career doing both.

Yet counties no longer produce turners, for fear of producing pitches marked ‘poor’ and ripe for the penalising. And so we had the curious situation last summer in which dryness was to be found at Test venues only, the better to help Swann beat Australia. And he obliged, with 26 wickets at 29 each.

In 2015, England won’t be able to try the same trick, because a combination of dodgy weather, questionable scheduling, seaming surfaces that increase a county’s chance of a result, and our traditional suspicion of anyone who bowls more slowly than 75mph (or more quickly than 90) will have regressed our cricket to its mean – to a world in which the spinner is tolerated rather than nurtured.

There is talk this summer of producing bouncier tracks to defeat Sri Lanka and India, and it may well work. Panesar may fill in for a few games, before the debate reopens about his batting and fielding.

But none of it will change the fact that, with Swann now out of the way, English cricket’s chickens are coming home to roost.

Clear your diaries!

Pity the cricketers of India. With the IPL final taking place on June 1, and their flight to England leaving on June 22, the three-week hiatus looked like the perfect time to count earnings and recharge batteries. Except that the BCCI have decided to use the downtime to play a – what else! – three-match one-day series in Bangladesh.

One of the consequences of leading the putsch at the ICC earlier this year was that India had to throw sweeteners this way and that to get the vote through. Three games in five days in Dhaka in mid-June, so keeping the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s TV partners in clover, was one of the conditions. And India are taking the trip so seriously that both MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli will sit it out. The administrators must be proud.

On their knees: The India team could be very tired by the time they land in England in late June

In Delhi 10 days ago, umpire Sanjay Hazare refused to refer a run-out appeal against Kevin Pietersen to his TV colleague. Replays showed Pietersen was out by a foot, and Rajasthan captain Shane Watson’s repeated requests for a replay proved in vain. Hazare later put this strangeness down to ‘a human error’.

Now, he has been removed from the IPL’s umpiring panel. According to the IPL chairman Ranjib Biswal, ‘there are many reasons’. Whatever can he mean?

So,
 the Big Three are going to take charge of cricket’s anti-corruption 
drive? Will that be the same Big Three that is headed up by N 
Srinivasan, who has been instructed by India’s Supreme Court to step 
down as BCCI President while investigations continue into the IPL 
spot-fixing scandal that occurred under his watch? Yes, it would.

As
 England subsided to 88 all out against the Netherlands in Chittagong 
last month, it was widely agreed that they had missed a calm head, a 
wise old bird who would have taken one look at a target of 134 on a slow
 pitch and decided to milk his way to victory.

Sitting
 on the sidelines throughout the World Twenty20, of course, was Ian 
Bell, who reminded everyone of his class on Friday by making 50 off 34 
balls on a dog of a pitch in Aberdeen against Scotland. The start of a 
new era can also mean Bell reclaiming responsibility at the top of the 
Twenty20 order.

Sweeping statement: Ian Bell's innings against Scotland reminded England of his limited-overs prowess

We may have given the impression two weeks ago that Yuvraj Singh – one-time slayer of Stuart Broad – was a busted flush, incapable of getting the ball off the square and emblematic of a Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise that was too busy admiring all its big-hitters to actually get out there and win games of cricket. We now realise we owe Yuvraj an apology.

In Sunday’s game against Rajasthan Royals, Yuvraj rolled back the clock to thrash 83 off 38 balls, then took four wickets with his left-arm pies. All was right with the world – until Steve Smith and James Faulkner added 85 in 5.2 overs to nick it for the Royals. Still, one step at a time…
