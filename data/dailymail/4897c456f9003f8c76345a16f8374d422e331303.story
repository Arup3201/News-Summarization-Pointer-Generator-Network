Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston is poised to go on holiday at the end of this week after sealing another three signings.

The Seasiders have been struggling to recruit players to fulfil their opening fixture but on Wednesday they completed a deal for Ishmael Miller and John Lundstram has joined on loan from Everton.

Midfielder Lundstram, 20, has joined on a season-long loan while Miller, 27, has signed a one-year deal.
