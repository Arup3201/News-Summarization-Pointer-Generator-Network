Quizzed: Senior Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard has been interviewed by police under caution over allegations he sexually harassed women party activists

Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard was questioned by police yesterday over a ‘torrent’ of claims that he harassed and indecently assaulted women.

The party’s chief executive was questioned under caution for several hours over allegations he molested young activists.

The claims surfaced in February when it emerged that a number of woman activists and party workers had complained of unwanted advances by Lord Rennard, who presided over ‘training’ weekends attended by hundreds of female party hopefuls.

Some claimed he tried to entice them to his bedroom. One threatened to blow the whistle at a tribunal before she was paid off.

Others said they were left ‘shamed and humiliated’.

His solicitors said in a statement: 'We can confirm that Lord Rennard agreed to meet with the police and that he welcomed his first opportunity to refute the basis of allegations made against him.'

The allegations, which surfaced on 
Channel 4 in February, came from Miss Smith, Bridget Harris, a former 
special adviser to Nick Clegg, and two unnamed women.

Mr Clegg said the report made 
‘sobering reading’ and said there was ‘no excuse’ for what had happened 
over 20 years in the party’s corridors of power.

Others say they were left ‘shamed and humiliated’ during his alleged campaign of sexual harassment.

One alleged he put his hands where 
they had ‘no business being’ and another branded him ‘repugnant’ for 
allegedly forcing his hand up her dress as they posed for a photo.

Lord Rennard has said he was ‘deeply shocked’ by the allegations and described them as  a ‘total distortion’ of his character.

But last week Nick Clegg admitted he failed to respond vigorously enough to a series of sexual 
harassment complaints about his party’s former chief executive.

The
Deputy Prime Minister ‘made mistakes’ over the allegations against Lord
Rennard, according to a highly critical report into attitudes to women 
among senior Liberal Democrats.

Mr
Clegg conceded that ‘women had been let down’ after the independent 
report said he should have ‘asked more questions’ when the claims – 
which Lord Rennard denies – arose five years ago.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg admitted his party had failed women for 20 years

There were several missed chances to hold an investigation, the report added.

The inquiry into the wider culture of
the Liberal Democrats spanning two decades was launched after the 
Rennard claims surfaced earlier this year.

Aside from the complaints by four 
women against the peer, witnesses reported 32 other sexual harassment 
and discrimination incidents – including one where a male 
parliamentarian had made inappropriate advances to a very young male 
worker.

City fund manager 
Helena Morrissey – who wrote the report – admitted she was 
‘shocked’ at the party’s failure to live up to its ideals of equality 
and liberty, adding: ‘You have got to practise what you preach’.

Mrs 
Morrissey, who found evidence of ‘low level sexism’, said: ‘Mistakes 
were definitely made.

They 
were made by Nick Clegg, Danny Alexander and Jo Swinson. 'You can make a
mistake and learn  from them, it’s different from setting out to 
mislead or to do something wrong.’ But she added: ‘I am not exonerating 
Nick Clegg.’

A formal 
inquiry should have immediately been launched by Mr Clegg into the 
allegations of improper conduct involving Lord Rennard when they were 
raised by women in 2008, she said.

Mr
Clegg said the report made ‘sobering reading’ and said there was ‘no 
excuse’ for what had happened over 20 years in the party’s corridors of 
power.

He added that it illustrated that 
‘stretching over a 20-year period a series of mistakes were made which 
left a number of women feeling seriously let down and for that there is 
absolutely no excuse whatsoever’.

Mrs Morrissey also singled out Liberal Democrat ministers Jo Swinson and
Danny Alexander for adopting an ‘informal’ approach to the complaints 
which was ‘ultimately not sufficient’.

The inquiry was triggered by the allegations surrounding Lord Rennard 
but it was widened to include how the party dealt with other complaints 
of sexism and harassment.

It spanned complaints from up to 20 years ago. Mrs Morrissey said it 
would not be fair however to hold the party to the same standards for 
events of decades ago that are expected today.

Her report said former leader Charles Kennedy’s ‘relatively relaxed 
management style’, compared to his predecessor Lord Ashdown’s, 
‘contributed to Chris Rennard’s power base’.

Paul Burstow, the party’s chief whip at the time, was also told of the claims about Lord Rennard in 2008.

Businesswoman Helena Morrissey said Mr Clegg should have ordered a formal inquiry into allegations of sexual harassment against Lord Rennard

But the allegations did not surface publicly until this year, when Channel 4 interviewed two alleged victims.

At the time, the party denied that Mr Clegg had any knowledge of specific allegations about Lord Rennard.

He was also quick to criticise the ‘self appointed detectives’ of the 
media as newspapers also investigated the potential scandal.

Mrs Morrissey said there had been ‘no malicious attempt’ to cover up the
claims but that the way they dealt with them had been ‘haphazard’. The 
Deputy Prime Minister had not launched a formal inquiry because he 
believed the alleged victims had not requested one and wanted to keep 
their anonymity, she said.

Mr Clegg told the inquiry: ‘The natural course of action had been to 
challenge Chris [Lord Rennard] in respect of the allegations and this 
was duly done.

He then denied any wrongdoing and the affair was dropped 
since none of the complainants wished to …substantiate their 
allegation.’

Mrs Morrissey admitted she was ‘shocked’ by some of the complaints, such
as one Lib Dem councillor aggressively cornering a female staff member.

Mrs Morrissey criticised the ‘tendency for the party to try to “handle” 
complaints rather than to fully and properly investigate them in a 
timely, professional manner.’

Scotland Yard is investigating allegations against the peer – who has denied any wrongdoing. Lord Rennard declined to comment.

Mr Clegg said he would implement all the recommendations made in Miss 
Morrissey’s report ‘without delay’ and had asked her to check on 
progress in 12 months.

He admitted the party had to do more, adding: ‘We must be a party where 
even a hint of sexism is taken seriously; where every allegation of 
harassment is dealt with properly; and where there can be no fear that 
power or position can be abused.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
