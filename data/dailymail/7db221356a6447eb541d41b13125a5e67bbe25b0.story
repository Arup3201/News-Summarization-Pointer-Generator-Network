A New York police officer allegedly stopped and frisked a black man without a proper reason before arresting him - just because of his race.

Michael Daragjati, 32, searched the man in April on Staten Island without proper cause before arresting him, a Brooklyn criminal complaint said.

Daragjati, who is white, allegedly arrested the man when he complained - and filed a false report saying he had resisted arrest.

Federal authorities say they later intercepted a phone call between Daragjati and a friend, when he said: ‘Another n****r fried, no big deal’.

Daragjati is charged with violating the man’s civil rights - and with extortion as well as wire fraud in incidents relating to an off-duty snowplow business.

If convicted of all charges he could be jailed for up to 60 years and face a fine of up to $850,000, reported the New York Post.

The man complained about his treatment by the officer and was at first allowed to walk away, reported the New York Daily News.

But the man allegedly shouted insults at Daragjati, which prompted him to cross the street and handcuff him.

'The power to arrest (must) be used fairly, responsibly and without bias. Motivated by racial aniumus, the defendant allegedly abused this power and responsibility'

‘The power to arrest (must) be used fairly, responsibly and without bias,’ Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said.

‘Motivated by racial aniumus, the defendant allegedly abused this power and responsibility.’

Daragjati has served with the NYPD for eight years.

The man was kept in jail for around 36 hours before being released.
