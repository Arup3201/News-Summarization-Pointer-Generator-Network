The first ever ‘dance fusion’ week on Strictly has turned everything topsy-turvy. Kimberley Walsh, who’s been stuck in a dancing rut for ages and nearly got booted off, not only topped the leaderboard but scored the only 40 of the series so far.

Then Denise Van Outen, who has been the stand-out dancer and the one to beat, ended up in the dance-off. Blimey, what drama! After all that excitement I think I need to lie down in a darkened room and be fanned by a (shirtless) Artem.

Earning the perfect score for a routine is Strictly’s ultimate accolade and one that only a handful of the celebrity dancers ever manage to achieve. But on Saturday night Kimberley Walsh – or ‘Nimble Kimble’ as she’s been nicknamed on the show – joined their ranks following her half cha-cha-cha, half tango routine.

It was enough to earn a standing  ovation from Len Goodman and cries of ‘the dance of the series’ from a highly excitable Bruno.

And it’s not just fancy footwork that our Kimberley had down pat – whether she’s fired up for the tango or letting it all hang out in the salsa, the girl pouts better than a toddler on the naughty step.

Dance fusion, stolen from Dancing With The Stars – the American version of Strictly – is a new, and somewhat baffling, concept that seemed to have left audience, presenters and dancers alike in a state of complete confusion.

Competing couples had to blend two different dances into one routine using just one piece of music.

Why do this instead of just performing two separate dances is anybody’s guess, but as it appears to have, thankfully, replaced the god-awful swing-a-thon then I’m not complaining. Denise, the contestant who consistently puts in the most hours of training, kicked things off with her jive and quickstep routine which Craig Revel Horwood dismissed as ‘a bit boring’.

Her score of 35 left her in fourth place (out of six) on the leader board and in last night’s dance-off with Nicky Byrne. Thanks to the judges, Denise was saved and  Nicky left the show, but if it had been solely down to the public  vote then I’m not sure she would have survived.

The question of whether Denise’s experience in musical theatre gives her an unfair advantage has never gone away and there’s a strong feeling on many of the Strictly online forums that she shouldn’t be in the final in a fortnight’s time.

Conspiracy theorists were given plenty of food for thought last week, when it was mysteriously announced that producers were changing the rules this year to have four, instead of the usual three, couples in the final.

Is it all a ploy to get Denise to the final? Or maybe Lisa, who, good as she is, is not quite up to the standard of the others?

Who knows. But, surely, more people dancing on a dance show can only be a good thing?

While Denise suffered a setback, dinky Dani Harmer gets better every week and finished second to Kimberley with her quickstep and Charleston mix. It helped that she at least got two dances that vaguely went together, unlike poor Nicky, who had to cobble together a samba and an American smooth.

Following his brilliant performance in the Charleston in the previous show, Louis Smith kept up the high standard with his tango and rumba fusion. Louis revealed that winning the Strictly trophy would mean a great deal to him, since he has won only silver and bronze medals as an Olympian.

Ahh. Bless. I’m guessing he hasn’t seen the trophy, otherwise he’d know it’s just a disco glitterball glued to an old shoe box.
