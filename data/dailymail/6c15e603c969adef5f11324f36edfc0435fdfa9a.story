She was once a trusted member of ‘Team Cupcake’.

In fact, Lisa Grillo was so close to Nigella Lawson that the television chef even invited her Italian assistant to appear on her 2007 BBC cookery series, Nigella Express.

During one episode, the pair were shown embracing on screen before sharing a glass of wine together, while Miss Grillo tasted ice cream made by Miss Lawson.

Miss Grillo first began working as an au pair and nanny for Miss Lawson’s children around 16 years ago and her sister Francesca was recruited as a housekeeper by Charles Saatchi in 2001.

During the trial, the television cook told how her team of assistants was nicknamed ‘Team Cupcake’, a titled dreamed up in 2010. She even explained how she regarded the Grillo sisters as ‘family’ and how the group had a feeling of sisterhood.

She said she had ‘loved’ Lisa, and had regularly confided in her.

She was happy to treat her to thousands of pounds worth of dental treatment and personal gifts, and allow her access to her family doctor.

Miss Lawson had become emotional when telling the trial how Lisa had been ‘a stalwart and helped me through a very difficult time when my first husband was ill and died’. ‘She was a rock,’ she said. ‘I would have done anything for her.’

Anger: But Nigella Lawson stood by Lisa Grillo, left, at least to an extent. She told the trial: 'In my heart of hearts I do not believe Lisa to be a bad person. I believe her not to have a very strong moral compass. I loved Lisa'

She explained that Lisa had left the job at one point and how she had continued to pay her for three months so she would not get ‘too anguished’ about finding a new job.

Speaking in court about the fraud charges Lisa was facing, and of which she would end up being acquitted yesterday, Miss Lawson said: ‘It’s very difficult when you find out that someone you have loved and trusted could behave that way.

‘In my heart of hearts I do not believe Lisa to be a bad person. I believe her not to have a very strong moral compass. I loved Lisa. My children loved Lisa.’
