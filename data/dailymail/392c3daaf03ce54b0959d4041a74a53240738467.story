The Royal Mail has issued a special sheet of first class stamps to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s accession to the throne.

The Diamond Jubilee Miniature Sheet, issued today, is the first time that the official portraits of the Queen, which have been used on stamps, coins and banknotes throughout her reign, have been brought together for a set of stamps.

The new collection includes a new first class diamond blue stamp, which will replace the standard gold stamp in post offices over this year.

The silver coin stamp uses a portrait of the Queen taken in 1953 and is one of two 'coin' stamps in the new Diamond Jubilee collection

This stamp uses a portrait of the Queen taken in 1952 by society photographer Dorothy Wilding. It was used on the first stamp of her reign

One stamp depicts a portrait taken from a £1 banknote first issued to the public in 1960

Another stamp in the new collection depicts Her Majesty as she appeared on a £5 note issued in 1971

This stamp has reproduced the Queen as she appeared on coins used from 1968 onwards

This new first class diamond blue will replace the standard gold stamp in post offices over this year

Since it first appeared, the standard image has been reproduced on more than 220 billion stamps and has now been updated with the words Diamond Jubilee highlighted in iridescent ink on the background.

Included in the set is a first class stamp featuring an image of the Queen reproduced from the very first stamp issued during her reign. The image, from 1952, was taken by society photographer Dorothy Wilding.

The set also includes portraits taken from a £1 banknote first issued in 1960, a £5 note issued in 1971, and two stamps which feature the Queen on two coins - the first a portrait used on coins from 1953 and the second used on coins from 1968.

Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene said: 'Royal Mail is proud of our enduring association with Her Majesty The Queen. It is the company’s honour to play a part in what will be an historic celebration of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

On display: The collection of new stamps was shown at the Bank of England Museum in central London. They are due to be issued from today

Iconic: The Queen's face throughout her reign has been reproduced on more than 220 billion stamps

'The Queen’s image is one of the most recognisable in the world and we are delighted to bring these iconic images together to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s accession.'

This Diamond Jubilee Miniature Sheet is the second of three stamp issues in 2012 celebrating the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

The first was The House of Windsor and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha issued last week, which featured a 1954 portrait of the Queen.

A special eight-stamp issue featuring the Queen throughout the six decades of her reign will be issued on May 31.
