Cindy Anthony claims a change in medication has sharpened her memory

Casey Anthony’s own mother attempted to blow up prosecution evidence against her daughter today as she claimed that she was the one who looked up facts about chloroform on the family’s home computer.

In a stunning twist to the state’s accusation that Casey researched the dangerous compound three months before using it to overpower her two-year-old daughter Caylee, Mrs Anthony revealed that she had herself pulled up Internet pages about chloroform in March 2008, seeking health information relating to her pets.

In testimony that prosecutors later challenged aggressively, Mrs Anthony said that her web searches – previously aired in court as part of the state’s evidence that Casey planned her daughter’s June 2008 murder – resulted from her initially looking up chlorophyll, the substance that gives plants their colour. 

Cindy Anthony testified at daughter Casey's trial that she searched on the home computer for information about physical injuries and chloroform

'I was concerned about my smallest 
Yorkie – we have two Yorkie puppies. The smallest one was having some 
issues where she was extremely tired all the time. Both of the dogs 
would eat the bamboo leaves out the back so I started looking up sources
from the back yard that could cause her to be more sleepy, and I 
started with ‘chlorophyll’ and that prompted me to look up ‘chloroform’'
Mrs Anthony testified in court.

'Looking at chlorophyll, there’s some
bacteria associated with chloroform. It comes from different species of
plants that have red and brown colour, and that prompted me to look up 
chloroform because some species naturally produce chloroform.'

Mrs Anthony also told the court in 
Orlando, Florida, that she had typed in search terms such as ‘hydrogen 
peroxide’ and ‘alcohol’ while seeking to find out more about a health 
scare over hand sanitizers and their possible dangers to children that 
had been brought to her attention by a colleague in March 2008.

She had also inputted other search 
terms relating to bodily injuries because 'a good friend of mine was in a
car accident and had multiple chest and head injuries,' she said.

In another revelation, Mrs Anthony 
said that a stain found in the boot of Casey’s white Pontiac Sunfire car
– which the state has attempted to attribute to Caylee’s dead body 
having been stored in the vehicle before being dumped in a swamp – may 
have been present when she first bought the vehicle.

Mrs Anthony’s sudden claims rattled 
prosecutors who have for 26 days held the upper hand in the trial as 
Casey’s defence team has faltered and made several damaging legal 
blunders.

State attorney Diane Drane-Burdick 
appeared visibly angry and cynical as she tore into Mrs Anthony’s 
evidence, clawing back some ground. She pointed out that Mrs Anthony’s 
employment records showed her as having been at work at the times and 
dates that the home computer searches were made – which Mrs Anthony 
explained by saying that she went home early some days even though her 
records indicated otherwise - and asked her why she had only just 
brought up her claims three years on.

'I did tell law enforcement. In fact, I told you during my deposition in 2009 that I made those searches,' Mrs Anthony replied.

'You told me that you searched 
‘chlorophyll’ and you spelt chlorophyll for me,' Mrs Drane-Burdick shot 
back, adding: 'Did you type into the search bar of Google ‘How to make 
chloroform’?' – a reference to FBI evidence that someone typed in those 
specific words in March 2008.

'I don’t recall typing in ‘How to 
make chloroform’,' Mrs Anthony ceded, also accepting that she had not 
been responsible for other searches found by FBI computer analysts on 
the family’s home computer, such as ‘self defence,’ ‘how to make 
household weapons,’ ‘shovel’ and ‘neck breaking.’

If convicted of daughter Caylee's murder, Casey could face the death penalty

The Anthony's home computer had been used to search for terms such as 'neck breaking', 'death' and 'head injuries' as well as 'chloroform', the prosecution told the jury two weeks ago

'I didn’t search for ‘neck breaking’ 
but I do recall that there was a pop-up that was showing a YouTube 
(video) that was showing a skateboarder that was going on rails…I recall
it saying ‘a neck-breaking feat’' Mrs Anthony said.

The timing of the revelations – which
scored significant points for the defence despite some of the later 
doubts raised by prosecutors - came at an ironic time in the trial of 
Casey Anthony, who potentially faces the death penalty if convicted of 
first-degree murder. She has pleaded not guilty, claiming that little 
Caylee drowned accidentally in the family swimming pool.

Yesterday, a lawyer for Casey’s parents told CNN that the couple believe their daughter is guilty.

Asked: 'Do your clients George and 
Cindy Anthony think that she is not guilty', the couple’s lawyer Mark 
Lippman replied: 'They don’t think that…they do not believe she is 
innocent.'

He later backtracked, insisting that 
he was misunderstood. 'I’ve never said they thought she was guilty. I 
only said they have no idea what happened,' Mr Lippman said.

'They have no idea what the facts 
are. That’s why they’re sitting in the courtroom every single day. They 
hope they can get some semblance of truth. Based on his story it sounds 
like I was saying my clients think she is guilty of murder. I never said
that. And any inference to that is wrong.'

Mr Lippman added during a brief press conference outside court tonight: 'They (the Anthonys) don't know whether or not she's guilty of the crimes that have been alleged. ...She's still not guilty until the jury comes back and makes a determination of what happened. My clients want to know what happened.'

Addressing Mrs Anthony's sudden revelations about her computer searches three years on, Mr Lippman echoed his client's statement in court that she was not the one who had looked up the phrases 'How to make chloroform' or 'neck breaking' on the home computer.

But the matters she had recalled, such as her inter-connected searches on chlorophyll and chloroform, stemmed from the fact that her memory had improved since 2008 when Caylee was found dead.

'Normally as time goes on our memory gets a little bit more cloudy, but she was taking medication because of the various issues and the stress she was suffering,' he said.

'Her medication has since been changed by her doctor and it has clarified her memory from three years ago.'
