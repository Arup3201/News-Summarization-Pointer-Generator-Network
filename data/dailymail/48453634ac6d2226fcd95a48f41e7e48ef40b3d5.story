Riot police in Ukraine fell to their knees to ask for forgiveness for their colleagues who shot and beat antigovernment protesters in the recent Kiev massacre.

The extraordinary scenes in Lviv involved the Berkut elite anti-riot force whose members had returned from duty in the capital.

They apologised on a stage in front of pro-Europe protesters.

Returning from duty in Kiev, crowds greeted them with chants of 'Shame!' and 'Tribunal'

'I am asking you to forgive us,' said an officer who stood in front of other men. In memory of those who were killed, we want to kneel down.'

The officers were greeted with chants of 'Shame!' and 'Tribunal' but they stressed they had not killed or beaten people themselves.

Today it was revealed that some Berkut riot police personnel have disappeared along with weapons.

Interim Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the officers were alarmed at the prospect of an investigation into their conduct on Independence Square when dozens of protesters were killed last week.Â

'We have difficulties with the Berkut units which have been left without leadership.

'Their leadership have fled, that is why today's check up has shown that 35 persons are not at their subunit's base. This is a problem.'

In Odessa and Crimea in contrast, returning Berkut police have been cheered by crowds waving Russian flags, highlighting the deep divisions on the country over last week's events which led to a revolution and the fleeing of president Viktor Yanukovych.

Many of them carried batons and wore masks.

In Odessa, the commander of the Berkut battalion came to the crowd and shook people's hands. He asked the crowd to remain peaceful and keep public order.
