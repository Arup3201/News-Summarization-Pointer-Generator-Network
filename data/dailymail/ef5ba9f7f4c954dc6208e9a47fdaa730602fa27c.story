More than 140,000 Australians are now ditching conventional dating methods and turning to websites to find a sugar daddy or sugar baby to meet their needs.

At 25-years-old, Vanessa Marie is one of the many young women who have found a man much older than her – a 51-year-old hotel owner – to regularly shower her with gifts in exchange for her attention.

'We basically would meet up once a week for diner with drinks and for exchange I would get a weekly allowance,' Vanessa, who earns $500 a week just for her presence, told A Current Affair.

'You get spoiled and pampered, you get to basically get what you want - it's easy money I guess.'

The model echoed the sentiments of infamous sugar daddy Geoffrey Edelsten's alleged former sugar baby, Shirley Moore, who described the businessman as 'my personal ATM'.

'He's like "OK, so what do you want from me. Do you want a $100,000 a year, do you want $250,000 a year?"

'He's like "OK well, set up a bank account, I'll send you $2000 a week". I'm 21, I'm making more than people made in years.'

Nerita on the other hand, appears to be less drawn in by the money, instead seeking glamour.

Nerita, also 25, met the director of a successful Melbourne company through sugardaddymeet.com in exchange for a fancy dress and bag

The 25-year-old who works in the finance industry said that she was financially secure and successful and doesn't consider herself a gold digger.

'I've met some very lovely gentlemen so, all very good experiences so far,' Nerita said of her dating men she's met online who are up to twice her age.

'My first experience was one of the most exciting experiences I've ever had – I got a message through my inbox basically saying 'liked your profile'.

'They're very attractive, I enjoy their company, I enjoy teaching them, and I enjoy going out with them,' Geoffrey Edelsten told A Current Affair

'He's a director of a pretty successful company in Melbourne and he essentially wanted me to be his date for a company event. Along with that I got a beautiful dress, a beautiful bag out of it. I mean, who doesn't like all of that?'

But what about the well-to-do gentlemen involved in these controversial relationships, what do they get out of it?

'They're very attractive, I enjoy their company, I enjoy teaching them, and I enjoy going out with them,' Geoffrey Edelsten told A Current Affair, insisting that money was only 'a minor attraction' for the women he sees.

'He's like 'ok so what do you want from me. Do you want a $100,000 a year, do you want $250,000 a year?' He's like 'ok, well set up a bank account, I'll send you $2000 a week'. I'm 21, I'm making more than people made in years,' she said

Meanwhile, websites like sugardaddymeet.com, persuade affluent gentlemen to join their website with the message: 'Rich and successful man. Doctors, lawyers, busy professionals, benefactors. Single or married, no time for game? Looking to support and pamper women who will treat you like a king? Interested in a discreet and mutually beneficial relationship? Time to be a Sugar Daddy!'

But there's nothing to be ashamed of in the power-based relationship, according to Nerita, who saiud: 'For an older man to have a younger companion? I don't see an issue with that.'

'Honey concentrate on your own life because at the end of the day if you're paying so much attention to someone elses lifestyle, what are you really doing in your own? So, each to their own.'
