A Syrian who was interviewed by Isis to work in its media centre has revealed just how slick and well-funded its PR machine is, saying that he was offered a big salary plus perks such as a car and house - and any cameras he wanted.

Experts believe that the terrorist organisation has amassed the money necessary to run such a formidable operation partly by smuggling oil from oil fields that it’s seized.

The Syrian said he had a job interview with Isis to work in its media centre in Raqqa, Syria's capital, and that he was amazed at the salary he was offered and the equipment he would have at his disposal.

The man, who turned the job down, told
 the Financial Times: 'They offered me $1,500 a month [five times the 
average Syrian salary], plus a car, a house and all the cameras I 
needed. I remembered looking around the office. It was amazing the 
equipment they had in there.'

The U.S is becoming increasingly focussed on finding out precisely where the group's money is coming from.

Barack Obama and other leaders will discuss the issue at next week's annual United Nations General Assembly.

And
 a new U.S-based research group called the Counter Extremism Project is 
poised to release to governments and media outlets a database of 
information about militants and their supporters.

It's
 convinced that Isis is generating a great deal of wealth – it’s thought
 to have stockpiled around £1billion - from shady deals with morally 
compromised companies.

Risk
 management group Maplecroft believes that Isis controls half a dozen 
oil fields in Syria and four in Iraq, with many officials convinced it's
 making millions from smuggling barrels to Turkey, Iran and Iraq.

The group is also known to make money from kidnappings, extortion and robbery.

More
 airstrikes are expected this week against the group, and U.S. 
Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said on Face The Nation 
Sunday morning that other countries were willing to join the U.S. in 
these strikes, though she would not say what countries.

These strikes have already begun in Iraq, and been authorized to begin in Syria by Obama.

In addition, the Senate approved a bill to train and arm moderate Syrian rebels to battle Islamic State militants.

Meanwhile,
 a description of John Kerry by Isis as an ‘uncircumcised old geezer’ is
 further evidence of British involvement in the militant organisation, a
 terrorism expert has said.

Connection:
 The use of the word 'geezer' in the translation of al-Adnani's 
description of John Kerry is yet more evidence of strong ties between 
Britain and Isis, according to an expert

Low
 blow: The group called John Kerry an 'uncircumcised old geezer' after 
his comments that the terrorist organization 'did not represent Islam' 
in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee

The comment about the U.S Secretary of State came in an audio recording by Isis spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani.

He
 said: 'The uncircumcised old geezer, suddenly became an Islamic jurist,
 issuing a verdict to the people that the Islamic State was distorting 
Islam, that what it was doing was against Islamic teachings, and that 
the Islamic State was an enemy of Islam.'

Professor
 Anthony Glees, head of the centre for security and intelligence studies
 at the University of Buckingham, said the use of British slang was 
hugely significant.

He told 
MailOnline: ‘I'd say the use of the word "geezer" is a massively 
important further giveaway about the identity of some of these Isis 
thugs. It's a term most usually heard in London.

'So
 Isis have drawn us, I'd suspect intentionally, back towards reflecting 
on the fact that Brits are fighting for these sadistic butchers, 
taunting not just the families of the hostages but our government and 
our position in the world.'

Britain's
 link to Islamic State became known around the world after shocking 
videos showed a British man known as 'Jihadi John' executing American 
journalists James Foley, 40, and Steven Sotloff, 31, as well as British 
aid worker David Haines, 44.

Some sources believe that Jihadi John comes from a South London suburb about 10 miles from Central London.

Professor
 Glees added: 'It's my understanding that MI5 and the counter-terrorism 
police do know the identity of "John" but that like the UK government 
more generally they don't see any advantage at this stage in telling the
 rest of us, not so much out of consideration to "John's" family but to 
the hostages because this is about the lives of innocent hostages here, 
and every move that we take needs to be very carefully considered before
 we take it.'
