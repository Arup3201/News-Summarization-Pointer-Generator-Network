A 35-year-old teacher has been arrested after allegedly leaving her three young children home alone so she could go partying with her husband and get a tattoo.

Laura Aguero, who earns $79,000-a-year at Middle School 88 in Park Slope, Brooklyn, reportedly abandoned her sons, aged four, five and 12, at her duplex in Sunset Park on Wednesday night.

She then went to a tattoo parlor in Lower East Side to get an inking finished, before going out drinking in a nearby bar, police said. During this time, she got into a fight with her husband, Alfredo Bobe.

While the couple were out, their neighbors reportedly heard a loud crash coming from inside their home on 52nd Street near Third Avenue at around 3.15am, and called 911.

When police arrived at the property, they allegedly found the boys home alone. Forty minutes later, Aguero and Bobe stumbled up to the house and started to drunkenly fight outside the door, it is said.

At some point during their fight, Bobe, 41, reportedly smashed a front-door glass window in a bid to get into the property, according to the New York Post. However, he and Aguero were quickly arrested.

Now, Aguero, an avid bicyclist who has been a City Middle School science teacher for more than a decade, has been charged with three counts of endangering the welfare of a child.

She has also reportedly been 'reassigned away from any classroom' and banned from contact with students at Middle School 88. Bobe, meanwhile, has been charged with criminal mischief.

During the couple's night out, Aguero is believed to have got her tattoo finished at Inborn Tattoo in Lower East Side, before attending Local 138 bar’s 'Whiskey Wednesday' event.

Shockingly, in a subsequent police interview, she even reportedly admitted to officers that her night out without her children had involved being inked, according to CBS2.

In her Facebook photos, the suspect has an intricate sleeve tattoo running down her left arm, as well as further inkings around her ankles. 

During a police investigation, officers found 'clothes and garbage strewn around' the couple's filthy apartment, prosecutors said.

It is reportedly not the first time Aguero has been in trouble with the law.

In 2003, she and Bobe allegedly brawled with another couple outside a McDonald’s in Fort Greene.

And in June 2011, Aguero threw her husband's bicycle in front of a moving car after getting into an argument with him, police sources said. She was later charged with criminal mischief.  

Speaking of Aguero's latest charges, a spokesman for the Department of Education said, 'While this alleged behavior is not school-related, it is unacceptable.

'Ms. Aguero  has been reassigned away from any classroom, and will not be in contact with students. The safety and security of our students is our top priority.'

Aguero and Bobe have been released without bail and are due back in court next Thursday.

Their children are staying with relatives until authorities approve their return.
