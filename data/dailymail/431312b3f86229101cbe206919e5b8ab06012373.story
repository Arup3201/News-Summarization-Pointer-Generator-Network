Nancy Dell-Olio is seeking the advice of lawyers as she is looking for an apology for comments made about her on the BBC show

You might have thought you’d heard the last of Nancy Dell’Olio for a while after she was voted off Strictly Come Dancing.

But given her feisty reputation, she was never likely to go quietly.

She has launched a war of words with Alesha Dixon after the judge described her final performance as ‘unfeminine’.

Yesterday Miss Dell’Olio hit back by calling her ‘vulgar’.

And she has told friends she is prepared to contact lawyers in an effort to get an official apology from Miss Dixon and the BBC.

It
comes after this year’s series was blighted by accusations of producers
introducing ever more revealing costumes and vulgar routines in an 
attempt to chase ratings.

The
BBC has received more than 300 complaints about ex-footballer Robbie 
Savage’s ‘Michael Jackson-style’ hip thrusts on Saturday’s show, which 
he directed at judge Craig Revel Horwood.

Many
viewers have also complained about the plunging necklines and exposed 
flesh shown by contestants including One Show presenter Alex Jones, 34, 
and Waterloo Road actress Chelsee Healey, 23.

Miss Healey broke down in tears after
her low-cut gown slipped when she lost her footing while dancing the 
tango with partner Pasha Kovalev.

And
producers have been criticised for introducing a new camera which 
focuses on the contestants’ cleavages as they descend or mount the set’s
stairs.

Miss Dell’Olio, 50,
was widely mocked by the judges for her rumba with Anton Du Beke on 
this weekend’s Halloween special, in which she wore a revealing white 
and silver dress and flashed her underwear as she clambered out of a 
sequined coffin.

Miss Dixon, 33, a former winner of the show, said of the performance: ‘Nancy, I think you are a sexy woman and you know how to work it but I have to be honest – you are a walking disaster.

‘Your legs are so far apart and that’s not very feminine. You both should have stayed in the coffin!’

On BBC Breakfast yesterday, Miss Dell’Olio said the show had been left bare without her, adding: ‘It’s like a Christmas tree without the lights.’

And referring to Miss Dixon, the only female judge on the Strictly panel, she said: ‘Some of the comments, especially when something comes from a woman to another woman, she has to think about it.

‘She was not elegant, she was a little bit vulgar. There is a fine line between entertainment and then unnecessary comments.’

Presenter Sian Williams then interjected: ‘Alesha did say you are very  sexy…’ to which Miss Dell’Olio retorted: ‘Well everyone knows that, it’s  quite evident.’

But she admitted: ‘If you do a show like this you can’t take anything personally, you have to take a risk for entertainment.’

Seemingly joking, she added: ‘I don’t think it was personal otherwise they would be having legal action immediately from my lawyers.’

Robbie Savage performed odd pelvic-thrusting on the show, much like Michael Jackson use to do

However last night a close friend told the Daily Mail: ‘Nancy was really hurt by Alesha’s comments.

‘The way she looks is, of course, a massive part of her personality.

‘She doesn’t mind her dancing being criticised, but she took Alesha’s remarks about her legs as a massive slap in the face.

'She felt it was really nasty to be trashed in front of millions of viewers and she wants  an apology – and she’s talking to lawyers to find out the best way to get one.’

The friend added: ‘Anton is also appalled.’

Miss Dell’Olio had already been ogled by head judge Len Goodman when she danced the salsa in an earlier show, when he told her: ‘The most exciting part was when I took a crafty look up your skirt.’

Miss Dell’Olio’s spokesman said last night: ‘Nancy is now looking at her options as to how to get an apology from Alesha and the BBC.’

Yesterday Savage also hit back at criticism of his routine, writing on Twitter: ‘So some people thought it was inappropriate to do a Michael Jackson move at 7pm on a Saturday night to one of his songs! Why?’

Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘The judges always look to give constructive criticism and this is often delivered with humour given that Strictly is an entertainment show. Alesha’s comments were not meant to cause any offence.’
