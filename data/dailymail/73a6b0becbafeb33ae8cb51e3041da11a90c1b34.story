One Boston Celtics fan was left green with envy as he lost two battles against the Chicago Bulls during their NBA clash on Saturday night.

Not only did the fan see his side beaten by their Eastern Conference rivals, but he was also defeated and humiliated by the hosts' mascot Benny the Bull after a Kiss Cam row.

Ahead of the fourth quarter at the United Center, Kiss Cam was deployed, as spectators were picked out to share a smooch with their loved ones.

As the camera panned to couples kissing, one Boston fan was clearly uninterested in the fun as he enjoyed a conversation on his mobile - much to his female partner's annoyance.

The Kiss Cam repeatedly came back to the couple in the hope they would lock lips.

Seeing the woman snubbed several times, Bulls mascot Benny the Bull came to her rescue in a hilarious act of chivalry.

Charging over to their seats, the bull literally saw red as he poured a drink over the man before whisking his partner away, much to the delight of the crowd.

Although the stunt was reportedly staged, it was still a crowd-pleasing moment.

And come the end of the game the home fans were in a jubilant mood once more as they ran out 109-104 winners in overtime.

Forward Pau Gasol top scored for the Bulls with 19 points as fellow stars Joakim Noah and Derrick Rose contributed with eight and 12 points.
