Just 48 hours before the G20 leader's meeting kicks off, Queensland police said they have not received a request from any foreign security services to carry guns in Australia.

Deputy Police Commissioner Ross Barnett said authorities have yet to receive a request from the typically armed to the teeth US Secret Service that guards President Barack Obama or any guards Russian president Vladimir Putin or another world leader may hope to bring.

Mr Barnett said: 'At the moment no formal application has been made to the commissioner for any foreign service personnel to carry firearms in Queensland.'

He said requests had to be made to the Federal government who forward them on to the police commissioner, who has the 'final say' on who carries weapons in the state.

The expected size of President Obama's entourage is not yet clear but he is typically accompanied overseas by a small army of Secret Service personnel and a considerable motorcade.
