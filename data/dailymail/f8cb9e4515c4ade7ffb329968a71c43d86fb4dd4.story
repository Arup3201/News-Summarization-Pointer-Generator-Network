Wayne Rooney is now only three short of Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring record after his double in England's 3-1 victory over Scotland on Tuesday night. 

Sportsmail columnist and Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher says he is an England ‘great’, but former Liverpool and Scotland captain Graeme Souness claims his two-goal salvo was only ‘against Championship players, so don’t get carried away’.

So, is a Rooney ‘a great’ - and what constitutes a ‘great’ England player? We asked our team of reporters for their verdict.

Rooney's two-goal salvo against Scotland has taken him to within three of Sir Bobby Charlton's record 

LEE CLAYTON, HEAD OF SPORT 

Yes he is! These days we live in a world where everyone likes to take a sledgehammer to anything positive and everyone has a platform to be nasty. If Twitter was around in the 1960s, Bobby Charlton would be ‘too slow’, Jimmy Greaves wouldn’t be able to play as a lone striker in a 4-5-1, Bobby Moore wouldn’t be strong enough in the air… 

Rooney is the greatest England player of his generation and has been let down by poor team-mates. He’s scored 46 goals, we will miss him when he is gone. Kevin Keegan was the best England player I saw in the flesh. He was a ‘great’, a double European Footballer of the Year - and Rooney is as good as Keegan (and has scored a lot more goals).

MATT LAWTON  

Rooney is the best English player of a generation and has won numerous honours with Manchester United, but as an England player will he stand shoulder to shoulder with Bobby Charlton and Gary Lineker when he overtakes them in the goalscoring charts? For me, I'm afraid it's a no at the moment.

IAN LADYMAN  

I’m an enduring fan of Rooney and he has played a central role in achieving great things during his 10 years at Old Trafford. Sadly, he has never really had the platform to do the same with England and – largely because of injury – has never really been able to make a consistent impact at major tournaments.

For me, great England players are those who have given me great England memories. Rooney hasn’t given me enough of these, so he falls short I am afraid.

Let's use Sir Bobby Charlton as the barometer for greatness. He was in four World Cup squads, has more than 100 caps and 49 England goals. Rooney has been to three World Cups, has more than 100 caps and now has 46 goals. He will become the country's leading scorer, he could play in a fourth World Cup and his place in the squad is beyond doubt at the moment, so he will go on winning caps. 

We can become too dewy-eyed looking back at former players in comparison with what those of the present are achieving.

Rooney might not have become the player everyone expected when he was 18 but he has still been outstanding. He ticks all the boxes needed to be classed as an England great.

JAMIE CARRAGHER: He will become the greatest goalscorer for England, there is no doubt about that. He’ll possibly beat the caps record as well. 

All week we have been saying, 'Is he an England great?' 'Where does he rank?' Of course he is an England great, he is going to be our greatest goalscorer.

Is he a world great? Is he Messi, Ronaldo? No, he’s not, but over these last 12-18 months there have been questions asked about Wayne Rooney. You go back to the World Cup and people didn’t even want him in the team. Absolute nonsense. He should always be in the England team.

GRAEME SOUNESS: I would not get carried away with Rooney. He is just scoring goals against Championship players tonight. I agree with your first part where you say Rooney has been a great player for England, but what adjective do you use to describe Rooney if you are using ‘great'? Messi and Ronaldo are on different planets. 

Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness were speaking on Sky Sports 

ROB DRAPER

Jamie Carragher nailed it: of course he is an England 'great'. But is he one of the 'great' players of this generation? No. 

It's a tough era in which to shine, what with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo but Luis Suarez, Neymar, Sergio Aguero, Zlatan Ibrahimovic are also better in his position. And that's before you start adding in great defenders and midfielders. But he is a very good player, world class and the dominant force for England. We should be grateful to have him.

MATT BARLOW

Yes he is an England great. I don't think that can be debated. Youngest goalscorer, 101 caps and only serious injury can stop him passing Sir Bobby Charlton's long standing 49-goal record.

Levels of greatness? Well, he has not conquered the world. He will not go down as a world great with Pele, Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff, Zinedine Zidane et al. There's no shame in that. 

He has not won anything with England but only one team ever has, nearly 50 years ago.

In the modern world of intense professional scrutiny, you might question if his lifestyle prevented him from maximising his full potential but he has been the best of his generation by some distance.

SAMI MOKBEL

Is Wayne Rooney an England great? I can't believe we are even having this debate. Of course he is. Just look at his goal record; 46 in 101 caps. What else does he have to do? That's almost one in two for England - that goal ratio is excellent in anyone's book.

His failure, so far, to produce for England in a major tournament since Euro 2004 is perhaps the main reason why the jury's still out for some people. But, for me, there's no argument.

CRAIG HOPE

The fact we’re having this debate – given his brilliant caps and goals record – proves there is something which just doesn’t sit right with Rooney. 

For me, the source of this unease is his failure to develop himself into the world ‘great’ we all thought he would be – we’re talking Ronaldo and Messi territory. And that, too, seems a source of frustration for the player - he is, after all, the perennial angry man.

In an England shirt his record at major tournaments – barring Euro 2004 – is well documented and there has been no real magic memory in the best part of a decade for his country. And look at his goals record – he has scored four times against what you would call the very best international teams (Brazil twice, Argentina and Holland) but they were all in friendlies. Sadly, I just can’t have him as an England great.

MARTHA KELNER

Rooney is a great player, a great servant to Manchester United and increasingly a great figure in the game. He has approached the possibility of breaking Sir Bobby Charlton's record with real class. But he is not an England great because - often for reasons beyond his control - he has not delivered consistently at major tournaments. Maybe, as Roy Hodgson believes, we have not seen the best of Rooney yet and he might go on to legitimately become an England great. But he's not there yet.

SAM CUNNINGHAM

Rooney will undoubtedly go on to become England's top scorer, but so far only six of those have come at major tournaments – five in European Championships and a meagre one at a World Cup.

Scroll through his list of England goals and I can pick out just five that have been scored against what would be considered the real big guns – one versus Argentina, Holland and two against Brazil, all in friendlies, and one against Uruguay at this summer's World Cup.

His trophy cabinet is crammed full of club silverware, but at present he is an exceptional player who is far from the realms of greatness. 

JOE BERNSTEIN

I wouldn't put him anywhere near an all-time England XI. He can't compare with Geoff Hurst (hat-trick in a World Cup final), Gary Lineker (World Cup golden boot), Alan Shearer (leading scorer at Euro 96) or even had a similar impact to Jimmy Greaves or Michael Owen. So in that respect he's not really a great. 

His longevity is impressive, a lot of players who start young burn out. But he's got to do it in a big match to cement his place among the pantheons; a free-kick against Estonia, penalty against Slovenia and a couple of goals in a friendly against Scotland don't really cut it when you think of Owen sprinting past Argentina defenders to score a World Cup classic in a match that mattered.
