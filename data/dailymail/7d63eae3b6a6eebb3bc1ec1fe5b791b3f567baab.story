Sunderland winger Adam Johnson is keeping fit by training at his mansion with a coach from the club,Sportsmail understands.

The 27-year-old, arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl, has been suspended by the Premier League strugglers pending the outcome of a police investigation.

However, the Black Cats are sending a fitness coach to Johnson’s two-acre woodland pad to oversee private workouts.

The player is understood to have told Sunderland, who appointed Dick Advocaat as new manager on Tuesday following the dismissal of Gus Poyet, that he is innocent.

And while publicly club officials moved to suspend him, privately they want to keep him fit in the event that he is cleared in time to join their fight against relegation.

A source said: ‘There’s a fitness coach going pretty much every day. The idea is to keep him ready so that if the allegations are dropped he can go straight back into the side.’

The gates at Johnson's £1.85million were shut following his arrest earlier this month

Johnson was arrested on March 2.

Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothes officers and a forensics team were seen at Johnson’s luxurious £1.85m house, close to a quiet hamlet in County Durham, and he was questioned at Peterlee police station before being bailed until March 18.

That has now been extended and he will report back to police on April 23.

As revealed by Sportsmail, as part of the probe, officers also turned up at the Stadium of Light and the 60-acre Academy of Light and scoured both dressing rooms as part of their hunt for evidence.

All Sunderland staff were called to meetings following the arrest and warned away from posting anything about it on social media and from speaking to the press.

Sunderland-born Johnson, whose long-time girlfriend Stacey Flounders gave birth to daughter Ayla Sofia in January, signed for the club for £10m from Manchester City in 2012.

He has played 12 times for England.
