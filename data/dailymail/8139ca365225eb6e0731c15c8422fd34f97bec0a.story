A Caribbean café owner was sent an eye-watering tax bill for almost £1billion, it was revealed today.

Florence Coke, 59, owner of Mama Flo’s in Gorton, Greater Manchester, said she ‘nearly fell over’ after opening the £979,092,858 bill from HM Revenue and Customs in Southend-on-Sea, Essex.

She was left angry after the taxman threatened to seize her business assets if she failed to pay up – but HMRC bosses have since apologised after realising Ms Coke only owed a little less than £17,000.

Shocked: Florence Coke, 59, owner of Mama Flo’s in Gorton, Greater Manchester, told how she 'nearly fell over' after opening the £979,092,858 bill from HM Revenue and Customs

Ms Coke, who lives above the café, said it ‘frightened the hell out of me’ when the bill arrived.

She added: This is my first time in business and I am naive, I didn’t know where to turn. It really shook me up. This is a little café and takeaway in Gorton - not a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.’

Ms Coke opened Mama Flo’s three years ago after working on the perfume counter at Selfridges and as a newspaper street vendor. She received the astonishing bill from HMRC in March.

The letter, signed by an HMRC debt collector, said: ‘If you do not pay or contact us, we can visit your premises in order to arrange for your assets to be sold by public auction.’

Ms Coke immediately called HMRC - who said they would investigate the matter.

'I’m a woman running this business on my own and put all the hours in just to get by - and they send me a letter threatening to take everything away unless I pay £1billion'

The cafe owner said she accepted the apology, but added: ‘I’m still angry about it. I can’t believe someone in that office would send that out. I don’t even get a wage from the café.

‘I’m a woman running this business on my own and put all the hours in just to get by - and they send me a letter threatening to take everything away unless I pay £1billion.’

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We are very sorry to hear of the problems our customer has had.

‘We cannot comment on individual cases - but when mistakes do happen our aim is to always put them right as soon as we can and apologise for any inconvenience caused.’
