A mother who asked to change her baby in a restaurant toilet claims she was told she would have to go to a nearby Tesco instead.

Helen Quinnell took her eight-month-old daughter Molly to the toilets into Cafe Tusk, in Fareham, Hampshire, to change her nappy.

Because the Indian restaurant does not have dedicated baby-change facilities, she asked the manager if she could use the ladies toilets, instead using the changing mat she had with her.

Helen Quinnell took her eight-month-old daughter Molly to the toilets into Cafe Tusk, in Fareham, Hampshire, to change her nappy, while she and her husband enjoyed a meal at the Indian restaurant

But she claims she was told that she couldn't - and was instead told that if she wanted to change her baby's nappy, she should use the facilities at a nearby Tesco supermarket.

The 35-year-old, who was with her husband Daniel, 30, and her sister Christelle Fowler, said the group paid and left, but vowed never to go back.

She said she was left shocked and embarrassed by the incident.Â 

Mrs Quinell said: 'The manager said "we don't allow it." I came out to my sister in shock and said "they won't let me change my baby".

Because the Indian restaurant does not have dedicated baby-change facilities, she asked the manager if she could use the ladies toilets using the changing mat she had with her. She claims she was told no

'I couldn't believe it and I wouldn't go back there again ever.

'It made me feel really insecure. Never in my life would I leave a dirty baby.'

Restaurant manager Mosud Ahmed apologised and said the incident was a misunderstanding.

He added: 'It is a misunderstanding. We do not have a baby change room but most people change in the ladies, so we let them do it.

'The waiter was just trying to say that there is a dedicated baby change room at Tesco if they preferred.

'They can change in the toilet but there is not much room. We have a ladies, a gents and a disabled but no baby-change room.

'There are lots of families that have come in here and nobody has complained in nine years.'

Mr Ahmed said that he has spoken to the staff in question and that he will be installing a baby change unit.

He said: 'I will put a baby change unit in then it will be easier in future.'

Mrs Quinnell, who is staying with her sister in Portsmouth, added: 'It's good that they are making changes but I am still shocked by what happened.'
