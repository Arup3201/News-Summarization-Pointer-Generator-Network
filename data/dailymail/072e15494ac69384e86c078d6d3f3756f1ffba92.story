Feckless absent fathers should be put to work ‘in chains’ to repay the State for the cost of bringing up their children, a Conservative MP said yesterday.

David Davies told MPs that it was ‘outrageous’ that some young men got women pregnant before leaving them to bring up their babies on their own on benefits.

He made his demand in a Commons debate in which Labour launched more attacks on the Government’s attempt to cut the vast housing benefit bill.

Outspoken: Tory MP David Davies said feckless fathers should be locked in chains and made to work to pay for the children they abandoned

Labour work and pensions spokesman 
Rachel Reeves, calling for a vote on the Coalition’s reform of the spare
 room subsidy – branded the ‘bedroom tax’ by Labour – said vulnerable 
people were being unfairly targeted.

But
 Mr Davies, the MP for Monmouth, said he had met a woman bringing up 
four grandchildren and that the children’s mother was going to lose out 
on housing benefit because she was not their main carer.

Mr Davies said the women essentially wanted ‘two large houses’ in which to look after the same children.

‘I
 think it is absolutely outrageous that so many young men in our society
 feel they can go out, get women pregnant, allow them to have children, 
make them bring them up by themselves, very often on benefits, and then 
disappear,’ he said.

‘I 
hope that the ministers will take note of this and get hold of some of 
these feckless fathers, drag them off, make them work, put them in 
chains if necessary, make them work and make them pay back society for 
the cost of bringing up the children they chose to bring into this 
world.’

Stephen Pound, 
the Northern Ireland spokesman for Labour, said the reform was ‘beyond 
disgrace’ and revealed his brother, who has kidney failure, faces losing
 his home of 20 years.

Miss
 Reeves said a Labour government would scrap the reform. ‘If I am 
Secretary of State in 2015 this will be the first thing I will do – 
reverse this unfair and pernicious tax,’ she said.

She
 criticised Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith for missing 
the debate to attend a conference in Paris on youth employment.

David Davis, who is definitely not David TC Davies

David Davies is probably best known for not being David Davis.

The Welsh politician is frequently confused with his near-namesake (inset), who lost out to David Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005.

As a result he uses his middle initials TC in Parliament, earning the nickname ‘Top Cat’.

Mr Davies, the Monmouth MP, has never reached the Tory frontline, at odds with the leadership on many issues.

The fluent Welsh-speaking was born in London and grew up in Newport, working for British Steel and the Territorial Army before travelling around Australia where he picked tobacco and ran a nightclub.

He ran a campaign against the Welsh Assembly being set up, but then stood for election to it and became the only Tory to win a constituency seat.

The Special Constable was elected as MP for Monmouth in 2005, and has called for Britain to leave the EU, expressed doubts about climate change and argued people who come to Britain should learn English and be fit to work.

In 2010 he accused the Labour party of trying to smear him as a ‘Nazi’.

Last year he insisted he is not homophobic – because he once fought a gay boxer with the nickname the Pink Pounder.

He had claimed that parents hoped for heterosexual children because they wanted grandchildren.

But
 Mr Duncan Smith, writing on the ConservativeHome  website, said: ‘We’ve
 ended the thoroughly unfair subsidy that saw the taxpayer forking out  
for almost one million spare  bedrooms in the social rented sector.’

He
 said that 54 per cent of the public agreed that people of working age 
who lived in social housing should receive less housing benefit if they 
had more bedrooms than they needed.

Under
 the reform, working-age claimants with extra bedrooms are having their 
housing benefit cut by 14 per cent for the first excess bedroom and 25 
per cent for two or more bedrooms.

Pensioners are protected and those who cannot move or cannot afford the extra cost can apply for discretionary payments.

The Government estimates the reform will cost the average affected household £14 a week, saving £500million a year.
