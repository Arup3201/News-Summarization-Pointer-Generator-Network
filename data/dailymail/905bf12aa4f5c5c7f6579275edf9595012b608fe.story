An electrician accused of murdering his girlfriend by stamping on her head when she refused to give him her Facebook password claimed they would often use each other's accounts to play Candy Crush saga. 

Kane Boyce, 34, allegedly killed 20 year-old Paula Newman at the home they shared in Croydon in South London, when she stopped him from reading her online messages after becoming obsessed with the idea she was cheating on him.

Boyce has denied the murder of his girlfriend, and has previously claimed she fell out of his BMW during a late night drive.

He admitted pushing her over the evening before she died during an argument in the street, after he claimed she accused him of having an affair. He told the court she fell over and he helped her back into the car. 

The 34-year-old told a hearing at the Old Bailey that the couple both regularly accessed each other's Facebook accounts to give eachother extra lives to play Candy Crush saga, a mobile phone game.

‘You get four lives an hour or something,’ he added. ‘I went on her phone to send myself a life so I could carry on playing.’

He added: ‘Yes we knew each other’s passwords because we would often send each other lives on that game we used to play.' 

Boyce said while he was on Facebook he noticed Miss Newman had been sending messages to an ex-boyfriend, in which she referred to Boyce as an a*******. 

He admitted to the court that he was upset over the message and took a screenshot to post it to his own account, so people would see 'there was another side to her.'  He also said they had had used her account to send messages to his girlfriend's former partner. 

Boyce admitted pushing Miss Newman over during an argument in the street on the evening before she died.

He said Miss Newman accused him of sleeping with 'a tart' as they drove around the area off Lodge Lane in New Addington.

'Paula was shouting at me to stop the car. I just carried on,' he said.

'She started lunging at me to grab the wheel. I felt a blow to my face. In order to get her off me I struck out with my hand.'

He said the argument continued after he stopped the car near some garages.

'She was still saying I was sleeping with that tart. I said the only reasons she is saying that is because she has been talking to people on Facebook as well.'

He said he shouted at her: 'Log on or give me back my phone'.

Boyce added: 'She had my phone, she was using it to log into her emails.'

However the prosecution claim he shouted: 'If you don't log on we will see what happens.'

He said he got out of his car and followed Miss Newman to Parkway and told her to calm down and come home.

'She tried pushing past me. I pushed her quite hard and she stumbled back and she banged herself on the side of the garages.

'It was just like she fainted. She fell over. I wasn't expecting her to fall into the garages.

'I didn't intend for any of it. I helped her up and took her back to the car.'

Boyce told the court he would go on his girlfriend's account to give himself more lives to play Candy Crush 

Ms Newman was taken to hospital on the morning of 12 November 2013 but died later the same day.

A previous hearing was told that a post mortem found she had died of head injuries. 

The trial was previously told that in the weeks before her death Boyce became obsessed with checking his girlfriend's Facebook account. He was described as manipulative and having a history of violence against women. 

Boyce admitted he had previous convictions for assault and harassment against a former partner but added: ‘I was quite young and immature.’

After this he married another woman but met Ms Newman after moving out of the marital home into a friend’s house in around March 2013.

Boyce said they started a relationship after around six or seven weeks and added: ‘I did love her. It was hard but I loved her and I think she loved me as well.’

He claimed they went out nightfishing and on his superbike together. 

But he denied keeping her in the house so she could not go out.

He was also asked about abusive messages the pair sent each other, and said: ‘We used to watch box sets of Shameless, our language did come from there. It wasn’t always like that.’

The pair had been together just seven months when Miss Newman died.  

Boyce, from Erith, southeast London, denies murder.

The trial continues.
