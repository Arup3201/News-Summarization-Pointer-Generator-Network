As all mothers know, losing baby weight is a tricky task - especially if you've had four children in quick succession and your body doesn't get the chance to spring back into shape.

That's exactly what happened to Emma Maxwell, 33, from Lancaster, who watched her weight shoot up to 14st 13lb and her figure to a size 20 through a combination of baby weight, poor diet and bad eating habits.

At the same time, her mother Linda Atkinson was also gradually gaining weight, suddenly discovering herself to be a dress size 18 at 12st 11lb.

Mother knows best: Mother and daughter pair Emma Maxwell, left, and Linda Atkinson, right, with Emma's four children, before they lost 10 stone between them

Looking good and feeling great: Linda, left, lost three stone, while Emma, right, lost six

So the mother and daughter pair decided to spur each other on by losing weight together, and as a team they have lost a combined total of 10 stone.

Until she had her four children Emma was always a size 10 to 12. But after giving birth the mother found a healthy diet impossible to stick to

She said: 'I used to eat a lot of takeaways, biscuits, crisps and sandwiches - anything I could grab while I was on the go.'

Not want to be the largest mother in the playground when her children went to school, Emma enlisted her mother Linda for extra support and the pair joined their 
local Rosemary Conley Diet & 
Fitness Club.

Thanks to her mother's moral support, Emma has 
succeeded in shedding six stone to now weigh 8st 13lb, a 
svelte size 8 to10, while Linda has dropped thee stone to weigh just 
9st 9lb, a dress size 10 to 12.

Being slimmer and fitter has had a massive impact on Emma's lifestyle: 'Everything about my life has improved. 

'I can now run around after my children, I enjoy taking them swimming, enjoy relaxing by the pool on holiday and, above all, I have my self-confidence and body back!

'I’m so glad I enrolled with mum because we've been able to encourage each other.  We couldn’t have done it without each other's support.'

And after feeling fitter than she had done in 30 years, Linda was able to up her exercise to four classes a week, to get to her final weight of 9st 9lb, which she has now maintained for a year.
