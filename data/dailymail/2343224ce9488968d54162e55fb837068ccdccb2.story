Ted Cruz, the ultra-conservative Freshman senator from Texas, joined other prominent Republicans in Iowa this weekend leading many to speculate that he is looking at a run for president in 2016.

Iowa is the first state to hold primary elections, which makes it a popular stop for prospective runners to familiarize themselves with the locals.

In an interview with ABC News, Cruz dodged the 2016 question.

Potential candidate: U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was in Iowa this weekend for a Republican Party fundraiser, and his presence may indicate that he's eyeing a presidential run in 2016

'I'm not focused on the politics...the last office I was elected to was student council. So this has been a bit of a whirlwind,' Cruz said.

But many are questioning whether the staunch conservative is even eligible for the office, since Cruz was born in Canada.

The U.S. constitution states that only 'natural born citizens' are eligible to occupy the office of president - a term that the constitution does not define. 

Though he was born on foreign soil, both of his parents were U.S. citizens which would have automatically made him a citizen as well.

And though he walked around the presidential run question, he did seem confident in his eligibility.

'My mother was born in Wilmington, Delaware. She was a U.S. citizen, so I'm a U.S. citizen,' he said.

Cruz said he would not engage in a legal debate about his citizenship.

'The facts are clear,' Cruz said. 'I can tell you where I was born and who my parents were. And then as a legal matter, others can worry about that.'

There has been debate over whether children of American parents born outside of the country are officially natural born citizens.

For example, Arizona Senator John McCain faced similar questions about his eligibility for the office of president since he was born on a naval base in the Panama Canal Zone. 

Since McCain was taken seriously as a candidate in 2008, Cruz's Canadian birth might not be an issue.

But his foreign birth, and the fact that his father emigrated from Cuba, are interesting in the perspective of Cruz's opposition to immigration reform.

Cruz has been an outspoken critic of the immigration bill currently going through Congress, especially the fact that it opens up a pathway to citizenship for the millions of illegal immigrants currently living in the U.S. 

The bill is being pushed by Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio - another early contender for the Republican nomination.

'I think a path to citizenship for those who are here illegally is profoundly unfair to the millions of legal immigrants who followed the rules,' Cruz said.

Cruz has only been in the Senate for six months, drawing comparisons to President Obama who was only a freshman Senator when he was considered in 2004 as a possible contender for the 2008 elections.

In his brief career as a senator, Cruz has become a controversial figure in congress - alienating senators in both parties for his confrontational style.

Cruz is an opponent to abortion and a supporter of the second-amendment right to bear arms. He believes that President Obama used the school shooting in Sandy Hook as an 'excuse' to push an anti-gun agenda. 

Conservative to the core: Cruz is unapologetically conservative. He's pro-life and a supporter of the second amendment right to bear arms

He believes the reason Obama was elected in 2008 was because Republicans had lost their way and weren't standing by their principles.

In order to win the White House in 2016, Cruz believes the party needs a candidate who is fiercely conservative.

'If you look at the last 40 years, a consistent pattern emerges. Anytime Republicans nominate a candidate for president who runs as a strong conservative, we win.  And when we nominate a moderate who doesn't run as a conservative, we lose.'
