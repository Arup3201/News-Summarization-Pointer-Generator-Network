A man who had never weighed himself told how an unflattering wedding photograph forced him to shed half his bodyweight.

Andrew Montgomery, 34, tipped the scales at 30 stone after a decade of unhealthy living that saw him gorge on a diet of junk food and unhealthy snacks.

He had a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 60.26 - a healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 25 - putting him in the morbidly obese category, and could not climb a single flight of stairs without panting.

But is was only when he saw pictures of himself dwarfing a slim size 8 bridesmaid at a friend's wedding that he finally realised he had a serious weight problem.

Drastic measures: 34-year-old Andrew, far left, bought a treadmill and consumed just 500 calories a day to shed the weight, before embarking upon a healthy eating plan

In a bid to fight the pounds Andrew, from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, joined an online weight loss site called Lighter Life last January.

He bought a treadmill and consumed just 500 calories a day, living on milkshakes, soup and cereal bars, before eating a balanced diet after ten months.

He has since lost 15 stone and is hoping his new physique will be the boost he needs to help him find a wife this year.

The agricultural contractor said: 'I 
couldn't avoid the pictures and it was a shock to see how huge I looked 
next to a size eight bridesmaid.

Wake-up call: Andrew had never weighed himself, saying he didn't realise how big he really was

'I had never weighed myself and I didn't realise how big I was until I could see myself compared to other people.

'That was the wake-up call I needed.

'I realised I could no longer avoid 
my weight issues and that if I didn't do something about it I might 
never find someone who wanted to walk down the aisle with me.'

Andrew was best man at his friend's nuptials in June 2009, attending the wedding in a huge suit.

Later in the evening he joined the wedding party on the dance floor and was photographed with bridesmaid Hayley Doyle, who was a slim size eight.

When pictures emerged he was horrified to see how he dwarfed her petite frame.

For the first time he decided to step on the scales and was shocked to discover
he weighed more than 30 stone.

Believing he would never find love at such a weight he vowed to shed the pounds as a New Years resolution.

After shedding 15 stone in 12 months, Andrew is hoping to move out of the home 
he shares with his mother Mary, 60, who desperately tried to encourage him to be more healthy.

She said: 'I used to be terrified that 
Andrew wouldn't wake up in the morning - he was miserable, our 
relationship was in tatters and I never thought he'd get and girlfriend 
and move out.

'Now all he needs is to find a nice girl to sweep off her feet - let's see what the New Year brings.'
