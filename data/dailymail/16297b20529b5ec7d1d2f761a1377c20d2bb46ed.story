A 27-year-old Chinese man had a one and a half stone (10kg) tumour on his back and neck.

Yang Xiao, from Xi'an in Shaanxi province, had the tumour since he was a teenager and it grew steadily until he had it removed last week.

He was warned surgery would be risky but that without it the tumour would continue to grow.

Yang Xiao (pictured before his operation), 27, from China, had a huge tumour on his back and neck. It weighed a stone and a half (10kg)

Mr Yang developed a small tumour on his neck about ten years ago.

It grew rapidly and was soon as big as an egg.

In 2007, he went to hospital in Xi’an and the tumour was diagnosed as fibromatosis – a benign soft tissue tumour.

Mr Yang and his father, Yang Jigao, considered surgery and were warned it was difficult and risky.

As a result, his father, who had already lost his wife and daughter, decided not to take the risk.

After leaving the hospital, Mr Yang’s tumour continued to grow.

Mr Yang first developed a small tumour on his neck when he was a teenager but it grew rapidly

Mr Yang considered having surgery in 2007 but his father did not want him to as he was warned it was risky and he had already lost his wife and daughter so couldn't face losing his son as well

It was soon as large as half a football and more tumours had appeared on his back and collarbone.

At the end of 2013 the father and son returned to hospital – this time they went to Xijing Hospital, in Xi’an.

By this point the tumour on Mr Yang’s back measured 45cm from top to bottom and 30cm across.

It was also 17cm thick and weighed a stone and a half.

Surgeons informed Mr Yang that surgery would be risky but that he would have a good chance of recovery.

Mr Yang's tumour was still growing so he eventually decided to have surgery and raised the money for an operation. He was warned it would be difficult but told he has a good chance of recovery

They also explained that without surgery the tumours would probably grow fast.

As a result, he and his father decided he should undergo surgery.

People from his hometown have donated about £2,000, and his father borrowed £10,000, to pay for the operation.

The surgery took place on February 19 - it took nine hours.

Mr Yang is still being treated at the hospital.

Fibromatosis refers to a group of benign soft tissue tumours.

The tumours are rare but often grow aggressively and frequently return after they have been removed.
