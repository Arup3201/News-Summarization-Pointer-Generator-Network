The schoolboy killer of teacher Ann Maguire tried to talk his girlfriend into joining him on a killing spree and then going on the run together.

Will Cornick - jailed for life last week for stabbing his Spanish teacher to death - wanted the pair to commit murder and spoke endlessly to her about killing Mrs Maguire and the feeling of power it would give him.

As well as bringing her into his world of sick fantasies, the 16-year-old would also cut himself with a knife in front of her and regularly ask if he could do the same to her.

Sick fantasy: The ex-girlfriend of schoolboy killer Will Cornick says he tried to persuade her to join him on a murder spree, telling her the two could then go on the run

Speaking to the Sunday People, the girl said: 'He said I understood him and that it would be great if we could carry out a murder together. 

'When we did meet up he would talk endlessly about death and Mrs Maguire and wanting to commit a murder and the feeling of power it would give him.

'He sometimes brought knives into school and he would draw them up and down his arm – ­breaking the skin and letting it bleed. He asked if he could do it to me but it scared me and I began to make excuses not to see him at break.'

Cornick attacked Mrs Maguire after boasting to friends that he was going to kill her. He also said he was going to murder other teachers, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’.

He later told doctors: ‘I said I was going to do other stuff but I never got the chance, other murders. It was a triple homicide.’

After the murder the teenager told psychiatrists that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’ 

The former girlfriend started seeing Cornick in January but managed to dump him just two months before the disturbed teenager committed murder in front of horrified classmates.

The girl, who will not be named, claims their six-week relationship began because they were both loners at Corpus Christi College in Leeds.

Hatred: Corrnick would tell other classmates that he wanted to kill Mrs Maguire and often brought knives into school

Unlike other pupils who listened to popular chart music, such as Taylor Swift, the isolated pair enjoyed heavy metal bands and alternative rock.

Their brief relationship started after Cornick approached her one day when she was sitting on her own in a school field. 

The pair would chat to each other a lot, and while initially the subject of conversation was music, Cornick soon began telling her how much he hated the school's teachers - especially Mrs Maguire.

She believes the popular 61-year-old, who has been called the 'mother of the school', was killed because she was being tough on Cornick in a bid to unlock his potential.

Last week, former student Tom Smith referred to the twisted killer as 'the most intelligent person I knew'.

Cornick's former girlfriend says that - despite this intelligence - he did not realise Mrs Maguire was trying to help him and became consumed by his hatred for her.

The girl, who decided to leave the school following the tragedy, has also spoken of how they had secret meetings away from other classmates - who thought of Cornick as a 'weirdo'.

While they sometimes hugged and held hands, she claims there was no real connection between them and says 'freaky' Cornick would keep his eyes open as they kissed.

After the teenager's sentencing last week, other classmates spoke of how the 'typical, nice, lad' had begun to show signs of change in the months leading up to the murder.

As one pupil said: ‘The Grim Reaper was the first thing you saw on his [Facebook] page.

Stable life: Far from being having an unhappy upbringing, Cornick, depicted in a court sketch, comes from a middleclass background and his parents have been described as loving and supportive

‘That corrected everyone’s opinion. [I thought] what the hell has happened, something has definitely gone wrong.’

Friends had started to think of him as a ‘loner and weirdo’ and ‘disturbing’ aspects of his personality became apparent.

He spoke openly about murdering his teacher, messaging a friend on Facebook about brutally killing her and spending the rest of his life in jail.

But no one - including his former girlfriend - believed he was capable of carrying out such psychotic threats. 

After the murder it was revealed that he had numerous images of knives on his mobile phone.

He also had a keen interest in ultra-violent video games, including Dark Souls II, in which players hack zombies to pieces.

Players devour the souls of their fallen enemies to the sound of cries of agony. Disturbing images include a character made up of hundreds of human corpses. It was voted one of the ten Most Violent Video Games of 2014.

One pupil recalled Cornick saying disgusting things at a party. He said: ‘He was saying twisted stuff like “imagine jumping on a pregnant woman and seeing the baby come out”, and saying horrible stuff about cancer and stuff like that.

‘He was just saying it in conversation. He thought it was normal but it’s not. He wasn’t normal in the head.’ But for a long time Cornick had been able to hide his ‘anger’ from others by maintaining an appearance of normality.

The teenager later confessed to a psychiatrist that the killing had been on his mind for three years, and one expert said he had engaged in a ‘considerable amount of fantasy’ about killing Mrs Maguire.

On Wednesday it was revealed that Cornick is on 24-hour suicide watch and has already been moved from a young offender institution after violent threats

On Monday he was sentenced to life in jail with a minimum of 20 years but a judge warned him he may never be released.

Mr Justice Coulson called the murder a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and found the teenager's pride and lack of remorse over his actions 'truly grotesque'.

He was initially taken to Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire before being moved for his own safety.

Cornick - one of 16 children serving indeterminate life sentences in Britain’s YOIs - had been held on the Anson wing in Wetherby, which is designed for long-term inmates, reported The Times.

The boy was seen to be at risk from other convicts and placed in solitary confinement in a cell with a glass door, according to a report submitted to Leeds Crown Court by his defence team.

He will now be held at Hindley Young Offenders' Institution until he is 18 when he will be moved to another unit.  

It costs the taxpayer £83,685 a year for each of the 441 prisoners to be held at the unit, reports the Sunday People.

Inmates can take part in classes such as English, maths and computer skills, as well as doing vocational ­courses such as cookery, woodwork and painting and decorating.

Sports on offer at the unit include football, badminton, indoor bowls, hockey, tennis, weight-training and rugby league.
