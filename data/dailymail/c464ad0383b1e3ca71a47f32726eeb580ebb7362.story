Police in New York are pioneering a futuristic new crime-fighting system that lets them see surveillance camera images from anywhere in the city and creates an interactive data map revealing arrest figures, license plates and radiation levels  - all at the click of a button.

The Microsoft software, called ‘the dashboard’, sends an alert to officers as soon as an emergency call is made and operates a giant video wall that allows cops to watch more than 3,000 cameras city-wide as crimes are unfolding.

It has been in use for a year but could now be rolled out to other forces in a move that could make tens of millions of dollars for New York Police Department, which gets a 30 per cent cut of any sales.

Crime-fighting software: Microsoft has helped develop the technology, which provides officers with huge amounts of information, including security footage from cameras across the city

The Domain Awareness System instantly shows officers an interactive map of the 
neighbourhood of where the initial call relates to, footage from nearby 
security cameras, whether there are high radiation levels and whether 
any other threats have been made against the city.

Officers in America's biggest police department have been using the system, which gives access to the department's voluminous arrest records, telephone calls, more than 3,000 security cameras citywide, license plate readers and radiation detectors, for about a year.

And the NYPD could make tens of millions of dollars under an unprecedented marketing deal that allows Microsoft to sell the system to other law enforcement agencies and civilian companies around the world. The city will get a 30 per cent cut.

It is currently used only in NYPD offices, mostly in the counterterrorism unit. Eventually, the system could supply crime-fighting information in real time to officers on laptops in their squad cars and on mobile devices while they walk the beat. 

Jessica Tisch, director of planning and policy for the counterterrorism unit, said: 'It works incredibly well.'

In August, officers used the system during a deadly shooting outside the Empire State Building.

Dozens of emergency telephone calls were coming in, and it initially looked like an attack staged by several gunmen. But officers mapped the information and pulled up cameras within 500 feet of the reported shots to determine there was only one shooter. 

At about 9am on Friday, August 24, disgruntled employee Jeffrey Johnson hid behind a car and then pulled out a .45-caliber pistol on his ex-boss Steven Ercolino and fired at his head.

After Ercolino fell to the ground, Johnson stood over him and shot four more times, a witness told investigators.

The incident sparked early-morning chaos and multiple other injuries near the Empire State Building.

Johnson was scuppered in his plans to escape after a construction worker saw the killing, chased him down the street and alerted police, who shot the gunman dead.

In the rush-hour ruckus, nine passersby were injured. Two people - the gunman and his former boss - were killed.

Analysts are cautious about the 
potential profits, saying that largely depends on Microsoft's sales 
efforts and whether any major competition arises. While there other 
data-drilling products made by other companies, they say the NYPD's 
involvement could set the dashboard apart.

'This is the kind of stuff you used to only see in movies,' analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group, a technology analysis firm, said.

'Getting it to work in a way that police departments can use in real time is huge.'

The venture began in 2009 when the NYPD approached Microsoft about building software to help mine data for the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative, a network of private and public cameras and other tools monitored by the department's counter-terrorism bureau.

Development cost the department between $30 million and $40 million, officials said.

'Usually, you purchase software that you try to work with, but we wanted this to be something that really worked well for us, so we set about creating it with them,' said Richard Daddario, the NYPD's deputy commissioner for counter-terrorism.

Officers were involved throughout the process with the programmers, offering advice on what they need during an emergency.

'It was created by cops for cops,' Tisch said. 'We thought a lot about what information we want up close and personal, and what needs to be a click away. It's all baked in there.'

Dave Mosher, a Microsoft vice 
president in charge of program management, said the company started to 
market the system in August and is looking at smaller municipalities, 
law enforcement agencies and companies that handle major sporting 
events.

No firm timetable has been set on when the dashboard will be rolled out to the entire 34,000-offficer department.
