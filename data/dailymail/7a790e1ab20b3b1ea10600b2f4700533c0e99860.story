A soldier has told a court how he pulled an unconscious woman from a freezing river after seeing her lover and his friend allegedly beat her before rolling her body into the water 'like a log'.

Army Captain Mark Gold, 43, was enjoying a Sunday stroll along the River Taff in Cardiff with his family when he saw Leanne Ware, 31, allegedly being drowned in the river.

Ms Ware's boyfriend Martin Edwards, 43, and his friend Gary Pincott, 55, both deny attempted murder.

Capt Gold told Cardiff Crown Court 
that he had sprung into action after seeing Edwards and Pincott beat 
Miss Ware, before rolling her body into the river.

The
 soldier from the Army Medical Corps then ran into the water to fight 
off the alleged attackers, and performed life-saving CPR on Miss Ware 
after hauling her from the river.

Giving
 evidence in the trial of Edwards and Pincott, Capt Gold said he had 
been walking along the river bank with his family when he saw two men 
attack Ms Ware.

'My wife and children looked over the railings of the bridge and started hysterically screaming,' he told the court yesterday.

'I looked over and saw two men viciously attacking a lady who was on the floor in the foetal position.

'She was unconscious, she wasn’t trying to defend herself from the kicks and punches, and she wasn't making any noise.'

The jury was told that Capt Gold then dragged his children away from the scene and rang 999 on his mobile phone.

He said he saw two men pushing Miss Ware into the river - Edwards rolling her with his feet and Pincott pushing with his hands.

'She rolled into the river like a log,' he said.

'She didn’t even try to fight - she just disappeared under the water.'

The
 father-of-three, who has served as an Army medic for 21 years then ran 
down to the river bank to try and save Miss Ware from drowning.

'A man I now know is Pincott ran past me away from the river,' he told the court.

'He wasn’t screaming for help - he was trying to get away.'

Capt Gold said Miss Ware suddenly 'bobbed' to surface of the freezing river last February but was face down and wasn’t moving.

He watched as Edwards swam toward her seemingly lifeless body.

'I thought he was going to rescue her but he didn’t,' he said. 'He pushed her beneath the water and she disappeared again.

'Not once did he try to bring her head out of the water.'

When Miss Ware returned to the surface and became caught on the riverbank, Capt Gold said he fought off her attacker and pulled her to the bank.

'She was blue, not moving and had no pulse. She was dead,' he said.

'She had been under the water for close to three minutes and there were no signs of life.'

He said he then began to perform CPR and with the help of a passing doctor who performed mouth-to-mouth they managed to revive her.

When paramedics arrived, Miss Ware rushed to hospital and fortunately went on to make a full recovery.

Captain Gold identified Edwards and Pincott to police officers at the scene and they were arrested following the incident in February.

Earlier in the trial the court heard that Edwards had told police that Miss Ware had ended up in the water after the couple had argued, and that he had gone in to help her. Pincott said he had witnessed the argument and denied assaulting Miss Ware in any way.

Edwards, of Butetown, Cardiff, denies attempting to murder Miss Ware and a charge of assaulting Mark Gold.

Pincott, of Barry, near Cardiff, also denies attempted murder.

The trial continues.
