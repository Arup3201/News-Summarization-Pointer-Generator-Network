A car rests bolt upright against a telegraph wire after it careered off a country road in a bizarre crash.

The Vauxhall Corsa veered off the narrow B1084 in Chillesford, Suffolk, and came to rest practically on its haunches.

Incredibly, the driver and four passengers walk away unhurt following the smash, which happened just after noon yesterday.

Bizarre: The crash happened just after noon and caused a power cut

Baffled police are still trying to work out how the bizarre accident happened.

A Suffolk Police spokesman said: 'There were four passengers in the vehicle and there were no injuries reported but the vehicle was held up by a telegraph pole.

'It seems there was no real damage to the vehicle or the telegraph pole.

'The power to the pole was turned off temporarily while the car was recovered.'
