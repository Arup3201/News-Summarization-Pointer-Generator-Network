The Duke of Cambridge’s mug at his Royal Air Force base was labelled ‘Big Willy’, it emerged today.

An uncropped version of a photo of Prince William, 30 - part of a set issued by St James’s Palace on the Duke’s website - reveals his nickname on the mug at RAF Valley on Anglesey, north Wales.

The photo was first issued last November with the mug title cropped out - and that release followed a Ministry of Defence security blunder that saw sensitive information visible in some earlier photos.

The new version of the photo of Flight Lieutenant Wales is visible on the Duke’s website - along with the mug title. The Daily Star Sunday claimed that the nickname was first given to him by Kate.

His wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, was nicknamed ‘Waity Katie’ because they were together for a decade before marrying - and she had to sit out the years before William proposed.

The caption on the cropped photo issued by the Press Association last November said: ‘The Duke of Cambridge making a cup of tea whilst working as a helicopter search and rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey, Wales.’

It added that the undated picture was part of a ‘day in the life’ set of photos featuring William in his work flying RAF Sea King helicopters from RAF Valley as a Search and Rescue pilot.

The MoD was forced to reset the user names and computer passwords of dozens of RAF staff following an embarrassing security blunder over the William pictures last November.

Ten photographs of the future king in his role as a search and rescue helicopter pilot were published by St James’s Palace on the Duke’s website before being cleared by the MoD.

But the publicity exercise backfired within hours as it emerged that sensitive information was visible in four photos. In one, William was in front of a computer with a password prompt screen open.

Another showed a document on the desk and an email open on a computer. Other photographs showed details of passwords and user names pinned up on a wall.

By the time horrified defence officials spotted the mistake – some four hours after publication online – the shots had appeared on websites around the world, on TV and in newspapers.

They were ‘rereleased’ with the details pixelated, but the MoD had no choice but to reset passwords of some personnel ‘as a precaution’.
