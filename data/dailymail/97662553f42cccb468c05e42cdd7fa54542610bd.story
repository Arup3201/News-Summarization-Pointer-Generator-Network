An advert that uses the 'Harlem Shake' internet craze to raise awareness of Parkinson's disease has sparked controversy because it features a sufferer staggering about as the music plays.

The Dutch Parkinson's Society released the video, called 'Worst Shake Ever', that shows society chairman Eric Roos, who did not take his medication in order to make the video, shaking out of control in an office kitchen while the song Harlem Shake by Baauer plays.

The video imitates the Harlem Shake internet meme, which are short videos typically beginning with one person gently bopping alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else in the room ignores them. Then the bass line drops and everyone goes wild, doing crazy dance moves around the room.

The Dutch Parkinson's Society have released a spoof Harlem Shake Video to raise awareness of the debilitating effects of the disease. Society chairman Eric Roos (right) starts shaking as the music plays

In this version, when the bass drops, Mr Roos collapses and people in the office rush to help him.

The clip, created by advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi, ends with slogan: 'Shaking, fun for some â€¦ daily struggle for others.'

A statement on the charity's website said: 'With this the society and its chairman want to show that Parkinson's is much more than a shaking hand or foot.

'The intention of the video is that it shocks the viewer, because a lot of people don't know what the daily reality of Parkinson's is.'

Online observers were mixed about the
video. Some felt it was in poor taste, but many others felt it was a 
bold and effective way of spreading awareness of the condition.

Gawker user MichRo99, posted: 'This is horrible', while Kathy's Crown said: 'So, I have PD (Parkinson's disease) and my father died from same a year ago last Saturday. I can't even...'

Some say the publicity stunt is tasteless, but others defended it as a clever and memorable way of showing what the disease does to people

Collapse: The video ends with Mr Roos falling to the floor, before his colleagues come rushing to his aid

Message: The society says it wants to challenge the misconception that Parkinson's is simply a shaking hand or foot

However, Miss Norma Desmond said: 'I don't understand how people feel that this is making fun of people with PD (Parkinson's disease) when people with PD obviously participated in making it. Are they not allowed to do anything except be tragic all the time?'

Another, called Cerne, said: 'Wait. When did it become offensive for a disease advocacy group to demonstrate the effects of that disease?'

The video has since been removed because of copyright issues with the music company that owns the rights to the song used.

The Harlem Shake was created by a group of teenage boys on the Sunshine Coast of Australia.

Parkinson's Disease is a chronic neurological disorder.

People with the condition don't have enough of a chemical called dopamine because some nerve cells in their brain have died. This affects the way the brain co-ordinates the movements of the muscles in different parts of the body.

The
disease mainly develops in the over 50s. About 5 in 1,000 people in 
their 60s, and about 40 in 1,000 people in their 80s have the condition.
The main symptoms are slowness of movement, stiffness of muscles and 
shaking. These tend to slowly worsen with time although the rate varies 
from patient to patient.

The condition is diagnosed from the symptoms shown by the patient.
It also increases your risk of dementia. About half of people with PD 
develop dementia at some stage. Depression is also common among 
sufferers.

There
is currently no cure. Drugs and physiotherapy can treat symptoms. There
have also been recent promising trials using deep brain stimulation.
