The mother of missing toddler Ayla Reynolds is set to reveal harrowing crime scene photos of her daughter's blood taken at her ex-boyfriend's home following the little girl's disappearance.

Trista Reynolds, who also has two sons, has stayed quiet since the two-year-old's disappearance in December 2011 while staying at the home of her father Justin Di Pietro in Waterville, Maine.

Miss Reynolds is set to reveal new 
evidence next week in the hope of finally getting justice for her child who she 
believes suffered greatly.

Fighting for the truth: Trista Reynolds cradles her one-month-old son Anthony as she discusses the disappearance of her daughter Ayla two years ago

Miss Reynolds gave birth to a son Anthony last month and also has a two-year-old son Raymond.

By revealing the evidence, she intends to put pressure on the three people who were at the home when Ayla disappeared on December 17 - her ex-boyfriend, his sister Elisha and girlfriend Courtney Roberts.

Miss Reynolds was attending a ten-day rehab program at the time her daughter disappeared.

She told BangorDailyNews.com: 'Justin, Elisha and Courtney are still 
walking the streets like nothing has happened.

'After 
seeing [the evidence], it has started to settle in my mind that Ayla 
more than likely really is deceased and not coming back. I’m not just 
able to close my eyes and not see her blood.'

Desperate: Trista Reynolds is coming forward with evidence against her ex that she hopes will reignite the search for her daughter Ayla who went missing in December 2011

Miss Reynolds also claims that police have failed to keep her up-to-date on developments in her daughter's case.

She
said that she doesn't know if releasing new information will be 
detrimental to the case, she told BDN, but she wants to move things 
forward.

Maine investigators have said that they have 'no reaction' to Miss Reynold's decision to release evidence.

The news of the bloodstains last weekend came several days after DiPietro's arrest for violating the conditions of his bail for a
different charge. 

Father: Justin DiPietro, left, told cops he last saw Ayla, right, when
he put her to bed. He said she was wearing green 
pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them

Father and daughter: Ayla's blood was found in the partially finished basement that DiPietro used as his bedroom

DiPietro was charged with the domestic
violence assault of his ex-girlfriend Courtney Roberts in July and one 
of his bail conditions was that he not use or possess alcohol.

Earlier this month he was stopped by traffic police due to his car's expired 
inspection sticker. The officer discovered alcohol in the car and he was
brought in. 

'Theres been nothing in two years and I think it might help just close it,' Miss Reynolds said to local station WCSH last week of her decision to make the evidence public.

'If Ayla was their daughter or their child or their family member, I honestly believe that the case would be solved.'

She says that police showed her pictures of her daughter's blood that was found in DiPietro's basement, room, and truck.

A sample of the blood showed that the toddler's saliva was mixed with it, leading Ms Reynolds to believe that she suffered.

Mystery: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, 
was reported missing in December 2011 by her father 
Justin DiPietro, who told police he last saw her when he put her to bed 
the previous night

Police have not arrested DiPietro 
because there is no evidence to prove that he was the one who killed his
daughter but they have said that they do not think it is reasonable to
believe that she is still alive.

'With
what was shown to me I don't see how any little child can survive after
that. All I can picture when I close my eyes is the blood that I saw,' 
Ms Reynolds said.

'No mom should have to ever experience what I did that day, ever.'
