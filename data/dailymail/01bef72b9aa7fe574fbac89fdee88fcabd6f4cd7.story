When a woman purchased a record at her local thrift store in Colorado she never imagined she'd find a letter written from a soldier in 1944 during World War II to his love back at home to whom he was later married for 63 years.

Ilene Ortiz of Westminster bought the old record, though she can't remember which one, six months ago and when she found the letter tucked inside she felt determined to find its rightful owner.

'We brought the album home and we were looking through it, and I said, 'There's a letter in here!'' Ortiz told ABC.

Young Loves: Bill and Bernadean Moore were married for 63 years and when Bill fought in World War II he sent florid love notes to Bernadean who was a high-school student in Kansas

Beautiful words: 'I have never been so homesick for anyone in all my life as I am for you,' concludes the letter

Overcome with emotion: Ilene Ortiz returned the letter to the Gales' daughter Melinda Gale who was amazed by her father's loving words to her mother 

'I thought, "This is such a romantic letter and someone should have it."'

Ortiz contacted ABC affiliate KMGH for help in finding the relatives of the subjects of the letter and together they located the deceased mother Bernadean and elderly father Bill's  daughter Melinda Gale, 48.

Bill and Bernadean were married and moved to Colorado with their three children not far from where the letter was found. 

'My darling, lovable, alluring, Bernadean,' said the letter, written on December 29, 1944.

Gale's parents met when Bill was on furlough and her mother was still in high school in Fredonia, Kansas where the letter was sent.

'I ran out of space, but I could have written a lot more adjectives describing you. You are so lovely, darling, that I often wonder how it is possible that you are mine. I'm really the luckiest guy in the world, you know. And you are the reason, Bernadean. Even your name sounds lovely to me,'said the letter written when Bill was just 20-years-old.

Melinda Gale held back tears as she read the touching letter from her father to her mother 70 years ago. 

Gale's mother died in 2010 but her memory still lives on with the help of letters like this one. 

She told ABC she never could have imagined her father, a mechanical engineer, would use the flowery and loving language that he did. 

Gale's parents met when Bill was on furlough and her mother Bernadean (pictured) was still in high school in Fredonia, Kansas where the letter was sent.

Tracked down relatives: Ilene Ortiz says when she found the lovely letter in a vintage record that she knew she had to track down the rightful owners 

Beautiful words: 'I have never been so homesick for anyone in my life as I am for you,' reads the letter 

'It's just when I get so horribly, terribly lonely for you that I write letters like this,' the letter continues.

'I have never been so homesick for anyone in my life as I am for you.'

'My hands were shaking when I finished reading it,' Gale said emotionally.

'It’s truly was a window into how deep their love was. And obviously, they were married for almost 63 years. We knew they loved each other very, very much, but as children you don’t see that. Where it came from, that deep connection, and this was a window into their story. He was a mechanical engineer. I cannot believe he shared these deep emotional words with her,' she shared.

Gale and her history teacher sister always had a fascination with their father's experience in the war and in 2000 took a trip to Europe to retrace his steps.

Fought in the war: Melinda Gale said that most of her parents time dating was spent writing letters back and froth to each other when her father was fighting in World War II 

True loves: Bill and and Bernadean Moore were married for 63 years up until the time Bernadean died in 2010

'Mom had never gotten to see everywhere he had been. We did this amazing trip so I can picture exactly where he was on December 29 of 1944, sitting in this miserable, cold, dark forest in the northern region where France, Germany and Belgium all meet.'

Gale told ABC she thinks her mother may have slipped the letter into the record for safe keeping because it was special to her.

Even though Ortiz says she can't remember which record she found the letter in, Gale has her own theory.

Gale explained that her mother and father's special song was 'I'll be seeing you,' from the Broadway musical Right This Way.

Mom’s song for dad was ‘I’ll Be Seeing You,' she said. 

'I’m sure it was in there.'

'What a sweet, wonderful Valentines gift to give our family,' Gale said.

'I didn’t get to meet this wonderful lady who found the letter, but I just can’t thank her enough.'

Gales plans to give the letter to her father who lives in a veteran's assisted care facility.
