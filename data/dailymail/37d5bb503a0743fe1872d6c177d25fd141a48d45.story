A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the death of a 96-year-old woman at a care home. 

Ethel Baldwin died at Abbey House Care Home in Southampton, Hampshire on September 13 after staff called police on August 29 following a suspected assault.

The woman, described as a 'much loved' resident by a spokesman for the home, had been receiving palliative care there for two years at the time of her death. 

A Hampshire Police spokesman said: 'Specialist officers have been liaising with the care home and family members to establish the circumstances of this death and to ensure the safeguarding of other residents at the care home,' a spokesman said. 

'A 36-year-old woman from Southampton has today been arrested on suspicion of murder and is helping police with their enquiries.'  

Police are yet to confirm or deny whether the woman arrested today is a member of staff at the home.

The 48-bedroomed care home is thought to be open as normal while police quiz the woman arrested today

The home, where it is thought Ms Baldwin was a resident, is adjacent to the historic Netley Abbey in Southampton, Hampshire

A statement released by the care home today said: 'In line with its long-established ‘no tolerance’ policy towards abuse, Abbey House Nursing Home notified both the safeguarding authority and the police as soon as managers and care staff became aware on 29th August that one of its residents may have been assaulted.'

'We have since been cooperating fully with the police in their investigation into the incident. Sadly, Ethel passed away on 13th September. We extend our sincere condolences to her family.

'It is our understanding that all the parties involved consider this to have been an isolated incident that does not reflect an underlying problem at the nursing home.'

'Clearly, our priority now must be to provide reassurance to our other residents and their families.'
