Mauricio Pochettino has called on Tottenham fans to stop booing Emmanuel Adebayor.

The forward was barracked on being substituted in the Capital One Cup semi-final victory over Sheffield United in midweek.

Adebayor had previously incurred the wrath of the White Hart Lane faithful for claiming earlier in the season that the players preferred away games because of a perceived lack of support at home and will be included in the squad for Saturday's FA Cup fourth round tie at home to Leicester City. 

Emmanuel Adebayor returned to Tottenham last weekend, but was booed by some Spurs fans

Adebayor received a tough reaction from the White Hart Lane crowd when he left the pitch in the FA Cup

Asked whether he feared the poisonous atmosphere could drive Adebayor away from the club, head coach Pochettino admitted that was the case.

'Yes, but we need to change that,' he said. 'We need to give our supporters good performances and good victories to create a better atmosphere. This is our way.

'We have the opportunity to offer our supporters another victory and change their feelings about us.' Tottenham have a reputation for being a successful cup side, and Pochettino is also planning ahead for the resumption of the Europa League next month.

And he revealed that fellow Argentinian Osvaldo Ardiles, a FA Cup winner with Tottenham in 1981 and 1982 and now an ambassador for the club, had given him a helpful history lesson.

'He explained to me how important it is for the supporters and the club to get to finals,' he said. 

'That is what we are fighting for - to get the victory against Sheffield United on Wednesday and to get past Leicester.' 

So is Pochettino prepared to emulate Ardiles, who sang in wobbly English in the song for the 1981 final 'Ossie's Dream', which included the lines 'Ossie's going to Wembley, his knees have gone all trembly'? 'I am not a very good singer,' he said. 'But my knees are strong.'

Pochettio says the fans need to be behind the team in order for them to be successful
