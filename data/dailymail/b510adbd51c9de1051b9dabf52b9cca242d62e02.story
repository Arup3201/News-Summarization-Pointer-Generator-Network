A Brazilian news anchor found himself in the middle of a nerve wracking hostage situation after the suspect asked to speak to him while holding his family hostage with a knife.

Jose Luiz Datena, the host of police and crime show Urgent Brazil, successfully negotiated with the man live on air and the suspect released his mother and sister whom he was threatening to kill with a knife.

Police had surrounded a house in the greater Sao Paulo metropolitan area and had been negotiating with the suspect for about an hour but to no avail.

Beyond the call of duty: Jose Luiz Datena, the host of police and crime show Urgent Brazil, negotiated live on air for 20 minutes with a man who was holding his sister and mother hostage with a knife

It was when the man asked to speak with Mr Datena that police agreed to his demands and a solution was found.

Mr Datena - live on air - pleaded with the man to release his sister and mother unharmed and finally he succeeded.

Surrounded in Sao Paulo: Police had been negotiating with the man for about an hour with no success when the suspect demanded he speak to Mr Datena

Family freed: After 20 minutes, Mr Datena's negotiations with the suspect were successful - he released his mother and sister unharmed

He later told a Brazilian online news source that he had regretted being a part in the nerve wracking situation. 

He was quoted by CNN as saying: ‘I deeply regretted doing that.

‘It is not our role as journalists.’

Finally caught: The man was led out of the house. It was reported that he was distraught because he was having martial problems

Brazilian news cameras captured the moment the two women walked free, relieved, from their house, followed by the suspect accompanied by police.

It was reported that the man was apparently having problems in his marriage and was distraught at the time.

Mr Datena, who was voted one of the '100 greatest Brazilians of all time' this year, has reportedly received threats in the past including kidnap and murder plots.

He started his career in radio before becoming a television presenter on a sports show.

Regretted it: Mr Datena said after the incident that negotiating was not the role of a journalist

Police plead: Officers stand outside the house where the suspect held his family, threatening to kill them with a knife
