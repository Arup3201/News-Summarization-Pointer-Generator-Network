Keen fundraiser Harriotte was forced to give up ballet dancing and was left feeling too embarrassed and ashamed to continue modelling after the freak accident.

But her mother Sarah, 41, was determined to help her teenage daughter regain her confidence and secretly entered the young beauty into the Miss Teen UK competition.

Harriotte said: 'After the skin graft I felt too ashamed to model again, and I  was embarrassed to show my legs.

'I stayed in hospital for a few days, and couldn’t really do anything for quite a while. It was about three months before I was back on my feet.

'And I can’t dance at all anymore, there was too much damage to my right leg and muscle.'

Harriotte, from Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear, was hospitalised after the fat burn ‘ate through her leg to the muscle’ leaving her in need of a skin graft, taken from her hip.

Sarah rushed her to their local walk-in centre, but the severe burn was misdiagnosed as a scald and drastically deteriorated, leaving Harriotte in need of emergency care.

The youngster - who started modelling at the age of three - is now modelling again and is looking forward to taking part in her first pageant competition at the end of August.

She said:'I have had a lot of support, and my mum has really helped me.

'I had no idea she had entered me into the pageant. I never would have done it myself.

'And when the letter arrived to say I was Miss Teen Newcastle, I was so confused.

'But I am so happy she did it for me. I am really excited about taking part in my first official pageant. I can’t wait.'

Proud mother Sarah, a marketing director said: 'When Harriotte burned her leg it really affected her, she just wanted to hide away.

Harriotte says she never would have entered the pageant herself but it has made her more confident

'She was absolutely in bits, thinking she had done one stupid thing that might have ruined her future.

'It was horrific, the walk in centre said it was a scald and sent her home but her leg got stuck to the bedding and pulled off her skin.

'Up until the accident she had always modelled so I entered her into the Miss Teen GB competition.

'The burn has healed amazingly, and I am so proud of her.'
