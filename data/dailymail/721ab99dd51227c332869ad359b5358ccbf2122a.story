A lorry driver has admitted causing a £250,000 train crash - with hundreds of bales of hay.

Oswald Davies, 49, risked the lives of passengers after driving his truck pulling two giant hay trailers onto a busy train line as it travelled from West Wales to Manchester.

Seven passengers were injured in the smash as bales of hay were scattered across the track after the train hit the lorry.

Absolute Hay-hem: Seven passengers were injured in the smash as bales of hay were scattered across the track after the train hit the lorry in Whitland, Carmarthenshire, in December last year

He was crossing the rail-line in his lorry pulling the two trailer when the safety barrier came down on the other side.

The engine driver travelling from Milford Haven in West Wales to Manchester could not stop in time after spotting the lorry across the lines.

Collision: Up to 60 people were on the crowded commuter service between Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, and Manchester

The train was travelling at 60mph at Whitland, Carmarthenshire, on December 19 last year.

Davies pleaded guilty at Swansea Crown Court to endangering the lives of passengers.

The
court heard the cost of the incident so far has been estimated at 
£250,000 - with damage to the train and the cost of diverting other 
services.

The court was told some of those injured still had 'ongoing difficulties.'

Team effort: Emergency services had to clamber over the hay bales in order to get to the train and passengers inside

Emergency: Fire and ambulance crews tend to passengers, many of whom were suffering from shock

Hurt: Seven passengers were injured on the train which was carrying families and elderly travellers

Helping hand: A rescuer takes injured passengers' luggage to safety

Miles Bennett, defending, said he believed maintenance workers from Network Rail had lowered the safety barrier as a prank.

He said: 'The barrier came down dramatically quickly and not only did he think his own life was in danger he thought the Network Rail people were mucking about.

'He got out of one side of his cab to remonstrate with them. Had he got out the other side he would not be here today.'

He accepted that he did not notice a sign telling drivers of certain classes of vehicle to telephone the crossing signaler for the go ahead to cross.

He said a railway accident report mentioned that his view of the track was obstructed by
Network Rail vehicles parked alongside the crossing, and the lights on 
the railway crossing were not properly aligned.

Davies,
of Castell Pigyn, Llanboidy, was accused of endangering the lives of 
people using the railway after his Scania lorry towing two hay trailers 
came into contact with a train at the Henllan Amgoed Crossing, Whitland.

Davies released on bail to be sentenced later this month.
