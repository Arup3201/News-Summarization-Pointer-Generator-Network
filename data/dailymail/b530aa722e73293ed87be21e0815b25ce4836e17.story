In his former life, he was accustomed to fighting court battles on behalf of other people.

But barrister-turned-porn baron Paul Baxendale-Walker has now found himself at the centre of his  own legal row –  with one of his harem of ‘hunny bunnies’.

The millionaire adult entertainment boss has boasted of having more than a dozen girls at his beck and call, offering them a luxury lifestyle and lavish gifts in return for satisfying his sexual needs.

When he decided to drop one of these 
women, however, she began making her own demands – insisting he let her 
keep the £300,000 Home Counties flat and Range Rover he had funded.

Former
glamour model Natasha Anastasia Eustace claimed that far from being one
of many dalliances for the porn tycoon – who sometimes stars in his 
adult films – they had a ‘loving relationship’ and had discussed 
marriage.

MR Baxendale-Walker has starred in porn films made by his own company, the court heard

Yesterday 
Oxford-educated Mr Baxendale-Walker lost the first round of a  High 
Court battle with his ex-lover as a judge dismissed his attempts to 
throw out the case.

Mr 
Justice Males ruled that 25-year-old Miss Eustace may have been more 
than ‘just another stripper who would have sex with him in exchange for 
temporary material benefits’ and ordered a full trial to decide the 
issue.

He said that after graduating Mr  Baxendale-Walker, 49, worked as a barrister and later as a solicitor specialising in tax law.

‘Some
people might have found that exciting enough but … he [later] acquired 
and ran a  company making pornographic films in which he also starred,’ 
the judge said.

‘He describes himself now  as a wealthy man living a  playboy lifestyle.

‘His
lifestyle involves essentially casual relationships with multiple 
sexual partners, a group or club of women known as his “hunny bunnies” 
to whom, in return for their sexual favours, he makes lavish gifts, 
including money, clothes and holidays, as well as providing flats and 
cars for their use.’

According
to Mr Baxendale-Walker, Miss Eustace was a member of this club and 
their relationship was casual and ‘non-exclusive’ on both sides before 
it ended in October 2012.

Mr
Baxendale-Walker, who bought lads’ magazine Loaded in May 2012, had 
told the court that Miss Eustace ‘was never anything more than a TV 
stripper and glamour model, who provided sex and occasional 
companionship in exchange for a comfortable and conditional standard of 
living’.

‘She is only one of more than a dozen girls for whom I procure the provision [of] housing, cars and other benefits,’ he said.

‘The provision is always conditional on my satisfaction with the relationship.

‘As soon as I am no longer satisfied, the benefits are withdrawn’.

But Miss Eustace claimed the pair had a ‘loving and close relationship’ which lasted until the beginning of this year.

Despite
arguments over Mr Baxendale-Walker’s dalliances with other women, she 
said she understood their relationship to be intended as a long-term and
faithful one, and insisted the couple had discussed marriage more than 
once.

After their break-up she demanded she was allowed to keep her 
vehicle and flat in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey.

The
judge quoted a number of ‘rambling and emotional’ emails from the porn 
baron which he said did indicate there was more to the relationship than
Mr Baxendale-Walker’s ungallant descriptions suggested.

Last
June, Mr Baxendale-Walker wrote to his lover: ‘It is the Natasha colour
of my soul. I guess it must always have been there, but it took you 
coming into my life to awaken it.

‘Since then, my life has not  been the same. It can never be the same.

‘The specialness of who you are has opened my heart as I never knew it could be. That is an amazing, beautiful thing…’

The
judge said the messages had a ‘genuine ring’ and that there was likely 
to be ‘fertile ground for cross-examination on both sides’ during the 
trial.

He added: ‘The case may  well look rather different at the end of a trial.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
