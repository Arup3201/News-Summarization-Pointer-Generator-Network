She can more than afford a grand entrance and could have had her own chauffeur-driven car if she chose.

But the new Dutch Queen decided to keep her visit to a park opening low key - by arriving on a bicycle.

And Maxima Zorreguieta, who became Queen of the Netherlands when her mother-in-law Beatrix abdicated the throne to her son in April, didn't let her basic form of transport get in the way of style.

Leading the way: Queen Maxima, pictured, stunned locals as she cycled through the neighbourhood of Leidsche Rijn to get the unveiling of the new park name

The 40-year-old, whose looks have previously been compared to Britney Spears, wore a brightly-coloured but elegant dress matched with a pair of beige strappy sandals.

She happily cycled through the Leidsche Rijn neighbourhood in Utrecht, The Netherlands, to the opening of a park being named in her honour.

Her relaxed approach to official events may be down to the fact that Maxima was not born Royalty - but has become Queen through her marriage to King William IV.

Maxima was born a commoner in Argentina and is the daughter of a minister who served in the military junta in the late 1970s.

The royal couple have three daughters, Amalia, nine, Alexia, seven, and Ariane, five.

Her 45-year-old husband became King in April after his mother Beatrix abdicated the throne shortly after a 75th birthday.

Queen Beatrix said she was stepping down because she believed ‘the responsibility should now lie in the hands of a new generation’.

King William is the first male to accede to the Dutch throne since 1890. His mother has ruled the Netherlands since April 30, 1980.

In her televised address making the 
announcement in January, Queen Beatrix said she had been thinking about 
abdicating for several years but now was the ‘moment to lay down my 
crown’.

She said: ‘I do
 not step down because the office is too heavy, but with the conviction 
that the responsibility should now lie in the hands of a new generation.
 I am grateful for the many years that I have been allowed to be your 
queen.’

She added that 
Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, her oldest son, would ‘serve our country 
with dedication, faithful to the constitution’.
