Newcastle defender Paul Dummett believes a homegrown spine of English players is the reason behind the club's astonishing revival in the last two months.

At the end of September, a 1-0 defeat at Stoke meant discontent from Newcastle supporters at their woeful start to the season was turning venomous towards manager Alan Pardew.

But since that game they have only lost once more on a run of form that has seen them rise to seventh in the Premier League, handing Chelsea their first defeat of the season along the way.

And Dummett believes the Geordie core of Pardew's side has been a huge influence.

'We are used to being fans of Newcastle. We know what it feels like to be on the terraces. We know what it takes to please the fans. We have to do well and represent our area,' Dummett said in an interview with the Daily Mirror. 

'I think it does matter having Geordies in there. It helps ground the club and have a link the area.'

Dummett believes the result at St James' Park last weekend against Chelsea demonstrates the impact  homegrown players can have upon the team.

'I have been thinking about it this week. We had Jack Colback, who played for Sunderland but is from Killingworth.

'Steven Taylor (until he was sent off after 83 minutes) from Whitley Bay, Sammy Ameobi on the left wing from Fenham and Jak Alnwick in for his debut in goal.'

Newcastle travel to London to take on Arsenal in the late kick-off on Saturday, knowing victory would see them overtake Arsene Wenger's  side and move to sixth in the table.
