David Beckham is hoping to convince David Moyes to become the manager of his new Miami MLS franchise.

The former Manchester United manager is held in high esteem by Beckham and, according to The Sunday Times, will try to persuade the 51-year-old to join him in the US.

Moyes has been in Florida recently, where he owns a home, and was also in attendance on Wednesday to watch England draw with Ecuador.

And he is planning a world tour of football to refresh himself if the right job doesn’t come up in the next few months.

He is enthusiastic about the prospect
 of managing abroad if a good opportunity arises – but if not, will 
use the time to broaden his horizons and travel to prepare himself for 
his next job.

‘I’m 
getting ready to work again,’ said Moyes. ‘I don’t know how I’ll be in a
 few weeks time when pre season starts. It’ll be the first time since I 
was 16 that I’m not starting a pre-season. But if a job doesn’t crop up 
which suits me, I’ll travel.

‘So
 many players come out of South America, I’d like to go and watch what 
they do. There’s more players from Brazil playing overseas than any 
other country and more in the Champions League than any nationality.

'So,
 there is a continual conveyer belt of them. Is it their development? Is
 the raw talent just better? And at the top level, any team you work for
 is going to have plenty of South Americans, so it would be good to 
understand the culture they’re from.'

Beckham, however, remains optimistic that he will be able to convince Moyes to relocate himself a bit further North instead.
