The former partner of a benefits fraudster, who swindled as much as £100,000 from taxpayers to enjoy a lavish lifestyle, claims the ex-Moulin Rouge showgirl was also a love cheat who drained his finances.

Company director Marc Lissimore, 46, today spoke of his relationship with mother-of-two Dawn Orton, who used taxpayers' cash to buy a convertible Mercedes and go on 41 holidays in 13 years.

Orton was jailed for 12 months for wrongly claiming widowed mothers' allowance, plus an additional month after she initially refused to turn up for her trial at Hull Crown Court earlier this month.

Dawn Orton, once a Moulin Rouge dancer who travelled the world, was found guilty of benefit fraud

The 47-year-old had in fact fled Britain to Malaga. An international arrest warrant was issued and Orton handed herself in to police last Friday.

In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Mr Lissimore reveals the full extent of her deception, which left him cash poor and fighting for her affection after discovering Orton had an American lover.

He said: 'She was a devil in disguise. She was beautiful and I was an overweight businessman who thought he was lucky to have her, and she made sure I knew that.'

The heartbroken businessman met Orton, who once performed as a dancer all over Europe and Japan, through his ex-wife Betsy.

When Mr Lissimore's marriage ended, he was contacted by Orton, who told him that her husband Robert had committed suicide. He travelled from Hull to Tamworth, Staffordshire, to attend the funeral in October 1996 and offered support to the newly-widowed Orton.

A relationship quickly developed: by Christmas she had moved into his home with her sons Reece, 19 and CJ, 23, and by New Year's Day 1997 the pair were engaged.

Mr Lissimore, who owned and ran haulage firms in Hull said the couple enjoyed a wealthy lifestyle and he often lavished her with extravagant gifts and foreign trips.

They also bought a £280,000 house in the leafy village of Cottingham, as well as a craft shop which Orton ran.

But he was unaware that throughout the 13 years they were together, Orton had continued to claim an allowance for widowed mothers. This should have stopped when she moved in with Mr Lissimore.

She had also previously received incapacity benefits for an injured shoulder. Prosecutors believe Orton's deception amounts to at least £29,000 - and as much as £100,000.

The situation began to unravel following the death of Orton's mother in May 2010 from breast cancer.

The otherwise devoted wife told Mr Lissimore that she needed to get away for a few weeks and that she would travel to America and stay with an old friend from school called Roger Bailey.

But the father-of-two was suspicious and decided to check his wife's emails, discovering that the two were in fact lovers.

'I couldn't resist opening a couple of their email exchanges and I felt sick when I read one from Dawn, saying, "How am I going to introduce you to my children?" When I confronted her she denied it all. She said she loved me and when she returned we would get married...something she'd been putting off for 13 years.'

Mr Lissimore believed Orton and even took her to Manchester airport for her flight in June 2010. But she then refused to return and asked for her son, Reece, to join her.

When she finally returned home, Orton claimed she had made a mistake and begged for the company director to take her back.

It was a pattern that would repeat itself many times over, as she continued to pay her long-term partner against her American lover. The deceived businessman also said Orton often used sex as a 'weapon' to get her own way.

Mr Lissimore then claims Orton, who had fears about becoming pregnant, promised she would leave her lover if he had a vasectomy. In desperation, he agreed to the procedure, but it was not long before Orton left him for good and returned to yacht salesman Bailey.

He said: 'I was devastated. I'd done everything, everything I could, to keep this woman, but she was cold and callous. What she did to me was terrible, but what she did to her two sons was even worse. They are both disgusted and neither of them talk to Dawn any more.'

Within weeks of leaving him, Mr Lissimore discovered she was being investigated for benefit fraud.

And worse was to come - when he tried to recoup some of the money from his house and shop, he was told he had no rights because both were in Orton's name.

Mr Lissimore had agreed to do this, because of debt issues - and he said he had no reason to distrust his partner at that time.

Following Orton's conviction last week, Mr Lissimore said: 'Dawn expects the world to run around her. She will not believe she has done anything wrong.

He added: 'Her whole life has been about greed. Taking as much cash as she can from anyone.'

Orton now faces an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act to claim back her ill-gotten gains and will appear for a hearing at Hull Crown Court on April 4.
