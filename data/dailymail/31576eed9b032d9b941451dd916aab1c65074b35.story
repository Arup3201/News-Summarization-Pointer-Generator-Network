Questions: Gerry Adams interview tapes are being sought by prosecutors

Prosecutors in the U.S. are demanding that a university hands over to Britain taped interviews in which former IRA members purportedly accuse Gerry Adams of running a secret death squad.

Researchers on an oral history project for Boston College obtained the testimonies from two convicted IRA terrorists between 2001 and 2006.

Adams, president of Sinn Fein, has always denied being an IRA member, let alone heading a unit which – in kidnapping, torturing and killing suspected informants – carried out some of its most brutal acts.

The interviews being sought by Northern Ireland police are with Brendan Hughes, who was head of the IRA in Belfast, and Dolours Price, who took part in the 1973 Old Bailey car bombing and the unsolved killings of at least four people.

Both later fell out with Adams and Sinn Fein, criticising the Northern Ireland peace process.

The college says the pair only agreed to talk on condition their taped confessions remained sealed and their identities protected until after their deaths. Hughes died in 2008, but Price is still alive.

Lawyers for the college claim releasing the details ‘prematurely’ would not only damage the peace process but break the IRA’s ‘code of silence’  and could lead to ‘punishment by death’.

But Northern Ireland police want the tapes now, convinced they hold crucial clues to at least nine unsolved murders as well as kidnappings in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.

Bombings: Dolours Price was in one of the interviews with Adams

Federal prosecutors have now asked a judge to order the university to comply under U.S. treaty obligations with the UK.

Some of the testimony from Hughes has already been used in a book and TV programme.

In his interview, he spoke about serving alongside Adams and claimed the Sinn Fein leader was involved in the 1972 murder of Jean McConville, a mother of ten from Belfast.

Adams has denied being involved in the killing, claiming Hughes was ‘not well’ at the time he gave the interview.

Real IRA godfather Michael McKevitt yesterday lost his appeal against a landmark civil action that branded him the mastermind behind the Omagh bombing atrocity. He had tried to overturn an historic court victory won by relatives of some of the 29 people murdered in the 1998 attack. But a judge at Belfast Crown Court dismissed his appeal, and that of his right-hand man, Liam Campbell.
