‘We just made your day very exciting,’ a Southwest Airlines pilot radioed to the control tower as the plane veered off a taxiway at MacArthur Airport in Long Island on Thursday morning.

‘We just taxied off the taxiway into the grass,’ the unnamed pilot said, according to an audio recording on the Web site LiveATC.net.

The control tower was equally calm as he told the pilot he would dispatch fire and rescue.

'We just made your day very exciting': The Southwest Airlines plane veered off a taxiway at MacArthur Airport in Long Island on Thursday morning at 6.30 am

No one was hurt in the incident, which occurred moments before the jet was to take off for Tampa, Florida, at 6.30 am.

The more than 130 passengers, two pilots and three flight attendants on the Boeing 737 were evacuated from the airplane by stairs and then taken back to the airport terminal by bus, ABC News reported.

Southwest Airlines sent a replacement plane to the airport, and the passengers resumed their flight to Florida five hours behind schedule, the airline said.

Crews at MacArthur were working to get the stray plane back on the taxiway this afternoon.

South and the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the mishap.

MacArthur Airport was open for business on Thursday afternoon and evening, though some flights are still being delayed by weather.
