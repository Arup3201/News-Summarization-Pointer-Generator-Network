It may be just a stone's throw away from the mass urban sprawl that is New York, but nobody lives there and just an abandoned prison and empty lunatic asylum remain as evidence that the island was ever inhabited.

New York's mysterious Hart Island is, however, home to up to a million graves - many of them poor and unidentified, others interred there because of unfortunate circumstances.

The city's authorities have been using the island, which is technically part of the Bronx district, as a city graveyard, burying bodies in plain pine boxes piled on top of one another and marked only with a number, since 1868.

Long time practice: This archive picture shows prisoners from the now derelict Hart Island Prison burying bodies on the island. It is estimated that as many as one million people could be buried in mass graves there

Mass grave: A picture taken in 1990 shows a large trench dug ready for hundreds of bodies to be buried. Pine boxes used as coffins can be ssen at one end of the trench

The Department of Correction, which is in charge of the mass cemetary, estimates that there are between 750,000 and a million people buried on the island, which is visible on Google Maps but not included on the Subway line.

The last public ferry to the island completed its final journey in 1976.

According to Narratively, burials began at the island's northernmost tip, which became known as Potter's Field, when the city bought the island for $75,000.

But that cemetary reportedly filled up over the last few years and burials moved to the south side of the island.

City limits: Just within the boundaries of the Bronx is Hart Island where over 850,000 people are buried in New York City

In 2010, some 695 adults and 504 babies were buried there by prisoners from Riker's Island.Adult bodies are stacked three high with each grave containing up to 165 bodies and hidden from the world by 36 inches of dirt.

A separate grave for stillborn babies and foetuses contains as many as 1,000 miniature boxes.

Among those buried there is the first child to die of Aids in New York - one of the few to be afforded an individual grave marked SC B1 1985 (standing for Special Child, Baby 1, and the year of death) - as well as famous writers and actors including Bobby Driscoll who played Peter Pan in the 1953 DIsney movie.

Off limits: The mysterious island still appears on Google Maps, but access to it is restricted and members of the public need special permission to go there

Driscoll died in 1968 and his body was found in a deserted tenement by two children playing.

His body could not be identified and when it went unclaimed he was buried on Hart Island.

The following year his mother contacted Disney in the hope of reuniting Driscoll with his desparately ill father before he died.

But an NYPD fingerprint search located his body on Hart Island.

His name appears on his father's gravestone at a California cemetery, but his remains are still on Hart Island.

But, according Narratively, while many of those buried there are destitute or unidentified, others shouldn't be there at all.

Narratively cites the case of obstetrician and gynecologist Laurie Grant who gave birth to a stillborn baby in 1993.

Ms Grant almost died in the difficult delivery of the baby and was barely conscious when permission was granted to bury her child on Hart Island, although she could have afforded a funeral and her family already owned a burial plot.

Although between 60 and 80 people are disinterred a year to be buried elsewhere when family members claim the remains of their loved ones, others like Ms Grant are reluctant.

Many graves were destroyed when the Department of Defense operated a battery of Nike Ajax missiles there in the late 1950s and early 1960s in a bid to defend the city from potential nuclear attack from the Soviets.

Many bodies were also buried below the water table, meaning that the bodies and their coffins were all but destroyed and the plots were reused.

Although records of all bodies buried there have been written in logbooks, some were destroyed in a fire on the island in the 1970s - records of around 25,000 people were lost - and some are illegible.

Famous: It is not just poor people buried there. American actor Bobby Driscoll, pictured with his mother and father, Cletus and Isabelle in 1949, was buried there after his death in 1968

An error from 1989 and discovered years later found that two mass graves were given the same number.

One of the graves was later renumbered, but given the same marking as another grave from the 1970s.

Ms Grant's reason for not reclaiming the body of her stillborn baby?

'I don't trust their system', she told Narratively.
