Inquest: Lucy Boughton died aged 20 in a car crash on the A21 in Kent in October 2011, on a road which the Highways Agency had neglected

A former grammar school girl died on a notoriously treacherous bend with such a bad road surface it sent her car skidding into some trees, an inquest heard today.

A coroner today blasted the Highways Agency after hearing 'systemic failures' led to the death of 20-year-old Lucy Boughton.

The former Weald of Kent Grammar School pupil was at the wheel when her 
car crashed on October 24, 2011, skidding on the dual carriageway between Tunbridge Wells and Tonbridge in Kent.

Coroner Roger Hatch ruled said the reason the student's car left the A21 in Kent was the failure of the Highways Agency to maintain the road, despite evidence of a worsening safety record.

Mr Hatch heard how the Highways Agency had been repeatedly warned the road was unsafe.

But the inquest heard the authority failed to take action in the three years before Lucy’s death.

Her family, including dad Richard, mum Charlotte, sisters Amy, 22, Katie, 18, and brother Jack, 16, were at the inquest to hear the verdict that Lucy was not at fault for the accident.

Amy was a passenger in the car, a mint green Volkswagen Polo, driven by Lucy at the time of the accident.

Reliving the tragic day, she explained the pair were driving home to Sevenoaks from dinner in Tunbridge Wells in heavy rain.

She said: 'Halfway round the bend I felt the back of the car slip out and we started going towards the other side of the road.

'I called out to Lucy and she replied in panic "Oh my God". She tried to correct the car but it swung towards the trees.

'The next thing I recall is coming to and seeing headlights lighting up the tree trunks.'

Upset: The coroner blasted the Highways Agency for not spending money on resurfacing the road despite warnings it was dangerous

Tesco delivery van driver Matthew Elston, who was travelling in the opposite direction, described how the car swung left and veered off the road.

'It hit the trees and flipped over before landing on its wheels again,' he said.

Battle: Lucy's family revealed she had suffered from an eating disorder but had beaten it

Mr Elston and other witnesses described hearing other vehicles skidding on the bend after the accident.

Simon Phipps, an estate agent from Tonbridge, sent two e-mails to Kent County Council warning the road was unsafe before the tragedy.

In November 2010, Mr Phipps wrote: 'Please put down a skid-resistant surface before someone gets killed.'

Alexandra Luck, an independent consultant employed by Kent Police to investigate the accident, had similar concerns.

'I believe that there have been significant systemic failures to maintain the highway, despite a worsening safety record.'

Elio Rapa, a manager for the engineering consultants Balfour Beatty Mott MacDonald, explained that four investigations were carried out between May 2009 and 2011, but the route did not score high enough to receive funding.

He said: 'After the fatality we couldn’t wait for another to happen and the HA (Highways Agency) authorised funding for high-friction surfacing.'

Coroner Mr Hatch said: 'So it’s a question of money - the bend wasn’t a national priority but, when an accident like this happens, funds can suddenly be found?'

A Highways Agency spokesperson said today: 'Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Lucy Boughton following the tragic incident on the A21. We will give very careful consideration to any written recommendations from the Coroner.'

Meanwhile, Lucy’s family revealed how she had fought anorexia when she was a teenager and beat it.

On a website set up in memory of her, called Tributes to Lucy, the family said: 'When Lucy was a teenager this was one of the hardest times of her life. She developed an eating disorder called anorexia, and battled this until she was about 19.

'But she came through it and grew into the person she wanted to be and that we all knew she could be.

'All in all, she was an amazing person, she had been through so much, and come (sic) out a better person for it.

'Lucy - We’ll love you forever, we’ll remember you always, and you will live on in us for eternity. Sleep well our beautiful butterfly.'
