West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald told the club's official website: 'Since the start of December it's been full on and we're only just coming up for air at the start of March. 

'It's been a tough couple of months but what we normally do is go away so the lads can get a bit of sun on their backs.

'We do a bit of training in the gym and along the beach, as well as having a couple of football sessions. It's more important that they have a bit of relaxation time and get the sun on their backs.

'In last two or three months everyone’s had their tracksuit tops, gloves and hats on and it’ll be great to go across there and we’ll still be working, but special for the boys that it’s in the heat.'
