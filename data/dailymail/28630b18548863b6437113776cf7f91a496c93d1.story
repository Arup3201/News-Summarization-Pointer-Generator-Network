Premier League attendance levels last season were the highest in England's top division for 64 years, and more people attend Premier League games each season than in any league in the world, at almost 14 million.

As MailSport’s groundbreaking study of the world's major leagues shows, only Germany's Bundesliga can top the Premier League in any measure of turnstile success - fans attending per game.

The Bundesliga's figure of 42,609 fans per game is the biggest average in world football and the second biggest average in global professional sport - after American’s NFL.

The Premier League averaged 36,695 fans per game last season to be the second best attended football league per game by some margin ahead of La Liga in third (26,955 fans per game), then Italy’s Serie A (23,385), with Mexico's LigaMX (22,271) pushing France's Ligue 1 (21,155) out of the top five.

The Dutch Eredivisie and MLS in the USA and Canada are the seventh and eighth best attended leagues with more than 19,000 fans per game each.

In terms of total fans through the turnstiles, the Premier League, with 20 teams and 380 matches had 13.94 million fans coming through the turnstiles last season, or almost a million more than in the Bundesliga, where the 18 teams played 306 games.

The English Premier League came second in the standings from the study taken from 34 leagues worldwide 

The MLS had an average attendance of 19,000 fans per match, increasing by 2.9% on the 2013-14 season

The study looked at 34 leagues around the world, including the top divisions from 33 nations across Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia - plus the Championship from England as well.

The Premier League has the biggest aggregate attendance in the study (13.94m) then the Bundesliga (13m) and La Liga (10.2m) followed by the Championship, where the 552 games between the 24 teams were watched by 9.2m last season.

The Scottish Premiership is 21st on the list of 34 with 10,228 fans per game last season but that is down considerably since Rangers were demoted. It will be down again this season without either Hearts or Hibs in the top flight.

Barcelona recorded the highest average in the Spanish top flight, which sits third in the attendance league

Without having Rangers to add to the tally, the Scottish Premiership has seen a fall in average attendances
