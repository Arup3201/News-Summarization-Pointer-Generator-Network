James Rodriguez won the battle of the No 10s, but it is Neymar's Brazil who live to fight another World Cup day.

In the most bruising of all the encounters at these finals – 54 fouls is a record – it was hardly the setting for the tournament poster boys to shine.

But while Neymar showed flashes, Rodriguez burned brightly.

In the shadow: Neymar failed to outperform James Rodriguez but Brazil were 2-1 winners over Colombia

Bugged: Not even a giant insect could distract Rodriguez as he converted from the penalty spot

Pain game: Neymar, tended to by Rodriguez, left the field on a stretcher with a back injury

He created the opening for Colombia to win their late penalty and duly kept his cool to convert from the spot, despite the presence of a giant bug on his shoulder.

Rodriguez, though, had bugged Brazil throughout.

He recovered from each attempt to maim his frame – Fernandinho the chief culprit – and was the heartbeat of his side’s forward forays.

Brazil were already two goals to the good - Thiago Silva and David Luiz on target - by the time Rodriguez’s sixth goal of the finals halved the deficit with 11 minutes remaining and, try as he might, a deserved equaliser eluded the Monaco star.

Neymar, who had assisted Silva’s early opener, did eventually fall foul amid the rough stuff and, after Juan Zuniga’s knee landed in the small of his back, he left the field in tears on a stretcher.

It later emerged that Neymar had broken a vertebrae in his back. His World Cup is over, as is Rodriguez’s. Both of them will be sorely missed.

Danger: Rodriguez's heat map demonstrates the pockets he was populating

Hot: Neymar's involvement was not as concentrated but he still got on the ball in good areas

Head-to-head: Neymar and Rodriguez's stats compared

On the front foot: How did they compare in the final third?

Clock watch: Neymar versus James Rodriguez

3min – The pair have to wait three minutes for an involvement of note and on players find team-mates with ease – nerve-settlers, if they needed them that is.

4min – Neymar sizes a free-kick 25 yards out but, despite beating the Colombia wall, his effort also evades the target and drifts harmlessly wide. He is human, after all.

7min – GOAL: Brazil 1 Colombia 0 – Neymar wins the corner and takes the corner from which skipper Thiago Silva bundles home from close range. That’s his first assist of the finals, although to be fair he’s scored most of Brazil’s goals.

Lucky charm: Neymar receives a kiss from the player escort before the game

Flying: Neymar enjoyed a bright start to the game but faded as the first half wore on

12min – Neymar is at the heart of everything and, after skipping clear of a red shirt on halfway, he attempts to spring the front-running Maicon clear but the pass is intercepted, just.

14min – Rodriguez has seen precious little of the ball but when he finally does he’ll probably be wishing he hadn’t, Brazil’s Fernandinho upending him after a hefty challenge on the halfway-line. A little reducer from the Manchester City enforcer.

Marked man: Rodriguez feels the force of Fernandinho's challenge again

20min – Neymar delivers another pair of teasing flag-kicks but this time Colombia are alert to the danger and clear.

21min – Rodriguez escapes down the left and steals a yard for the cross but his final ball is poor and is hacked clear at the near post.

22min – Rodriguez shows his class with a mazy run and neat pass but Juan Cuadrado fails to match his comrade’s enterprise and his contribution comes to nothing. The No.10 is just starting to work his way into the game.

Eventually: Rodriguez escapes his minders but it comes to nothing

31min – It has been break-neck stuff and, amid the frenzy, Neymar’s radar has malfunctioned as he is guilty of a couple of wayward passes. We can forgive him that, though.

37min – Rodriguez takes an age to measure a free-kick 20 yards out but his curler is blocked by two yellow shirts who broke suspiciously early from the wall.

42min – Colombia are still to fashion a real chance and Rodriguez is again let down by his team-mates having drove forward and found Ibarbo on the left, who miscontrolled.

44min – Neymar wriggles free of his minder on the fringe of the penalty area and is duly impeded, winning a free-kick which he curls wide of Ospina’s goal. Replays show it wasn’t as close as the Brazilian’s pained expression had suggested.

Same again? Rodriguez had shaped to repeat his wonder goal from the last 16 but instead teed up a team-mate

HALF-TIME: Brazil 1 Colombia 0

47min – Neymar showboats inside the Colombia half with an outrageous piece of skill to evade his man but then beats himself with a step-over too many and possession is lost. It’s been that sort of night for him.

50min – With shades of Johan Cruyff, Rodriguez buys himself two yards of space 25 yards from goal but rather than shoot elects to play in Armero only for his through-ball to deflect into the grateful arms of Julio Cesar.

55mins – Neymar continues to be careless with his distribution and another pass goes astray.

63min – It’s Neymar’s turn to feel the force of some heavy treatment as Cuadrado sends his crashing to the turf on the left-wing. Neymar dusts himself off to deliver a lofted free-kick to the far post but Ospina claims. The delivery had too much height on, if anything.

67min – Rodriguez sees yellow for a sliding challenge which fells Hulk and the Colombian makes a point – quite rightly – of reminding the referee of the five fouls committed on himself which went unpunished.

Fall guy: Rodriguez's foul on Hulk led to Brazil's second goal

68min – GOAL: Brazil 2 Colombia 0 – And from the resulting free-kick David Luiz steps up to dispatch an absolute stunner into the top corner, all but booking the hosts’ place in the last four. Rodriguez and Co contest the award of the free-kick but it matters not.

73min – Neymar wants in on the act but the measurements of his carefully-designed curler are slightly out and the ball drifts wide with Ospina scrambling.

77min – Neymar kills dead a ball dropping from the sky just inside the area but within a split-second Mario Yepes is on him and snuffs out the danger.

78min – Rodriguez is the architect as his slick through-ball frees Bacca and the substitute is upended by the on-rushing Julio Cesar, who escapes a red card but concedes a penalty.

79min – GOAL: Brazil 2 Colombia 1 – And it is Rodriguez who takes responsibility and nonchalantly rolls the ball into the bottom corner for his sixth of the tournament.

Spot on: Rodriguez rolls home his sixth of the tournament

84min – Brazil are clinging on and, with Neymar missing, it’s Rodriguez taking centre stage as his side chase what had seemed an unlikely equaliser.

86min – Neymar is left in a heap after Zuniga’s knee thunders into his back and that’s enough to end his evening, the forward leaving the action in tears and on a stretcher.

Crying shame: Neymar is in tears as he is stretchered from the action

90min – Rodriguez has to be careful otherwise he could be following Neymar down the tunnel, the Colombia man barging Marcelo off the ball at the expense of a free-kick and then arguing his cause a little too forcefully with the referee.

93min – Rodriguez serves up another whipped corner but Zuniga’s header skips wide and Brazil survive.

FULL-TIME: Brazil 2 Colombia 1
