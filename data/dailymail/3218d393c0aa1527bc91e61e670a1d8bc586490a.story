Sheffield United football club should 'think really long and hard' about bringing back rapist Ched Evans after he is released from jail, Nick Clegg warned today.

The Deputy Prime Minister warned club bosses they cannot 'wish away' the Evans' rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just a footballers but role models to millions of fans.

To the fury of thousands of people, the club's manager Nigel Clough yesterday revealed officials had discussed bringing the striker back following his release from prison tomorrow.

Deputy PM Nick Clegg, a Sheffield MP, today suggested former Sheffield United striker Ched Evans, 25, should not return to the club after his release from prison on a rape conviction

The case has sparked huge controversy, following comments by ITV star Judy Finnigan in which she suggested Evans should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was 'drunk' and the rape was 'unpleasant' but 'not violent'.

The former Wales international, 25, was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire.

An online petition against Evans return to Sheffield United had attracted 90,000 supporters at the weekend, but by last night, more than 145,000 had put their names to it.

The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to 'refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player'.

It argues: 'To even consider reinstating him as a player at the same club is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist.'

Today Mr Clegg, an MP in Sheffield, appeared to suggest that he thought the club was wrong to offer Evans a way back. 

Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg told LBC: 'I think the owners need to think really long and hard about that fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days you are also taking on a role model. 

'You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on the football pitch on a team like that, and he has committed a very, very serious crime.'

Remarks: Evans, 25, who will be released from jail within days, has 'served his time', Miss Finnigan said

Mr Clegg repeatedly insisted it was a decision for the club and not for politicians, but added: 'I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people.

'My opinion is this; rape is an incredibly serious offence, unbelievably serious offence. 

'He has done his time but I just don't believe that the owners of the football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened. 

'And that is what he will be known for and that is something which, particularly for the youngsters following that team they will always be aware of. 

'I think football players these days, they get paid a lot of money, they are public figures and you can't ignore that.'

Rather than sack Evans when he was jailed, Sheffield United instead chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 2012.

Fighting back: Chloe Madeley was threatened with rape - by a coward behind a computer screen

Manager Clough told BBC Radio Sheffield yesterday: ‘We’ve had one or two discussions and the owners will make a decision on it.'

Professional Footballers’ Association chairman Gordon Taylor said last week that Evans should be allowed to continue his career on his release.

But former Sports Minister Richard Caborn, a lifelong Sheffield United fan, told the Daily Mail that Evans should not be allowed back on a football pitch unless he publicly apologised or his conviction was quashed on appeal, adding: ‘People should have a second chance as long as they acknowledge what they have done is wrong.’

Evans still maintains his innocence, and – thanks to support from his loyal girlfriend and her millionaire businessman father – has a slick campaign  making the case that he was wrongly convicted.

Judy Finnegan sparked fury during her debut as a panellist on Loose Women this week when she suggested Evans should be allowed to go back to the club. 

After a huge backlash about the remarks branded 'disgusting' and 'damaging', she was eventually forced to 'apologise unreservedly' for the offence she had caused.

However her daughter Chloe has since been viciously trolled online. Yesterday it was revealed police are investigating after a Twitter user told the 27-year-old, that her mother had given her 'blessing' for her to be raped.

Mr Clegg condemned the attacks on the daughter of TV's Richard and Judy. 'Whatever you think of what Judy said... it is outrageous that people are being as menacing and vile towards Chloe in that way.

'There are laws of course that can lead to people being prosecuted if they are inciting hatred or violence towards other people.

'It has got to stop. It is just not on that someone can say something in the way that they did and their daughter gets targeted in such a threatening and offensive way.' 

Chloe Finnegan today hit back at her attackers. In an article for the Mail she wrote: 'I was horrified, and disgusted. I was livid that someone could attack me and my family in such a way.

'Social media might make people seem less real, might make comments seem less personal, but I am a real person with real, very human emotions.

'The trolls have seized upon this and are issuing us with all kinds of abuse. My father is protective – as any man would be given such threats – and has taken screen shots of the messages.

'He says he will be reporting them to the police and that prosecution awaits. I certainly hope that the vile trolls who threatened to rape me will get their just deserts.'

The South Yorkshire club has refused to comment on a possible return for Evans, who was capped 13 times for Wales before his conviction

A petition urging Sheffield United not to reinstate Ched Evans once he is released from prison has been signed by 141,173 people.

So far the club, which signed Evans for £3million in 2009, has refused to say whether it will take him back.

Women's rights campaigner Jean Hatchet set up the petition on the website Change.org, calling on the club's chairman Kevin McCabe and part-owner Prince Abdullah Bin Musa'ad Bin Abdul Aziz to make it clear that Evans – who still maintains his innocence – will not be welcome.

In an open letter to the pair, she said: 'I'm sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before. Unfortunately, he still hasn't acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury. He will be returning, if Sheffield Utd resign him, to a position where he has huge influence over young fans.

'They must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime. Young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that … consent to sex is essential or the act is rape.'

During the trial in 2012, Evans admitted having sex with the victim in a hotel room straight after his friend and former Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, but denied rape.

Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey and Professional Footballers' Association chief Gordon Taylor have backed his return. Sheffield United did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.
