Stuart Armstrong will spend Tuesday night hastily writing an Open University law degree essay after it was put on hold to complete his transfer to Celtic.

The 22-year-old midfielder made the move from Dundee United to Parkhead on Monday, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal just before the transfer window closed.

He was joined by team-mate Gary Mackay-Steven, who, having already signed a pre-contract agreement with the Hoops, fast-forwarded his departure from Tannadice after the two clubs agreed a fee.

The 24-year-old winger signed a four-and-a-half-year deal with the Tayside club reportedly raking in a total of around £2million.

At a joint press conference at Celtic Park, Armstrong confirmed his reputation as one of the game's more cerebral players.

He said: 'It has been a busy couple of days. I have an essay due tomorrow morning of 2,000 words that I haven't even started.

'So once I am done here, I will crack on with that.

'I have got a few months of this year (left) and two more years after that.

'I go through about a month each year thinking about packing it in but I think I will see it through.

'It is a nice thing to have. I had a lot of free time in the afternoon and it was something I was quite interested in at school.

'I had a look at the Open University and the process - not the work - seemed easy enough.

'And it is useful. It keeps your mind on other thing sometimes.

'I wouldn't say it is the necessary route for everyone, I think everyone has their own interests.

'But sometimes it is important to keep your mind off football.'
