Rivers, creeks dams and streams claim more Australian lives than even our roughest beaches, according to a new report

Over the past decade, 735 people died while swimming in rivers, creeks and streams, with 46 per cent of those incidents occurring in regional or remote areas.

Released on Wednesday,the Royal Lifesaving Society's Drowning Deaths in Australian Rivers report reveals that nearly 40 per cent of those incidents involved alcohol.

Remote rivers, creeks and streams claimed the most lives in Australia at 'aquatic locations' a new study revealed, pictured is The Murray River where more people drowned than anywhere else in the country

Of that 40 per cent, more than two thirds involved people with a blood alcohol concentration higher than 0.05, which is the legal driving limit.

Royal Life Saving chief Justin Scarr told AAP that people underestimate the danger of entering these remote waterways.Â

'Rivers account for more drownings than beaches or swimming pools.'

'The flat, still appearance of rivers often lull people into a false sense of safety.'

Less people lost their lives at beaches or swimming pools than in calm rural waterways

'Time and again we see people taking unnecessary risks that often have tragic outcomes, especially where alcohol is involved.' he continued.

The report also revealed that 80 per cent of those who died in creeks and rivers were male, while a quarter of all drownings were people aged 25 to 44 years old.

Mr Scarr said people need to shift their thinking when undertaking activities in remote areas.

Though there is knowledge of beach safety, less is known about preventing drownings in rivers the study says

'It's high time that people treated rivers with the same respect they have learned to show when recreating at the beach.'

The Murray River claimed the most lives of any location in the country, with a death toll of 43.

The Brisbane River in Queensland and the Yarra River in Victoria ranked second and third.

These were followed by the Swan River (WA), Hawkesbury River (NSW), Murrumbidgee River (NSW), Sandy Creek (QLD), Derwent River (TAS), Katherine River (NT) and the Macquarie River (NSW).
