Southampton

Morgan Schneiderlin could play in Southampton's Capital One Cup quarter-final at Sheffield United after recovering from a groin injury.

Schneiderlin has not played this month and could join James Ward-Prowse in midfield, with the 20-year-old a possible starter after returning following a two-month absence with an ankle problem against Burnley.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Sheffield United have been knocked out of the Cup at this stage on three occasions, though they did progress the last time they reached the quarter-finals (vs C. Palace, 2002/03).

Southampton have failed to score in four of their last five trips to Bramall Lane in all competitions.

This will be the first meeting between Sheffield United and Southampton in the League Cup.

Southampton have made the quarter-finals of the League Cup for the first time since 2003/04. However, they’ve not reached the semi-final stage since 1986/87, when they were eliminated by Liverpool.

Graziano Pellè has bagged three goals in three appearances in the League Cup this term. Pellè has, however, had more shots in the competition (17, inc. blocked) this season than any other player.

The Blades have scored two and conceded 15 in their last five League Cup ties against sides from a higher division.

The Saints have won nine of their last 10 games against lower ranked sides in this competition (L1).
