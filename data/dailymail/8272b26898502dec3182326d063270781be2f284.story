It’s unlikely Tony Corrente was best pleased when he landed on the ground after being knocked over in a brawl during the Baltimore Ravens v Pittsburgh Steelers NFL game last autumn.

But the veteran NFL referee is now thanking the players who ended up causing him to be pushed over after he was diagnosed with throat and tongue cancer while being treated following his fall.

High school social sciences teacher Tony Corrente, 60, of La Mirada, California, has now started a second round of chemotherapy since the moment when he tried to split up a scrum last September.

‘Getting knocked down and hurt in that Baltimore game might have saved my life,’ Mr Corrente told Sports Illustrated. ‘Had I not done anything… I probably wouldn’t have discovered this for a while.’

Mr Corrente added that after he was knocked down during the NFL game he took the drug Motrin, which thins blood. He started to cough up blood soon after, which made him see a throat specialist.

He was diagnosed with cancer and soon began a seven-week programme of chemo and radiation therapy at a hospital in Houston, Texas, that saw him lose his hair, reported Sports Illustrated.

But he was back working at the Baltimore Ravens v Cincinnati Bengals game on November 20 - just over two months after the incident during the Ravens game against the Steelers on September 11.

At the game Mr Corrente spoke to Ravens players Michael Oher and Matt Birk, who were involved in the scrum that led to him eventually being diagnosed with cancer, reported Sports Illustrated.

He told the ‘shocked’ duo that they may have actually saved his life. ‘This crazy ref was thanking them because they knocked him on his butt,’ Mr Corrente told Sports Illustrated.

Mr Corrente’s most recent appearance as an official was at the New Orleans Saints v Detroit Lions game on Saturday. Two days later he started a second round of treatment, reported ABC News.

He told Sports Illustrated that he felt weak after the Saints v Lions game and won’t be taking part in the rest of the NFL playoffs - but is hopeful of a comeback next season.

Mr Corrente also wants to thank the Steelers players who knocked him over - Ryan Mundy and LaMarr Woodley. Doctors believe it’s likely he’ll be fit again to referee again next season.

He has received tremendous support. ‘You hear it's the "No Fun League", or it's "Not For Long",’ Mr Corrente told Sports Illustrated. ‘I'll tell you what the league is - it's the "National Family League".’
