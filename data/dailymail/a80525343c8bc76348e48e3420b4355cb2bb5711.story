A bodyguard to the stars who protected the likes of Lady Gaga, Jay Z, Beyonce and Nelson Mandela has been killed by police after a bizarre break-in, according to reports.

Norman Oosterbroek, 43, nicknamed the Dutch Giant given his 6 ft 5, 280 pounds stature, allegedly broke into a Miami mansion naked around 10.45pm on Monday night, the Miami Herald reports.

Homeowners Markus and Christiane Jung reported the intruder after Mrs Jung heard a noise outside and found Oosterbroek on their property.

When police arrived they found the bodyguard fighting with Mr Jung.

According to the report, officers said they saw him ingest an unknown substance during the fight before he violently resisted arrest.

They tasered him in the chest and he collapsed at the scene. He was pronounced dead a short time later at Baptist Hospital.

Authorities say the father-of-two, who was photographed the world over accompanying stars to events, had long had drug issues.

According to the Herald, he had been in and out of rehab for years.

Many hoped his problems were behind him in 2009 when he married girlfriend April McDaniel in a lavish ceremony at New York's Botanical Garden.

The pair and their two children split their time between the city and South Florida where they were renting a four-bedroom, three-bathroom $500,000 home next to the Jungs.

He appeared to be returning home when he wrongly ended up outside the Jung mansion.

'He was highly violent, uncontrollable and obviously wasn’t stable,' Nancy Perez, spokeswoman for Miami-Dade police, which is investigating the incident, told the newspaper.

Officers said they believed he was ingesting cocaine on the basis of his heightened body temperature.

It is the second time in recent months that Miami police have been involved in a taser death.

Colombian-born Israel Hernandez-Llach died after police shocked him as he ran away from officers who caught him spray-painting the wall of a shuttered McDonald's.

Police would not divulge how many times Oosterbroek was struck on Monday night or how many officers were involved in his arrest, according to the report.

After beginning his career as a guard to Mandela, Oosterbroek went on to form his own private security firm named RAD.

Mrs Jung said they hardly knew their neighbor and were still traumatized by Monday night's events.

“Our family needs time to heal. This was really, really horrible and we can’t talk about it now,” Mrs Jung told the paper.

'I can tell you that Pinecrest police took very good care of us. It was horrifying.'

'We're still awaiting toxicology reports,' Det. Javier Baez, a Miami Dade Police Department spokesman said.

'It’s possible that he may have been under some type of a narcotics. Again, he was observed swallowing, ingesting some kind of substance, unknown substance that is.'
