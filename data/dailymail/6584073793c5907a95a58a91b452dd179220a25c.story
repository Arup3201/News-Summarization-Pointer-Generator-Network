Inmates at a state prison in Florida have were allegedly stripped naked, sprayed with toxic chemicals, and had their beds taken away for little or no reason as part of a brutal disciplinary regime.

Prisoners at the Northwest Florida Reception Center, near Panama City, were reportedly beaten and even threatened with having their fingers broken while other guards manipulated surveillance cameras to perpetuate the harsh system which they called 'the program'.

According to allegations from prisoners and former guards, the perpetrators and their superiors engineered a conspiracy of silence around the shocking practices, which meant that any concerns raised were swept away.

'Brutality': Central to the harsh allegations is corrections officer Captain James Kirkland, left, who was reportedly a prolific user of chemicals on inmates. Rommell Johnson, right, was an asthmatic prison who died after he had pepper spray used on him

Meanwhile, they claim, those who voice concerns were harassed, mocked and even fired as a consequence of trying to speak out.

The allegations about Northwest Florida, which have prompted several investigations and lawsuits, were collated and published in a long report by the Miami Herald.

In the most extreme circumstances, a prisoner even died during one of the apparently routine 'gassings'.

Rommell Johnson, an asthmatic inmate, was blasted with burning pepper spray in June 2010 despite having been treated for his condition that same morning.

The Herald reported that officers then left him laying in his cell, while he foamed at the mouth. By the time they called paramedics, it was too late and he soon died.

Prison complex: The alleged abuse took place over years at the Northwest Florida Reception Center, above

Using pepper spray - and in more extreme cases tear gas - is a legal and recognized punishment in the Florida prison system, used to subdue very disruptive inmates.

But, according to the reports, use of the dangerous chemicals - which are blasted repeatedly into inmate's cells through a flap - was taken to extremes at Northwest Florida.

The punishment was allegedly used so routinely that corrections officers would fake excuses to use the gas, and in some cases would even fill out paperwork justifying their use of the gas the day before.

One officer, Captain James Kirkland, would reportedly gas inmates as punishment if they filed complaints about him.

Some said he would lash out for completely irrational reasons, such as seeing inmates holding rubber bands.

One prisons officer, Jerry Sellers, said Kirkland accused him of 'cowardice' for not joining in with a depraved scheme to 'break every finger' in an inmate's hand to punish him.

Sellers then claims he was forced to resign by a superior.

Kirkland, and five other guards, were eventually charged and arrested over abuse at the prisons - but the officer, who was reportedly suffering mental health problems, killed himself before he could stand trial.

Prisoners also reported having their mattresses taken away, and going as long as 72 hours with nothing to sleep on but a hard, prison-issue bedframe. 

The abuse is said to spread over years at the prison. Authorities have since pledged to reform the system and tighten up disciplinary procedures for corrections officers.

However, critics say that the heads of the prison service say that until the heads of the prison are gone, the problems will persist.

Josh Glickman, a civil rights lawyer representing a prisoner who is suing the authorities, said: 'The individuals actually responsible for the abuse to repeatedly occur and continue are still very much a part of today’s Department of Corrections'.
