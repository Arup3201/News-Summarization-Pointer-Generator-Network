A council tenant who carried out numerous 'home improvements' on his rented property has been sent a £5,000 bill to cover the cost of putting his botched DIY projects right.

George Brassington, 71, fitted new doors, a sink and even built a shed at the three-bedroom council house he shared with wife Ivy for 20 years.

He also demolished an old pantry at the side of the kitchen to create a space for a tumble dryer, got his colleagues to help with plumbing and electrical work and fitted two external security lights.

But after moving out, housing association officials ruled his DIY work would be 'dangerous' for future tenants and has sent Mr Brassington a £5,000 bill to cover the cost of fixing them. 

Home DIY: George Brassington, 71, is pictured with a bill for £5,000 from First Choice Homes Oldham to fix botched DIY work he carried out at his Manchester council house

Home sweet home: Mr Brassington fitted new, and sometimes ill-fitting, doors, pictured above, at the 
property in Oldham, Manchester.  He also knocked down a
pantry to make room for a tumble dryer and asked colleagues to help him with plumbing and electrical work during the 20 years he lived at 
the house with wife Ivy

They sent the retired pensioner a letter and enclosed a bill including £2,500 for a complete re-wire of the property plus £2,300 for replacing the doors, kitchen units and even skirting boards and curtain rails.

He is also being charged for new floor tiles, the cost of patching up the bathroom ceiling and even a new toilet seat for the property in Oldham, Manchester.

They warned Mr Brassington he faced legal action if he failed to pay - but First Choice Homes Oldham eventually agreed to let him pay off the outstanding bill at £3.55 a week. It means he will be 97-years-old when the balance is cleared.

The grandfather-of-ten said: 'The letter came as a massive shock. As far as I was concerned the work I did over the years was of a good quality and added value to the house.

'We lived there for 20 years so were bound to change some things and I wanted to make the place looking nice. I’m not a DIY disaster - far from it, I used to work in the building trade.

'We decorated the house and I put a shed
in the back garden. I changed a couple of the doors inside to ones that
were more expensive and I fitted a new sink in the kitchen.

Handy man: Mr Brassington had also built his own shed, apparently with a collection of wooden planks, pictured above, at the property in 
Oldham, Manchester, before the couple moved out earlier this year

Costly: But when Mr Brassington and his wife moved out of the property in Oldham, Greater Manchester, to a smaller bungalow, they were sent a £5,000 bill to cover the cost of fixing his DIY work

'I also fitted a security light to make sure we could deter burglars - and moved a light in one of the rooms, but I got an electrician to do that for me. It was good job - not some fly-by-night cowboy operation.

'We’re pensioners and can’t afford to pay this amount of money. It’s unfair they’re taking this out on us. All of the work was carried out by professionals I know through my career in the building trade and was completed with quality materials. I can’t believe these people are saying its botched job.'

The elderly couple were sent the bill after downsizing to a smaller bungalow a mile away in nearby Holts.

As an incentive, First Choice Homes Oldham even promised £300 to aid his move. But just months after settling into their new home the letter dropped through the letter box saying he was liable for £4,977 of 'rechargeable repairs'.

It said £178 pounds was being billed for a 'cleanse’ to the property which it then said referred to items being removed which had been left behind.

Debt: Mr Brassington has been told by First Choice Homes Oldham that he can pay back the bill at £3.55 a week - meaning he will be 97-years-old when the balance is cleared

The letter added: '£2,500 is a for 
full electrical re-wire which was necessary due to major and dangerous 
DIY electrics both internally and externally to the property.'

The firm is currently completing a major
£149 million project including a new builds programme, asset 
management, and repairs and maintenance for its stock of 12,000 
properties in Oldham.

Mr 
Brassington said: 'At the moment all of the neighbouring properties are 
being done up with new wiring and bathrooms being put in. I can’t 
believe they are chasing me for this money. It’s not much for them but 
it’s a phenomenal amount for me.

Charges: This copy of the bill sent to Mr Brassington shows the breakdown of the costs of repairing his DIY work - reaching a total of £4,977.74

'I
said to them: "What am I actually paying for?" The reality is it will 
take so long to settle the balance, I’ll be dead before I’ve paid it all
off.'

Mr Brassington's
local Citizens Advice Bureau, which has written to the housing 
association on his behalf, said: 'We believe that our client, however 
misguided, carried out certain work in good faith and in the belief that
he was in fact improving the property.

'Considering
the simultaneous regeneration of the area and, as we understand it, 
this property we would like to request that the debt be written off.'

But Dave Woods from First Choice Homes Oldham said: 'Tenants have a right to make improvements and alterations but there are requirements to ensure works are carried out to a certain standard. Written consent must be sought from us before any work is carried out.

'Specifically the must comply with planning or building regulations and any work related to electricity or gas apparatus systems or equipment has to be carried out by a suitably qualified person.

'The tenancy handbook also clearly states that if a customer carries out improvement work either without first seeking our permission or after we have refused permission they could end up reinstating the property to its original condition.

'We may also take legal action for breaching tenancy conditions.'

Mr Woods added: 'The tenancy agreement states that if or when a customer moves out of a home they must either leave the improvement in good working order or remove it and make good the original fitting at their expense so we can re-let the property.

'Failure to do this will mean a recharge for putting right any work that is not of the required standard, is unsafe unfinished or is in any breach of any other regulation.'

New home: George and Ivy Brassington were given £300 to entice them to move to a smaller property, pictured, but it has ended up costing them thousands of pounds more
