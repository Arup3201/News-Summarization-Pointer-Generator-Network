Army officials have found what they believe to be the wreckage of a military aircraft and possible bone tissue scattered on a glacier in Alaska.

The debris was spotted by Alaska Army National Guardsmen on board a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter flying a routine training mission at around 1pm local time on Sunday, officials from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson said yesterday.

'It looks like it is a military aircraft,' said Air Force Master Sergeant Mikal Canfield, a spokesman for the Anchorage base. No other details about the wreckage were available, he said.

The base called the wreck possibly 'historic' and said the Federal Aviation Administration had issued a temporary flight restriction for the area, but did not elaborate.

Nothing has been taken from the site, pending further investigation, Canfield said.

At the request of Alaska military officials, the Hawaii-based U.S. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) is trying to plan a recovery mission at the Knik Glacier site near Anchorage, a spokeswoman said.

JPAC, which focuses on search and recovery missions for missing U.S. service members, hopes to schedule an Alaska trip and line up necessary expertise to work on the glacier, said Captain Jamie Dobson, a spokeswoman for the command.

'We believe that there's a reason for JPAC to be involved,' she said.

No details about the crash are being released in case next of kin need to be notified.
