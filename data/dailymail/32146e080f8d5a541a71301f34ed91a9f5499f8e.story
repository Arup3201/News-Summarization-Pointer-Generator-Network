'It was a very nice surprise to win and I got a new crown and a new sash and I'm now able to take on some charitable work around the UK rather than just England, which feels great.'

She continued: 'I think I've always been a young lady pursuing an academic career but I made a decision to take a risk and do something out of the ordinary and it paid off.
