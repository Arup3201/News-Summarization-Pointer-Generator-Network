A genuine European candidate in Dutch football chief Michael van Praag on Monday declared he will stand against Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency.

Van Praag had been reluctant to put his name forward having witnessed a number of eastern European countries supporting Blatter and voting against UEFA proposals at last June’s FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo.

The Dutchman can’t count on the support of his confederation, but has nevertheless put his hat in the ring along with Prince Ali of Jordan and the fanciful no-hopers Jerome Champagne, bookmaker-funded David Ginola and football agent Mino Raiola - none of whom will get the required nominations from five countries.

Van Praag said: ‘It is high time that the organisation comes back into the real world and puts the focus back on football.

‘I had hoped that a credible opponent (to Blatter) would emerge, but that’s simply not happened. In that case you cannot just talk but you must also act decisively and take responsibility so therefore I am announcing my candidacy.’

UEFA did not back him on Monday. Chief executive Gianni Infantino said: ‘There is no candidate of UEFA because UEFA has no vote. We provide the platform for everybody to express their opinion. There has to be an open debate on the future of football.’  

Dutch FA (KNVB) secretary general Bert van Oostveen added: 'It is clear that something has to change in FIFA to restore credibility. Michael is the right man for this. The KNVB will fully support him in his campaign.'

Van Praag will formally announce his candidacy at a news conference in Amsterdam on Wednesday.

UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino said the European governing body would not be formally backing either Van Praag or Prince Ali.

He told a news conference: 'We have heard about Prince Ali and we have heard about Michael van Praag and it is good there is a proper discussion.

'We are an open democracy, we have different views and the important thing is everyone can express his views.'

Van Praag said he had obtained the minimum five nominations from national associations but the Football Association has yet to decide who it will support - that is likely to take place at a board meeting on Thursday.

David Ginola is expected to withdraw his candidacy to replace Sepp Blatter as FIFA presidency on Thursday

Ginola is expected to be forced to withdraw as a FIFA candidate on Thursday after failing to gain the required nominations.

The former Tottenham and France winger is being backed by a bookmaker but his campaign to raise £100,000 in public money has so far raised only £5,900.

Meanwhile, UEFA confirmed England's David Gill and Welsh FA president Trefor Lloyd Hughes will contest an election voted for by European nations to be named Britain's next FIFA vice-president to succeed Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce.

Current president Michel Platini will be re-elected unopposed at the UEFA Congress in March. 

UEFA has also announced that England will host the European under-17 championships in 2017.
