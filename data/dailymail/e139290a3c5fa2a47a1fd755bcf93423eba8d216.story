Three years after the biggest nuclear disaster since Chernobyl struck the east coast of Japan, many regions still lie desolate.

The clean-up effort is hindered due to the continued risk of radiation to human workers and, as a result, drones have been sent in to record the destruction.

During this mission, one drone captured the sheer extent of the devastation as it swept across the Japanese ghost town of Tokioma.

Scroll down for video 

The footage, pictured, was taken by Tokyo-based multicopter firm HEXaMedia. During the eight-minute video, the drone soars over Tokioma's radioactive and barren landscapes.

The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011.

It
 was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake.

This led to three of the plant’s six nuclear reactors going 
into meltdown and releasing radioactive materials. 

Reports claim the soil and water in the region still contains high levels of radiation which makes the clean-up effort difficult. 

A total of 300,000 people evacuated the 
Fukushima area on the east coast and 15,884 people died due to the 
earthquake and tsunami.

The footage was taken by Tokyo-based multicopter firm HEXaMedia.

During the eight-minute video, the drone soars over the region’s landscapes said to be covered in radioactive soil.

It travels over the coast capturing how it was battered and destroyed by the tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake in 2011.

A train station is shown as abandoned, a school field remains empty and a fishing boat has been dropped on the land miles away from the sea.

In one shot, a blooming Cherry Blossom tree contrasts against the abandoned buildings and brown wasteland in the background.

Tokioma had more than 15,800 residents across 6,000 houses, schools and business and all of them are still prevented from returning to their homes, pictured. A total of 300,000 people evacuated the Fukushima area on the east coast and 15,884 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami

A total of 300,000 people evacuated the Fukushima area on the east coast, and 15,884 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami.

As of August last year, 1,600 of these deaths were due to people living in temporary housing and not having access to hospitals or medical care.
