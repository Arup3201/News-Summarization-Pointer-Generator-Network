The 13-year-old boy who was found behind a false wall at the weekend after being missing for four years has told how he used his phone to contact his biological mother.

Gregory Jean Jr. said: 'I just went on [Google] Play Store and I downloaded an app called Magic Jack and I called my mom.'

It is not clear how the teenager managed to get hold of the phone, but once downloaded the App allows users free calling to the US and Canada.

Gregory went missing in 2010, when he went to visit his father Gregory Jean, 37, and his stepmother Samantha Joy Davis, 42 - the pair are both charged with the false imprisonment and cruelty against Gregory at their home in Jonesboro, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia.

Davis is on probation for punishing her biological son by cutting his tongue with a pair of hot scissors in 2004.

Today his biological mother, Lisa Smith told CBS46 she had talked to her son a few times during the four-year period he was missing and said their emotional reunion 'feels good.'

She said she now has custody of Gregory and added that she was a U.S. citizen but refused to comment on why she had not  reported her son missing.

A press conference today revealed that the 'hidden compartment' where Gregory was found, was an attic space connected to a garage by a crawl-through in a linen closet.

When police attended the home at 11pm on Friday they could originally not find the boy, but Gregory then gave them more details and they returned - he was found behind the 'access panel' at 2am.

'The victim had signs of physical assault and was very emotionally distraught,' Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter said, reports NBC News.

The police supervisor who found him said that after he calmed down, Gregory kept repeating his thanks and gratitude.

Police said Gregory had been in the attic area 'temporarily' and actually shared a bedroom with one of the other juveniles in the home.

In court on Sunday, a judge revealed that Davis allegedly hit the boy on his buttocks and legs with a stick.

Arrests: The boy went missing in 2010, when he went to see his father and never returned. His mother allegedly never informed police since she is an immigrant and unfamiliar with the system. Above, the house where he was held captive

No clue: Neighbors in the Jonesboro neighborhood said they often saw the boy outside the house, and never thought he was being held prisoner

He denied a bond after learning that Davis is currently on probation in Henry County for child cruelty. 

The judge also denied a bond for Jean and said a fugitive of justice case appeared on the record of Jean, who is a U.S. citizen from Haiti.

'They dismissed the case,' Jean insisted. 'That was not me. They had the wrong person.' 

Judge Richard Brown refused both suspects bail and they were remanded to Clayton County Jail until their next appearance on December 9. 

There is no indication Gregory attended school, and neighbors have said they often saw him doing yard work. 

Neighbors in the Atlanta, Georgia suburb  have spoken out to say they saw the boy often and never knew he was being held against his will.

Investigation: CID officers are pictured arriving at the house on Saturday morning. An investigation is ongoing

Jean's neighbor's in the Atlanta suburb of  Jonesboro were shocked to hear that the Gregory was a prisoner.

They say they often saw him outside the house, sometimes doing yard work. 

'It was a shock to all of us. They were really nice people, very open they said come over anytime you want,' neighbor Julie Pizarro, who lives across the street told WXIA. 'The young man didn't seem under any distress. I guess you never know what's behind closed doors.'

'Gosh, it was right under our nose,' neighbor Akono Ekundayo said. 'We could have done something.'

In heart-wrenching scenes on Saturday morning, Gregory was pictured clinging on to his weeping mother, who had traveled to Georgia, as another female relative sobbed uncontrollably nearby in an emotional reunion.

Sergeant Joanne Southerland, of Clayton County Police Department, told the news station: 'We came here to the home and were able to get inside and talk to the people inside.

'After several minutes of denying that the child was here and that there was ever any assault or anything like that, we were able to find him in the linen closet.'

Officer Daniel Day added: 'I just couldn't believe it. We found him, we saw him. To say it was a great feeling is an understatement. He just couldn't thank us enough, he was overjoyed we had found him.'
