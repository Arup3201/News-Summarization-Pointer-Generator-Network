Gina DeJesus' mother collapsed on the ground and cried out for vengeance when she saw her daughter alive after learning she had been held captive for nine years, a family friend has revealed. 

'Matalo!' Nancy Ruiz shouted as she fell to the ground, Lupe Collins told MailOnline on Wednesday.

The phrase is Spanish for 'Kill him.'

Happy ending: Gina DeJesus, pictured, disappeared in 2004 and was not 
seen until Monday, when she was freed from the Cleveland home belonging 
to Ariel Castro

Relief: Gina DeJesus' mother Nancy, pictured left with Gina's father Felix, shouted 'Matalo' when she learned her daughter was still alive, which means 'kill him'

Ms Collins says her fury was directed
at Ariel Castro - the father of Gina's best friend - who has been 
arrested and accused of kidnapping Gina in 2004.

Ms Collins says she rushed to the 
home on Seymour Avenue after hearing that Gina and two other missing 
women were found captive there.

She said she watched as an FBI agent 
showed Gina to Mrs DeJesus so she could positive identify that the woman
police had rescued was her daughter. 

Ms Collins says she worked closely 
with Gina's parents Nancy Ruiz and Felix DeJesus to raise community 
awareness of Gina after she was abducted while walking home from Burger 
King.

Ariel Castro's daughter Arlene is thought to be the last person who saw Gina before her disappearance.

On Tuesday, Ariel's son Anthony told 
MailOnline that he thought it was possible his father targeted Gina 
because of her relationship with Arlene.

Gina DeJesus gave a thumbs up as she arrived home on Wednesday before being hurried into her mother's home shielded by family.

Hundreds of well-wishers gathered in front of the DeJesus property, which was covered in balloons and signs, reading 'Welcome home Gina.'

Nancy Ruiz spoke on Wednesday and asked for the family to be given time to heal.

She thanked those who had supported the family over the years along with the police and FBI for all their hard work.

Ms Ruiz appealed to the public to be on 
the look-out for another missing girl Ashley Summers, who was snatched 
in 2007 from the same Cleveland neighborhood when she was 14.

Ms Ruiz said: 'There are not enough words to say or express for the joy we feel for the return of our family member Gina.

'We are asking for your support to be patient with us. Give us time and privacy to heal. When we're ready, I promise you…we will talk to you.'

Miss DeJesus' mother and father smiled and gave thumbs up to supporters. 

'They never gave up hope. Felix never gave up hope that she was alive,' said neighbor Michael Pendershot, 47, who lives three houses down from the DeJesus family.
