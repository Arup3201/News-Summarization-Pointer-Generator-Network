Michael Schumacher is no longer in a coma and has been transferred from the hospital in Grenoble where he had been receiving treatment to the University Hospital Lausanne in Switzerland

The battle for Michael Schumacher's coma recovery has apparently entered a new phase with him being moved out of intensive care into a rehabilitation ward.

If true, it means that Schumacher, 45, is out of danger from dying from his injuries - but the level of progress he has made remains questionable.

It comes four months after doctors announced they would begin the process of awaking him from the 
artificially induced coma he was placed in following a ski accident in 
the French Alps on December 19 last year.

However, experts say if he was going to wake up, he would have done so by now.

Medical sources always said that there would come a point when doctors would have to inform his wife Corinna, brother Ralf and father Rolf that there is nothing more they can do for him on the emergency station.

A rehab ward means he will still receive the same massage therapy and muscle toning that he has been getting daily but that doctors no longer expect significant improvements - certainly in the short term - in his condition.

'Schumacher's transfer to a special rehabilitation clinic is being prepared and the chances of full recovery have dropped,' said Bunte.

Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm has not resonded to the latest report in Germany's popular weekly magazine Bunte.

The Abendzeitung in Munich also quoted unnamed medical sources saying that he had been moved within the hospital.

It has been more than five months since Schumacher's tragic skiing crash in the slopes of Meribel in the French Alps.

The seven-time world champion's family and manager last spoke about Schumacher's health condition in the middle of April, stating that the German ace has 'moments of consciousness and awakening.' Since then there have been no fresh updates, fuelling speculation that he will not make a full recovery.

The seven-times Formula One world champion had sustained severe head injuries in the incident in the French Alps in December, and was subsequently put into an artificially-induced coma a few days later

Schumi in a coma, unable to speak or move, is still able to dominate newspaper headlines and TV broadcasts from Alaska to Zagreb yet fears remain that he is in a permanent vegative state.

Most patients in an artificial coma come around after a fortnight: Schumi is in his sixth month in such a condition.

There has been no flicker of the eyes, no flexing of a fingertip, no uttered sound. Just the blipping of the machinery that feeds him, medicates him, breathes for him and removes the waste from a body that has lost a quarter of its weight since the Alpine accident robbed him of the life he knew.

Last week it was reported Schumacher's coma recovery had apparently entered a new phase with him being moved out of intensive care into a rehabilitation ward

The greatest: Schumacher is a seven-time Formula One World Champion and is widely regarded as one of the greatest F1 drivers of all time

With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.

Corinna knows it is the least she can do for the man she described as the 'perfect partner.' She and Schumacher met in 1991 on the F1 circuit after she was previously married to racing driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen.

She once said: 'Michael's passion for racing is just huge, it would have been impossible without this deep passion; this passion has made him, who he is. I got to know him as a racer, and I had previously always had fullest confidence in him.'

But she made him promise after a 2009 motorcycle accident in Spain that almost landed him in a wheelchair that the days of thrills and spills must be tempered. Out of love, he toned down his lifestyle.

He referred to his marriage as 'total harmony,' adding: 'We have the same vision of how we want to spend our lives. My wife Corinna and our harmonious family - that is my main force always at play in the background.'

That is why 'she would view breaking faith with the hope of a miracle a betrayal, little better than treachery,' added the family friend. 'She feels that the family communes around his bedside pulsate their hope and love to him, and that of the millions of fans worldwide who share that faith. She cannot express defeat because that would be the end of her.'Â
