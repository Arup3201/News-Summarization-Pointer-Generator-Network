Two days after revealing evidence about her daughter Ayla's disappearance, Trista Reynolds chased the girl's father and screamed 'murderer' at him in the street.

Justin DiPietro was ambushed by his ex-girlfriend Ms Reynolds and her supporters on Wednesday as he left a court appearance over an alleged assault.

As DiPietro walked out of the Maine 
courthouse with his lawyer, Ms Reynolds and a dozen supporters
ran after him down a street and through a parking garage.

He ducked into the Portland police station as the crowd surrounded, shouting abuse and  'Where's Ayla?'

Public attack: Trista Reynolds follows her ex Justin DiPietro on Wednesday to demand answers about what happened on the night their daughter Ayla disappeared in 2011

On leaving the police station, DiPietro looked away from the mob and stayed composed until he eventually took off running. Reynolds and others gave chase before giving up.

On Wednesday, DiPietro 
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four days in jail for violating 
conditions of his release following his July arrest for 
allegedly assaulting an ex in Portland.

Prosecutors dropped the assault charge itself, telling the judge that the former girlfriend was uncooperative.

Ayla Reynolds disappeared in December 2011 from the Waterville, Maine home where DiPietro, who had custody of her, was living with his mother.

Her body has not been found and she is presumed dead. Investigators have said they suspect foul play and that DiPietro and others in the house the night before she was reported missing haven't been totally forthcoming.

In hopes of pressuring prosecutors to bring charges against DiPietro, Trista Reynolds for the past two weeks has been releasing details she says police told her about Ayla's blood being found in multiple spots inside the DiPietro home.

DiPietro has said he has no idea what happened to his daughter or who is responsible. He declined to comment on Wednesday outside the courthouse.

Earlier this week, Trista Reynolds 
released new details from evidence photographs taken in the wake of her 
daughter's disappearance where she claims blood was spattered on a car 
seat and baby doll.

In a
statement posted online on Monday, Reynolds provided previously 
unreleased details she said police investigators told her about her 
daughter's case. Reynolds says she wants the public to appeal to the 
state attorney general's office to file charges against DiPietro.

Ms Reynolds said in January this year, Maine State Police showed her a slideshow of evidence pictures of blood in different locations at her ex-boyfriend's home.

In a statement posted to websites JusticeForAyla and United4Ayla on Monday, Ms Reynolds claims that Ayla’s blood was found in several rooms inside the house, on the sofa and on the little girl's car seat in DiPietro’s vehicle.

According to Ms Reynolds, droplets were also found on Ayla's princess slippers and smeared across the face of a baby doll she played with. The mother said it looked as if her daughter had tried to wipe away the blood.

Blood was also found on DiPietro's sneakers, according to the statement and on the mattress and sheets in the father's basement bedroom.

Ms Reynolds also alleged that police showed her pictures of blood splashes on the floor and walls.

Fighting for the truth: Trista Reynolds cradles her one-month-old son Anthony as she discusses the disappearance of her daughter Ayla two years ago

She told BangorDailyNews.com last
week: 'After seeing [the evidence], it has started to settle in my mind
that Ayla more than likely really is deceased and not coming back. I’m 
not just able to close my eyes and not see her blood.'

Copies of the photographs or other evidence were not given to Ms Reynolds.

Maine Deputy Attorney General Bill Stokes says decisions on whether to file charges are based on evidence, not public pressure.

Miss Reynolds also has two sons. She gave birth to Anthony last month and has a two-year-old son Raymond.

By
revealing details of alleged evidence, Ms Reynolds intends to put pressure on the three people
who were at the home when Ayla disappeared on December 17 - her 
ex-boyfriend Justin, his sister Elisha and Justin's girlfriend Courtney Roberts. 

No one has ever been charged in the case. Justin DiPietro told police that his daughter disappeared during the night.

Miss Reynolds was attending a ten-day rehab program at the time her daughter disappeared.

The mother also claims that police have failed to keep her up-to-date on developments in her daughter's case.

She
said that she doesn't know if releasing new information will be 
detrimental to the case, she told BDN, but she wants to move things 
forward.

Maine investigators confirmed that they met with Ms Reynolds in January 2013 but re-iterated that they have 'no reaction' to her decision to speak publicly.

The news of the bloodstains last weekend came several days after DiPietro's arrest for violating the conditions of his bail for a
different charge. 

DiPietro was charged with the domestic
violence assault of his ex-girlfriend Courtney Roberts in July and one 
of his bail conditions was that he not use or possess alcohol.

Earlier this month he was stopped by traffic police due to his car's expired 
inspection sticker. The officer discovered alcohol in the car and he was
brought in.

he put her to bed. He said she was wearing green 
pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them

Father and daughter: Ayla's blood was found in the partially finished basement that DiPietro used as his bedroom

Ms Reynolds says that police showed her pictures of her daughter's blood that was found in DiPietro's basement, room, and truck.

A sample of the blood showed that the toddler's saliva was mixed with it, leading Ms Reynolds to believe that she suffered. 

Police have not arrested DiPietro 
because there is no evidence to prove that he was the one who killed his
daughter but they have said that they do not think it is reasonable to
believe that she is still alive.

Di Pietro has maintained his innocence.
