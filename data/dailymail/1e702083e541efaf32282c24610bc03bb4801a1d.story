He's hosting a new TV game show, is the new face of ITV's rugby coverage and is perched in a taxi on the way to the airport as he chats to MailOnline. Gethin Jones is not an easy man to pin down.

But one place where you might have more luck is Tinder, after the 36-year-old Welsh star confessed that he was thinking of going digital in a bid to find love in an interview.

'We were joking about it,' he says of the off-the-cuff quip. 'I actually think Tinder will become the next new Saturday night TV phenomenon.'

Busy man: Gethin is currently compering ITV's new daytime game show, The 21st Question

No love: Despite his dark good looks, Gethin has been single since splitting from Katherine Jenkins

While he's loath to reveal exactly what his profile might say, the presenter is happy to open up about his single status which he puts down to his inability to 'find the right one'.

But when he does, he won't have any problems striking up a conversation. 'What's the worst that can happen if 
you're polite in the way you go about it?' chuckles the 5ft 11" former rugby player.

'Although I did get nervous 
talking to Anthea Turner the other day.'

Nervous though the veteran presenter might have made him, Jones says her ultra-groomed and glamorous style isn't the be-all and end-all when it comes to finding the perfect woman.

'I like a girl who's comfortable in her own skin,' he says after a moment's thought. 'Someone who can make light of a situation.

'Most importantly, I like a girl who can laugh. Not in a comedy stand up routine kind of way but who just likes laughing in general.'

One person who's doing a lot of laughing at the moment is Jones himself, who is currently riding a wave of career success that includes new game show The 21st Question and a meatier role as the face of ITV's rugby coverage.

'I've loved making the show,' he says of the quiz, which sees him cast in the role of comp√®re as contestants battle it out to be asked the eponymous 21st question and go home with a cash prize.

'I know the team really well so I've been involved on the production side from the early stages. That way I've really been able to take ownership, which is really important with a show like this.'

Although the ITV show is on every day, Jones says the entire series was filmed over the course of one gruelling week, although in true cheeky chappy style, he confesses to enjoying every moment.

Enjoying himself: Gethin says filming The 21st Question was gruelling but reveals that he enjoyed every minute

Hard work: Along with his starring role in The 21st Question, Jones is the new face of ITV's rugby coverage

'Yes they were long days but they certainly didn't feel like that because they were a lot of fun,' he explains.

'I think being in good physical shape and eating well can really help keep you mentally sharp for that kind of job.'

Getting it right, particularly in a format that has been revamped and remade thousands of times, also proved a challenge, although Jones says he's pleased with the result.

'I'm a big fan of quiz shows,' he insists. 'I've 
watched quite a few and learned a lot from the best in the business 
host-wise.

'I think the key element in a show like The 21st Question is 
being able to change gear - to be able to enjoy it, have fun with 
the contestants but also know when to build the drama.

'Based on the 
stats from last week, the audience has increased throughout the show, which hopefully means that it's working.'

It's certainly a new departure for Jones, whose career began on the drama-free Blue Peter and has since gone on to encompass everything from the sublime (Britain's Secret Treasures) to the panned (Daybreak).

Still single: Although Gethin has been linked to several ladies, including Susie Amy (left), he says he is single

Nevertheless, he says that ups and downs notwithstanding, presenting remains his 'dream job' and one that allows him to use his profile for good, even if it means travelling to some less than lovely corners of the world.

'I feel overwhelmingly blessed and lucky to have been doing it for 
12 years,' he beams. 'It's a privilege to be able to use my profile to help others
 and I genuinely can't remember a bad day at the office.

'I've been out to Afghanistan for the 
past three years in a row filming Remembrance Week for the BBC,' he adds.

'Telling the extraordinary, brave and courageous stories of our 
armed forces, past and present gives me great pleasure.'

With the war in Afghanistan finally drawing to a close, it's unlikely he'll be filming too many more Remembrance Weeks.

But that doesn't mean he has no more big ambitions, although fulfilling one of them means getting more closely involved with a certain dating app.

'Being a TV presenter is quite an 
uncertain profession,' he admits, 'so in 10 years time, I hope the companies I'm involved with will have matured and 
developed.

'I hope I'm still doing what I love doing, which is making and
 hosting TV shows, and,' he pauses to allow himself a grin, 'I hope to have a wife and a few little ones 
around to share it with.'

Singletons, if you aren't on Tinder already, now might be a good time to sign up.
