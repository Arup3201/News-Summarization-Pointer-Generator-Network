Model Cara Delevingne has been unveiled as the new face of British fashion brand, Topshop

The fashion gems Cara can be seen modeling include a fur-trimmed Martha parka (£98), animal print skirt, biker jacket, thigh-high boots, chiffon shirt and statement sequin and feather cocktail dress.

Unfortunately for consumers round the world, the boho hair, sexy brows and perfect pout are the model’s own.

Previous Topshop campaigns have featured Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Lily Donaldson, Rosie Tapner and Eliza Cummings in the early stages of their careers. Best friends Jourdan Dunn and Karlie Kloss also met on a Topshop campaign shoot.

Topshop's creative director Kate Phelan said: 'Cara is a true Topshop girl. Her style is confident and playful.'

Cara’s first appearance for Topshop was in 2010 when she featured in a campaign video alongside Kate Moss and the 21-year-old has strutted her stuff down the Topshop catwalk many times since.

Topshop and Cara also made history together at London Fashion Week when the model live-streamed from the runway by carrying a Google-cam
concealed in her handbag.

She also had a YouTube moment backstage at Topshop Autumn/Winter 2013 catwalk show when a clip of her performing the Harlem Shake went viral. It's now had over 1.6 million views on YouTube.

With her 1.75 million Twitter following, it's no wonder Topshop boss Sir Philip Green is glad to have her on board.

'At such an ambitious and exciting time for our many thousands of staff and loyal customers, it is fitting to have a fabulous, young British star such as Cara at the epicentre of our campaign,' he says referring to the brand's new global plans.

In the US five new
 stores will be opening including a new flagship on 5th Avenue, which 
after the iconic 100,000sq ft. Oxford Circus store in London will be 
the second largest store in the world.

The mega-brand is also opening a store in Amsterdam, two further
 stores in Hong Kong and new stores in Egypt, New Zealand and 
Panama.

'I am hopeful and confident that this will be the beginning of another strong relationship for Topshop,' says Sir Phillip.

'I believe that these plans demonstrate our commitment both in the UK and globally for the Topshop and Topman brands, with one of our biggest years of expansion to date,' he adds.The campaign is shot in London by renowned photographer Alasdair McLellan and styled by Topshop's creative director Kate Phelan.

'Cara is a true Topshop girl,' says Kate. 'Her style is confident and playful and she can be sophisticated and chic as easily as she can be cool and casual. 

'Putting her spin on everything she makes the Topshop collection her own. Her uninhibited natural energy is intoxicating, she is free-spirited and fun.'

The Autumn/Winter collection lands in stores and online from August and the brand described the items in the collection as 'hero pieces with go-anywhere appeal'.
