There are few things Britons take greater pride in than a well-trimmed swathe of lustrous lawn.

But caring for your treasured turf could be about to become much more expensive – thanks to a ruling from (you guessed it) Europe.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has been warned that Brussels may soon require anyone using a ride-on mower to take out motor insurance – even if they never take it near a road.

Insurance experts have predicted the move would cost gardeners at least £100 a year in extra premiums – and potentially much more.

Sources close to Mr McLoughlin said he was determined to fight off any such ‘bureaucratic meddling’.

Under current rules, gardeners using ride-on mowers on their property – and not on the highway – are normally insured for any accidents through their home insurance policies. 

But Department for Transport officials are worried that a ruling due next month at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg could change all that.

Bizarrely, the case has nothing to do with Britain but revolves around a Slovenian man who was injured in a farm accident when he was knocked off a ladder by a trailer attached to a tractor.

Tim Price, rural affairs spokesman for insurance firm NFU Mutual, said changing the rules would mean more expense for homeowners. He added: ‘It would be likely to cost at least £100 extra a year to take out a separate motor policy, and that would be for a small mower at that.’

Last night, a source close to Mr McLoughlin made it clear he would fight any new Brussels ruling on the issue.

The source said: ‘This is exactly the sort of bureaucratic EU meddling that drives people mad. We’re determined to fight it off. It simply isn’t necessary and could hit Brits in their pockets.’
