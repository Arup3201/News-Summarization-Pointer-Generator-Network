A woman whose ex-boyfriend is on trial for raping and murdering a student claimed in a video shown to the court that she sat on the victim's face for up to 15 minutes during bondage play - in what has come as a shocking twist in the already sordid case.

The chilling video, which was filmed by public defenders days after her then-boyfriend Seth Mazzaglia was arrested, throws doubt on claims made by the prosecutions' key witness Kathryn McDonough, who previously told the court that she had not had any sexual involvement with Lizzi Marriott.

Mazzaglia's defense team just needs to convince one juror in the Dover, New Hampshire courtroom that McDonough, 20, is lying to spare him a first-degree murder conviction.

In the video, which was filmed on October 17, 2012, McDonough tells public defender Joachim Barth that she sat on 19-year-old Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott's face during bondage sex for '10 to 15 minutes'.

Twist: Kathryn McDonough can be seen speaking on a 2012 video, claiming she was involved in bondage play with Elizabeth Marriott before she died. Her ex-boyfriend, Seth Mazzaglia, is seen front

At one point in the footage, McDonough, who has portrayed herself as her ex-boyfriend's sex slave, even acts out exactly how she squatted over the young woman.

She also discusses her interest in bondage and how she used a rope to restrain the young woman on the floor of Mazzaglia's apartment after luring there on the promise of watching a movie.

As jurors stayed riveted to the footage, McDonough's eyes darted nervously from the video to Barth, who has repeatedly accused her of lying in court, the Boston Herald reported.

After speaking in the video, McDonough later changed her story to say Mazzaglia strangled Marriott with a bondage rope and then raped her limp body as McDonough looked on, horrified.

And during
 the trial, she has denied having any sexual involvement with Marriott on
 the night she died and claimed she initially lied to the public 
defender to protect 
Mazzaglia.

When
 quizzed on her inconsistencies between the previous story and her 
testimony in court, McDonough insisted the story on video was 'a very 
big lie'.

Barth asked if she was now telling the truth.

She replied saying: 'Itâ€™s just me trying to tell the truth as best I can.'

The
 case relies heavily on McDonough's testimony, meaning that if jurors do
 not find her credible, Mazzaglia could walk away from the trial without
 serving time. He has pleaded not guilty.

McDonough is currently serving three 
years in prison for lying to cops and witness tampering.

The
 two-week trial has been filled with sordid testimony from McDonough, 
who said she has brought Marriott, whom she worked with at a mall, to 
her boyfriend's home as a sex offering. She claimed he had demanded she 
bring someone over as punishment for leaving him alone while she went to
 camp.

On Wednesday,
 Strafford County Superior Court also heard that McDonough witnessed 
Mazzaglia strangle Marriot but didn't get help or call the 
authorities because she was scared of her boyfriend.

Loss: Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott was raped 
and strangled in October 2012, but her body has never been found

Barth,
 who is representing Mazzaglia, told the court: 'Your instincts for 
survival did not prompt you to scream out the open window as you stood 
in front of it ... Your instincts for survival did not prompt you to try
 to get the attention of neighbors directly across the river.'

Earlier
 in the trial, McDonough denied she was controlled by multiple 
personalities after Mr Barth said she had five 
voices in her head.

He
 told the court McDonough was secretly recorded telling a friend that 
the night Miss Marriott died one of the personas took control and 
McDonough blacked out.

But on cross-examination, she disputed that her reference was to the night Marriott died.

Questions: Defense attorney Bartha holds up a picture of the crime scene. He quizzed McDonough yesterday about whether she had been lying in her earlier video - and she said she had been

Doubts: McDonough, pictured on the stand on Wednesday, said she had previously lied to protect her then-boyfriend - but the inconsistencies throw doubt on the prosecution's key witness

Miss Marriott had transferred to the University of New Hampshire only weeks earlier to major in marine biology.

She had been in a committed relationship with Brittany Atwood, who lived in Massachusetts.

On
 the night she died, Miss Marriot text messaged Miss Atwood minutes 
before 9pm to let her know she was going over to 'Kat's' to watch a 
movie.

Atwood testified she was happy for her because she was finally making new friends.

The text message was Marriott's last communication.

Her
 body has never been found and prosecutors believe Mazzaglia and 
McDonough put it inside the victim's car then dumped it in a river.
