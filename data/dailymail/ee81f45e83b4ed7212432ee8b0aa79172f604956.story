A baby hippo who won Britain's hearts when he appeared on Paul O’Grady’s Animal Orphans has been successfully released back into the wild.

Douglas the hippo was just two weeks when he was found abandoned and close to death in the Zambian wild in May 2013.

Now, more than a year later, he has joined a pod of wild hippo in the South Luangwa River, close to the wildlife center where he has grown up.

Douglas appeared on the ITV show making friends with terriers Molly and Coco as he started an ambitious rehabilitation programme at the Chipembele Wildlife Education Trust (CWET).

Thanks to his undeniable charms, supporters ‘adopted’ Douglas and have donated over £10,000 to his rehabilitation and release.

CWET founders Anna and Steve Tolan, have over 16 years of experience rearing orphaned animals and returning them to the wild – but this was the first time they had taken in a hippo.

‘We constructed a pool and brought in dedicated carers to look after Douglas who initially was bottle fed and looked to his human carers for reassurance and companionship and even swimming lessons,’ Mr Tolan said.

‘Douglas has now been fending for himself since he was weaned in January and is surviving and thriving.' 

‘He has made his first few attempts to join the wild pod in the Luangwa River. It will probably be a long, slow process until he is fully accepted into the pod but he is on his way.’

Will Travers, President of the Born Free Foundation, which supports CWET, said of the rescue mission: ‘I’m so pleased to be able to say ‘Mission Accomplished’ for Douglas.

'Born Free believes that the individual animal matters – every wild animal deserves a life worth living and to be free.And today, thanks to the work of our dedicated partners on the ground in Zambia, we know there is one happy wild hippo living free again.’

Bringing up the rear: Although he was just weeks old at the time, it took six men to carry Douglas out of the plane when he arrived at the wildlife centre

‘We knew Anna, Steve and their team 
would work tirelessly to raise Douglas and give him the chance of a life
 back in the wild.

'Their ethos and dedication to the welfare of 
individual wild animals perfectly reflects Born Free and our mission.’
