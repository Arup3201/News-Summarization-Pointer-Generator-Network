Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton was presented with the 2014 drivers' championship trophy at the FIA's annual awards ceremony in Qatar.

Hamilton clinched the championship at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi last month, pipping Mercedes team-mate to the title in what was billed as the 'Duel in the Desert'.

And on Friday night champions from every branch of international motor sport gathered at the 2014 prize-giving ceremony as Hamilton finally got his hands on the trophy.

Hamilton endured a frosty relationship with team-mate Rosberg for much of the season, culminating in the pair colliding at the Belgian grand prix - leading to disciplinary action against the German by Mercedes.

But the duo looked to have put their differences aside following the season's climax as they posed for pictures together during the event.

Rosberg took to Twitter to share a selfie with champion Hamilton, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff and Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo.
