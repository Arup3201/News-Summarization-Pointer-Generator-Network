He's a symbol of Arsenal and Wales and now Aaron Ramsey is doing his part for grassroots football too.

The talented midfielder was at Wembley on Monday as McDonald's UK football ambassador after they announced its long-term commitment to improving the standard of grassroots football with the renewal of its partnership with the home football associations.

The new four-year programme will focus on supporting accredited grassroots clubs and their volunteers to raise the standards of football across the UK and improving the experience for young aspiring footballers.

As part of the new programme McDonald’s will be giving over 7,000 accredited clubs with a junior team, the opportunity to order a brand new strip every year for the next four seasons with the potential for over 250,000 kits to be distributed to clubs across the UK.

Ramsey was at the home of English football with local grassroots club Larkspur Rovers as the launch of this news broke.

Afterwards the 23-year-old expressed his delight at being part of the scheme.

'I am really excited about being a part of the new McDonald’s football programme,' he said.

'It was a lot of fun launching the kit scheme today with Larkspur Rovers, one of the many fantastic FA Charter Standard clubs which operate across the UK.

'Grassroots clubs and their volunteers offer an incredible amount of time to providing local communities with footballing opportunities and it is so important that we support them in as many ways as possible to help them raise the standards of football that they offer.'
