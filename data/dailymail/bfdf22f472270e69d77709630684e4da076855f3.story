Is Tom Daley due to retire? Reports say the British diver, pictured with his Olympic bronze medal, will quit the sport after this month's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow

British diver Tom Daley is reportedly set to retire from the sport after the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.

Sources close to the 20-year-old star say he will quit diving this year amid fears he will not win a medal at the next Olympics.

An ongoing struggle with a 'phobia' of his back twist dive - for which he was receiving therapy - is also said to be behind the decision.

But a spokesman for the diver denied the claims, saying Daley's 'goal' was to compete at Rio 2016.

The source reportedly said: 'Sadly Tom has decided he’ll retire after the Commonwealth Games to avoid Rio.

'He’s
 pretty much got no chance of medalling at the Olympics. If he can 
retain gold at the Commonwealth Games then he’ll out on a high.

'His
 struggle with his back twist has been well documented and he knows the 
time will be right.

'He’s had a great career in diving and has so many 
other opportunities.'

Earlier this year, the two-time Commonwealth champion revealed he was having therapy to try to eradicate the issue with the 'terrifying' back twist dive.

The source says his self-confessed 'phobia' of the dive means he will find it hard to win bronze, silver or gold at Rio.

This, coupled with the long training regime needed to qualify for an Olympic Games, means he has decided to retire following the Glasgow event, it is claimed.

A source said Daley's current form, as well as a 'phobia' of a back twist dive, for which he was having therapy, has led to the decision. A spokesman has denied the claims, saying Daley plans to compete in Rio 2016

A spokesman for the athlete denied the claims of early retirement, adding: 'Tom’s working hard in training and his goal remains to compete in his third Olympic Games, at Rio 2016.'

In the wake of the reports, Daley also tweeted his 2.6m followers saying: 'Back into training! #SeeYouInGlasgow and RIO ;)'.

After roaring success in junior championships, the diver won his place in Team GB at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. He later won a bronze medal at the London Olympics in 2012.

After finishing sixth in last summer's World Championships, Daley left his long-term base in Plymouth and his coach Andy Banks to train at the London Aquatics Centre through to the Rio Olympics.

In April this year, Daley missed out on a medal at the Diving World Series after finishing fifth in the final of the 10-metre platform.

Despite an otherwise successful performance, the back twist dive - a two-and-a-half somersault with a two-and-a-half twist - proved difficult for the diver.

It is the same one which he had to repeat at the 2012 Olympics after an unexpected camera flash from the crowd.

After that, the diver admitted he was desperately seeking help over his fear of the dive and that the scale of the issue was 'massive'.

He said: 'It is almost trauma therapy - to get myself to process the things that have gone wrong on it to get it to a stage where I can forget about it and feel positive about it.

'I am literally terrified of it. I suppose you could call it a phobia and I don't know what my heart rate is when I go up there and do it but it's definitely above 180, something ridiculous, because it is so terrifying.'

Daley will compete in the 10m Platform on August 2 at the Commonwealth Games, which is due to start tomorrow.

He is scheduled to do his pre-games 
media conferences on Thursday before the diving competition gets underway in Edinburgh on July 30.

Meanwhile, the diver returned to England yesterday after being unexpectedly grounded in Russia.

Daley was returning from an event in Shanghai ahead of the Commonwealth Games when he and his partner Dustin Lance Black were among 301 people who were forced to land in the Siberian city of Irkutsk.

Their Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340 had a 'technical issue' which Daley made known when he tweeted about it to his 2.5 million followers.
