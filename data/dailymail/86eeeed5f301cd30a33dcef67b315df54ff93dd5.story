When it came to finding a soulmate one woman from New York was prepared to pay big bucks to find 'the one'.

So imagine the shock and despair Audrey Ruden faced when after paying a matchmaker to do Cupid's work, she only met men who wanted one-night stands, instead of something a little more permanent.

Now the top Manhattan  broker who has sold more than $500 million dollars of Manhattan real estate, wants her money back and she's prepared to fight for it.

Suing Cupid: Audrey Ruden is suing Richard Easton after he failed to find her soul mate

Ms Ruden, who has been married before and is now 61, filed a lawsuit in Manhattan civil court Thursday saying Richard Easton, who runs a matchmaking service, is a fraud.

Mr Easton, who has appeared on Real Housewives​ of New York​, offers 'personalized, sophisticated, thoughtful matchmaking services provided by h​​ighly trained experts.'  

Ms Ruden, who is a top broker for Douglas Elliman, claims that Mr Easton's claims are 'a lie'. 

Instead, she claims, her six-figure fee saw her sent off on two dates with bachelors who only had an interest in short-term flings.

 Promises: Easton said that 'Ms. Ruden is a lovely woman for whom we wish to make happy in love'

Frustrated: Audrey Ruden says she asked for her money back but that RIchard Easton was 'unresponsive' and never returned her voicemails

One of the dates even questioned 'why she was pursuing marriage,' the suit says.

The legal papers go onto claim that Ms​ Ruden realized Mr Easton 'had taken advantage of her intense desire to be in a committed relationship' and demanded her money back, but he refused, according to the New York Post. 

She alleges that the $100,000 fee also ​violates the state's Dating Services Law preventing 'purveyors of social referral services' from charging above $1,000 per client. 

Under New York state law, any dating service charging more than $25 must provide a minimum number of referrals per month.

If the service does not deliver for two successive months, the client is entitled to cancel the contract with a full refund minus a cancellation fee.

She even accuses the 'international playboy' of hiring men to 'create a false impression of performing the contracted-for services.'

Easton told The Post, 'Ms. Ruden is a lovely woman for whom we wish to make happy in love', but he said, she has a 'strict criteria' and turned down two 'wonderful, handsome, and very successful men.'

It's not the only lawsuit on Mr. Easton's plate. 

Earlier this month, his landlord sued him for a host of offenses, including commanding the building's employees to call him 'Prince,' ordering that a maid give him oral sex and letting his dog relieve himself on his West Village Perry Street building's rooftop deck.
