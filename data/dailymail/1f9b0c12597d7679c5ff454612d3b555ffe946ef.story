Guilty: John Thompson (pictured) was imprisoned yesterday after blaming a seven-year-old girl for seducing him

A vile paedophile who blamed a girl of seven for seducing him was finally locked up yesterday - weeks after a judge let him walk free.

John Thompson escaped a prison sentence in July despite pleading guilty to sexually assaulting his victim.

Incredibly, he accused the schoolgirl of pinning him down on a bed after ‘flirting’ with him.

Thompson narrowly avoided jail and was instead ordered to undergo a sex offender treatment programme.

The lenient sentence imposed by Judge Gillian Matthews QC sparked fury among child protection charities who branded it ‘despicable’.

Despite his remarkable let-off, Thompson was back in the dock last month for failing to comply with the same order - and yet again was given a second chance to change his ‘appalling attitude’.

Now, having again failed to attend the sex offender treatment programme, he has been sent to prison.

In a laughable attempt to avoid jail, he claimed he had missed one appointment with his probation worker because of a build-up of wax in his ears.

Even when the retired brewery worker did show up to see his probation worker he was ‘hostile and uncooperative’, the court heard.

Thompson remained adamant that the girl was a liar, demanded that she be punished and threatened to sue her for making the allegations, the hearing was told.

Jailing Judge Gillian Matthews, QC, told him: ‘The only reason that I passed a suspended sentence was for you to take part in the sex offenders’ treatment programme.

‘Your views, in my judgement, are entrenched and dogmatic. You will not comply or co-operate. You will not accept your responsibility for this offence.’

Thompson, of Hartlepool, Cleveland, was jailed for eight months and had the supervision order against him revoked at Teesside Crown Court.

His barrister, Lorraine Mustard, said: ‘It would appear that while he has tried to alter his attitude towards the offending, he has been unable to.’

Thompson first dodged jail in the summer after insisting he was unable to fight off the girl as she pinned him to a bed and forced her tongue into his mouth.

Child protection charities were furious with the sentence imposed. They claimed an eight-month jail term, suspended for two years, was far too lenient.

They described it as ‘outrageous’ and ‘unacceptable’ and claimed Thompson was ‘clearly a danger to society, and particularly to children’.

Within a month, Thompson failed to turn up at a meeting with a probation worker - citing wax in his ears. He missed another meeting because ‘a window of his home was broken’.

Nigel Soppitt, prosecuting, said officials from the Probation Service now considered the sex offenders order to be ‘completely unworkable’ because of Thompson’s terrible attitude.

'It is a culmination of these factors - the breaches, his attitude - that renders this order completely unworkable from their point of view,’ said Mr Soppitt.

‘This has to be viewed against a background of him feeling the sentence was unfair, calling the victim a liar and calling for her to be punished.

‘It worsened. He said he had been set up by his legal team and without DNA he should not have pleaded guilty.’

Judge Matthews dismissed his complaints about his lawyers and insisted that it and his desire to take legal action against the girl were ‘all classic traits of a paedophile’.

Thompson’s barrister, Lorraine Mustard, said: ‘It would appear that while he has tried to alter his attitude towards the offending, he has been unable to.’

‘It is quite clear that a build-up of wax in his ear was, perhaps, not the most convincing reason for failing to attend.’

‘While there has been some change in his approach, the probation officer is quite clear that his views are entrenched and he remains dogmatic in the assertions he has made on more than one occasion.’

Thompson was placed on the sex offenders’ register and banned from having unsupervised contact with girls under 16.
