An elderly woman turned herself into authorities after she said she realized that she struck and killed a six-year-old boy, authorities said.

Veramae C. Phillip, 83, told authorities that on September 8, she was driving along Franklinville Road in Woodstock, Illinois in the dark and the rain when she thought a branch had fallen on her car.

But authorities said she had unknowingly hit and killed little Brayan Silva.

Confessed: Verame C. Phillips, 83, left, turned herself in after police issued a warrant for her arrest; she was charged with the death of 6-year-old Brayan Silva after she allegedly struck him with her car and fled the scene

Vehicle: Phillip was driving a 2001 silver Chevy Malibu; police found her after receiving a tip from an auto body shop

Not knowing that she had struck the boy with her 2001 silver Chevy Malibu, Phillip left the scene.

Brayan, who was at a family party, had been crossing the street with his father around 9pm that night, police said.

Phillip later told police that she thought she hit something, but was unsure of what it was, brushing it off as only a tree branch falling on her car.

According to her account, an elderly friend was riding in the vehicle with her.

Following the accident, police traced Phillip by taking in witness accounts. A body shop called the police saying that they saw a silver car with a damaged headlight.

Phillip had driven to a nearby hospital where she was being treated for a condition unrelated to the accident, Patch reported.

Meanwhile, the boy was taken to Centrega Hospital in Woodstock, but was pronounced dead on arrival, according to sheriff’s reports.

Phillip turned herself in on Thursday after authorities after they issued a warrant for her arrest, and was charged with felony counts of leaving the scene of a fatal crash, as well as failure to report a fatal traffic accident.

According to the McHenry County Sheriff’s Office, she was released after paying $5,000 of a $50,000 bond.

The 83-year-old woman  is extremely upset over the boy’s death, and has cooperated completely with authorities. McHenry County Undersheriff Andrew Zinke told the Daily Herald: ‘She is very distraught over it.’

He added: ‘This is a terrible tragedy for everyone involved.’

Authorities do not believe that alcohol or drugs played a role in the fatal accident, and added that Phillip did not have a criminal record. 

According to his obituary, Brayan enjoying playing soccer, riding his bicycle, and being with his friends and family.

His funeral mass was held at St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Plano on Saturday. 

There have been more than 680 fatalities this year alone on Illinois roadways, the Illinois Department of Transportation said.
