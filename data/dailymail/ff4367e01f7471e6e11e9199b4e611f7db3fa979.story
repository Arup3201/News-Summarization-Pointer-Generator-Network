To celebrate the delivery of the new Airbus A350s to commercial airline companies, five of the planes took to the sky for a spectacular formation flight.

Manoeuvring more like fighter jets, the Airbus' performed a diamond formation, a low pass, an echelon formation and finally the arrow in the skies above Toulouse, France.

After meticulous planning, run-throughs with pilots and ground staff, and many question and answer sessions, the planes put on a memorable display.

Airbus, whose aircraft's wings are made in the UK, has delivered the first of its new generation of wide-bodied planes.

Powered by Rolls-Royce engines, the Airbus A350 XWB (extra wide-bodied) was handed over first to Middle East carrier Qatar Airways.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'This is a really significant day for Airbus whose talented staff should feel proud. With the wings and the engines designed and built in Broughton, Filton (both Airbus factories) and Derby (Rolls-Royce), this aircraft shows that Britain is leading the world in the leaner, greener aircraft of the future.

'The Government is committed to backing our world-beating aerospace sector through our industrial strategy, which is why we are investing £2 billion jointly with industry over seven years in research and design into the next generation of aircraft.'

Airbus boasts that the A350, which has carbon fibre fuselage and wings, sets 'new standards in terms of passenger comfort, operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness'.

The formation flight was hugely impressive, thanks to the meticulous planning by all concerned

Rolls-Royce chief executive John Rishton said: 'This is a very important day for everyone at Rolls-Royce.'

Airbus president and chief executive Fabrice Bregier said the new plane was 'revolutionising our industry and redefining the way people fly'.
