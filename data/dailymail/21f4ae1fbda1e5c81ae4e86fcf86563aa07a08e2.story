Head coach Alan Irvine has warned West Brom they must be prepared to face Daniel Sturridge - despite the striker being left out of the England squad.

The Liverpool forward was omitted by Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson for their Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia after a plea from Anfield chief Brendan Rodgers.

Sturridge has not played for the Reds since August after suffering a groin problem and was left at home for their 1-0 Champions League defeat at Basel on Wednesday.

But Irvine feels the 25-year-old will be fit enough to play a part as the Baggies look to add to the frustration around Anfield.

He told a press conference: 'Obviously he wasn't able to go and play for Liverpool, in a very important game in the Champions League, but I think he'll be close.

'I wouldn't be surprised if he turned up on the team-sheet, either starting or as a substitute.'

The Baggies are chasing a fourth straight win in all competitions after their 4-0 victory over Burnley on Sunday.

They go to Merseyside a point ahead of a stuttering Liverpool team, who are winless in their last three Barclays Premier League games.

Albion are without strikers Brown Ideye (ankle) and Victor Anichebe (groin) and winger Silvestre Varela (hernia) but Irvine said the Baggies believe in themselves.

'They are a very, very good team, they have got some top players without a doubt, he added.

'It will be extremely difficult to go there and win - but we can and we will go there feeling that we can. We went to Tottenham believing we could win. We really did, we didn't go negatively.

'We went to White Hart Lane with two strikers. If we had gone there believing we couldn't win we would have gone with five midfield players but we went with two strikers.

'I think that was borne out by the way the lads performed. We went into the game against Burnley with a different plan, but with the same kind of belief.

'We will go to Anfield knowing it's a really difficult place to go. But can we win there? Absolutely, of course we can.'
