A Nazi-war criminal accused of complicity in the killings of 15,700 Jews has been tracked down.

The Simon Wiesenthal Centre, which compiles a list of the most-wanted suspects from the Second World War, confirmed that Laszlo Csatary was identified in the Hungarian capital, Budapest.

The 97-year-old was a police commander in charge of a 
Jewish ghetto in Kassa, Hungary, during the war, from where thousands were sent to their deaths at Auschwitz.

Activists protest against Csatary after a Hungarian prosecutor said that investigating an aged Nazi war criminal found alive and well in Budapest was problematic because the events took place so long ago and in a different country

evidence to the Budapest prosecutor's office

Ten months ago an informer, who was 
paid $25,000 for the tip-off, had provided information that allowed the 
Simon Wiesenthal Centre to
locate Csatary, 97, in Budapest.

In September last year, they had passed on their information to the
prosecutor's office in the Hungarian capital.

A statement released on Sunday by Efraim Zuroff, the 
director of the centre dedicated to hunting down Nazi-war criminals, 
said it had submitted new evidence regarding crimes committed
during World War II by its 'Number One Most Wanted suspect' Laszlo 
Csatary.

The centre said the evidence related to Csatary's key role in the
deportation of approximately 300 Jews from Kosice
to Kamenetz-Podolsk, Ukraine, where almost all were murdered in the summer of
1941.

Budapest's assistant prosecutor general, Jeno Varga, said: 'An
investigation is under way. The prosecutor's office will study the information
received.'

But Zuroff said in the Centre's statement: 'This new evidence
strengthens the already very strong case against Csatary and reinforces our
insistence that he be held accountable for his crimes.

'The passage of time in no way diminishes his guilt and old age should
not afford protection for Holocaust perpetrators.'

Zuroff told AFP that the The Sun had photographed and filmed Csatary, having
acted on the information that the Wiesenthal Centre had released last
September.

When its reporters confronted him on his doorstep, he had denied any crimes
and slammed the door in their faces, the paper reported.

Participants of a demonstration called by the European Union of Jewish Students protested in front of Laszlo Csatary's hideaway building in Budapest today.

The demonstration was called after a Hungarian prosecutor said that investigating an aged Nazi war criminal found alive and well in Budapest was problematic because the events took place so long ago and in a different country.

The Wiesenthal Centre has urged Hungarian
prosecutors to put Csatary on trial.

They say he served during World War II as a senior Hungarian police officer
in the Slovakian city of Kosice, then under Hungarian rule.

Hell: Millions lost their lives at Auschwitz Concentration Camp, where Laszlo Csatary is accused of being complicit in deporting 15,700 to their deaths

Csatary, the former police commander of the Jewish ghetto in Kassa, Hungary, is accused of complicity in transporting thousands to their deaths

He was complicit in the deportations of thousands of Jews from Kosice and the surrounding area to the Auschwitz death camp in the spring of 1944.

According to evidence, Csatary had treated the Jews in the ghetto with cruelty, whipping women and
forcing them to dig holes with their bare hands.

In 1948, a Czech court condemned him to death after a trial held in his
absence.

He had fled to Canada and had worked as an art dealer using a false
identity, before being unmasked in 1995 and forced to flee.

Laszlo Csatary, who the Simon Wiesenthal Centre says has been found in Hungary, is number one on the group's list of Nazi war criminals known to be still alive and at large almost seven decades after World War II.

Csatary, who is now 97, is listed by the Vienna-based Nazi-hunters as having 'helped organise the deportation to Auschwitz of approximately 15,700 Jews' from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in early 1944.

The top two names - Alois Brunner and Aribert Heim - are widely suspected to be dead.The following are the five top remaining names on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's list:

1: Laszlo CsataryServed as a Hungarian police chief in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. Accused of being instrumental in sending thousands to death camps.

2: Gerhard SommerA former German SS officer who was involved in the massacre of 560 civilians in August, 1944 in Italy.

3: Vladimir Katriuk Served in a Ukrainian battalion which murdered Jews and other civilians in Belarus during the war.

4: Karoly ZentaiTook part in the persecution and murder of Jews in Budapest in 1944.

5: Soeren KamAn officer in an SS division during the war, he took part in the murder of an anti-Nazi newspaper publisher in Denmark.
