The man accused of murdering April Jones had viewed and downloaded Facebook photos of the five-year-old in the days before she disappeared, a jury heard today.

Mark Bridger, 47, had also amassed a 'library' of child porn on his lap top computer including cartoon images
of  'monster sex' depicting 'demonoid' creatures ravaging very young
girls.

The father-of-six had also stored photographs of victims in 
child sex murder cases including the Soham girls Holly Wells and Jessica
Chapman, murdered British teenager Caroline Dickinson and Jessica 
Lunsford who was murdered and buried alive in Florida.

Hi tech computer expert Mervyn Ray from Dyfed Powys police today told Mold Crown Court: 'The computer was found to contain a series of folders which 
amounted to a library of images.

'The folders were arranged in such a 
way so that in one part you had pornographic images.

'In one folder 
there were pornographic images including images of under age girls. In 
another there were images of sexual activity in cartoon format including
images of under age girls. In a third folder there were images of 
clothed girls including known individuals.'

Mr Ray told the jury that there was also a list of 
internet search terms used by Bridger which included 'naked five year 
old girls' and  'naked virgin teens.'

The jury also heard today that Bridger used a 
mobile internet dongle to search Facebook, MSN and Yahoo sites 
shortly over two hours before April was seen being driven away in his 
Land Rover car from near her home.

April, who had cerebral palsy, vanished while playing on her bike near her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, on October 1 last year.

April Jones

Bridger, 47, denies abducting and murdering the schoolgirl in a 'sexually motivated' attack.

At around 7.20am on September 22, nine days before April vanished, Mr Ray said Bridger viewed 22 Facebook photos of one of April’s half-sisters, among them were pictures which also showed April.

At about 7.30am he looked at nine images of another local girl and three minutes later looked at more pictures of April and a half-sister.

Mr Ray told the jury: 'When Mr Bridger is looking at Facebook, the site provides the computer with a brief record.'

Several pictures of April’s half-sister, including one with April, were saved to the computer and were shown to the jury.

On September 28, three days before April vanished, seven more images of her half-sister were viewed and 25 images of another local young girl.

On the day of April’s alleged abduction, Mr Ray said Bridger accessed Facebook on several occasions and viewed 32 images of local girls.

Just after midday, the witness said, Bridger also looked an indecent cartoon image which had been saved on to the computer.

That afternoon, he sent Facebook messages to three different women inviting them to go 'for a drink', the court heard.

Shortly before 5pm, a mobile internet dongle was used with the laptop.

The dongle was never recovered, the jury was told, and Mr Ray said it was not possible to establish what was being viewed on the laptop.

April was last seen at around 7pm on October 1, playing on a bicycle with her friend near their homes on Machynlleth’s Bryn-Y-Gog estate.

Her body has never been found despite the biggest search operation in British policing history.

The prosecution say Bridger, a former slaughterhouse worker, snatched and murdered the schoolgirl.

He says he accidentally killed her when he ran her over and accepts that he must have got rid of her body but cannot remember how he did it because he was drunk.

Earlier, the public gallery was cleared as the jury was shown some of the images found on Bridger’s laptop.

Mr Ray said there were a total of 100 to 150 indecent images on the computer, 65 of which he considered to be of a 'criminal standard'.

He also told the jury that on June 8, police found evidence of internet searches 'naked five year old girls' at 1.15am and, at 1.20am, 'pictures of naked virgin teens'.

He said two indecent images were saved onto the laptop at around the same time.

The photographs of Soham victims Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were among a number of images described as 'real life crime'.

Also found were pictures of Caroline Dickinson, a British 13-year-old who was murdered in France in July 1996; Jessica Lunsford, a nine-year-old murdered in Florida, the United States, in 2005; and Esra Akyuz, a six-year-old Turkish girl who was murdered in 2001.

Bridger, wearing a blue shirt and tie and round glasses, followed today’s proceedings from the dock and occasionally moved towards the glass through which he gave instructions to his solicitor.

Crime scene investigator Melanie Barlow was tasked with forensic searches of a wood burning fireplace in the living room at Bridger’s cottage, Mount Pleasant.

She said she noticed that areas of the fire had been 'cleaned up'.

She said: 'I noted an area of wiping down or cleaning up around the fire which was not consistent with the area as a whole and stood out to me.'

She said smears on the glass in the fire were, 'caused by using a cloth or something to wipe down the glass'.

Under cross examination by Brendan Kelly QC, defending Bridger, she conceded that written notes mentioning the clean up were only made last Friday - after she looked again at photographs she had taken of the scene.

Mr Kelly said: 'This is guesswork rather than scientific analysis.'

The witness replied: 'It is my opinion that that is how it appeared.'

Bridger, who followed proceedings with the help of a hearing loop, denies the abduction and murder of April, who went missing from her home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate on Monday, October 1 last year.

He also denies perverting the course of justice by concealing, destroying or disposing of her body at his cottage in the hamlet of Ceinws, five miles from Machynlleth.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
