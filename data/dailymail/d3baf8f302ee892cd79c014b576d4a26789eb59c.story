A real estate mogul is suing his estranged wife's alleged lover after he claims the pair secretly sold a $1.1million diamond to promote a book they had written about plastic surgery.

Dallas developer Lucien Crosland claimed that his former wife Mary Crosland tried to replace the diamond with a cubic zirconia after using the money to pay for the tour of her plastic surgery book which she co-wrote with Dr Rodney Rohrich.

Mary Crosland, 55, who filed for divorce last month, is at the same time suing her ex for allegedly trying to extort $10million from Dr Rohrich and threatening to ruin him.

The couple had been married for 14 years and lived in a mansion in the exclusive Dallas neighborhood of Highland Park.

Lucien Crosland, 68, who recently built a 
22,500 square feet shopping and luxury apartment complex in Dallas, claimed that 
the diamond was sold to pay for travel and hotel rooms to promote 
Navigate Your Beauty.

According to the lawsuit, filed in Dallas County District Court, Lucien Crosland bought the 23.26-carat diamond in February 2005 for $277,000.

He had it valued at $1.1million in 2008 and mounted in a ring for his wife to occasionally wear until he could find a buyer, NBC reported, She also wore it as a necklace.

The property developer went on to say that he and his wife became clients of Dr Rohrich several years ago and that his wife started having an affair with the doctor.

The lawsuit then claimed that the pair 'hatched a plan to purchase a cubic zirconia to replace the investment diamond', according to NBC. Mr Crosland claims that the pair sold the diamond and deposited the funds in the surgeon's bank account, according to Dallas News.

Dr Rohrich described himself on his website as one of most respected and top plastic surgeons in the world. He has a wife and two children, according to his online biography.

The lawsuit names Dr Rohrich and UT Southwestern Medical Center, where he is head of plastic surgery.

Navigate Your Beauty, written by the plastic surgeon and Mary Crosland, was published in April and is called a 'breakthrough' in plastic surgery

The former Mrs Crosland countered her husband's lawsuit with a motion in her divorce case last Wednesday where she claimed that husband tried to 'shake down' Dr Rohrich for $10million in May.

In her divorce papers, she alleged that she had 'endured years of his physical abuse, mental abuse, emotional abuse, drunkenness, and sadistic behavior'.

Mr Crosland claimed in divorce papers, that his wife used 'her sexual guile coupled with sociopathic cunning' to lure the doctor away from his wife.

'Navigate Your Beauty' was published in April and is available on Amazon and is described on the publicity site as a 'breakthrough book' on plastic surgery.

It has been endorsed by former supermodel Jerry Hall and philanthropist Nancy Rogers.

Mary Crosland is described on the website as 'a talented businesswoman and an advocate for women’s health and safety'. 

MailOnline was awaiting for a comment from Dr Rohrich.

In a statement today, UT Southwestern said as a policy the university does not comment on pending litigation.

MailOnline was awaiting a response 
from Stephanie Curtis, an attorney for Lucien Crosland, but she earlier 
told NBC that the extortion claims against her client were totally 
false.

Larry Friedman, an attorney for Mary Crosland, had not responded to a request for comment.

However the lawyer told the Dallas News that the diamond was a gift to his client for the couple's anniversary and she later decided to sell it. He added: 'Once you put a gem on a woman’s finger, it is there forever. And those are the rules of the game.'
