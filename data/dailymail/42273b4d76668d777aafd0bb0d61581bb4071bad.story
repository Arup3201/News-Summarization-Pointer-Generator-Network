A 13,000-square-foot San Francisco mansion has hit the market and its perfect for the trendy millionaire eager to jump on the speakeasy bar trend.

The home complete with its own Prohibition-era bar tucked neatly behind hidden doors can be yours for a cool $27 million.

‘You press a button…and what looks like a paneled wall accordions open,’ said current owner John Murphy, and, voila! The perfect place for illicit booze consumption.

Voila! This Prohibition-era bar is tucked away in an iconic mansion in San Francisco's Pacific Heights neighborhood. The 13,000-square-foot home is on the market for $27 million

Speakeasy: Though the house was built in 1905 by the Spreckels family, years before Prohibition, subsequent owners added the bar--and a 1,200-square-foot ballroom--in 1929 when liquor was illegal across America

According to the Wall Street Journal, Murphy purchased the home in 1997 after he and his wife Paula Key discovered its hidden saloon.

The couple paid $6.3 million for the Pacific Heights home at the time, but now say they’d like to downsize.

‘It's just time, at this point in our lives, to make a move to a simpler life,’ said Murphy, an author whose fortune was made after he helped found the for-profit University of Phoenix.

Built in 1905 on the sugar fortune of the Spreckels family, the home features a walnut-paneled library, wine cellar, and two walk-out terraces with stunning views of the San Francisco Bay, Golden Gate Bridge, the city itself.

The hidden bar wasn’t tucked away onto the  library clubroom until later in the handsome home’s life.

In 1929, a few years before the 21st Amendment ended 13 years of Prohibition, then owners the Schwabachers hired an architect by the name of Albert Farr to remodel the home.

In addition to the hidden bar, the Schwabachers had Farr tack on a 1,200-square-foot ballroom.

Stunning: The sprawling home features five bedrooms, a ballroom, a walnut-lined library, floor-to-ceiling views of San Francisco Bay, and two walk-out terraces

'Architectural tour de force': The stunning kitchen has even more stunning views of the city and bay

‘The Art Deco ballroom - with abundant room for scores of celebrants - is complemented by a catering kitchen and wine cellar,’ reads the description for the ‘Iconic Pacific Heights Mansion’ on the Coldwell Banker Previews International website. The listing agent is David Bellings.

After the Schwabachers and their additions came the family of Joseph Alioto, Jr., son of a former San Francisco mayor.

Murphy became only the fourth owner of the nearly 100-year-old home.

He and his wife are in search of the person who will be the fifth as they plan to spend more time at the Napa Valley residence.

Keeping up appearances: The home has a total of five bedrooms, including two for the staff with separate entrance

Gorgeous: The lavish home was purchased by John Murphy, who bought it in 1997 for $6.3 million. It has now hit the market for a cool $27 million
