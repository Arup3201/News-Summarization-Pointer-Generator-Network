Aidy Boothroyd has selected his England under 20 squad for the forthcoming friendlies with Mexico and the United States.

His 22-man group features a number of names who have impressed in the Sky Bet Championship this season, as well as some promising youngsters at Barclays Premier League clubs.

The Young Lions play Mexico at The Hive, home of Barnet, on March 25 (7.45pm) before heading down to Devon to take on the USA at Plymouth's Home Park on March 29 (3pm).

Chelsea's Lewis Baker, currently on loan at Swindon, has also been selected 

Among those picked by Boothroyd are Arsenal's Chuba Akpom and Chelsea duo Lewis Baker, currently on loan at MK Dons, and John Swift, playing for Swindon at present.

The leading lights selected from Championship clubs include Derby's Kwame Thomas, Nottingham Forest's Ben Osborn and Alex Mowatt of Leeds United.

Brentford defender Moses Odubajo and Derby midfielder Jamie Hanson are called up for the first time.

'It has been four months since we were last together and after an excellent start to a new team’s campaign we are now finding our players dotted around the Football League and Premier League, which will only add to their experience when they play for England,' said Boothroyd.

'We are now looking forward to building on that momentum with the double-header against USA and Mexico.

'Our opponents this March have been carefully selected as we continue to provide the players with a full and varied development programme.

'Both USA and Mexico will be competing in the FIFA U20 World Cup in New Zealand, and both fixtures promise to be challenging encounters for us. Each challenge will require maximum concentration and discipline from every player. Another invaluable lesson for them in their future careers.'

Tickets for both games are still on sale now, priced at £3 for adults and £1.50. Call 0208 381 3800 for tickets at the Hive, and 0845 872 3335 for the game in Plymouth.
