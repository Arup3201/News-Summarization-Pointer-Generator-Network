Tragedy: Mason Timmins, aged seven, pictured on a family holiday, died from meningitis

The parents of a seven-year-old boy made the heartbreaking decision to switch off his life support machine after he contracted meningitis.

Mason Timmins had been vaccinated against the disease  but fell ill last weekend with a rare form and passed away within hours.

His mother Claire, 34, said: ‘We’re not the type of parents who panic at every cough and snuffle, and I survived meningitis as a child so we were aware of the signs to look out for.

'He didn’t really get any better and we took him to the doctor’s as he suddenly became really pale.’

Mason was admitted to hospital, and after tests was transferred for specialist care.

‘He had been vaccinated against meningitis but not this particular type, which is a rare type,’ she said.

‘We knew there was nothing more that could be done for him, we knew we had lost him and we didn’t want him messed about with, so allowed his life support machine to be turned off.’

Mason’s father Mark, a welder, said: ‘I held him until I felt his heart stop beating and we are all grateful we were able to be with him and say goodbye.’

He said of the funeral:  ‘We asked if the car that carries Mason can speed up a little bit on the motorway, as Mason was always telling us to go “faster, faster”.

'It would make me so happy if he knew that we’d done that for him.’

The 47-year-old added: ‘We’re all mad about motorbikes in the family – his grandad has a Harley-Davidson – and we think as he got older he might have been a mechanic. He was always tinkering away with a spanner in his hand when he got the chance.’

Health officials and parents at Mason’s school, Little Bloxwich Primary in Walsall, have met to discuss symptoms and the risk to other children, which is described as very low. Anyone who came into close contact with Mason has been offered antibiotics.

Mrs Timmins, a teaching assistant, stressed: ‘We don’t want parents to panic about meningitis.

‘Please read our story and be aware of the symptoms and get medical help if you feel your child is really unwell.

‘But what happened to Mason is rare and people shouldn’t forget that.’

There are about 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and related septicaemia in the UK every year. One in ten prove fatal.

Symptoms can include a high temperature, severe headache, a dislike of bright lights, a stiff neck, aches and pains, drowsiness and a purple rash of spots or small bruises which do not fade if pressed.

In small babies, a refusal to feed or a high-pitched cry can also be a sign of infection.
