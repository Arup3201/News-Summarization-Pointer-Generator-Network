Rain as acidic as lemon juice may have played a part in killing off plants and organisms around the world during the most severe mass extinction in Earth's history.

A team of U.S. scientists have simulated the Great Dying, which occurred around 252 million years ago, when the vast majority of species became extinct.

While the massive extinction is a matter of scientific debate, the researchers found that sulphur emissions from massive volcano eruptions, were significant enough to create extremely acidic rain, which could have affected plant growth.

 The Great Dying is the Earth's most severe known extinction event, with up to 96 per cent of all marine species and 70 per cent of terrestrial vertebrate species becoming extinct.

Scientists largely believe it was made up of three phases, including a gradual environmental change and a catastrophic event.

Possible catastrophes include a massive chain of volcanic eruptions, fires from the Siberian Traps and a sudden release of methane clathrate from the sea floor, which is also known as fire ice.

Pin-pointing the exact cause of the Great Dying is difficult as much as the evidence created some 250 million years ago has now disappeared or is concealed within multiple layers of rock.

A huge impact event has been suggested as a possible cause of the mass extinction, based on the examination of grains of 'shocked quartz' and meteorite fragments in Antarctica, but no impact site has been found.

One of the attractions of the theory is that it could trigger other causes such as the Siberian Traps eruptions.

Widespread ocean anoxia (a severe deficiency of oxygen) has also been blamed for the event in the Late Permian to the Early Triassic.

The spread of toxic, oxygen-depleted water would have been devastating for marine life, producing widespread die-offs.

Models of ocean chemistry show that anoxia and euxinia (the presence of hydrogen sulphide) would have been closely associated with high levels of carbon dioxide, which suggests a combination of gases acted as a killing mechanism.

Scientists believe the sequence of events leading to anoxic oceans may have been triggered by carbon dioxide emissions from the eruption of the Siberian Traps.

Researchers at MIT investigated the theory for the Great Dying that volcanic eruptions in the Siberian Traps triggered a cascade of environmental events.

They discovered that sulphur emissions were significant enough to create widespread acid rain throughout the Northern Hemisphere, with pH levels reaching 2 - as acidic as undiluted lemon juice.

They believe such acidity may have been sufficient to disfigure plants and stunt their growth, contributing to their ultimate extinction.

‘Imagine you're a plant that's growing happily in the latest Permian,’ said Benjamin Black, a postdoctoral researcher in MIT's Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.

‘It's been getting hotter and hotter, but perhaps your species has had time to adjust to that.

But then quite suddenly, over the course of a few months, the rain begins to sizzle with sulphuric acid. It would be quite a shock if you were that plant,’ he said.

Geologists who have examined the rock record in Siberia have observed evidence of a huge chain of volcanic eruptions that came in short bursts beginning near the end of the Permian period and continued for another million years.

The volume of magma produced, was several million cubic kilometres, which is enough to completely cover the U.S.

This boiling stew of magma probably released carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, leading to gradual but powerful global warming, according to the study, which was published in the journal Geology.

The eruptions may also have released large clouds of sulphur, which ultimately returned to Earth's surface as acid rain.

Dr Black, who is the lead author of the study, spent several summers in Siberia collecting samples to measure sulphur and other chemicals preserved in igneous rocks.

He used these measurements, along with other evidence, to develop simulations of magmatic activity in the end-Permian world.

Together with researchers from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research and the Carnegie Institution for Science, he simulated 27 scenarios, each approximating the release of gases from a plausible volcanic episode, including medium eruptions, large eruptions and magma erupted through explosive pipes in the Earth's crust.

The researchers included a wide range of gases in their simulations, based on estimates from chemical analyses and thermal modelling.

They then tracked water in the atmosphere and the interactions among various gases and aerosols, to calculate the pH acidity of rain at the time.

The results showed that both carbon dioxide and volcanic sulphur could have significantly affected the acidity of rain at the end of the Permian, which led to the Great Dying.

After the eruptions ended, the researchers found believe pH levels in rain bounced back, becoming less acidic within one year.

However, with repeated bursts of volcanic activity, Dr Black says the resulting swings in acid rain could have greatly stressed terrestrial species.

‘Plants and animals wouldn't have much time to adapt to these changes in the pH of rain,’ he said. ‘I think it certainly contributed to the environmental stress which was making it difficult for plants and animals to survive. At a certain point you have to ask, “How much can a plant take?”’

The researchers also modelled ozone depletion resulting from volcanic activity.

Their results suggested that a mix of gases released into the atmosphere may have destroyed between five and 65 per cent of the ozone layer, substantially increasing species' exposure to ultraviolet radiation.

Dr Black hopes palaeontologists and geochemists will consider the results as a point of comparison for their own observations of the end-Permian mass extinction.

He said: ‘It's not just one thing that was unpleasant. It's this whole host of really nasty atmospheric and environmental effects.

'These results really made me feel sorry for end-Permian organisms.’
