A severely autistic 14-year-old boy, Alex Spourdalakis, was found stabbed to death in the apartment he shared with his mother, Dorothy Spourdalakis, in the suburban Chicago town of River Grove Sunday afternoon. Both his mother and his caregiver were also found in the room, semi-conscious.

The boy's father, who doesn't live at the apartment, had been calling the family and was unable to get through so he went over with the boy's uncle to see if anything was wrong.

'They couldn't reach the family by phone, so they went over and gained entry to the apartment,' River Grove Police Chief Rodger Loni told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. They called police around 3 p.m. when they discovered the body, and found the two women somewhat conscious.

According to Loni, they found the boy with several stab wounds to the chest that looked 'domestic in nature.' The boy's mother and caretaker, both 50, were also found in the room incoherent and somewhat unconscious.One was on the bed and the other was on the floor.

The boy was pronounced dead at the scene while the two women were taken to Gottlieb Hospital in Melrose Park to recover. Neither had any visual injuries. Loni said they may have taken drugs before police arrived.

Police found a hand-written note at the scene that explains what happened, with both women's names - but have not released further details about the piece of evidence.

No answer: When no one answered the phone, the boy's father and uncle went over to the apartment and discovered Alex dead

River Grove Police and the Western Suburban Major Crimes Task Force are currently investigating the case as a 'death investigation.' Loni says that they suspect foul play but are waiting on a medical examiner's autopsy, scheduled for Monday afternoon, to determine whether the boy's death was homicide. Police did not find the weapon in the apartment, and there was no sign of a break-in.

The boy's father is cooperating in the investigation and the mother has already issued a statement. The caregiver, however, is not cooperating.

Police believe that the two women may hold the answers to what happened Sunday.

'They know something that happened there, but whether they're responsible or not, I can't say at this point in time,' Loni told CBS Chicago.

This wasn't the first time that River Grove police had been called to the Spourdalakis home. The 6-foot, 225 pound boy often became hard to manage when the women needed to take him to doctor's appointments, so they would have to call the police to restrain him. According to police, they had been called to the apartment seven times since November 2012.

Loni described the boy as 'a big, strong, young man.'

Alex was in the news last March when FOX 32 profiled the boy. His mother believed he was being mistreated at a local hospital where where he was staying for gastrointestinal issues. The staff kept him in restraints the whole time.

She said her son was severely autistic and non-verbal and that doctors labelled him as cognitively impaired. 

Interviewed: The boy's mother, Dorothy Spourdalakis, was interviewed this past March when he was being kept in restraints at a local hospital. Dorothy has already issued a statement to the police but the caregiver is not cooperating
