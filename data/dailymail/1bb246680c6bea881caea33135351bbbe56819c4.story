A wife-beater who stabbed his partner to death with a kitchen knife has been jailed for life.

Ian Hope had repeatedly assaulted Sarah Gosling, 41, during their relationship but his final, deadly attack left her with no blood left in her body.

The single stab wound, inflicted with a knife to her chest, severed an artery and led to rapid bleeding and then death.

Sarah Gosling, 41, who was stabbed to death by her partner during a row at their home in February

When police asked what had happened, the 53-year-old said: 'She’s been on at me.'

During a trial at Newcastle Crown Court the paramedic who attended to Miss Gosling said: 'She had no blood within her circulatory system.

'I gave her fluid through a vein and it went through her system and was just coming out of the wound as water.'

The attack came just weeks after Hope split Miss Gosling’s head open with a rolling pin because she 'wouldn’t shut up'.

During the trial Hope claimed the kitchen knife 'ended up in her' after she hit him with a bottle during a row as he used the weapon to prepare chicken for dinner.

But prosecutor John Elvedge QC told jurors: 'The prosecution say Sarah Gosling was the victim of a sustained attack in the course of which a number of blows were delivered by the defendant.

'At the time he stabbed her he intended to kill her or cause her serious injury.'

After just an hour of deliberation, jurors found the former distribution worker guilty of murder.  Hope shook his head as the jury foreman announced the guilty verdict yesterday.

Judge Paul Sloan QC said Hope must serve at least 17 years behind bars before he can even apply for parole.

The judge told him: 'A row erupted into violence and I am satisfied, as on previous occasions, you were the aggressor.

The judge told him: 'A row erupted into violence and I am satisfied, as on previous occasions, you were the aggressor.

'You
punched her at least twice to the face, causing her injury, causing a 
black eye and a gaping laceration to the inside of her bottom lip from 
her lip having been forced into her teeth by the blow.

'She defended herself and hit you back, striking you on the nose, causing it to bleed.

'Perhaps
because she had the temerity to fight back and bloody your nose, you 
armed yourself quite deliberately with a kitchen knife and you set about
attacking Sarah Gosling with that knife.

'She
tried to defend herself, warding off knife blows with her hand and in 
the process she sustained five wounds to the back of her left hand.

'Eventually
you drove the blade into her right upper chest. Sarah Gosling collapsed
and bled to death within a short space of time.'

Neighbours complained of a disturbance: The scene on Tewkesbury Road, Newcastle, after Sarah Gosling was knifed to death by her partner. Police had attended hours before the attack but left after the couple reassured them

The judge said Miss Gosling’s death has had a 'devastating' effect on her family and added: 'Their loss is immeasurable, no sentence I can impose will ease their pain.'

He added that the jury clearly saw through Hope’s 'fabricated account' of what happened that night between the couple, who had met on Facebook in 2009.

The court heard that just over a week before the killing, Hope had been ordered to go on a domestic violence course after cutting her head open with a rolling pin in January.

A month after that attack, on 
February 25, Hope rang the emergency services to say he had stabbed the 
supermarket worker after an argument at their home in Tewkesbury Road, 
Lemington, Newcastle.

The 
police had been at the house an hour before after neighbours complained 
of a disturbance, but left after assurances from the couple that 
everything was fine.

The court heard Ms Gosling, originally from Guernsey, had suffered ten black eyes in a year at the hands of Hope.

Mr
Elvedge told jurors: 'It is a fact that the defendant unlawfully 
assaulted her on a number of occasions, sometimes using weapons.

'For
example, on Jan 18 2012, when he hit her with a rolling pin while she 
was in bed, causing a deep laceration which required hospital treatment 
by staples.'

The Law Courts on Newcastle upon Tyne's Quayside, where Hope was sentenced

The court heard Miss Gosling had taken photographs of her own injuries from March 2011 until a week before her death.

Mr
Elvedge added: 'Those photos show she had sustained black eyes in a 
number of occasions which, say the prosecution, were deliberately and 
unlawfully inflicted by the defendant.'

Jamie Hill QC, defending, said Hope has summoned help immediately after the incident and showed 'regret' straight away.

Following Hope’s sentencing, DCI 
Christina Barrett, Northumbria Police Senior Investigating Officer, 
said: 'My thoughts have been with Sarah’s family throughout this 
investigation, it has been a difficult ordeal and has had a devastating 
impact on them.

'Hope has shown no remorse whatsoever and has never admitted his actions, continually denying he had murdered Sarah.'

Following the guilty verdict and sentence, Miss Gosling’s brother, Andrew Bernard said: 'Sarah Gosling was a mother, daughter and sister when she was robbed of her young life by Ian Hope.

'Before she met Hope she was an important part of a family with a husband, son and daughter. She had a stable life.

'Sarah’s death was completely unexpected to her mother, Jean. She remains to this day, nine months on, in denial, in shock and in mourning.

'She told me this week that she was "heartbroken" by Sarah’s death. It is of small comfort that our father David passed away quickly in 2003, for there is no doubt that as an ex-policeman, witnessing this would have crushed him.

'Being in court in the past two weeks has been the most harrowing and horrific time of my life.

'I thought I’d be able to cope with hearing the evidence, that my disgust in Ian Hope would somehow carry me through hearing about the circumstances of Sarah’s life in the North East and of her death at his hands.

'Nothing could have prepared me or Val, my wife, for hearing of the systematic and brutal way he controlled Sarah, their jealous fights, his continued goading of her using Facebook, their alcohol abuse and the violence he meted out "to shut her up".

'The verdict of murder is justice for Ian Hope.

'The pain that his killing of my sister has left us with will remain always.

'It is not lost on us the irony of the name "Hope" and this name will be a sickening reminder of what he has stolen from Sarah, her future, her children, and her wider family and friends.'
