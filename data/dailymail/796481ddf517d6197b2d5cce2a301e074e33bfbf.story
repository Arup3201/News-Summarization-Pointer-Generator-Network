A shy polar bear cub needed a gentle push from its mother the first time it ventured outside.

The tiny ball of fluff only opened her eyes in January with mum Kay keeping her inside until she was happy they could explore safely.

When the time came to finally reveal themselves to the world it seemed the little bear was struck down with a spot of stage fight.

So mum had to go back and pick her cub up - proudly showing off her young for visitors at Novosibirsk Zoo in Russia to see.

The nervous newborn, who will be named by zoo guests, initially stayed close to its mum but soon got used to her new surroundings and wanted to play.

Mother Kay lovingly rolled around in the cold snow nestling her daughter into her chest.

But she eventually got worn out by the youngsters energy and crashed flat out asleep to recover.

The heartwarming scenes were captured by keen photographer Anton Belovodchenko, 33, while he was visiting the zoo.

He said: 'This little cub is the firstborn for Kay and dad Gerda.Â 

'She was very small in comparison to Kay but was still so white and fluffy.

'I'd never seen a seen a young polar bear before so was surprised to see Kay teaching her baby how to take her first steps.'
