More than a dozen diners enjoying a late breakfast at the trendy Balthazar Cafe in Soho were struck by a giant 10-foot mirror that fell off a wall.

One person, later identified as former French Minister Arnaud Montebourg, was taken to Bellevue Hospital suffering from minor injuries. The socialist politician, who left his post last year, was in the US on an anti-austerity speaking tour when he was injured. 

The incident took place just after 10am at restaurateur Keith McNally’s popular French brasserie, which for years has been drawing a steady stream of celebrity patrons, including David and Victoria Beckham, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Jimmy Fallon and many others.

Back in business: The trendy dining spot was open for lunch Friday. It is possible to make out in the back an empty space on the wall where the hulking mirror had hung  

A photo taken by diner Liz Eswein showed a wall-sized, 10-by-15 foot mirror laying across several tables in the middle of the dining room.

In a tweet sent after the incident, Eswein praised the FDNY for arriving to the scene within moments.

The eyewitness said the injured patron looked like a tourist. According to FDNY, he sustained non-life-threatening injuries.

French press has identified the victim as 52-year-old Arnaud Montebourg, a Sorbonne-educated left-wing French politician who served for two years as Minister of Industrial Renewal.

Montebourg, a father of two, was spotted holding a napkin to a bleeding head wound, DNAInfo reported. 

Despite his injury, the liberal French politician lended a helping hand to his fellow diners, lifting the hulking mirror like 'superman,' as some witnesses have put it to the New York Post. 

The paper quoted Balthazar patrons as saying that the 52-year-old foreign national unleashed a torrent of swear words, but otherwise seemed nonplussed. 

The French publication Paris Match reported that Montebourg was having breakfast with his girlfriend, French Minister of Culture and Communication Aurelie Filippetti, when the accident occurred.

Familiar face: Montebourg was in town after visiting Nobel laureate and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman at Princeton the day before 

At around 1.15pm, French journalist Elisabeth Guedel tweeted a photo of Montebourg standing outside Bellevue Hospital. The caption read that the 52-year-old anti-austerity crusader was 'okay' after being discharged.

Montebourg was in town after traveling to Princeton University the day before to meet up with Nobel laureate and New York Times opinion columnist Paul Krugman. He posted a photo on his Twitter page Thursday showing the two men shaking hands.

The image was accompanied by a caption in French, which in translation read: 'At Princeton, have thanked the Nobel Paul Krugman for his fight against suicidal austerity led by the gvt of EU.'

Montebourg was scheduled to give a talk at Princeton Monday evening. The French-language edition of The Huffington Post reported that the lecture will go on as planned.  

Balthazar patron William Chervit told Gothamist that when he saw the enormous mirror crash onto diners at an adjacent table, he was certain that somebody was dead.

About 15 people rushed over to the stricken table and attempted to lift the behemoth mirror, but it proved too heavy at first. 

Since opening its doors in 1997, Balthazar has become a popular dining spot for celebrities and visiting dignitaries of every stripe, including Sofia Lauren, Jimmy Fallon, Katie Holmes and Julienne Moore, to name just a few.

David and Victoria Beckham are frequent guests at the eatery. On Monday, the singer-turned-acclaimed designer, who was in town for the New York Fashion Week, enjoyed a dinner date at the Spring Street brasserie with her soccer-star husband.

it remains unknown at this time what caused the hulking brass looking glass - one of four bolted to the walls at the eatery - to give way and fall.

The management of the restaurant declined to comment to the Daily Mail about the mirror accident Friday morning, only saying that the eatery was open for lunch.
