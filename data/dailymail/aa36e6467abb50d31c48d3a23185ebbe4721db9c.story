Secret Service agents will now have to wait 10 hours to drive government cars if they've been drinking alcohol, according to an internal agency memo.

The stricter policy comes weeks after a video surfaced showing two agents hitting a security barricade just outside a secured bomb-threat investigation scene at the White House. 

The two agents have been accused of operating the government vehicle after drinking at a nearby bar.

Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy said the agency has adopted a new policy requiring agents to wait 10 hours after drinking before they can operate a government vehicle

Previous Secret Service rules barred agents from getting behind agency vehicles if they were drunk or impaired by alcohol, according to the Washington Post.

According to the memo, obtained by the Post, any agents who violated the new policy could face 'disciplinary and adverse actions' that included 'removal from employment'. 

The memo also reminded agents that they were responsible for 'conducting themselves in a manner that reflects the highest standards of the United States Government'. 

This isn't the first time the agency's drinking policy has changed after a public incident. 

Special Operations Secret Service agents are now prohibited from drinking alcohol within 12 hours of reporting for duty and 24 hours before the president arrives during an overseas trip.

The changes were enacted after three agents tasked with protecting President Obama in Amsterdam were put on administrative leave when a night of drinking caused one agent to pass out in his hotel hallway.

Secret Service Director Joseph P. Clancy admitted before Congress last week that some agents were turning to alcohol to deal with the job.

'There's an element within our agency that does cope with stresses... by using alcohol,' Clancy said, noting that the agency recently launched an initiative to address stress.

'We've got to find a way to help some of these people that are going toward alcohol as a coping mechanism.' 

Clancy revealed the new drinking policy  during a congressional hearing regarding the March 4 incident.

The House Oversight Committee heard testimony about how Clancy only learned about the incident after this message had already circulated among agents for several days

The director has come under fire since the accident, which occurred while on-duty officers and agents were investigating a suspicious package thrown near the White House  and an accompanying threat that it contained a bomb.

The House Oversight Committee showed the video from the Washington Metropolitan Police Department during the Capitol Hill hearing. 

Clancy said he only heard about the allegation that the two agents were intoxicated after an anonymous email began circulating within the agency - five days after the incident occurred.

The email described the off-duty employees as 'both extremely intoxicated' after another agent's retirement party.

The email then claims uniformed Secret Service officers at the scene were 'going to arrest both of them' but were instructed not to by their commander. 

'A lot of people got this email,' Maryland Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings told Clancy. 'But you didn't.'

Clancy said it was 'unacceptable' that he had been out of the loop. 

'Our mission is too important for this to happen,' he told the congressional panel. 'It undermines my leadership.'

Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz said the Secret Service's 'litany of recent mishaps' was unacceptable and raised 'major concerns' about the agency's ability to protect the president. 

Legislation proposing reforms to the Secret Service was introduced in the House on Thursday, according to the Washington Post. 

The proposal asks that the Senate be required to confirm the agency's director.

It also authorizes hiring 200 more officers and 80 agents, in addition to new methods for assessing threats against the White House.

Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte said that, although Clancy has 'taken many steps to begin to reform the Secret Service', Congress believed it was 'clear that legislative action is needed'. 

'After a series of embarrassing security failures and instances of poor judgement, the American people have lost confidence in the Secret Service's ability to protect the president,' he said in a statement. 

'From threats from outside entities, and from within the agency itself.' 

January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment.

The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the crone hobbyist lost control of the device.

October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs and arrested by the Secret Service.

September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured.

The shocking security breach launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation.

Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave.

And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn.

August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates.

May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House.

June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House.

November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for while being filmed by cameras for their reality show.
