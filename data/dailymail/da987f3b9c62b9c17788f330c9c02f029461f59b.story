Just because the United States is rebuilding ties with Cuba doesn't mean American citizens will have free reign to the country's coveted cigars and rum.

U.S. travelers will only be allowed to bring back $400 worth of goods and  no more than $100 of those items can be tobacco and alcohol for which the country is famous.

The New York Post reports that cigar lovers can only come home with two Cohiba Corano Especiales which run a hefty $34 each.

Don't be greedy: U.S. travelers will only be allowed to bring back $400 worth of goods and no more than $100 of those items can be tobacco and alcohol for which the country is famous

Two for you: cigar lovers can only come home with two Cohiba Corano Especiales which run a hefty $34 each

They also may only tow Six Bolivar Coronas Juniors which each go for $16.00

Those American voyagers who don't have an expensive smoking habit can get drinks for a slightly lower price.

Rum drinkers can bring back three 750ml bottles of Havana Club rum at $31 each.

Travel to Cuba is permitted for the first time since President John F. Kennedy severed relations in 1961-but not for tourism.

Only Americans with family in Cuba, educators, aid workers and journalists may travel to the country for the time being.

People traveling for government business, athletics, cultural events, support for Cuban people, and medical research may also enter the country.

The Post reports that approved travelers can use their credit and debit cards on the island and that Americans can also send $2,000 to family every three months- up from $500.

Also those visiting Cuba hoping to email family at home may have very slow internet connection.

The Wall Street Journal reports  that almost no ordinary Cubans have access to the Internet and that very slow internet will be available at hotel.

This may change, however. The new rules allow U.S. companies to export telecommunications equipment to strengthen internet for both Cubans and Americans.
