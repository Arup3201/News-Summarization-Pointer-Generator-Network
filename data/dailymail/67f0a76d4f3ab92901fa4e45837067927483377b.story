A man, who is believed to be a 21-year-old university student, has started a dangerous craze around Britain's campuses - downing bottles of alcohol as quickly as possible on camera.

In a series of videos, which have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times across the world, the man who is thought to study at the University of Leeds, covers his face with a  ski-mask to 'protect his identity.'

He then completes various dangerous alcohol challenges, which have been deemed by one alcohol charity as both 'foolish' and 'embarrassing.'

But now his videos have sparked so many copycat clips that the student even faked his own admission to hospital to warn others of the dangers after realising he was 'sending out the wrong message.'

Challenge: A man, who is believed to be a 21-year-old university student, has started a dangerous craze around Britain's campuses - being filmed downing alcohol as quickly as possible

The Leeds Student newspaper reported that the student drunk 'close to 160 units of alcohol on screen in just two weeks -  almost four times the maximum suggested amount for that period of time.'

In one video, filmed in a kitchen with an audience, he drinks a pint of vodka in seven seconds, while in another - deemed 'the rainbow challenge' - he downs a bottle of red wine, a bottle of white wine and a bottle of rose within a minute.

Since he began posting the videos as 'Man Vs Booze' on YouTube just over a month ago, his online following has grown each time he produced another 'episode' - each more risky than the last.

When some users commented that he may be drinking water, the man lit a pint of sambuca in front of the camera before downing it.

Binge drinking: Leeds Student website reported that the 21-year-old decided things had to stop earlier this month and pretended he had been admitted to hospital for an alcohol related incident

Rory Anderson, news editor of the Leeds Student newspaper, who also says various sources have confirmed he is drinking alcohol, spoke to the man in the video.

He told Mr Anderson: 'I’m worried all this attention is getting to my head.'

Mr Anderson said the student has 'become something of a campus legend.'

'He has proven himself to be a huge hit with students across the country who have been impressed with both his drinking ability and the entertaining persona he adopts in the videos,' he said.

He said that one fan 'even had 'MvB' tattooed on his backside whilst another wrote on YouTube that the unidentified student was 'more inspiring than my Dad'.

Dangerous craze: Since he began posting the videos as 'Man Vs Booze' on YouTube just over a month ago,  his online following has grown each time he produced another 'episode' - each more risky than the last. In this video he downs a bottle of jäger and a large bottle of an energy drink poured into a bin

The student now has close to 10,000 followers on his Twitter page: @officialmvb and a similar number of fans on his official Facebook page.

Worryingly, the series of videos, which has now hit 12, have been widely watched in Britain's universities and now a growing number of students across the country seem to want to match 'Man Vs. Booze' drinking.

They have posted response videos of themselves downing massive amounts of alcohol in a bid to be 'Britain's biggest student drinker'.

One of these, the 'Swansea Student Drinker', from Swansea University, has even posted a video reply in which he downs a pint of Jack Daniels and a pint of vodka in 30 seconds.

Sparking a trend: Worryingly, the series of videos have been widely watched in Britain's universities and now a growing number of students across the country seem to want to match 'Man Vs. Booze' drinking 'achievements'

Tweet: Leeds Student website reported that the 21-year-old decided things had to stop earlier this month and pretended he had been admitted to hospital for an alcohol related incident

The student explained why he pretended to get admitted to hospital in an email to Leeds Student.

He write: 'When [Man Vs Booze] gained in popularity I realised that it was sending out the wrong message and too many people were trying to replicate it. This is when I decided to take action by fabricating the story that I had been admitted to hospital; to deter anyone else from trying to drink these irresponsible amounts of alcohol.'

On his Twitter page, the student had written: 'This is MVBs housemate- he's just been taken to hospital after 2 pints of absinthe, please don't anyone try copy him, it's dangerous.'

The videos have worrying health implications - under government guidelines men are advised not to drink more than four units in any one day - in one video the man consumes 18 units within one minute.

Chris Sorek, Chief Executive of alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: 'There’s nothing wrong with enjoying a few drinks on a night out but there are both short and long-term health and social harms that can come from overdoing it.

'Drinking to excess in a short period of time can cause an individual’s blood alcohol concentration to sky-rocket and can lead to nausea, confusion, loss of bladder and bowel control and ‘passing out’.

'In the most serious cases, alcohol poisoning can cause slowed breathing and result in a coma or even death.

'Socially, the digital world we live in means that people who have been drinking to excess can have their actions come back to haunt them online. What might appear fun when drunk can feel foolish and embarrassing in the cold light of day.'

Leeds University Union Welfare Officer, Harriet Rankin, has told students she does not condone the behaviour and urged all students who have watched the video not to try anything similar.

Leeds Student Union said they 'were aware' that the student media have covered the story, but they could not confirm or deny the man in the video was a student at the university.
