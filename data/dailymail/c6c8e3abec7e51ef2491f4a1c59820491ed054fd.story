'The conditions were really windy and the nerves kicked in too. It was tough but I felt I dealt with all the pressure coming off beating the number one seed. I felt I had to back it up.'

Great Britain Fed Cup captain Judy Murray was watching courtside and will be pleased that Swan managed to back up her upset win against Chinese top seed Shilin Xu on Wednesday.

A victory for Swan on Friday wil guarantee her a place in Saturday's final on the Rod Laver Arena 

She now goes on to play Hungarian fifth seed and close friend Dalma Galfi in Friday's semi-finals and victory would guarantee her an appearance on the Rod Laver Arena for Saturday's final.

Of the prospect of playing on the main show court at Melbourne Park, Swan said: 'I was just thinking that's going to be amazing for whoever is in the final.

'I did not think that would be me. I'm close now and I just have to focus on tomorrow's match. It's a big goal to win a grand slam title, junior and senior.'

Former world No 21 Annabel Croft is the last Brit to triumph in the girls' singles Down Under, winning the event in 1984 when it was played on the grass courts of Kooyong.
