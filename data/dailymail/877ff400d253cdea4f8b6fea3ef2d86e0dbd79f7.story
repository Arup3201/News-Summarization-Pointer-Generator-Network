These days you're nobody unless you've been thrown off a plane. 

Whether it's down to one too many sharpeners, being caught with your pants down, dressing or acting like a buffoon, or being simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, everyone's doing it.

Cranberries lead singer Dolores O'Riordan was detained for allegedly turning violent on a flight from New York to Ireland last week.

She was subsequently released without charge. But there are plenty of stars who have ended up in hot water for misbehaving at 35,000 ft. Here is our pick of the best...

Liam Gallagher vs Cathay Pacific

DATE: 1998

INCIDENT: Liam Gallagher reportedly had the mother of all meltdowns during a flight from Hong Kong to Perth over a scone some years ago. Reports vary as to the catalyst.

Some say it was the scone's shape that offended the 42-year-old Oasis front man, others that he was refused the British delicacy. Either way, it led to the tempestuous rocker to reportedly threaten the pilot with a baked good.

Passengers on the Cathay Pacific flight complained that Oasis band members wouldn't stop smoking, threw things and swore at flight attendants.

At one point the captain allegedly considered a detour to force the band and their entourage off the plane. Cathay Pacific got their own back as Liam was banned for life from the airline. He responded by claiming he'd rather walk to Australia rather than fly on Cathay Pacific again.

A passenger who was sitting across the aisle from the actor said Baldwin, now 56, became 'violent, abusive and aggressive' after repeated requests to switch it off. 

The passenger said, 'He got into the bathroom and started beating on the wall and he pounded his fists on the galley counter. Yelling, screaming, very ugly. It was unsafe to keep him on board that's why he got kicked out.' 

The actor left the American Airlines flight because he was not able to continue playing a game on his phone 

Balwin was let off the flight at Los Angeles and tweeted 'Flight attendant on American [Airlines] reamed me out 4 playing WORDS W FRIENDS while we sat at the gate, not moving.'

The French actor's representatives claimed the actor had tried to answer the call of nature 'as discreetly as possible'.

His spokesman added: 'Gerard is very sorry to have spilt some on the plane's carpet.'
