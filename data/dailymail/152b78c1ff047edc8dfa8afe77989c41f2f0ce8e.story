For the hero of the hour, there was to be no long night’s sleep. Still, if the baby girl who provided the inspiration for Radoslaw Cierzniak’s penalty shoot-out derring-do was always likely to interrupt Daddy’s slumbers, he could always seek out his usual remedy - winning coffees from his team-mates in a practice-ground spot-kick competition.

Cierzniak would probably have needed something extra strong, an intense espresso or the like, on Thursday morning. The Dundee United team coach wouldn’t have hit the city limits until well after midnight following their hugely dramatic League Cup quarter-final win over Hibs at Easter Road.

And the Polish goalie may well have been feeling particularly knackered, having first excelled during regulation and extra time, before making two penalty saves - one standard, the other quite extraordinary - to send United to a Hampden semi-final by dint of a 7-6 win.

Dundee United's Radoslaw Cierzniak saved two penalties during the Scottish League Cup quarter-final

Revealing the psychology he had employed to first thwart Matthew Kennedy’s tame effort, when conceding would have seen United dumped out of the competition, and then David Gray’s brilliantly-struck attempt, Cierzniak - booked for his clowning around during the shoot-out - said: ‘Of course I was dancing around on the goal line, trying to put the Hibs players off. Every goalkeeper does this. You have to try something.

‘To be honest, I was upset with myself because, all the time, I seemed to be choosing the wrong way. How many penalties did I face before I saved one? Five, six, seven?

‘So I told myself: “Come on, I have to help my team. I have to do this for myself”. I managed to save one.

‘For the last penalty, I thought about my daughter, Nella. She is just five months old, my first child. I said: “OK, I have to make one more save for Nella”. She is very special to me, so I wanted to do something for her.

‘Everything I do is for her and, hopefully, she will be able to watch a video of this in the future = and I’ll tell her I was thinking of her when I made the last save.’

The United stopper helped his side to triumph 7-6 on penalties against Hibernian on Wednesday night

There were times on Wednesday night when it seemed as if the identity of the fourth League Cup semi-finalist would be left unknown into the wee small hours, so expertly were the penalties despatched by both sides.

With player after player either thundering shots into corners or deftly disguising their intentions, it was always going to take something special from one of the goalkeepers to settle the tie. Step forward Cierzniak, a well-travelled 31-year-old who admits to being almost obsessive about the art of the penalty.

‘We practice penalties a lot - all the time,’ he said. ‘We have penalty competitions to see who buys the coffees. It’s a very good laugh, with a serious side, because you know it can come in handy.

‘Last week, we actually didn’t practice. We were too busy with a lot of other things. But we do practice them a lot and I think, as a goalkeeper, it’s very helpful. I have to thank the players and the staff for helping me practice.

‘No, I don’t have to buy the coffees very often, actually. Sometimes I have to – but I like to win! I just have to thank the team, because they give me such confidence that I felt very calm when it came to the shoot-out against Hibs.

‘I never study opponents’ penalties before games. It wouldn’t help much in a shoot-out, when you are facing so many.

‘I knew a few Hibs players from last season but, to be honest, I didn’t expect the game to go to extra time and penalties. In a shoot-out, or even when practising, I think it’s about what you feel on the line. How you feel the guy is going to shoot it.

Cierzniak's two saves mean that United will head to Hampden Park for a Scottish League Cup semi-final

‘It was a very busy night even before the penalties. The first thing I have to say is that Hibs played very, very well. Both teams tried to play football and Hibs should be very proud of how they performed. But I am really proud we made it into the semi-finals, of course.’

Cierzniak admits to having a slight preference ahead of Saturday’s draw for the semis, saying: ‘I’ll be honest, I would like to play against Celtic - or maybe Rangers. I like the big games.

‘But we’ll have to play very well to beat anyone left in the draw, Aberdeen are a very good team. We have confidence, though. So, if we play well, I don’t care who we play against.’

While Cierzniak rightly received plenty of plaudits for his performance, there is little doubt Hibs deserved much praise for their efforts in what was a pulsating encounter.

In fact, a great deal has changed at Easter Road in the 12 months since Pat Fenlon sat grim-faced in the aftermath of a League Cup quarter-final loss to Hearts, unable *not* to listen to the angry mob gathered outside Easter Road demanding his dismissal.

On Wednesday night, Fenlon’s successor’s successor - Alan Stubbs = saw his team applauded off the pitch at their home ground after exiting the same competition at the identical stage.

What’s changed for the better? Not the status of the club, a reluctant member of the Scottish Championship. Maybe it’s more about mood.

‘Yes, it is quite a contrast,’ admitted midfielder Scott Robertson. ‘But, ironically, that game against Hearts was probably one of our best performances last season – we just could not score.

‘The fans were right to vent their anger, we lost a derby, even if it was a good performance. Like you say, the fans were happy with our effort and performance level against United - because I don’t think you could have asked much more from any of the players that stepped out on the pitch.

‘The manager has tried to install a bit of devilment in us. Even if we do go behind in game we feel we have a way of finding a way back - we did it three times against United! The manager is trying to get a bit of nastiness about us and that’s been shown.’

If the Hibs players may take some time to recover, mentally and physically, in time they may look back on their performance with pride.

Robertson revealed: ‘One of the Dundee United players, Chris Erskine, said to me during the game: “This is the most enjoyable game I’ve played in all season”. That’s probably because it was so open, with lots of goals and chances, decisions for the referee - and obviously the penalty shoot-out at the end.

‘It was disappointing for us to be the losing team on penalties but it was definitely an entertaining game. We can agree on that.

‘Looking at the team we have now and the way we are playing, if we had that philosophy last season then I really do not think we would be in the position we are in now.

‘It is easy to say that. But, when you are playing against a team like Dundee United and matching them - probably more than matching them actually - then it shows how far we have come in a short space of time.

‘We know ourselves but I think we have to prove it to people how good we can be - and do it more consistently. But our last two performances against the opposition we have been playing against shows what we are capable of, it just needs to be on a more consistent basis.’
