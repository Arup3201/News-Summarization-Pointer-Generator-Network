One of two convicted bank robbers who fled a Chicago jail using knotted bed sheets has been captured following a police and federal manhunt.

Joseph "Jose" Banks was caught by agents and officers from the Chicago FBI Violent Crimes Task Force, and officers from the Chicago Police Department, around 11:30 p.m. Thursday.

Banks had been on the run with prison mate Kenneth Conley, 38, after the two escaped on Tuesday, descending a 20 story drop from a window of the Metropolitan Correctional Center.

The 37 year-old was captured by officers without incident. The two men had been on the run for hours before the escape was reported.

The men apparently descended from a thin window barely half a foot wide on the flat south side of the prison into the alley below. The wall faces a parking garage and is above air conditioning or heating units.

Crowds of people gathered outside the building where the ropes still blew in the breeze, shaking their heads in disbelief that someone could have escaped from a lockup in the heart of downtown Chicago, just a block or two from key federal court and office buildings.

The escape went unnoticed for hours, with surveillance video from a nearby street showing the two hopping into a cab shortly before 3 a.m. Tuesday. They were no longer wearing their orange jail-issued jumpsuits.

When the facility did discover the two men were gone, around 7 a.m., what was found revealed a meticulously planned escape, including clothing and sheets shaped to resemble a body under blankets on beds, bars inside a mattress and even fake bars in the cells.

A massive manhunt involving state, federal and local law enforcement agencies was launched, as SWAT teams stormed into the home of a relative of Conley, only to learn the two had been there but had left, and searched other area homes and businesses -- including a strip club where Conley once worked.

The owners of several small shops 
across the street from the wall said they didn't see any police activity
until around 8:30 a.m., when a dozen or more police cars and SWAT teams
rushed into the area. Some police officers sprinted for a nearby subway
entrance.

Banks, known as 
the Second-Hand Bandit because he wore used clothes during his heists, 
was convicted last week of robbing two banks and attempting to rob two 
others. Authorities say he stole almost $600,000, and most of that still
is missing.

Banks and Conley prepared meticulously for their escape and used hundreds of bedsheets to drop 20 stories to to the streets below

During trial, he had to be restrained because he threatened to walk out of the courtroom. He acted as his own attorney and verbally sparred with the prosecutor, at times arguing that U.S. law didn't apply to him because he was a sovereign citizen of a group that was above state and federal law.

Conley pleaded guilty last October to robbing a Homewood Bank last year of nearly $4,000. Conley, who worked at the time at a suburban strip club, wore a coat and tie when he robbed the bank and had a gun stuffed in his waistband.
