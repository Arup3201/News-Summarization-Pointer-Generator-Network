It certainly wasn't the Christmas surprise Hayley Crews was after.

The Portland resident returned home last week to discover that her boyfriend Roy Dufek had accidentally sold her pet tabby cat of five years.

Dufek was selling a bed via Craigslist on Crews' behalf in preparation for moving in together and didn't realize the feline was hiding inside the frame.

The piece of furniture was picked up by its new owner and transported roughly four miles away and the moggy hasn't been seen since.

Christmas catastrophe: Hayley Crews from Portland, Oregon, returned home last week to discover that her boyfriend Roy Dufek had accidentally sold her pet tabby cat named Camo, pictured 

Dufek swiftly put out pleas on Reddit and Craigslist for Camo to be returned with a $200 cash reward - the money he got for the bed.

'I messed up and sold my girlfriend's cat,' he wrote.

The 28-year-old continued: 'SO... My girlfriend and I are moving into a new apartment and while she was at work I helped her out by selling the two beds she had in her apartment.

'Little did I know when the cat is scared it hides inside the box spring.

Missing: The animal  traveled from Crews' apartment in Rock Creek to a home near Hillsboro Airport

Search and rescue: Dufek and Crews have appealed to locals to come forward with any information 

'As you can imagine my girlfriend is absolutely crushed. 

'I know some think 'it's just a cat' but if you've ever owned an animal I ask that you understand how unbelievably devastating this is.' 

The animal apparently traveled from Crews' apartment in Rock Creek to a home near Hillsboro Airport.

Dufek also got in touch with the man who purchased the beds to conduct a thorough search of his home  with no joy.

He said that the mattresses were strapped to the top of a car for transport so Camo could have jumped out mid-journey. 

Features: Camo has tabby markings with white paws and a white patch on his nose, he is also micro-chipped

He and his girlfriend are now appealing for anyone to come forward with information. 

'We would want to know, dead or alive what state he's in,' Dufek notes.

Camo has tabby markings with white paws and a white patch on his nose, he is also micro-chipped.

Despite the blunder, Crews still plans on moving in with Dufek according to Oregon Live.

The couple have returned to Phoenix, Arizona, to visit family for Christmas and hope that they will return on Saturday to some happy news.
