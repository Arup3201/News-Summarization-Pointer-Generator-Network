An enormous snail was discovered trying to slide past border control at Auckland airport.

Biosecurity officials intercepted the mollusc, which was carrying around six eggs, and prevented it from entering New Zealand.

Giant African land snails, which can weigh over 35lb and grow to eight inches in length, are known as a ravenous species, and can damage crop and forestry industries and even eat paint off the walls of buildings.

The animal was travelling with a couple returning from Madagascar, where the snails enjoy the optimal habitat for their enormous appetites. 

Ministry for Primary Industries clearance manager Craig Hughes said: 'At nearly 15cm long, it was the largest giant African snail many of our staff had ever seen.'

'When our inspector tapped the shell, a number of eggs fell out. We could have had a whole family take residence in Auckland if there hadn't been border controls in place.'

Hughes said the couple had found the snail in a forest.

'The good thing is they declared the snail on their arrival card, thereby alerting our inspector of the biosecurity risk,' he added. 

'They don't realise that the snail will often hibernate unseen at the tip of the shell and only emerge when conditions are favourable.'

Passengers have been known to declare giant African land snails as sea shells, as they often hibernate unseen inside their shells, only making an appearance when conditions are suitable for them.
