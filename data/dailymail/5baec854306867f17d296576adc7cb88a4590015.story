Rio Ferdinand insists the England team will remain behind the likes of Germany unless coaches stop holding back naturally talented players such as Wayne Rooney.

In an extract from his autobiography #2sides, the former England captain picks over the Three Lions' performance at the World Cup having been in Brazil as a pundit and witnessed their miserable campaign.

Ferdinand reckons the Germans, along with Holland and Spain, are streets ahead and the QPR defender pinpoints mistakes at grassroots level.

Rio Ferdinand wants to see talented young players given the freedom to develop naturally

Ferdinand was in Brazil working for the BBC as a pundit during the World Cup this summer

'We’ve got far too many coaches who tell talented young players how to play rather than letting them develop naturally,' said Ferdinand in the extract on his Facebook page. 

'All I heard on the sidelines when I was growing up was about hard work and tackling. A good tackle would be applauded as much, if not more, than a great bit of skill. Tackling is a great part of the game. But, for me, the skill factor overrides everything else. 

'The best players have the best skills because it’s something they’ve done all their lives in their own, original, unstructured ways.

'Look at Cristiano Ronaldo: unstructured street football as a kid. He just played and played because he loved to play. The Brazilian Ronaldo, Maradona, Wayne Rooney, Franck Ribery … all these guys are street footballers and originals who did things their way.

Wayne Rooney was cited as an example of pure, natural talent by his former Man United team-mate Ferdinand

Cristiano Ronaldo, another United old boy, is also mentioned by Ferdinand in his new book

'I’ve often spoken about this with Wayne and Cristiano. Wayne told me a few times how coaches wanted him to play in one position and he refused, saying, "No, I want to play here, because I’m the best and that’s what I’m doing."

'With guys like that, from a young age they’ve got their own ideas and they understand football and they know what they’re good at. Unfortunately, some coaches see that as a threat and won’t embrace it.'
