For four decades, he has negotiated obstacles placed in his way by foes and erstwhile friends alike.

But tonight, an emotional Ken Livingstone announced his retirement from frontline politics after he was defeated by Boris Johnson in the election for Mayor of London.

He said it would be his 'last election' and that he was 'sincerely sorry' he had failed to win for Londoners in 'the defeat I most regret'.

Mr Livingstone, 66, said: 'This is my last election. Forty one years ago, almost to the day, I won my first election promising to build good council housing and introduce a free bus pass for pensioners.

'Now I have lived long enough to get one myself. I did not think I necessary would at the time. Since then, I have won 11 more elections and lost three.

'But the one that I most regret 
losing is this. This is the defeat I most regret, because these are the 
worst times for 80 years and Londoners needed a mayor to help them get 
through this very difficult period.'

In a closely fought race, Mr Johnson garnered 1,054,811 votes (51.53 per cent) to Mr Livingstone's 992,273 (48.47 per cent).

But there is no denying that 'Red' Ken has had a good innings.

Way back in 1971, when he first stood for Lambeth Council, he proved the master of the dark arts of political manipulation, propaganda and campaigning.

Boris Johnson was re-elected as Mayor of London in a surprisingly narrow victory that saw him beat rival Ken Livingstone.

The
 Conservative polled 1,054,811 to the Labour's candidate's 992,273 
following a deeply personal and bitter campaign battle that saw the two 
men clash furiously in public and in private.

Mr
 Johnson vowed to continue 'fighting for a good deal for Londoners' from
 government as he thanked voters for giving him a 'new chance'.

The
 Mayor outperformed his party, which suffered a significant drubbing 
nationally, but failed to secure the massive win predicted by polls over
 recent days that had put him as far as 12 points ahead.

Early
 results in the contest also suggested the incumbent was significantly 
in the lead and even senior Labour figures conceded the Tory was poised 
to win.

But
 later count declarations saw the gap reduce, fuelling speculation Mr 
Johnson's victory was not the done deal that had been tipped.

No candidate won enough votes in the first round to secure victory, meaning second preferences had to be counted.

Labour
 secured eight of the London Assembly's 14 first-past-the-post 
constituencies, gaining two from the Tories, which left them with six.

In his most controversial years during the Eighties and Nineties, first as leader of the ultra-radical Greater London Council and then as a hard-left MP for Brent, he was untouchable at the ballot box.

Even when Tony Blair kicked him out 
of the Labour Party in a desperate bid to stop him becoming London mayor
 in 2000, Mr Livingstone still emerged triumphant having run as an 
independent.

Exactly four years ago, his political
 obituary was penned by many pundits after Mr Johnson dramatically 
brought to an end his eight-year reign at City 
Hall.

Reports of his demise
 proved as exaggerated as Mark Twain's: within two years, he had not 
only secured the Labour candidacy for a fourth tilt but appeared 
well-set to return in triumph.

But
 a seasoned campaigner famous for defying the odds has proved unable to 
win even when they were stacked in his favour - neither his personal nor
 political magic working on Londoners.

And now that door has firmly closed.

It
 is impossible to imagine Labour - the party which once begged him to 
return to the fold - will ever again invest in Mr Livingstone as the 
answer to its prayers in the capital.

As
 his campaign unravelled - in the main thanks to controversy over his 
personal taxes - high-profile Labour figures lined up to express regrets
 at his return and tell voters not to back him.

Such was the poisoned atmosphere that
 Labour election chief Tom Watson went so far as to say that voters 
should 'hold their noses' and vote for his own party's candidate.

That was a sentiment echoed by an eve-of-poll editorial in The Guardian.

In his heyday he was the left-wing thorn in the side of the Tories - Margaret Thatcher resorted to legislation to remove him in 1986 - as well as Tony Blair's Government which was so determined to exclude him that it stitched up the selection process, to disastrous effect.

Within two years of joining the Labour Party in 1969, Mr Livingstone was elected as a councillor in his native Lambeth in south London before joining the Greater London Council in 1974.

Soon notorious as 'Red' Ken, he became a bete noire of the Right, supporting everyone from striking miners to Sinn Fein's leaders at the height of the IRA's bombing campaign.

He famously goaded Mrs Thatcher across the Thames in Parliament during the turbulent 1980s by hanging a banner from County Hall with the unemployment figure on it.

After she secured revenge by abolishing the GLC, he joined the ranks of Labour's left wing MPs, harrying the Tories but also clashing frequently with the New Labour modernisers.

When Mr Blair restored devolved government to the capital - and created the powerful post of mayor - he certainly did not anticipate that it would open the door for his foe's return.

But his every attempt to prevent his worst-case scenario backfired - and such was Mr Livingstone's popularity that he was forced to ensure he was the official candidate in 2004.

During that second term, Mr Livingstone won widespread praise for the way he stood up for London after the July 2005 suicide bombings and helped win the 2012 Olympic Games for the capital.

There were a string of popular policies too - though tempered by the sorts of personal and professional controversies that have followed him throughout his career.

In 2005, he narrowly avoided serious punishment when he likened a Jewish reporter to a Nazi concentration camp guard - a theme that also dogged this most recent campaign.

A close aide was forced to quit over claims he misused public funds and Mr Livingstone's unusual private life, involving five children by three partners, was the subject of intense scrutiny.

Despite that - and the dismal opinion poll ratings of Gordon Brown's unpopular Labour government - he may have clung on but for an equally maverick and colourful opponent in Boris Johnson.

With the roles almost exactly reversed four years on, for some time it looked possible that Mr Livingstone could cut short the Tory's tenure.

But his momentum was dramatically arrested by a row over claims he set up his business affairs to avoid paying large sums in income tax - and his refusal to publish accounts in full.

A bitter personal battle between the two main rivals ensued - one which today's results demonstrate was won by the incumbent.

As he contemplates defeat, Mr Livingstone will be a spectator rather than a key participant for the London Olympics he helped secure.

And he looks destined to be a spectator too when the contenders next line up for the race for the mayoralty. Just don't expect him to be a quiet one.
