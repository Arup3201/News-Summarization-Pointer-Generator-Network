A Phoenix man starved his dog to death and sent a graphic image of the emaciated canine to an ex-girlfriend to try to win her back, authorities said Thursday.

Luis Moreno, 38, was arrested Wednesday after he turned over his pit bull terrier named Wiggles to animal control as a stray when the ex-girlfriend refused all advances, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said.

Moreno and his girlfriend adopted Wiggles in 2008, according to deputies. But by 2012, couple broke up, and Moreno kept Wiggles.

In the name of 'love': Luis Moreno, 38, starved to death his dog named Wiggles in an attempt to get back with his ex-girlfriend. Near the end of Wiggles' life, he sent this picture of the emaciated dog to his ex

Abuser: Moreno was arrested Wednesday and is facing both animal cruelty and domestic violence charges

He began calling and texting his ex-girlfriend, trying to reconcile and when his advances didn't work, Moreno resorted to using Wiggles as bait, deputies said.

Moreno at one point sent a text message that read: "Wiggles is dead, I hope your happy b**** [sic]," authorities said

The ploy worked and his ex called in concern for the dog, but he told her Wiggles was fine.

When that bid failed to get him a date, he sent yet another message to his ex saying the dog was sick.

She offered to help pay for medical treatment, but Moreno refused her offer - asking her out on a date instead.

Unsurprisingly, Moreno's ex turned him down again.

As a last-ditch effort, Moreno sent the woman a picture of Wiggles emaciated and lying on the ground.

'It is sick and bizarre what some people do to animals, how they use and abuse them' Sheriff Joe Arpaio said.

After giving up on any reconciliation with his ex, Moreno turned Wiggles over to animal control and said the dog was a stray.

Wiggles was in such bad shape that the dog had to be euthanized.

Moreno is facing domestic violence and animal cruelty charges.

It was not known if he had an attorney.
