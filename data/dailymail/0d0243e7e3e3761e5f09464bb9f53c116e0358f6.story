Nick Clegg today bet a Ukip candidate six pints that the Lib Dems would have many more MPs than Nigel Farage’s ‘pipsqueak’ party.

The Lib Dem leader dismissed Ukip’s ‘bluster, anger and brave talk’ ahead of May’s general election, despite being behind in the polls.

The Deputy Prime Minister has grown increasingly confidence that despite his slump in popularity nationally, the Lib Dem vote is holding up in the 57 seats where they already have an MP.

Nick Clegg was challenged on live radio by Ukip candidate Keith Fraser, who boasted his party would win more MPs than the Lib Dems

One poll this week put the Lib Dems on just 5 per cent, the lowest for 25 years, while Ukip were on 14 per cent.

However, the concentration of Lib Dem support in a few dozen seats means they are likely to hang on to many of them despite their national collapse.

By contrast, Ukip has built support across the country but party insiders admit it is unlikely even to get 10 MPs on May 7.

Mr Clegg made the provocative boast that he will win more MPs than Ukip during his weekly radio phone-in on LBC.

Ukip candidate Keith Fraser called into the programme to attack Mr Clegg’s stance on civil liberties and boast that the Lib Dems face wipeout.

But Mr Clegg hit back: ‘Rather than making slightly silly political points on the radio…

‘How about this, I will bet you, I don’t know, what shall I bet you, I will bet you several pints that the Liberal Democrats will have many, many, many, many, many more MPs than your party after the election.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage boasted his party would win more than 10 MPs and could hold the balance of power

‘I can not only bet, I can close to guarantee you that your party is going to be a little pipsqueak party after May 7 compared to the Liberal Democrats.

‘All your bluster, and all your anger and all your brave talk I think will dissolve.’

Mr Clegg initially appeared reluctant to commit his own money to the bet, but when LBC host Nick Ferrari offered to pay the money, Mr Clegg replied: Oh alright then, six pints.

‘Let me be absolutely clear Keith, you believe on behalf of Nigel Farage, that you Ukip will have more MPs than the Liberal Democrats after May 7, is that right?’

Keith replied: ‘I think there’s a very good chance of overtaking your party. Am I taking the bet? Two pints will go to each: if I lose, I’m buying Nick Ferrari two pints, I’m buying Nick Clegg two pints, how about that?’

But Mr Clegg insisted: ‘Bad luck Keith, you might as well set the money aside already. Brave talk.’

Later Mr Fraser told MailOnline: 'If I lose, or Ukip loses, I will be more than willing to buy Nick Clegg and Nick Ferrari a beer.

'In fact, after the election Nick Clegg will have plenty of time to have a beer.' 

However, Mr Farage later insisted his party was on course to win more than 10 seats and could hold the balance of power.

Appearing on ITV's Loose Women, he said: 'It'll be more than a handful. It'll be in double figures.'

He added: 'Ukip is not going to win the election. What Ukip is going to do is win a number of MPs.

'And given no-one is going to have a majority we might just find ourselves in a position where nick Clegg was five years ago if we do that I'll do a better job than Nick Clegg did.'
