Almost 300 people have been arrested in southern California after a month-long pedophile sting investigation.

Operation Broken Heart lead to 275 arrests, including a special needs teaching assistant, a retired sheriff's deputy and a U.S. Army soldier, according to investigators.

Officers posed as 12 to 14-year-olds online during the probe in scenes similar to TV show To Catch A Predator.

LA deputies have arested 275 alleged pedophiles, including a special needs teaching assistant who was caught after traveling to a meeting believing they were about to have sex with two children

The mission, in May, involved dozens of local, state and federal authorities  targeting sex offenders, child sex traffickers, pimps, child porn traders and sex tourists traveling abroad.

'The dirty old man stereotype no longer applies,' said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge of ICE Homeland Security Investigations, which works on the task force.

'The perpetrators in these cases come from all walks of life and virtually every strata of the socio-economic spectrum they're community leaders, white-collar professionals and even law enforcement personnel.

'The common denominator in most of these cases is the Internet. It has become the preferred playground for child sex predators.'

Officers arrested the teaching assistant after they allegedly showed up to a meeting believing they were going to have sex with two children.

The former LA County Sheriff's deputy was tracked down after allegedly distributing child porn over the internet, and the soldier was arrested while on leave after responding to two adverts offering underage sex.

Authorities emphasized the importance of educating youth about the dangers of the Internet and insisted that parents strictly supervise and are aware of their children's online activities.

'You lock your doors and windows every night to be able to keep predators out of your home,' said Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell.

The month-long To Catch A Predator-style investigation saw officers posing as children aged 12 to 14 online to ensnare potential pedophiles

'If your child is in the next room on the Internet, you may have a predator basically sitting virtually in the next room and you're giving that predator access.'

Of the arrested, California parole agents picked up 186 sex offenders for violating their terms of release.

Three were found in possession of child pornography, multiple found in places where they're barred such as parks, schools and children.

Of the 186 sex offenders arrested, 155 were sent back to court with recommendations to have their parole revoked.

Among the others arrested was a 64-year-old computer programmer was caught after allegedly traveling to a park to try to meet with a 15-year-old child for sex.

A search warrant for his home and business indicated he'd exchanged emails with multiple other children and had posted 100 advertisements looking for sex with young girls.

A former substitute teacher allegedly posted a personal ad seeking sex with a father and a son. He was arrested after allegedly traveling to meet with what he believed was an 8-year-old boy.

The number of arrests and potential allegations are expected to grow as forensic investigators continue analyzing seized evidence.

Law enforcement conducted the operations in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.
