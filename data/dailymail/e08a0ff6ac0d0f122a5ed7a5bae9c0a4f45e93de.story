Three-time Indianapolis 500 champion Dario Franchitti left the hospital Thursday after the horrific October 6 crash during the last lap of an Indycar race in Houston earlier this month that left him with multiple serious injuries.

The Scottish racer left the hospital in a wheelchair after multiple surgeries to repair the damage done when his race car went airborne at over 100 mph into the safety fencing and causing it to spin several times against the fence, firing debris into the grandstands and injuring 13 spectators.

Mr Franchitti, 40, suffered a concussion, two spinal fractures and a fractured right ankle. He was permitted to leave Thursday after a second surgery to fix the ankle, according to reports.

The driver is determined to return to racing next season, sources told the Indianapolis Star.

Seen smiling in a recent picture, the recovering racer has become more active on Twitter in recent days, perhaps evidence he is returning to normal.

The Scot has tweeted multiple times about how grateful he is for the support, how overwhelming it is to hear from well-wishers. He also took time to thank everyone who took care of him at both the track and the hospital.

The Chip Ganassi Racing team star has also made time to comment about the death of another driver.

'Was woken for my pain pills and saw the incredibly sad news out of Australia about Porsche driver Sean Edwards. Rest in peace Sean,' Mr Franchitti tweeted Tuesday.

Mr Franchitti also tweeted in remembrance of Dan Wheldon, a fellow driver who died in 2011 after an accident as Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

The racer is recovering in his Indianapolis home and plans to return to racing next season, according to the Star. Alex Tagliani is driving his number 10 car for the remainder of the season, the paper noted.

was seen on television cameras to be moving in the aftermath of the 
crash as safety stewards dashed to offer assistance and his team owner 
Chip Ganassi said Franchitti was 'awake and alert' in the helicopter on 
the way to hospital and had injured his ankle and back.

Senior
Captain Ruy Lozana of the Houston Fire Department said that two of the 
13 spectators were sent to hospital while the rest were fine to be 
treated at the scene.

Franchitti was taken to a hospital near Reliant Park in Houston to be treated.

The Scotsman was stretchered off the track and taken by ambulance to the nearby Houston hospital.

Race officials said Franchitti was 'awake and alert' but did not go into details on his injuries.

The three-car smash happened in one of the sharp turns and also involved Japan's Takuma Sato and E.J. Viso of Venezuela but both the drivers were able to leave their cars and walk away.

Debris from the crash also flew over the top of the safety fencing, injury some spectators.

Race officials did not immediately provide details of those injuries.

The race was won by Australia's Will Power.

The incident caused victory celebrations for Power to be muted as he hoped that Franchitti was alright.

'It just looked bad, I hate seeing that,' Power said. 'I just hope he’s OK…But it was a very good day on the track. 'We were able to help Helio out a bit in the championship, and I just hope Dario is alright.'

'Everybody hopes Dario is OK,' said New Zealand driver Scott Dixon.

Sato said that his car clipped the wall before triple-Indy 500 champion Franchitti's car collided with his.

'On the last lap I caught the marbles and brushed the wall and lost 
momentum,' Sato said to the LA Times. 'A couple cars passed me as I was off line and in 
Turn 5. I got very loose and Dario and I came together. Hopefully Dario 
is OK.'

The way they were: The actress was a regular fixture on the race car circuit as she supported her husband, seen here with their furry 'children' in May 2010 at the 94th Indianapolis 500 Trophy Presentation

In January, it was announced that Franchitti was splitting from actress Ashley Judd, his wife of 13-years.

The 44-year-old U.S. actress and the Scottish racing driver, 39, announced they were ending their marriage in a joint statement on Tuesday.

They told People.com at the time: 'We have mutually decided to end our marriage.

'We'll always be family and continue to cherish our relationship based on the special love, integrity, and respect we have always enjoyed.'

A spokesman for the actress subsequently confirmed the news to MailOnline when asked for comment, stressing their decision to split was a mutual one, not one-sided.

The Missing actress tied the knot in December 2001 in Scotland in a private ceremony.
