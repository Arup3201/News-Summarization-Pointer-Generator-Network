They say records are made to be broken, and unsurprisingly, attempts to surf the world's biggest waves are no exception.

A group of daredevils have faced off with the giant waves at the Praia do Norte beach in Nazare, Portugal, where Garrett McNamara set a world record in 2011 for the largest wave ever surfed.

Photos of yesterday's remarkable attempts to surf the site show riders being dwarfed by the waves as walls of water crash down behind them.

The surf is best in the winter when Atlantic winds pick up, creating giant waves along the Portugal coast north of Lisbon. Pictured yesterday is a surfer dropping straight down the face of a wave

The break has become a shrine for big wave surfers ever since McNamara set a world record three years ago by surfing a 78ft wave from trough to crest.

The waves are formed when a 125-mile long underwater canyon up to three miles deep combines with strong Atlantic currents.

In the peak summer months, the beaches of Nazare attract thousands of sun-seekers, but the scene transforms in the autumn and winter, as the Atlantic winds pick up, causing the waves to grow in size and power.

The wild seas can prove dangerous though - local emergency services have had to rescue surfers knocked unconscious by the crashing waves in the past.

The area attracts surfers from all around the world at this time of year, with some travelling from as far away as Australia and Hawaii to enjoy the giant waves.

Two months ago a big swell brought another set of huge waves to the area. Pictured is a surfer coasting down the face of a wave on September 14
