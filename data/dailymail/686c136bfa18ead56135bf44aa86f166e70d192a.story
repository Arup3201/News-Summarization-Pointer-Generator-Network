A pawnbroker who weighed more than 25 stone was motivated to shed half her body weight after being told she was too fat to complete her lifelong ambition of skydiving.

Debbie Allmark, 35, from Biddulph, Staffordshire, tipped the scales at 26 stone at her heaviest and her weight was damaging her health.

She said: 'I couldn't see a light at the end of the tunnel and I didn't feel like I wanted to carry on. I was so embarrassed and felt humiliated - my confidence was so low.'

At her heaviest, Debbie tipped the scales at 26 stone. Now, less than two years later, she has slimmed down to a much healthier 13st 1lb

In 2013, Debbie was so heavy that on a family holiday to Disneyland in Florida, she was banned from some of the rides because of her size.

A year earlier, the mother-of-two was left humiliated after a roller coaster at Alton Towers Resort in the Midlands stopped while she was on it.

She said: 'We were at Alton Towers in the summer of 2012. The ride got stopped as my bars were not locked. I was too big and had to leave the ride. It was humiliating.'

She added: 'The ride made me more humiliated and devastated about my weight. That was a huge catalyst.'

Debbie has always dreamed of skydiving, but was told that 13st was the maximum weight to take part

But the biggest game changer for Debbie, who is mother to Bradley, 14, and Connor, 11, was when her excess weight stopped her from following her dreams. 

She said: 'I'd always wanted to do a skydive. It was my life ambition to do one. But when I looked into it, I found out you need to be up to 13 stone to take part. 

'I was devastated.'

It was then that Debbie finally decided to battle her weight problems.  

After her GP prescribed her with a gym membership, Debbie started to rapidly shed body fat. 

She has now lost 13 stone in less than two years and now tipped the scales at 13st 1lb.

She said: 'This is not the end, I feel a lot healthier and I have more energy.

'My confidence has tripled and I can now play with my kids and enjoy myself more. It has given me another life.

'The support from my family has been great as well. They have been a massive part of it. I don't think I would have been able to do it without my boys.'

Debbie's weight loss was thanks in part to a new gym membership prescribed to her by her GP

After reaching the acceptable weight, Debbie has booked her skydive for May 16

After reaching the acceptable weight, Debbie has now booked her skydive and has chosen to donate the proceeds to the North Staffordshire Heart Committee, which provided care for her mother Lilian Lovatt, who passed away in 2009 from heart failure at the age of 66.

The event will take place on May 16, just three days before what would have been her mother's birthday.

Debbie said: 'The heart ward was brilliant in caring for her, so the money I raise will go straight to them and hopefully help other families,' she said.

'I'll be thinking of her throughout the whole flight. But at the moment, when I stretch out my arms, I know she'll be there under me.

'She'll be my wings and I know she would be proud of what I've done.'

Debbie's sister Dawn Adey, 47, from Brindley Ford, Stoke-on-Trent, says her sibling is as an inspiration to everyone.

She said: 'It is such a fantastic achievement. We're all really proud of her and she has been an inspiration to the whole family.

'At her lowest points, she kept saying she couldn't do it, but we all encouraged her to get off the settee and get moving.

'At first she just started walking, but then she began doing more and more.

'I love her so much and it is amazing she is now doing a skydive. Mum cared for all of us and it means a lot to us that Debbie is doing this with her in mind.'
