Stopping off at a motorway services station is usually an unpleasant experience of greasy burgers, long toilet queues and toxic coffee.

Unless, that is, you happen to be at Tebay Services in Westmorland, Cumbria.

With its dark wood beams, cafe that looks out over a picturesque duck pond and stock of quails' eggs and organic beer in the adjacent farm shop, it's fair to say Tebay is not your average stop-off.

Now it has become the first service station in Britain to be awarded five stars following a survey by the Highways Agency and VisitEngland.

Not your average stop-off: Tebay Services on the M6 in Cumbria is the first to be awarded a five star rating from Visit England

Proud moment: Services chief executive Sarah Dunning her staff show off their award

The services opened for business 40 years ago after growing out of the Dunning family's farm by the northbound M6. It now employs 500 staff.

Its restaurant, open daily from 7.15am to 9pm, serves homemade food and even has an outdoor BBQ where staff flip burgers and sausages made from locally sourced meat to the delight of the weary motorist.

In the adjacent farm shop, shelves groan with organic veg, locally sources jams, cheese and locally grown wines. There's also a butcher's counter that stocks Galloway Beef from nearby farms.

The Highways Agency has strict rules about motorway service stations: they must not become destinations in their own rights.

Grand: Tebay Services grew out of the family farm and opened for buisness 40 years ago

Beautiful setting: Ms Dunning said the services was a popular stopping point for traffic travelling between England and Scotland

Tebay chief executive Sarah Dunning told The Guardian: 'We are a stopping point for traffic travelling between England and Scotland. It is really cool being the only service station out of the 100 odd motorway services areas on the network to get five stars.'

Over the past year a team of six assessors from VisitEngland have conducted three mystery visits to all 107 service stations on the motorway network.

During the two-hour visit they looked at cleanliness, car parking, security and safety, lighting, facilities for children, dogs and disabled people and for coaches, caravans and lorries.

Spot of shopping: The service station also boasts a farm shop and butcher's counter

Artisan: The shop sells locally sourced jams and locally grown wines as well as a range of organic vegetables

They also assessed the toilets, food and overall experience and asked staff questions such as: 'Cottage pie - is that made from lamb or beef?'

Seventy service stations were awarded three stars, 11 got two stars and 25 received four stars.

In 2006, Tebay was voted best motorway services in Britain by Which? Magazine. In 2009 it won the Grand Prix of gastronomy from Egon Ronay.

Those living further south are in luck as the Dunning family are planning another service station near Gloucester.
