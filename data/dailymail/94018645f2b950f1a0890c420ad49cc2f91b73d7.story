A six-year-old Oregon girl who had been reported missing Saturday afternoon by her mother was home safe early Sunday after authorities found her at a Howard Johnson hotel.

Carmen Alexandria Welch was reported missing by her mother, Sara Lea Edmond, 30, Saturday, sparking an intense investigation that involved both local authorities and the FBI.

But Edmond was today arrested after authorities allege that she presented false information to police regarding her daughter’s disappearance.

Safe: Carmen Alexandria Welch, a six-year old Oregon girl reported missing Saturday afternoon, was found early today and returned to her father

Record: Sara Lea Edmond, 30, now faces various charges

According to the Oregonian, Edmond called Gresham police to report that Carmen was missing Saturday afternoon.

As hours passed, local police brought in the Special Investigations Unit, the Portland Police K9 unit, as well as FBI officers.

By 2:40am PST, authorities found Carmen and her mother at a Howard Johnson Hotel.

The girl was unharmed and returned to her father, Marc Welch.

Her mother was then taken into custody and charged with several offenses, including criminal mistreatment, child neglect, custodial interference, and filing a false report.

It remains unclear why Edmond allegedly lied to authorities over her daughter’s disappearance.

Authorities are now launching an investigation into Edmond’s odd behavior.

According to KXL, police believe the false report stemmed from a bitter custody battle Edmond is in with Welch’s father.

State records show that this is Edmond's first brush with the law.

Found: Carmen and her mother were found at a nearby Howard Johnson hotel this morning, and Edmond was taken into custody
