Top scientists are designing a self-controlled navigation system that will pilot the next Mars Rover - an artificially intelligent 'sat nav' that will drive the hi-tech vehicle.

Except, of course, on Mars, there are no GPS satellites to guide it - so it will be smart enough to do the whole thing itself.

It should speed up the vehicle immensely - sending a radio signal to Mars to control a vehicle takes more than half an hour.

Independent: The new navigation system will allow a Mars Rover to find its way around the Red Planet all by itself

Since the 'Seeker' navigation system will save so much time, it will allow a rover to find its way around the Red Planet - covering at least one kilometre a day.

The system will perform a range of key actions completely unaided by Mission Control or GPS-type technology including: working out the precise location of the rover on Mars, identifying particular sites to visit on the planet and detecting and avoiding hazards.

It will also be able to navigate its way back to previously visited sites.

It will take the team of experts from Britain, France, and Canada seven months to complete the project, which is part of  the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) 
StarTiger initiative, which tackles space-related challenges.

Early developments of the system were unveiled by the team based at the Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC) in Swindon at STFC's 7th Appleton Space conference today.

The event organised by RAL Space sees 
leading experts from across the globe sharing the very latest 
developments in current and future space 
exploration.

Project director, Kim Ward of RAL Space said: 'The keys to Seeker’s success will be imagination, application and team work.

'With radio signals to conventional rovers taking at least 30 minutes to travel between Earth and Mars, Seeker’s ability to work autonomously in hostile terrain will be crucial to extending our understanding of our planetary neighbour.'

David Willetts, Minister of State for Universities and Science, said: 'Space captures the imagination of so many people, and it’s excellent to see UK experts playing such a significant role in the groundbreaking StarTiger initiative.

'The Seeker project has the potential to transform our exploration of Mars and make an important contribution to the international body of knowledge on the universe around us.'

The Seeker team includes experts from STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space, IT developer SciSys, global defence and security company BAe Systems, and electronics engineering company Roke Manor Research - all in Britain.

Scientists from LAAS, the leading research unit specialising in information science and technologies in France and MDA Space & Robotics in Canada also form part of the team.
