Miraculous: A mother declared clinically dead in October after suffering a brain hemorrhage has given birth to a baby boy in Milan

A mother declared clinically dead in October after suffering a brain hemorrhage has given birth to a baby boy nine weeks after doctors agreed to keep her on a life support machine to save the child.

The 36-year-old woman, who has not been named, was 23 weeks pregnant when she was rushed to Milan's San Raffaele hospital.

Tragically doctors were unable to save her life.

But they agreed to keep her alive with equipment to control her breathing and maintain her blood flow - while a tube to her intestines fed the growing fetus.

When the woman reached the 32nd week of pregnancy yesterday, doctors performed a cesarean section, La Stampa reported.

The baby boy was born weighing 1.8 kilos and in good health, The Local reports. 

A medic at the hospital said: 'Behind this joy, we can't forget the pain the family is feeling over the loss of this young woman.'

Although it is rare, the astonishing procedure has succeeded in the past.

In 1993, a baby boy was born more than three months after his mother was shot dead in the US.

Trisha Marshall, of California, was just 17 weeks pregnant when she was killed in a botched robbery attempt after trying to threaten an armed amputee with a meat cleaver.   

Doctors kept the fetus alive for more than 100 days in her womb before disconnecting her ventilator after succesfully delivering the baby, The Baltimore Sun reports.

In a similar case in Ireland this week, a pregnant woman, who has also been pronounced clinically dead, is being kept on life support, but against the wishes of her family, according to the Irish Independent.

Doctors have so far refused to back down due to a ruling that gives the rights of mothers and their unborn children the same status. 

The woman had suffered a catastrophic internal injury resulting from a blood clot and was transferred to a specialist unit in Dublin - but doctors were unable to revive her.

She was then taken back to the hospital she was first admitted to, which is now understood to be seeking legal advice on whether it can grant the parent’s request and turn her life-support machine off.

Sources quoted by Irish media say the woman’s parents are also now considering mounting a legal challenge - against the decision not to switch off life-support.

If the case proceeds to court, the state would be required to provide representation for the foetus
