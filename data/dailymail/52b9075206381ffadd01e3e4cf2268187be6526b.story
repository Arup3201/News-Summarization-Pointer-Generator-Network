A parody web series has attempted to answer the age-old question for visitors Down Under - how to talk Australian?

Students at an Indian call centre training college learn how to talk true-blue Aussie - with a hilarious emphasis on expletives and put-downs - in the Youtube comedy series.

The first episode, created by Australian film director Tony Rogers and writer Rob Hibbert, opens with the line: 'G'day Gibbo, how you going? You long piece of pelican s**t?'

Maharji, nicknamed Davo, is cooking up some steak on the barbie and using a boomerang as a utensil as he talks to his mate Rajiv 'Gibbo' on the phone.

'Not bad, you dumb a** s**t for brains sheep sh***r,' Rajiv replies.

'Get stuffed you dole-bludging p***ant,' Maharji fires back.

The satirical take on Aussie life continues at the Delhi college of linguistics, where there is a giant Skippy the kangaroo in the hallway and students are learning apparent language staples such as 'up the duff', 'chunder' and 'grouse'.

'Learning Australians is not easy, they really are a funny bunch of people - or should I say d***heads,' Professor Dilip explains.

How to keep your beer cold: Four students learn how to keep their beers the right temperature... by pouring them out into an esky

Four students master how to keep their beers cold... by pouring them out into the Esky, while a teacher goes on to explain: '30 per cent of Australians are casual racists... which means 70 per cent are full-time.'

Later one student queries why baby kangaroos are called Joey.

'All the babies are called Joey?... that's stupid. Why does baby get a name and mother does not? What if little Joey grows up to be a woman?,' he says.

The first episode is called 'G'day Knackers' and there are seven more in the series, showing Indian teachers dissecting the Australian national identity and attempt impersonations of famous Australians.

Comments on the How To Talk Australians YouTube channel are largely positive, with one viewer writing: 'GOLD!!! bloody ripper﻿.' Another said: 'haha I live in Perth and all your videos are hilarious'.

However, some viewers have complained the videos are 'racist'. Lucas Mitican defended them saying: 'This is hilarious, some could complain about it being racist to Aussies but the sheer fact that you know so much about the older Australian culture to make jokes is fantastic.﻿'

Another fan said: 'This is easily some of the best comedy I've seen in my life, this isn't racism, it's just social observation. Thanks for pointing out all the faults in my culture. You guys are a money bunny [funny].﻿'

'Mining the depths of every aspect of the Australian stereotype, the eight-part series presents us with a unique outsider’s perspective, and asks us to visit that most Australian trait: to laugh at ourselves,' the blurb for the series explains.
