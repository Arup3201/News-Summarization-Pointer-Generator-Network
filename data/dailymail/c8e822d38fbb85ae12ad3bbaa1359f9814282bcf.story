An aristocrat has won a libel payout from his local council after it published a neighbour’s letter falsely claiming he beat his ex-girlfriend.

Baronet Sir Benjamin Slade submitted plans to Sedgemoor District Council to host an electronic music festival at his sprawling 13th century Maunsel House.

But he was stunned when a letter of objection to the plans from a neighbour was published in full online – stating he had been ‘criminally violent’ to his former partner.

It referred to Sir Benjamin’s ex, the
actress Kirsten Hughes, who left the nobleman last year after ‘running 
off with the handyman’.

It was written by Sir Benjamin’s neighbour Sandy Evans as part of his objection to the planned Waveform Festival.

The council published the letter on 
its website’s temporary event notices section without contacting Sir 
Benjamin or checking the claims.

He has now won a ‘very substantial’ 
sum following nine months of legal wrangling.

He instructed leading 
London firm Carter Ruck to act against Mr Evans, who paid costs and 
admitted his claims were unfounded, and then the council.

Sir Benjamin said he had been left 
‘horrified’ by the allegations, which had affected his business renting 
out grounds for weddings and events.

He said: ‘The allegations were 
totally untrue. The council published it word for word online without 
checking a thing.

You just don’t do that.

I can’t believe anyone could 
be so stupid.

It had no relevance at all to planning.

‘I have had a terrible time because 
my former partner had a three-and-a-half year affair with the handyman 
before she scarpered with him.

‘People took sides and there was a 
lot said that was simply not true.

These things were said and then they 
were published.

Anyone reading a council website would think it was 
true, it is official.

'That has been very damaging for me. People didn’t want to do business with me.’

Mr Evans, the High Sheriff of  
Somerset in 2004, and a former director of charities including the 
Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance, wrote to the council last April to 
object to the festival.

The letter was published in full on 
the council’s website but was quickly taken down following contact from 
Sir Benjamin’s lawyers.

Waveform Festival, which lasted three days, eventually went ahead in August at Sir Benjamin’s 2,000-acre property.

A letter of apology by Mr Evans was 
published on the council’s website. It said: ‘I fully accept these 
allegations are not true and that Sir Benjamin has never used or 
authorised the use of any violence towards his ex-girlfriend. I accept 
entirely that there was no threat to public safety arising from the 
conduct of Sir Benjamin.’

Sedgemoor District Council has also 
apologised. A spokesman said the exact total, which will be covered by 
insurers, had not been finalised, adding: ‘The council accepts it should
not have published the allegations.’

Mr Evans declined to comment.

Sir Benjamin has just received a 'very substantial' sum totalling 'many, many thousands of pounds' following nine months of legal wrangling
