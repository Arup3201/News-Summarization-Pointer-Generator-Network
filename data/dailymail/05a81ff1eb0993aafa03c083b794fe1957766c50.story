A jewellery brand has unveiled their latest limited edition iPhone collection, decorated with the face of Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Caviar phones, a Russian-Italian company specializing in bespoke iPhones, have designed a gold iPhone 6 called Supremo Putin II, which will set Putin-fans back £2,300.

If you are a bit strapped for cash, no need to worry, there is a titanium version called Ti Supremo Putin ('Putin, you are supreme') for just £1,850.

For his biggest fans: The limited edition Supremo Putin II iPhone 6 is available in Russia at a cost of £2,300

Despite the unusual choice of decoration - and the jaw-dropping price tag - previous models from the Putinphone collections have sold out in record time.

The iPhone 5 Supremo Putin, a limited edition design of which only 144 were made,  retailed at £2,730 and was gone within days of its release in June this year. 

The phones are designed by jewellery film Perla Penna for Caviar phones, and are only available in Russia.

The Putinphones come in gold and titanium, the latter because 'it is he hardest, most pure metal in the world [reflecting the] indomitable force, unyielding will and steadfastness of Russia's leader'.

Originally set out to produce a limited collection of 299 Supremo Putin II, Perla Penna and Caviar suspended production of the iPhone 6 design after protests from Putin's camp.

Golden boy: The phone has been decorated with Putin's face, Russian Federation's crest and the first two lines of the national anthem, and also comes in titanium, called Ti Supremo Putin - 'Putin, you are supreme'

That Crimea feeling: Caviar Phones tell prospective buyers of the Putinphone that they can expect 'priority service' when flashing the gadget in a bar as 'the worried international community sees the Russian president as an aggressive figure ready to take drastic steps'

Super limited edition: Originally set out to produce a limited collection of 299 Supremo Putin II, production of the iPhone 6 design was suspended after protests from Putin's camp, and only just over 100 were made 

Nyet: The President himself  does not approve of the Putinphones but will not do anything about it

The Russian president's press secretary Dmitry Peskov announced on Monday that Putin is 'negative' to the use of his image for commercial use, and despite adding that the President will not do anything to stop the Putinphones, Perla Penna and Caviar were quick to suspend production.

'After learning about the president’s discontent with the use of his portrait, we immediately ceased the production of the Caviar Supremo Putin II [Putinphone],' Caviar’s press secretary, Anna Lobova, told Russian newspaper Izvestia.

'Though we planned to manufacture 299 items, there will be no more phones made and those already produced will be the only ones.'

However, as now only just over 100 Supremo Putin II iPhone 6 have been made, the item is expected to gain even more popularity among the richest of Putin's fans.

The company has even used Russia's recent actions in Ukraine to promote the Putinphones, claiming that the world's fear of Putin will be transferred to the owner of the device.

'Place a phone with a picture of Putin on it on a bar counter somewhere in Nice or Monte Carlo, and you can expect to get priority service,' a Perla Penna press release on the iPhone 5 collection claims.

'The worried international community sees the Russian president as an embodiment of power, robustness and strength, an uncompromising and aggressive figure ready to take drastic steps'.
