Aga has announced a £4 million increase in profits over the past 12 months due to its popularity 

The were once the preserve of middle-class housewives across rural Britain.

But the Aga - the quintessentially British oven - has become a sought-after status symbol among China’s burgeoning middle-classes.

As their maker, Aga Rangemaster, prepares to sell its first cookers in China this autumn, analysts said they had become akin to owning ‘a BMW or a Mercedes’ in the far-east.

It comes as the firm, which was badly-affected by the financial crisis, announced sales were up 3.3 per cent for the first half of the year, with a 10 per cent rise in the UK.

The cast-iron cooker maker recorded revenues of £124million this year, compared to £120million in 2013.

Helal Miah, an investment research analyst at The Share Centre, said: ‘There are more and more middle-class consumers in China and, just like they want BMWs and Mercedes, they are also looking for other prestigious consumer items – and the Aga is one of them.’

The Aga for the Chinese market will include a hob on the top which can be used to cook food in a wok.

A spokeswoman for the firm said: ‘We noticed that cooking trends in China were really changing.

‘It used to be that most cooking was traditionally done in a wok, but baking is now becoming more and more popular over there.

‘The radiant heat you get from an Aga rather than a fan oven gives a more even result when baking and the consumers have responded to that.’

Currently, Chinese customers must order the cooker from Aga in the UK or from a number of other overseas suppliers. But from the autumn, Chinese customers will be able to buy their cookers through a local firm supplied by Aga.

The Leamington Spa-based group said the appetite for the kitchen appliance was growing, despite uncertainties around interest rates and the mortgage market.

Analysts attributed the bumper sales to the strong housing market in the UK in recent months.

The latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders found 171,000 loans for house purchases were approved in the second quarter of 2014, up by 17 per cent on a year ago.

Mr Miah said: ‘Agas are back in the kitchen.

‘When we look at the results, we have seen a huge improvement, especially in the UK, where the housing market is continuing to do well.

‘I know salaries are not up, but consumer confidence is good. If people are feeling confident that they will hold on to their jobs, it helps when it comes to forking out quite a bit of money on a high-end cooker.

‘Aga was fairly battered by the housing crisis but things are looking up.’

The company still reported a loss of £300,000 during the first half of the year, although this was an improvement on £2.4million in 2013.

The cast iron cookers have been a firm favourite with the middle classes in England for decades
