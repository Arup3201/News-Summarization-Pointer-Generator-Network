President Obama said Wednesday that he has 'complete confidence' in Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, just hours after she took a beating during a congressional hearing over the disastrous Obamacare website.

His defense of Sebelius came after she was forced to concede on Capitol Hill that Obama, not she, was ultimately responsible for the Affordable Care Act's rocky launch.

'The president has complete 
confidence 
in Secretary Sebelius,' White House Deputy Press Secretary Joshua 
Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to the president's speech in Boston, where he offered full-throated oratory on the importance of his signature health insurance overhaul.

Earnest focused on Sebelius' early apology rather than on her later concession that the buck stops in the Oval Office.

She 'took responsibility for many of the problems that are
evident with the website, but she also deserves credit for the other 
aspects of the Affordable Care Act implementation that have gone well,' he said.

The embattled face of the health insurance overhaul law and 
its disastrous Internet enrollment platform had said in her opening statement, 'You deserve better. I apologize.'

But later during her testimony Wednesday before the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, Sebelius was muscled into sharing 
blame for the glitch-prone rollout with her boss in the White House.

Mississippi
Republican Rep. Gregg Harper pressed her on who is ultimately to blame 
for a website that wasn't adequately tested before its October 1 launch,
and crashed Wednesday morning, rendering it out of service during most 
of Sebelius' 3-1/2 hour grilling.

'The
president ultimately is responsible,' Harper insisted. 'While I think 
it’s great that you’re a team player and you’re taking responsibility, 
it is the president’s ultimate responsibility, correct?'

'Uh, whatever,' she sniped while shaking her head. 'Yes, he is the president. He is responsible for government programs.'

Less than five hours later, Obama proudly drew parallels between his Obamacare program and former Gov. Romney's, begun seven years ago in Boston.

'There were early problems to solve,' when Romney reformed health insurance programs there, he said, just as his program's rollout has been plagued with poor management, technical failures and organizational snafus.

'There were changes that had to be made.'

And of his own program, he admitted, 'The web site is too slow, too many people have gotten stuck and I'm not happy about it.'

Obama recalled happily how 36,000 Massachussets citizens signed up for Romney care in the first year, a pace that would leave Obamacare short by millions of taxpayers

'Enrollment was extremely slow,' Obama recalled of Romney's experiment in government management of the insurance market.

'Within a month only about a hundred people had signed up. ... by the end of the year, 36,000 people had signed up.'

Massachusetts comprises 2.1 per cent of the American population; at the same rate, the Obamacare program would only have 1.7 million new insurance enrollees by October 1, 2014.

Administration officials have said they need 7 million to sign up – more than four times as many – in order for the Affordable Care Act's books to balance as its strains to cover health care costs of the elderly and chronically ill.

Still, Obama claimed of Massachusetts, 'The vast majority of its citizens are happy with their coverage.'

'I'm confident this plan will work because the Massachusetts model has shown that it works,' he said repeatedly to wild applause from an estimated 800 partisans.

Obama was interrupted twice by 
screaming protesters upset about the construction of the Keystone XL 
pipeline. 'That is the wrong rally,' he quipped, saying 'we had the 
climate change rally back in the summer.'

Responding to complaints that insurers are dropping millions of Americans from their coverage, he declared that those policies were 'cut-rate plans' sold by 'bad apple insurers' who weren't offering benefits in line with what the Obamacare law requires.

His GOP opponents have highlighted dozens of examples of constituents receiving cancellation letters, many of which cite the Affordable Care Act as the reason policies are being discontinued.

One member of Congress brought his own such letter to a hearing on Wednesday.

But 'Americans would be better off,' Obama jabbed, if Republicans put as much energy into helping the Affordable Care Act succeed nationally as they put into criticizing it.

Romneycare is a statewide plan, 
instituted by Obama's one-time Republican election foe Mitt Romney when he was 
governor of Massachusetts, that formed part of the template the 
president used when his team formulated the Affordable Care Act.

The hearing was rife with stories 
about taxpayers who have lost their medical coverage because of new 
requirements forced on insurance companies by the Obamacare law, and 
included a contentious exchange in which Sebelius said she wouldn't – or
couldn't – buy health insurance through the government's insurance 
exchanges herself.

'Why aren't you losing your insurance?” Colorado Republican Rep. Cory Gardne demanded. 'Why won’t you go into this exchange?'

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius apologized to a congressional committee for wasting Americans' time as they tried and failed to use the crippled Obamacare website

The most hated woman in America? Sebelius is staying put, said Obama's aide, despite the woeful performance of the program she's leading

'I think it’s illegal for me,' she replied, citing the employer-sponsored insurance she already enjoys as a federal government employee.

She later said she would 'gladly join the exchange' if she weren't already covered.

'You can decide to drop the coverage from your employer,' Gardner insisted. 'You have the choice to decide not to choose [it].'

Healthcare.gov – when it's up and running – advises people in Sebelius' position, however, that 'f you’d like to explore Marketplace coverage options you can.' She would, however, be required to forgo taxpayers' contribution toward her coverage.

As a 65-year-old who is enrolled in 
Medicare Part A, Sebelius could also reject that coverage if she chose to, 
relying solely on exchange-driven insurance as millions of Americans are
contemplating as they find policy cancellation notices in their 
mailboxes.

That, though, would be a symbolic and impractical choice.

Obama will follow his health insurance speech with an appearance at a Democratic fundraiser on Wednesday night, but will return to Washington without seeing the sixth game of the World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals.

The president, Earnest reminded reporters, is a Chicago White Sox fan.

'I am well aware that a presidential visit is not the biggest thing going on today in Boston,' the president said during his speech. 'I promise we will be done here in time for everybody here to head over to Fenway.'
