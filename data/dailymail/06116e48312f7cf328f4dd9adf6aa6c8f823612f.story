Sacked: Margaret Rowe, 65, claims she lost her £184,000 a year job and objected to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife

A City lawyer who objected to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife to staff claims she lost her £184,000 a year job at ‘chauvinistic’ Fidelity Worldwide Investment because she refused to act like a woman who ‘knows her place’, a tribunal heard yesterday.

Margaret Rowe, 65, objected when Fidelity’s head of portfolio management James Bateman showed junior women colleagues photographs of the full-frontal painting of his wife, Cambridge don Dr Victoria Bateman.

The asset management firm says there was nothing prurient about the portrait of the Gonville and Caius College economist, which was featured in an exhibition.

But Miss Rowe told the Central London employment tribunal: ‘Many people found the picture awkward. The women did not know how to react or not to react. 

'It is unusual for a male boss to send to women on his staff a nude portrait with no context.’

Fidelity insists the almost life-size painting – which received publicity when it was shown at London’s Mall Galleries last year – was meant as a ‘challenge against the objectification of women’.

Miss Rowe denies suggestions by the firm that she was too aggressive and was always looking for issues to complain about.

‘Some of the men in the office could not countenance the fact I was a woman who was assertive and forthright,’ said Miss Rowe, who is claiming unfair dismissal and sex discrimination. 

‘They ignored or tolerated male behaviour which could perhaps be described as blameworthy.

‘I was seen as a woman who did not know her place. The culture was chauvinistic.

‘The senior management team was overwhelmingly male. It was deeply hierarchical and highly respectful of authority. 

'When I thought something was important I would raise it, I couldn’t fall into line regardless of the hierarchy.

‘I was forthright while being caring and considerate of others, I had a strong personality and was respected by members of staff and was a mentor and adviser to more junior members of staff.’

Miss Rowe joined Fidelity in 2007 as head of the investments legal team and within four years was earning £135,000 a year and picking up annual bonuses of £49,000.

She said she was perceived as aggressive because she was forthright in her emails, using red and capitals, which she did not realise until later was considered shouting.

She complained of victimisation last year after alleging she had not been given a proper chance to apply for a promotion.

But she was fired after an independent investigation ordered by the human resources department found no evidence of sex discrimination or bullying, the tribunal heard. Miss Rowe, who lives in North London, said: ‘That was at the end of my career. I was 65 and believed I could have worked until 70.

‘It hurt me very deeply I was dismissed when I had gone out of my way to treat people with respect and dignity.’

Katherine Attisha, head of human resources at Fidelity, denied the men were sexist or treated her differently.

She said Miss Rowe’s emails were ‘often very blunt’ and carried a ‘negative undertone’.

‘Her approach would often be directly critical and would frequently focus on the negative,’ she said.

‘She also frequently overstepped the mark from professional interaction to personal attack. Things would never have worked out unless Margaret altered her style and approach, something for which I had seen little or no evidence of her being willing or capable of doing. 

'Margaret seemed ultra-sensitive – always looking for issues and ultimately it was as though she was almost expecting there to be a problem with any change.

‘I was sorry when, ultimately, my efforts to help Margaret to make a success of her role failed, but looking back I’m not sure there was any way we could have ultimately succeeded given the approach she took.’

Miss Rowe was accused by one boss of ‘playing the woman card’ when it suited her, the tribunal heard. Nicola McCabe, head of investment trusts at Fidelity, said she was told by executive director Peter Yandle that ‘when Ms Rowe didn’t like the outcome of a discussion or an outcome of a decision that she could then say this was because she was a woman rather than the fact that it was a business decision.

‘And so he said she will use and first play the woman card .... (and) would state at that point that it was because she was a woman rather than there was a difference of view as to how things could proceed.’

The tribunal continues.
