Move over Tulum - Riviera Nayarit is fast becoming Mexico's hottest destination.

With Kim Kardashian and Kanye West sunning themselves on their second honeymoon in the West Mexican hotspot last week, the area is starting to get noticed.

And not without good reason - as it boasts endless white, sandy beaches, world class
 spas, championship golf courses and a huge yacht marina.

While Kim and Kanye stayed in an exclusive private house, those with less budget (aka everyone) can stay in one of the many eco resorts, boutiques and bed and breakfasts available.

Riviera 
Nayarit stretches along 192 miles of pristine Pacific coast framed by 
the majestic Sierra Madre Mountains just ten minutes north of accessible
 Puerto Vallarta International Airport.

The region extends along the 
entire coast of the Pacific state of Nayarit including the resorts of 
Nuevo Vallarta, the historic colonial town of San Blas, exclusive Punta 
Mita, picturesque fishing villages, miles of serene beaches and 
spectacular Banderas Bay.

Riviera Nayarit offers countless activities, 
such as: PGA golf courses, luxury spas, whale watching, turtle release,

 artwork from the traditional Huichol tribe.

The area attracts holiday makers of all tastes and budgets with its wide range 
of accommodations including chic luxury resorts, eco-tourism boutique 
hotels and smaller bed and breakfasts.

Foodies will love the Suite Coral 
at the Four Seasons Punta Mita, which comes with its own private pool 
and access to the beach, also has an in-house chef to join 
your party and whip up a meal.

Luxury lovers can sip champagne at Altamira Bar overlooking the infinity drop 
fountain at the St Regis Punta Mita or indulge in a pamper session at 
its state-of-the-art, Remede Spa.

Or for more adventure, there's always zip-lining  through the mountains overlooking Sayulita at Rancho Mi Chaparrita.
