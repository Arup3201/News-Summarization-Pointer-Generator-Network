Nearly half the families in the country have just one child, according to an official analysis.

It found the number of one-child families has increased by almost 700,000 in 15 years, and they are likely to be in the majority within a decade.

The Office for National Statistics said larger families are under pressure because of ‘the greater challenge of combining work with childcare with three or more children compared with one or two’.

Almost half of families now only have one child, new analysis from the Office for National Statistics reveals

Many families can no longer afford to 
have more than a single baby, experts said.

Most mothers now have to go 
out to work to pay the bills.

And those who stay at home to bring up 
their children are increasingly penalised by the tax and benefit system.

When the ONS Labour Force Survey 
started asking about the size of families in 1996, there were just over 
three million with a mother, father and one  child – around 42 per cent 
of all families with children. 

Last year there were  3.7million, or 47 
per cent of all families with children.

Some critics fear the decline of the  
traditional family with 2.4 children may lead to a generation of ‘little
 emperors’, a phrase coined in China, where the rule of one child for 
every couple is said to have produced millions of spoilt youngsters.

The survey found there are now three 
million families with two children, roughly the same as in the 
mid-1990s. 

But as a share of all families, two-child households had 
fallen from 41 per cent to 39 per cent.

Since 1996, one-child families have increased in number to 3,663,000, while the number of larger families has fallen

The average number of children in a family is now 1.7, compared to more than two a generation ago, while the ONS found larger families are more like to not have a parent in work

Dr Terri Apter, of Cambridge
University, says:

'There is a concern that singletons will not learn to
share, and will grown up "spoiled". There is however little evidence
for this.

'Though children do learn a great deal from siblings, and generally
benefit from the cooperation and competition they practice on a daily basis
among siblings, singletons also live in a world populated by other people, with
whom they identify and with whom they have to compete, and with whom they learn
to share.

'They have many opportunities to learn from their friends
about closeness and conflict; they have many opportunities to learn that they
cannot have everything their own way; they have many opportunities to learn
that they gain a great deal through sharing.

'Humans are naturally social
beings, and generally want to contribute to their society.

'Incidentally,
singletons tend to be very curious about what having a sibling would be like,
and wonder what kind of a sibling they would make.'

Sophie Zadeh, research assistant at Cambridge University's Centre for Family Research adds:

'Research to date seems to indicate that it is the quality of family relationships, rather than the number of people in a family, that matters most for children's social, psychological and emotional well-being.

'Some of our latest research has been on single women who have used a sperm donor to have a child. Some of these homes are comprised of mother and (only) child and these children seem to be functioning well.'

The biggest decline came among 
families with three or more children.

There were more than 1.3million 
such  families in 1996, but only 1.1million in 2012. They formed 14 per 
cent of all families with children, compared with 17 per cent in 1996.

The number of big families has 
remained relatively high largely because of the impact of Pakistani and 
Bangladeshi migrants, among whom there is less expectation that mothers 
should work and bigger families are more common.

The report said high proportions of 
families with three or more children can be found in London, parts of 
the West Midlands, including Birmingham, and parts of the North, 
including Bradford.

It added: ‘This may be related to the 
ethnicities of people living in these areas, as previous research has 
shown fertility rates in the UK are higher among women born in 
Bangladesh and Pakistan than women born in the UK.’

The authoritative survey, based on a 
sample of 130,000 people across Britain, found parents with large 
families  are more likely to live on state benefits than those with 
smaller ones.

Only 5 per cent of couples with one or
 two children  are workless, the report said, but 13 per cent of those 
with three or more are dependent on benefits.

‘Families with one or two dependent 
children are more likely to have at least one employed parent than those
 with three or more dependent children,’ the report said.

The insurance company Aviva, which 
monitors the cost of raising children, said: ‘Our latest Family Finances
 Report unearthed a similar trend to the ONS data.

‘The practicalities such as feeding 
and clothing are expensive enough, but if a parent wants to return to 
work and childcare fees come into play, this takes the cost of a child 
to a whole new level. One-child families could well become the norm.’

Around 15 per cent of households in the UK have three or more children, putting it seventh in the European league table

Caroline Jones with her daughter Mia

Parents who choose to have only one child face being called lazy and selfish, according to mother-of-one Caroline Jones.

She said she has been challenged repeatedly by friends and families over when she and husband Colin are planning a younger brother or sister for daughter, Mia.

‘The idea of a huge close-knit ¬family, living constantly in each other’s pockets, never held any attraction for me. It sounded far too chaotic and claustrophobic,’ she wrote last year.

‘My rule of thumb has always been that there should never be more children than bathrooms in a home.

‘Before you have children, people hold back a little. After all, you may have undisclosed fertility problems and be secretly desperate for a baby.

‘But once you’ve had one child, it’s open season. People just ask outright as if they’re talking about the local bus service: ‘So, when’s number two going to arrive?’

‘My view is that, unlike parents of large families, we will be able to devote all our time, money and love into turning Mia into a happy, confident little girl. And a raft of recent research backs us up.

‘Obviously one key factor is that we’re all feeling the economic pinch, with parents simply unable to afford the extra cost of another child (a staggering £1,800 before they’re even born, according to one survey last month).

‘Another huge factor in the rise of single-child families is the trend for women to have babies later in life. UK birth records show that a woman having her first child at 35 is much less likely than a 25 year old to have more children. As fertility declines post-35, many women just run out of time.

‘At the end of the day, it’s not about romance, money, the agony of childbirth or all the research that proves how damaging sibling rivalry can be.

‘The honest truth is that Mia is all I want. She’s perfect and I’m done. So no matter how many times I’m asked when I’ll be having my next one, I won’t be changing my mind.’
