Australian Taxation Office (ATO) agents have been found to have engaged in 'conscious maladministration' that resulted in a $30 million tax bill that's now been quashed by the Federal Court.

Documents were used subject to legal professional privilege in issuing the multimillion-dollar bill to an Australian businessman Garry John Donoghue. 

'Garry, if you don't pay me and my family, I will have no hesitation in giving the ATO everything I have on you. You should be very worried,' his legal adviser Simeon Moore told Mr Donoghue before leaking his information to the Australian Taxation Office, the court heard.

The Tax Office told Fairfax Media it would be appealing the decision.

The Age reports that Mr Donoghue, 58, a former Queenslander who is now living in London, ran a string of telecommunications businesses, including as the former managing director of listed mobile-services provider Plus SMS. 

He took the case to the Federal Court, arguing that Mr Moore, who was angry over alleged unpaid fees, passed on his file to the Tax Office.

Federal Court Justice Logan found that the ATO assessment  was invalid because it was based on information under legal professional privilege, and the ATO had no right to use it.

The ATO assessment was issued for tax years 2005 to 2007 and amounting to over $30 million when taking account interest and penalties.

Mr Moore, who at the time was not admitted as a legal practitioner but was a friend of Mr Donoghue's daughter, Alexandria, had issued Mr Donoghue with a bill for legal services amounting to $753,174.

Mr Moore and Mr Donoghue's daughter, Alexandria were studying at Bond University in the Gold Coast together at the time.

Justice Logan said this was 'outrageously extortionate' and a 'fantasy' amount given Mr Moore was an 'as-yet-not-admitted graduate undertaking post-graduate studies in law'.

The Tax Office said that it would be appealing the decision

He said the decision by the ATO officer to later proceed and use the information could be attributed to 'inexperience and zeal, coupled with a lack of relevant supervision and guidance'. 

It had shown 'reckless disregard' of a right for Mr Donoghue to claim legal professional privilege. 

Justice Logan quashed the $30 million tax bill and also ordered that the Commissioner of Taxation pay Mr Donoghue's legal costs.
