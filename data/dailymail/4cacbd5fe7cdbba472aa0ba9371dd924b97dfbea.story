Steve Claridge believes Lee Clark cannot blame Birmingham's uncertain future for his poor results after he left the club.

The former Huddersfield boss parted company with Blues on Monday after just two wins this season which has left them 21st in the Sky Bet Championship.

Blues have also won just once in a year in the league at St Andrew's and lost 1-0 at home to Bolton on Saturday.

On Monday morning Clark said he would not quit but by the afternoon he had left.

He had to work with a vastly reduced budget with the club up for sale, but Claridge insisted the ex-Newcastle midfielder still should have done better.

"I don't think it should be used as an excuse. It has been difficult but he probably had to do a little better," said Claridge, who scored 42 goals in 120 games for Blues between 1994 and 1996.

"Yes, there are extraneous circumstances but he'll be disappointed.

"If you've not got the players then you say 'OK, fine' but the players have shown they are capable of winning games.

"They are not poor players because they've won games. You can ask why they are not winning more games and then you have to look at the manager.

"Only the players and the manager know how much responsibility they have to take."

Clark had been Birmingham boss since June 2012 but had won just one of his last 24 home league games.

Blues could drop into the relegation zone if they fail to win at Blackburn on Tuesday and Fulham beat Rotherham.

They avoided the drop on the final day of last season after drawing 2-2 with Bolton, fighting back from 2-0 down, and Claridge believes they should be able to survive again.

The BBC Football League pundit said: "What are the expectations there? Not to get relegated at this stage. If they get up to mid-table in the Championship, which should be achievable, they should be okay.

"They were taking it down to the wire last year when they were 2-0 down at Bolton and looked like they were gone.

"It's a difficult job but any job is difficult, it's as difficult as you make it."
