The tech entrepreneur dubbed ‘The Third Winklevoss’ could be in line for a multimillion dollar payout after a breakthrough in his lawsuit against the founder of Snapchat.

Frank Reginald Brown ‘may deserve something’ for his role in setting up up the photo-sharing app, chief executive Evan Spiegel has admitted.

During a deposition in the case Spiegel added that Brown made ‘contributions’ that helped make the firm so successful it recently rejected a $3 billion buyout deal from Facebook.

Brown has sued Spiegel and former friend Bobby Murphy because he claims they stole the idea for Snapchat from him when they were all students at Stanford.

He alleges that things suddenly turned sour so they changed the passwords to the servers and shut him out.

Brown wants one-third of Snapchat even though he previously agreed to 20 per cent, the lawsuit states. Currently he owns nothing.

Observers have said that the case has echoes of the case brought by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, which ended with a $65 million settlement.

In a video deposition obtained by Business Insider, Spiegel admitted that Brown came up with the idea for photos that disappeared after a few seconds, the main feature of Snapchat.

The most compelling exchange was when Spiegel was asked: ‘Do you think Reggie deserves anything for the contributions he made on the project?’

Snapchat is a photo messaging app for iOS and Android devices, developed by Stanford University students.

Using the app, users can take photos, record videos, add text and drawings and send them to a controlled list of recipients.

These sent photographs and videos are known as 'Snaps'.

Users set a time limit for how long recipients can view their Snaps (from one to 10 seconds) after which they will be hidden from the recipient's device and deleted from the Snapchat server.

The social app is currently delivering more than 350 million photos every day.

Snapchat hasn't made any money yet as it doesn't sell adverts or charge people to download or use its app, but it has attracted a lot of investment.

It has just added Snapchat stories, which lets users link photos and videos together, where they exist for 24 hours.

The app has come under fire from people worried about sexting and cyber bullying.

After a pause lasting seven seconds, he replied: ‘Reggie may deserve something for some of his contributions.’

Murphy also gave a deposition during which time he was asked about a Facebook status update he wrote in which he calls Brown his ‘employer’.

Looking uncomfortable as he replied, Murphy said: ‘Uh ...Well it looks like here that I did something to that effect.

‘I don't have a specific recollection of this happening ... although I would say that it would have been unclear to me what ... tagging someone as an 'employer' under Facebook would mean.’

Snapchat is one of the most popular photo sharing apps in the world, especially among young people.

According to research by Pew Internet, 26 per cent of under 30s use it, though the number of over 30s was tiny.

In November it reported that users sent 400 million messages every day, which is more than Facebook and Instagram combined.

Critics claim that Snapchat encourages ‘sexting’ among teenagers who don’t have to fear being embarrassed by images lingering around.

Spiegel's legal team said in a statement: ‘We are aware of the allegations, believe them to be utterly devoid of merit, and will vigorously defend ourselves against this frivolous suit’.
