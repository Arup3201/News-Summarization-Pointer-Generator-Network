An elk has been found frozen solid after falling through the icy surface of a Norwegian lake.

The animal was found frozen in the middle of the water near Bodo in northern Norway with just its antler visible above the ice.

It appears the ice cracked beneath it as it was trying to cross and the animal fell in, but was unable to pull itself out and froze to death.

Frozen: The animal was found frozen solid in the middle of the water near Bodo in northern Norway with just its antlers and back visible above the ice

Inger Sjøberg, 47, found the animal as she was skating across the lake, reported The Local.

'I was out skating with my boyfriend, and we saw something dark on the ice,' she told the Norway edition of the English language website.

'I thought it was some wood or some grass or something, and when we looked at it, we saw that it was an elk. I have never seen it before, a frozen animal in the ice.'

She said she believed the elk must have fallen through earlier in the winter before the ice hardened properly.

Although many can swim and bear cold weather better than humans, they can still die of exhaustion if they tread water too long

'We had to go out a bit from land, so the ice was strong enough when he started to walk, but then further out it was not strong enough. It's part of nature that animals die in this way.'

Since her grim, but unusual discovery the body has been become a local attraction and visitors have made the trip to view the frozen carcass. 

It is not uncommon for animals to fall into icy water, become trapped and die.

Although many can swim and bear cold weather better than humans, they can still die of exhaustion if they tread water too long.

Last month two horses in Missouri were rescued by firefighters from a frozen lake after they'd fallen through the ice.

The dramatic rescue happened in the town of Warrenton - about 40 miles east of St. Louis - when the two horses fell through the ice on a private lake as their owner, Tina Churchill, watched helplessly.

Rescuers used chainsaws to cut a path through the ice where the horses could make it out, and after about an hour, they made it to dry land - and a thankful owner.
