It may still be dreary outside but Lorraine Kelly is getting into the springtime spirit in her latest fashion campaign.

The 54-year-old is the star of mature fashion retailer JD Williams' latest campaign. 

The Scottish TV star showcases the new collection of floral dresses, bright separates and statement jumpsuits, including pieces from Lorraine’s own range for the retailer.

The advert - a multi-million pound campaign by JD Williams - was filmed on location in Cape Town, South Africa and features Lorraine at a lively summer garden party dancing with friends to the Gipsy King’s salsa track, Bamboleo.

The brand hopes to convey its mission to put the fun back into shopping and fashion, based around their guarantee of clothes that 'fit to flatter' the mature figure.

Lorraine’s dance moves were inspired by her Zumba fitness classes, which she enjoys three times a week, along with walking regularly to keep fit and healthy.

Speaking about her latest campaign, Lorraine said: 'The shoot for the spring TV advert was so much fun and we all had such a giggle! 

'Not only were we able to enjoy the beautiful surroundings of Cape Town, we loved the upbeat music and dance routine, and we were dressed in gorgeous outfits to boot.

'The women looked so summery and stylish. I hope the collection will be big hit for women looking for great fashionable styles and fit.'

In January, Lorraine channeled her styling expertise into designing her own range.

Lorraine’s first collection for JD Williams was targeted at the 50-plus female and came on the back of research by the brand that revealed just 20 per cent of mature women feel well catered for on the high street.

'It was really about what I want to wear as well as a lot of feedback from viewers over the years. I wanted classy but comfortable clothes that look stylish and are also flattering,' she said.

Lorraine, who served as the face of JD Williams before designing the range for the brand, believes that there's a big untapped market of 50-plus women who are 'in their prime and want to look fashionable'.

She said: 'Women of 50-plus look better than ever and as a 55-year-old, I know that I want to look chic and on trend but also have the comfort factor.'

Lorraine spent hours in the design studio curating chic Burberry-esque raincoats and Issa-esque wrap dresses, as well as a jumpsuit that you could 'wear around the house' or team with 'sassy high heels on a night out'.
