A canine commuter stunned passengers by attempting to travel solo on the London Underground after boarding a tube during rush hour.

Station staff saw the Staffordshire Bull Terrier trot calmly through the ticket barriers, bound down to the platform using an escalator and jump aboard a Piccadilly line tube at Cockfosters station.

The intrepid traveller - who station staff joked could have been trying to travel to Barking, 'Jack' Russell Square or 'German' Shepherd's Bush - even climbed on to a seat.

Ready for the off: Joy the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, doesn't seem to understand the hold up as she took her seat on the 6.55am London-bound Piccadilly Line tube from Cockfoster station

Thankfully staff spotted her before the train left the station and she was carried across London.

The RSPCA is now trying to trace the owner of the brindle and white-coloured dog, who started her tube journey at Cockfosters station in North London at 6.55am on December 20.

RSPCA inspector Phil Norman, who has named the dog Joy, said: 'She scampered through the station so confidently we think she must be a frequent commuter.

Bundle of Joy: The Staffordshire Bull Terrier seemed happy to be out and about when RSPCA officers pictured her - so much so they have named her Joy

Last stop: The RSPCA is now trying to trace the owner of the brindle and white-coloured dog, who started - and ended - her tube journey at Cockfosters station

'People said she looked just as if she was waiting for the train to go.

'She is a bit scruffy and has a skin condition and a cut under her eye.

'Joy is obviously a seasoned traveller because she found her way down to the trains and perhaps she was just hoping to go into London for some Christmas shopping?'
