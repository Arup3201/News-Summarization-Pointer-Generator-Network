Overweight claimants should have their benefits cut if they do not exercise enough, councils declared yesterday.

Rent subsidies paid through housing and council tax benefits may be ‘varied’ depending on whether they obey instructions to go swimming or to gyms and yoga classes, a think-tank said.

Proposals for town halls to promote healthy lifestyles added that shops should be given cash from council taxpayers to stock more fruit and vegetables.

The ideas were put forward as councils prepare to take over more than £2billion which previously went to the NHS for public health campaigns.

Cutting benefits for the obese was suggested by Westminster council and the Local Government Information Unit, a council-funded think-tank.

Philippa Roe, leader of the flagship Tory authority, said: ‘This report contains exactly the sort of bright, forward-thinking and radical ideas that need to be looked at.’

The document suggested that financial pressure on the jobless and unhealthy could begin this spring when control of state public health programmes shifts to town halls.

The changes will see GPs given powers to prescribe activity at public leisure centres to patients they consider take too little exercise. The rise of smart cards means their activities can be monitored more easily.

The Westminster report said town halls should ‘link welfare measures to behaviours that promote public health’.

It added: ‘Several authorities have schemes that allow GPs to prescribe physical activities at local facilities, including council swimming pools, gyms, yoga and walking clubs.

‘The increasing use of smart cards for access to leisure facilities, for instance, provides a significant amount of data.

‘Where an exercise package is prescribed, housing and council tax benefit could be varied to reward or incentivise residents.’

Subsidies to shops could be given in ‘food deserts’ where campaigners contend it is hard to buy healthy food, the report added.

But Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said public money should not be used to ‘meddle’ with what shops sell.

The £2billion kitty paid for NHS ‘five-a-day’ co-ordinators and publicity campaigns devised by the last Labour government.

In other Coalition reforms, councils also have new powers to cut the benefits they pay if claimants behave in an anti-social way.
