It was the sight that no Spain fan expected to witness so soon.

Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Sergio Ramos and Co left for Brazil just two weeks ago but the Spanish squad arrived back at Adolfo Suarez Airport in Madrid on Tuesday empty handed.

They had travelled with the World Cup in their cargo as defending champions and they returned with nothing following their surprising group stage exit.

Manchester United 
goalkeeper David de Gea and Barcelona midfielder Xavi were among the 
players seen hugging each other goodbye as the squad went their separate
 ways.

Real Madrid captain
 Ramos waved at the camera as he walked with his suitcase and Barcelona 
star Pedro hugged United's record signing Juan Mata.

Xavi's Barcelona 
team-mate Iniesta, who left the airport in a taxi with his fellow 
midfielder, tweeted upon his return: 'Hello everyone. There’s not much 
you can say at times like
these. The disappointment of coming home so early has been huge.

'We had such
hopes of doing well at the World Cup and that didn’t happened. I ask for your
forgiveness and I assure you all that we will work to put the team back where
it belongs. My love to all…'

Coach Vicente del Bosque, whose job is under serious question, is also seen kissing his wife on his return to Spain.

Spain were humbled 
5-1 by Holland in their opening World Cup Group B match before 
succumbing to a 2-0 defeat to Chile - a result that confirmed their 
elimination.

They did salvage some pride with a 3-0 victory over Australia on Monday, but the damage had already been done.

Goals from David 
Villa, who left the field in tears on his likely final Spain appearance,
 Chelsea's Fernando Torres and Mata sealed the win.
