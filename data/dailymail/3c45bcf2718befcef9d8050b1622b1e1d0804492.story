Amateur-sleuth: Lois Duncan arrives at the Los Angeles premiere of 'Hotel For Dogs' at the Grove Pacific Theatres on January 15, 2009 in Los Angeles, California - Duncan has spent the past 25-years investigating her daughter's death

While you may not have heard of author Lois Duncan or the tragic and unsolved murder of her 18-year-old daughter in 1989, you definitely know the 1997 cult movie, I Know What You Did Last Summer.

Written by Duncan, 80, in 1973, the hit, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar, spawned sequels and spoofs as the 90s most memorable horror film, along with Scream.

Despite the success of her fiction, in reality, Duncan has been battling for the past 25-years to discover the truth behind her girl, Kaitlyn's death in Albuquerque, New Mexico - a journey which has taken her to the doors of organized crime and a possible police cover-up.

Indeed, as
 life began to imitate art, Duncan's dogged pursuit of the truth of her 
daughter's murder began on the night of July 16th, 1989.

Her
 teenage daughter had just graduated high school and left a girlfriend's
 house in her 1984 Ford Tempo at 10.45pm. after watching Valley Girl.

Kaitlyn,
 who had just been accepted into the University of New Mexico to study 
medicine braked as she approached a railway crossing in Albuquerque at 
around 10.45pm.

Suddenly
 she was shot twice, once through the temple and once through the cheek 
by a shooter who opened fire on the driver's side of the vehicle.

She was rushed to hospital, placed on life support and put into a medically induced coma.

Sadly, she died the next day and for the past quarter century, Duncan has used all her amateur sleuth skills to decipher any possible suspects and motives related to the act.

The official police investigation determined that the lethal assault was a random act of violence, perpetrated by drive-by shooters.

Duncan however, found evidence that suggested otherwise.

Murdered: Kaitlyn Arquette was shot dead at a railway crossing while she was sitting on the drivers side. Two bullets hit her in the head

Capable student Kaitlyn was seeing Dung Nguyen, a Vietnamese immigrant at the time of her murder.

Ten years her older, Nguyen was one of his nation's boat people - who fled the war torn nation after the United States pulled out in 1975.

He was dismissed as a suspect in the killing because his fingers tested negative for any gun residue.

Furthermore, the police found a letter from Kaitlyn in the apartment she lived in with Nguyen that said, 'Hon, where are you? I know you're still mad. I'm so sorry OK! I miss you today. I went to the mom's house to return these books. I'll see ya. Love.'

Because of this note the police ruled out fighting between the couple as a motive for her murder.

But, five days later, Nguyen was discovered to have stabbed himself in the stomach in the middle of the night, in what he claimed was a suicide attempt.

This raised the suspicions of Duncan, who wondered why anyone would try and kill themselves so painfully by stabbing themselves in the midriff?

Digging deeper, Duncan found that Nguyen was part of a multi-million dollar insurance fraud in Southern California.

The scam was to stage a car accidents with both parties involved to claim fraudulent insurance money.

This was a burgeoning business among Vietnamese immigrants in Southern California and Nguyen would sometimes take Kaitlyn along with him when he carried out the fraud.

Promising student: Kaitlyn Arquette was preparing to study medicine at the University of New Mexico before her murder in 1989

This set her mind racing and she rushed to visit Nguyen in hospital, where he was recovering from his self-inflicted stabbing.

Duncan told Buzzfeed's Tim Stelloh that while heavily sedated, Nguyen told her that he didn't kill Kaitlyn, but he was 'deciding' whether he loved he enough to tell police who did.

Hiring private investigators and even psychic detectives to aid in her search, Duncan then discovered that Albuquerque police knew that Nguyen was involved in fraud and had decided not to investigate his association with Vietnamese gangs.

Things became even more skewed when Duncan was finally shown the note that Kaitlyn had written for Nguyen.

She was adamant that this was not her daughter's handwriting and then, staggeringly, the case became even murkier.

A close friend of Kaitlyn's told Duncam that Nguyen phoned her on the night of the shooting screaming 'Kait's dead!'.

However, police did not travel to notify Nguyen of his girlfriend's death until 3am - several hours after that panicked phone call.

Then, the case twisted even further when two men, Miguel Garcia and Juvenal 'Juve' Escobedo, 18 and 21-years-old, were arrested and charged with the killing.

Police told Duncan that the two men had randomly killed her daughter after one of the men bet the other to shoot Kaitlyn - and he did.

I Know What You Did Last Summer: The hit 1997 movie starred Freddie Prinze Jr, (left)  Jennifer Love Hewitt (center left),  Sarah Michelle Gellar (center right),  Ryan Phillippe (right) and was based on Lois Duncan's 1973 bestseller

However, despite the insistence of district attorney Robert Schwartz that the two men were guilty, there was no evidence and no motive aside from random violence.

A jury agreed and dismissed the charges against Garcia and Escobedo.

Duncan now feels that the police were inept and willfully incompetent in the case and missed a key detail discovered by private investigator, Pat Caristro years later.

On the night of Kaitlyn's murder, the first detective to respond to the scene found a man called Paul Apodaca standing by the car, who claimed to be just walking by.

According to Caristo, 'standard procedure would have required police to run Apodaca's name,' which they did not.

If they had they would have discovered that Apodaca had been charged with 'committing multiple violent attacks against women, including robbery and beating a young girl with a baseball bat.'

His car matched the make and model, although not the color, of what eye-witnesses said was a car which dashed away from the scene.

Duncan became obsessed by the crime and returned frequently to psychics and private investigators to solve the murder of her daughter.

She wrote two books, Who Killed my Daughter? and One to the Wolves, about the killing.

Tragically there is no answer for Duncan.

Stelloh asks, 'Was there a relationship between Apodaca, the 'Vietnamese connection' and Escobedo and Garcia? Had the crime scene been derailed by incompetence or by a cover-up? Had Kait stumbled onto something even more sinister than insurance fraud?'

Duncan herself believes that her daughter was targeted and police tried to cover their tracks after they discovered that Apodaca had not been stopped at the time.

For their part, the Albuquerque Police believe that Duncan is becoming a hindrance to the still unsolved murder.

'When she puts out stuff that’s not factual, it’s not helping the case,' Major Anthony Montano said to Stelloh at Buzzfeed.

'Montano would not say which details were not factual, nor how they had 'compromised” APD’s investigation, as he put it.'
