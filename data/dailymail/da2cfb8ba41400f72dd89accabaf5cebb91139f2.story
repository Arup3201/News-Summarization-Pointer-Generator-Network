A teenager will become Britain's youngest landlord this weekend when he is given his own pub for his 18th birthday.

Charlie Watts, 17, will take control of The Cherry Tree in Yaxley, Suffolk, which his parents have run for the last 11 years.

The teenager asked his mother and father for a job at their pub when he left school - but they have gone further and made him the manager.

Youngest landlord: Charlie Watts, 17, who will this weekend take over his own pub when he turns 18. His parents have given him The Cherry Tree in Yaxley, Suffolk, which they own

Family business: Charlie with his mother Nikki who has run The Cherry Tree for the last 11 years. She will be on hand to offer him support as he takes control of the business

Charlie will officially receive his landlord's licence on Saturday when he turns 18 - and his name will go over the door of the independent hostelry, which his parents own.

His father Andy, 42, has recently got a new job as a business development manager so does not have time to work behind the bar as well.

Charlie said: 'It's going to be hard work, I can guarantee that.

'My dad and mum did it for 11 years and they didn't get to where they are without putting in the hours.

'I've helped out since we came here when I was seven years old.

'I've been chatting and getting to know the people and without actually knowing it I've taken it all in, getting experience which will obviously help.'

Landlord: Charlie, 17, has been helping out his parents in the pub since he was seven - and will take control from this Saturday

His mother Nikki, 41, will help Charlie settle into his new role and she said: 'My husband just had the idea to train Charlie up to be a landlord when he left to start his new job.

'It will be lovely to know that our son is the one who we have handed the pub on to. I'm already seeing a different side to him.

'My children have grown up here and become confident and independent children as a result.

'The toughest part for him will be the late nights and early morning but I'm sure he'll manage okay.

'Charlie is determined that all the ales we have here will be as good as his dad's. He won't let standards slip.'

Proud mother: Nikki will give control of her pub to her son this weekend when he turns 18

In 2006 Chris Hardacre, 12, became the youngest person to work in a bar thanks to a loophole in government legislation.

He worked at his father's pub, the Star Inn, in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, and regularly served alcohol to customers.

In 2009, Chantelle Britton and Luke Cunnett became the youngest couple to run a pub when they became landlords just months after their 18th birthdays.

The pair took control of the Bluebell Inn in Sutton, Nottinghamshire.

And Lewis Marriott became one of the youngest landlords in the country when he received his licence just three weeks after turning 18.

But the teenager, from Gillingham, Kent, was unable to properly become a landlord because he didn't have a pub to take control of.

Birthday cheers: Charlie Watts will begin pouring pints at the bar this weekend when he becomes a landlord. He is currently not old enough to buy them
