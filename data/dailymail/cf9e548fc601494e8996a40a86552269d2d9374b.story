A group of Tesco night workers were today celebrating a £3.7million lottery win after one of them asked their daughter to buy the ticket - because seagull droppings had landed on her.

The 15 colleagues who all work at the same branch of the supermarket in Roborough, Devon, each scooped £245,996 in the massive win - with the numbers 5, 9, 14, 25, 34 and 38.

Syndicate leader Jackie Beresford, 56, who has worked at Tesco, who pay colleagues around £7 per hour, since 2007, first suspected her luck might be in when she visited a psychic who said her financial situation would soon improve.

But the mother-of-five later decided not to buy the weekly ticket as usual - and leave the purchase to her daughter, who had been struck by seagull droppings.

Mrs Beresford said: ‘My daughter and her husband and their daughter were at a Christening when a seagull left its mark, so to speak. 

‘In my book that’s a sign of good luck to come and I suggested she bought the syndicate tickets - and it came true.’

The workers, who formed a syndicate in 2010, won £3,689,940. They have had a number of smaller wins previously, meaning they were able to share out a few hundred pounds each Christmas.

They now plan to spend their winnings on paying off mortgages and family holidays - while one member of the syndicate, Mandy Bunker, 48, said she would spend it on new teeth.

Nine of the 15 winners who have agreed to go public were celebrating their new-found fortune today.

Mrs Beresford, who was widowed earlier this year when her husband of 26 years David died of cancer, had also visited a psychic two weeks before the win.

She said: ‘She told me my husband had one
 regret, that he had not left me in a better financial situation - but 
that he had a plan. I just know he’s shining down on me and looking 
after me, and this was his way of doing it.

'One thing is for certain, by the end of this week my house will be my own. We’ve decided we will all cut back on shifts but none of us will stop working'

Jackie Beresford, syndicate leader

'I know most of us just haven’t had the time to think about what we’re planning to spend some of the money on. But I know what I will be doing first and that’s paying off my mortgage so I’ll have no more worries on that front. One thing is for certain, by the end of this week my house will be my own.

‘We’ve decided we will all cut back on shifts but none of us will stop working.’

All
 15 of the syndicate live in the Plymouth area and work together on the 
10pm-7am shift at the Tesco Roborough store, where they ensure the 
shelves are re-stocked overnight.

Mrs Beresford was working the night shift on Saturday when she got a call saying the syndicate had won.

She said: ‘We’re a pretty close-knit group and get on really well together and some of us were at work on the night shift when we found out about our win after last Saturday’s draw.

‘I had a call from one of the members to say we’d won the jackpot and I just screamed. I don’t know how we finished that night shift, but we did - with the help of a glass of champagne.

'It’s life changing to us - it just makes life a lot easier'

Alison Lonsdale, winner

‘I’m just glad the winning ticket is now out of my house. I hid it in a DVD cassette box, but I was terrified I might lose it.

‘Clare’s numbers were completely random - she wanted numbers that nobody had.’

Grandmother-of-eight Mrs Beresford also plans to treat her children to a holiday.

Other syndicate members going public included Sarah Wheatley, 46, Kay Richards, 56, Tina Carpenter, 46, Vanessa Rice, 47, Alison Lonsdale, 45, and Sheila Bird, 50.

At a press conference at The Duke of Cornwall Hotel in Plymouth, Ms Lonsdale, who works as a primary school dinner lady as well as part time at the store, said: ‘It’s life changing to us - it just makes life a lot easier.’
