Karen Danczuk has come under fire numerous times over the last year for her sexy selfies, which often display her ample cleavage. 

And the Rochdale councillor clearly isn't changing her ways for 2015, sharing two pictures direct from her beach holiday in Spain.

Cllr Danczuk, who is married to Simon Danczuk, a Labour MP, has posted the pictures on Twitter, much to the delight of her 34,000 followers. 

Different year, same tricks! Cllr Karen Danczuk, who is married to MP Simon Danczuk,  posted some cleavge-baring pictures on Twitter, much to the delight of her 34,000 followers

The snaps, which show off the 31-year-old brunette’s generous cleavage, were taken on the beach in Spain, where she has been escaping the cold British winter. 

Alongside one of the pictures, Cllr Danczuk wrote: 'OK so I couldn’t come to my favourite beach without taking a selfie!!'

In another tweet, the Rochdale politician said: 'When negativity is upon us***it’s always best to smile.'

Cllr Danczuk also commented on the silhouette of her phone was showing up on her chest, writing: 'The sun is shining so there’s still a little shadow!'

One holiday selfie showed her post-workout, while another was taken in the front seat of a car, with the politician adding: 'It’s that time of the day where I partake in a little Spanish driving!'.

The councillor has revealed that she has been slimming down following jibes about her weight from online trolls.

The 31-year-old was seen exercising with a personal trainer at park in Rochdale, Greater Manchester - just weeks after she admitted that the abuse had motivated her to lose half a stone.

The mother-of-two, who is married to 47-year-old Rochdale MP Mr Danczuk, completed a challenging total-body circuit yesterday - which included push-ups, boxing and lunges. 

She was kept on track by her trainer, Ben Bate, from Bodypro personal training studios in Rochdale.  

Cllr Danczcuk has grabbed headlines around the world with her eye-catching selfies, regularly posted on Twitter.

She also sold scented photographs of herself to her many fans on eBay in the run up to Christmas. 

Karen has become well-known and popular on social media for her revealing selfies

Her actions haven't come without criticism. In October last year, she went on national television to defend her posting of revealing selfies.

Cllr Danczuk came head-to-head with notoriously outspoken journalist Janet Street-Porter on ITV's Loose Women.

The politician became embroiled in a discussion with Street-Porter about her self-taken snaps.

She was also embroiled in a furious online Twitter spat with the former Tory MP Louise Mensch over pictures of her cleavage.

The Labour councillor told her thousands of Twitter followers that she has been sunbathing topless on holiday after Mrs Mensch publicly accused her of demeaning women in politics by posting pictures of her cleavage online.

But Karen, wife of Labour MP Simon Danczuk, hit back - accusing Mrs Mensch of being 'obsessed' with her chest and called on her to stop 'bitching' about other women in politics.
