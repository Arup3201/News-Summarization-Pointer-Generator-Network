South Africa’s hopes of qualifying for the quarter finals at the Africa Cup of Nations hang by a thread after they drew with Senegal in Mongomo.

Oupa Manyisa rounded off a fine move with a clinical finish early in the second half to give Shakes Mashaba’s side the lead, but Serigne Mbodji, bizarrely wearing gloves despite the stifling jungle heat, leveled things up 15 minutes later with a towering header.

The result puts Senegal top of the competitions’s ‘Group of Death’, a point ahead of both Ghana and Algeria, but Bafana Bafana must win their final game against the Black Stars to have any chance of progression.

After a first half of few chances, the game came to life in the second, with Manyisa’s goal igniting a crowd that had already watched 135 minutes of football with barely a shot on target following the bore-fest earlier between the group's other two sides.

A neat move saw Bournemouth striker Tokelo Rantie create space and feed Thuso Phala down the right. His low cross found Oupa Manyisa at the back post and the Orlando Pirates winger made no mistake, slotting coolly past Coundoul.

As it had in their previous game against Ghana, going a goal behind brough Senegal out of their shells.

They had shaded the possession from the off, but aside from an early run from Southampton’s Sadio Mane, returning from injury after missing the win over Ghana with a troublesome hamstring, the Senegalese carried little threat from open play, despite their array of forwards.

However, when the majority of your team are over six foot and built like a fleet of tanks, set pieces will always be a threat.

And so it proved. Having gone close several times - Stoke City’s Mame Biram Diouf the most culpable – and having had a Mane goal disallowed correctly for offside, finally the Senegalese superiority in the air told.

Mbodji got up highest at the back post and powered a header over Thapelo Mabokgwane to equalize.

The keeper was not directly at fault, but it was his uncertainty under the high ball that contributed to South Africa’s nervousness at set pieces.

Mabokgawane always looked shaky, twice misjudging a cross and almost dropping it into his own net, and fumbling Diouf’s header in the lead-up to Mane’s disallowed goal.

You have to sympathise with the Bafana Bafana boss Mashaba – after first choice keeper’s Senzo Meyiwa tragic death just weeks ago, he decided Darren Keet would get the number one jersey.

But Keet was at fault for at least one, perhaps two of the three goals South Africa conceded against Algeria, and Mashaba has had to call upon Mabokgwane, who just a few months ago was considered fourth choice for the national side.

The 27-year-old did make one excellent save, however, pushing away Dame Ndoye’s shot at full stretch as Senegal pushed for a winner.

The result was harsh on South Africa, who played some lovely football before falling to defeat in their first game on Monday, and again showed plenty of one-touch interplay around the box, threatening to create chances.

However, actually breaching a well-organised Senegalese backline proved difficult, and Bouna Coundoul was rarely overly stretched in goal.

Sibusiso Vilikazi forced Coundoul into a sharp save with a rising drive after a lovely passage of play, and Thabo Matlaba fired just wide from a similar move on the other side, but chances were relatively few and far between.

The niggly nature of the game suited Senegal, who carried far more physical presence, particularly in midfield. Doncaster Rovers midfielder, and South Africa captain, Dean Furman was incensed by one tackle in particular, when Lamine Gassama lunged in on Andile Jali, but escaped a booking.

And, in the end, it was the extra height and presence that the Senegal side possessed, rather than any particular skill, that could have earned them all three points, Mbodji coming close to his second goal, again with a header from a set piece, in the closing stages.
