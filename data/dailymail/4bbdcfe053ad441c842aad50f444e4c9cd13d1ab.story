New memoirs by an African woman that document her bizarre childhood living in exile in the secretive state of North Korea could shed new light on the totalitarian regime.

Monique Macias spent 15 years living in the capital Pyongyang, where her school days consisted of firing Kalashnikov rifles at the same prestigious military academy that heir apparent Kim Jong-il was educated.

Now in her 40s, Ms Macias said: 'All my childhood memories start from when I arrived on that plane in Pyongyang.

'I know how Koreans think and how to talk to them because they taught me. They made me.'

Her memoirs 'I'm Monique, From Pyongyang' are written in Korean.

The youngest child of Francisco Macias Nguema, whose reign in Equatorial Guinea ended 
with his trial and execution in the late 1970s, the book charts her arrival and upbringing in the communist state.

Shortly
 before his death, and with few friends left, Macias Nguema turned to 
North Korea for help and sent his wife and children to Pyongyang, where 
they would spend the next 15 years.

The relationship between the two fringe states was not unusual in the Cold War tension of the time.

North
 Korea strived to build ties with smaller nations stuck on the periphery
 of the splits that pitted the United States and its allies against the 
Soviet Union, China and other communist countries.

Being one of very few black people in
 Pyongyang and living in a strange country taught Ms Macias to see the 
world differently.

This, she said, is what inspired her to publish her 
memoirs now, with tensions between North and South Korea running high.

She said: 'Although
 North and South say they want unification, they don't actually know 
each other as people. If we want unification, we have to bury 
prejudice.'

Ms Macias, who 
left North Korea in 1994 and spends time with family in Spain, still 
speaks Korean as her first language after those formative years in 
Pyongyang with children of the elite.

On
 social occasions the country's founding leader, Kim Il-sung,
 would nag her to study hard, which made him seem like a 'typical Korean
 grandfather'.

At the 
Mangyongdae Revolutionary School, the uniform worn by Ms Macias and her 
sister and brother was a military-style jacket with officer's pips on 
the epaulettes and a green cap emblazoned with a shiny red star.

Her education, which she speaks highly of, was peppered with survival courses and drills.

She said: 'The
 first week, all of us were so hungry after shooting, climbing and 
running every day that we ate our weekly rations in three days and, for 
the other four days, we were hungry.

'But we learned - we learned we had to organise ourselves.'

The
 school traditionally took only boys but Ms Macias said a class was created
 for girls so she and her sister could study together.

Each girl was given a Kalashnikov to train with and had to learn how to strip, clean and reassemble it.

She said: 'Most
 people could shoot guns when they were 18 or 19. But because I was put 
in the only class with girls my sister's age, I was able to shoot when I
 was 14.

'I could probably still shoot it but I don't remember how to strip it.'

She recalls rumours in 1989 of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement and 
subsequent massacre in Beijing reaching the hallways of North Korean 
colleges.

'I felt 
university students in Pyongyang at the time were thinking about change 
too. Although they (North Korean media) didn't report it, a lot of 
people knew about it.'

Under
 the North Korean education system, anti-Americanism became a constant 
factor in her understanding of the world as a child, something that made
 meeting her first American a big shock on a rare trip to see relatives 
in Beijing.

She said: 'At that time 
no one there spoke English and I was lost. I saw a white guy passing and
 I asked him if he spoke English but when he started talking he had an 
American accent,' Macias said.

'I
 was so scared. I thought "oh my god, it's an American". My palms were 
sweating and I just started to run. He was shouting "hey, stop! I'm not 
going to eat you".'

This week, state media in North Korea criticised a report by a US think-tank on scenarios for the collapse of a reclusive country with a grim record of famine, prison camps and nuclear brinkmanship.

But Ms Macias sees that as unlikely.

She said: 'There are people in North Korea who know that this is not the right way to live," she told Reuters in Seoul.

'I don't think it's going to collapse easily. What I'll say is that it can open up like China but very, very slowly.'
