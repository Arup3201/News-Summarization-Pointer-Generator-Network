While some players were using the international break to let loose, Manchester United winger Angel di Maria was spending some quality time with his daughter.

Despite a busy fixture list with Argentina, the 26-year-old still had the energy to play with his daughter Mia. 

United's record signing played the full 90 minutes as Argentina lost 2-0 to Brazil at the Beijing National Stadium in China.

He also featured as a second-half substitute as Gerardo Martino's side demolished Hong Kong 7-0. 

Lionel Messi, Gonzalo Higuain and Nicolas Gaitan all scored twice while Ever Banega grabbed the other goal.

Next up for Di Maria and his United team-mates is a clash with West Brom at The Hawthorns.
