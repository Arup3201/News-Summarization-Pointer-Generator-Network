Victoria Police confirm Si-Tian Wang, 15, has been found safe and well, after she made contact with her parents on Monday night 

Victorian teenager Si-Tian Wang has been located safe and well.

Her family and police feared for the safety of the 15-year-old after she left her Vermont home on Saturday night.

Her family said her disappearance was very out of character and police were concerned because of the girl's age.

'The teenager made contact with her family this evening,' Victoria Police said in a statement.

It was reported Si-Tian may frequent karaoke bars in the Melbourne CBD.

Police thanked the public and media for their help in the matter but declined to elaborate about the teenager's movements while she was reported missing. 

Si-Tian Wang, 15, who is known to visit Melbourne karaoke bars, was believed to be at one of these bars on the corner or Elizabeth St and Bourke St in the CBD before her disappearance.

Her distraught parents pleaded with their daughter to come home to media before her return.

'Si-Tian, we love you,' her father Jin He said.

'We really want you back home.' 

Si-Tian's inconsolable mother was too distressed to make a statement as she stood alongside her husband this afternoon.
