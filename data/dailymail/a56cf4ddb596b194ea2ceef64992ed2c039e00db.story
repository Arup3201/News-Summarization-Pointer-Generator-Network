Brave: Stephen has terminal cancer

There can't be many people who haven't heard about Stephen Sutton. I doubt it was ever his intention, but his handsome, young face, giving the thumbs up from his hospital bed, bidding the world a cheery farewell as he faced up to terminal cancer, has made him a global superstar.

After sharing his story with the world on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, he has raised more than £3 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust thanks to the kindness of friends and strangers.

Who could have failed to be delighted at the news he'd been sent home from hospital because he was feeling better and might have a few more months of life left after all? Not everyone, it would seem.

I've seen some terrible things in my life, but nothing to compare with the response to his news from social media trolls. They have truly surpassed themselves in their vileness.

'How disappointing he hasn't actually died as he said he would,' said one on Twitter. 'It's a con.'

Over on Facebook, the sneering and baiting continued: 'It feels like we're being conned. One minute he tweets he's dying and won't see the next day, then all of a sudden he's being released to go home.'

How could anyone say such things about this poor boy?

Stephen, now 19, has put a very brave face on it, telling them that  his bowel cancer, which first struck when he was just 15, is still terminal. But how must he have felt knowing there were people out there who would want him dead?

I know from experience what a fragile knife edge you're on when you have cancer, whether terminal or not, and I have written extensively about my own diagnosis with breast cancer in 2006. I remember veering wildly between courage and optimism, depression and despair. I can't imagine Stephen being any different and am aghast that anyone could risk bursting the little bubble of hope his return home must have given him and his family.

I made a vow a long time ago, never to ask: 'What is the world coming to?' It was an expression my mother used to show her displeasure at anything from short skirts to decimalisation, and it marked her out as a fuddy-duddy of the 'older generation', something I never wanted to be.

Support: Prime Minister David Cameron and celebrities have rallied round the teen but he's also received vile abuse from trolls

But no other expression came to mind this week. What is the world coming to when a young man, dying of cancer, who’s inspired the entire country, can be targeted by repulsive individuals hiding behind the cloak of anonymity the internet provides?

The world has come to the lowest point imaginable, where cruelty has become a competitive sport that thrives unchallenged on social media sites, where there are no measures to protect the weak and vulnerable.

Stephen's experience makes me certain free speech is not always the right approach.

We all, I guess, have the capacity for cruelty. We can all be bullies or jealous or react violently when provoked, but we generally control it. We’re taught that there are certain rules that must be obeyed or we’ll be shamed.

It's what keeps society ticking over, so we bite our tongues or sit on our hands because we don't want people to know what we may be  capable of.

And there's the crux: the world wide web continues to be a safe haven for online tribes who've discovered that you can get away with expressing all the horrid thoughts that you'd be too ashamed to say to anyone face to face.

Speaking from experience: Jenni knows how mean trolls can be

It's not only the young who find their vulnerability exploited. My cancer was eight years ago, before social media exploded, and the response to my being open about it was generally empathetic from people who signed their letters and emails. But that hasn't been the case since Facebook and Twitter took hold.

It's no secret that I'm overweight and I wear a scarf over one shoulder to cover up the slight imbalance in my chest area after my mastectomy.

Even a tough old bat like me, who decided not to go through the extensive surgery of full reconstruction, can feel self-conscious that there's one breast remaining and a chicken fillet stuffed into my bra on the other side.

I can't tell you how sick I am of being described by trolls as 'Jabba the Hutt with that stupid curtain over her shoulder.' Likewise, if I write about my experience in the hope of giving encouragement to others, it's pretty galling to get: 'There she goes - on about her bloody tits again' or worse: 'Shut up! Shame you didn't die, bitch!'

I never spit back, telling myself such people are beneath contempt, but it still hurts.

It's a game that does seem to have a uniquely British air about it; boost the ego of the ambitious on the way up - knock 'em on the way down.

The world-class swimmer Rebecca Adlington, who should have enjoyed nothing but adulation after her Olympic triumphs, was told how ugly she looked by a number of wicked idiots who couldn't see the beautiful, powerful woman the rest of us saw.

The brilliant classicist Professor Mary Beard merely appeared on Question Time and gave her opinions. The verbal online attacks on her were sexual, vulgar and frightening.

Mary fought back, successfully closing down the website from which the comments had emerged. But it takes a lot of courage and confidence to take on people who are threatening to harm you.

I like to think, as Stephen said, that 'on the whole, people are good; let's concentrate on that'.

But I'm not sure he's right. The potential for nastiness is in us all and when an environment exists, such as the internet, that enables severe breaches of the moral code to go unpunished, it may, I fear, continue to be unleashed.

A new low was plumbed last year following the death of leukaemia sufferer Amanda Slann, 17. She'd had a visit in hospital from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and appeared in the papers, which is perhaps why she attracted the envy of the trolls.

When her parents set up a memorial Facebook page for their daughter, it was defaced by sick comments threatening to desecrate her grave. Her parents, unsurprisingly, have called for tougher laws to prevent such anonymous postings.

Now, I'm not normally in favour of gagging, but in this instance I am with them all the way: shut down the cruel, pornographic sites which can only deaden humane sensibilities and work out a way of making sure the trolls are unable to hide behind anonymity. They're the ones who need to be named and shamed - not their innocent victims.

I admire Stephen Sutton's response: 'Trolls and cynics exist. It's a shame, but just try not to retaliate too aggressively or get too riled.'

I truly hope he is unaffected, but I think his analysis is wrong. I'm riled, and I think the Mary Beard response of fury and taking action is the correct one.

Stephen's story has brought into stark focus the best and worst of humanity.

There's the courage of a young man trying to make the best of what's left of his time on Earth and the heartless cowardice of those who seek to spread hate and destroy his peace of mind. It's essential we work hard to make sure it's Stephen who wins.
