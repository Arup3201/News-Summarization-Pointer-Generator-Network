Wealthy foreigners who buy and sell British property could face a new tax under plans being considered by George Osborne.

The Chancellor is looking at putting capital gains tax on the UK homes of foreign owners in his Autumn Statement next month.

Such a move could help curb the housing bubble in London and the South East, where demand for homes from Russian oligarchs and Middle Eastern investors has helped spark a price boom.

It is unclear how much the tax would raise but the Treasury is thought to have costed the measure.

British homeowners have to pay capital gains tax (CGT) – typically 28 per cent – if they make a profit when they sell a property that is not deemed to be their main residence.

But foreign investors are exempt from tax on all properties – making London homes in particular an attractive option.

The booming demand has sent property values across the capital soaring by an average of 10 per cent in the past year, pricing many locals out.

Estate agents Knight Frank believe 70 per cent of new-build properties in prime areas of Central London go to foreign buyers.

Experts say imposing CGT on foreign owners would do less damage to the UK housing market than the ‘mansion tax’ on homes worth more than £2million proposed by the Liberal Democrats.

Lucien Cook, a director at estate agent Savills, said: 'Proposals to tax the capital gains of non-UK resident property investors are a much more targeted and much less controversial solution to the perceived inequalities in the taxation of high value properties than a blanket mansion tax. This could significantly reduce the case for a mansion tax.'

He said 'it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under-taxed' in Britain.

But he added: 'This move could make some foreign investors reticent to buy property in London or current owners reluctant to sell.'

Grainne Gilmore, Knight Frank's head of UK residential research, said: 'Tax is not the primary reason why global property investors come to London, but a change of this sort would have an impact.'

The British Property Federation warned that new taxes on property will damage the UK's status as a country that is 'open for business' while doing little to curb rising prices.

Liz Peace, BPF chief executive, said: 'House prices are rising due to a chronic shortage of new homes, not because of foreign investors, and until this supply issue is dealt with it makes no sense to slap kneejerk taxes on people who want to spend money in the UK and contribute to the UK economy.

'Uncertainty of this kind is hugely damaging to Britain's image as a country that is open for business, and far outweighs the paltry sums which this tax would raise - indeed it is only with foreign investment that many London schemes are able to go ahead.

'We know from bitter experience that some foreign investors will have seen these headlines and will already be thinking twice about whether or not to invest in the UK.'
