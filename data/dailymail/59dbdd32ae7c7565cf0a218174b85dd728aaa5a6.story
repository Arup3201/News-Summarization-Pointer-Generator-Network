A charity worker was stabbed eight times by a stalker – despite making 120 calls to the police to beg for their help.

Over five years Helen Pearson, 34, was sent threatening letters, had a dead cat left on her doorstep and her locks were glued shut.

But she claims police did not take her warnings seriously, telling her there was not enough evidence to make an arrest.

Close call: Charity worker Helen Pearson, 34, pictured after her recovery, was stalked by loner Joe Willis, 49, for five years before he attempted to murder her by attacking her, dragging her into a graveyard, and stabbing her eight times

The harassment culminated in a violent attack in which her stalker, Joe Willis, 49, a loner she had taken pity on, dragged her into a graveyard and stabbed her with foot-long dressmaking scissors.

She nearly died at his hands and was only saved by a passer-by who pushed him off her. He was convicted of her attempted murder and will be sentenced next month.

Miss Pearson said she was glad Willis had tried to kill her because it meant that he was now facing a long prison sentence.

She said: ‘In a way the best thing happened that he did try to kill me because now they’ve got him for the stalking - he’ll go away for a very long time.

'If he’d been caught after posting one of his letters then he wouldn’t be facing life and I’m glad he is.’

Miss Pearson, from Exeter, has now made a formal complaint to Devon and Cornwall Police for failing to act on her repeated warnings.

She said: ‘The police had ample opportunity to catch him before he tried to kill me. The warning signs were loud and clear for five years.

‘Police must take stalking seriously - and have specially trained officers to deal with these violent, distressing crimes.’

Speaking of her horrific experience, the charity worker said that she had taken pity on Willis after his mother, her elderly neighbour, had asked her to talk to her lonely son.

But he became obsessed with her, despite her making it clear that nothing romantic would happen between them, and she found him waiting outside her flat building.

Offensive graffiti started to appear near her home, her bike and car tyres were slashed, glue was put in her door locks and she received threatening letters and texts.

She reported the incidents to police and suggested Willis as a suspect, but was told that they weren’t serious enough to warrant an investigation.

Soon, the harassment escalated and Miss Pearson found the words: ‘Die Helen, die’ daubed on a neighbour’s door in red paint. Her family and friends also received threatening letters.

By this time, she had become a recluse, quit her job and confined herself to her flat, too frightened to go out.

She also started recording the incidents and her repeated calls to police in a log covering 24 pages.

‘I often got the impression they were trying to imply I was doing all this to myself. It didn’t help that every time I reported the incident I got a new reference number and spoke to a different officer,’ she said.

‘The reports were never looked at as a whole, which meant the police weren’t getting the bigger picture.’

Recalling the horrific attack in which she nearly died, she said: ‘I felt a stabbing pain in my back. The sheer force of it pushed me to the ground and I was in total shock.

‘As I turned I saw it was Joe - and he stabbed me again. He was staring blankly at me and my pleas for him to stop seemed to spur him on. It was like he was getting strength from my screams.’

‘I was certain Joe was going to kill me and stuff my body into one of the graves. I kept thinking about my parents and how they might never find me,’ she added.

‘He kept punching me in the ribs and face and stabbing me over and over. Next thing I knew he’d rolled off me and I took the opportunity to run.’

The mental health charity worker was told by doctors that she was lucky to be alive after the wounds Willis inflicted narrowly missed major veins.

Devon and Cornwall Police would not comment but confirmed that a complaint had been received and referred to the IPCC.
