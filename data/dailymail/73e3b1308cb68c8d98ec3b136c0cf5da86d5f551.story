Robbie Kingsford was attacked in a homophobic hate crime on Saturday morning in Surbiton

Two thugs wearing pink tutus are being hunted by police after launching a savage homophobic attack on passers-by outside a YMCA.

The men were sitting outside the hostel with three women in the early hours when they began hurling gay abuse at their two victims, aged 18 and 21.

The attackers approached the two men and punched one before kicking and stamping on the other, who had fallen to the floor while trying to intervene.

The victim who was punched suffered minor facial injuries, while the other - named by a local newspaper as Robbie Kingsford, 21, after his father Brian posted an appeal for witnesses and a picture of his son's injuries on Facebook - was taken to hospital with head injuries and was later discharged.

The attack in Surbiton, Surrey, on Saturday morning, is being treated as a homophobic hate crime, although no arrests have yet been made.

The first suspect is described as a short, white man, in his late twenties, with fair hair, shaven and a muscular build and was wearing a pink tutu.

The second attack is also a white man in his late twenties, with brown short hair and also wearing a pink tutu.Â 

The YMCA in Surbiton, Surrey, was the scene of an alleged homophobic attack on Saturday

Trainee Detective Constable Ann-Marie Hodgkiss said: 'This was a violent and unprovoked hate crime and I am appealing for anyone with any information about the incident to contact me.

'The two suspects were distinctively dressed, probably due to Halloween, and I would urge anyone who recognises their description and who may know who they are to contact me and help us trace them.'
