Police are hunting two men who held a gun to a woman's head in western Sydney after breaking into her home while her children slept.

The two thieves, who gained entry through a window to the Dean Park home near Blacktown, confronted the mother-of-two in the hallway of her home where one held a gun to her head demanding money, police said.

The mother was at home with her two-year-old boy and one-year-old girl when the robbery took place shortly before midnight on Tuesday.

The children were both sleeping while the father, Kevin Mahe, was at work.

Police said the woman was alerted to a noise in the garage when she confronted the balaclava-clad men in the hallway brandishing a kitchen knife.

She was forced to drop the weapon when one of the men held a gun to her head demanding money and a mobile phone.

Both fled with $300 and a mobile phone.

A police spokesman said none of the two children were injured during the ordeal.

'The woman and her children were uninjured during the incident,' police said.

A disbelieved husband, Kevin Mahe, told the Nine Network that the robbery was 'just unbelievable'.

'It's just unbelievable they have no regard for anyone else...they're out there just ruining people,' he said..

He said nobody should need to live in fear of being robbed at gunpoint.

'This is not America.'

Local police and the dog squad have been searching for the men while officers also investigate CCTV footage of the area.
