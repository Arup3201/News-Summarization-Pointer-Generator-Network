A record-breaking wide receiver for Boston College is giving up a chance at playing in the NFL to become a U.S. Navy SEAL.

Alex Amidon, a 22-year-old senior from Greenfield, Massachusetts, smashed the school's records for the most receiving yards and was ranked 11th in the country for most receiving yards in 2012.

The college paper, the BC Interruption, noted that his announcement at a football dinner on Wednesday night came as 'a shock'.

'The 2012 All-ACC wide receiver most likely would have found a home in the NFL,' the paper reported, adding: 'The
 fact that Amidon is willing to give everything he has is truly 
awe-inspiring.

Saying goodbye: Alex Amidon, a record-breaking wide receiver for Boston College, is giving up football for a career in the military, he revealed on Wednesday evening to the shock of his peers

'Through making this decision, Amidon is truly showing 
that he is a man for others, and cares so deeply about his community and
 country.'

Amidon set the school's all-time record for most receiving yards in a season - 1024 this year - and the most receiving yards in a career. In 2012, he finished 11th in the country with 1210 yards.

In January, The Republican in Massachusetts reported that he was rated 31st out of 410 
draft-eligible wide receivers and had shined when pitched against some of the top players.

Despite these stellar results, Amidon was not invited to the NFL Scouting 
Combine - although NFL.com said he 'demonstrated great NFL potential and likely could have 
been a third-day pick', meaning he could have had a chance at a career with the league.

Family: Amidon is studying towards an English degree at Boston College - following in the footsteps of his parents, who are both writers. He will begin his military career after graduating in summer

Amidon himself admitted that he has never really paid attention to his records.

'To be honest, I never really gave the 
records much thought during the season and I still haven't,' Amidon told The Republican in January. 'Perhaps a little further down the line 
I'll reflect on them and what it all means, but I'm not at that point 
yet.'

Amidon was born in London and moved to the U.S. with his parents and three sisters when he was eight and gravitated towards football and track before opting to study for an English degree at BC.

Military careers do not seem to run in his family, who are more literary minded.

His father, Stephen Amidon, is a published author and film critic now based in Boston. One of his books, Something Like the Gods, is dedicated to his football player son.

His mother, Carol Casson, is an assistant Professor of English at MassBy Community College and has taught at other colleges, including Smith and Amherst. She too is a writer.

Last month, speaking to The Republic, he expressed uncertainty about pursuing a career in the NFL and said focusing on his studies was at the top of his list.

'Right now, I'm looking 
forward to graduating in June with a degree in English and enjoying my 
last semester in college,' he said.
