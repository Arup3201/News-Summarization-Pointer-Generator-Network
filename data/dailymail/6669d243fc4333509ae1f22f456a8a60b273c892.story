Manchester United utility man Daley Blind believes his move to Old Trafford has improved him as a player.

After spending 16-years with Ajax, the Holland international arrived at United in the summer as one of Louis van Gaal's first season recruits - having impressed under the Dutch manager at the 2014 World Cup.

The 25-year-old's debut season has been disrupted by injury, with a knee problem keeping him sidelined between November and January, but he has been influential on his return.

The Dutchman has been used in a variety of positions, playing at left-back and then in midfield in the recent victories over Tottenham and Liverpool respectively. And Blind reveals it's the demands of the Premier League that has forced him to improve.

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, he said: 'In the Premier League, you have to grow.

'I noticed that the rhythm of the game is much higher. The games just went much faster than in the Netherlands. That comes in handy for me in the Dutch national team, and also in my career.

'When you develop yourself, you can become a more complete player and that's what I want - to get better every day, to learn little things; and these should naturally be reflected in the game.'
