A New York man is being sued by his neighbors for allegedly allowing his children to take drugs and have threesomes on the roof of their luxury apartment building.

Richard Kempter, 73, is accused of letting cannabis-fuelled parties take place in his one-bedroom flat when he is not around, leaving the entire Manhattan high-rise reeking of marijuana.

But Mr Kempter has hit back saying that the lawsuit is racially motivated and targets his personal guests, as his children live miles away in a different state.

Sue for smell: The neighbors allege that Mr Kempter, who lives on the eight floor of this building on the Upper East Side, allows his children to smoke cannabis and have sex on the roof when he is away

‘My children are 40 years old and live in Michigan,’ the university psychology lecturer told the NY Daily News, adding that the ‘racist neighborhood’ does not approve of his black friends.

Although management of the co-op owned high-rise received the lawsuit yesterday, the feud between Mr Kempter and his neighbors has been going on for years.

‘I opened my dishwasher on a clean load of dishes and the smell was overwhelming,’ a neighbor wrote to management of the Upper East Side building in January 2010, blaming ‘Richard’s stepson’.

Last January another complained: ‘It is 10.45pm and my apartment smells like a party was going on… the stench of musty pot that is lingering in my closet is unbearable.’

The lawsuit also includes accusations of 
‘lewd behavior’ after a woman, named in the lawsuit as ‘Chrissy’, was 
caught on CCTV going up to the roof terrace with two men after dark, 
which is prohibited by co-op rules.

No to smoke: Neighbours say the cannabis smoke from the 'wild parties' in Mr Kempter's one-bedroom flat has spread throughout the building into their homes - even into their dishwashers and closets

Mr Kempter, who has lived in the building for 12 years, said he was aware that there had been complaints regarding his guests ‘getting rowdy’, and admitted that his friends ‘probably did have sex’ on the roof, but that the issues have already been resolved.

The board of the co-op building had voted for him to be kicked out of the flat in march, but after Mr Kempter promised that the wild parties would stop he was allowed to stay.

‘I think there’s a racial issue here,’ he told the paper, adding that his friends named in the suit are all African-American.

‘This is a very racist neighborhood.’

The co-op is seeking $15,000 in damages, plus payment from Kempter for their legal bills.
