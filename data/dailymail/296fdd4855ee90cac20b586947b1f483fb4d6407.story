James Burdall caused 350 people to lose their jobs while he spent money on swimming pools and fine art in a £1.2million scam

A fraudster’s £1.2million scam caused 350 people to lose their jobs while he spent the money on swimming pools and fine art.

James Burdall, 49, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, stole the money from the ice cream business of his closest friend, who had trusted him with his livelihood after suffering a heart attack.

But instead of ensuring his friend’s business continued to be a success, as well as keeping his employees in work, Burdall immediately started transferring money into his account.

He used the money to buy an indoor swimming pool, fine art, a private school education for his children and landscaped gardens.

Burdall admitted four counts of fraud by abuse of position at an earlier hearing, and appeared for sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court today.

He was sentenced to four years imprisonment for each charge, to be served concurrently.

South Yorkshire Police’s financial crime investigation unit began a complex and protracted investigation into Burdall’s activities in July 2010, following allegations made by Sheffield entrepreneur Lawrence Wosskow.

Mr Wosskow was the owner of Bradwells Ice Cream Limited, as well as the Out of Town Leisure Group Limited, a holding that operated a number of food outlets at shopping centres across the UK - the majority of which were at the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield.

After suffering a heart attack in 2006, Mr Wosskow made the decision to emigrate with his family and left Burdall to oversee his businesses.

But, from the very start of their arrangement, Burdall started to transfer funds from the accounts of Mr Wosskow’s companies to the accounts of his own business.

From here, much of the money went to his own personal accounts where it was used to fund a lavish lifestyle.

All this was done without the knowledge or permission of Mr Wosskow, who had no idea that Burdall was draining funds from his companies.

But in July 2010, Mr Wosskow received information from a business associate and challenged Burdall as to his actions. 

Burdall admitted to taking money from Mr Wosskow’s companies, but it was some days later before the full extent of his dishonesty came to light.

It was then determined that the Out of Town Leisure Group could not be saved and it was placed into administration, leading to the loss of around 350 jobs.

Most of these were at Meadowhall, where workers arrived at the Oasis food court to see the shutters down on the food outlets.

Graham Wragg, fraud manager at South Yorkshire Police, said: ‘Burdall’s actions can only be described as the cynical abuse of the trust and friendship placed in him by Lawrence Wosskow.

‘In his self-serving pursuit of an extravagant lifestyle he caused the loss of the livelihood of 350 ordinary individuals and risked further damage to the health of his former friend.

‘I would like to commend all those who worked tirelessly on this investigation, for several years, in order to bring Burdall to justice today.’

Mr Wosskow said that the actions of his former friend had a devastating impact on he and his family.

He said: ‘James and I had been friends since our schooldays and, after our paths went in separate directions, we met up again in 2005 through a mutual love of cycling.

‘We quickly became best friends and, when I suffered a heart attack a year later, James was very supportive.

After suffering a heart attack in 2006, Mr Wosskow made the decision to emigrate with his family and he left Burdall to oversee his businesses. This is what he spent the money on

‘He became my closest friend and, when me and my family emigrated for the good of my health, he was the person I thought could be best trusted to oversee my businesses.

‘His actions have had a huge impact on my health and also my finances, as when the Out of Town group was placed into administration Bradwells ice cream company was also in a very precarious position.

‘Owing to a promise I had made when buying the company in 1992, I had no choice but to honour that promise and save the company - which I did by injecting a considerable sum of money into it.

‘I am very glad that he has now been brought to justice and will pay for his crimes, which left hundreds of hard-working people out of work through no fault of their own.’
