Silvio Berlusconi hired more than 30 women, including actresses and prostitutes, to attend his private parties, Italian investigators allege.

They said they had intercepted more than 100,000 conversations and telephone calls following a two-year probe into the allegations.

There are reports the calls involve 
Berlusconi himself talking about nights spent with the escorts and 
commenting on their performances.

The investigators said at least 30 women were invited to his parties, and than many 'prostituted themselves' with the leader in return for cash and other gifts, the Daily Telegraph said.

They now want charges to be brought against
 eight people said to have supplied the Italian Prime Minisiter with 
women for parties he hosted at his official residences in Rome, Milan 
and Sardinia between 2008 and 2009.

Some of the women were from South America and Eastern Europe.

Italian actress Manuela Arcuri was allegedly promised the 
chance to host the annual San Remo musical festival in exchange for 
sleeping with Mr Berlusconi, but turned down the offer.

Investigators say Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi recruited more than 30 women for his parties

Others named in the list leaked to the Italian press - who have dubbed it 'a harem' - included Patrizia 
D'Addario, a self-confessed call girl, Ioanna Visan, a Romanian showgirl and underwear model Francesca Lana.

Aspiring showgirls Sara Tommasi, Barbara Guerra and Barbara Montereale were also on the list.

Berlusconi has always denied any 
knowledge that the women were escorts and that he paid for sex insisting
 he could 'never understand people who pay for sex as there is no thrill
 of the chase.'

His legal team are said to be frantically trying to have the intercepted calls ruled out as evidence in any potential trial.

In Italy, wiretaps and listening devices are used extensively as part of prosecution cases and investigations.

Among the eight people who could face charges are businessman Giampaolo Tarantini, who is already under investigation for his part in an alleged blackmail plot against Berlusconi.

He is said to have paid him more than Â£660,000 in hush money so as not to reveal details of the prostitutes.

Besides
 Tarantini there is also Sabina Began, 36, a German actress who calls 
herself the 'Queen Bee' when it comes to Berlusconi and who earlier this
 year claimed in an interview that the under pressure politician had 
'helped her find God.'

Investigators will now ask a judge to formally charge the eight people in connection to 28 offences ranging from procuring prostitutes to criminal association.

Sabina Began, said to the 'queen bee' of Berlusconi's girls, allegedly recruited three women for a party he hosted in Rome

The inquiry began in 2009 after 
Tarantini's name hit the headlines when it emerged he had arranged for 
the escorts to attend parties Berlusconi hosted at his residences in 
Rome and Sardinia and photographs of the women in one of his bathrooms 
later emerged.

Patrizia D'Addario, 42, said she was 
paid to spend the night with the media tycoon and later went on to write
 a book in which she praised Berlusconi, 74, for his sexual performance 
adding that he deserved a 'place in the Guinness Book of Records.'

Investigators say that Tarantini, Began and the others were in charge 
of recruiting the women for the parties and were paid for their efforts 
or had other favours in return such as contracts for business ventures.

In separate but linked cases prosecutors are looking into allegations that drugs were also supplied.

Details of the allegations and telephone calls were revealed in official prosecution documents deposited at the main court building in Bari and which a judge will now go through to decide if there is enough evidence for the charges to be be brought against the eight people named.

In a statement the Bari prosecutor's office confirmed the investigation had officially closed and said: 'This case began in the summer of 2009 and since then more than 100,000 telephone calls and other intercepted conversations with listening devices have been transcribed and those that have been deemed relevant form part of the file asking for charges to be brought against eight people.'

The files revealed how Miss Began had allegedly recruited three women for a party Berlusconi hosted at his Rome residence Palazzo Grazioli.

Italian actresses Manuela Arcuri refused the offer to sleep with Berlusconi

Earlier this summer Miss Began, who has a tattoo dedicated to Berlusconi on her ankle, told an Italian radio show about her relationship with the politician and said: 'He loves God, he speaks to God. He is a believer and thanks to him I have become religious as well.

'He is a very spiritual man. He has helped me to find faith and his home is decorated with crucifixes. He is very spiritual and he has put me on a spiritual path.'

Berlusconi himself is not suspected or accused of any wrong doing in Bari case which is different to the infamous 'bunga bunga' investigation which has led to him being accused of having sex with an underage prostitute.

The pharse 'bunga bunga' is said to refer to crude after-dinner sex games played at Berlusconi's home near Milan by female guests who were invited there.

Among them a then 17-year-old belly dancer called Karima El Mahroug who, prosecutors say was paid in cash and jewellery along with 32 other women who attended the parties.

In Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying for sex with a girl below 18 is seen as under-age prostitution and carries a maximum three year jail sentence.

As part of the same case Berlusconi is also accused of abusing his position as prime minister, using his influence to secure Miss El Mahroug's release from police custody after she was arrested in connection with a 3,000 Euro theft.

Berlusconi denies all over the charges.
