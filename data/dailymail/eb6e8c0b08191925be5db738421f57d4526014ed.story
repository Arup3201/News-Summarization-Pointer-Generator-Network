Goodness only knows what a pilot was doing with a 40-calibre H&K pistol in his luggage, but he'll certainly be regretting it now.

A JetBlue pilot is facing a weapons possession charge after a gun was found in his bag during a screening at LaGuardia Airport in New York.

Robert Paulson, 47, of Ankeny, Iowa, was going through screening procedures last Thursday, according to a criminal complaint.

The Transportation Security Administration screener saw something metal in the x-ray, which turned out to be the H&K pistol, the complaint said.

The TSA agent also spotted a magazine with 10 live rounds inside his backpack in Terminal A, sources told the New York Post.

Paulson had been in New York for at least the day and was taking the flight to go back home to Iowa, the complaint said.

He was reportedly ‘deadheading’ - an aviation term for taking a free ride.

Paulson allegedly admitted the gun was his own and 'forgot' it was there.

The pilot also allegedly said he had no license to carry the gun in New York State, reported the New York Post.

Paulson was arraigned and released on his own recognisance, with his next court appearance set for later this month.

He has not yet commented. JetBlue said it was cooperating with the investigation but would not share any further details.

JetBlue is a U.S. low-cost airline based in Queens, New York, which flies to more than 50 destinations.
