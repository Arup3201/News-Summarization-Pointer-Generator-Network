A woman whose husband was killed in a tragic boating accident while the family were holidaying in Fiji has spoken of her heartbreak for the first time.

Mark Hardaker was on a fishing trip off Mana Island in May when, just 50 metres from shore at the end of a two hour trip, another boat slammed into their vessel, killing him instantly.

The father of three's wife, Vanessa Hardaker, told A Current Affair he was supposed to be going jet-skiing but made the switch to fishing because the high-powered machines were booked out - to the relief of his wife who thought fishing was the safer option.

Vanessa Hardaker spoke for the first time about losing her husband Mark and her struggle in coming to terms with being a single mum

Speaking of the last time she ever saw her husband, Mrs Hardaker said: 'I saw him walk away, walk down to the beach... and he never came back.'

The Hardakers, from Toongabbie in NSW, were on vacation with another family on what Mrs Hardaker described as their dream holiday to celebrate her 40th birthday.

Their three kids Georgia, Sam and Jake were 'beside themselves with excitement' as they had never been on a plane before or overseas.

One the day he died Mr Hardaker had gone out to sea with Sasha, the husband of Mrs Hardaker's closest friend Tracey.

Just 15 minutes before the accident that claimed his life, the two men switched seats. Sasha told the program he lives with the guilt every day.

'You question it every day. Why am I here? And he's not,' Sasha admitted through tears.

Tracey was the one who had to break the news to her devastated friend,, who said she knew it was bad news by the look on her face.

'And then I had to go back and tell the kids.' Mrs Hardaker recalled, before saying the last thing she expected to be doing the next day was making funeral arrangements on her 40th birthday.

Mrs Hardaker, now a single stay at home mum, revealed the struggles - both financially and emotionally - that the family has faced since her husband's death.

They were in the middle of renovations on their house, and many unfinished jobs and rooms are waiting to be completed by a husband who will not return.

A Fijian man who was driving the boat which crashed into Mr Hardaker's has been charged with manslaughter.

Jimi Beti, 33, was also charged with criminal recklessness and negligence over the death. It is understood he did not have a boat license.

Sasha recalled that the other boat looked overcrowded, but there were only four men on board their vessel.

After Mr Hardaker's death tributes poured in from family and friends who described the man as thoughtful, selfless and a devoted father.
