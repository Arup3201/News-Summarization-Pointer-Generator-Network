Friends of the Georgia man accused of killing his infant son earlier this month by leaving the boy in his hot car as he went to work say that before the child's death, Justin Ross Harris lived a happy life with his wife and his young son.

Friends describe Harris - whose friends refer to as Ross - and his wife, Leanna, as being the 'most proud parents there ever could have been' when their son Cooper was born about two years ago.

Other friends echo the praise for the young couple, who use words like 'nice' and 'friendly' to describe the man of intentionally killing his own son by leaving him in a scorching vehicle on a hot summer day.

Suspicions are growing about what role Leanna Harris, the wife of Justin Ross Harris, may have played in the death of their 22-month-old son Cooper in the wake of her husband's preliminary hearing on Thursday

'Very nice, normal, mannered person. We'd
 see each other passing, say hi,' Cathy Ferguson, a neighbor in couple's 
Marietta, Georgia neighborhood, told WSBTV.

The Harris' landlord, Joe Saini, also gave the couple a glowing review to local media outlets.

'Everything was going right for this 
couple,' Saini told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'They wanted to buy a house so they could have some
 space for their child to run around the backyard.'

Other
 friends weighed in on the couple on a Change.org petition to have the 
murder charge against Harris dropped. The petition was recently shut 
down.

'Ross is an incredible friend,' William 
Bryant of Houston, Texas wrote. 'He’s always the first to help when 
tragedy strikes others, so I’m returning the favor to him.'

Friend Matt Wiley had similar things to say about his longtime pal.

'I have known this man for years,' Wiley wrote. 'He is a great friend, a great 
husband and a great father.'

Aftermath: Guests leave the funeral for Cooper Harris after hearing an emotional call from father Ross from prison as he said goodbye last month

Harris
 has since pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and child cruelty. It
 was recently revealed that both he and his wife had done Google 
searches pertaining to children killed in hot cars prior to their son's 
death. Leanna Harris has not been charged with any crimes in the boy's 
June 18, death.

Justin 
Harris has already told police that he used the internet to research 
child deaths in vehicles and what temperature it needs to be for death 
to occur, police said.

‘Justin stated that he was fearful that this could happen,’ a police affidavit released on Saturday said.

The statement was written in order to gain permission
from the court to search Harris’ apartment in Marietta, Georgia.

During a police search executed on Wednesday June 18
officers seized a laptop computer, a computer tower, a Google Chromecast and other electronic devices. Harris’ white AT&T IPhone 5, was also seized by
cops.

This comes after it was alleged the Home Depot web
developer also used his work computer to research how long it would take for a
dog to die inside a hot car.

Suspicious: Police say Justin Ross Harris admitted to researching child death shortly before son Cooper Harris was declared dead in a shopping center parking lot

The
 father is charged with murder and second-degree child cruelty in his 
son's death, and remained in jail on Saturday as family members held a 
funeral in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

service  and with his voice breaking he was heard saying: 'I'm sorry... Thank you for everything you've done, I'm sorry, I love
you, thank you.'

Justin Harris listened in to friends and family as they shared
memories with mourners in the stage.

And in an emotional speech Harris' wife Leanna took
to the stage to defend her husband.

She asked the congregation: 'Am I angry with Ross?
Absolutely not. It never ever has crossed my mind. Ross is and always will be,
if we have more children, a wonderful daddy, a wonderful leader for our
children.'

She added: 'Cooper meant the world to him, there was
not a day go by that we did not say how blessed we were to have him in our
lives.'

Leanna said she had felt compelled to speak in
defense of her husband and remember Cooper.

She told him as he listened in: 'Ross I love you, I
am doing this for you okay.

'I should be crumpled in a heap of snot and tears
into the dirt, but The Lord is holding me up...he is holding Ross up.'

Forgiveness: Hearing Ross's words wife Leanna told the crowd she believed in her husband

Harris described Cooper as peaceful with his eyes closed, when this wasn't the case, according to Stoddard. He allegedly also told his wife: 'I dreaded how he would look'

Not welcome: Justin Ross Harris was banned from the funeral for Cooper held at the University Church of Christ

Leanna also recalled bringing 6lbs 8oz Cooper in to
the world.

'He was perfect,' she said, adding, 'He changed my
life and he changed Ross' life.'

She also recalled how Cooper had struggled to sleep
in the two nights before his death and had spent the night sleeping in between
her and Ross in their bed.

She remembers waking and looking at him.

'I will cherish that moment forever.'

Earlier a family member had come on to the stage and
asked the audience to join him in a round of applause for baby Cooper.

After the claps slowed, the man said: 'Hey Ross that
sounded pretty good.'

To which Ross responded: 'Yes it did.'

Leanna's father Dock Taylor spoke of Cooper as a
'wonderful little man'.

'He lived full for 22-months of his life.

'His family loved and adored and worshipped him and
we will for the rest of our days.'

He added that 'nobody in this world' loved him more
than Ross and Leanna.

He said Harris called him his 'handsome little
buddy'.

Harris could be heard crying over the phone as Mr
Taylor spoke and the religious service progressed.

Investigating: An updated arrest warrant shows Justin Harris took his 22-month-old son, Cooper, to breakfast shortly before the little boy was left to die in a hot SUV

Celebrating life: A family member came on to the stage and asked the audience to join him in a round of applause for baby Cooper

Harris, 33, was supposed to drop Cooper
at daycare around 9.30am on June 18 but instead went straight to work after
first stopping for breakfast at a Chick-Fil-A restaurant.

He forget the boy was strapped in his car seat in the
back of the Hyundai Tuscon for seven hours - on a day when temperatures soared
into the 90s.

Baby Cooper wasn’t discovered until 4.20 p.m. after
Harris has left work and suddenly pulled into a parking lot at Uncle Maddio’s
Pizza restaurant at a nearby shopping center.

According to the search warrants Harris ‘quickly
exited the vehicle opened the driver side passenger door and pulled his child,
Cooper Harris out of the vehicle.’

It continued: ‘Justin was witnessed yelling 'Oh
my god what have I done.' He then began doing CPR on the child. When
someone came to assist Justin he stopped providing medical attention to the
child and started making calls on his cell phone.

Memories: Mourners recalled Cooper as a happy boy who loved cars and trucks

Friends had previously described Harris and his wife as being the 'most proud parents there ever could have been' over their son Cooper

EMS responded to the scene. It
was obvious that the child was deceased.

But witnesses told MailOnline that Harris was 'acting
oddly' and that he had told bystanders who tried to save the tot that the child
had been ‘choking’ minutes earlier.

Instead of confessing to the tragic blunder of having
left the child in the car all day – and admitting his baby had been dead for
hours – it was claimed Harris had tried to cover his tracks.

The mystery deepened even further when the police
later revealed that Harris had returned to his SUV at lunchtime and was seen
placing an object in the car via the driver’s side door.

Leanna
wanted to obtain photos of her son from the seized computers for use at the
funeral, but Cobb County police turned down her request, said Maddox Kilgore,
the attorney for Harris.

According to a police affidavit released on Sunday, Cobb County police say Leanna Harris has admitted to researching child deaths in hot cars online, but has not been charged

The service was attended
by Cooper’s mum Leanna, his grandparents on both sides and several aunts and
uncles.

Pastor David Eldridge
spoke and gave the opening prayer followed by sentiments from family and
friends.

After the service the
family will lay Cooper to rest in a private burial.

A charity fund at The Home
Depot where Harris works, will pay for the funeral.

On Thursday a petition,
which had attracted more than 11,000 online signatures and calling for the
murder charges against Harris to be dropped, was taken down.

Mourning: Mother Leanna wanted to obtain photos of her son from the seized computers for use at the funeral, but Cobb County police turned down her request, said Maddox Kilgore, the attorney for Harris

A wave of
supporters initially said the charges against the Home Depot worker were
outrageous and that it was an accident.

The petition on Change-org demanding that the charges be dropped and the case
sparked national debate.

But
 as more details in the case emerged, support group Parents Support 
Parents - the people behind the petition - decided to close it down.

In the obituary the family
asks that in lieu of flowers donations should be made to the Homer Fund.

They thanked everyone who
had supported them through this trying time.

They wrote: ‘The
outpouring of love has been tremendously over-whelming in the best possible
way.’
