An Adelaide man has been refused bail after allegedly attacking a cabin crew attendant on a flight to Sydney.

Andrew Nankivell, 30, is accused of launching the drunken assault during a flight from the Gold Coast on Thursday night between 7:30 and 7:45pm.

The incident caused the pilot to send an emergency radio transmission and police arrested Nankivell at Sydney domestic terminal after the aircraft landed as scheduled.

Andrew Nankivell, 30, could face up to 10 years in prison for launching a drunken assault on cabin crew during a flight from the Gold Coast to Sydney on Thursday night

The butcher and father of one from Findon, in Adelaide's west, appeared at Sydney's Central Local Court on Friday afternoon charged with assaulting the cabin crew staffer, endangering aircraft safety and offensive and disorderly behaviour on an aircraft.

The offences, if proved, carry a combined jail term of more than 10 years.

Federal police allege Nankivell was disruptive on the flight after becoming intoxicated, before he became abusive towards members of the crew and launching an assault against the attendants.

Magistrate John Bailey heard that he has a number previous convictions for alcohol and violence-related offences.

He refused a bail application that would have allowed Nankivell to travel back to Adelaide, where he has joint custody of his six-year-old daughter.

'The accused has been charged with some serious offences,' Mr Bailey told the court.

'Acting like that within an aircraft puts other people at some risk and it's a matter of some great concern.

'I've no doubt this came about because of the intoxication of the accused.

'If we look at his record interstate there are matters of violence on his record, there are also matters in relation to alcohol.'

The case was adjourned until June 25.

The incident has come after a number of other recent mid-air drama's, including the restraining and arrest of a man on a Virgin Australia flight to Bali from Brisbane.

Matt Christopher Lockley, 28, sparked fears of a hijacking after he began banging on the door of the cockpit, mistaking it for a bathroom in late April.
