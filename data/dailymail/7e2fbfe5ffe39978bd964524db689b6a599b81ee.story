A patient recovering from surgery no doubt feels much better after winning $7 million after his father tucked a lottery ticket into his get-well card.

Joseph Amorese, of Easton, Pennsylvania received the ticket from his father, who lives in the hamlet of Congers in Rockland County, New York as he recovered from hernia surgery.

A few scratches later on the '$7 million Golden Ticket' and he was feeling great.

'I scratched the ticket and it was a good thing I was already sitting down because I was shocked. I was - and still am - in complete disbelief,' Amorese said at a check presentation on Wednesday.

Shock: Amorese, who was recovering from surgery when he scratched off the card, said he wanted to jump up and down with excitement but couldn't. 'In my mind I was jumping up and down,' he said

'I had surgery so I didn't jump up and down, but in my mind I was jumping up and down.'

He sent a photo of the ticket to his father, whom he called 'a retired hospital administrator-turned-avid Lottery player', who agreed that it was a winner.

The 46-year-old senior project manager for Verizon then called his wife Jodi, a social worker.

When he said, 'Honey, I think we won $7 million,' he was met by a long, stunned silence, he said.

'She was too stunned to talk,' he said. 

His 'avid Lottery player' father bought the ticket for him from Just A Dollar in New City, New York

Lottery officials presented Amorese with a ceremonial check at the Just A Dollar store store in New City, New York, where the ticket was purchased. 

A CBS reporter asked if it healed the hernia any faster and Amorese laughed and responded: 'All the pain I felt, I did not feel for at least a couple of days.'

The couple collected a lump sum of $4.5 million and said they plan to keep their jobs. 

The chances of hitting the jackpot are just one in 3,708,000.
