These extraordinary pictures show how a series of blasts from exploding shells rocked a Russian military test site today and released giant clouds of smoke over a city.

The explosions broke windows and released smoke over Orenburg near the Kazakhstan border, with one military officer taken to hospital - but no other injuries reported.

The enormous blasts were set off by a fire that may have been caused by someone smoking at the Donguz test site, military prosecutor Yevgeny Ivanov told state television.

The shells were being unloaded from a supply train in crates in preparation for future disposal. More than 4,000 tons of ammunition exploded - including aviation bombs and rockets, local reports said.

Military officials have opened a criminal investigation into the suspected mishandling of weapons.

All 300 people working in the area fled after the fire broke out - just before the explosions - and 10,000 inhabitants from two local towns were evacuated, reported the International Business Times.

'Commander issued an order to leave the premises,' a witness told Russian newspaper Izvestia. 'We dropped everything and fled. Otherwise all the 300 people would have been killed.'

Orenburg Governor Yuri Berg wrote on his blog today that the three explosions were caused by unplanned shell detonations. He said emergency services saw no potential harm to local residents.

buildings and nearby villages as a precautionary measure.

The site is located 25 miles from Orenburg. Only two weeks ago, the head of a group carrying out the munitions disposal at Donguz was killed.

Russian military equipment, which frequently dates back to the Soviet era, has exploded unexpectedly several times at test sites in recent years. Some accidents have been blamed on safety violations.

President Vladimir Putin has pledged to overhaul and modernise the country's defence industry.
