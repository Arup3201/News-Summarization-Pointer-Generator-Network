Dutch police have had to issue an apology after a 'single colleague' posted an April Fool's message online saying that a major section of the country's motorway would be closed today.

The message - posted on the national police website -  claimed that 20 miles of the A2 motorway between the Dutch capital Amsterdam and Utrecht would be closed for filming of BBC's Top Gear's attempt to set a new world speed record on a public road.

A police spokesman told the Telegraph: 'This is obviously not the intention. It was an action of a single colleague who did not think about the possible consequences.'

Dutch police have issued an apology after an April Fool's message appeared on its website saying that a major section of the country's motorway would be closed while BBC's Top Gear filmed an attempt to set a new world speed record

The mock 'warning' was posted on the national police website on Easter Monday morning.

It remained stayed online but was removed after an hour after the public began to inquire about the road closure.

The fake message said that Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May,  would use the motorway on 1 April to try and break a world record speed record of 268 miles per hour on a public highway.

It claimed that 20 miles of the 10 lane A2 motorway between the Dutch capital Amsterdam and Utrecht would be closed for filming

The Dutch justice ministry said 'police organisation quickly moved to avoid confusion after a thoughtless action.'

The Dutch are known for their fondness of April Fool jokes, and their love of pranks goes back 440 years with roots in the Dutch war against Spain for the country's independence.

On 1 April 1572, Dutch rebels conquered the town of Den Briel, marking a major victory in the struggle against the rule of Spain and a garrison commanded by Lord Alva.

To commemorate the victory, and a successful April Fool trick, the Dutch say, 'Op 1 april, Verloor Alva zijn Bril' or 'On April first, Lord Alva lost his glasses', a pun on the word 'Bril', meaning spectacles and Briel, the name of the town.
