President Barack Obama has two important jobs - leading the country, and being father to two teenage girls. Now he has opened up about the latter and what it takes to raise kids in the White House.

In an interview with former first daughter Jenna Bush Hager on the Today show, the President tells her that 15-year-old Malia and 13-year-old Sasha think of him as 'a good, fun dad who teeters on the edge of being embarrassing sometimes.

'As Malia put it, I'm right on the edge,' he said. 'But I usually stay on the right side of the edge of being funny rather than totally humiliating to them.'

His most important job: President Barack Obama opened up to Jenna Bush Hager about raising two teen girls in the White House in a new episode of the Today show

Despite sometimes embarrassing his girls like any other dad, Obama says they maintain a close relationship and make an effort to be open with each other about their feelings.

'The one thing the girls know about me is I love 'em to death,' he said.

'Younger parents… ask me why it is that Malia and Sasha turned out so well. I say, "Well, first of all, you know - marry somebody who's going to be a great mom," which I did. But second of all, unconditional love sure makes a difference.'

As the daughter of former President George W Bush, Jenna - who gave birth to her her first child, a daughter named Mila, in April 2013 - has a unique firsthand perspective on families in the White House.

And while she told Obama that she and her twin sister Barbara sometimes struggled with overhearing criticism of their father, it seems Malia and Sasha are relatively indifferent.

'Up until recently they have shown absolutely no interest in what I did,' he confessed, explaining that it helps resolve any issues when they discuss his political decisions during dinnertime.

Appreciation: 'It goes by quick,' said the father of 15-year-old Malia and 13-year-old Sasha. 'Understand that there's nothing that's going to be more precious in your life, and you are going to savor every memory'

'I explain to them, "Here's why I made a decision that I made,"' he said. ' And so in some ways, they're getting a sense of how I think through problems.'

Balancing fatherhood with presidential duties is undoubtedly a challenge, especially with two teen girls.

'The one thing the girls know is I love 'em to death -unconditional love sure makes a difference'

To get his take on it, Jenna asked Obama: 'What is harder, being a protective father of teenagers or President of the United States?'

Smiling as he considered his answer, the President joked that living in the White House actually makes fatherhood easier, to an extent.

'Well, as you know, and you may have chafed under this a little bit, they do have a Secret Service detail,' he said.

Savor the moments: 'When you're on your death bed, that's the stuff you're going to remember - you holding hands with your daughter,' Obama told Jenna (pictured together in an Instagram snap)

'I've joked that the main reason I ran for reelection was to sustain that all the way through their high school years.'

On a more serious note, however, the father-of-two added that the most important part of parenthood is appreciating every moment of it.

'It goes by quick,' he said, advising: 'Don't just
 spend time with your kids because it's good for the kids; understand 
that there's nothing that's going to be more precious in your life, and you
 are going to savor every memory.

'And when you're on your death 
bed, that's the stuff you're going to remember - you holding hands with 
your daughter and taking them to the park and pushing them on a swing and hearing them laugh… You just want to make sure you don't miss out on that.'

White House living: Although Jenna (middle) and her twin sister Barbara were 20 when their father was sworn in, making them quite a bit older than the Obama girls, they undoubtedly shared some of the same experiences

Jenna and her sister Barbara were 20 when their father was sworn in as President, making them quite a bit older than the Obama girls.

'When you're on your death bed, that's the stuff you're going to remember - you holding hands with your daughter'

Still, they undoubtedly shared some of the same experiences growing up with such a prominent father.

And in an Instagram post shared yesterday, Jenna wrote that her dad and President Obama have more in common than just the White House.

'One thing I learned from my dear dad is that family is more important than politics,' she said. 'Tune into @todayshow to hear Pres Obama talk about his most important role: fatherhood.'
