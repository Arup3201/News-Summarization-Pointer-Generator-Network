A man accused of becoming an Al Qaeda operative discussed bombing New York City movie theaters, Grand Central Terminal, Times Square and the New York Stock Exchange before settling on the city's subways, a court has heard.

Adis Madunjanin allegedly plotted against the high-profile targets with two of his former high school classmates from Queens.

The men ‘were prepared to kill themselves and everyone else around them — men, women and children,’ said Assistant U.S. Attorney James Looman in opening statements on Monday.

The extraordinary case has seen attempted shoe bomber Saajid Muhammad Badat released from prison early in exchanging for testifying against his alleged fellow jihadist.

Defence attorney Robert Gottlieb 
accused the government of using ‘inflammatory rhetoric’ about al Qaeda 
and terrorism to prevent jurors ‘from seeing the truth about this case.’

‘The truth is that Adis Medunjanin is not a terrorist,’ he countered.

There's no dispute that Medunjanin and his two former classmates travelled together to Pakistan in 2008.

But federal prosecutors say the three 
were homegrown Muslim extremists who, under al Qaeda's tutelage, came 
back to the United States and hatched a foiled plot to attack the New 
York City subways as suicide bombers.

Medunjanin, 27, has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, and providing material support to a terrorist organization among other charges in what U.S. officials have described as one of the most chilling terror conspiracies since the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Childhood friends Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay have admitted in guilty pleas that they wanted to avenge U.S. aggression in the Arab world by becoming martyrs. Both have been called by the government to testify against Medunjanin.

'Adis agreed to be one of the suicide bombers,' said Ahmedzay, who was called as the first prosecution witness.

Medunjanin had 'no hesitation' and 'was committed' to the plan, Ahmedzay said.

'I remember him saying he would mention he was doing the suicide mission of his own choice,' the witness added. 'And that he loved death more than he loved life.'

But Medunjanin backed out of the plot, Gottlieb countered in opening arguments.

He was a 'serious, studious and sincere' young man who balked at joining his friends in the 'martyrdom operations,' Gottlieb said.

'Adis Medunjanin made his decision, and he decided not to be a terrorist, not to be a suicide bomber.'

Another possible witness is Bryant Neal Vinas, a Long Island man who joined al Qaeda around the same time as the other men.

Officials have credited Vinas with providing key intelligence about the terror group since his capture in 2008.

They are also expecting to get valuable information from Saajid Muhammad Badat who is due to testify against Medunjanin.

Badat, who was jailed in Britain in 
2005 for his role in a 2001 plot to down an American Airlines flight 
from Paris to Miami with explosives hidden inside shoes, has had his 
jail term cut from 13 years to 11 years in a ground-breaking deal.

In an extraordinary secret court 
hearing, the Islamic fundamentalist was released following a private 
discussion between a judge, his solicitor and prosecutors.

That bargain means he has already been released, rather than having to wait until 2013 to request parole.

The details of his release were not 
made public until this week, when they were revealed as part of the 
announcement that he would be testifying in Medunjanin's case.

'This
trial is the first time a UK convicted terrorist has agreed, under the 
terms of our agreement, to give evidence in the United States,’ said Sue
Hemming from the British Crown Prosecution Service.

'Badat has helped with investigations 
in this country, he continues to co-operate and has agreed to testify in
other trials if called upon.’

Badat was an accomplice of so-called shoe bomber Richard Reid, who is serving a life sentence in the United States.

'We considered very carefully the 
merits of entering into this agreement with a convicted terrorist, and 
we believe that the administration of justice internationally benefits 
from such an agreement,’ Ms Hemming said.

Jurors
also are expected to hear evidence that following his arrest, 
Medunjanin told the FBI he had become a more devout Muslim about four 
years before the plot was exposed after he and childhood friend Zazi 
began spending time together at a local mosque, FBI reports say.

He also recalled being influenced by tapes of U.S.-born extremist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, they say.

In
2008, Medunjanin and his friends decided to join the Taliban and fight 
U.S. soldiers in retaliation for the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal, 
the FBI reports say.

The three instead were recruited by al Qaeda operatives, who gave them weapons training in their Pakistan camp and asked them to become suicide bombers, they say.

Medunjanin told his al Qaeda handlers ‘he had prayed but still wasn't sure if he was ready to be a martyr,’ the reports say.

He was later sent home on his own, the reports add, after he told them ‘the best thing for him to do ... was to return to the U.S. and provide financial support’ for the terror network.

Medunjanin was arrested in early 2010 after attempting to crash his car into another vehicle in what prosecutors have described as a failed suicide attempt.

Prosecutors have presented recordings of 911 emergency calls in which they say Medunjanin identified himself, made jihadist statements, and declared 'We love death' immediately before the crash. At the time he was under surveillance by federal agents.

Gottlieb said the statements were an expression of desperation from a man whose home had just been raided by federal agents and who was overwhelmed with the possibility of being branded a Muslim terrorist.

Zazi, after relocating to the Denver area, got as far as cooking up explosives and setting out by car for New York City in September 2009 to carry out the attack. He was arrested after abandoning the plan and fleeing back to Colorado.

The FBI reports say Medunjanin denied knowing what Zazi was up to. And the defence has claimed he spoke to the FBI under duress.

In a sworn statement, the defendant accused agents of making veiled threats against his family and denying him access to his attorney for 36 hours. Federal authorities insist his statements were voluntary.
