A half-century-old section of a U.S. Air Force base in Texas has been transformed into a holding and processing center for thousands of children illegally crossing the border from Central and South America without adults.

Leaked photos from the base, which were obtained by the Breitbart.com news blog show hundreds of children holed up in crowded concrete rooms, many of them sleeping on the bare floor without blankets or pillows.

Among those children are Jose Maquez Soto, 12, who came from Honduras to the United States and now rests on a bunk at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio under a hand-drawn flag of his native country and a message cheering the Honduran squad in the upcoming soccer World Cup.

Overflowing: The shelter at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to Nogales for processing

Hundreds of immigrants believed to be in the country illegally from Central America and Mexico being held in crowded concrete rooms similar to a jail cell

Many of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger

Lackland has become a temporary shelter for youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone

America has been left astounded by the shocking conditions these children have been kept in - conditions so dire that border control agents fear the spread of disease

About 850 that were being housed at the facility have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor

Jose is one of the 60,000 'unaccompanied minors' - children under 18 - that the Obama administration estimates will enter the United States illegally this year.

It projects that number to grow to nearly 130,000 next year, creating what the White House describes as an 'urgent humanitarian situation'.

Nearly 1,000 of the minors at a time are being sheltered at a facility built about 50 years ago to house new recruits for basic training.

The boys and girls will pass along corridors with faded Air Force pictures and new signs written in Spanish that point the way to the dining hall and bathrooms.

Since the facility opened three weeks ago, 1,820 children have passed through the center.

About 850 have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor, said U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Jesus Garcia.

President Barack Obama said the sharp influx of unaccompanied children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala was an 'urgent humanitarian situation'

More than 33,000 minors were apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas since October last year, it has been reported

At the base, children are provided with three hot meals and two snacks a day. They can call home twice a week. They have access to mental health clinicians and on-site medical care

The minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala

The person who takes the child, Garcia says, has to agree to bring the child to an immigration hearing.

The minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

They are sometimes seeking to reunite with a parent who is already in the United States, also without documentation.

Another facility for minors will open at Naval Base Ventura County in Southern California that will hold a maximum of 600 children.

At Lackland, the children between the ages of 12 and 17 are handed several sheets and towels when they arrive and checked for lice and scabies.

Republicans blame President Obama for the situation, pointing to his 2012 policy that sent a message of hope to kids yearning to stay in the U.S.

Photos leaked Thursday from a U.S. Border Patrol facility in the Rio Grande Valley show overflowing holding facilities of immigrants, many of whom are children

Over 400 children a day are coming and as many as 60,000 will cross the Mexican border illegally this year

They then undergo physical and mental health evaluations, and are assigned a metal bunk from among the rows that line the walls of large barracks-style rooms.   

There is little need for storage because, as social workers put it, few of these children arrived with anything other than the clothes they wore on their journey north.

The administration estimates it costs taxpayers $252 per child per day.

'The reasons, as we understand them, that contribute to this dramatic increase have to do with economic conditions in those countries, sustained violence in these countries, and the desire of these children to be reunited with family members in the United States,' Celia Munoz, the White House Domestic Policy Adviser said.
