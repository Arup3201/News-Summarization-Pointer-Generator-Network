Boxer Vido Loncar launched an astonishing physical attack on the referee after losing his fight at the European Youth Boxing Championships in Croatia.

Loncar and opponent Algirdas Baniulis were trading punches when the referee broke them up and initiated a standing count against Loncar, before calling off the fight.  

As both boxers waited for the judge to announce Baniulis as the victor, light-heavyweight Loncar viciously attacked the referee with a barrage of punches, continuing even when the official hit the canvas.

Lithuanian Baniulis, who was awarded the victory, quickly fled the scene as spectators seemed stunned by the despicable attack.

Loncar’s coach failed to intervene as the attack ensued, before the Croatian was dragged from the ring by his feet by security guards.

Fortunately the referee was then helped to his feet and received medical attention as Loncar was led away in shame. 

Lithuanian contender Algirdas Baniulis was winning the fight with consummate ease before it was stopped
