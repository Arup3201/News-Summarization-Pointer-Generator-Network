Emotional eating is a big problem for many people.

Seventy per cent turn to comfort food, to varying extents, for emotional reasons. And over 90 per cent of diets fail due to slipping back into emotional eating habits.

You might recognise yourself from this list of key behaviours and feelings emotional eaters frequently report:

Dr Pam says that celebrations such as Christmas can see children encouraged to overeat

Children are often taught from a young age that food is a way of making you feel better when you're upset

If these, or similar, thoughts and behaviours mean you head to snacks or extra helpings to ease emotional upset or stress - then emotional eating is something you should tackle.

You probably know it's a cycle that comes back to bite you because that faux-relief from eating evaporates quickly and you frequently feel worse because of guilt.

Where does my emotional eating come from?

The question for most emotional eaters is why do I do it, why can't I stop myself heading for comfort food? Often followed by self-defeating thoughts like I always slip up, I'm useless at controlling my emotional eating.

This pattern of behaviour often has roots in childhood. Emotional eaters should never underestimate the power of how their parents treated food and how that influences them for life until they decide to change.

Of course some people have a seemingly healthy relationship with food in their early life only to find after a trauma like divorce or job loss they seek extra comfort in food. But even for them there may be a heritage of resorting to emotional eating in their family.

Think about these scenarios: As a child when you, e.g., fell off your bicycle your mother would say 'come on, you'll feel better after a treat.'

When older and you came home from school upset over something, again you were given an 'extra special' snack to cheer you up. When your mother or father was upset you also saw them have an extra piece of cake or bag of crisps, etc.

This behaviour of using food to soothe emotions is extremely common in families. It's nothing to do with being 'bad parents' it's simply unrecognised as establishing in childhood a relationship with food that turns it into comfort.

Dr Pam Spurr says that the first step towards conquering emotional eating is becoming aware of what is triggering it

Even in times of celebration some families allow their children to gorge on as many helpings as they want. Not only at classic times of feasting like Christmas, or other religious holidays, but when someone does well at exams, passes their driving test, etc. Occasional feasting is fine but to take it to extremes isn't.  

So whether food was used in your family as comfort, as a reward, or both, this becomes the unconscious way you relate to food. It's imbedded in your mind, emotions and behaviour.

Become actively aware of your emotional eating

If this resonates with your experience and you can see you might have had a lifelong relationship to food like this, take a one-day-at-a-time approach to changing it.

Try learning to focus on the moment rather than always reflecting on the past or thinking ahead to the future. When you start to make it a habit of becoming mindful of the present it helps diminish your stress levels and helps you take control of the here-and-now.

Don't allow yourself to go on 'autopilot' at meal times or when having a healthy snack. Think about what you're putting in your mouth, chew it slowly, and appreciate the moment. When you don't think during a meal you're more likely to eat quickly and overload yourself.

Dr Pam's book, The Emotional Eater's Diet is available to buy now

Plan what you can do today in response to daily stresses instead of emotional eating. Only think about today and what change you can make. Then go ahead and try it.

Don't sweep difficult feelings under the emotional carpet. If someone/something upsets you think how you can respond to it. Don't reach into your drawer at work or cupboard at home for biscuits.

Dump unhealthy snacks from your workplace and home. Instead when you need to fuel your energy needs (not your emotional needs) have a banana, small portion of unsalted/fried nuts, veggie sticks with low-fat yoghurt dip, etc.

Know your danger zones - if you head to the staff cafe every time you're upset by your manager plan a different strategy. Message your partner, ring your best friend, plan how to tackle their behaviour, or go for a brisk walk.

Wherever possible bring your own food to work in pre-measured portion sizes. That way you're in control of how healthy your food choices are. While working at not, e.g., heading off to the newsagents to buy sweets when upset, only bring the cash you need to work.

Beware of shopping temptations, particularly after a stressful day at work. Take your shopping list and stick to it, never shop when hungry, avoid the aisles with your favourite comfort foods, and check your basket at the till to make sure you haven't unconsciously thrown in some unhealthy snacks.

Your emotional eating might have originated within your family but that doesn't mean you can't start understanding and managing it from today.
