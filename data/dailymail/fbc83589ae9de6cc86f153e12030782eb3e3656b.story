David Cameron today admitted having an intense conversation with Rebekah Brooks at a Christmas party, but insisted it was ‘not a big deal’.

The Prime Minister and the ex-News of the World editor were said have had a lengthy chat last month at a festive party near his Oxfordshire home, despite the government wrestling with how to regulate the press. 

Mr Cameron has repeatedly been criticised for his close relationship with Mrs Brooks, who resigned as chief executive of News International at the height of the phone-hacking scandal.

David Cameron was forced to defend chatting with Rebekah Brooks at a party last month, as the government draws up plans to regualte the press. The old friends are pictured at a different party in 2009

Mrs Brooks faces three sets of charges linked to her time at Rupert Murdoch’s media empire

She has been accused of conspiring with her husband, Charlie, and others to pervert the course of justice.

She
is also facing charges of conspiring to intercept the voicemails of 
individuals and conspiring to commit misconduct in public office. She 
denies the charges.

Two 
weeks emerged that Mr Cameron had met his old friend at a pre-Christmas 
party organised by Tom Astor, great-grandson of the American heiress 
Nancy Astor.

The bash was held in Chipping Norton in Mr Cameron’s constituency on December 15.

According to The Guardian the pair had a 'lengthy conversation' which was described as 'intense' by an eyewitness.

At the time Labour MP Tom Watson said it was 'just like old times'.

Mr Cameron was left embarrassed last year after it emerged he signed off texts to Mrs Brooks with 'LOL' thinking it stood for 'lots of love'

But today the PM played down the significance of his festive conversation with Mrs Brooks.

Challenged about the reports on BBC Radio 5Live, Mr Cameron said: 'My wife's cousin had a party and I went and it is not a big deal, what really matters is the country and the decisions that are taken.'

Mr Cameron's relationship with Mrs Brooks was thrown into sharp relief when it emerged during the Leveson Inquiry that he had regularly sent her texts signed off with 'LOL' believing it stood for 'lots of love'.

The PM was also forced to admit he had ridden a former police horse with Mr Brooks, which had been lent to Mrs Brooks by Scotland Yard.

Reports of the conversation with Mrs Brooks raised questions about the PM's judgement at a time when he is grappling with how to regulate the press.

Senior politicians are due to hold further cross-party talks on setting up a new system of newspaper regulation next week.

But Mr Cameron swept the criticism away, insisting he was 'very focused on the job I do'.

He added: 'It is a hugely fulfilling job and an enormous opportunity and a great honour to have this job but it is a difficult time for Britain and I try and do this job in a way that I am levelling with people about the difficulties we face and not pretending it is easy when it isn't.

‘We do face difficult years, people have seen that when their wage packets haven't been going up, the challenges in terms of cost of living. I think there are important problems and challenges for this country to get on and get over, I think this government is helping them to do that.’
