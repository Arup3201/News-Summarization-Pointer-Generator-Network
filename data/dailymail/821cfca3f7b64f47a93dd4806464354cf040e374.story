This is the world's oldest surviving McDonald's restaurant - which still retains a classic 1950s feel, as well as the fast food chain's original mascot 'Speedee'.

Built in 1953, the restaurant in Downey, California still has its original red-striped exterior, giving it an appearance quite different from the other 30,000 McDonald's restaurants around the world.

The unique, time-capsule appearance of the restaurant is completed by the 1950s-style uniforms the staff wear, and the original recipe hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and milkshakes.

Retro: The McDonald's restaurant in Downey, California still has its original red-striped exterior, giving it an appearance quite different from the other 30,000 branches around the world

Character: A key part of the nostalgic feel of the restaurant is the presence of the original McDonald's mascot - Speedee the chef - suspended 60ft above the car park

Time-capsule: Staff at the restaurant wear 1950s-style uniforms - including paper hats - while serving original recipe hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and milkshakes

Key to the nostalgic nature of the restaurant is the presence of the original McDonald's mascot - Speedee the chef - suspended 60ft above the car park.

While serving original 1950s cuisine - which customers order from a retro-designed menu - staff at the outlet wear the fast food chain's historic uniforms, including paper hats.

As 
well as old-fashioned food, the restaurant also serves current 
favourites such as Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets - but only because it 
nearly closed in the 1990s due to declining sales.

McDonald's
 had planned to demolish it and build a 'retro' one nearby but instead 
restored the current architecture following pressure from 
preservationists.

The restaurant has been located in Downey - 12 miles from Los Angeles - for the past 61 years.

Despite its history, many locals had no idea the restaurant was the oldest of its kind in existence.

Customer Christians Gerhard, 40, from Las Vegas, Nevada, made a 560-mile round trip to Downey just to eat at the restaurant.

Traditional: The mascot 'Speedee' was based on a chef who embodied the fast service diners could expect and he still features on the Downey restaurant's drinks

Different times: Speedee looks over the building's so-called 'Googie' architecture - a popular movement between the 1940s and mid-1960s inspired by the USA's growing obsession with cars and space travel

Unique: Even the two 'golden arches' either side of the restaurant's front service window are also a relic because they are of a kind only installed at the world's first three McDonald's

'It's my favourite McDonald's by far. That's why I made the effort to come here,' he said.

'There's
 something special about it, the architecture and the feel. It's more 
like a 1950s burger shack than a modern fast food place,' she added.

Her husband, Kirby, 45 agreed, adding: 'You can almost imagine waitresses on roller skates bringing the meals.'

'I love McDonald's but most of them you visit could be anywhere... This
 is so distinctive, from the look of it, and you'd never believe it was a
 McDonald's if it wasn't for the Golden Arches,' he said.

When built, the restaurant was only the third ever McDonald's to open and operated outside of the main franchise for decades.

The first ever McDonald's opened in San Bernardino, California in 1938, selling hamburgers for just ten cents each.

But
 as it was run independently from the main company, the site in Downey 
kept its distinctive 1950s feel, while other McDonald's restaurants 
worldwide were given a more uniform look.

Record: The restaurant has been located in Downey - 12 miles from Los Angeles - for the past 61 years. Despite its history, many locals had no idea the restaurant was the oldest of its kind in existence

Branching out: As well as old-fashioned food, the restaurant also serves current favourites such as Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets - but only because it nearly closed in the 1990s due to declining sales

Rescue: McDonald's had planned to demolish the restaurant and build a brand new branch with a 'retro' design nearby. Instead they opted to restore the current architecture following pressure from preservationists

The mascot 'Speedee' was based on a chef who embodied the fast service diners could expect and he still features on the Downey restaurant's drinks.

The fast food chain replaced the character with the now far better known Ronald McDonald in 1967.

Speedee looks over the building's so-called 'Googie' architecture - a popular movement between the 1940s and mid-1960s that was inspired by the USA's growing obsession with cars and space travel.

Even the two 'golden arches' either side of the restaurant's front service window are also a relic because they are of a kind only installed at the world's first three McDonald's.

Visitors come from all over the world purely to experience the unique McDonald's restaurant.

Among them is Simon Gray, a 38-year-old building developer from Nottingham.

'I love McDonald's and I'd read about this location on the internet and just had to visit - it was a sort of pilgrimage for me,' he said.

'I've eaten at McDonald's all over the world but this one is so unique... I don't know whether it's the retro style but the food tastes even better than it normally does,' he added. 

Brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald opened the first McDonald's restaurant in San Bernardino, California in 1940.

Eight years after it was set up, the company introduced a 'Speedee Service System', which helped kick-start the fast food craze by pre-cooking food ahead of a customer order.

To help sell the idea, McDonald's created the mascot 'Speedee' - designed as a chef to reassure customers of the food's quality.

Ronald McDonald (centre) replaced Speedee as the company's official mascot in 1967. He inhabits a fantasy world of characters, including the monster Grimace (top left) and The Hamburgler (bottom left)

The first restaurants were run as franchises, allowing each to operate independently while benefiting from being part of a bigger brand.

It wasn't until 1955 that Czech-American businessman Ray Kroc opened the ninth McDonald's restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois.

The success of his business encouraged Kroc to partner with the McDonald brothers and relaunch the business as a global chain.

Aggressive expansion followed, with the McDonald brothers regularly arguing with Kroc over how the business should be run.

By 1961 the brothers finally grew tired of Kroc's global ambitions for the company, selling their shares to him for $2.7million and retiring from the fast food business altogether.

In 1967 Speedee was replaced as company mascot by Ronald McDonald - a clown who inhabits the 'McDonaldland' fantasy world.

The origin of Ronald McDonald is disputed, with actor Willard Scott claiming McDonald's adopted a character he had invented, while the company insists Scott merely played the role in early television appearances.
