Saturday Night Live has dropped Weekend Update anchor Cecily Strong and replaced her with a correspondent from Jon Stewart's The Daily Show.

Comedian Michael Che will handle Weekend Update duties with Colin Jost during the upcoming 40th season of SNL, NBC said on Thursday.

Che, who wrote for SNL last season, had joined Stewart's Comedy Central show earlier this year.

Michael Che, shown earlier this month at the Toronto Film Festival, will join Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update desk as the anchor later this month

In an 
August episode focused on the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, 
Missouri, Che appeared as a reporter trying to find a safe place in 
America for a black man.

Cecily Strong will stay with SNL as a cast member, NBC said while Che will handle desk duties on the faux news skit.

Saturday Night Live returns for its 40th season premiere on September 27, with host Chris Pratt and musical guest Ariana Grande.

Strong will remain on SNL as a regular cast member while Che will join returning anchor Colin Jost, 32, in the regular segment.

The show's creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels said he tried 'a number of different combinations' in the past few weeks before selecting Che.

He will join Jost who started co-anchoring Weekend Update in the middle of last season after Seth Meyers left for his own late-night NBC chat show.Â

Jost, who is one of the show's two head writers, and Che, who has a background in stand-up comedy in New York, formed a close relationship last year, Michaels said.

'This is about a new era, what feels appropriate for now. That's why we did a lot of combinations and tests, and this is kind of where we came out,' Michaels told The Times.

He also expressed his confidence in Strong as one of the show's top performers and said the move would allow her to appear more frequently in sketches this season.

Che recently appeared on The Daily Show 
on August 26 when he starred in a segment with Jon Stewart about finding
 a safe location to report on the shooting of a black teenager.

Jost joined the SNL writing staff in 2005 and he also wrote and appears in the comedy Staten Island Summer starring Twilight star Ashley Greene.

The Weekend Update anchor desk previosly has featured Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Dennis Miller, Norm Macdonald, Jimmy Fallon and Colin Quinn.

The segment was created by Chevy Chase and SNL writer Herb Sargent and appeared on the first SNL show in October 1975.

Jane
 Curtin also previously anchored the segment along with Dan Aykroyd and 
Bill Murray and Weekend Update in the 1970s featured editorials by John 
Belushi.

Saturday Night Live
 will return on September 27 with Guardians Of The Galaxy star Chris 
Pratt hosting and Ariana Grande as the musical guest.
