Victor Valdes has hailed David de Gea as the 'best goalkeeper in the world' after signing for Manchester United.

United announced on Thursday evening that Valdes has agreed an 18-month contract with the option to extend for a further year.

Manager Louis van Gaal says that he will be the No 2 goalkeeper behind De Gea, whose contract at the club expires in the summer of 2016. It is expected that Valdes, a three-time Champions League winner with Barcelona, will provide serious competition to his Spanish counterpart.

'I think now, at the moment, he is the best goalkeeper in the world,' Valdes told MUTV, 'His performance every day and in every game shows everybody that his level is very high. He has had a great year and it is very nice. Now I think he is the best goalkeeper in the world.'

On the anticipated rivalry, Valdes said: 'I am here to help everybody. Always in my career, I have played to help my team-mates, to help my coach and to help everybody. I am a part of the team and I am not a problem, I am just a part of the team.'

Valdes spent 14 trophy-laden seasons in the Barcelona first team before departing last summer. Since then, he has been recovering from a serious knee injury and continued his rehabilitation by training with United.

United boss Van Gaal said: 'I am delighted Victor has signed for the club. I have said on many occasions that Manchester United will always be interested in the best players. He joins the club as the No 2 goalkeeper and is a great addition to the first team.'

Van Gaal handed Valdes his debut for Barcelona in 2002 and the goalkeeper has thanked his mentor and new manager for 'saving' his career.

'It has been a hard recovery time from my injury and the first thing I want to say is thank you to Louis van Gaal for letting me work again with him and his team. 

'This change is very important for me because my injury was very, very hard. United and everybody around United saved me and they looked after me, so I am very grateful for everybody around the world and for the manager for giving me the chance to be a United player.

'The first day when I came here to the Aon Training Complex, I saw the big red letters of Manchester United. For me, it is like a dream. This is the same feeling as Barca. For me it is very nice and it is a pleasure to be a part of this family of Manchester United.'
