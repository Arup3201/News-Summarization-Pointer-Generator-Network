Harry and Amelia were the most popular babies’ names in England last year.

They pushed the previous year’s favourites – Oliver and Olivia – into second place on the lists for boys and girls.

The popularity of Harry appears to have been fuelled by the success of One Direction singer Harry Styles, the continuing influence of Harry Potter and the prominence of Prince Harry.

for the surge in popularity of Harry while Amelia and Lily are very popular girls' names -  X Factor finalist Amelia Lily, right, has both in hers

Harry – the name given to one baby boy
in 50 – would be even further ahead if it were counted with its more 
formal version, Henry.

While there were 7,523 Harrys, 2,625 babies were called Henry, the 28th most popular boys’ name.

For girls, the rise of Amelia – the 
name given to 5,054 babies – may have been driven by pop singer and X 
Factor finalist Amelia Lily, with Lily climbing a place to become the 
third most popular name.

Teen fantasy fiction also appears to 
have had an influence. Jacob rose five places to become the seventh most
popular name for boys – given to more than 5,000 – while Bella entered 
the top 100 for girls in 69th place. Both are names of characters in the
Twilight book and film series.

The Office for National Statistics, 
which released the figures, said: ‘The popularity of names can be 
influenced by names of famous figures or current celebrities and what 
they name their own babies.

‘However, it is an individual choice 
which can be influenced by a number of other factors such as the 
religious, cultural or ethnic identities of the parents or the names of 
family, friends or fictional characters.’

Inspiration? Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan, Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen and Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black. The names Bella and Jacob soared in popularity last year possibly as a result of the hit film franchise

Muslim parents commonly name baby boys
after the Islamic prophet, which put Mohammed at 19th in the rankings 
last year, given to 3,054 babies. A further 3,891 boys were named by two
other versions, Muhammad and Mohammad.

Blake, Frankie, Elijah and Jackson 
were new entries in the top 100 for boys, while Aidan, Bradley, Sam, 
Brandon and Kieran all fell out.

For girls, Ava and Isabella were promoted by parents to the top ten, in place of Evie and Chloe.

And new to the top 100 alongside Bella were Willow, Elsie, Kayla, Francesca and Lydia.

There was no appearance for Catherine 
or Kate – perhaps surprising given the popularity of the Duchess of 
Cambridge – although Katie, while down, still ranked at 57.

In Wales, Oliver remained the most popular boys’ name, while Riley, Ethan and Dylan were all in the top ten there.
