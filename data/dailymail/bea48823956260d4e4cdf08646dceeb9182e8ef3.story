Troy Holliday, from Blackburn, was found unresponsive in his parents' double bed after all three slept there together, an inquest heard

A healthy baby boy may have been accidentally smothered as he and his parents all slept together in a double bed, an inquest was told.

Troy Holliday, who was seven weeks old, had been taken from his moses basket into his parents' bed for an early morning feed less than two hours before he was found lying, unresponsive, next to his mother.

The baby, who was discovered by his father as he got up for work, wasn't breathing, and had blood trickling from his nose, and was declared dead by doctors soon after when efforts to resuscitate him failed, the hearing in Blackburn, Lancashire, was told.

Troy, a thriving baby boy from Blackburn, had been put to bed the night before in his moses basket next to his parents' bed, and woke at 1am for a feed and again at 4.20am.

A police statement read to the court said the baby's mother, Holly Bell, 29, woke her partner up to prepare the feed at 4.20am before feeding her small son herself. 

Troy's father last saw Miss Bell holding Troy as he went back to sleep, before his alarm woke him up at 6am. 

Mr Holliday had been sleeping on the far side of the bed next to a wardrobe, Miss Bell was in the middle, and the baby on the side of the bed between his mother and his moses basket, the coroner was told. 

The baby's father noticed his son lying unresponsive on his back, with his feet under the duvet, beside his mother.  Troy wasn't breathing and had blood trickling from his nose. 

Mr Holliday dialled 999 and began to administer CPR, but the baby was pronounced dead at Blackburn hospital at 6.49am that day.

Miss Bell's aunt, Margaret Garth, 55, who also lived at the house, told the inquest Troy was a healthy baby.

'Troy was a thriving baby who woke up at regular times like clockwork,' she said.

'He was doing really well, no illness, no coughs, no nothing - he was coming on well.  There were no illnesses.'

She said she had made her home smoke-free before the baby was born, and insisted on Troy's parents, both of whom smoked, doing so outdoors.

And Mrs Garth said the room was kept to an optimal temperature which the baby's father was 'meticulous' about checking, which ruled out the possibility of the baby overheating. 

Police said they had spoken to the baby's parents about the incident but had not taken any action against them.

Paediatric pathologist Melanie Newbold told the inquest that tests had found nothing wrong with Troy, and said that in the past, the baby's death would have been attributed to 'cot death'.

She said the term 'unascertained death' was used more now, but said certain factors including sleeping not in a cot and sleeping with a parent were known to be linked to a higher incidence of such deaths. 

Recording an open verdict, coroner Michael Singleton said that the infant may have been a victim of 'accidental overlaying', where the child is smothered by a larger individual sleeping on top of them. 

He told the family that because an adult turns in the night, one could obstruct a baby's airways and the baby would not have the ability to push back.

Mr Singleton said: 'I recognise that one possibility is that of accidentally overlaying. I cannot eliminate that as a possibility, but certainly no evidence that would confirm that.

'Whilst it might be a natural cause of death, nothing can confirm that, and in these circumstances it therefore leaves me with no alternative than to reach an open verdict.'

The coroner added: 'I know you wanted an explanation; that I have been unable to give you.

'There is nothing I can say that will go close to reflecting the tragedy of this situation other than you have my heartfelt condolences.'
