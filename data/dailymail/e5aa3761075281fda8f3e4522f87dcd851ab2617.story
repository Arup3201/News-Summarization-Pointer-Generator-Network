Harry Redknapp is refusing to lift the lid on the England 'refuseniks' after Three Lions captain Steven Gerrard ordered the QPR boss to name and shame the players who he claimed have feigned injury to avoid international duty.

Redknapp had told Radio 5 Live at the weekend that when he was Tottenham boss some players had asked him to pull them out of England squads.

The claim, however, riled Gerrard after he admitted he was 'broken' by England's failure to get out of the group stages.

‘I tell you what, I’d be interested to find out who those players are,' said Gerrard.

‘If Harry is making a comment like that, he should name them and embarrass them. No one in this group wants to go home. No one wants to go home.

‘If he’s not naming them, I can’t answer that. If it’s the case, it’s disgusting. For me, if a player doesn’t want to be, he doesn’t deserve to be here at a World Cup. The comment is a comment, like ‘them’.

‘They’ didn’t want to play for England. Who? Name them? Is it Aaron Lennon, Kyle Walker, Andros Townsend?

‘I don’t know who he means. Five years ago? 10 years ago? I’ve spoken to Jermain Defoe and he’s devastated.

‘I can understand why you’ve asked the question, with Harry Redknapp a big coach in the game, but we need names. We need names. But it’s not here. I can guarantee it’s not here.

‘He should be embarrassed if there’s one player. When you go down into the younger age groups, they’re younger lads.

‘They might not want to be away from their families. But when you’re picked at this level and find any excuse not to be here, you don’t deserve to be here.’

But Redknapp responded to Sportsmail, saying: ‘I understand Steven’s concern but I don’t want to get into naming names because it wouldn’t be fair to the players. Every Premier League manager past and present knows what I’m talking about.

'Probably even Roy Hodgson. But sadly this attitude is not unusual these days. You’ve only got to look at how many players pull out of an international game on Tuesday and Wednesday then are running about for their clubs the next Saturday to see that this is a very real issue.’

Hodgson also claimed it would be a major surprise if there were players involved with his squads who found excuses not to join up with the national team.

England’s head coach added: 'We have to make clear to players: if you want to play for England, you commit yourself for England.

‘In the two years I’ve been here, I’ve seen a greater interest in playing for England, so Harry’s comments come as a bit of a surprise.

‘If you make comments like that, you have to name them. I could name a player with an educated guess but players? It’s unfair to ask people to look back historically. Let’s see how it will be moving forward. Let’s keep our standards high.’

Redknapp's nephew Frank Lampard, meanwhile, will captain England in the final game of the 2014 World Cup as Gerrard drops to the bench against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday.
