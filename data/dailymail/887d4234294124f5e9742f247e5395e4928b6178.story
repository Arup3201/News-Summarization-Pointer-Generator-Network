Dressed in a Santa Claus outfit for a holiday party over the weekend, 24-year-old Eddie Fuentes was the designated driver who made sure everyone got home safely –- everyone except for himself.

Last Saturday, Fuentes was standing next to his favorite hot dog joint, Original Maxwell Street in Chicago's Gage Park neighborhood, just after 3am when he was struck and killed by a suspected drunken driver.

Jason Rayford, 30, has been charged with reckless homicide and domestic battery in connection to the deadly crash in the 5300 block of South Western Avenue.

The crash happened outside Fuentes' favorite hot dog joint, Original Maxwell Street on South Western Avenue 

Detectives say Rayford was punching his wife in the face during a dispute as she drove her 2006 Chevy Impala, reported NBC Chicago. 

At one point, police say the 30-year-old grabbed the steering wheel and that is when the car careened into Fuentes who was standing next to his car parked outside the hot dog stand at the time.

The 24-year-old man was rushed to Advocate Christ Medical Center suffering from a severe brain injury. He passed away five hours later, still wearing his Santa suit.

Jason Rayford attempted to flee on foot after the crash but was caught a short time later.

Three witnesses identified Rayford from a police line-up. His 29-year-old wife has been charged with a DUI.

According to his arrest report, Rayford, an employee at a chemical transportation company, is a suspected member of a Chicago street gang.

On Tuesday, the 30-year-old appeared in court for his arraignment. A judge gave him the option of being released on electronic monitoring, if he qualifies for the program, or on $100,000 bail.

Rayford also has been prohibited from getting behind the wheel, if he is released from jail.

Eddie Fuentes' family were struggling this week to accept the loss of the bright, kind-hearted and gregarious graphic design student who was the glue that kept his family together.

The youngest of four siblings, Eddie was described as a gifted guitar player who was a year away from graduation, according to his older brother Fernando.

Mr Fuentes, 28, recalled how the last time he saw his beloved kid brother alive, which was a day before the crash, he had just returned home from his job in tech support for RedBox and hugged him from behind.

‘He was too young to go,’ Fernando said. ‘He always made sure his friends got home safe. It hurts that no one made sure that he got home safe.’

Eddie's mother, Laticia Monarrez, tearfully recalled to ABC 7 Chicago how on Saturday night before the fateful party she told him, 'Be careful, Eddie.'

The 24-year-old kissed her and replied, 'I will, I love you.' Those were Eddie’s last words to his mother.

Everyone in the Fuentes family have their favorite ‘Eddie’ memory: how he liked to joke around with his father about his height and made popcorn for him after work; how he spent hours watching The Real Housewives of Atlanta with his mother, and how on the day of his sister’s wedding in September Eddie helped the bride paint her nails.

Above all, Eddie will be remembered for being caring and compassionate towards those he loved.

‘He always made sure his friends got home safe. It hurts that no one made sure that he got home safe,’ his brother Fernando lamented in an interview with Chicago Tribune. 

Eddie’s big sister Patty Landeros has launched a GoFundMe campaign to help the family bring justice for their beloved son and brother.
