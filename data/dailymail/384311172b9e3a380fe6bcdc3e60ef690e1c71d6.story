Hurricane Beatriz hit holiday resorts on Mexico's Pacific coast today with heavy rainfall and 90mph winds forcing tourists to take shelter in their hotels.

Beatriz had been expected to move out to sea, but switched direction overnight, developing from a tropical storm into a full blown hurricane as it headed back towards land.

The U.S. State Department issued a message urging its citizens to find shelter, monitor media reports and follow official instructions.

The ports of Acapulco, Manzanillo and

to go to the beach. 

One tourist has been injured when a tree fell on him in Acapulco.

About 150 Mexican soldiers were deployed on a rescue mission in case homes needed to be evacuated in Acapulco, the Mexican army said late Monday.

Carmen Lopez, a 40-year-old Mexican tourist holidaying in Manzanillo with about 15 family members said: 'There's a lot of wind.

'I'm kind of scared ... but we're staying here in the hotel for our vacation.'

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Beatriz's winds grew to a hurricane-force 90 mph this morning as the storm moved towards the coast.

In Manzanillo, many tourists ignored warnings and were hanging out at the beach.

The Esquivias family of Concord, California, who arrived Monday for their vacation, said they weren't worried about an impending hurricane at all.

Sandra Esquivias, 15, said: 'A lot of people are saying it isn't true.'

The Mexican government issued a red alert for areas around the resort city of Manzanillo and further warnings were issued from the resort city of Zihuatanejo northwest to Cabo Corrientes.

Beatriz was located about 15 miles south of Manzanillo early Tuesday and was moving north-northwest at 12 mph. was forecast to move away from the coast by late Tuesday.

The hurricane was expected to drop 6 to 12 inches of rain along the coast of southwestern Mexico, possibly causing dangerous flash floods and mud slides.

Some coastal flooding and large waves were expected in the hurricane warning area.

A light rain was falling in Manzanillo late Monday, but people were mostly going about their business with normal vehicle traffic in main avenues.

The eye of the storm was expected to pass within 37 miles of the beach town early Tuesday.

Further south along the coast in Zihuatanejo, civil protection officials ordered the port closed completely and authorized five shelters in case of floods or mudslides.

Some streets and avenues in the tourist district and downtown were flooded Monday night. City officials had to go around picking up fallen trees.

The Tides hotel advised its guests to remain in their rooms if possible and take precautions from rain and wind, receptionist Dulce Miranda said.

Authorities say 100 homes were flooded, 20 trees fell and some avenues in the tourist district were also flooded because of the heavy rains. About 30 parked vehicles were swept by the current.
