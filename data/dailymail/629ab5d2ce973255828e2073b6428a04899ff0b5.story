An abandoned Australian gold mine could help solve one of the great mysteries of the universe.

The Stawell Gold Mine in Victoria is currently undergoing tests by The Centre of Excellence for Particle Physics (CoEPP) to determine if it would be suitable for an underground laboratory.

If it is, the study of the 1,500-metre deep mine would focus entirely on locating and studying dark matter, and the laboratory would be the first of its kind in the southern hemisphere.

The old Stawell Gold Mine could be the site of an underground laboratory for The Centre of Excellence for Particle Physics, which would search for dark matter

A deep underground mine is believed to house the perfect conditions for the identification of dark matter - which, if found, would be a world-first discovery - because the environment filters out other particles and cosmic rays which are present on the Earth's surface.

CoEPP Director, Professor Geoffrey Taylor, said a laboratory in the Stawell Gold Mine could be used by researchers to determine exactly what dark matter consists of. While the existence of dark matter has been hypothesised for years, scientists are yet to identify and study it.

'There is probably four or five times more dark matter in the universe than what there is ordinary matter, which means there is still a huge amount of the universe which we don't know anything about,' he told The Age.

Dark matter is thought to make up almost 95 per cent of the mass of the universe, yet scientists know very little about it

Scientists hope experiments using the Large Hadron Collider - the  world's most powerful particle collider - will help identify and unlock the mysteries of dark matter

Professor Elisabetta Barberio, of the University of Melbourne, said she hoped conditions inside the  abandoned mine shaft would be perfect for spotting dark matter.

'To search for [dark matter] we need to be in an environment that is very quiet and very dark, because if we would put our equipment on the surface of Earth, there would be so many particles coming from the sun, from the atmosphere, from even the galaxy that we call cosmic rays, that would disturb the measurement and we would be swamped by all these particles and we would miss the dark matter particle,' she told the ABC.

Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light.

It
 cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be 
out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we 
can see.

The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates.

'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.'

Scientists are fairly sure it exists, but they do not know what it looks like or 
where to find it.

The benefits of identifying dark matter are yet to be determined, but Professor Barberio is enthusiastic that advantages would soon be found.

'It's like the usual issues with fundamental science; at the beginning there are no applications,' she said.

'But if you look back to a little bit more than 100 years ago when they discovered the first elements of electricity and people didn't know what to do with it, eventually electricity is making most of our lives more comfortable.’

But even if the benefits of the research look as if they won't appear until the very distant future, the experiments, which hope to kick off in the next year or so, are likely to have benefits for the local economy.

'It would be the only facility nationally, Stawell would become a world leader,' Professor Taylor said.

'An underground laboratory with financial support, developed over many years would support technical skills and employment for engineers, electronics technicians, computer technicians etc.'

The Stawell mine, 240kms from Melbourne, has been out of use since 2013 and is believed to house the perfect conditions for identifying dark matter
