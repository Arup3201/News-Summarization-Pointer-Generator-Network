Struck off: Trainee surgeon Suhail Ahmed has been struck off the medical register after he was found to have taken more than 100 intimate photos of women during examinations

A trainee surgeon has been struck off the medical register after he was found to have transformed a hospital ward into his own secret porn studio, a hearing has heard.

Suheil Ahmed, 28, took more than 100 photographs of women while carrying out intimate examinations of women at Torbay Hospital in Devon.

He sectioned off their beds from the rest of the ward, before touching his victims as he removed their clothing to allow himself a better view.

During the intimate examinations Ahmed told his victims, who were all in their 20s, that he was using a mobile phone to time their breathing or heart rate.

He also installed a secret camera in a house owned by his family to film students using the toilet.

Ahmed was suspended by Torbay Hospital after two women complained about their examinations, sparking a probe into his conduct.

A police investigation found 110 images of patients uploaded to his home personal computer along with footage from a secret camera installed in a property belonging to his family.

He initially denied any wrongdoing, claiming he had taken the pictures for his medical portfolio.

But Ahmed, who lived in Cardiff, admitted 11 counts of voyeurism and two counts of sexual assault by touching when he appeared at Exeter Crown Court.

He was jailed for 18 months last October later increased to 30 months after the Court of Appeal found the sentence was ‘unduly lenient’.

The doctor was facing fitness to practise proceedings at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester last Wednesday to Friday where he was branded an ‘on-going risk to patients'.

Neil Usher, for the General Medical Council, told the panel that Dr Ahmed’s crimes constituted a ‘gross breach of trust’ and said the medic remained a ‘danger to the public’.

Ahmed was jailed to 18 months in prison at Exeter Crown Court in October, but his sentenced was lengthened at the Court of Appeal to 30 months after the original sentence was found to be too lenient

The MPTS panel, chaired by Mr Jetinder Shergill, found his actions were so serious that the only appropriate sanction was to impose a lifetime ban from the profession.

‘The panel has concluded that Dr Ahmed’s actions are fundamentally incompatible with him continuing to be a registered medical practitioner,’ Mr Shergill said.

‘The panel was satisfied Dr Ahmed’s actions caused deliberate harm to patients including serious harm to the emotional health of the victims.

‘He abused his position of trust from early on in his career. This abuse occurred when patients were particularly vulnerable due to being in acute pain or in a post-operative recovery state.

‘The sexual nature of the offending in a hospital setting was very serious.

‘The panel has therefore determined that erasure is the most appropriate sanction.’

Dr Ahmed, who is still serving his prison sentence, will be struck off in 28 days, subject to appeal, although the panel imposed an immediate order of suspension.
