After 35 years of plastic surgery, it was quite a pledge to make.

Sharon Osbourne revealed last year that she was finally ready to give up her regular nips and tucks after getting scared about the health risks.

But whether or not she has kept to her promise, the X Factor judge looked far younger than her 61 years in Moscow at the weekend, where she was promoting husband Ozzy’s band Black Sabbath.

Last year, Sharon Osborne said she was no longer considering plastic surgery having first gone under the knife in 1978

She showed off remarkably smooth skin, plumped lips and a firm jawline women half her age would be proud of.

Mrs Osbourne has openly spoken of spending a fortune on cosmetic surgery since her first operation, a breast reduction and lift, in 1978.

She once said: ‘Botox is one of the best things that has ever been created for cosmetic surgery.’

She admitted to having two facelifts, a second breast lift, arm and leg lift, neck lift and tummy tuck after receiving a gastric band.
