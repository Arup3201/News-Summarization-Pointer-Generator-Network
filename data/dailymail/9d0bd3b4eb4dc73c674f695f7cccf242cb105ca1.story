The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog department created in 2011 to create a level financial playing field for American consumers, has scrapped its internal employee performance review process following revelations that nonunion workers and caucasians routinely scored better than unionized employees and minorities in 2013.

The annual performance reviews award scores on a scale from 1 to 5 and are closely tied to salary raises, bonuses and career advancement.

Instead of keeping the scores in place, agency leaders have decided to award all of their 1,100 employees ratings of '5.'

An internal CFPB report released this month found that 'the average ratings for black and Hispanic employees were lower than the average ratings for white and Asian employees.'

Racial disparities? President Obama chose former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray (R) to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2012, but he now presides over a bureaucracy that appears to have un-leveled its internal playing field

The average score for white employees last year was 3.94, while the average was 3.81 for Asians, 3.69 for Hispanics and 3.63 for blacks.

Unionized employees scored an average of 3.79, while their nonunion counterparts scored 4.04.

'Our performance ratings system did not meet our own objectives and expectations,' the report read in part.

'The analyses we undertook found statistically significant disparities indicating that employees were more likely to receive higher or lower overall performance ratings based on their race, age, pay grade, bargaining unit membership eligibility, tenure or whether they worked within the agency. For these reasons, we have decided to revisit our approach to our performance management program.'

In an e-mail to all employees obtained by the American Banker newspaper, CFPB Director Richard Cordray claimed there 'was no single factor that caused this result.'

'We have determined that there were broad-based disparities in the way performance ratings were assigned across our employee base in both 2012 and 2013,' Cordray wrote. 'These differences indicate a systemic disadvantage to various categories of employees.'

In order to correct those 'disadvantages,' the agency has 'remediated' the compensation of employees, other than senior managers, who received overall performance scores of 3 or 4 during either of the last two years.

Instead of the result of their evaluations, they will be paid as though they had received a grade of 5.

'Everyoneâ€™s a winner!' quipped Bankstocks.com writer Thomas Brown. 'Only rather than a trophy, everyone gets cash money. Welcome to cloud-cuckoo land.'

'Hard-working, conscientious workers (and, yes, the federal government does have those) deserve to be treated better and paid more than workers who, say, persistently show up late and turn in shoddy work,' he added.

'Instead, in its pathetic bow to political correctness, the slackers are being rewarded.'

Cordray has presided over an agency that an outside investigator said was full of 'exclusion, retaliation, discrimination, nepotism, demoralization, devaluation and other offensive working conditions'

Silence: Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (R) was the agency's first chief, serving as 'special adviser' during its creation -- she has been quiet about her former bureau's problems

The Daily Caller reported that the latest embarrassment for the CFPB comes just one day before its senior managers will deliver subpoenaed testimony to Congress, addressing reports of retaliatory discrimination against some employees.

Hearings and subpoenas, however, came in response to complaints from a white attorney employed by the agency who said she experienced that sort of bias.

'Sadly, my story is not unique,' Angela Martin testified in April. 'My colleagues likewise have suffered and are suffering at the hands of inexperienced, unaccountable manager.'

The Washington Post first reported that Martin was black, but later corrected its story online.

Misty Raucci, a former investigator for an outside firm the CFPB hired to probe Martin's complaint, testified before a House Financial Services subcommittee  on April 2 that she found a work environment there rife with 'exclusion, retaliation, discrimination, nepotism, demoralization, devaluation and other offensive working conditions.'
