A Chinese man who is unable to use his arms has become something of a celebrity by threading needles with his feet.

Zhaojie Ping, 56, is also able to write, comb his hair and put on his glasses by just using his feet.

Zhaojie lost the use of his arms and became visually impaired as a child after suffering from several severe health problems including congenital rickets.

Zhaojie, 56, is even able to light cigarettes with his feet

He is able to brush his hair by clutching the comb inbetween his toes

The agile 56-year-old is also able to put his glasses on by lifting them up to this face with his feet

He learned to use his left foot to write Chinese characters while at school in Luoyang City, Henan Province, in central China.

The characters were so well drawn they were submitted regularly to local competitions where he won prizes for his skill.

His feet have now become his hands in many other areas of his life, including washing, shaving, cooking and even eating -  he uses chopsticks held between his toes.

'Life can be fair or unfair. It closed a door for me, but also opened a window,' Zhaojie said

He said: 'I feel blessed to be able to live a full life and now I am happy to lecture others on why it is important to live life to the full with what you have got, not with what you wish you had.

Zhaojie said: 'Life can be fair or unfair. It closed a door for me, but also opened a window.

'Although losing two hands, I still have two feet. The difference is I perhaps need a bit more effort than normal people.'
