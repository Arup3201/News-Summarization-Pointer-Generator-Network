A former police officer and his lover plotted to conceive a baby so they could abuse it and share it with other paedophiles, a court heard.

Alexander McCracken, 35, shared fantasies of raping and murdering newborn babies with his then-girlfriend Sharon Campbell and said he would 'deffo rape a little baby girl'.

Police found more than 500 hardcore child porn and bestiality images when they raided his home in Ayr, many of which were passed on to other paedophiles.

The pair are now facing jail after admitting three charges of possessing and distributing indecent images of children at Ayr Sheriff Court.

McCracken, who has a 10-year-old son, spent nine years with Strathclyde Police before being exposed in 2010 as a swinger and a £400-a-night bisexual prostitute, the Daily Record reported.

Police seized his computer and smartphone in last year's raid and found a string of sickening messages including one which suggests they breed a 'baby toy' and abuse it 'as soon as born'.

One, from a user linked to McCracken's computer, says: 'Oh would deffo rape a little baby girl.'

When asked if his girlfriend would let him, the reply was: 'It's the wife typing lol. I would help him lol.'

The usernames 'sleazyperv79' and 'NepicoupleUK' were linked to the computer and mobile used by McCracken.  

During one exchange, 'sleazyperv79' wrote: 'Three month old getting molesting … I hope he snuffed her eventually.' 

John Bradford, prosecuting, said: 'The chat indicates that the user has a predilection to violently sexually abuse these infants to death, or allow others do do so.

'The communications include content of a paedophilic nature, comments on the rape and killing of newborn babies and what purports to be a couple trying for a baby so that they can sexually abuse her.'

He revealed that cybercrime experts found 551 such images in Yahoo Messenger chat files after the raid in January last year.

The majority of the images were category five, the most depraved possible and most were passed among paedophiles between July 2012 and October 2013.

Mr  Bradford said: 'The images are predominantly of young girls, with the majority being newborn, babies and toddlers with a few up to about the age of eight.' 

Police were alerted to the couple's actions by the National Online Child Abuse Protection service.

Campbell, 39, who was a support worker for elderly people with mental health problems at a care home in Ayr, is no longer with McCracken. 

Her lawyer, Peter Lockhart, said: 'This is a frankly shocking and appalling offence and she recognises that. She has co-operated fully throughout and there is no getting away from it that a custodial sentence must be uppermost in your mind.'

McCracken's lawyer Jill Malloy said he complied fully with strict bail conditions and had no unsupervised contact with females under 16 and no internet use where history could be hidden. 

She added that he had lost his job as a factory production worker.

Sheriff Scott Pattison called for reports before sentencing next month. He said: 'These offences are of the utmost seriousness. You are fortunate you have been prosecuted in the sheriff court.' 

The usernames 'sleazyperv79' and 'NepicoupleUK' were linked to the computer and mobile used by Alexander McCracken.

Computer experts found apps including Internet Relay Chat, Yahoo Messenger and Gigatribe had been used. 

One message, from a user linked to McCracken's computer, says: 'Oh would deffo rape a little baby girl.'

When asked if his girlfriend would let him, the reply was: 'It's the wife typing lol. I would help him lol.'

Another message suggested they would breed a 'baby toy' now and abuse it 'as soon as born'.
