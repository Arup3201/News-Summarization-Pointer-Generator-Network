It’s every parent’s nightmare – being separated from their child in a busy street or shop, with no way of contacting them.

But now there’s a device that young children can wear that lets them call their parents at the touch of a button.

LG’s GizmoPal has just one button that allows children to make or receive calls, while concealing GPS technology that lets parents track their child’s whereabouts using a smartphone app.

LG’s GizmoPal (pictrured in pink and blue) has just one button that allows children to make or receive calls, while concealing GPS technology that lets parents track their child’s whereabouts using a smartphone app

It was originally launched in South Korea as the KizOn but has now been rolled out in the US as GizmoPal.

Children over the age of four can call a pre-programmed number by pressing the only large button on the device, which comes in pink and blue.

They can receive calls from up to three numbers in the same way and talk into the speaker which is built into a durable rubber band. 

LG says the smartband is ‘built to withstand the playground’s most ambitious set of monkey bars.’

The device can play fun sound effects and also read out the time for children.

Parents with Android phones can receive their child’s anticipated location information automatically at pre-scheduled times by using a feature called ‘Location Check’ so they know if their child is where they should be at different points in the day - for example, when walking home from school (illustrated with a stock image)

The wearable has one large button that can be pressed by children to make and receive calls. They talk into a concealed microphone.

The device is designed to be worn by children over the age of four and has launched in the US.

It claims to be tough enough to be worn while playing sports or in the playground.

Children can make a call to one pre-programmed number by pressing the button.

All a child has to do is press a button to answer a call, followed by speaking into GizmoPal and listening through its speaker.

The wearable works to an app designed to be used on an adult’s smartphone.

It lets them check their child’s location using GPS, which is built into the band. 

It links with an app for iPhones and Android handsets that can be downloaded onto parents’ smartphones, allowing them to set up the wearable and use GPS to track their child’s location at all times.

Parents with Android phones can receive their child’s anticipated location information automatically at pre-scheduled times by using a feature called ‘Location Check’ so they know if their child is where they should be at different points in the day.

‘For example, if you know your child normally gets home from school at 3:15pm you can set a reminder for that time and get a notification on your phone so you can check whether your child gets home on time,’ the company says.

Despite its simplicity, the GizmoPal costs $80 (£51) and requires a Verizon contract to work which will cost $5 (£3) a month.

There is no news as to whether the gadget will come to the UK.
