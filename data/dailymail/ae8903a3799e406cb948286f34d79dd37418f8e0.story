Things are going pretty good in Detroit right now. They have won five out of seven and sit top of the NFC North ahead of their showdown with Atlanta at Wembley on Sunday.

And all that despite scoring just 20 points per game, which makes them the 25th best offense in the league.

'It's a work in progress,' quarterback Matt Stafford said at the team's base in Bagshot on Thursday. 'But we're trying to get better every week.

'Every time you get a group of 53 together year after year it's different. We have a new coaching staff implementing some of their stuff as well. I would say that there's a different culture and I think we're better for it.'

Detroit's strong start has been largely down to their dominant defense, led by their Ndamukong Suh up front. 

The Lions defense is giving up the fewest yards per game (290.3) and their 15 points conceded per game is bettered only by the Ravens (14.9).

'It's been fantastic,' Stafford acknowledged. 'They've gone up against some pretty tough offenses and faired really well. You see it every day in practice and you see it every day in the meetings. Their preparation is fantastic, we've got smart players, guys who have bought into a system and are playing extremely hard.

'When you get that, you know you're going to be successful. It starts from the coaching staff on down, but every one of those guys on defense is playing fantastic.'

The bottom line is the Lions are finding a way to win. That's despite having to deal with a number of injuries, most notably star wide receiver Calvin Johnson, and a new head coach and offensive coordinator.

'You're not going to play your best football every week,' Stafford said. 'You strive for it, you strive for perfection, but it just flat out doesn't happen. You have to find ways to win games and more often than not, we've been able to do that this year.

'It's testament to our team, our character, our coaching staff, everybody is all in on trying to find a way to win and get better as we do it.

'One of the beauties of this offense is you can kind of mould it around whoever is available. We found that out early in this season with multiple injuries and guys missing time in certain spots.'

Up against Stafford and Co this week is an Atlanta Falcons defense currently conceding 28.4 points per game – only St Louis (29.3) and Tampa Bay (34) are giving up more.

On the Falcons defense, Stafford said: 'They've had some key injuries in some spots so if you watch tape from earlier in the year it looks a little bit different from now. Their defensive coordinator (Mike Nolan) has been a really good defensive coordinator for a long time in this league.

'He's still got them playing some complicated schemes. It's tough to deal with, so mentality and physically we'll have our work cut out for us.'

Stafford also shrugged off suggestions that he has been holding back from throwing the ball deep and becoming a 'game manager'.

'I don't feel like I'm holding back,' the Lions quarterback said. 'I think defenses are doing a good job of trying to take that kind of stuff away. We've seen like we do every year quite a bit of split safety and deep coverage so I'm just trying to take what's there.

'I'm just trying to play the best football I can play. I've never really got in too much with labels. As to what type of quarterback I am, I just try to play each individual game as well as I can, do what I'm asked to do, and win them.'
