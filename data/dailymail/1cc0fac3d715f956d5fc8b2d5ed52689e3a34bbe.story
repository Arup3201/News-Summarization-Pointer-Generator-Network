Manchester United's shortcomings in defence were ruthlessly exposed by Leicester City on Sunday as Louis van Gaal's woeful start as manager continued.

While United were mesmerising going forward, they were absolutely shambolic at the back and conceded five goals.

The £150million lavished mainly on forward-thinking players over the summer has left the team looking imbalanced and some of that money would have been better spent on a world class centre half.

They did buy Marcos Rojo for £16m but he looked out of his depth at the King Power Stadium.

MATEO MUSACCHIO

The Villarreal centre back has been on United's radar for some time but previous regimes were concerned about whether he was tall enough at 6ft 1in. Tottenham failed to unravel his third party ownership and he remains on the market.

MATS HUMMELS

Simply put, Borussia Dortmund would not sell this summer. United will look into a deal for next summer but there are some reservations that while Hummels can defend, his lack of pace can sometimes leave him exposed.

FABIAN SCHAR

The Basle defender is intelligent and elegant on the ball, the qualities that Louis van Gaal admires, yet he may not be robust enough to manage the Premier League. Tottenham and Arsenal like him, as do Dortmund as they eye replacements for Hummels.

AYMERIC LAPORTE

The 20-year-old French centre back plays for Athletic Bilbao and his buy-out is already set at £21m He is still, however, a work in progress. Barcelona are keen while Real Sociedad's Inigo Martinez, 23, is another option for them and United's scouting network.

MARQUINHOS

PSG's acquisition of David Luiz prompted questions about the future of Marquinhos who despite being just 20 is an accomplished performer. Yet he has played so well the questions are now being asked about Thiago Silva's role in PSG's future instead.
