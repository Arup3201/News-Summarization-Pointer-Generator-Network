Friends and family will attend a private funeral for Gary Speed this week with a public memorial  service to follow soon, said his widow Louise yesterday.

The football world was left in shock when the Wales manager and former player, 42, was found dead in his family home a week and a half ago.

Mrs Speed also thanked the public for the flood of tributes paid to her husband.

She was in the stands with their
son at Elland Road, the home of Gary’s first club, Leeds United, to 
witness thousands of football fans pay their respects on Monday.

A statement issued on her behalf said: ‘Louise Speed and her family wish to express their deep appreciation for the very generous and clearly heartfelt tributes paid to Gary and his memory by the public and all forms of the media.

‘Mrs Speed is especially grateful for the sympathetic way that the media has respected the family’s privacy in these extremely  distressing circumstances.

‘A memorial service to celebrate Gary’s life will take place soon and hopefully this will allow as many people to attend as wish to be there to pay their final respects and tributes.’

The family requested that any donations in the former midfielder’s memory be made to the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation or the John Hartson Foundation.

The much-respected footballer, whose performance as Wales manager had been widely praised, appears to have taken his own life at his home in Cheshire only hours after appearing on television.
