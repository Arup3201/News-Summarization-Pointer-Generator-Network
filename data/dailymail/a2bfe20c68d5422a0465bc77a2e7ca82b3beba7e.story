Cesc Fabregas has revealed a return to Arsenal was never on the cards because the Gunners didn't take up the option to re-sign him.

The Spaniard had a buy-back clause in his contract with Barcelona, allowing Arsenal to have first pick on signing him if he left the Nou Camp.

But after Arsene Wenger failed to move for him during the summer, Fabregas signed for Chelsea in a £27m deal.

The midfielder told The Sun on Sunday: 'I can understand some people at Arsenal are sad, some people are upset, some people are even angry.

'But changing clubs is part of the game and people must remember it was Arsenal who didn't take up the buy-back option for me.

'So what am I going to do - retire? No way!

'I have to look after myself. I had to make a decision.'

Fabregas said there would have been a 'reaction' from Arsenal fans whichever club he'd joined and has no regrets about linking up with Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge.

He also admitted he has not spoken with Wenger since his move but doesn't believe they have a fractured relationship.

'I'm sure once everything dies down a bit in the future we will talk. There is no problem,' he said.

Fabregas also defended himself against accusations from Arsenal fans that his celebration after scoring in Chelsea's Champions League draw with Schalke was making a mockery of them.

Fabregas appeared to be patting the Chelsea badge, just like he did when celebrating goals at Arsenal. 

But he insists he was simply patting his chest and wouldn't intentionally cause offence to his former employers.
