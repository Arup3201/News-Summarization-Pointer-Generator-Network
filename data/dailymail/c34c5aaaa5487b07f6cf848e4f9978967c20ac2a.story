Grigor Dimitrov may call Andy Murray a ‘cool dude’ and enjoy a joke when their respective coaches compete in a chest-beating 200m sprint, but any friendship will be left firmly in the locker room as Centre Court rises for a meeting of the king and the prince.

The 23-year-old became the first Bulgarian man to make it to the Wimbledon quarter-finals by dispatching Leonardo Mayer 6-4, 7-6,  6-2 in a rain-interrupted match that never really sparked into life.

Dimitrov knows he will need to play  better to challenge the defending champion in Wednesday’s encounter, but he enters the contest on the back of victory in their most recent match and has the confidence of a champion.

He beat Murray in an epic three-setter in Acapulco in March and claimed the Queen’s title this month too.

While he is pleased to break new ground for his country, he wants more. ‘First of all I’m happy I’m in the quarter-final match,’ he said.

‘I’m just going to give credit to myself for that. But my job isn’t over.

‘Every tournament I enter is to win the whole event. I think that’s the whole point of competing. I take all the confidence from Queen’s out on the court on the grass here.’

Cool dude: Dimitrov beat Murray when the two met in Mexico earlier this year

Dimitrov called his win in Mexico ‘one of my best performances of the year’ but wants to better it at the All England Club. ‘It’s his home basically,’ he said. ‘I’m not going to step back. I just want to come out with my big game and play my aggressive tennis.’

Last week Dimitrov’s coach Roger Rasheed beat Murray’s fitness coach Jez Green in a sprint at Wimbledon Park’s athletics track with the two players laughing from the sidelines. That fun will disappear tomorrow.

‘I think we get along pretty good,’ Dimitrov said. ‘We always have a lot of jokes. One thing is off the court, another thing is on the court. Basically you can settle everything on the court. Hopefully it’s going to be no hard feelings after the match.’
