The 1980s New Wave rockers Flock of Seagulls lost $70,000 worth of guitars and other music gear to a car thief who stole their van as they slept at a Downey, California Comfort Inn.

On Sunday following a gig, surveillance footage shows someone driving off from the group’s hotel with a van filled with everything they were about to take with them on a European tour.

Now the band, best known for the their 1982 hit I Ran (So Far Away), have left for UK tour dates without custom-built guitars, stage clothes, and other items—some of which they’ve had since their early 80s heyday.

Then: Flock of Seagulls had their biggest hit in 1982 but still perform. After a recent California show, a car thief stole $70,000 worth of their music equipment

It was just after a Bellflower, California show. The group returned to their hotel to rest prior to a final show in Southern California before jetting off for a performance in Scotland.

Though one night’s accommodations in the Comfort Inn run $99, the group left about $70,000 poorer—the cost of their treasured one-of-a-kind guitars, drum kit, and keyboard.

As they slept, surveillance tape shows a man break open their door and drive off with the equipment-filled vehicle.

Big loss: While the Comfort Inn room cost just $99 per night, the band's custom guitars and other equipment--worth $70,000--was the loss that truly hit them where it hurt

Doesn't gel: Mike Score (left in 1983, right at present) believes someone who attended their Bellflower, California show knew what he was doing when he drove off with a van full of expensive gear, though a local police officer does not believe the band was targeted specifically

Origins: Formed in the late 70s in Liverpool, England by brothers Mike Score (center) and Ali Score (right), the band continues to be active, though with a different lineup

Now: Lead singer Mike Score has lost the trademark hairdo, and while he slept in a Downey, California Comfort Inn on Sunday he lost all his band's equipment and a recently recorded solo album to a car thief

‘Joe’s guitar was hand-built. I use a couple of Fenders that are customized,’ lead singer Mike Score, who now opts for a clean-shaven head instead of his former trademark pointy bangs, told KTLA.

Also stolen in the van were hard drives that contained an entire new solo album recorded by Score.

‘That's like a year and a half worth of work that I can't replace,’ Score told KABC.

Lead guitarist Joe Rodriguez was also hit hard by the theft.

Creeper: Footage shows a man creep up to the van as it sat parked outside the Comfort Inn's reception area

Get away: The thief then drives off, along with $70,000 worth of equipment

‘It gives you a sick feeling inside knowing that that equipment that you own and used to play shows and that you've been using for,’ Rodriguez told KABC. ‘Twenty years have just disappeared.’

They’ve now left for Europe sans their gear, but hope to improvise a way to perform without it.

Seasoned: After 30 years, the band still tours, though they now get much smaller crowds than in their early 80s heyday

Not the same: The band is seen, at left, performing with rental equipment on the day following the theft instead of their treasured instruments. at right, they perform in their 1980s heyday

'20 years have just disappeared': Lead guitarist Joe Rodriguez said he felt violated after the theft Sunday. 'It gives you a sick feeling,' he said.

'It's going to ruin our shows': The group has now flown off for European tour dates, but must use rental equipment

‘For us, it's going to ruin our shows,’ Score said. ‘Our gear is specifically programmed for us.’

The man drove away in the band’s white 1999 Ford E-350 van with Florida plates. It was parked in front of the Comfort Inn’s reception area.

The band is hoping the thief or thieves don’t get away with selling the equipment. They urge anyone with information to call Downey, California police at (562) 861-0771.

Watch flock of Seagulls then and now...
