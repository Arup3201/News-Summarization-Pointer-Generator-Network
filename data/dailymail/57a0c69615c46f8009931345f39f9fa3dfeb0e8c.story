Officers later obtained CCTV footage on the train to help identify Neil Docherty, 43, after passenger complaints

An investment banker racially abused a woman on a late-night train, saying: 'Go back to your own f*****g country.'

Neil Docherty, 43, of Linlithgow, West Lothian, also slapped the woman on the head on the Glasgow to Edinburgh rail service, a court heard.

And he ignored a female passenger who told him to shut up over his racist rant and said: 'It'll be a different story when they take over the world and you're all wearing burkhas!'

He later alighted from the carriage, but irate on-lookers aboard took Docherty's photo on a camera phone – and helped the authorities track down the investment banker.

Docherty appeared in Livingston Sheriff Court today on a bail undertaking and pled guilty to two racially aggravated offences.

He admitted assaulting Fella Hammach, 33, on board the train at Linithgow, West Lothian, on August 28.

He also admitted acting in a racially aggravated manner which caused or was intended to cause alarm and distress to Ms Hammach by shouting and swearing, acting in an aggressive manner and directing religious remarks towards her using racially offensive language.

Catherine Knowles, prosecuting, said the assault was witnessed by several passengers on the train, which was packed with revellers returning from a night out.

As the train pulled into Linlithgow station at around 11pm Ms Hammach was unexpectedly slapped to the right side of her head from behind.

Ms Knowles said: 'The accused was overheard shouting at her: 'Go back to your own fucking country. Muslim men are raping women'.

The prosecutor added a female passenger told the accused to shut up, but he ignored her and shouted: 'It'll be a different story when they take over the world and you're all wearing burkhas!'

He continued to make racial comments until he left the train at Linlithgow station.

Court heard investment banker Docherty told a female passenger on the train who complained over racist rant to shut up and added: 'It'll be a different story when they take over the world and you're all wearing burkhas!'

Mrs Knowles said a passenger collected the names and contact details of everyone who had witnessed the incident and passed them to the conductor who contacted British Transport Police.

Officers were waiting at Edinburgh to take statements from the travellers and a copy of the camera phone image. They later obtained CCTV footage from the train.

After a public appeal, Docherty surrendered himself to police and was detained.

He gave a 'no comment' interview and made no reply to caution and charge.

Gilliam Taylor, defending, said her client worked as an investment banker and would co-operate with the preparation of reports.

Sheriff Peter Hammond called for Criminal Justice Social Work background checks. Docherty will be sentenced later.
