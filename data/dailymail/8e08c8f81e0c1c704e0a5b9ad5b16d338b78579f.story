Wayne Rooney deserved to be sent off, irrespective of the Manchester United players' appeals for handball just prior to their captain's mindless act of aggression. 

West Ham’s Stewart Downing was breaking after a United attack, but he was still well inside his own half with plenty of opponents to beat, so any thought that this was a red card for the denial of an obvious goal scoring were well wide of the mark. 

Rooney’s act was a wild, violent kick at his opponent which deserves the three-match ban it carries.

While both managers made claims of refereeing errors I could see nothing wrong with West Ham’s goal, other than a goalkeeping error by David De Gea. 

And at the other end, assistant referee Andy Garratt was absolutely correct to signal that Kevin Nolan was in an offside position before he ‘scored’ West Ham’s late equaliser. 

Referee Mason was correct in ruling out West Ham's equaliser from Kevin Nolan (centre) for offside

Replays clearly showed that Nolan's head was closer to the Man United goal line than the United defenders

Only showing Diafra Sakho (centre) a yellow card for tripping Rafael (second from right) was also correct

Replays showing that his head was closer to the goal line than the defenders proving the decision, while close, was accurate.

Finally, there was the unedifying sight of United players trying to pressurise referee Lee Mason to dismiss Diafra Sakho when he tripped Rafael. 

It was a clear yellow card offence and a demonstration to England’s captain of how to stop a break away without getting sent off.

It was a mindless act of aggression that fully justifies a three-match ban

If Rooney wanted to stop a break away without getting sent off, he should have tripped his opponent in the manner that Diafra Sakho took out Rafael

Lee Mason was correct in ruling out Kevin Nolan's 'equaliser' as the West Ham player's head was closer to the goal line than the United defenders

The only error in West Ham's goal was made by David De Gea
