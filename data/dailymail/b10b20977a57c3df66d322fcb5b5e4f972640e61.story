Casey Anthony was forced to leave her South Florida hiding place and go on the run this weekend after her location was discovered by private investigators.

America's most hated mother began to fear for her safety and decided to leave the place she has been staying in since she was cleared of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee in July.

It was reported last week that she has been increasingly going out in public undetected because she is said to have put on so much weight she is virtually unrecognizable.

The private investigators who discovered where she has been hiding were said to have been hired by Zenaida Gonzalez, who is suing the 'tot mom' for defamation.

A source toldÂ RadarOnline: 'Casey absolutely flipped out when she found out that private investigators hired by Zenaida Gonzalez, discovered where she was.

'The private investigators were 
attempting to serve Casey with a subpoena to appear at the trial, which 
is expected to begin in January. Casey had been venturing out at night 
and the investigators had been tipped off by people who had seen her.

'Casey is a smart girl and quickly 
determined that she had been found and refused to leave the house or 
accept service of the subpoena. The P.I.s weren't stalking her or doing 
any surveillance, they just wanted to serve her and move on.

'Casey was extremely upset that she had been found because she had settled into a routine and felt safe in South Florida.

'Casey's lawyer advised her that she 
needed to move though and they worked together over the past two weeks 
to move yet again. She is hopeful this will be the final move before her
probation ends, at which time, she doesn't have to stay in Florida.'

It was reported last week that she is
planning on moving to Costa Rica when her probation is over. She is 
currently embroiled in a legal battle with Gonzalez after she told 
police that a woman with a name similar kidnapped Caylee.

Ms Gonzalez's attorney Jeff Dill told
RadarOnline: 'We had been trying for months to serve her and we were 
finally able to get it done this week after a lot of legal wrangling 
because Casey wouldn't accept the subpoena at the location she has been 
hiding out in.

'Our client is thrilled that Ms Anthony has now been formally served and it's a successful start in the proceedings.'

After her dramatic acquittal, Anthony
spent months in hiding where she reportedly just sits indoors on the 
computer while comfort eating - and so has piled on the pounds.

But a source has revealed that this 
new look - including a 'puffy face' - has apparently given her fresh 
courage as she has been leaving her home regularly.

'Casey has been venturing out on a much more frequent basis recently because she is almost unrecognisable,' a source told RadarOnline.com. 'She hasn't needed to wear a disguise because of the physical transformation.'

The source added that she has turned 
to comfort eating and pops out at night to rent films and collect food 
from restaurants - but won't stay anywhere too long.

'Casey doesn't feel safe anywhere and just wants to leave the country and begin a new life,' the source added.

It
comes after a source told People magazine that Casey remains unemployed
and has little money, while probation reports show she recently stopped
attending counseling sessions.

However, she has apparently started 
speaking to her estranged mother Cindy in a bid to get their 
relationship back on track, although she does not speak to her father.

Anthony
is also said to be 'annoyed' about having to take the stand again at 
the Orange County courthouse in January after her attorneys accepted a 
defamation subpoena.

She is being sued by Zenaida
Gonzalez, who shares the name of a fake babysitter Anthony initially told police had kidnapped her daughter. Anthony admitted
fabricating that story.

In hiding: Casey has been spending time with her new boyfriend who she made reference to in the new video

Anthony had been planning to leave 
Florida after her probation ends in August but this new court order 
means she will have to stay.

The source said: 'She was really ready to move on with her life. This has ruined everything.'

But despite being vilified by the public after going into hiding, Anthony has not entirely shied away from publicity.

In October she appeared in a video 
diary that she posted on YouTube. In it she said she was 'making changes
for herself', although failed to mention Caylee.

It has since been claimed that she become a newborn Christian and was been baptized again in a bid to symbolise a new beginning.

However, this apparent new devotion to faith has not stopped her revealing a string of racy photographs of herself.

Anthony is being sued by Zenaida
Gonzalez, who shares the name of 'Zanny the Nanny' who Anthony 
initially told police had kidnapped Caylee. Anthony admitted fabricating
that story.

It later emerged that Anthony, whose 
acquittal last July has been compared to the infamous OJ Simpson case, 
did not know anyone by that name and the real Miss Gonzalez is not even a
nanny.

Now Miss 
Gonzalez is suing her after claiming she lost her job and apartment due 
to the association with the disappearance of Caylee, whose body was 
found in woods near Anthony's home in 2008.

After initially sticking by the claim that the kidnapper had been kidnapped, Anthony's lawyers then insisted at the start of the trial that Caylee had accidentally drowned in the family's swimming pool.

It is this primary Inconsistency in her story that has sparked public outrage in the case and forced the defendant into hiding after her release.

Her attorneys asked that she not be forced to appear in court, saying she has received death threats since being found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter.

Hidden: Anthony has not been seen in public since her trial, and has spent most of the last 10 months inside

She was convicted of four counts of lying to police and is now on probation on an unrelated cheque fraud conviction.

But, as Anthony had not been seen in 
public, lawyers for Miss Gonzalez feared she might go missing and 
decided to track her down.

They
staked out her home for several days without Anthony appearing to be 
served a subpoena. Eventually, the defendant's lawyers intervened and 
said she would attend the court hearing.

'Our investigation team had her whereabouts pinned down,' Miss Gonzalez's attorney Matt Morgan told People magazine.

'Their backs were against the wall, so her attorneys said that they would accept service on her behalf.'
