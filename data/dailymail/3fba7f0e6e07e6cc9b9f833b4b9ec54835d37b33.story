A gun-slinging Alaska wildlife manager chased off a massive polar bear that broke into an 81-year-old's house in a remote community to feast on a drum of seal oil.

Armed with a 12-gauge shotgun and non-lethal firecracker
slugs, officer Ruby Kaleak rushed with a partner to a home where
a petrified resident reported a polar bear break-in on Friday,
the Alaska Dispatch News reported.

While scanning the property, Kaleak suddenly saw the bear
pop up, filling the entryway door-frame of Betty Brower's home
in Kaktovik, a 300-resident community in the North Slope
Borough.

The 81-year-old was home alone and hiding under a large
window from where she managed to radio for help.

'My mind was going incircles at the time,' she said 

'I was shocked. It was humongous ... Just the neck and head
was half the size of me, and I'm 5 (feet) 2 (inches) (1.57 cm),'
Kaleak told the paper after the encounter. 

'My mind was going in
circles at the time.'

She and her fellow wildlife manager were able to chase the
bear away from the house and no one was injured, according to
the report.

Neither Kaleak nor state wildlife or village officials could
immediately be reached for comment.

Bears in the area are drawn to the village for hunters'
leftover whale parts and often smell food in arctic entryway
porches used by some residents to store food.

Kaleak told the newspaper she has never had to fire a deadly
slug at bears advancing on people. 

The bears seem unafraid of
vehicles but when she jumps out of her truck they scurry off.

'I tell them: Yep, you better run!'' Kaleak said, according
to the newspaper.
