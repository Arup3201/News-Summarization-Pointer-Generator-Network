A Connecticut Rabbi got much more than he bargained for when he bought a desk off Craigslist recently - nearly $100,000 in cash.

Noah Muroff paid $200 for the sturdy wooden desk but when he stripped out the drawers and cabinets to get it through his front door, he discovered a shopping bag full of hundred dollar notes.

'The desk did not fit into this office by fraction of an inch,' Muroff said.

After pulling it apart, the New Haven man and his wife found the plastic bag.

'In the bag, I could already see through the bag, it looks like a one hundred dollar bill,' he told News 8. 'We open it up and it's full of cash. And we counted up and there's $98,000 cash sitting in the bag.'

The couple couldn't believes their eyes, but they knew exactly what to do.

'Right away my wife and I sort of looked at each other and said "we can't keep this money,"' he said.

They picked up the phone and called 
the original owner, whom they'd purchased the desk off earlier that day.
They recorded the woman's reaction on cellphone video.

She was speechless. 'Oh my gosh, because I... oh my God,' she said on the call.

She explained that she had stuffed her inheritance in the desk and forgot where she put the money.

The Good Samaritans returned the cash to the rightful owner.

'I can not thank you enough for your honesty and integrity,' the woman later wrote in a thank you note published by the Jewish news blog Vos Iz Neias.

'I do not think there are too many people in this world that would have done what you did by calling me. I do like to believe that there are still good people left in this crazy world we live in. You certainly are one of them.'

Muroff, who is a high school Rabbi at Yeshiva of New Haven, said the most important thing in life is to be honest. And that's the message his Craigslist encounter will send to his students.
