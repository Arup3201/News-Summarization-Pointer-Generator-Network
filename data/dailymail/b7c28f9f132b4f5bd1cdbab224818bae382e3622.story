Lee Bowen returned to a house he had burgled overnight to apologise almost a year after the crime

A burglar with a guilty conscience returned to a family's home to give them £400 in cash and apologise for breaking into their home while they slept, almost a year after the crime. 

Lee Bowen, 27, turned up at the house in Merthyr Tydfil in south Wales with a wad of bank notes to apologise for stealing mobile phones, a laptop and cash cards while they slept on New Year's Eve.

But the astonished family decided his apology was not enough and reported him to police, with Bowen being promptly arrested. 

Jason Williams said the money was 'no compensation' for what Bowen had put his family through.

The 'habitual criminal' had broken into the family home on New Year's Eve 2013 as they slept, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard.

But plagued by a guilty conscience, he returned to the house in November and said 'I burgled your house last year.. I'm very sorry. Here's £400.'

The family reported him to police and Bowen was arrested the following day. He admitted everything to officer, even taking them to the street and pointing out the house he had targeted.

The court heard Bowen has appeared in court 19 times for 45 offences including six previous house burglaries.

Andrew Davies, defending, said: 'Although a habitual criminal he is trying to get his life on track. He is attempting to turn his life around.'

A judge let Bowen walk free from Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court because he is trying to 'turn his life around'.

Recorder Paul Hopkins QC told him: 'I am satisfied that the time is right to give you the opportunity to make a life for yourself.'

Bowen offered the family £400 in cash by way of apology but they reported him to the police over the burglary

Bowen, of Merthyr Tydfil, was given a 12-month community order with supervision after he admitted burglary.

He was warned that if he breached it he could be looking at at least four years in jail.

Bowen was also told to pay the family £700 compensation - £300 more than he offered on their doorstep.
