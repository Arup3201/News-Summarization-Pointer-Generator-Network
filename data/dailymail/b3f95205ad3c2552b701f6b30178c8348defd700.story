Carlisle United boss Keith Curle has confirmed he will discipline any players found to be drinking in the city centre less than 48 hours before their 3-0 defeat to York City.

There were reports that around six players were seen drinking alcohol until 4am in Carlisle following the 1-0 win at Morecambe on Boxing Day.

The Cumbrians were then soundly beaten at home to York on December 28 to leave them two points above the League Two relegation zone.

Some Carlisle players reportedly went on a night out until 4am less than 48 hours before a match - none of the players pictured here are understood to have any involvement

And former Manchester City and England defender Curle said: ‘I’m disappointed and I’ll deal with it. I need to find out the facts. I won’t hide away from it.

‘I’m desperate to do well for this football club and if they aren’t on board then very quickly they’ll get off the bus. Just thinking about it is doing my head in.

‘The players know they are not to go out 48 hours before a game. Alcohol in your system after a game doesn’t do you any good.

‘They will be disciplined because it is not acceptable. I feel let down and it will be dealt with in front of the dressing room and in front of everybody. Everyone will be exposed.’
