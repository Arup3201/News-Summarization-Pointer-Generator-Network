Thousands of you sent in your protests against A&E closures – and this week we delivered two bulging mailbags full of your demands to David Cameron's doorstep.

Nearly 30,000 Mail on Sunday readers have called for the Government to reverse the policy of downgrading and axeing local casualty departments across England and Wales.

A total of 28,619 protests were lodged – 17,170 coupons, 7,377 emails and 4,072 text messages – all prompted by fears that the policy for big, centralised A&E departments could risk lives as it leads to longer journey times to hospital.

As your protests reached Downing Street, it emerged that:

A London Ambulance spokeswoman last night confirmed that the hard-pressed service is currently spending £60,000 each weekend on the private firms, plus unspecified further sums at what she termed 'busy periods'.

Yet under the closure plans, London is set to lose no fewer than seven casualty departments (one has already been lost). This will hugely increase the burden on the ambulance service.

Critical: Campaigners say changes are about cuts, not a better A&E service

As as well as travelling longer distances after answering 999 calls, it will have to pick up seriously ill patients who turn up at the so-called 'urgent  care centres' which are set to replace A&Es but in reality cannot treat any life-threatening conditions.

At just one of the hospitals where A&E is due to close, Ealing, there is already an urgent care centre which transfers up to 50 patients a day to casualty.

Currently, this is a short journey down a corridor, but if casualty closes, as planned, all the patients will have to be transferred by blue-light ambulance to an A&E somewhere else, probably West Middlesex 20 minutes away, or Northwick Park, 45 minutes away.

'There is a limit to what paramedics can do'

The ambulance service spokeswoman said that it hoped to be able to recruit new staff, and would discuss how to fund the extra demands A&E closures would create once a final decision on the cuts had been made.

Yet the ambulance service is facing steep cuts itself, with a requirement to slash £53 million – or 19 per cent – of its budget by 2015/16, which will include the loss of 560 front-line staff.

The pressure on paramedics is not confined to London. Alan Bush, who has recently retired after 35 years as a paramedic in Newark, Notts, where the A&E closed early last year, said: 'The closure meant we had to drive much further, and often you wouldn't know which hospital you were supposed to take a patient to.

'There is a limit to what paramedics  can do. Travelling further means you have to provide more treatment to try to keep a patient stable. On the other hand, you can't do much when you're hurtling along at 70mph.'

On average, it now takes emergency patients from Newark almost two hours after a 999 call to be handed over to an A&E department.

A&E scandal: Readers want the policy of downgrading and axeing casualty departments reversed

Meanwhile, casualty departments in London will face a huge increase of 47 per cent in the number of residents they will each serve if the closures go through, it was forecast last night.

New analysis shows that if the 32 A&E departments which existed in 2010 are cut to 24 across the capital, the number of people in the average catchment area will soar from 255,000 to 375,000 in 2020, once forecast population increases are taken into account.

Labour's City Hall health spokesman, Murad Qureshi, who compiled the analysis, said: 'Londoners face being caught in a pincer of far fewer A&Es and a thinly stretched ambulance service. It is truly shocking that the Government has left the NHS in such a mess.'

But an NHS London spokesman said: 'Any changes to NHS services will be led by clinicians, and local people will be fully consulted. Clinicians would not recommend change unless it improves patient care.

'Hundreds of lives have already been saved by treating life threatening injuries in fewer specialist centres and expert stroke units.'

Under pressure: Prime Minister David Cameron and Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, right, must act now

Last week, we revealed how a powerful lobby of 140 senior physicians, academics and surgeons signed an open letter to David Cameron calling for an end to the 'indiscriminate' closure of A&E units that will affect 26 hospitals. Their letter accused health chiefs driving through changes just to save money, rather than for valid clinical reasons.

The A&E closure in one area where the department is under threat, according to an official poll.Campaigners say the result undermines the local NHS chiefs' claim that their plan is supported by clinicians – an assertion repeated last month in newspaper advertisements designed to convince patients that closure would be a good idea.

They were placed by NHS North West London, where four out of nine existing casualty departments are set to close, including the one at Ealing Hospital.

A public 'consultation' on this plan ended last week, with a decision expected early next year.

But new figures from an official poll of GPs carried out as part of the consultation disclose that in Ealing only four per cent of the doctors – or one in 25 – supported 'Option A', the choice being backed by NHS bosses which involves the closure of the local A&E.

Less than half of the doctors eligible to vote did so. However, of those that did, 54.2 per cent backed 'Option C', under which Ealing A&E would stay open.

'The claim that the closure has clinical support is simply misleading,' local campaigner Colin Standfield told The Mail on Sunday.

He also called into question the way the survey was framed, as there was no option given for keeping all of the hospitals' A&E departments open.

'It was a case of ''which poison do you prefer, strychnine, arsenic or cyanide?'' ' he said.

He added that he and his fellow campaigners, including many doctors, are now consulting lawyers and intend to launch a High Court challenge if the closure plan is ratified.

'If this should go ahead, we would be looking at going for a judicial review,' he added.

In NHS North West London spokesman said it was 'not true' that the proposals lacked clinical support, saying: 'All medical directors of all the Trusts in North West London have publicly signed up to the case for change.'

He said the GP survey was 'all part of listening to concerns raised during consultation, and we are now analysing the thousands of responses we have had to see how we should develop our recommendations'.

The doctors' opposition has been shared by Ealing Council which has called on the Government to scrap the 'half-baked' plans to downgrade local hospital services.

The Labour-run council's cabinet held a special meeting to discuss a report from former NHS executive Tim Rideout, which raised serious concerns about the closures and dismissed the business case from health bosses as fundamentally flawed.

The council has also joined authorities from across West London to deliver 60,000 signatures in protest to NHS North West London headquarters.

Councillor Jasbir Anand, Ealing leader for health and adult services, said: 'We won't gamble with our health or be bystanders as our hospital services are dismantled.'

London Ambulance Service is already paying more than £3 million a year to private ambulance firms because it cannot cope with demand – a problem that will only get worse as journey times increase to more distant A&Es.

A survey revealed that only four per cent of GPs in one area backed the closure of their local casualty unit, as favoured by the NHS.
