A British flight attendant has been questioned by police in Dubai after his apartment was identified as the source of a fire which ripped through more than 100 homes.

Residents fled in their pyjamas and some were barefoot as they navigated burning debris falling from the Marina Torch tower - one of the world's tallest residential buildings - in the early hours of February 21.

Police have pinpointed the source of the blaze to an apartment belonging to a British national who works as cabin crew for an airline, local news websites have reported.

General Khalil Ibrahim Al Mansouri, head of the Criminal Investigation Department, told 7DAYS the man had been questioned but not arrested, but did not give a cause of the fire.

He said: 'The fire started in his flat and it’s routine procedure to question him and his family, who were inside the flat.'

The man was with his wife  on the 51st floor at the time but no criminal activity is suspected,The National reports. 

More than 100 apartments in the 86-storey, 330-metre-tall skyscraper - a new tower in the expat-heavy Marina district of the city - have been condemned and many stricken residents are still homeless.

Some are staying with friends and kind strangers while others have checked into hotels.

Westleigh Flynn, 37, is still living out of a suitcase after his $1.4million (£900,000) duplex property on the 79th floor was damaged in the fire.

Mr Flynn, who is originally from Dublin, Ireland and works as a hospitality investment consultant, was in London when the fire broke out but returned to Dubai to find devastation.

His home, which he rents with his boss, is one of the 101 apartments to be condemned.

He said: 'I was very lucky. A friend put me up for a couple of nights before I went to another friend.

'It's mostly water and smoke damage.'

Another Torch tower resident, who lived on the 81st floor with her sister, told MailOnline: 'We went back last week on Tuesday or Wednesday to check if the apartment was ok. 

'Luckily, the water system did not go off and nothing was damaged.

'Sadly, we were there not to settle back in, but to take the basics of what we needed, turned off all non-necessary functioning electronics, emptied out the fridge and freezer and left for Abu Dhabi to stay with family.

'They did not feel that my sister and I were safe at the tower and want to know, as much as everyone else, what caused the fire.

'When we feel it is safe enough to go back, we will.

'Our neighbours apartment was badly burnt on the opposite side, where the fire climbed up. It's sad because they're a big family and now have to move else where.'

Firefighters were able to extinguish the blaze in several hours after the fire alarm went off at around 2am local time.

Residents of at least one neighbouring tower were told to evacuate as a precaution, but they were later allowed back inside.

Video footage shows the blaze spreading through at least 15 floors as high winds whipped through the area, on the northeastern end of the densely populated Marina district.  

Debris from the fire cluttered nearby streets after the blaze was extinguished.  

Businesses and people living in nearby buildings came to the aid of the residents and the Italian embassy even sent chefs with pizza to raise their spirits.

An evacuation centre was set up in a conference space in the nearby Princess Tower and as daylight broke, bystanders and residents could see that external cladding on the corners of the building were charred black and mangled for dozens of floors.

Clean-up crews dressed in orange uniforms swept up pieces of shattered glass and other debris covering the street outside the building.   

Jannah Hotels & Resorts has since offered homeless residents free 20-day stays in luxury apartments. 

Chief executive Nehme Imad Darwiche told The National: 'Ten studios is what we can do, I wish we could do more.

'We owe it to each other to take care of our fellow citizens and I hope that others will follow our path.'

Cleanup: As daylight broke, residents waiting across the street to be allowed back home were able to see the extent of the blaze

Flaming material falling from the initial fire then set a lower part of the building ablaze, residents have said
