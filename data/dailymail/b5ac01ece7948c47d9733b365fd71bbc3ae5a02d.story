Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Kim Kardashian have long championed the lingerie worn as outerwear trend and it seems it's about to go mainstream.

Lingerie giant La Perla unveiled its latest collection on the catwalk in Milan on Friday and the runway was awash with lace bodysuits, cleavage baring leotards and sexy silk jumpsuits.

The brand, for which Cara Delevingne has fronted campaigns for, sent models down the runway in ultra feminine designs, including daring red corsets and more modest silk bottoms.

In keeping with the current trend for luxe lace, the garments came with sheer cutaways adorned with lace and stockings were made from the material du jour.

It has been a stellar year so far for the brand, which was established in 1954 in Bologna, Italy in the kitchen of corset maker, Ada Masotti.

They unveiled an Atelier collection at Paris Couture Fashion Week in January and called on Naomi Campbell, Isabeli Fontana, Natasha Poly, and Lindsey Wixon to showcase the designs.

Earlier this month, La Perla opened the doors to its global flagship on Old Bond Street, London.

Speaking to Vogue at the time, a spokesperson for the brand said: 'For La Perla it was all about fully leveraging the craftsmanship and the fine knowledge of modelling on the female body, which is an integral part of any garment we make.

'Choosing fabrics and techniques that represent sophisticated sensuality; thinking about the main concepts that are at the heart of the La Perla style philosophy.'
