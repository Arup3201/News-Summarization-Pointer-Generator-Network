On Tuesday, she was regal in eye-catching crimson for a state banquet at Buckingham Palace alongside the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

Last night saw Mexican First Lady Angélica Rivera on dazzling form for the second day in a row as she dressed up in a floor-length black dress and diamonds for a banquet hosted by the Lord Mayor of London.

Ms Rivera, 45, and her husband Enrique Peña Nieto, 48, are currently on a state visit to the UK, which began with a ceremonial welcome at Horse Guards Parade.

There, the glamorous political wife was spotted winking at the royals as she arrived with her husband, before smiling and laughing her way through the ceremony - indulged by an equally cheerful Queen.

Ms Rivera, a former soap star, was then squired on a tour of the Royal Collection by a clearly charmed Duke of Edinburgh, with the pair seen deep in conversation as they inspected a saddle presented to Prince Philip during a visit to Mexico in 1975.

Her whirlwind tour also included a solo visit to the set of Downton Abbey alongside the Countess of Wessex yesterday, with her husband spending much of the day at Downing Street instead.

But it was for the final evening of her stay that Ms Rivera really pulled out all the stops, arriving at London's Guildhall in a spectacular floor-length black dress, teamed with a pair of diamond drop earrings and a matching bracelet.

The banquet, which was hosted by the Lord Mayor of London, Alderman Alan Yarrow, and the City of London Corporation, is a state visit tradition, with invitations extended to all visiting heads of state.

Ms Rivera, who was presented with a pretty bunch of spring flowers as she arrived, spent much of the evening chatting happily to the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, who were also at the event, and Mrs Gilly Yarrow, the wife of the Lord Mayor.

On arrival, the couple were welcomed with a  Royal Salute fired from the cannons at the Tower of London during which a total of 62 shots were fired - the basic 21-gun Royal Salute, plus another 20 because the Tower is a royal palace and a further 21 for the City of London.

The Mexican National Anthem was then played and President Peña Nieto was invited to inspect a Guard of Honour before making his way inside.

At the end of the banquet, both President Peña Nieto and Lord Mayor Yarrow made speeches - in President Peña Nieto's case, for the second night in a row.

Today will see the presidential couple fly to Aberdeen to meet with Alistair Carmichael, the Secretary of State for Scotland, following a formal farewell from the Queen.
