Jury selection is set to begin today in the capital murder trial for the former Marine accused of gunning down famed Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle.

Eddie Ray Routh, 27, is accused of killing Kyle, 38, and Kyle's friend, father-of-one Chad Littlefield, 35, at a shooting range near Chalk Mountain, Texas on February 2, 2013.

Kyle, a married father-of-two, had been trying to help Routh deal with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder on the request of Routh's mother and had taken him to target practice when he was killed.

Routh, who struggled with PTSD after serving as a small arms technician in Iraq before leaving the Marines in 2010, is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

Accused: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, will go on trial next week for shooting dead Chris Kyle, 38, and his friend Chad Littlefield, 35, at a shooting range in Texas in 2013. Jury selection begins for the trial on Thursday

Opening statements are expected in the case next Wednesday. 

The upcoming trial has garnered attention after Kyle - who's recognized for having made the highest number of confirmed kills in American military history - was portrayed by actor Bradley Cooper in the Hollywood blockbuster 'American Sniper'. The film does not depict Kyle's death.

Around 800 potential jurors have been summoned for possible selection but about 500 are expected to actually report to the court. From that number, the judge and attorneys will choose 12 jurors and two alternates. 

Four sessions will be held over two days to accommodate all of the potential jurors.

Erath County District Clerk Wanda Pringle said she does not yet know if attorneys will choose to give potential jurors a questionnaire containing questions specifically related the Routh case.

Final jury selection is set for Monday and Tuesday. Opening statements are expected Wednesday.  

The court has already issued an extensive list of rules related to media coverage and police have issued information on road closures when the trial starts.

'American Sniper' is based on a memoir of the same name by Kyle, who served four tours in Iraq before retiring from the military in 2009.

The Clint Eastwood-directed movie earned a massive $107 million during its debut weekend at the North American box office, which was a record for a January opening.

'The movie has become a cultural phenomenon,' Dan Fellman, head of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., said of the film's success. 'It tore apart the record book and not by a little. By an enormous amount.'

It has been nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Bradley Cooper. 

Last month, Routh's attorneys said the scope of the film - from the amount of people seeing it in cinemas to the press it is receiving and Oscar nominations - will affect the outcome of the jury.

'The film will be an issue,' Routh's attorney, J. Warren St. John, told People magazine.

Concerns: Routh's attorneys have expressed concern at picking an impartial jury after the success of the film 'American Sniper', starring Bradley Cooper (pictured), which is based on Kyle's memoir

Arduous process: Around 800 potential jurors have been summoned to the center for possible selection

'I think any case with significant publicity has an issue with picking a jury. I've had them in the past, and anything that has significant national attention makes it hard to pick a jury.'

Jurors are picked on their impartiality, and the hope they know nothing about the case they about to hear and deliver a verdict.

In 2013, a judge issued the gag order preventing attorneys and family members and others from talking to the media, predicting widespread media coverage.

Routh's attorneys also lost a bid to have the trial moved out of Texas.

'Mr. Kyle is a hero in many people's eyes,' George Parnham, a Houston criminal defense attorney not associated with the case, told People. 'Due to the fact that this movie has gained intense public attention, it's doubtful that a fair jury can be selected anywhere.'
