There's a Picasso, Poussin or Pollock in every pooch, say the organisers of Britain's first exhibition of art by dogs.

A series of minimalist line drawings by a collective of canine artists has gone on show in a south London gallery, featuring pieces by more than 30 of the four-legged masters.

The artworks come from all corners of the dog art world, with masterpieces on show by spaniels, pit bulls, dachshunds and more.

Every dog has its day: Britain's first exhibition of art by dogs has opened at a south London gallery

Around 140 art buffs, "artists" and their owners attended the opening night of the Drawings by Dogs exhibition which is being held in aid of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.

A brainchild of London-based photographer Tom Lakeman,28, and Tom Webber,29, an advertising and marketing executive, the exhibition came about from watching a friend's dog nose its feeding bowl around the kitchen.

Mr Webber explained: 'We've seen art by elephants, horses and chimpanzees with a paintbrush attached to their noses, but we thought what about a dog?

'The dogs are given a bowl full of food that's sat on a piece of blank paper. Underneath the bowl is an oil pastel which leaves a trail as the dog pushes the bowl around with its nose.

For sale: The pieces are available for purchase, with a framed original costing £100 and all the proceeds go to Battersea Dogs and Cats Home

Dog's dinner: The dogs are given a bowl of food on top of a piece of paper, underneath the bowl is an oil pastel which leaves a trail as the dog pushes the bowl around with its nose

'The finished piece all depends on how hungry the dog is. The more voracious their appetite the more expressive the art.'

The pieces are available for purchase, with a framed original costing £100 and all the proceeds go to Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.

Mr Webber said: 'This is the first time we have made it public. We have tried it out with our own dogs and friends' dogs a few times, and have always wanted to do something like an exhibition with the home.

'We approached them a little while ago at a reunion and eventually we organised the exhibition.

'We are amazed at how well it went. So many people turned out and many brought their own dogs along too.

Showcase: When the piece is finished it is framed and hung on the gallery wall along with a portrait of the doggy artist

Good cause: The exhibition at the Gallery on the Corner, Battersea Park Road, London, aims to raise money for Battersea Dogs and Cats Home

Paws for thought: The exhibition, held just a short distance from the rescue centre in Battersea, will run until October 20, and anyone attending can take their own dog along to try their paw at painting

'Jeremy Hackett, the owner of the clothing company, happened to be in the area eating at a restaurant.

'He stopped by with his own dog after seeing all the people and dogs in the gallery and they made a piece of their own.

'There was lots of barking, one fight and a few wees but it has been a great success so far and we have raised a few hundred pounds for the charity.

'We hope that many more will come and appreciate the pieces.'

Three of the artists who contributed to the show were current residents of the home, while two had since been re-homed.

The exhibition at the Gallery on the Corner, which is a short distance from the rescue centre in Battersea, will run until 20th October 2013 and anyone attending can take their own dog along to try their paw at painting.
