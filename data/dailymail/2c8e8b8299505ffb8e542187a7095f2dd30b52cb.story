Russia's first glossy magazine for lesbians has gone on sale in Moscow amid growing anti-gay protests and a new law set to ban 'homosexual propaganda' nationwide.

The mag - called Agens - carries fashion features on men's clothes that fit women and women's true life stories about coming out in Russia, where single-sex relationships are still frowned upon.

Publishers have given the magazine an over-18s only classification to get round new laws that ban the promotion of a gay lifestyle to minors.

The bill has already passed its first reading in the State Duma parliament and is due to be debated again in May.

Agens editor Milena Chernyavskaya said: 'We don't want to promote conflict, we want to start dialogue between the gay community and the authorities.'

'If people are offended I want to talk to them,' she added.

But anti-gay MP Vitaly Milonov, from 
St. Petersburg, said: 'The magazine may be legal but we need to watch 
that this filth does not fall into the hands of minors.'

'Personally I'd be happier if someone started a new magazine about cats. They might have more readers,' he added.

The legislation being pushed by the 
Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church would make it illegal to tell 
minors information that is defined as ‘propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism,
bisexuality and transgenderism.’

A public kiss between two men could be defined as illegal 'homosexual propaganda' and bring a fine of up to £10,000.

Other laws that the Kremlin says are 
intended to protect young Russians have been adopted in recent months, 
including some that allow banning and blocking web content and print 
publications that are deemed ‘extremist’ or unfit for young audiences.

Lawmakers have accused homosexuals of
decreasing Russia's already low birth rates and said they should be 
barred from government jobs, undergo forced medical treatment or be 
exiled.

In a gay rights protest in December, 
Pavel Samburov, founder of gay-rights group the Rainbow Association, was
pelted with eggs by militant activists with the Orthodox Church seconds
after he and his boyfriend kissed.

He was arrested by police, fined £10 and detained for 30 hours first in a frozen van and then in an unheated detention centre.

The Orthodox activists were also rounded up, but were released much earlier.

Those behind the bill say minors need to be protected from ‘homosexual propaganda’ because they are unable to evaluate the information critically.
