Ryan Sidebottom ripped through the Nottinghamshire lower order to secure Yorkshire the County Championship for the first time in 13 years.

The former England fast bowler took four wickets on the final morning at Trent Bridge to bowl Nottinghamshire out for 177 and seal a win for Yorkshire by an innings and 152 runs.

James Taylor, who aside from a first innings duck has been in superb form recently, made a resolute 75, but wickets tumbled around him and the 36-year-old Sidebottom eventually removed him to make certain of the Championship title with a game to spare.

It is Sidebottom's fourth title, his second with his home county, following their last success in 2001, and Yorkshire's 32nd. His other two successes came with opponents Nottinghamshire before he returned north. 

The white rose emphasised their dominance of this year's competition, as they took charge of this match against their closest challengers Notts from the very first session.

A century from Adam Lyth, as part of an opening partnership of 176 with Alex Lees set the tone, and after amassing 532/9 declared, the pace attack set about dismantling the hosts.

Sidebottom and Josh Brooks shared seven wickets in the first innings, and eight in the second to win the game by an innings. 

Brooks described the title win as 'the best day of his life' while Sidebottom failed to hold back the tears during the celebrations.  

The shaggy-haired left-armer showed his enduring quality on the final morning, first swinging a ball through Gary Keedy's defenses and then having Chris Read caught behind with a jaffa of a delivery.

Luke Fletcher edged to second slip and then, after Adil Rashid's leg spin had removed Jake Ball, Sidebottom rounded of the game, and the season, with the wicket of Taylor.

If the shot which finally brought an end to Taylor's innings, a wild swipe which looped to gully, was out of keeping with his current form, the bowling performance was completely typical of Sidebottom's, and Yorkshire's season.  

Under Jason Gillespie's leadership the county have lost just once this season, winning eight of their 15 first class matches this season.

In fact, since the former Australian fast bowler joined in 2012, Yorkshire have lost just three times. 

They lead the table by 47 points with just one game remaining, and even with games in hand neither Somerset nor Warwickshire can catch them up.

England batsman Joe Root was leading Yorkshire in the absence of club captain Andrew Gale, banned by the England and Wales Cricket Board for this match and the last one of the summer in two weeks' time after his on-field spat with Lancashire's Ashwell Prince at Old Trafford.

Root, 23, has had many highlights for his country already - but this achievement is still one he will never forget.

'This is obviously very special ... to get this opportunity is very memorable,' he said.

'I didn't expect to captain the side.

'But unfortunately it came about, in bad circumstances, and it's credit to Galey that the way he has captained the side made it very easy for me this week.

'For a big club like us not to have won anything for such a long period of time is obviously very frustrating.

'I think the lads deserved it - they have played exceptionally well all year in all departments.

'The guys put in some great performances with bat and ball - which meant they captained themselves - and I only had to do tinkerings here and there.'

Permanent captain Gale had to watch the celebrations from the side before eventually being able to lift the trophy, and wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow said it took a gloss off the win.

'I'm absolutely gutted for Andrew, not being able to be on the pitch with us at those final moments, because he's been such a crucial part in what's been a fantastic season for Yorkshire,' said Bairstow.

Andrew Gale, banned for the final two matches of the season, comes onto the pitch to lift the cup 

'To drop himself at the start of the season at Middlesex shows the integrity of the bloke and shows how much the county means to him. 

'It was a real big team performance today and something we really wanted to do for Galey being sat up there. He's a very proud man and for him not to be on the pitch with us was desperately disappointing.

'It's definitely not soured it but it's still disappointing to find out the day after it happened that all of a sudden he's banned. 

'It's the fastest thing that I've ever heard of and we're all disappointed as a club that there wasn't a longer time taken to look into it perhaps. But that's the way that things have panned out. 

'We've moved on from that, taken it on the chin and come here and put on a fantastic display.'
