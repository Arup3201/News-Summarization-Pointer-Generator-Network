A TV weatherman has been accused of having sex with a 15-year-old girl at his home in a room he called the 'law and order' room.

Eric Law, who was an on screen presenter with the WLBT station in Mississippi, would invite the girl to stay at his home while his wife was away.

His sexual affair was discovered after the girl's parents became concerned about their daughter's close relationship with the married man.

Investigators viewed explicit Facebook messages between Law and the teen which led them to suspect they were having a sexual relationship.

The teen later told police she would go into his 'law and order' room where they had sex.

Law was arrested and charged with two counts of sexual battery and two counts of gratification of lust.

He was released from jail after posting $200,000 bond.

Law says on his blog that he is an avid fan of the TV crime show 'Law and Order.'

Suspended: Since his arrest, Law, pictured, has been suspended from WLBT in Jackson, Mississippi

Since his arrest, Law has been suspended from WLBT in Jackson, Mississippi.

A spokesman for the station said the suspension was until further notice.

Law writes about his life on his Google+ bio page where he says: 'That's right, I'm one of those TV weather people. I love God and am saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. I'm married. No kids, but my wife and I serve as uncle and aunt to many kids from church.'

Law has worked at WLBT since 2004 and says he met his wife in a Christian chat room in 1999.

He had an initial appearance in Madison 
Municipal Court about three hours after learning of the charges and 
surrendering to Madison police.

After the hearing, Matt Baldridge, Law's attorney, said he was pleading innocent.Â 

Under conditions of the bond, he is not allowed any contact with minor children, the victim or her family.

Each count of the sexual battery charges carries a potential penalty of up to 30 years in jail and a $10,000 fine, while each count of the gratification of lust charges carries a potential penalty of 15 years in jail and/or $5,000 in fines.

Sexual battery under Mississippi law is defined as sexual penetration with a child who is at least age 14 and under 16 years of age, while gratification of lust involves inappropriate touching of a minor.
