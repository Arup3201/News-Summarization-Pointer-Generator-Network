They might have recently announced the end of their relationship but that hasn't prevented Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton from remaining close friends.

Just this week the pair, who famously never married, were spotted out and about in London enjoying a day out with their two children, Billy and Nell.

The former couple were seen chatting amicably, looking completely happy in each other's company as they walked through the city's streets.

Still friends: Helena and Tim were seen strolling through the streets of London earlier this week

But they're not the only ones who have managed to keep a friendship alive despite the painful end of a long term relationship.

Indeed, Helena and Tim are simply the latest in a long line of celebrity couples who, despite splitting up, have remained friends.

Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin are still on good terms, despite consciously uncoupling, while David Arquette and Courtney Cox still spend plenty of time together.

So how do they pull it off? Relationship experts say that celebrities find it easier because they aren't under the same pressure as the rest of us, although that is by no means the whole story.

'The financial element is a part of why some celebrity couples can remain friends. They have less pressure in terms of childcare, money and housing,' comments dating expert Laura Yates.

'When it comes to finances, this is often where arguments and animosity can occur when couples split up. 

'A-list couples don't really have these financial challenges to contend with so that part of the process can be handled more easily.'

Another part of the equation is the desire to avoid unwanted media attention created by an acrimonious break-up.

'If there are children involved, they'll likely want to protect them from this,' adds Yates. 'When you're in the public eye and your split and feuds are all over the papers, it can be tough to handle.' 

HELENA BONHAM-CARTER AND TIM BURTON

Actress Helena and director Tim announced their split just before Christmas but revealed that they had actually been separated for some time.

A spokesperson for the pair said they had 'separated amicably earlier this year and have continued to be friends and co-parent their children.'

The couple had famously lived in two separate houses next door to one another with Helena telling the Guardian in 2010: 'It really is a great idea.

'You never have to compromise emotionally or feel invaded. He always visits, which is really touching. He's always coming over.'

The pair - who met when director Tim worked with Helena on the Planet of the Apes in 2001 - were seen earlier this week enjoying a day out with their children in London.

MIRANDA KERR AND ORLANDO BLOOM

Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr and actor Orlando Bloom announced their split in October 2013 but they've since been seen together several times since and remain good friends. 

The main reason for their continuing closeness is their son Flynn, four, with whom the former couple are regularly seen pounding the pavements in New York.

Speaking after their relationship ended, the model told Harper's Bazaar: 'We're really close, we're going to be a family forever and we both really do love each other.

'We have genuine love and respect for each other. We're very connected and I feel grateful for that. 

'We created something beautiful together and we both remind ourselves how lucky we are to have that. And yeah, it's good. He's a great dad. I'm lucky.' 

So close are the divorcees, not even Orlando's infamous dust-up with Justin Bieber this summer, which sparked rumours of an affair between the popstar and Miranda, has kept them apart.

Consciously friends: Gwyneth and Chris have maintained a friendship after splitting last year

GWYNETH PALTROW AND CHRIS MARTIN

Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's decision to 'consciously uncouple' was one of the most talked about celebrity events of 2014 with the pair going their separate ways in March after more than a decade together.

In an interview with American radio presenter Howard Stern, Gywneth, who has publicly wondered whether the couple would have been better off staying together, said: 'You say, Look, we're a family. We have kids.

'We're always gonna be a family, and let's try to find all the positives in our relationship, all the things that brought us together and the friendship. And we actually have a really strong friendship.

'There are times when it's really difficult and things happen and ... I'm sure he doesn't want to hang out with me and I don't want to hang out with him.

'But for the sake of your kids you do it but you also don't do it all tense. You really say, I really want to find my love for you.'

Close: Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe have remained close for the sake of their two children 

REESE WITHERSPOON AND RYAN PHILLIPPE

Reese and Ryan were one of America's cutest couples until they split in 2007 after seven years of marriage and two children: Ava and Deacon.

Ryan has said he believes he and Reese, 'have done a really good job at keeping things peaceable and completely focused on,' their children.

Reese, meanwhile, has admitted that they were perhaps too young to have been so committed: 'I was so, so young. I was, like, ridiculously young.

'I learnt a lot, though. It was an excellent opportunity for me to really find out what it means to be a partner and to be in a marriage and it’s not anything that I thought it was.' 

If you want to stay friends with your ex, relationship expert and author of The Dating Game Jo Hemmings says there are several things to consider.

Top of the list is your feelings for them but you also need to consider why you want to be friends and whether you can handle not having sex with them. Here are her top tips...

1. Consideration for each others' feelings during the break-up is one of the most important things you can do to try and stay friends afterwards. 

A relationship that ends in recriminations and hostility is far less likely to succeed friendship-wise post splitting up.

2. Don't think about having sex with your ex. However close you may have become since your relationship ended, this is likely to complicate things.

3. Allow your ex-partner to be angry for a while, especially if you were the one to initiate the break. It's a necessary and healthy part of getting through the process.

4. Give each other space. Breaking up and still hanging out together all the time and seeing mutual friends as if you were still a couple may give your ex-partner false hope of a reconciliation.

5. However hurt you feel, don't be tempted to place all the blame for the split on your partner. A little soul-searching and letting yourself shoulder some of the responsibility, however difficult that seems at first, is important for both of you to be able to move on as friends.

Double dates: Former couple Courteney Cox and David Arquette go on double dates with their new partners 

COURTENEY COX AND DAVID ARQUETTE

Former Friends star Courteney Cox and actor David Arquette married in 1999 but ended their marriage in 2010, eventually divorcing in 2013.

However, they still spend a large amount of time together. When David met his fiance, American TV presenter Christina McLarty, his former wife told the world of her support, saying, 'When you love someone, you want them to be happy, even if it's not with you.'

Courteney even revealed that she, David and Christina had enjoyed meals together. It has also been reported that David enjoys a close friendship with Courteney's new love, Snow Patrol guitarist Johnny McDaid. 

While the celebrity world is no stranger to couples who managed to make things work following a split, not every A-lister has been so lucky... 

Halle Berry and Gabriel Aubrey

Actress Halle and model Gabriel, who are parents to a daughter named Nahla, were at the centre of one of the most acrimonious splits in celebrity history in 2010.

After the pair, who dated for five years, broke up Halle moved on, eventually marrying French actor, Olivier Martinez. 

But when the new couple tried to move to his native France things turned nasty. Gabriel blocked the move and ended up in a nasty punch up with Olivier.

Not such good friends: Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen, Halle Berry and Gabriel Aubrey and Kati Holmes and Tom Cruise failed to stay friends when they split 

Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen

Actress Denise's divorce from a then drug addicted Sheen was particularly nasty. The pair, who have two children together, broke up in 2005 amid rumours of his breakdown. 

Things took a turn for the worse when Charlie branded Denise: 'A sad, jobless pig who is sad and talentless and sad and jobless and evil and a bad mom.' 

In response, she obtained a restraining order preventing him from coming near her, her home and car, and their two daughters, except during supervised visits. 

Happily for the girls, the pair have since patched things up.

Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise 

When Katie Holmes announced she was to divorce Tom Cruise in 2012 after six years of marriage it came as no surprise.

It was widely thought that the pair had clashed over Tom's involvement in the controversial religion, Scientology - something the actor later confirmed. 

The pair have not been seen together since with Katie taking full custody of their daughter Suri, now eight.
