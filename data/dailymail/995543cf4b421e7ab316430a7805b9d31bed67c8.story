The tempestuous love life of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton captured the imagination of a generation, and now a rare love letter written by the glamorous actress to her then husband has come to light, giving a rare glimpse into the fiery passion between them.

The steamy letter shows how she desperately fought to save their doomed marriage right to the end.

The letter opens with the line: 'I 
wish I could tell you of my....pure animal pleasure of you.' And ends saying: 'Anyway, I lust thee'.

The note, thought to be the only Taylor-Burton love letter ever to become available for public sale, was written by the late actress days before the pair separated and three months before they divorced for the first time.

Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton's passionate love life captured the imagination of a generation

Welsh actor Burton had numerous affairs 
during his 10-year marriage to his actress wife, who finally ran 
out of patience in 1974 - when he is said to have cheated on her with a waitress.

But on their 10th wedding anniversary and just days before they split, Taylor wrote of her love for her husband and her anxieties about their marriage.

She addressed the letter ‘My (still) husband’ and signed off ‘Your (still) wife’ and in between wrote: 'I wish I could tell you of my love for you, of my fear, my pure animal pleasure of you, my jealousy, my anger at you.

'Most of all my love for you and whatever love you can dole out to me. I wish I could write about it but I can only boil and bubble inside and hope you understand how I really feel.'

The private letter, written in pencil, was left behind by Burton at a luxury home the Hollywood couple rented in California while he filmed the 1974 movie The Klansman.

This gushing letter by Elizabeth Taylor to Richard Burton has emerged to show how the late actress desperately tried to save their doomed marriage. It starts, 'My Darling (my still) My Husband'

It was discovered in a book in a drawer in the bedroom by the owner of the property after the couple had left.

The letter is now being sold by Bristol-based dealers Paul Fraser Collectibles for £35,000. Paul Fraser, founder of Paul Fraser Collectibles, comments: 'This is one steamy letter, from one of the steamiest marriages in history.

'But what makes this letter particularly remarkable is its timing. Taylor wrote it on their 10th wedding anniversary, just three months before she and Burton divorced - the intense mixture of love and anger that Taylor has for her philandering husband is palpable in these lines.

'This is the only love letter between the two to have ever come up for sale. That makes this a very rare opportunity to own memorabilia from Hollywood’s most famous couple.'

Richard Burton, a heavy drinker and smoker, was Elizabeth Taylor’s fifth husband. The couple met on the set of the 1963 film Cleopatra and they wed the following year.

Taylor is said to have warned Burton from the start that she had zero tolerance for infidelity. However, during the filming of the 1968 classic war movie Where Eagles Dare, Burton had an affair with glamorous co-star Mary Ure.

He was rumoured to have had further extra-marital affairs with actress Genevieve Bujold, French model Nathalie Delon and Raquel Welch.

The celebrity couple divorced in June 1974 only to remarry in October 1975 and then divorced a second time in July 1976.

Burton died from a brain haemorrhage aged 58 in 1984 at his home in Celigny, Switzerland. Taylor died from heart failure in 2011 aged 79.

There is a huge interest in memorabilia associated with Taylor. In 2011 her jewellery collection sold at auction for £70 million.

A collection of love letters she wrote to her first fiance sold in the same year for £30,000.

My darling (my still) My husband,

I 
wish I could tell you of my love for you, of my fear, my delight, my 
pure animal pleasure of you - (with you) - my jealousy, my pride, my 
anger at you, at times.

Most 
of all my love for you, and whatever love you can dole out to me - I 
wish I could write about it but I can’t.

I can only 'boil and bubble' 
inside and hope you understand how I really feel.Anyway
 I lust thee,

Your (still) Wife.

P.S. O’Love, let us never take each 
other for granted again!

P.P.S. How about that - 10 years!!
