A top grammar school has been fined £10,000 after a 14-year-old boy was smashed in the head during a shot put event and left with life-changing injuries. 

The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull with the metal shot at the prestigious Judd School, in Tonbridge, Kent.

The year nine student then underwent emergency brain surgery for 'potentially fatal' injuries after fragments of skull went into the teenager's brain. 

A top grammar school has been fined £10,000 after a 14-year-old boy was smashed in the head during a shot put event and left with life-changing injuries. The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was hit on the back of the skull with the metal ball at the prestigious Judd School, in Tonbridge, Kent

The boy, who was formerly a keen rugby player, has been told he will never play again.

The victim had been part of a class of 24 Year nine pupils taking part in a multi-sports PE lesson on June 20 last year hugely over-subscribed grammar school.

The lesson included discus, triple jump, long jump, javelin, hurdles and the shot put.

But health and safety guidelines say the 1,000-pupil school should have had a maximum of four sports, with just one throwing event, going on at the same time.

The pupil suffered a severely fractured skull and was rushed to Kings College Hospital in London.

He was due to have an operation to alleviate the swelling in his brain but it was decided the surgery could have worsened his condition.

A few days later his condition deteriorated and he underwent emergency brain surgery to remove fluid from the brain.

The school's governing body was hauled in front of Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court today charged with breaching their general duty to the pupil.

The victim had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson

Prosecuting, Kevin Golding said: 'It's unclear what the long term impact will be.

'He has recovered sufficiently to return to school but we don't yet know the long term impact on his memory, intellect, mood, personality and his future employment prospects.'

The court heard the teacher in charge, David Joseph, has taught at Judd for 10 years, and has been a teacher for 28 years overall.

He was in the centre of the sports field overlooking the javelin throwing pupils when the incident happened.

The victim had been part of the triple jump group and was returning to the centre of the field as the teacher whistled to signal the end of the lesson.

But the pupil who threw the shot says he didn't hear the whistle, the court heard.

He started the throw with his back to the landing area the victim was stood beside, and it hit the victim on the head.

Defending, Dominic Adamson said that although the boy's injuries were the result of an unfortunate accident, the health and safety procedures in place were not conducive to a serious risk of it happening.

The court heard the victim was a very keen sportsman and particularly enjoyed rugby.

Because of the injuries he sustained and the indentation to his skull, it was said that he will never play again.

Mr Golding said: 'The victim was seriously injured and fortunate not to have suffered fatal injuries.

'He has sadly suffered life changing injuries which could have been avoided.

'He was a very keen sportsman, particularly his love of rugby, and the damage and indentation he still has at the base of his skull means he can't play rugby anymore.

'He and his family have endured a difficult nine months and face more difficult times ahead.'

Chair of the bench Nick Bensted-Smith said the victim had suffered a 'very serious and devastating injury' as a result of the incident and the school received a fine of £10,000, legal costs of £1,375 and a victim surcharge of £120

The teacher is not facing any disciplinary action by the school and has not been charged with any criminal offences.

The Judd School pleaded guilty to the charge of failing to ensure that a child in their care was, so far as is reasonably practicable, not exposed to risks to their health or safety.

They suspended their athletics lessons until a full audit was done and revised health and safety measures had been put in place.

Head teacher Robert Masters said: 'The Judd School expresses its deepest regret over the serious accident which took place in a PE lesson on 20 June 2014, when a student was hit on the head by a shot put thrown by another student.

'It is a relief to all that the injured student has been attending school full-time since September.

'The Judd School accepts the verdict of the Magistrates' Court today that it has breached the Health & Safety at Work Act.

'In particular the school's organisation of the PE lesson in which the incident occurred did not fully comply with the guidance of the Association for Physical Education. 

'The safety record is exceptionally good; however this incident has led to a major review of safety by staff and governors.

'We have re-examined all our safety procedures in PE and are in the process of doing the same across the whole school. We have also shared the lessons from this incident with other secondary schools.

'Whilst accepting that we cannot eliminate accidents altogether, we are as confident as we can be that a similar accident will not happen again in future.'
