Most hoteliers have stories to tell about demanding, stroppy guests whose manners leave a lot to be desired. Jackie Ferrier, who runs an upmarket establishment in the heart of the New Forest, is no exception.

The morning I visit, Sebastian — the guest in the hotel's most exclusive suite — was so eager for his room-service lunch that he launched himself at poor Jackie, swiping the plate clean out of her hand before rudely eating his lovingly prepared tuna dish from the floor.

As for Sid — in a cheaper room down the corridor — well, he's already knocked his TV over and is making a racket as he sulkily kicks his remote control around the room. But none of it fazes Jackie. Nothing is too much trouble for her pampered guests, whether they have special dietary requirements, want to make Skype calls to loved ones... or just have their noses stroked and their tummies tickled.

Pur-fect: Feline guests at Hotel Cat get their own human-sized beds 

Creature comforts: The rooms are equipped with toys, beds and even a TV

Yes, the residents at this upmarket hotel may be somewhat lacking in manners, but they're not rowdy rock stars or drunken travelling salesmen. They are cats — much-loved family pets whose owners can't bear the thought of putting them in a cattery when they go away.

Hotel Cat has been officially open for business for only a month, and it still has that fresh paint smell.

At first glance, it could be a very select boutique hotel for humans — the kind you read about in glossy magazines.

The reception area is clean and airy with a vase of brightly coloured flowers. The main hallway is lit by chandeliers, while a 6ft Christmas tree sparkles with fairy lights.

It's not until you peer a little closer into the rooms and clock the toy mice, scratching posts and climbing frames that you realise who it's catering for.

Hotel Cat is the brainchild of Jackie and Tim Ferrier, who ran a dog hotel in Devon along similar lines. They sold up, bought a 20-acre property in Hampshire, and describe themselves as 'the world's worst farmers' — buying animals and becoming too attached ever to slaughter or work them.

No expense spared: It costs between £19 and £34 a night for cats to stay in their own suite 

Pets deserve to be pampered: The hotel was the brainchild of Jackie and Tim Ferrier who were shocked by the way cats were treated in some catteries

Today they play host to a menagerie of chickens, ponies, sheep, goats and donkeys.

It was after visiting a regular cattery earlier this year that Jackie realised the moggies have been missing out.

She tells me: 'It was a well-known cattery, but I was appalled at the conditions the animals were kept in.

'The runs, in which they spend 24 hours, were tiny. They had no room to roam, explore or play. For a cat used to being outdoors, it would be particularly stressful.

'At least dogs in boarding kennels are taken out and walked every day, but cats are pretty much just fed and forgotten about.

'Our three cats are so much a part of the family, and I hated the idea of them being locked up like that.'

Instead Jackie and Tim —who are helped out by their two animal-mad teenagers, James, 18, and Lucy, 16 —ploughed their savings into creating this top notch home-away-from-home for cats.

The hotel comprises seven rooms, all 'en suite' — in that each leads to a private play area via a cat flap

Home-from-home: The family used their savings to make the hotel for cats a reality

Fun: The rooms contain every type of cat toy you can think of, from giant foam fish to plastic snakes and furry animals

Hotel Cat is a lavishly converted barn a stone's throw from the family's home. It comprises seven rooms, all 'en suite' — in that each leads to a private play area via a cat flap.

Costing between £19 and £34 a night, all suites have a flat-screen TV and DVD player, cushions and a proper human bed — not a basket — with a duvet and blanket.

That's not all. The rooms contain every type of cat toy you can think of, from giant foam fish to plastic snakes and furry animals. Bedrooms are heated to a tropical 70F and there's a choice of entertainment, from movies to music.

I wouldn't have thought your average cat was too fussed about entertainment, but the occupiers of the Royal Mews prove me wrong. Sebastian, a silver tabby, is transfixed by The Little Rascals, playing on his DVD.

'They respond to the sound and moving images,' says Jackie. 'People always assume cats just take care of themselves. It's true that cats are much lower maintenance than dogs, but they're not total loners.' Sebastian shares his suite with Sweep and Stella, a pair of short-haired Persians with whom he usually lives in Central London.

Peace of mind: Owners know their cats are being well-cared for while they go away

Relaxed: This cat clearly finds his bed comfortable following a bedtime story

Luxury: All the rooms have en suites and room service serving seafood canapes

The trio have been at Hotel Cat for six months — before it officially opened — as their owners, a solicitor and his wife, are caught in the middle of a complicated house move.

By my reckoning it's cost more than £8,000, which would buy you a week in a suite at the Dorchester.

But what price peace of mind? Jackie emails owners weekly bulletins, detailing their cats' health, mood and food intake.

And when it comes to food, the Hotel Cat lives up to its five-star billing. There are seafood canapés from £4, or smoked salmon and prawns in seafood sauce for £6. All dishes are served with mineral water (no cloudy tap water for these VIPs).

Wish you were here: Jackie emails owners weekly bulletins, detailing their cats' health, mood and food intake or they can Skype

Despite the expense, Hotel Cat is fully booked for Christmas. Residents can expect to wake up to a stocking filled with presents, followed by a gourmet turkey dinner.

'The message is loud and clear,' Jackie says. 'Owners really dislike traditional catteries. So many people have said: 'Finally we can go on holiday without worrying.'

With that, she starts her wind-down routine for her guests. Soothing music is played, lights are dimmed, litter trays are emptied, and the cats are gently stroked while bedtime stories are read.

Never mind the animals, this place is the cat's whiskers.
