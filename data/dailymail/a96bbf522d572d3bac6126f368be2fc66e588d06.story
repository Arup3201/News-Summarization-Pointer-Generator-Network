Most wanted: Saudi bomb maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri, who is described by a US official as 'an evil genius'

The hunt is on to find Al-Qaeda's 'evil genius' - an explosives expert believed to be behind a terrifying plot to target trans-Atlantic flights using human bombs.

Ibrahim Al-Asiri, who has survived numerous assassination attempts, is understood to have perfected a device which can be sewn into a human body making it almost impossible to detect by airport security scanners.

The 32-year-old is believed to have led a team of bomb makers based in Yemen which has already produced several of the devices after linking up with extremists fighting in Syria.

The technology is already thought to have reached British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It is now feared they will return to target flights leaving the UK.

In response, security at airports across 
the world is being stepped up after US counter-terror chiefs received 
what they described as a 'credible' terror threat.

In April this year Al-Asiri survived a US special forces ambush in southern Yemen, when a 4x4 he was believed to be travelling in was targetted in a drone strike and ground assault.

Security expert Will Geddes yesterday described Al-Asiri as Al Qaeda's ‘number one bomb maker.’

He said: ‘Security experts are worried that there has been more bomb training in some of the terror cells across the Arabian peninsula

‘The technology for bomb making is better than it was ten years ago. That makes it easier to share the information.

‘It could be using a chemical that the scanner doesn't recognise, at a chemical level.

‘We're talking about objects that are made from innocuous materials, chemicals that slip under the radar.

‘Think of it as a way to confuse the technology in scanners. It could be the substances in a printer cartridge.

‘With all the warnings about Al-Asiri, it means airport security teams have to be a lot more vigilant.

‘As we know there's a lot of linkage between Al Qaeda and this man. He's a constant threat. He's their number one bomb maker.

‘They have been after him for years. It's believed he has been training other members of Al Qaeda to create devices. He operates across Yemen and the Arabian peninsula.’

In response to the threat, security was
 being ramped up at airports across Britain. Passengers at Heathrow were
 being asked to switch on laptops and mobile phones to prove they were 
functioning properly.

In addition, 
electronic equipment, clothing and shoes were being swabbed to test for 
traces of explosives and the number of sophisticated body scanners at 
British airports has been raised from ten to 21.

At
 Manchester, extra machines were sent to departure gates on 
transatlantic flights to allow staff to swab hand luggage at boarding as
 well as at security. Electronic devices and footwear are being 
subjected to greater scrutiny.

The measures are likely to lead to delays during the summer holidays when Heathrow alone has 200,000 passengers a day.

British prime minister David Cameron insisted yesterday that safety comes first.

He
 said: 'This is something we’ve discussed with the Americans and what we
 have done is put in place some extra precautions and extra checks.

‘The safety of the travelling public must come first. We must not take 
any risks with that. I hope this won’t lead to unnecessary delays but 
it’s very important that we always put safety first.’

Airports
 last night insisted planes would not be delayed – but passengers may 
have to arrive at gates earlier to go through the new procedures.

Security has been stepped up across airports in Britain with new state-of-the-art scanning equipment being brought in and passengers being warned to expect delays

Al-Asiri's sinister creations have also been used on two high-profile terror attempts in the US, including the underwear bomb carried by Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 passengers over America on Christmas Day 2009

'It has also been suggested that ‘sky marshals’ – undercover armed police – could be brought in on some routes.'

Deputy Prime 
Minister Nick Clegg warned that the new checks were unlikely to be ‘a 
one-off, temporary thing’.

He said: ‘This is the world we now live in.

‘I don’t want people to think that this is some sort of blip for a week.

'This
 is part of an evolving and constant review about whether the checks in 
our airports - and indeed other places of entry and exits from countries
 - keep up with what we know from intelligence and other sources about 
the nature of the threats we face.’

Al-Asiri's
 bombs are of particular concern as they contain no metal elements, 
meaning they are virtually undetectable and can evade airport security.

Incredibly he carried out one test using his willing younger brother, Abdullah, who had a bomb implanted in his body for an assassination attempt on a Saudi Arabian prince.

Although the device went off as planned, Abdullah succeeded in killing only himself and not his target.

Al-Asiri’s
 sinister creations have also been used on two high-profile terror 
attempts in the US, including the underwear bomb carried by Nigerian 
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300
 passengers over America on Christmas Day 2009.

In 2010, his devices were found in printer cartridges on a cargo plane bound for the US. They were intercepted in the UK.

In
 May 2012, US officials said they believed Al-Asiri had built an 
improved version of the underwear bomb, which was given to a 
Saudi-recruited double agent to blow up on a US-bound flight.

After
 the discovery of the printer cartridge bomb, then US deputy national 
security adviser John Brennan said analysis of the devices showed they 
were made by the same person who was behind the underwear bomb.

He
 said: ‘He’s a very dangerous individual – clearly somebody who has a 
fair amount of training and experience. We need to find him and bring 
him to justice as soon as we can.’

US
 congressman and former homeland security committee chairman Peter King 
said Al-Asiri was an ‘evil genius’, adding: ‘He is constantly expanding,
 he is constantly adjusting.’

Intelligence
 sources believe Al-Asiri, who is known as Abu Saleh, has been passing 
on his lethal bomb-making expertise from his base in Yemen to Syria, 
with plans to attack transatlantic flights.

He is also feared to be training British fanatics in Yemen, where MI6 and MI5 believe extremists pose a real threat to the UK.

All
 his bombs use a chemical fuse and a high-level industrial explosive 
known as PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate. The same material was 
used in 2001 by British shoe bomber Richard Reid when he tried to 
destroy a transatlantic flight.

Ben
 Friedman, a US expert in defence and homeland security, said the 
authorities were worried about bombs implanted inside people or 
explosives made from non-metallic elements.

But he said it was important to remember that previous attempts to blow up planes had failed.

‘These
 guys are serial failures,’ he added. ‘It’s not like they have a track 
record of unmitigated success. It’s closer to the opposite.’

They surfaced in Yemen in 2009, where it emerged they had joined the newly-formed Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

In August of that year, Abdullah pretended to be an Islamist militant who wanted to reform, and was given an audience with Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, Saudi Arabia’s top counter-terrorism official.

Once stood next to the royal, he detonated the bomb, hidden inside part of his intestine. But the blast went straight downwards meaning Abdullah was torn in two and the prince escaped with minor injuries.

Al-Asiri was named as one of Saudi Arabia’s most wanted terrorists in 2009 and in 2011 joined the US wanted list.
