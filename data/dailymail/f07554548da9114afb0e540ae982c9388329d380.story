A pair of American astronauts on the International Space Station were forced to shave their heads after losing a bet with a German crewmate over the two nations' World Cup game.

Caught up in the excitement over the success of the U.S. team, Nasa's Steve Swanson and Reid Wiseman agreed they would shave their heads if their team overcame Germany.

Alexander Gerst, from the European Space Agency, is already clean-shaven but faced painting the Stars and Stripes on his bald head should Germany lose their nerve in Thursday's game in Brazil.

Thanks to a Thomas Müller's 55-minute strike, Gerst broke out the space clippers - which are attached to a vacuum to stop stray hairs clogging up equipment in zero gravity - and sheared off his colleagues' hair.

Afterwards, Reid tweeted: 'It was nice to wake up this morning and not worry about my hair. There isn’t any.'

Wiseman, of Baltimore, Maryland, Swanson, of New York and Gerst, of Künzelsau, arrived at the space station on May 28 as part of the Expedition 40/41 crew.

They are scheduled to spend the next several months living and working in space until they return to Earth in November 2014.

On Tuesday the U.S. team faces the might of Belgium at the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador. Although figures have not yet been released, an estimated  24.7 million Americans watched.

Viewing parties were held at cities across the United States and New York's governor Andrew Cuomo gave state workers an extra hour of lunch so they could watch the game.
