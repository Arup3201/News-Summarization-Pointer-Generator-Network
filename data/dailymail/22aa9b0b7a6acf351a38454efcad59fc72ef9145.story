The bloodshed on Downing Street after David Cameron's extraordinary reshuffle today left Sky News' political editor so open-mouthed he swallowed a fly live on air.

Adam Boulton, 55, began gurgling and was then forced to stop speaking as he told how at least 13 ministers had lost their jobs or resigned.

But after three seconds of choking  the veteran broadcaster swallowed down the insect and described how the Prime Minister had sacked 'stale males' and many replaced with women.

Fly in the ointment: Sky News' political editor Adam Boulton began choking live on air today after a fly flew into his mouth as he described David Cameron's reshuffle

Down the hatch: After a few seconds the broadcaster looked revolted as he swallowed the insect, left, and after gasping for breath he continued with his piece

Sky presenter Dermot Murnaghan was so concerned he asked Mr Boulton whether he wanted to 'take a pause'.

But he responded: 'No no no I'm fine. I swallowed a fly but that's alright'. 

Later he joked the fly must have come from a nearby public toilet, tweeting: 'At 50p a time you'd think @CityWestminster could maintain their stinking Whitehall Public Loos'. 

The incident has already gone viral, with the Mail's political editor James Chapman calling it the 'undisputed highlight of the reshuffle so far', which was retweeted by Boulton himself. 

Professionalism: The Sky journalist smiled when he was asked if he was okay, and said: 'No no no I'm fine. I swallowed a fly but that's alright'

It is not the only extraordinary thing to happen while Mr Boulton has been broadcasting.

The veteran, who has been with Sky News since it started in 1989, had a legendary row with Tony Blair's spin doctor Alastair Campbell, which almost came to blows.

After the 2010 election Mr Boulton had asked him whether it was in the ‘national interest’ for Gordon Brown to spend four more years ‘limping on’ as Prime Minister.

Mr Campbell retorted that Mr Boulton was obviously ‘upset’ that David Cameron had not been elected Prime Minister.

An angry Mr Boulton then starting yelling: ‘I am not upset. I’m fed up with you telling me what I think'.
