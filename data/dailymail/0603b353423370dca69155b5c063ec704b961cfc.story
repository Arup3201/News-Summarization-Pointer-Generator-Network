She's one of the hottest new stars in Hollywood, who found herself firmly in the 'best dressed' Oscar lists after her appearance in a Saint Laurent dress and bold scarlet lips on the red carpet.

Now Margot Robbie, 24, who wowed on Sunday with her new on-trend long, has admitted that trying 'on a whole lot of nice clothes' is one of the best parts of her job.

In Focus, the Australian-born beauty wears a dazzling array of designer names including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Michael Kors and Givenchy  and she describes the film as 'like playing dress up'.

Margot says he lets the costume designers get on with their job and rarely offers her own suggestions; in one scene she shows off a Herve Lege halter neck bikini top (right) in the new film with Will Smith

She said: 'The costume choices are always pretty instrumental in creating your character so I was lucky that they were very open to any suggestions.

'Most of the time I just try to stay out of it or you end up dressing yourself and looking like yourself so it's better letting the people hired to do the job, do their job.'

Playing Jess, a pickpocket who joins up with seasoned conman Will Smith for a huge heist, the Australian actress had to portray a thief pretending to be a wealthy woman.

While many cinema-goers will catch the film to see if the chemistry between Margot and her co-star is as sizzling as rumoured, others will be captivated by her chic on-screen wardrobe, which is worth thousands. 

In one pool scene, she dons a sexy Herve Leger halter neck black strappy bikini, teamed with Prada platform sandals.

A body-con floral-print white dress by Trina Turk is in one scene shot in Argentina, while the over-sized shades are Gucci.

Margot also shows off her slim, toned physique in a red one-shoulder jersey dress by Roland Mouret along with Alexander Wang pumps. 

She said: 'The costume fittings for this were really fun because I got to wear cool clothes.

'The only input I had to my costuming was that I wanted there to be a difference between the first half and the second half of the movie looks for Jess.

At the start of the film, Jess's look is 'street, a little more edgy', said Margot, adding that she wears a 'leather jacket, nail polish that's kind of chipped, dark roots in her hair.

'In the second half, she's acquired more funds and wearing designer clothes. A little more form-fitted, geometric, sort of architecturally cool stylised looks.'

Along with a couple of Dolce & Gabbana items, she singled out 'some very fancy shoes' as memorable on-screen style moments.

Even in one early scene, when she's a scrappy thief, she's still dressed in expensive threads including a Helmut Lange white goat fur coat, Jimmy Choo ankle boots and a Givenchy knee-length skirt. 

The actress showed off a cool new hairdo and a stunning  Van Cleef & Arpels necklace, a plunge-front Saint Laurent, Seventies-style black gown and the final touch - stunning statement red lipstick

Recently hailed as the new Marilyn Monroe, ever-rising Hollywood star Margot Robbie felt it was safe to take the plunge and challenge the flattering comparison by wearing an anti-Monroe style gown at the 2105 Oscars.

The blonde bombshell, most notable for her voluptuous curves and her role in The Wolf of Wall Street, kept most of her enviable frame under wraps in a flowing black gown by Saint Laurent featuring sheer black sleeves and a draped plunging neckline.

Sultry in a subtle way, Margot went by the ‘less is more’ mantra and stayed classy for the annual event, although we would have quite liked to have seen her pour her curves into a scarlet corseted gown of some sort and ooze old Hollywood glamour. Her alluring demeanour remains intact nevertheless!

Margot hit the style spot anyhow (be it a safe bet)  and we love this gown because we can take some inspiration from it due to its timeless and wearable aesthetic.
