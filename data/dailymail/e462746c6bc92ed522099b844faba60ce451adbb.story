It is the kind of civilised al-fresco dining you’d normally associate with an upmarket French cafe.

But these BT Openreach workers in Savile Row defied expectations when, instead of eating a standard lunch of sandwiches with a cup of tea, they sat down to enjoy a hot meal and glass of red wine.

Every day Matt Bevan, 49, and Bob Lazarus, 58, who have worked together for the past eight years, will cook lunch from scratch using the little gas cooker in the back of their van.

Eating properly: The trio shun sandwiches and mugs of tea in favour of a sit down meal and a glass of red

This week they have been unfurling their gingham table cloths and laying out their plates, metal cutlery and wine glasses to enjoy what they describe as a ‘civilised lunch’ at Savile Row in Mayfair - famous for its posh tailors and bespoke suits.

The pair have a selection of herbs and spices at the ready and stop off at the market on the way to work to pick up fresh ingredients – rustling up anything from Italian pasta dishes to fish with vegetables.

And the sophistication doesn’t end there.

Mr Bevan, who has a fondness for anything retro and enjoys dancing, insists on playing 1920s music, jazz and classical throughout the day to create a ‘pleasant ambience’ and has decorated the van with quirky artefacts.

Dining in style: The three men have worked together for years and take it in turns to try out culinary creations on each other during their breaks

Making a meal of things: The trio like to eat in different places and enjoy 'putting a smile on people's faces'.

Mr Bevan, who works at different venues across London with Mr Lazarus in their job as BT engineers, said: ‘We spend most of our nine-hour day working underground so it makes us feel a bit more human to clean ourselves up before our lunch break and enjoy a proper meal.

‘After all it’s cheaper and fresher and we go back to the job with a clearer head. It’s just how we cook at home. My signature dish is chorizo pesto pasta with rocket salad and parmesan shavings.’

He added: ‘We both have an appreciation for the finer things in life. And passers-by always enjoy it too.’

This week's menu has included Thai green curry, washed down with red wine, and spaghetti bolognese with a baguette.

Sometimes the men enjoy a beer with lunch but, this week they decided to go with wine as one of them has a 'well-stocked wine cellar'.

The men have been repairing telephone lines in upmarket Savile Row but say they do not have a favourite spot to dine, having eaten their fresh roadside meals all over the capital.

Mr Bevan said: 'We like Soho because it has a great vibe and it’s the sort of place you’d go to eat out, but we like different places.

'We wouldn’t want to eat in the same place all the time because people would get used to seeing us. We enjoy putting a smile on people’s faces.'

Table for one: A passer-by can't believe his eyes when he notices the BT crew having lunch
