An Australian woman who reached down into her tummy and tearfully delivered her baby during a caesarean has encouraged women to consider the procedure. 

Kylie Szabo, 27, gave birth to baby Emma in a maternal-assisted caesarean at Dandenong Hospital, Victoria on January 15. 

The process follows the typical caesarean procedure, performed by surgeons. The major difference being the mother, wearing sterilised gloves, plucks the baby out herself.

'It was a beautiful, healing moment - after two emergency caesareans,' said Mrs Szabo, now a mother-of-three. She told Daily Mail Australia it made the caesarean feel 'natural'.

The rare procedure can bring humanity to an operation some women find dehumanising, although some obstetricians and midwives are cautious.

The key thing for hospital teams to consider is infection, said Associate Professor Steve Robson, the vice president of the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. 

Different hospital follow different protocols to ensure the mother is kept sterile. Mrs Wolfe wore two pairs of gloves to keep the second pair completely sterile. 

Ms Szabo followed strict sterilisation procedures. She was scrubbed up, wearing gloves and unable to move her hands. 

'I sort of understand very well where people say "this is something that adds an element of risk" and, "does it really add anything to the procedure,' Assoc. Prof Robson said. 

'Certainly some may feel its a great joy and benefit. 

'How does it play out in terms of risk to the woman? Nobody really knows. I suspect it's low but I can't prove that. 

'I think every other aspect (of birth) we're all so paranoid about making sure it's done as safely and minimise the risk of complications and infection.

Mr Robson said he would be happy to perform the procedure, although some obstetricians are more reticent to perform the procedure. 

It requires the buy-in of hospital staff, including those in the operating theatre, anaesthetists and hospital policymakers.

Midwifery expert professor Hannah Dahlen, from the University of Western Sydney, has seen one maternal-assisted caesarean over her long career but said several hospitals were open to performing them. 

'There would be lots of obstetricians unhappy with it happening. It also is a little bit more work for the midwives and everyone. (The patient) has to make sure her hands don't touch anything.' 

'Not all women want this. It's something that some women do,' ' said Prof Dahlen, who has delivered babies for more than 25 years.

'I think it certainly should be a choice.'

And now baby Violet: Mrs Wolfe then lifted her 11th child out. She told Daily Mail Australia on Thursday the twins will be her and husband Robert's last additions to the family

And women who have experienced maternal-assisted caesareans said it was a vast improvement on their previous procedures.

'My other caesareans were very sterile, very surgical, very impersonal,' Mrs Wolfe told Daily Mail Australia from her home on the Central Coast earlier this week. 

'People were talking about what they did on the weekend without even thinking about me laying on the table, going through this momentous experience of having a baby.' 

'This was much more personal.' 

Ms Szabo, who had no complications and was thrilled with the process, has no regrets about her choice. She told Daily Mail Australia it was an option women in her shoes should consider. 

'I'd probably say it was the closet thing I could possibly have to delivering naturally.' 

'I'd recommend anyone who'd like to try a caesarean as close as a natural birth as possible to highly consider it,' she said.
