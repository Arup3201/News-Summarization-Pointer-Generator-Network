This is the dramatic moment a herd of elephants rush to the rescue of a baby elephant trapped in a mud pool.

The youngster had become stuck in the tranquil watering hole along with a nyala antelope in Tembe Elephant Park, Southern Mozambique.

But the quiet atmosphere was shattered when the herd realises the baby elephant is stuck.

With a trumpeting of their trunks, the herd of elephants rush to rescue the trapped calf

The young elephants had earlier been playing around in the mud with their parents

Frantically trumpeting at full blast the herd en-masse dashes to help, desperately bundling the baby up and out of the mud pit.

The chaotic scenes were captured by Chris Vaughan-Jones, 21, during a leisurely 4x4 drive with two American tourists.

He said: 'We were at a quiet little water hole and there was absolute silence other than birds and grass hoppers There probably wasn't another human for 50km.

But as the seniors got out of the mud bath, the calves found the route out somewhat difficult

After a cry for help, ten elephants rush to rescue the calf, sadly trampling to death a nyala who was also there

Then the elephants all started trumpeting at full blast, which was a shock to suddenly have this tranquil water hole turned into a chaotic scene with 10 trumpeting elephants.

'I saw this situation panning out and knew something was going to happen, as the elephants hadn't become aware of the nyala until one of the babies actually flops its trunk onto it.

'We all felt very lucky to have seen this but at the same time scared.

'Seeing that we were about to go down and free the nyala just before the elephants arrived, we knew that could have been us being trampled to death.'

The elephants were forced to share their mud bath with a nyala, who wasn't fazed at first

But as the adult elephants rushed in to save their young, the nyala escape route was sadly blocked

Tragically the nyala was fatally trampled by the elephant herd as they tried to rescue their young.

Chris added: 'After a minute of awed silence that followed the chaos, while we watched the elephants, we all knew we had just seen something that not may people have ever seen.

'We knew the whole event only took one to two minutes and if we had either driven passed the water hole or had arrived a few minutes later we would have been non the wiser that anything had ever happened.

'We waited around for 15 minutes watching the elephants and in the hope the nyala would get up, but after a while we knew it was dead.'
