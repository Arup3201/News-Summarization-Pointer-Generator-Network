Jayde Pitt was so ill that she spent up to 18 hours a day vomiting in her bathroom

A schoolgirl crippled by a rare 
condition that saw her vomit up to 40 times a day was sick so often that
 doctors were convinced she was pregnant.

Jayde Pitt, 12, from Hereford, was so ill that she spent up to 18 hours a day vomiting in her bathroom.

Her illness is so rare that baffled doctors were concerned she could be pregnant or bulimic.

After months of sickness, Jayde’s mother, Leanne Rodrigues, was told that her daughter has a condition known as Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome, which causes sufferers to be regularly sick.

After weeks of tests Jayde was put on medication to control her condition, but can still be sick five or six times a day if she gets nervous.

Ms Rodrigues said: ‘It was awful to watch Jayde go through all this and not be able to help her in any way.

‘I was so worried about her and it didn’t matter how much I pleaded with doctors, they just couldn’t pin down what was wrong with her.

‘I have two younger daughters and I couldn’t be in the bathroom seeing to Jayde all the time as well as looking after her sisters.

‘We have since found out it is a 
notoriously difficult condition to diagnose and when Jayde first fell 
ill it felt like whichever way we turned we came to a dead end.’

It was only after appointments with five different doctors that Jayde was diagnosed with the rare condition.

Ms Rodrigues said: ‘It had got to the 
point where I felt like we would never get answers and seeing Jayde 
suffer was just horrible.

Jayde began constantly vomiting and writhing in pain with stomach cramps in September and after 48 hours of her constantly being sick, her mother Leanne became seriously worried

‘We tried so many different things to help stop her from being sick but there was nothing we could do.

‘She spent the majority of her days sitting in the bathroom just being sick repeatedly.’

CVS is characterised by recurrent, prolonged attacks of severe vomiting, nausea and lethargy, with no apparent cause.

It is thought there might be a genetic link.

Vomiting
 persists at frequent intervals, 5-6 times per hour at the peak, for 
periods ranging from hours to 10 days or more. It most commonly lasts 
for between 1 and 4 days.

Symptoms
 include: Severe and consistent nausea up to six times an hour, pallor, 
headaches and abdominal pain, lethargy and dizziness

The
 onset of CVS can occur at any time but most commonly develops between 
the age of 3-7 years and can persist for periods of time ranging from 
months to decades.

Jayde began constantly vomiting and writhing in pain with stomach cramps in September and after 48 hours of her constantly being sick, her mother became seriously worried.

‘I expected doctors to maybe say that it was just a virus not something as extreme as this.

‘As she hadn’t lost any weight they didn’t think it was an eating disorder and the only conclusion they could come to was she was either pregnant or making it up.

‘I was completely gobsmacked when they asked me if she could be pregnant.

‘Having to make her do the test I knew that it would come back negative but wanted to be able to prove it to the doctors.’

It was only when Jayde saw the 
paediatrician she had as a toddler that he recognised her symptoms as 
being CVS, and started her on a course of treatment.

After
 three months of constantly vomiting, Jayde is now only sick when she 
feels particularly nervous or anxious and can now live a more normal 
life.

After months of sickness, Jayde was diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome, which causes sufferers to be regularly sick

Ms Rodrigues, a self-employed saleswoman, said: ‘I am so pleased we have finally found a diagnosis and Jayde can almost live a normal life again.

‘As a mum it was heartbreaking watching her being so ill and being unable to do anything for her.

‘Now as long as she takes her medication and doesn’t worry about things we can have a relatively normal day.’

Dr Robin Dover, Chair of the Cyclical 
Vomiting Syndrome Association UK, said: ‘CVS affects people of any age. 
Although it used to be thought of as a disease of childhood, it can 
develop in adults too.

‘Periods
 of normal health are interspersed with bouts of intense debilitating 
nausea and vomiting. These attacks can last from one day to two weeks or
 more.

Jayde is now receiving treatment and is only sick when she feels particularly nervous or anxious

‘At its peak vomiting can occur six times an hour. It is the most severe vomiting condition in humans.

‘Relatively little is known about the causes and treatment can be difficult. Hospitalisation may be necessary and potent anti-emetic drugs may help reduce the symptoms.

‘Quality of life is usually severely impacted and education or work attendance can be badly affected.
