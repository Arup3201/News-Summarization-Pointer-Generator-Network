An Arizona man offered an undercover detective a year's worth of free haircuts, an iPad and iPod in return for killing his grandfather, police said.

Devin Almejo, 20, met the undercover cop in a grocery store parking lot Wednesday night after the cop responded to a Craigslist ad seeking a gun for the alleged planned murder of his grandfather.

Citing Almejo's inexperience with guns, the undercover cop reportedly offered to kill the relative for him; Almejo accepted the offer, police said.

Warning signs: Almejo made this disturbing posting on his Facebook page where he announced he had killed his grandfather

'We're talking about a homicide here. We're talking about murder.  This is serious.  Are you sure this is something you want to do?  Something you want to go through with?  Statements of that nature.. and each and every time, the suspect answers in the affirmative yes,' said  Detective Berry.

Before his arrest, Devin Matthew Almejo was given three chances to walk away from a meeting Wednesday night in a supermarket parking lot where the hit on his friend was discussed, but declined and 'answered that he was good with the murder,' police say.

Almejo was arrested and his grandfather, Michael, told Fox 10 that he was very surprised to hear what happened.

'We were getting along fine.  There was no problems at all.  The first I heard about this was last night.  This morning when the police came,' he said.

Almejo told police that the 'friend' abused him physically, mentally and emotionally.

Deal: Devin Almejo, 20, offered an undercover detective an iPad, iPod and year of free haircuts to kill his roommate Wednesday night

The paper identified the man as Michael Laide, a native of Australia who said he took in Alemjo to prevent him from life on the streets.

Laide said Almejo is mentally ill and a patient at a state mental-health provider.

Court documents released Thursday said
police found a disturbing post on Almejo’s Facebook account that hints 
at rage or fantasy.

Police found an image of a hand that appeared to be covered with blood, with red splatter on the ground 'the defendant had finally done it and had beat the victim repeatedly,' court papers said, according to the report.

The posting said that 'the defendant had finally done it and had beat the victim repeatedly,' the court document said, 'and could not get the victim to stop screaming.'

Laide told the paper he was warned by probation officers about trying to help Almejo, and said, 'The reality is that they were correct.
