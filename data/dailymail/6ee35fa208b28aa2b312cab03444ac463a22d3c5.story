Spectacular: the view from 26-28 Wolseley Road Point Piper, which went on sale earlier this week

Ray White Real Estate agent Elliott Placks says 'the view is pretty anomalous...there aren't many houses in the Eastern suburbs with unrestrained views of the harbour like that'

Ray White Real Estate agent Elliott Placks says the biggest distinctions is the proportions.  'The rooms are truly are impressive. They have high ceilings and a lot of grandeur.'

He says the size is another defining feature. 

'It's pretty uncommon to have a property on the harbour of this size' Placks says, referring to the 1300 sq meters of space on the property.

'It means buyers have the privilege of enjoying the property in all of its grandeur, or subdividing and creating a second residence.'

The house is fit with 6 bedrooms and bathrooms, a double lock-up garage and multiple living zones.

But perhaps the most alluring aspect is the design: think soaring ceilings, polished floorboards, extra wide corridors of palatial proportions. 

Placks says the house was built with predominantly Mediterranean influence.

'It's very Italian-esque. There large columns and big arches throughout the property which have a real classic appeal.'

'The view is also pretty anomalous. I mean, there aren't many houses in the Eastern suburbs with unrestrained views of the harbour like that. It's pretty special.'

The boat shed and in built boat ramp that come with the property. Mr Placks says this is an anomalous feature on the current market

The property was last sold for 25 million in 2007, and Placks says he expects a marked improvement from this price on account of the growth of the market.

A view of the garden: Point Piper is quickly earning a reputation of being a 'millionaires row', with five property sales over 30 million there in the tiny square kilometre suburb.

Another distinctive feature of the property are the vessel facilities.

'It comes with a boatshed and pre built boat ramp. I don't think you'll find many properties with that these days.'

The property was last sold for 25 million in 2007. Placks says he expects a marked improvement from this price on account of the growth of the market.

There are also signs from comparable properties in the same quarters, Placks says.

'106 Wolseley St recently sold for 30 million, and that's roughly an equivalent size to this property.'
