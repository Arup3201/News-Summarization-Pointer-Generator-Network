Jailed: Jeffrey Adams made £100,000 from shares which should have gone to Jeff Adams, a U.S. executive

A Tesco checkout manager who cashed £100,000 worth of shares meant for his executive namesake has been jailed for two years.

Jeffrey Adams was accidentally sent certificates which should have gone to a top U.S. businessman who shared his name.

Instead of being sent to the Chief Operating Officer of Tesco's Fresh and Easy business in America the 44,000 shares ended up in the hands of a shopfloor worker from Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire.

St Albans Crown Court heard that the blunder in 2002 was not discovered for seven years.

Adams received 13,326 shares in May 2002 and a further 31,094 two months later. He sold £57,000 of shares in April 2004 before pocketing a further £42,000 in June 2005.

When he was arrested in November 2009, the defendant claimed he had been given the shares in the will of his late grandfather Albert Booth.

Prosecutor Isabel Delamere told the judge: 'Jeff Adams was employed by Tesco as 
the Chief Operating Officers for the Fresh and Easy business in the US.

'He has a high-level executive career and as a senior manager 
participates in the Tesco Executive Share Scheme for senior managers.

'The defendant was employed in Burton on Trent as a check out manager and controller.'

Adams, who worked at a 24-hour store in St Peter's Bridge, Burton, used the money to buy a home with his second wife who is believed to work at the store.

The store only realised what had happened when the executive tried to sell the shares to purchase a property in California and discovered that they were not in his account with the firm Equiniti.

He was arrested by Hertfordshire Police because the supermarket's headquarters is in the county in Cheshunt.

The defendant was convicted of two counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception.

Defence barrister Anthony Rimmer said Jeffrey Adams was now on Job Seeker's Allowance and was being pursued through the courts by Tesco.

Mr Rimmer said the defendant had put his home was on the market and when sold he suspected it would be in negative equity.

'He is financially ruined,' he said.

He went on: 'The shares were credited as a result of error and he sat on them for some months. He gave way to temptation and convinced himself they were legitimately acquired.'

Mr Rimmer said Jeffrey Adams had not lived a lavish lifestyle and had two children from his first marriage and three step children.

Jailing him Judge Stephen Gullick said: 'You have to serve a prison sentence for £100,000 of dishonesty. You have shown no remorse and gave no plea of guilty.

'It was not a professional fraud. You took advantage of the situation. You saw an opportunity to make a good deal of money.'
