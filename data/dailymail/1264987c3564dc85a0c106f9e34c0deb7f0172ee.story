The meme that has offended parents at Pine Valley Middle School in California

The birds and the bees this was not.

Parents at a middle school in East County, San Diego, California, are up in arms after it emerged their children were given a sex-ed class laced with crude memes.

'That's something you can't unsee,' one parent, who asked not to be identified, told ABC15. 'This is definitely more than R-rated. This is X-rated.'

The X-rated presentation titled 'Top Conception Myths' was out on for pupils at Pine Valley Middle School.

Among
 other topics, it showed a picture of a group of young men with the 
caption 'douche bags' along with the information that douching does not 
wash sperm away after sex.

Another myth addressed with a meme: 'Girl on top can still get pregnant.'

But
 the one which shocked them most was a picture of a man with a bloody 
face accompanied by a caption saying, 'A real man loves his woman every 
day of the month.'

One parent said: 'This is horrific. This is unacceptable material.'

Another, who asked not to be identified,  told ABC15: 'That's something you can't unsee. This is definitely 
more than R-rated. This is X-rated.'

The school district said the 
presentation was produced by Mountain
 Empire Family Medicine, not a teacher.

In a
 statement issued to the channel, Mountain Health's CEO Judi Shaplin 
said: 'We understand and appreciate that some members of our community 
have voiced concern about a sex education presentation delivered by 
Mountain Health to Pine Valley Middle School.

'Our organization responded to a specific request by the Mountain Empire School District for this presentation.

'Mountain Health recognizes the 
sensitivity of such material and worked actively with the school 
district to assure that all information was pre-screened and approved 
prior to presentation.

'We work closely with schools in our region to help all community members stay informed on health issues.

'We are reviewing the content of the presentation with a special attention to the specific images that have concerned some parents.'
