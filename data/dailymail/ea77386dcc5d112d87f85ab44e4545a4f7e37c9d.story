A 'devious' mother has been jailed today for fleecing a leading Conservative out of nearly £100,000.

Jeremy Middleton, one of the Tyneside's most prominent entrepreneurs, was on David's Cameron's 'A List' of election candidates, served as the Tory party's deputy  chairman, and was made a CBE in this year's Queen's Birthday honours.

But behind his back, his 'trusted' finance chief Jacqueline Hayes was fleecing his bank account in 20 electronic raids after being given the 'keys to the safe'.

She was jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for two and a half years for her 'cunning and devious' thefts.

The court heard how Hayes was given her position within Middleton's Tyneside-based empire - but then plundered tens of thousands of pounds from behind Mr Middleton's back in a slick crime spree. 

Hayes, from Cullercoats, North Tyneside, helped herself to the cash in a series of more than 20 'electronic' raids on one of her boss' many accounts.

She chose the account deliberately because she knew it was the only one not checked by an outside auditor.

And after spiriting the money away, Hayes created a smokescreen of false entries to cover her tracks.

Jailing her for two-and-a-half years, Judge Roger Thorn QC told her: 'You were so greedy you may have surprised yourself with the amount you took.

'You were a highly valued employee effectively running the finances, and in part, the private life of the victim and his family.

'He was a multi-millionaire who you decided to soak.'

He added: 'Moreover, he was a public figure and my guess is you took a gamble that if you were found out it would all somehow be smoothed over.

'I have now seen how capable you are of being cunning and devious.'

Middleton was appointed a CBE in the 2012 Birthday Honours for political and charitable services - and made headlines in 2011 by moving into the house used for the Geordie Shore programme.

Hayes, a mother-of-two, told police she was innocent when she was arrested in April last year, and then she lied from the witness box during an aborted trial earlier this year, the court heard.

But only as a new trial was about to begin did Hayes finally admit five charges of theft, totalling £97,347, between August 2008 and July 2009.

Judge Thorn said: 'You sought to bluster your way out of this.

'You gave lying evidence and you cast aspersions on an employer who had been nothing but kind and supportive of you.'

Even after the 'gross' deceit he suffered at her hands, Mr Middleton 'bears no malice', the court heard.

And references, including one in person from another successful businessman, showed a different side to her character.

James Walker, mitigating said: 'She was a woman of good character.

'Clearly that has been shattered and given this conviction her further employment prospects have been devastated as well.

'She knows she made a dreadful mistake. She is extremely remorseful and it is clear she is absolutely petrified at the prospect of custody.'

Investigators will now seek to recover any of Hayes available assets under a Proceeds of Crime application.
