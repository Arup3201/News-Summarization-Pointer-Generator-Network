For £450,000 you would probably expect more than this in a property for your money - but, then again, we are talking about London.

A one-bedroom house in Denmark Hill, south-east London, is said to be the skinniest home in the capital - measuring just 99in wide.

The 466 sq ft two-storey house at the end of a three-storey terrace was built on a space that was once someone's side garden.

Tiny: A one-bedroom house in Denmark Hill, south-east London, is said to be the skinniest home in the capital - measuring just 99in wide

Narrow: While the living room is just about big enough to squeeze in a dining table and sofa underneath the stairs, the kitchen at the back is just 5ft 2in across

Outside: The agent said buyers would have to pay about £400,000 for a one-bedroom flat in the same area, but this property is a freehold and has a 75ft garden

Kitchen: The agent said that its location is excellent for commuters wanting a 'perfect pied-à-terre' because it is right across the road from Denmark Hill train station

The property is being marketed by 
sales manager Warren McCann of Foxtons in East Dulwich - who is 
confident of quickly getting it off the market.

He
 said that its location is excellent for commuters wanting a ‘perfect 
pied-à-terre’ because it is right across the road from Denmark Hill 
train station.

Mr McCann told the London Evening Standard: ‘I expect it was done by a developer who wanted to fit in an extra property at some point.’

He
 said buyers would have to pay about £400,000 for a one-bedroom flat in 
the same area, but this property is a freehold and has a 75ft garden.

Bedroom: Warren McCann of Foxtons in East Dulwich said the 'space is there, it is just not in a traditional layout'

Bathroom: The estate agents say that because of the property's location and the fact it has a garden 'it will go pretty quickly'

Interior: The dining area of the one-bedroom property (left). The floor-plan (right) appears to represent a corridor rather than a house, showing how narrow it really is

Up close: MailOnline reader Ramona Giorgetti took these pictures of The Wedge today. The property spreads to 22ft wide as it moves back from the road in Scotland

While the living room is just about big enough to squeeze in a dining table and sofa underneath the stairs, the kitchen at the back is just 5ft 2in across.

Mr McCann said: ‘The space is there, it is just not in a traditional layout. Given its location and the garden, I think it will go pretty quickly.’

The narrowest property in Britain is a terraced home on the Isle of Cumbrae off the Ayrshire coast in Scotland, which has a 37in front façade.

However the building - known as The Wedge - does spread to 22ft wide as it moves back from the road, which has an average property value of £63,000.
