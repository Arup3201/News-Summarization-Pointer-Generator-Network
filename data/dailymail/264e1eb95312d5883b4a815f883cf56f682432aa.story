An eight-year-old schoolboy who dressed as a character from Fifty Shades of Grey for World Book Day was laughed at by teachers, while a second school child was told he couldn't take part for wearing the same costume.

Cole Froom pulled on one of his father's suits and arrived at Lakes Primary School in Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire, dressed as Christian Grey - where staff found his costume 'funny'. 

However, in Manchester, Liam Scholes was 'excluded' from lessons after teachers at Sale High School branded his outfit, inspired by actor Jamie Dornan, was inappropriate. The 11-year-old pupil was dressed in a shiny grey suit, equipped with cable ties and a face mask.

But Cole's 28-year-old mother, Joanne Dickinson, was surprised when she heard Liam Scholes had been disciplined for the outfit, after her son's teacher reacted by laughing.

She said: 'I took him into the classroom and his teacher asked who he was and he said Christian Grey and the teacher just started laughing.

'Some of the kids had never heard of him so not many knew who he was dressed as but those who did thought it was funny'.

Miss Dickinson, who has an older daughter, Caitlyn, 10, and a 12-month-old baby called Harrison, said the Year 4 pupil came up with the outfit idea himself.

'He was asking on Wednesday about what he could go as for World Book Day. I'd done some researching and couldn't come up with anything.

'Then he suggested going as Christian Grey himself. He'd seen that I had the book and heard me go on about seeing the film.

'He hasn't read the book or seen the film but there are adverts on in the day and he's asked about it. But he thinks it's about a rich man that owns a big house and a helicopter.'

Cole asked his father, Stuart Froom, who is separated from Miss Dickinson, if he could borrow one of his suits.

After some persuasion the 35-year-old carer allowed him to wear his black shirt, grey tie and grey trousers.

'His dad popped in between his work hours with the outfit, but did say he didn't think it was a good idea, but we went ahead with it anyway.

'Most of the parents at the school thought it was funny. One or two have made little digs saying he shouldn't know what that is - but he doesn't know what it is.'

The full-time mother said she 'couldn't understand' why staff at Sale High School had taken such drastic action over the costume.

She said: 'I thought it went a bit far. I was half-expecting one of my son's teachers to pull me up on it today but they didn't.' 

Children around the country were encouraged to go to school dressed as literary characters on Thursday as part of the global event.

The Fifty Shades Of Grey novels by E L James series have sold more than 100million copies and tell the story of the relationship between a college student and a wealthy businessman.

They are notorious for their explicit scenes featuring sex acts and bondage, which some campaigners claim promotes domestic abuse.

Cole's experience was completely different to Liam Scholes from Sale High School in Manchester who also arrived in class dressed as Christian Grey from the novel. 

Teachers objected when the youngster appeared with cable ties and an eye mask which were both props from the controversial book. 

Staff then rang Liam's mother Nicola, who herself is a primary school teacher, to tell her that the outfit was inappropriate. 

She said: 'We thought it was funny. We were walking home from school and he had the idea of going as Christian Grey.

'At first we laughed it off but the we discussed it with a few friends and saw the funny side and decided it was quite a good costume idea.

'He went in a suit and shoes and with an eye mask and cable ties. The cable ties were tiny and not enough to do anything with them. We didn't think there would be a problem.

'I got a phone call home from the school saying the outfit was inappropriate and that he had been excluded from taking part or being in any of the photographs.'

Among the more traditional Oliver Twists, Burglar Bills and Where's Wallys, schools around Britain welcomed some more unusual 'literary' characters yesterday.

Jamie Peek, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, surprised his friends at Woods Loke primary by turning up as Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

His mother, Caroline, said: 'He's mad about cars and a massive Top Gear fan so he told me he wanted to go as Jeremy Clarkson.'

Mrs Peek added: 'It was a bit of a strange costume to pull together but I got a wig from eBay and trimmed it to look right. Most of the clothes are his own. He even impersonated Jeremy Clarkson's grumpy faced Twitter profile picture for the class photo.

'He's got a number of Top Gear annuals and books. I think it's good for his reading.'

Parents around the country were divided over whether superheroes more famous for films than books, such as Ironman and Spiderman, count as literary characters.

But the biggest debate on Twitter centred around the army of girls dressed up as Princess Elsa and Princess Anna from Disney's Frozen seen turning up at schools.

Benjamin Johncock tweeted: 'A little girl is dressed up as Elsa from Frozen. I want to shout at her, THAT’S NOT A BOOK'

Hundreds of girls around the UK arrived dressed as Princess Elsa from Frozen, though some parents questioned whether the Disney characters is truly literary

Claire Anderson added: 'My daughter is VERY unimpressed by the 23(!!) girls dressed up in Frozen costumes for #WorldBookDay at school'

A website user called saraurora added: 'The boy dressed as an oompa-loompa in a sea of Elsa's and superheroes is my idol'

Others insisted Frozen now has plenty of follow-up books based on the film and is an adapted version the classic Snow Queen tale.

Atticus Beaterband replied: 'Frozen is a riff on the Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen so technically it maybe could sneak in under the bar?'
