There was something quite striking when Joachim Low held up four fingers at Frankfurt airport on the way to the World Cup in Brazil.

Germany’s coach, targeting the country’s fourth title in Sunday’s final, either had balls of steel or he was one of the biggest bluffers in the game.

On Tuesday, we discovered that Germany are putting the finishing touches to a world-class team after beating Brazil 7-1 in stunning fashion.

Mastermind: Germany coach Joachim Low plotted stunning victory

Germany captain Philipp Lahm, along with Toni Kroos, Thomas Muller, Miroslav Klose and Andre Schurrle, were on fire in their remarkable semi-final victory in Belo Horizonte.

‘This is one of the strongest squads I’ve ever played in and we have two excellent players in each position,’ said Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker.

‘This all started with the youth academies developing well in the last five or six years.

‘It started off in 2009 when we won the Under 21 tournament and beat England 4-0, I think. That was a real turning point and five or six players from that team are doing well here.

‘There’s a small link between these two tournaments. That was five years ago, but overall you have to create a team spirit and with those magnificent players growing up together it makes it easier.’

This giant of a defender has been forced out of the team, a substitute during the destruction of Brazil after Low’s defensive reshuffle following the 2-1 victory over Algeria.

After that stodgy second round win in Porto Alegre, Mertesacker responded to criticism of the team’s performance by claiming they are ‘not some Mickey Mouse team’. Everybody is taking them seriously.

At some stage, probably when it is far too late, the wise men at the FA will look back at the fork in the road at the 2009 European Championship Under 21 final.

It was in the Malmo Free Stadium when England lost 4-0 in the final and they were not just beaten. They were destroyed.

Six players from that Under 21 team — goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, Mats Hummels, Benedikt Howedes, Sami Khedira, Mesut Ozil and Jerome Boateng — started the semi-final for Germany.

James Milner is the only player from that England batch to make it into Roy Hodgson’s squad for their disastrous World Cup campaign here.

Germany are different. They arrived at this tournament unbeaten in 15 games and their mission statement was to deliver the World Cup for the people back home. They have been waiting since 1990.

They are a powerful combination, moving the ball around the pitch with purpose and belief that they are better than the opposition.

‘Everyone is capable of playing and, as you could see, all of the players who came on were magnificent,’ added Mertesacker.

‘We’ve found the team spirit as well during the tournament and that makes the difference.’

Schurrle, the Chelsea forward who came off the bench to round off Germany’s victory with two magnificent goals on Tuesday, said: ‘The people back home are desperate for us to win. If you see the pictures, in every big city there are thousands, hundreds of thousands, watching every match.

‘They’re desperate. They want to see something. We want to give them something.’

On Sunday, inside the Maracana, they expect to deliver.
