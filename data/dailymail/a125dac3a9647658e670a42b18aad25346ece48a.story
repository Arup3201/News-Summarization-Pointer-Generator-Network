This was the disturbing moment a U.S. congressman grabbed and twisted a staffer's arm when the aide refused to let him into a room where a meeting was in progress.

Representative Don Young, a Republican from Alaska, faced down the young staffer who attempted to prevent him from getting into a House Republican meeting at the Capitol on Thursday. 

Young was caught on camera grabbing the staffer's wrist before appearing to twist his arm, in a clip posted by NBC News producer Frank Thorp V.

Young apologized today for his actions. In a statement to Politico, he said he was unaware of a rule that prevented him from returning mid-way through a meeting and that he didn't know  the staffer.

'Regardless, my reaction was wrong, and I should have never placed my hands on the young man,' he added.
