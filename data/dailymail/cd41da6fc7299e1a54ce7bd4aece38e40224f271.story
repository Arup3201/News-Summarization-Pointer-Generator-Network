For Celtic, the nature of this catastrophic Champions League defeat was bad enough. Yet they can take solace from one sobering fact: but for poor penalty taking and Fraser Forster they could, indeed should, have lost six.

Bluntly, this was as close to another Artmedia Bratislava as the Parkhead side have come.

Reduced to ten men by a red card for Efe Ambrose before half-time, the ten men kept the score down to four. Just.

Yet as 
things stand Ronny Deila’s side are all but out of the Champions League.
 The debate over a lack of investment in new players will now reach a 
deafening crescendo to eclipse the incessant din of an ecstatic Legia 
Warsaw support in the Pepsi Arena last night.

They
 will make optimistic noises. They will speak of overhauling this 
deficit and scoring three at their Murrayfield ‘home’. Yet the evidence 
they can do so while keeping the back door shut is scant.

After
 a risky team selection, Deila watched his team capitulate in alarming 
fashion here, losing two goals in the final six minutes on a night when 
Legia’s Ivica Vdoljak also missed two penalties – Forster saving the 
second.

The chances of Scotland’s champions reaching the group stages of the Champions League now look wafer thin.

They
 hauled back a 2-0 deficit to Shakhtar Karagandy last season, but with 
the excellent Miroslav Radovic in their ranks, Poland’s champions are a 
level above the Kazakhstan team.

On
 another catastrophic European night for Ambrose the Nigerian defended 
poorly for 44 minutes before recklessly chopping down Michal Kucharczyk 
on the edge of the area in a goalscoring position.

The
 decision by the Dutch referee Pol van Boekel to show a red card was 
correct. By then Celtic were already 2-1 down after the Legia dangerman 
Radovic ran the Parkhead side ragged with a double.

The
 loss of the Nigerian was a blow, but a mixed blessing after a hopeless 
performance. One which left the Scottish champions horribly and 
hopelessly exposed.Charlie Mulgrew – instrumental in landing Ambrose
 in trouble in the first place - moved into the centre of defence in the
 second half.

But
 the captain almost made things worse when he gifted Legia a penalty in 
58 minutes, a lazy leg allowing Ondrej Duda to crumple in the box.

Forster
 went one way and penalty taker Ivica Vdoljak went the other. Thankfully
 for Celtic the spot kick flew past the post. Forster would later guess 
right when the same player took a second penalty in the dying moments of
 this painful encounter to save further embarrassment.

How
 this night of humiliation transpired for Celtic is difficult to fathom.
 Like the boardroom spending policy, Deila’s team selection will 
certainly come in for sharp scrutiny in the coming days.

The
 Norwegian raised eyebrows by throwing new signing Jo Inge Berget in for
 a baptism of fire just 48 hours after joining the club on loan. The 
decision failed miserably.

After
 63 minutes he made way for Emilio Izaguirre, the left back left out to 
make way for right-back Adam Matthews. On a bewildering night nothing 
could fix this mess.

It
 started well enough. Callum McGregor putting Celtic ahead in seven 
minutes. McGregor scored the winning goal on his European debut in 
Reykjavik and followed that by smashing Celtic into the lead with strong
 echoes of the goal in Iceland.

The
 20-year-old received the ball from Teemu Pukki on the right flank and 
cut inside the left back Tomasz Brzyski keeping his composure to keep 
moving and smash a rising left-foot shot inside the left-hand post of 
Dusan Kuciak from 18 yards.

For Celtic it was a start they could barely have scripted. Yet the twist in the first-half tale was swift, brutal and suicidal.

Even
 when the visitors scored Legia’s support never let up. Their fervour 
was swiftly rewarded when their team levelled within three minutes 
through the lively and irrepressible Radovic.

Played
 in by Michal Zyro on the right of the area, the striker should have 
been closed down quickly by  Ambrose, but found time and space to strike
 an angled shot through Forster.

For
 Celtic the equaliser was unfortunate, but no disaster. In attack they 
carried a presence, Kris Commons almost striking the Scots back into the
 lead in 23 minutes with a clever twist and turn which ended in a shot 
over the bar.

Yet
 the main threat to Celtic’s hopes was self inflicted. Mikael Lustig 
almost gifted a goal in 31 minutes, a slack pass in his own area allowed
 Ondrej Duda a run on goal. It needed sharpness and pace from Virgil van
 Dijk – who had a fine game here - to get across and cover for the 
Swede.

But in 36 minutes Legia scored a second. Again, the defending from the team in green shirts was alarming.

A
 lofted cross to the back post picked out Kucharczyk, his header back 
across goal a meat and drink affair for Ambrose until the Nigerian 
slipped. Radovic could scarcely believe his luck as the ball dropped 
perfectly for a smash into the net from ten yards out.

There
 was misfortune in what happened to Ambrose, perhaps. But in common with
 other European nights – most notably against Juventus in the last 16 
and against Barcelona in a 6-1 defeat – he had a pretty dismal night 
here.

The
 misery of the World Cup defender was complete when he was red-carded 
before the interval, Mulgrew’s failure to control the ball in midfielder
 allowing Kucharczyk to nick in and slide the ball past the Nigerian as 
he lunged in late.

It was a red card, no question. One which left Celtic in an invidious and increasingly fraught situation.Beram
 Kayal’s arrival at half-time for Pukki was intended to shore things up.
 Yet Legia blew two wonderful chances to make it 3-1.

In
 53 minutes the excellent Radovic ghosted past van Dijk and played a 
brilliant backheel into the path of Zyro. The attacker seemed odds on to
 hammer a nail in Celtic’s coffin until Forster stuck out a knee to 
produce a superb and crucial save.

Five
 minutes later the onus fell on Forster again. He got nowhere near the 
Vdoljak penalty, guessing the wrong way. But when Celtic needed it most 
luck was on their side as the ball rolled past the post.If luck was on their side then, it was to be in short supply as the game progressed.

Playing
 their intricate, neat passing moves Legia looked liable to score at 
will. Somehow Celtic held firm until six minutes from time when Radovic 
turned Izaguirre inside, his penetrating cross picking out Zyro for a 
downward header into the corner of the net for 3-1.

It
 wasn’t over yet. Not for the first time in the match Forster kept 
Celtic in it – just - by diving to save a second Vdoljak penalty after 
Mulgrew tugged the substitute Kosecki back for a soft spot kick award.

As
 the board went up for full-time, however, the Englishman bore the look 
of a modern day King Canute. A swift, clinical Legia breakaway saw 
Lukasz Broz play a perfect ball across the face of an exposed backline 
for Kosecki to slot expertly into the net for 4-1.
