A father seems to be putting his daughters through the school of rock by dressing them up as iconic music stars and photographing them with a series of props.

Simon Murphy, 38, loves nothing more than giving his two girls, Biba, five, and four-year-old Lola, the rock star treatment by turning them into icons including Guns N' Roses star Axl Rose and Beatles legend John Lennon. 

The photographer and lecturer, from Glasgow, has even transformed the pair into Happy Mondays star Bez and guitar legend Jimi Hendrix using a range of props.

He is hoping to turn his music-loving daughters into more stars in the future alongside a separate project, dubbed 365, that aims to help his students find inspiration in everyday life.

He said: 'These images have been taken at home over the last couple of months.

'As a lecturer I feel it is important to lead my students by example.

'Some of my students complain that there is not enough time to complete projects or that they struggle for inspiration.'

Biba, five, rocks out as Guns N' Roses star Axl Rose and even dons an outfit strikingly similar to the ones he loved to wear

Lola gets into character as Jimi Hendrix wearing a paisley bandanna and floral shirt under a military jacket

Biba poses as Shane MacGowan from The Pogues, which her father says was a laugh because he loves them as a band and they had to use icing sugar to black out some of Biba's teeth

'Using Instagram, I decided to make a photograph every single day for a year to see if it was really such a difficult a task that I was giving them and also to make sure that I was sharpening my own photographic vision.

'I found that the more I forced myself to take images, the more I saw. On days where inspiration didn't come verily easily, I would set things up and as I love music I decided to get my kids involved, dressing them up as rock stars.

'I would stick the tunes on, show the children a picture of the rock star and we would make some photographs.

'It's just great to spend time being creative with the girls and introducing them to the music that I love - they are huge fans of the Happy Mondays now.'

The father-of-two said keeping his daughters in character was often difficult but admitted the series has so far proved to be a huge success.

Speaking about working with Biba, left, as John Lennon and Lola, right, as Jim Morrison, Simon said: 'It's just great to spend time being creative with the girls and introducing them to the music that I love'

He said: 'I love the attitude of the Liam Gallagher and Ian Brown pictures.

'I had to stick on the Jungle Book king of the swingers song to get that look from the girls.

'Also, the kids' attention spans might only last five minutes or so before they get bored so simplicity is definitely the key.

'Shane MacGowan from The Pogues was a laugh too - I love them as a band and we had to use icing sugar to black out some of Biba's teeth.

'The project is still ongoing - Sid Vicious, Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, ACDC and Led Zeppelin will all be featuring in the future.'
