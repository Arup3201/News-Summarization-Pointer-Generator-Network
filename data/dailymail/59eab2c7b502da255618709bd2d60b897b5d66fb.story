Ousted: Pastor Juan McFarland still has the keys to the Alabama church despite being voted out

An Alabama pastor made a sermon on Sunday despite being ousted by church leaders following revelations he was HIV positive, used illegal drugs, and misspent church funds.

Pastor Juan McFarland led Sunday morning's worship at Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Montgomery for a congregation of 50 who encouraged him during his sermon.

The Montgomery Advertiser reports that on Wednesday  retired Shiloh deacon Nathan Williams Jr. said McFarland admitted in a church sermon that he has been HIV positive since 2008 and even engaged in sexual acts with church members while knowingly having then disease.

Church members were surprised to see McFarland on Sunday after church leaders voted 80-2 to oust him from the church following news of his misdoings.

Only 50 members showed up on Sunday for a service that usually hosts about 160.

AL.com reports that Nathan Williams is suing to remove McFarland but that McFarland will stay in the pulpit for now.

McFarland has been Shiloh's pastor for 24 years and in Sunday's sermon referenced biblical stories that referenced the power of prayer and sudden healing.

He spoke about a story in the book of Matthew in which a faithful old man calls upon Jesus to heal his servant with leprosy.

'His servant was healed that same hour,' McFarland said. 'Jesus did it suddenly.'

A male in the congregation yelled out in support, 'Preach it, reverend!'

'Sometimes the worst times in our lives is when we have a midnight situation, and we are in a midnight situation,' McFarland told churchgoers.

'When you pray, you've got to forgive. You can't go down on your knees hating somebody, or wishing something bad will happen to somebody, he added.

McFarland told the story of Luke in which a woman pushes her way through the crowd to touch Jesus' garment and is then suddenly healed of her illness.

Shocking: McFarland, pictured delivering a sermon at the church earlier this year, revealed that he had taken cocaine while pastor, misused church funds for trips he didn't take and had sex with churchgoers

'Press your way through the crowd. Pass your way through the naysayers,' McFarland said.

The church's missionary president Annette Russell spoke to the congregation about McFarland's confessions and reminded them that they must have compassion.

'He's a man of God, but he's a human being,' she said of McFarland.

'It's not that we condone what our pastor has done, but we need to have compassion. We're not supposed to assassinate our brothers and sisters. We're not supposed to judge. We do our business at Shiloh. It didn't have to be expressed in the papers or on television.'

Julian McPhillips who is one of the lawyers representing the church has said that McFarland is having trouble facing the reality that he's been voted out of the church.

'He is a bit of a strong-willed guy,' said McPhillips, who on Friday met with major elders of the church.

'He's refusing to face the reality of what the congregation has voted.'

'He's trying to exercise dictatorial powers,' said McPhillips of McFarland. 

'He's living in a dream world.'

At the end of Sunday's sermon McFarland broke out in song singing The Lord is My Sovereign as crying members of the congregation embraced him. 

McFarland first revealed to worshipers in mid-September that he had contracted HIV in 2003 and was diagnosed with AIDS in 2008.

Whether or not he told all of his sexual partners that he had HIV or AIDS is yet to be determined, but one church-goer said she would be undergoing tests to see if she had the disease, WSFA reported.

'My heart goes out to her because she's been a wonderful church member, and then for something like this to happen,' the church member said. 'The fact that he didn't tell them at all. That's a crime in itself.'  

A former Shiloh deacon who heard his sermons told AL.com that McFarland is not taking medicine to treat his illness.

After his most recent sermons, deacons voted on October 5 to remove him as pastor. 

On the Sunday following the allegations,  Montgomery police were called after church members started fighting with each other but no one was removed.

Williams said he thinks police were called on people who had voted the pastor out. 

'Our moves are going to come directly from counsel. We want peace and we want to do things right, legally,' Williams said. 'We are not looking to hurt him. We are looking to get the church back.'

McFarland is also the Moderator with the Alabama Middle District Baptist Association, which includes 34 churches.

In a sermon in September, he revealed he had contracted HIV in 2003 and was diagnosed with AIDS in 2008 - and the congregation was supportive

But in later sermons he revealed he had taken cocaine, misused church funds and had sex with members of the congregation in the church

He knew he had AIDS at the time but it is not clear if he told all of the women he had the disease; at least one said she is getting checked
