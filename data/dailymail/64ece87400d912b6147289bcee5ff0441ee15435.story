There was an icy, some would say, ghostly welcome on the Welsh hillsides for a tourist on a short break to the Valleys.

For when holidaymaker Paul Feehan replayed the video from his holiday he was in for what he believes is the supernatural shock of his life.

During a break at his holiday caravan the property developer from Manchester deliberately picked an isolated quiet spot beside a manmade lake to relax and take it easy.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Spooky imagining: Paul relaxes on his holiday to Wales while the camera picks up what he believes to be a figure in the background

And as he took full advantage of the peace and quiet to sit and soak in the views of the stunning Welsh countryside near the village of Abersoch on the Lyn Peninsula he was filmed by a friend.

Even as the camera rolls there is no hint from either man that they have spotted anyone else near them.

Yet when Paul replayed the video he could clearly see a figure standing just a few feet behind him.

The figure, which Paul believes could be a ghost, can be seen at the back of the frame standing very still.

Lady in red circle: Paul is convinced that the figure captured on the video is wearing Welsh national costume and is female

Behind you! Paul's mystery figure appears more than once in the film shot while he was on holiday in Wales.

And it remains there for the duration of the short film as the camera pans left and right across the landscape.

Paul even believes that the ghostly spectre is female and is dressed in Welsh national costume.

He said: ‘This is really, really, weird. There was nobody else in the area at the time. When we walked down to the lake we saw nobody.

‘I am absolutely positive that the place was deserted at the time and I have no explanation for what you see on the video. It was completely deserted.

‘Knowing the lie of the land I think the figure could have been no more than 15 metres behind me.

'We heard nothing to suspect anybody else was near us.

‘When I saw it on the video I was shocked and did a bit of research on the internet.

'The outline with the hat and the type of dress looks exactly like a woman wearing Welsh folk dress.’
