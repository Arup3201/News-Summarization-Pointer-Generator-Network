Historic: The Rubicon passed into history after it was crossed by the army of Julius Caesar, pictured

The Rubicon has been one of the world's most famous rivers ever since Julius Caesar crossed it with his army in 49 BC and triggered a Roman civil war.

But despite its prominent place in history, no one is actually sure where the river is, with three waterways each suggested as a possible candidate for the ancient Rubicon.

Now the long-running historical battle is due to be settled for good, as three local historians present their cases at a mock trial in front of a judge.

It is not disputed that the river runs from the Apennine mountains down to the Adriatic sea in the Emilia-Romagna region in north-east Italy.

'Crossing the Rubicon' has been a metaphor for an important and irreversible decision ever since Caesar took his army over the river from Gaul, starting a war against Pompey which would leave him victorious and pave the way for the Roman Empire.

In recent years the phrase has been used by figures as diverse as David Cameron, who deployed it last year to warn of the dangers of Press regulation, and Mick Jagger, who sang it in the Rolling Stones' 2005 single Streets of Love.

However, the river itself lost its political importance in the reign of Emperor Augustus, who abolished its status as Italy's northern frontier, and for centuries it faded into relative obscurity.

Due to frequent flooding of the plains around the Rubicon, the river frequently changed its course and it became unclear which of three waterways it was.

Is this it? This bridge over the River Fiumicino is believed by some to have been the crossing used by Caesar

Renaissance historians considered the claims of the Pisciatello, Fiumicino and Uso rivers, and an ancient map called the Tabula Peutingeriana convinced many that the Fiumicino was the true Rubicon.

In 1933, fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who was intent on harnessing the country's Roman legacy to bolster his own power, made this judgment official, issuing a decree which changed the name of the Fiumicino to the Rubicone.

But on Saturday the debate start up 
again in the town of San Mauro Pascoli as three historians each press 
the case for their own local river, according to the Guardian.

Journalist
and former MP Giancarlo Mazzuca will insist that the question has 
already been answered, and that historians have long regarded the 
Fiumicino as the right answer.

'This
history is often overlooked due to the fact that the person who gave 
this order was Benito Mussolini,' he wrote in a preview for the event.

However, teacher Paolo Turroni will claim that the Pisciatello is the real Rubicon, pointing out that evidence from official maps and the works of the author Giovanni Boccaccio point towards it.

'There was no definitive proof,' he said. 'The debate, which had been going on for centuries, was still open. 'In reality, Mussolini had political reasons for doing what he did.'

The case for the Uso will be presented by archaeologist Cristina Ravara Montebelli, who plans to rely on the presence of Roman ruins in the area as proof.

The debate will be judge by Gianfranco Miro Gori, president of the local business association, who insists that the fiery arguments are all good-natured and have never undermined relations between neighbours.
