More than four years after Wael Ali’s identical twin brother Wasel was found strangled in back woods the brothers played in as children, Wael was charged with first-degree murder.

Accused of killing his then 19-year-old brother in Columbia, Maryland, prosecutors said that because of the twin’s shared DNA, no DNA evidence was found at the crime scene or finger prints collected. The murder weapon was only a pair of hands.

But police said there were at least 25 minutes before Wasel’s death that Wael was unaccounted for as well as changing statements on where he told authorities he had been.

Slain: More than four years after the murder of 19-year-old Wasel Ali, his identical twin brother Wael, both pictured together, has been released on a charge of first-degree murder

'I am so done with you,' prosecutors 
accused Wael of threatening his brother after one of their increasing number
of fights just before Wasel’s death in August of 2007, reports the Washington 
Post.

It followed a series of shared trouble with the law including twice impersonating police officers as well as shop lifting.

'I'm sick of getting in trouble because of you. Wait till we get home,’ prosecutors claim Wael told Wasel after their arrest in August of 2007 when caught impersonating police officers after enrolling in the army out of high school.

It was their second arrest on such a crime, with both brothers accused of stealing an Army sedan from Fort Meade months earlier to chase a speeding vehicle.

Wearing military batons and pepper spray on their belts, the two wrongfully identified themselves as military police officers to police dispatch.

That identification served them with probation after charged with stealing a government vehicle, impersonating a police officer and being in possession of a dangerous weapon.

'We just made some wrong decisions,' Wael told the Washington Post. 'We got mesmerized by the whole being in uniform thing and being in the Army.'

Everything together: With the brother's high school graduation they both enrolled in the Army hoping to go into a career as military police officers

Defense: The brothers admitted to getting into fights with one another from time to time, increasingly more before Wasel's death noted prosecutors, but Wael said he never killed him

Both left the Army and moved in with their parents getting jobs at the mall: Wasel at Banana Republic and Wael selling cell phones. But they hadn’t lost their passion for law enforcement, leading to that second arrest in 2007.

A search of their car after that arrest found an unloaded .45-caliber pistol the twins would tell police had been stolen.

It was days later on August 22 of 2007 that their home, and then world, would be turned upside down.

Bursting through their parents' doors, hand cuffing both brothers and their father outside their townhouse, a Howard SWAT team raided their property looking for additional illegal weapons.

While their raid was unsuccessful, prosecutors said Wael’s embarrassment for his father and the failure they had found themselves in with the law, led to his increasing anger toward his brother.

‘There were a number of stressful situations on August 22, 2007, the day that we believe this young man was killed,’ Sherry Llewellyn, a spokeswoman for the Howard County Police Department told ABC2. ‘We can't say for sure what led up to the murder, but we do know that those things took place’

Police said Wael admitted both getting in a fist fight in their home that day following, with their father told to regardless drive to the mall in the family minivan later where Wasel had been called into work and needed a ride home.

Wasel had been accused of shoplifting and in his admittance to the crime he dually implicated his brother in the theft, according to police.

Prosecutors worked to prove that Wasel’s 
allegations of theft against his brother tipped him over the edge when 
he met up with him that night.

When Wael’s father sent him to pick his brother up from the mall, Wasel never returned with him.

Wasel's body was found in the woods five days later by a hiker, a victim of strangulation.

His black suit jacket was pulled over his shoulders, his arms pinned behind his back.

'We don’t have DNA at the crime scene 
because with twins, they share DNA,' said prosecutor Doug Nelson who 
accused Wael in the crime. 'There’s no fingerprints on the murder 
weapon. There’s no murder weapon.'

Authorities accused Wael of changing his story on what he did after captured entering the mall parking lot on surveillance camera, meeting his brother and some friends inside, and then the two brothers exiting through different doors.

'They're seen on the video together, and then leaving the mall separately. Then our suspect's time is unaccounted for, for a period of time in which we believe he committed the murder,' Ms Llewellyn said.

Wael's defense said he waited for his brother in the mall's parking lot where they planned before leaving on his own.

They said he did not kill his brother.

'There is no motive present for Wael to kill his twin brother, his best friend, and his flesh and blood,' attorney David Zwanetz said in his opening statement.

With the case going cold, Wael was released.

Charged: Wael is seen after his arrest on September 15 of 2011 on charges of first-degree murder, four years after his brother's death

In 2009, hoping to move on with his life, Wael moved to the Atlanta area with his mother and sister, enrolling at American Intercontinental University Atlanta for criminology.

One year later, Wasel's cold case was assigned to a new investigator, Nick DeCarlo of Howard.

Agreeing to meet with Mr DeCarlo during a visit home in August of 2010, the two sat in an interrogation room with a tape recording their conversation.

'You don’t know what it’s like to lose a twin brother,' Wael is heard telling Mr DeCarlo in the tape that would be later played before a jury. 'Please do not insult me and come at me as a suspect. I have been through Hell and back ... There is no reason why I want my brother’s killer to just be out there walking the streets.'

Mr DeCarlo replies: 'Neither do I.'

'Two brothers. You have a fight. You have some issues. You are going to resolve the issue as brothers often do, with fists or whatever, and unfortunately Wasel got hurt and he died,' Mr DeCarlo accused.

'We did not fight ... my brother and I did not fight that day,' Wael retorted.

Despite his claims on September  15 of 2011 he called his father from a Cobb County Jail informing him: ‘I’ve been arrested for first-degree murder.’

‘I just see, like, flashlights at my back door and hear police radio chatter. They just coming, rushing in, like, 20, 25 of them,’ he described of that night to CBS. ‘I told him three times. I think he asked me in the interview had I killed my brother and I said no.’

Celebration: With charges dropped Wael Ali is seen celebrating with family at his release and return home in Maryland last May after a seven-month jail stint

Held for seven months behind bars, during the final verdict, a jury deliberated for 20 hours before ruling a mistrial.

No direct evidence or DNA evidence could prove Wael guilty the court found.

One month later in Howard County prosecutors dropped charges against Wael.

Prosecutors told a judge that they will not pursue another trial for Wael Ali, 24, after a mistrial was declared.

‘It was great being able to kiss and hug my mom again,’ Wael told WJZ after his release. ‘To know I’m free and that this is over. We’ll never know [what happened to Wasel]. It’s unsolved.’

Assistant State’s Attorney Jim Dietrich says after speaking to jurors, prosecutors didn’t think they could do better in a retrial of the circumstantial case.

Howard police say the case remains open, and in a statement released in April, reminded of Wael being a main suspect.

‘The investigation to date has continued to lead detectives to the victim’s brother as the main suspect. We will continue to investigate the case, and if additional leads are discovered, we will review with the state’s attorney’s office,’ they wrote.
