It's not every day that you find yourself sitting in the front row while a scantily clad dancer writhes in front of you but that is exactly what happened to the Netherlands' Queen Maxima last night.

The 43-year-old royal did, however, manage to keep a straight face during the modern dance performance which took place at Copenhagen's Royal Library.

Sat beside Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik, who also managed to look suitably interested, the royal was enjoying the second evening of a three-day state visit to Denmark.

Sharing a joke: Maxima and Frederik (far right) share a joke during the modern dance performance

As the performance by Dutch dancers from the Het International Choreographic Arts Centre wore on, the two couldn't resist sharing a joke  while Denmark's Prince Consort Henrik looked decidedly nonplussed.

They had flown over especially for the performance which was part of a return banquet hosted by Queen Maxima and King Willem-Alexander for the Danish Royal Family.

Designed to highlight Dutch culture, Maxima arrived for the event looking wonderful in a patriotic russet gown studded with rhinestones.

Eschewing her usual up-do, the mother-of-three wore her long blonde hair loose and curled for the event, which was designed to give Denmark and its royals a sneak peek at Dutch culture. 

Sitting on her other side during the performance was Willem-Alexander, who, like 46-year-old Frederik, was dapper in a dinner jacket.

Nonplussed: Not everyone appeared to be enjoying themselves with some of the audience looking baffled

Scantily clad: Most of the dancers chose to keep clothes to a minimum for the event

Round of applause: The royals, among them Queen Margrethe, politely clapped when the performance ended

Well done: The dancers enjoy the adulation at the end of their performance

Not to be outdone, 43-year-old Crown Princess Mary opted for a striking strapless black dress with a flattering empire-line cut.

In contrast to her Dutch counterpart, the Australian-born royal had pulled her hair into a sleek low chignon and wore eye-catching diamond-shaped gold earrings.

Equally glamorous was Denmark's Queen Margrethe who donned a rose-pink gown with a white lace bodice and fur shrug.

Also at the event was Margrethe's younger son, Prince Joachim, 45, and his impeccably dressed French wife Marie, 39, who swept Maxima an impressively low curtsey as she arrived.

The cultural celebration topped off a busy day for Maxima and Willem-Alexander who had earlier experienced the best of Danish weather during a sunny but  blustery ferry crossing to Samsø island.

A small speck of land just off Denmark's Jutland Peninsula, the island is entirely carbon-neutral with heat and hot water produced by incinerating hay.

Afterwards, the royal party was shown around a special type of Danish boarding school called an efterskole.

Most Danish teenagers spend at least a year at the boarding schools, which are usually paid for by parents, albeit helped by a contribution from the state, where they are encouraged to focus on specific interests such as music.

The efterskole on Samsø focuses on aquatic sports, diving, aviation and golf, all of which are frequently indulged in by the sports-mad Crown Prince.

Willem-Alexander and Maxima's trip to Samsø was one of the main events of their three-day visit, which began with their arrival at Kastrup Airport's royal terminal on Tuesday.

The pair were treated to a banquet at Christiansborg Palace that night, with Maxima wowing in a spectacular royal blue lace dress.

Denmark's Queen Margrethe also rose to the occasion in pale blue, while Crown Princess Mary chose simple white. 

Last night's cultural event was the last stop on an action-packed itinerary that ends today when the Dutch royal couple fly home to Amsterdam.

Close: The two couples, who are of a similar age, are known to be close friends

Hats off to Mary and Maxima! The Dutch and Danish royals were glamorous in matching trilbies
