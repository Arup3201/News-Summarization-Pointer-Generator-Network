London student Nawaal Msaad, 27, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey today, is accused of trying to smuggle cash to Syrian jihadists for 1,000 euros

A student accused of trying to smuggle cash in her underwear to give to a British terrorist allegedly fighting in Syria exclaimed ‘whaaay’ when told she would be paid 1,000 euros, the Old Bailey heard today.

Human resources undergraduate Nawal Msaad, 27, was allegedly recruited by her friend Amal El-Wahabi to take the money to her Muslim convert husband Aine Davis.

But she was arrested by counter terrorism officers on January 16 this year as she tried to board a flight from Heathrow to Istanbul in Turkey.

The court was told that Msaad, from Barnsbury, North London, then pulled out a large wad of notes, which had been tightly wrapped in cling film, from her underwear.

Jurors heard Msaad was only asked if she would be a cash mule three days beforehand.

Messages exchanged by the friends on mobile phone service WhatsApp were read out in court.

On January 13, mother-of-two El-Wahabi wrote to Msaad to arrange the alleged deal: 'Hay (sic) babes r u about this week do u want to do a job.'

The Met University student Msaad replied: 'Hey honey, I’m up to my neck in Uni work. What’s it for?'

El-Wahabi continued: 'I will call u l8r to explain, u have to go away for 2 days n get paid a grand bt in euros n everything is covered for u.'

To which Msaad replied: 'Whaaay.'

In further messages El-Wahabi tells her: 'I can’t do it as I have da kids and I’m looking after my brother. So u will do it. It has 2 b done dis week asap. I ask u cuz I trust u.'

She then sent a message to her husband, who is believed to have fled the country to pursue the jihadist cause, saying: 'Think I have sum 1.'

Msaad then asked: 'What’s this about?' and El-Wahabi replies: 'Can’t explain on dis.'

Phone records show the pair exchanged a number of phone calls, the content of which is unknown.

But prosecutors claim they were making arrangements to smuggle the cash to Syria.

While exchanging messages with Msaad, El-Wahabi messaged her sister Hana El-Wahabi about getting her hair done and eating burgers and chips.

At one point she hinted she was going to ask her sister to do it saying: 'Had a job for u to get a grand n 3 holiday bt u cant ur wrking.'

She also wrote to her husband Davis, who now goes by the name Hamza, asking if she can send him ‘explicit pics’ of herself.

She wrote: 'Can I send u some photos (explicit) up 2 u miss dressing up for u can c my new hair cut n colour.'

Internet records show Msaad googled ‘cheap flights to Istanbul,’ ‘cheap flights to Istanbul Ryanair’ and ‘easyjet Istanbul.’

On January 16, Msaad set off to Heathrow but was met at the departure gates by officers and asked why she was travelling to Turkey.

She said she was going on a 'short break' and was going to buy some gold for her mother.

El-Wahabi, 27, was arrested later the same day at an address in north west London.

The women, who are both British, are on trial accused of fundind terrorism. They deny the charge.

The trial, which is expected to last five weeks, continues.
