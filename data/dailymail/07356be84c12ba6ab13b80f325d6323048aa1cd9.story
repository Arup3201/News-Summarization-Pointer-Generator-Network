Despite claims that they are boozy or culturally ignorant abroad, British holidaymakers are now more adventurous than ever when it comes to local history and cuisine, new research suggests.

A survey of UK tourists found that three-quarters of those polled are keen to learn 15 phrases in a foreign language while they’re abroad, and the average Briton wants to try six new local dishes or drinks.

Homestay.com said its study reveals the typical British tourist is now more of a culture vulture than holiday resort recluse.

The study by Homestay.com said the average Briton wants to try six new local dishes or drinks

Forty per cent of respondents said they want to learn about local customs and residents in the countries they are visiting this year.

Just 14 per cent (or one in 10) said they would rather befriend fellow Briton during their getaway.

More than two-thirds agreed it is important to learn about local culture whilst away, with the average Briton wanting to visit five local attractions.

The study also found that 70 per cent want to head back to the UK with a better understanding of the country or countries they have visited.

Staple British holiday meals such as fish and chips are also being turned down in favour of local cuisine.

Of nearly 2,000 British adults who were polled, just nine per cent want to stay poolside to work on their tan, compared to 40 per cent who aren’t bothered about bronzing.

The average summer holiday will last 10 days and tourists are planning to spend 20 per cent more on their getaway.

Alan Clarke, CEO for Homestay.com, an online marketplace for hosted homestay accommodation, said: ‘The research clearly shows how much our priorities have changed when it comes to our summer holidays.

‘Millions of Brits now want to explore the country they’re visiting and really learn about their destination, as opposed to just lounging by the pool and topping up their tans.’

Homestay.com’s survey seems to support the findings of the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), which found that consumers are looking to spend more on their holidays in 2015.

An ABTA survey found that 35% of Britons think they will visit a new country (pictured: Vilnius, Lithuania)

The ABTA survey determined that 20 per cent of British holidaymakers anticipate spending more on holidays this year, compared to 15 per cent who say they will spend less.

Of those polled, many are looking for new experiences, with nearly half (48 per cent) saying they are ‘quite likely’ or ‘practically certain’ to visit a new resort or city.

A further 35 per cent said they think they will visit a country they have never visited before. 

It may come as no surprise that younger holidaymakers are the most eager to try new destinations, with half of 16-24 year olds (49 per cent) saying it is ‘quite likely’ and a further 16 per cent saying they are certain they will visit a new destination. 

Older consumers, meanwhile, prefer to return to familiar surroundings.

More than half (56 per cent) of over 65s polled by ABTA and half of 55-64 year olds said they would definitely not or would be unlikely to visit a country they had never been to.
