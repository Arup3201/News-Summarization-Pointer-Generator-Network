Now THAT's handy! Looking for the perfect Christmas gift for a beauty buff? How about Charlotte Tilbury's new The Supermodel Genius Tutorial Box - a new beauty box packed with celebrity-loved make-up and a built-in video tutorial showing you how to apply it

The talking video box has been designed to combine the vintage style of a jewellery box and the technological ease of an iPad, so that beauty buffs can watch, learn and apply make-up simply by opening the lid.

As you open the box, a video of Charlotte applying the make-up on a model along with a step-by-step guide begins playing.

The box is also packed with items from Charlotte's make-up collection to help beauty aficionados create The Supermodel look; a look inspired by all the supermodels that she has worked with.

Writing about the look on her website, Charlotte said: 'Inspired by the heavenly supermodels of the 1990's and the trailblazing icons of today’s catwalk, from Linda, Cindy, Claudia, Helena and Naomi, to Kate, Cara, Jourdan, Joan and Miranda. 

'The Supermodel is channelling the legendary make-up of these perfect, glamazon women who understand the power of the ultimate smoky eye paired with a sultry nude lip look.'

Industry heavyweight: As well as working backstage at the most esteemed fashion shows, Charlotte is credited with transforming the likes of Millie Mackintosh, Suki Waterhouse and Margot Robbie

Famous fans: Charlotte has recently worked with Jennifer Aniston, left, and did Kate Moss' make-up for her Topshop launch earlier this year

As well as working backstage at the most esteemed fashion shows, Charlotte is credited with transforming the likes of Millie Mackintosh, Suki Waterhouse and Margot Robbie. Poppy Delevingne even called on her to do her bridal make-up for her wedding earlier this year.

So it's fair to say that Charlotte knows a thing or two about beauty. It is perhaps then little surprise that A-lister Kim Kardashian, 33, known for her love of dazzling red carpet looks, called on the make-up maestro to give her a Brit girl makeover when she landed in London recently. 

However, looking like an A-lister doesn't come cheap; Charlotte's box will set you back £200. One for the Christmas wish list?
