There was always something a bit ridiculous about FIFA banning Luis Suarez from ‘all-football-related activity’. It was a bit like a school headmaster dishing out a month’s worth of detentions to an unruly pupil and then adding: ‘And you have to go to bed early every night with no dinner’. They were out of their element; ruling beyond their area of jurisdiction.

Barcelona pay Luis Suarez’ wages if they want him clocking in at 9.30 sharp for training at their Joan Gamper training complex who is Sepp Blatter to tell them that can’t happen. What FIFA do about a player’s participation in their competitions, however, is another matter and it is no great surprise that the Court of Arbitration in Sport (CAS) have not over-ruled them on that part of the ban.

Although both Suarez and Barcelona were hoping for more, CAS has limited itself to reigning-in the game’s governing body, rather than meddle in the number of matches it felt fitted the crime.

Ruling: Luis Suarez's camp were hoping that the length of the ban would have been reduced

As to the question: are nine missed matches for Uruguay and 11 for Barcelona excessive? There are two ways of looking at the ban. One is that after a third offence of the same nature, an exemplary punishment was inevitable. The other is that in view of the three-match ban given to Zinedine Zidane for poleaxing Marco Materazzi with a headbutt to the sternum in the 2006 World Cup final, 20 games is a disproportionate penalty and more a reflection on who was offending, rather than the offence itself.

Suarez’ legal team took such an argument to Lausanne with them as well as the apparent contradiction inherent in such a lengthy ban being given for a bite which did not prevent Georgio Chiellini from finishing the match, and the decision to take no action against Blaise Matuidi’s leg-breaking challenge on Ogeny Onazi or Juan Zuniga’s assault on Neymar that also broke a bone.

CAS has chosen not to involve itself in the debate over whether punishment should reflect the victim’s time out of the game. Instead they have just fairly and squarely pushed FIFA back over the line it had crossed. In view of the fact that they have limited themselves to changing the details of the ban and not its length the only surprise is perhaps that it took them a week to do so.

Incident: Luis Suarez bite's Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup match

The timing of their decision does mean that Suarez can play Barcelona’s last pre-season friendly against Mexican club FC Léon de Guanjuato on Monday and be presented to supporters.

The lifting of the ban on non-official matches means he can also play for Uruguay in forthcoming friendlies against Japan and Korea although the fact that he definitely misses the Copa America, to be played in Chile next year, will perhaps make his involvement in those games unlikely.

The Suarez camp had high hopes on Thursday morning but there was also an expectation that getting any FIFA ruling over-turned was going to be impossible. Suarez can at least start feeling like a footballer again. He does not have to go running in the Pyrenees or in disguise along the beach of his new home on the Costa Brava.

Bite: Suarez was not even booked after the incident, but was later handed a four-month ban

Marks: Chiellini attempted to show the referee the bite marks on his shoulder, but to no avail

And he can now begin training alongside Leo Messi and Neymar – the trio Barcelona hope will put them back in the trophies after last season’s failings.

The club can arrange as many trial matches as possible to make sure he is as fit as possible for October 25 when his ban ends, and for the following day when Real Madrid will be the rivals in his long-awaited debut.

Those who want him locked up and the key thrown away will rejoice that the matches-ban stands. Those who know him off the field will hope when he comes back he can finally overcome the unpleasant, bizarre, and ultimately only self-destructive trait that currently means he starts every season at least a month after everyone else.
