Have you ever wondered what you would look like if you were a little skinnier or your nose were a little straighter? For one photographer, wondering wasn't enough.

Scott Chasserot has created images that explore what ordinary people would look like as their 'ideal self.'

The photographer wanted to investigate our subconscious beauty ideals in order to display the gap between how we look and how we long to look.

The project, Original Ideal combines portrait photography with neuroscience combining psychology, brain scans and photo shop.

Scott begins by taking a portrait image of each subject. He told Buzzfeed that he looks for models who are  'facially very interesting. Or that have interesting stories. A few people on are transgender.'

The alterations vary from a change in eye size to skin tone 

The subjects are presented their alternative images while attached to a brain scanner 

After taking the original image, Scott creates 50 more portraits by making small adjustments using Photoshop, altering anything from the size of their eyes to the tone of their skin.  .

The subject is presented with the various versions while attached to a brain scanner which records their reactions in order to determine the version they prefer.

Some of the changes to the images were barely noticeable but in other cases the subject's ideal appearance was unrecognisable to their first image

When selecting his models Scott opted for those that he described as 'visually interesting'

Once Scott has uncovered which of the images the subject has the most positive reaction to he displays it next to the original image, showcasing the contrast between the original image and the model's ideal.

In some of the photographs the change is barely discernible, with the smallest of tweaks - such as a slight re-positioning of the eyes - needed to make the subject satisfied with their appearance.

However, in some cases the second portrait is completely different to the first, with a change in eye colour and size seeming to make the most noticeable change in overall appearance.

Several of Scott's subjects were transgender, however their identities have been kept secret

The most stark contrasts appeared when the second image saw a change in eye colour and size

Scott believes that even from a young age we still have an idea of what we would prefer to look like

For this subject a change as subtle as an extended forehead was all that he sees as an improvement to himself

The photographer alters the original image 50 times on Photoshop and then uses a brain-scanner to measure which image the subject reacts most positively to

In this case the woman would prefer larger eyes and fuller lips
