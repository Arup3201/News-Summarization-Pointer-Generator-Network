Death: Isobel Reilly died at a party where she found drugs in flat belonging to Brian Dodgeon and Angela Hadjipateras, who were 70 miles away

A coroner today blamed a lecturer and his partner for the death of a 15-year-old schoolgirl who took an ecstasy overdose at an unsupervised party at their home.

Isobel Reilly collapsed in a shaking fit and foamed at the mouth after taking two high-purity ecstasy pills and powder she had found stashed in a bedroom closet.

The teenager, already in trouble for cannabis use, begged friends not to call 999, and when paramedics were finally summoned it was too late to save her.

Coroner Fiona Wilcox said lecturer Brian Dodgeon and his partner Angela Hadjipateras were guilty of serious failures for leaving Isobel and her friends alone at their house, in Kensington, west London, while they went to another party, 70 miles away in Hastings.

She issued a damning narrative verdict after hearing Dodgeon, 62, a self-confessed ‘old hippy’, had kept ecstasy, MDMA, ketamine, and LSD unsecured in the house for years.

Despite teenagers getting drunk and smoking cannabis at previous parties at his home, Dodgeon claimed he never considered someone may hunt out his drugs stash.

‘I find if the party had been supervised by Angela and Brian, as they had done for all previous parties, even if they had just come home around midnight or just after, Isobel would not have died’, said Dr Wilcox, at Westminster Coroners Court.

‘She would not have taken ecstasy tablets that ultimately took her life.’

The couple knew Isobel and a group of teenage friends would be partying at their home when they left for the night, on April 22, 2011.

They only made a last minute phone call to a neighbour, asking her to be ‘on call’ for a small gathering at their house.

But the coroner found serious failures by Dodgeon and Hadjipateras, but rejected a verdict of negligence or unlawful killing because she judged their failure to supervise the party or secure Dodgeon’s drugs had not been ‘gross’.

Blame: Lecturer Brian Dodgeon and his partner Angela Hadjipateras were 70 miles away and the coroner said today: 'If the party had been supervised Isobel would not have died'

Isobel and others discovered Dodgeon’s drugs after rummaging through his bedroom cupboards between 12.30am and 1am.

The schoolgirl, who had been drinking vodka and Strongbow cider during the party, is thought to have swallowed two high-purity pills from the tin of narcotic.

Around an hour later, her body temperature rocketed to deadly levels as she began sweating profusely, constantly moving around, and talking incessantly.

One friend, who had also taken ecstasy that night, said: ‘She was all over the place, people came and told me she was out of it.

‘She was crawling and rolling over the bed. At one point, I saw her banging at the window of the bedroom.’

Pals told the inquest Isobel, who was already receiving drug counselling at school for cannabis use, pleaded with them not to call an ambulance when she first began acting strangely.

Dr Avalon Probst, a consultant at Charing Cross Hospital, said Isobel could have been saved if paramedics had been called immediately.

‘The fact we have a description of a person not right for about an hour, there is a window there’, she said.

‘Had that been taken, this life might have been saved.’

But it was not until after 4am that someone dialled 999, and when paramedics arrived, Isobel’s face was already stiff and her body temperature had reached 41 degrees Celsius.

The Chiswick Community School pupil was rushed to hospital but died later that morning.

Dodgeon, who tried to kill himself by jumping off a road bridge in east London a week after Isobel died, wiped away a tear as he offered an apology to the teenager’s parents.

Turning to Lynne Jones and Patrick Reilly, sitting in the front row of the court, he said in evidence: ‘I am so sorry about what happened.

‘All I can say was at the time I didn’t feel as though it was irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised.’

He added: ‘In retrospect, I very much regret I had drugs at all and I made that decision.’

Hearing: An inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court in London heard that the schoolgirl would 'probably' have survived if she had received medical attention when she first started to feel unwell

But Dodgeon, a research fellow at the University of London’s Institute of Education, continued to insist it was not reckless to leave the party unsupervised.

‘At the time, it didn’t seem likely that anybody would come into our bedroom and start systematically looking through the drawers’, he said.

‘There was a 0.1 per cent chance of anyone finding those drugs, there is also a 0.1 per cent chance that someone might turn the cooker on and some kind of gas malfunction causes a fire and people die.’

Ms Hadjipateras told the inquest she believed it was a ‘manageable risk’ when they left the party of more than 20 teenagers alone for the night.

They had asked a neighbour to be ‘on call’ during the party, and she claimed to not know exactly where Dodgeon kept his drug stash herself.

But Dr Wilcox ruled it was ‘highly likely’ Ms Hadjipateras knew about the drugs in the house.

‘I find it difficult to believe didn’t know there were drugs in that house, they had been living together and sharing that bedroom for fifteen years’, she said.

‘I have consider this was an explanation put together after the event to try to avoid culpability failing on Ms Hadjipateras, but I can’t come to a firm conclusion on that.’

Ms Jones, Isobel’s mother, told the court she would never allowed Isobel to go to the party, in Kensington, had she known it was unsupervised.

‘We know young people put themselves in risky situations, particularly if there are no adults around and if they know no adults of coming back’, she said.

‘I think it is pretty obvious so many things could have gone wrong and I’m not even thinking about drugs, but young people bringing in alcohol, older kids finding out and breaking into the house, and accidents happening.

‘I do think we were naive, but we clearly thought at that age, children would not be left unsupervised.’

Dr Wilcox said rejected parts of Dodgeon and Hadjipateras’ evidence, accusing them of ‘post event justification’ for their actions and for being inconsistent.

‘They appeared to state they wanted to give the impression they might be coming back, but considered against the evidence, I make a finding of fact that there was a general understanding they would be away for the night’, she said.

‘The evidence of Brian Dodgeon and Angela Hadjipateras I do not accept, I find it was post event justification.’

She recorded a narrative verdict which concluded: ‘Leaving the stash unsecured and the party unsupervised were both serious failures ... and led to the death.’

In a statement released after the inquest into Isobel’s death, her parents said: ‘They knowingly left a party of 14 and 15-year-olds all night, with a substantial quantity of class A drugs in an unlocked cupboard.

'We thought Isobel was in a safe place, somewhere she had stayed before and we would not have let her go if we had known it was to be unsupervised.

‘What is so painful was for us to learn that, if a responsible adult had been there to call an ambulance early enough, Isobel’s life could have been saved.’
