Brendan Rodgers insists sentiment has no bearing on his determination to see Steven Gerrard be given a contract extension.

Liverpool’s captain, who is out of contract next June, raised the prospect that he could play somewhere else next season, after he revealed in an interview with Sportsmail last week that he had yet to be offered a new deal and has no plans to retire.

That statement pricked the ears of several managers, notably Manchester City’s Manuel Pellegrini, who admitted he would certainly consider a move for the 34-year-old, as he believes Gerrard has the quality to ‘continue at a high level for a couple more years’.

Crucially, though, so does Rodgers and he explained that his motives for wanting to keep Gerrard as the heart of his team have got nothing to do with the fact he has been at the club all his life or because he has a strong relationship with him.

Rodgers has held initial discussions with Gerrard’s representatives and has recommended to Fenway Sports Group, the club’s American owners, that his terms be renewed. Liverpool hope to have the matter concluded swiftly once formal talks begin.

‘It is certainly not sentimental,’ said Rodgers. ‘As the manager of this club, you can’t afford to do that. I look at his contribution since I’ve been here. I came here two-and-a-half years ago when Steven was 32, had struggled with injury and hadn’t played consistently over a number of years.

'I came in, sold him the idea and the philosophy of how we wanted to work and his importance to it. In that period, he has been outstanding. Maybe the team hasn’t played so well this year - and maybe there is a focus on Steven - but he’s been brilliant for me.

‘Both on and off the field, as a leader and a captain, and I want to ensure that on this second curve we’re on, in terms of the development of this group, he is very much a part of that. So there is certainly no sentiment involved in it.

Ayoze Perez’s strike for Newcastle United in the 1-0 win over Liverpool ensured this game’s ability to keep producing goals continues. These clubs have not shared a 0-0 draw since February 1974. 

‘When you see some of his passes and his influence in the changing room, he is still an outstanding player. He is the perfect example for a lot of our players to learn from.’

Too many of his colleagues failed to impose themselves on a drab contest from which Newcastle managed to chisel a 1-0 win thanks to Ayoze Perez’s goal.

Newcastle celebrate after Ayoze's goal inflicted Liverpool's fourth Premier League defeat  in ten games

Champions League holders Real Madrid eased to a 4-0 victory at Granada on Saturday, with Cristiano Ronaldo incredibly scoring his 22nd goal of the season.

It was the Galacticos’ 11th straight win ahead of Tuesday’s clash against Liverpool.

Liverpool’s form has been wretched and since the start of September, they have floundered in the Premier League, winning just two of their seven assignments. On Tuesday they face a huge task in Madrid against Champions League holders Real.

A showdown with Chelsea at Anfield then awaits next Saturday and with no momentum behind them, few will give Liverpool a chance of taking anything from either assignment.

Rodgers, though, is refusing to grumble. ‘It is why we worked so hard,’ said Rodgers. ‘We wanted to be involved in this type of game, (against Real Madrid), because it means we’ve been successful.

‘This result wasn’t what we wanted and we have to work to rectify it.’
