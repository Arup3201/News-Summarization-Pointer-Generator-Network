An Ohio woman who lives at a retirement home and turned 100 on Monday had just one wish for her birthday: She wanted to do some yard work and smell fresh-cut grass.

Trudy Price, of Bowling Green, has gotten her wish with the help of the grounds crew at Bowling Green State University.

She pushed one of the university's mowers and then helped plant flowers near the student union on campus.

Looking good, Trudy!: To mark the celebration of her 100th birthday on Monday, Trudy Price, who lives in a retirement village in Bowling Green, Ohio, wanted to do some gardening and smell fresh cut grass. And she did just that

She also sat atop one of the crew's riding lawn mowers.

Price says staying active is important.

She says she has always loved of the smell of cut grass and still likes to go out for walks at the retirement community where she lives.

Brookdale Senior Living and Wish of a Lifetime formed a partnership to provide a helping hand in making Price's dream of mowing a lawn and planting flowers come true.
