An Australian film company has halted preproduction of its upcoming film 'Deep Water' because of eerie similarities the plot has to the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight 370.

The action horror feature, from Arclight Films, tells the story of a China-bound flight that mysteriously crashes in a remote stretch of ocean. The survivors then have to fend off hungry sharks as 'the plane is starting to sink into a bottomless abyss.'

'Out of sensitivity to the Malaysia flight situation, we've decided to put it on pause for now,' Arclight Films managing director Gary Hamilton told The Hollywood Reporter Monday.

The news comes as Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told a press conference new analysis suggested the flight ended in the southern Indian Ocean, and that all those on board are now dead.

The creepily similar film plot had been promoted with the tagline: 'Survivors of a plane crash face terror beyond reckoning as the plane is starting to sink into a bottomless abyss and soon discover they're surrounded by the deadliest natural born killers on earth.'

It's not the first time Alister Grierson, the film's director, has had a project scuppered by real-life disasters. Two weeks before the 2011 release of his best known film Sanctum, about an underwater cave diving expedition gone wrong, Australia was hit by disastrous floods.

The Queensland-based filmmaker said he couldn't deny the strange timing between his project and the real-life drama of MH3L0.

But despite saying it was 'mysterious,' he insists that his film is vastly different.

On Sunday, before it was confirmed 
the plane crashed into the Indian Ocean, he told MailOnline: 'The 
similarities and timing is interesting and I can see why anecdotally the
 two things link up, it's a tricky thing.

'But
 in simple terms, Deep Water is about an accident that happens on an 
airplane which goes down in the ocean, and the survivors trying to stay 
alive afterwards.

'It's
 more complicated than that as there are villains and sharks, but it's a
 fun action/adventure with thrills and spills and scares.'

Grierson
 and Australian company Arclight Films began pre-production on Deep 
Water at Village Roadshow Studios in Queensland weeks before the 
real-life incident.

It is 
unclear when preproduction will resume on the film, but it will be at 
least two years before the movie makes it to cinemas.

Grierson's
 first big budget feature Sanctum - produced by Avatar filmmaker James 
Cameron - was two weeks out from release when Queensland and Northern 
New South Wales were hit by devastating floods in 2011.

'The floods came through and destroyed whole areas, with people losing their lives,' he said.

'We had this weird situation where we were about to release a film where there's flooding and people drown. It was strange territory.'

Grierson said Deep Water was likely to be a co-production with China, who also worked with the same Australian crew on kitsch shark thriller Bait with Sharni Vinson and Julian McMahon.

'We've nicknamed it Bait 2 because there's a lot of the same crew and even themes, but it's a stand alone story,' he said of Deep Water.

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 vanished from civilian radar screens less than an hour after take-off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing with 239 people on board on March 8.

No confirmed sighting of the plane has been made since, but much debris has been found in remote waters off Australia which might be part of the missing plane.

Relatives of passengers in Beijing had been called to a hotel near the airport to hear the prime minister's press conference Monday, and some 50 of them gathered there. Afterward, they filed out of a conference room in heart-wrenching grief.
