A 13-year-old football player is in critical condition after a lightning bolt struck the field during practice.

Hunter Keffer was walking on the field outside Picacho Middle School in Las Cruces, New Mexico when the bolt struck a tree at 5pm on Tuesday and hurtled towards him and team members.

Keffer dropped to the ground and was not breathing when a parent ran over and gave him CPR, witnesses said. The boy was then rushed to MountainView Regional Medical Center.

He was later transferred to the pediatric burn unit at University Medical Center of El Paso, where he was 'in stable condition and breathing on his own', his mother, a language teacher at the school, wrote online, the Las Cruces Sun-News reported.

The teen suffered the most serious injuries, but two other boys and a coach also suffered minor injuries and were taken to hospital as a precaution.

The group had been leaving practice and heading for shelter because of sudden heavy rain when the field was struck without warning on Tuesday afternoon.

'I had seen the flash,' eighth grade football player Emiliano Frano told KVIA. 'It was gross - I never smelled anything like that.'

He said people started falling after the strike spread out across the ground.

Terrifying: A boy - not Keffer - waits in an ambulance to receive medical treatment following the strike

Distraught: Friends and family become emotional at the scene following the freak accident on Tuesday

'There were people panicking, crying, you
 know, people not knowing who got hit,' Franco said. 'I've never seen 
anything like that.'

The group then noticed that Keffer was
 on the ground not breathing and completely stiff, witnesses told KVIA. A
 parent rushed to give him CPR.

'The
 CPR that he received on the field was what kept him long enough for the
 paramedics to resuscitate him and stabilize him,' Picacho Middle 
language arts teacher Dawson Yarbrough.

Music teacher Emmanuel Hernandez added that if it hadn't been for the quick-thinking parent, 'it would be a different story'.

Hospitalized: Hunter was not breathing when parents and staff ran over to him, and one parent carried out CPR on him. He is now breathing on his own and listed in stable condition

Scene: The lightning hit tall trees at the back of the football field and then traveled along the ground

Jo Galván, Las Cruces Public Schools spokeswoman, said the coaches had not seen any lightning or rain at the start of practice.

Counselors and psychologists will be at the school on Wednesday to speak with any Picacho Middle School students or adults who want to speak about the incident.

The police department told residents they should remain indoors or beneath a shelter during lightning storms.
