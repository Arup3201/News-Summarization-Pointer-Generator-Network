Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are no strangers to the City of Lights.

Whether the stylish couple is in town to take in the shows of Paris Fashion Week or simply spend some time exploring the city's high-end boutiques and world renowned restaurants, Kim and Kanye aren't shy about splurging on the best that the French capital has to offer.

Most days, they can be spotted sitting front row at the Grand Palais, or supporting friend and Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing at his high-profile celebrations, but where do they spend time during those moments of coveted Parisian downtime?

From their incredibly lavish hotel, Le Royal Monceau, to Kim Kardashian's favourite restaurant, the beloved 1er arrondissement eatery, Ferdi, MailOnline Travel takes you inside all of Kim and Kanye's most-frequented off-duty haunts...

When in town, Kim and Kanye love to stay at the luxurious, five-star hotel, Le Royal Monceau, owned by the Raffles Hotel Group

Le Royal Monceau was recently renovated in 2010 when celebrated French designer, Philippe Starck, put his unique stamp on the property

The Parisian hotel has been described as a 'French masterpiece,' thanks to it's high-profile makeover, which includes its own cinema

This luxury five-star hotel, located just steps from the Champs-Elysées, is continually rated as one of the best - not only in Paris, but in all of France.

It's no surprise then that it satisfies Kim and Kanye's discerning tastes.

The fashionable couple are known to stay at the hotel whenever they're in town and with its airy, stylish rooms, luxurious Clarins spa, and many fine dining options, it's easy to see why.

But such sleek, Philippe Starck-designed opulence doesn't come cheap! Suites can run as much as €3980 (£2862) per night.

Kim is a front row mainstay during Paris Fashion Week, often stopping by to lend her support to friend, Balmain designer, Olivier Rousteing

Rousteing is known for selecting the historic InterContinental Le Grand Hotel for his showings, also attended by the likes of Jared Leto

Le Grand Hotel 

The Paris Fashion Week space favoured by many top designers is practically a second Parisian home for front row mainstays Kim and Kanye.

When they aren't cheering on little sister Kendall Jenner strutting her stuff on the catwalks at the Grand Palais, Kim and Kanye can be found rubbing elbows with their A-list friends while supporting Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing at his beloved show location in the city's InterContinental hotel.

At Rousteing's most recent showing, Kim caught up with actor Jared Leto, who was also sporting a new blond hairstyle.

During their most recent visit to the French capital, Kim and Kanye had a meeting at the impressive Louis Vuitton Foundation headquarters

The duo's meeting was initially said to be 'top-secret,' but it was actually to discuss Kanye's performance, held there later in the week

Louis Vuitton Foundation 

The remarkable building that houses the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a museum and cultural centre sponsored by the LVMH Group, is located in the 16th arrondissement, adjacent to the Jardin d'Acclimatation amusement park.

During their most recent trip to the City of Lights, Kim and Kanye stopped by the Frank Gehry-designed property for a top-secret visit to the space where the rapper would ultimately perform later in the week.

Kim shared photos of her husband's spectacular stage show on Instagram after the fact, though explained that it was 'hard to describe how cool it looked.'

Talk about a good friend! Kim, along with her mum, Kris Jenner, always visit the Balmain store to splurge on some of Rousteing's latest looks

Triangle d’Or

Kim Kardashian loves to hit the high-end designer shops when she's in town - and with such incredible offerings as Celine, Chanel and Hermes, who can blame her?

Among her favourite haunts is the Balmain store, located on Rue Francois-1er, not far from the Champs-Elysees.

She loves her pal Olivier Rousteing's designs so much, in fact, that during her last visit to the City of Lights, Kim even brought her mum, Kris Jenner, along to the luxury store for a bit of retail therapy. 

Following a quick bite to eat at celebrity-loved, L'Avenue, Kim and her mum were mobbed while walking back to their car

L’Avenue 

As any celebrity will tell you, when you're visiting Paris - otherwise known as one of the food capitals of the world - L'Avenue is the ultimate spot to grab a bite to eat.

Located in the 8th arrondissement, the Costes Brothers brassiere is just a stone's throw from Christian Dior and is veiled in sleek, red velvet, adding to the mystery of the entire establishment.

While the dining room, with its Murano chandeliers is not to be missed, in warmer weather, the A-list clientele prefer to sit outside on the terrace.

During this spring's Paris Fashion Week, Kim and her mum, Kris, were mobbed while exiting the traditional French eatery.

Kim also loves the gourmet bar, Ferdi, which she once called her 'favourite restaurant' during an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians

Ferdi’s 

Another of Kim and Kanye's go-to gastronomic picks is Ferdi, which is widely believed to have the best cheeseburger in all of Paris.

Kim was spotted at the bar gourmet last September, enjoying the restaurant's eclectic mix of items, which includes Venezuelan tapas, and has even mentioned that the eatery is one of her favourites on her hit TV show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

Think the celebrity-loved locale is out of your price range? Think again. Prices are actually quite moderate given it's 1st arrondissement location.

Kim caused with the spectacle when she debuted her brand new platinum blonde locks upon her arrival in the French capital

Just days after showing off her new 'do, however, Kim went even blonder, thanks to the colourists at the exclusive L'Atelier Blanc salon

Kim's newest hair colour, an almost-white shade, was crafted in the chic salon, where appointments range from between €400 to €700

L’Atelier Blanc 

Kim caused quite the stir when she debuted her brand new platinum blonde hair in Paris last week, but imagine the world's surprise when she went from blonde to nearly white, courtesy of the city's exclusive L'Atelier Blanc hair salon, just days later.

The team of expert colourists, led by Frederic Mennetrier, are world renowned for their incredible, personalised service, and prices range from between €400 to €700 depending on the colour, care and cut.

And any customer will be required to spend quite a bit of time in the salon's chic, all-white surroundings - the team asks for at least three hours during your first appointment to ensure you achieve your perfect look.

In Kim's case, that's a nearly-white blonde hue, complemented by the stark contrast of her bold eyebrows.

In between shows, Kim and her mum, Kris, stopped by Le Bristol Hotel before heading out to get lunch at L'Avenue

The hotel has played host to some of the world's most famous, including Victoria and David Beckham who've stayed in the Imperial Suite

The five-star hotel, ideally situated on fashionable Rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré, Le Bristol is as known for its lavish guest rooms as it is for its Michelin-starred restaurants.

Kim and her mum were spotted spending time at the hotel before heading out to the equally-stylish L'Avenue.

Le Bristol is one of the most exclusive properties in the city, famed for it's £15,000-a-night Imperial Suite, which has hosted the likes of David and Victoria Beckham.
