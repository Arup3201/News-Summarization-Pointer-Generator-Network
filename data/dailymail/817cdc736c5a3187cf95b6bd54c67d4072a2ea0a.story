For more than a century and a half the simple symmetry of these former almshouses had remained an undisturbed gem.

But that was before the unstoppable march of multi-coloured wheelie bins reached their village.

The elderly residents of the historic terrace were shocked by the arrival of not one but three bins for each cottage – a total of 21 for the row – as well as two smaller indoor bins each, including an orange ‘caddy’ for waste food.

New delivery: The wheelie bins were lined up outside these attractive cottages on Elizabeth Owen Terrace in Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd, Denbighshire by the local council

They claimed that the bins blocked off
wheelchairs, ambulances and even the postman – as well as marring the 
Victorian mock Gothic architecture.

Unsightly: Each of the seven cottages received five bins, making 35 in total

Since they first rolled into 
Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd, Denbighshire, earlier this month, however, the 
majority have mysteriously vanished. Denbighshire council said it had 
not removed them.

Yesterday residents complained that 
those which remain outside Elizabeth Owen Terrace are still an eyesore 
and a hazard.

‘I can hardly breathe, never mind move bins around,’ said 
77-year-old William Perry.

'Some of the neighbours had to come round and 
move the bins away from my front door because I couldn’t get out, and I 
can’t use the back door because of my disability. 

'I was trapped. And 
the ambulance comes here a lot and parks outside, but there is no way an
ambulance can get here now.’

Mr Perry, who has a severe heart 
problem and only one lung, said his 90-year-old neighbour was ‘nearly in
tears’ at the situation.

Fire hazard: The bins were delivered straight in front of the cottages, blocking some of the elderly residents in their homes

How it looked before: One of the idyllic cottages on Elizabeth Owen Terrace in Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd in Denbighshire before the delivery of wheelie bins

‘She was so worried about what she was
going to do with all these bins,’ he said.

The cottages were built as 
almshouses in the mid-19th century, and are still offered to pensioners 
at affordable rents.

Their rubbish was previously collected in bags, but now each cottage has three wheelie bins 
collected fortnightly - a black one for general rubbish, a blue one for
recyclables and a green one for garden waste.
