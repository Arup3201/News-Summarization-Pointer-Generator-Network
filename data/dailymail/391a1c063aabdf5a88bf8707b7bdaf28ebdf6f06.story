Gone too soon: Comic icon Joan Rivers fully expected to exit the Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic after her procedure to meet up with friends. Instead, the 81-year old went into cardiac arrest and died days later

Heartbroken: Melissa Rivers has hired a top NYC law firm to launch legal action against the clinic where her mother suffered cardiac arrest following a routine endoscopy, leading to her death on September 4

The doctors involved in carrying out what was meant to be a routine throat procedure, named previously as Dr Lawrence Cohen and Dr Gwen Korovin, will also be named in the suit, according to the New York Post.

The news come after family friends confirmed to MailOnline that heartbroken Melissa planned to sue the clinic following her mother's death age 81 on September 4. 

Earlier this month, the friend said: 'Melissa does plan to sue the clinic. It's very difficult to discuss something so unpleasant with her, but she is going to launch a lawsuit. 

Questions from friends and family that have yet to be answered include whether there was actually an anesthesiologist present as Joan underwent the endoscopy. 

Gair, Gair, Conason, Steigman, Mackauf, Bloom & Rubinowitz is one of the oldest law firms in New York City, founded in 1919, and is said to be 'highly selective' about its cases. 

BFFs: Distraught Melissa posted a picture of her son Cooper and her mother Joan, writing: 'Connecticut, 2004. Mom + Cooper = BFFs... A perfect day. #TBT'

Still working: Dr Gwen Korovin is still working at her Manhattan office. She charges $460 for an initial consultation and does not accept insurance. She is believed to have been in the room at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic when Joan Rivers went into cardiac arrest on August 28

​Rivers’ official cause of death is “anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest during laryngoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with propofol sedation.”

The firm needs to obtain Joan's medical records before filing a case in Manhattan Supreme Court and her will also needs to submitted to court and an executor appointed by the judge. 

It won $3 million for the Diallo family and recen​​tly scored a whopping $27.5 million verdict for a New York City woman who was run over by an MTA bus.

Joan suffered cardiac arrest following an endoscopy at Yorkville on August 28.

Paramedics then rushed the star to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later.

CNN reported that a source close to the investigation into Joan's death being carried out by the New York State Department of Health said she suffered a cardiac arrest following the endoscopy as her personal doctor, believed to be Dr Gwen Korovin, performed an 'unauthorized procedure'.

According to CNN, several clinic workers told investigators the procedure began with Dr Korovin performing a laryngoscopy, which involves using a device to view a patient's vocal folds.

Doctor of choice: Dr Korovin - pictured at her Manhattan home last month - counts celebrities including Hugh Jackman - who performed at Joan Rivers' funeral, Daniel Radcliffe, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande among her famous patients

Gone: Gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, the medical director of Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic, stepped down from his position. He carried out an endoscopy on Joan Rivers on August 28. It was later reported he had allowed a specialist, who was not authorized to practice at the clinic, to examine the star

Dr. Lawrence Cohen, a longtime gastroenterologist, then performed an endoscopy to diagnose why she was suffering a sore throat and hoarseness, the source said. 

The clinic, however, denies reports that a vocal cord biopsy was performed moments before Joan went into cardiac arrest. 

Legal action: Melissa Rivers is set to file a law suit against Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic in NYC

Dr Korovin - who charges $460 for an initial consultation and does NOT take insurance - was authorized only to observe Dr Cohen, since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source told CNN. 

Dr Korovin, 56, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients.

Sources close to the specialist have already been forced to deny that Dr Korovin took a 'selfie' picture while Joan was under anesthesia.

Dr. Korovin's  lawyer, Michael Kelton, released a statement to MailOnline, saying:  'Gwen S. Korovin, M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

'For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients.' 

Famous clientele: Dr Gwen Korovin, who was in the room when Joan Rivers underwent her ill-fated procedure, counts Celine Dion as one of her patients. In the singer's 2010 documentary, Dr Korovin performs a laryngoscopy on the star and they talk about her resting her vocal chords

Celeb doctor: Pop princess Ariana Grande posted a picture of Dr Korovin giving her a B12 shot in her bottom before an appearance with Jimmy Fallon

Dr Korovin is still believed to be working and accepting new patients, although Mr Kelton's office declined to comment, While Dr Cohen has stepped down from Yorkville Endoscopy clinic. 

Meanwhile, the New York Medical Examiner's Office has yet to release the exact cause of death for Joan Rivers.
