A GP surgery tried to ban its own patients from posting negative comments about the practice on social media.

A poster at the St Lawrence Medical Practice in Braintree, Essex, warned patients that criticisms  could be treated as a breach of its 'zero tolerance policy' against abusive treatment if posted on Facebook and Twitter. 

The request was made after staff allegedly saw bad language used to describe the surgery's standard of care on a Facebook page.

The sign, which has since been changed, read: 'If you have any comments or complaints about the surgery please write to the practice manager', and warned people not to take their grievances to social media sites

The sign, which has since been changed, read: 'If you have any comments or complaints about the surgery please write to the practice manager. 

'Do not use social media sites, Facebook/Twitter. 

'Any comments we see on social media sites may be seen as a breach of our zero tolerance policy. 

'We are happy to deal with your comments/complaints in the usual way.' 

Practice Manager Alison Rudkin said the sign had been changed and now says: 'This ensures we can respond to people's concerns with patient confidentiality in mind'. 

Katherine Murphy, Chief Executive of The Patients Association which gathers healthcare feedback from people all over the UK said: 'We believe people should be able to share and explore good and not so good feedback, and also to leave feedback on their personal experiences across the entire spectrum of healthcare.

'We know that capturing this type of experience and sharing it openly and transparently will lead to patient empowerment.

'It will highlight excellence but also highlight where there is poor practice. It's really important from a patients point of view in order for them to make an informed decision. 

'I absolutely think that patients are more likely to give a more open and honest opinion on social media or in forums where they are speaking with their peers.'

The NHS Zero Tolerance Policy states 'any act of aggression, violence or intimidation, both physical and non-physical from any member of staff, patient, visitor or member of the public is unacceptable. 

'As an organisation, we are committed to introducing measures, through the Zero Tolerance Policy and relevant guidelines, to reduce risk and to have procedures in place that will enable staff to manage appropriately an aggressive or violent situation should it arise.'

Ms Rudkin said they put the sign up after staff discovered personal comments using bad language about themselves online. 

'Those sort of comments and that sort of language is a form of bullying,' she said. 

'We would much rather people come and see us in person if they have something they want to say.

'We can't respond to people properly if they choose to make their comments on Facebook or Twitter.' 

St Lawrence Medical Practice refused to comment when contacted by MailOnline this afternoon.
