NBC's $25million man may be forced to take a dramatic cut in pay if the Today show viewership continues to fall.

Plagued by plummeting ratings and a declining personal favorability, Matt Lauer may be asked to sacrifice his huge NBC paycheck if the Today show's situation doesn't improve.

The morning show is taking a major hit in viewership following the tearful departure of former co-host Ann Curry in June.

The network is now reportedly examining whether Lauer is worth what he's being paid.

A source close to the situation told Radar Online: 'Matt Lauer will be asked to take a significant cut in his $25million salary if TODAY doesn't win the key November sweeps.'

'The May and November sweeps dictate how much the networks can charge for advertising and they are extremely important to the bottom line. The TODAY show had always been a cash cow for NBC, generating hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue.'

Radar reported that NBC Universal is now
 looking at the budgets of the network’s shows, and seeing where cuts 
can be made, and in the news division, a significant portion pays 
Lauer's salary.

The network insider said: 'Matt's salary
 is the biggest part of the TODAY show's budget and with Good Morning 
America now routinely beating them, it's just hard to justify that 
salary.

Such a cut in pay is not unheard of at the network.

Earlier this month, it was reported that late night host Jay Leno would be cutting his salary by 50 per cent to just $15million to combat budget cuts.

Meanwhile, it has been reported that Morning Joe newsman Willie Geist will join the Today show to to serve as co-host during the 9am hour.

The New York Times' Media Decoder blog reported that Geist will back up Lauer and will share hosting duties with Natalie Morales, Al Roker and Savannah Guthrie starting at 9am.

The trouble began for Today with Ann Curry's unceremonious booting off the show back in June, after it was claimed that Lauer was responsible for getting her axed. 

Curry’s departure from her 'dream job' after just year in the role was tearful and on camera she told viewers that she had tried her best, although she apparently failed.

The 55-year-old was promptly replaced by Guthrie, 40.

But viewers were unimpressed with Curry’s treatment and Today has not had the audience ratings it was hoping for with Guthrie on the sofa.

Viewership has been slipping away from the Today show as rival Good Morning America has been gaining ground, winning the ratings war for the past two weeks.

Early data shows that the ABC morning show will most likely win for a third week, as well.

Additionally, in the 10 weeks before Curry quit, Today got 4.94 million viewers, but in the 10 weeks since she left there were just 4.6 million.

The moment Lauer lost his likability? Curry's unceremonious booting off the show has long been a thorn in Lauer's side, after it was claimed he was responsible for getting her axed

Adding to his grief over diminishing ratings, the New York Post ran an article on Wednesday about Lauer's domineering style at NBC.

Sources told Page Six that Lauer is now 'running the show and he’s not listening to anyone,' causing a 'huge problem.'

Another source lamented that the staff is overworked in an effort to catch up to GMA's ratings.

'Matt's telling the staff they don’t work hard enough, which is hard to take from a guy working four days a week, making millions,' the source told Page Six.

Responding to Page Six’s request for comment, Lauer said: 'Please print this story - it's the most interesting and dangerous I've ever sounded!'

Earlier this year, Lauer signed a contract reportedly worth $25 million to stay on the show.
