An Australian man is the first to be convicted in an online sting, where charity workers went undercover as a 10 year old girl from the Philippines called 'Sweetie'. 

In just two months, the programme which aims to stop the webcam child sex tourism, tracked down and identified 1,000 paedophiles and in November their information was passed on to interpol and then to police all over the globe.

'Sweetie' created by a child exploitation organisation in the Netherlands, Terre Des Hommes, is a computer model who looks and moves like a real girl.

The online sting, which used a virtual 10 year old Filipino girl, 'Sweetie' identified 1,000 paedophiles in just two months, one Australian man has been convicted

Four operators worked in teams to take on the role of becoming 'Sweetie' in a 10 week period in June and July last year.  

When 'Sweetie' was online, men were tracked down using bits of information which allowed them to collect names and addresses, phone numbers, pictures and video footage.

The names of 46 Australian men were thought to be among those involved. 

110 of those who made contact are also believed to be British, with their names and information sent to the UK's National Crime Agency - although so far no arrests have been made. 

These men requested 'Sweetie' perform sex acts in front of a webcam for money.

In an online campaign video against the webcam child sex tourism, the virtual image of 'Sweetie' can be seen and details what operators are forced to deal with when the virtual child logs online.

The computer image says, 'every day I have to sit in front of the webcam and talk to men, just like tens of thousands of other kids. The men ask me to take off my clothes, they undress.'

'They play with themselves, they want me to play with myself. As soon as I go online they come to me. Ten, hundred, every hour, so many.'

Every day 750,000 are online trying to achieve this sexual contact with minors, victimising minors from poorer countries like the Philippines

'But what they don't know, I'm not real, I'm a computer model made piece by piece to track down men who do this.'

Head of programme 'Sweetie' Hans Guyt says the children they are dealing with suffer from depression, anxiety and aggression

It said once 'Sweetie' is online they (men) swarm her, they contact kids on dating sites, social network sites and public chat rooms. 

Head of the programme, Hans Guyt says the children they are dealing with suffer from depression, anxiety and aggression.

'They have no idea about normal relationships, they have no idea about sexuality and what makes it worse is that it is on the increase, therefore we have sifted our attention to the demand side,' he said.

'If nothing is being done about the source of the problem this phenomenon will only increase even further.'

While the organisation has only ever found six men that have ever been charged, in just two months 1,000 were implicated and now one man convicted from Australia.

Scott Robert Hansen, who is a registered sex offender, pleaded guilty to three charges in Brisbane District Court. 

Those charges were using a carriage service to transmit indecent communications to a child under 16.

Also failure to comply with a sex offenders order because of an earlier conviction of child abuse and possession of child pornography.

He was sentenced to two years in prison, but is not expected to go to jail because of he has already served time in custody. 

There were 1,000 men identified in the programme 'Sweetie' which aim was to stop webcam child sex tourism. These men requested 'Sweetie' perform sex acts in front of a webcam for money

When 'Sweetie' was online, men were tracked down using bits of information which allowed them to collect names and addresses, phone numbers, pictures and video footage

As soon as 'Sweetie' went to log online, many men contacted her and requested she perform sexual acts in front of the webcam for money

He was sentenced to an intensive corrections order for 12 months where he must not commit another offence, report to officers and receive counselling.

Hansen also agreed to participate in a sexual offenders program, suggested by the judge.

The BBC News obtained the chat logs of Hansen's conversations.

Hansen started by asking: 'hi u really 9yo'

The operator replied: 'Yes,' to which he wrote: 'wanna chat or cam with older?'

He went on: 'I like asian chicks, are you... for action'

His comments became more explicit: 'I'm naked, ever seen a guy naked?'

He then turned on his webcam and performed a sex act in front of what he believed was a nine-year-old girl. 

'We do think its a breakthrough,' said Paul Wolters from Terre Des Hommes.

'The judge actually convicted him of indecent contact with an avatar, virtual account,' he said.

'The judge said 'if you believe that it is a nine year old girl, it is law and that is good enough'.'

He says the organisation is not there to be investigators but to raise awareness of the problem of the webcam child sex tourism.

1,000 men were tracked and identified during the online sting 'Sweetie' and their information was passed on to interpol

'The issue is that it's a growing problem. Every day 750,000 are online trying to achieve this sexual contact with minors, victimising minors from poorer countries like the Philippines,' he said.

'The traditional investigative operation is they (police) wait for victims to file a complaint and obviously these minors, they're never going to file a complaint.'

'It's not enough, you have to pro-actively catch the offenders.'

'We've proved that it's relatively easy to identify people and bring them to court.'  

Mr Wolters says the four operators who posed as 'Sweetie' have also received counselling following the operation.

'It was very distressing for them, they received very disturbing material, proposals, questions and content of conversation.'

Terre Des Hommes, a charity organisation, conducted the 'Sweetie programme and had workers posing as a 10 year old Filipino girl. Most men would come from rich countries and pray on children from poor countries

'Every day 750,000 are online trying to achieve this sexual contact with minors, victimising minors from poorer countries like the Philippines,' said Paul Wolters from Terre Des Hommes

There is a petition by charity organisation Terre Des Hommes to stop webcam child sex tourism. They are also campaigning for authorities to take a more pro-active approach to the problem which is growing worldwide

'This one guy said the guy who got convicted (the Australian man) was not among the worse.'

The programme 'Sweetie' has been halted but Terre Des Hommes is working on a continuation of the project, although have been vague on its details.

The organisation hopes many more convictions will follow and it serves as a message to authorities that they need to actively try to stop what is happening on webcams all around the globe. 

The UK's National Crime Agency's, Director General recently made a comment that a wider debate is needed on how the UK manages offenders accessing indecent images of children online, with indications around 50,000 people in the UK are viewing indecent images.

'I personally, and my colleagues across law enforcement, find this behaviour abhorrent. All of us would like to see these people in court and we are determined to bring as many to justice as we possibly can,' said Keith Bristol.
