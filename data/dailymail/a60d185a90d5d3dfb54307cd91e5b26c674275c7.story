A grandfather who died after he was punched by a pensioner in a row over a disabled parking space had only last week been told he had beaten cancer, it emerged yesterday.

Brian Holmes, 64, was waiting in a disabled parking area at an Asda store on Saturday afternoon when he was punched and knocked to the ground by a 65-year-old man following the disagreement.

The grandfather from Sandy, Bedfordshire, was taken to hospital but died on Sunday afternoon.

Yesterday his family said that he and 
his wife Christine 60, whom he married nine years ago, had only just 
started to plan their future together after his all-clear from cancer.

In a statement, they said: ‘The family are devastated by the loss of Brian in such shocking circumstances.

‘A wife has lost her husband, best friend and carer all in one go.

‘Brian was a family man who adored his
grandchildren and family, and had only last week been given the 
all-clear following treatment for cancer.

‘Brian and his wife were only just starting to make plans for the future that they only dared to dream of.’

Investigation: A 65-year-old man was arrested at his home shortly after and taken to Greyfriars Police Station in Bedford, before rearrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death

A neighbour at the couple’s former home yesterday said that Mrs  Holmes sometimes needed to walk with a crutch.

Mr Holmes was shopping at the Asda 
supermarket in the market town of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, at around 
3pm on Saturday when he was attacked.

Horrified shoppers and staff tried to 
help him until paramedics arrived, but he died in hospital on Sunday 
afternoon surrounded by his family after suffering serious head 
injuries.

The suspected assailant left the 
supermarket immediately after the assault, but was arrested at his home a
short time later on suspicion of manslaughter. He was held in custody 
at a Bedford police station, but was released on bail on Sunday evening.

Medical attention: Mr Holmes was treated in the critical care unit of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge

Detective Inspector Liz Mead of the 
Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, who is 
leading the investigation, said yesterday: ‘This is an extremely sad 
incident which has left a family absolutely devastated and our family 
liaison officers  are doing all that they can to assist and support them
at this very difficult time.

'I would like to hear from anybody who was 
in the car park at Asda on Saturday afternoon and may have seen the 
altercation taking place close to the disabled parking area.

‘A number of people have already come 
forward but it is imperative that we speak with as many people as 
possible and collect all of the facts into what happened.

‘Even the smallest pieces of information could assist us with our inquiries.’

Police refused to confirm the exact nature of the disagreement between the two men.

The Asda car park has ten disabled bays outside the main entrance of the single-storey supermarket.

A spokesman for the supermarket said: ‘We are helping the police get to the bottom of what happened.’

Neighbours last night expressed shock at the death of Mr Holmes.

Pete Sheppard, 59, said: ‘I hope he rests in peace. My thoughts are with his family.’

Another resident, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It’s a needless death over a stupid dispute. I’m so sad for his family.’

Last night no one was available for comment at Mr and Mrs Holmes’ £260,000 four-bedroom detached home.
