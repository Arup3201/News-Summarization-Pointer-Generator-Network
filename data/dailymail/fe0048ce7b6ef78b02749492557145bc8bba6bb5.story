In amongst chasing car theft syndicates and catching armed robbers, Queensland Police have dedicated their crime-fighting efforts to tracking down a distressed citizen who'd lost their camera.

Taking a break from cracking cases on an obviously quiet weekend at Queensland's North Stradbroke Island, Dunwich police uploaded the happy snaps from the lost device onto their social media page.

Cops even issued a press release on Saturday morning, launching a lost-and-found exercise at the popular but relatively quiet beach destination about half an hour off the coast of Brisbane.

Incriminating evidence: Police released three photos from a lost camera on Saturday in an effort to find the items owner

The press release was issued inbetween two serious crimes including a 'organised theft of motor vehicle syndicate' and 'armed robbery'

'The search is on for a snapper who left their camera behind at North Stradbroke Island earlier this year,' the press release stated.

'The camera contains images from around Australia, including North Stradbroke Island and Brisbane, and police want to return it to its rightful owner.'

One of the images, which shows a platter of sweets beside a couple of paper cups filled with chocolate, received a fair amount of attention from Facebook viewers, leading even police to express their cravings.

One particular picture, depicting a table laden with deserts, proved ot be particularly popular on the Queensland Police's Facebook page

'Did you take this photo before enjoying the deliciousness? If so, Dunwich police may have your camera,' the post by Queensland Police Service said.

'Can QPS please help unite me with that deliciousness?!' one person wrote in response to the post.

'That looks like a chocolate sampler from Montys Chocolate in Brisbane. So yummy! I hope you find the owners of the camera,' another person commented.

Queensland police media was quick to respond to the posts, even tellling one woman who announced she was off to sample the photographic 'evidence', 'Enjoy the deliciousness, Anne!'.

The press release issued by the police, urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers

The press release was issued by police in between two far more serious crime stories, including one about the 'organised theft of motor vehicle syndicate' being broken and an 'armed robbery' in Surfers Paradise.

Nonetheless, the public service was sure to remind citizens of the serious nature of the matter at hand, imploring them to make contact with police.

'Anyone with information which could assist with this matter should contact Crime Stoppers anonymously via 1800 333 000 or crimestoppers.com.au 24hrs a day,' the media release said.
