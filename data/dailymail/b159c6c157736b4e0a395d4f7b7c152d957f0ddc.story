A man was crushed to death and two women were injured when a falling tree crashed onto two cars in fierce winds today, as 13 flood alerts were put in place across Britain amid warnings of more severe weather to come.

The tree came down on a road close to Ascot racecourse in Berkshire this afternoon and smashed through two cars, fatally injuring the 64-year-old male driver of one of the vehicles.

The man, who was from Sheffield, was flown to hospital by air ambulance but later died from his injuries.

Severe weather: A person was spotted walking along the shore at Clarence Esplanade in Portsmouth, Hampshire, in the very early hours of this morning, as it was battered with huge waves coming from the sea

A female passenger in the Ford Mondeo, who is aged in her 60s, was also taken to hospital but her injuries were not serious.

The female driver of the second car 
was also taken to Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey after being cut free 
from the wreckage of her blue Mini by firefighters. Her condition is not
believed to be life threatening.

Emergency
services remained at the scene on the A332 Windsor Road tonight, where 
staff from the local council were organising the removal of the fallen 
tree.

Firefighter Steve
Blackman, who attended the scene, said of the male driver: 'Obviously 
he was a very poorly man so the helicopter rushed him away. 

'The
woman in the Mini was very lucky, if she had been in the passenger side
she might not be here now. She was shaken up and a bit panicky.'

The
tragedy occurred as parts of Britain prepared for further flooding and 
travel disruption following heavy rain across the country.

Bournemouth woman Sarah Marshall said she and her neighbours had a lucky escape last night after a six-tonne beech 
tree crashed to the ground inches from their houses.

Mrs Marshall, 43, who had to climb through a hedge to get in and out of her home, said: 'The tree is just huge and it's incredibly surreal seeing it in your drive way. We are lucky it didn't hit the house.

'The road is completely blocked and the council have been here to try and remove some of it. We can't get out of our property very easily as the driveway is the only route out.'

Meanwhile, forecasters
told southern England and Wales to brace for ‘a wet one’ today, after deluges of up to an inch over the past 24 hours - and the Environment 
Agency has 13 flood alerts in place.

But northern areas are expected to 
enjoy a mostly dry day today, and the outlook is much better across the 
UK for the weekend - although southern areas could be hit by some rain 
on Sunday.

National forecaster the Met Office said 0.8 to 1.2in could fall tonight and into tomorrow. As much as 1.6in could fall on the high ground overnight.

Further heavy prolonged rain is forecast for Sunday night, with another 0.8 to 1.2in falling in south west England and south west Wales, and up to 2.4in on the high ground.

A spokesman warned it would be 'very wet and unpleasant' tonight and on Sunday into Monday when the rain hits, but tomorrow is likely to be dry and cloudy with some sunny spells.

Dangerous: Mrs Marshall, 43, who had to climb through a hedge to get in and out of her home, said: 'The tree is just huge and it's incredibly surreal seeing it in your drive way. We are lucky it didn't hit the house'

Periods of 
heavy rain are likely across south Wales, south-west England and the 
south-west Midlands from today until tomorrow morning.

‘There still remains considerable uncertainty in the details of the heavy rain by late Friday and the (yellow) warning may be adjusted further as the event approaches,’ a Met Office spokesman said.

A yellow warning urges the public to ‘be aware’ of severe weather. ‘The public should be aware of the possibility of disruption to travel due to localised flooding,’ the spokesman added.

While the wet weather last night and today would not normally cause flooding, the risk is heightened because the ground in many areas is vulnerable following heavy rain towards the end of last month.

Difficult drive: Flooding hit parts of Cornwall last night, causing problems for drivers in Perranwell this morning

Nick Prebble, a forecaster for 
MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said 1.2in of
rain could hit areas of southern England and Wales today.

'It's going to be a wet one,’ he said. 
‘The spell of rain from overnight should clear away during the day, but 
another pulse will move in later bringing some heavy bursts'

‘It's going to be a wet one,’ he said. 
‘The spell of rain from overnight should clear away during the day, but 
another pulse will move in later bringing some heavy bursts.’

The Environment Agency currently has 13 
flood alerts in place in the south-west, north-west and 
north-east regions.

And this afternoon there was one flood warning in place - for the River 
Ouse just south of York, which saw near-record river levels last week.

The agency is warning of localised flooding today and tomorrow, with surface water affecting land and roads.

Looking ahead: Southern areas could expect temperatures of 14C (57F) to 15C (59F) over the next few days

A spokesman said: 'Further prolonged 
heavy rain on Sunday may result in more significant disruption over 
parts of south west England and Wales, such as flooding of communities 
and travel disruption.'

A lifeboat crew braved 70mph storm force winds early today to save a sailor on the coast.

The drama began just after midnight in treacherous conditions when the 45ft yacht Sea Brigand reported problems with sails between Dartmouth and Kingswear in Devon.

The yacht, with only the skipper on board, was having problems with its sail unfurling in high winds. The sailor was in danger of being thrown into the water in the wind and rain.

When the lifeboat crew arrived the skipper was on the foredeck trying to stop the sail unfurling. The yacht was moved to the Darthaven Marina.

Heavy rain began to move in across Devon, Cornwall and southern Wales late last night with up to 20mm falling in places during the early hours, Met Office forecaster Greg Dewhurst said.

The weather expert said southern areas could expect temperatures of 14C (57F) to 15C (59F) over the next few days, with the London area reaching 17C (63F).

Despite seeing spells of dry and sunny weather, northern areas will feel slightly cooler with temperatures between 12C (54F) and 14C (57F), Mr Dewhurst added.

Yorkshire was the area worst hit by last week’s floods as more than the average rainfall for September fell in just a few days in many parts.

A couple drowned in a swollen river in Wales and a block of townhouses in Newburn, Newcastle, were condemned to be knocked down after floodwater gouged out the earth under their foundations.

More than 500 homes and businesses were flooded across England and Wales.
