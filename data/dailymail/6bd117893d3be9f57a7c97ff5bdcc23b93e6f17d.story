Rincon was abandoned in Puerto Rico.

But it was there he was found by Julian Schratter, a New York model who, together with his three mates, decided to bring the tiny pup back with them to the big city.

Schratter, who has appeared in campaigns for the likes of Ralph Lauren and Armani Exchange, regularly posts photos of his pet pooch to Instagram.

He has since gained a devoted social media following who admire the pair's shared cuteness.

Rincon now lives in Brooklyn with Rincon and fellow models Nick Bateman, Landon Falgoust and Brendon Beck.

'I’d had no earlier inclination to get a dog, but I saw Mooks (Rincon) and picked him up right then and there,' Schratter told Metro.

‘It was love at first site, and very impromptu.'

Rincon has his own Instagram account - rincon_da_bully - and has amassed over 7,000 followers.
