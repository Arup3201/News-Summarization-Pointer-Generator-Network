A mother of three was shot in the head and killed Tuesday when a stray bullet fired from a passing car struck her in broad daylight in front of her San Francisco home.

Maria Lourdes Soza, 32, had just picked her son, 9, and 3-year-old daughter up from school when her life was taken with absolutely no warning.

Police believe the Nicaragua-born mother was an innocent bystander. They are now investigating whether a another shooting that culminated with a blood-covered woman limping into a nearby seafood restaurant minutes later was related to Soza's untimely death.

Tragic: Maria Lourdes Soza, 32, had just picked her son, 9, and 3-year-old daughter up from school when her life was taken with absolutely no warning. Her 13-year-old daughter also witnessed the tragedy

Soza's boyfriend also bore witness to the shooting around 4pm Tuesday in front of her home in the Bayview neighborhood.

He rushed to her aid while they waited for paramedics.

Soza's eldest daughter watched her mother die, as well, and spoke to the SFGate.com on Wednesday.

'My brother was crying. My sister was crying. And I was crying a lot,' the distraught 13-year-old said while mourners gathered at a streetside memorial. 'I can’t do anything without her. I miss her so much. I’ve been crying since yesterday until I fell asleep.'

As Soza's shell-shocked family begins to mourn, San Francisco police are trying to determine if the nearly simultaneous nearby shooting is related.

Soza, a Nicaragua native, was believed to have been an innocent bystander, though police are unsure who fired towards her home in the Bayview neighborhood of San Francisco in broad daylight Tuesday

'My brother was crying. My sister was crying. And I was crying a lot,' the distraught 13-year-old said while mourners gathered at a streetside memorial. 'I can’t do anything without her. I miss her so much. I’ve been crying since yesterday until I fell asleep'

Police learned ten minutes after Soza was shot that an unidentified woman had entered the Clam House restaurant shot and covered in blood.

She directed an employee to a dead body that lay outside the restaurant in a bullet riddled Audi.

That man, 38-year-old Donte Glenn, had previously survived a shooting in which he was shot in the buttock at age 19.

Police have made no arrests in either case and are, at least for now, treating them as separate homicides.

The unnamed woman in the Clam House was expected to recover. 

A blood-soaked shooting victim hobbled into this San Francisco restaurant around ten minutes after Soza's shooting. She pointed an employee to a dead man in a bullet riddled Acura outside. Police are now investigating whether the shootings were related
