Theresa May has replaced Boris Johnson as favourite to become the next Tory leader, according to a poll of party members.

The survey by influential grassroots website ConservativeHome reveals the Home Secretary has beaten the London Mayor into pole position for the first time, after a series of tough interventions on immigration.

Of the 800 Tory members polled last month, 22.7 per cent said Mrs May should be the party’s next leader, just ahead of Mr Johnson on 22.6 per cent.

Other contenders include the Education Secretary Michael Gove, who has repeatedly ruled himself out, on 17 per cent and former leadership contender David Davis on 11 per cent.

Despite the economic recovery, just 7 per cent of Tories believe Chancellor George Osborne should succeed David Cameron.

But the most startling finding in the poll, one of a regular series by the website, is the growing support for Mrs May whose proportion of the vote has never previously risen above the mid-teens.

Paul Goodman, a former Tory MP who edits ConservativeHome, said the results were ‘rather surprising’, given the Government’s problems over immigration.

He added: ‘The best explanation is that May’s reputation as an effective, focused and no-nonsense minister continues to grow among party members.’

The Prime Minister's satisfaction rating remains at 21 per cent

Mrs May is regarded as having had a good year, culminating in the deportation of hate preacher Abu Qatada in July last year.

She has also flaunted her Right-wing credentials with a number of toughly worded interventions on immigration and human rights.

The Home Secretary has refused to rule out standing for leadership in the future, while stressing that she remains loyal to the Prime Minister.

The emergence of Mrs May as a serious challenger is a significant setback for Mr Johnson, who has spent years courting party activists.

It follows controversy in November when he suggested that attempts to tackle inequality were ‘futile’ because some people were simply not bright enough to ever get ahead in life.

Delivering the annual Margaret Thatcher lecture in London, Mr Johnson also hailed the ‘spirit of envy’ – comments which drew widespread criticism.

The survey of party members also revealed that Mr Gove and the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith remain the most popular Cabinet ministers, with net satisfaction ratings of 83 per cent and 76 per cent.

Satisfaction with Mr Osborne rose dramatically last year as the economy recovered – up to 58 compared to a rating of minus one 12 months ago.

But the Prime Minister’s  satisfaction rating remains at just 21 per cent.

Mr Goodman said: ‘While Cameron takes the flak for what members see as the leadership’s errors – Romanian and Bulgarian entry, onshore wind farms, same-sex marriage, the growth of UKIP, compromises with the Liberal Democrats – Osborne takes the credit for the recovering economy.’
