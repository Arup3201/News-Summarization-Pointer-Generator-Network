The California home of a Christian pop singer was spared in wildfires that consumed parts of San Diego County last week, and, naturally, she's chalking it up as a miracle.

'It’s a total miracle ’cause the wind changed right when the fires were about to take over our house,' Christian singer Rebecca St. James wrote in a Facebook post accompanying a photo of the charred landscape that ends just feet from her patio.

St. James and her family were forced to evacuate the home on Wednesday as the flames approached her neighborhood.

Miracle: Rebecca St. James posted this photo on Facebook that shows just how close her home came to being torched by wildfires

'We may have lost our house and everything we own to a fire today… I saw
 the 2 story flames a few hundred yards away,' St. James wrote on Facebook after she was forced to evacuate on Wednesday. 'Please 
pray for us. I got out with [my baby daughter], our dog and a baby book 
in the car when police were arriving ordering evacuation.'

On Thursday, however, St. James posted another update about how the fire had 'miraculously' spared her family's home.

The photo St. James posted along with the news of the purported miracle shows the charred ground that stops just feet from her home - indicating that the fire nearly reached her property but then shifted.

'You can see the proof when you look at where the fire stopped, 3 feet 
from our back fence. The fire was a 2-3 story wall of flame, only meters
 away from our home!' she posted on the social networking website.

Additional evacuations were ordered on Thursday, with about 21,000 people being forced to leave their homes because of the widlfires.

Several California State University students were amongst those forced to evacuate - even as the students were in the middle of finals week. 

California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in San Diego County as fires have scorched more than 20,000 acres.

On Friday, authorities announced that a man had been arrested for arson in connection to the wildfires.

San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis identified the man charged as Alberto Serrato, who authorities say added brush to an already burning fire in the San Luis riverbed area.

'Citizens were there and observed this,' and two citizens notified police, who then made an arrest, she said.

Serrato faces up to seven years in prison if he's convicted.
