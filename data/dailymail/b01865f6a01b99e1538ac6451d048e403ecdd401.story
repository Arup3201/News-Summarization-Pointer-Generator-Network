Peter Wright had to fight back the tears during victory over Ronny Huybrechts in the second round of the World Darts Championship on Saturday.

The 2014 finalist and No 5 seed was overcome with emotion at the support he received from the crowd at Alexandra Palace on his way to a 4-1 win against his Belgian opponent.

With the score at 1-1, Wright hit a 144 checkout in the first leg of the third set and followed up with a 121 finish in the next and never looked back from there.

He said: ‘I found it hard work because the whole crowd started singing my name and I started to get tears in my eyes because the support I got was crazy.

‘I was trying to fight back the emotions to concentrate on my game and it was really hard. To have a couple of thousand people singing my name made me think “why are you doing this?”

Wright, who averaged 95.52, added: ‘I didn’t perform as well. I came out feeling fantastic and then the crowd started singing and I started welling up - I couldn’t concentrate.

‘But I’m still in the tournament. A bit of experience and that crazy crowd got me through.’

Robert Thornton, meanwhile, became the first man into the third round when he brushed aside Ronnie Baxter 4-0 in the opening match of Saturday’s afternoon session.

The No 9 seed, who averaged 93.78, was efficient in booking his place in the last 16 as he dropped just four legs.

Thornton raced to the first set before hitting double 12 in the deciding leg of the second to open up a two-set lead.

And the Scot almost put the icing on the cake with a nine-dart finish in the fourth leg of the third set, but he broke down after seven perfect darts before returning to hit double 16 to take the set.

After rounding off a 4-0 victory, Thornton said he prepared for the noise at Alexandra Palace by letting his grandchildren into his practice room.

‘My grandchildren can make a lot of noise,’ he said.

Thornton added: ‘In some of the legs I had chances and missed a couple of doubles. 

'Usually Ronnie doesn’t miss many doubles but it was good for me and I’m happy to be through to the third round. Overall I’m pretty happy, I just need to brush up on my finishing over the weekend.’

Terry Jenkins also came close to a nine-dart finish during his 4-0 win over Laurence Ryder.

The No 16 seed was in sublime form as he averaged 96.45 and hit two ton-plus checkouts, including a 164, on his way to whitewashing his opponent.

And in the second leg of the second set, Jenkins hit eight perfect darts but saw his attempt at double 12 hit the outside of the wire denying him a nine-darter.

Jenkins said: ‘It went on the wire. I rushed it a bit and it was close anyway and could have gone in. I should have taken my time.

‘All I’ve been doing at home is practicing 180s and 140s. I had a quiet Christmas at home and have been practicing for an hour every morning.

‘As long as I practice I know I can keep playing like that.’
