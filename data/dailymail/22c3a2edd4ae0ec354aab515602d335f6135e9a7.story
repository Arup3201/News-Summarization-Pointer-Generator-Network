You would have thought it was the World Cup final.

But these chanting football fans roaring on their team are actually watching an under-eights match.

Drunken supporters of top flight Polish club Lech Poznan gatecrashed a children's football game being played in a school sports hall in the western city of Poznan.

Unruly behaviour: Officials were forced to abandon the game, between local side Lecha and Kornik

Wielding flares, the yobs gathered in the upstairs viewing balcony and proceeded to behave as if they were in an outdoor stadium.

But as the match was being held in a small indoor arena, it quickly filled up with smoke.

The unruly behaviour forced officials to abandon the game, between local side Lecha and Kornik. The junior club of Lecha has links to Lech Poznan.

A four-minute video uploaded to YouTube shows the children seemingly unaffected by the boisterous fans.

They instead made themselves useful, running around collecting toilet roll that had been thrown onto the pitch.

Intimidating: The drunk yobs strip to the waist and jump up and down as smoke fills the small arena

Disgraceful: Footage of the incident has outraged YouTube users

The five-minute video has angered hundreds of internet users, who left comments on YouTube.

One fan, Fadbill2000, said: 'This is absolutely crazy. Those kids should have been cleared out by their coaches and all those fans with flares should be carted off in a police van.'

Another internet user, CalculatingInfinit6, said: 'I'd hate to imagine what the supporters for the senior team are like.'

Poland are joint hosts of Euro 2012, 
along with the Ukraine. It is the first time either country has hosted 
the tournament, which starts in June.

Lech Poznan fans are well-known for their boisterous behaviour.

Their goal celebration, in which fans bounce up and down with their arms locked and their backs turned to the pitch, is taking Europe by storm.

Called the Poznan, it has been adopted by Premier League side Manchester City.

Not what they were expecting: Smoke from flares slowly fills the arena as the bewildered children look
