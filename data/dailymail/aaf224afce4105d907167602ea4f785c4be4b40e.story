Paul Scholes has questioned Roy Hodgson's decision to deploy Jack Wilshere as a holding midfielder, insisting the Arsenal star is an 'attacking' player who 'is stuck between two roles' at the moment.

Wilshere was utilised in front of the back four for the Three Lions against Switzerland and Scholes feels that his talent is being misused and wasted due to both Hodgson and Arsene Wenger constantly switching the 22-year-old's role in the side.

Writing in his column in The Independent, former Manchester United and Three Lions midfielder Scholes said: 'I still have my concerns about the diamond formation in midfield (for England) and most of all about Jack Wilshere’s role in it.

Opinionated: Scholes (pictured) believes that Jack Wilshere's best role is as an 'attacking midfielder'

Strong: Wilshere has always been a player who can dive into a tackle, but can improve that part of his game

'Don’t get me wrong, Jack has great ability and at some point I hope that he will be in a position to score goals and to create them.

'But I just do not believe that playing in front of the back four, on his own, suits him.'

The 11-time Premier League winner also made comparisons between Wilshere and himself, believing both to be 'attacking' midfielders by nature.

Scholes claims Wilshere is being asked to play in an undefined role, almost a middle-ground between attacking and defensive midfield.

He continued: 'Wilshere is an attacking midfielder, as I was for most of my career. He is not a defensive midfielder and I feel at the moment he is stuck between the two roles. He is being asked to control the play from a deep position, which does not play to his strengths.'

Attributes: Arsene Wenger believes his midfield man has the abilities to play further back

Improving: The Arsenal midfielder was happy with his first game in the position, but wants to get better

Versatile: The Arsenal man can play in any of the three central midfield positions at his club
