Sydney to Hobart yacht race competitors fished aviation headphones and an aircraft headrest out of the sea near where a light plane crashed into water in southeast Tasmania.

Two men - pilot Samuel Peter Langford, 29, from Mount Nelson and photographer Timothy Peter Jones, 61, from Hobart - were on board the single-engine Cessna when it plunged into waters off the Tasman peninsula about 6.20pm on Monday.

They had been taking photos of race yachts on the approach to Hobart, Tasmania.

Police commander Tony Cerritelli said the plane was flying in less than ideal weather conditions and was just 300 metres from a race competitor when it went down.

'It was flying at around mast level and plunged nose-first into the water,' he said on Tuesday.

Race competitor Mistraal radioed for help as it rushed to where crew members saw the plane's tail disappear beneath the waves.

The Mistraal team sent a mayday call, which has appeared on social media.

'Mayday, mayday, mayday. We have a plane in the water. Plane in the water at 43 14 147 50. This is Mistraal. Mistraal,' it said.

The crew then radioed to say they were at the crash site.

An oil slick has been found in the area and there is still oil coming to the surface, marine rescue services inspector Lee Renshaw said.

A few 'unique' items have also been retrieved.

Owner and skipper Simon Kurts and his Sydney to Hobart yacht Love and War is reportedly helping to search for the plane

'It's a headrest, a set of headphones and a cover off one of the earpieces on aviation headphones with a boom microphone,' Insp Renshaw said.

However, there has been no sign of the plane or the men as an extensive search continues.

Waters in the area are up to 90 metres and too deep for divers.

Police boats are using sonar and Insp Renshaw insisted the operation remains a search, not a recovery operation.

'We are pretty confident we can pinpoint the location of the aircraft.'

Three-time winner Love & War joined in the initial search, along with Mistral, Enchantress, Inner Circle, Helsal III and Wax Lyrical. 

The crash is thought to have happened around 30nm from the race finish in the Derwent River in Hobart

Two Ambulance Tasmania helicopters continued the search on Tuesday morning, just after 6am. 

A statement from race organiser, Cruising Yacht Club Of Australia commodore John Cameron, said: 'We know of several yachts that were in the vicinity that may have diverted to render assistance.'

The Cessna 172 is owned by Airlines of Tasmania, the ABC reports.

The managing director of Airlines of Tasmania, Shannon Wells, said there were two people on board the plane 'which was conducting aerial photography of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race'.

'At this time our thoughts are with the families of the persons on board,' he told the ABC.
