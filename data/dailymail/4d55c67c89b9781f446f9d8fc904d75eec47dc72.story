Michael van Gerwen turns up bleary-eyed and takes a moment to finish his coffee before trying to focus his mind on Sergio Aguero’s helicopter, his ambition to own more houses than Phil Taylor and playing darts with Ron Vlaar.

It is 11am, but the reigning world darts champion takes a good 10 minutes to compose himself.

‘It’s too early,’ the 25-year-old Dutchman calls across the room. It is clear, early on, that this is going to be a very unusual interview.

Van Gerwen, who is preparing to defend his world title, eventually ambles over. I ask about the story of him tiling Dennis Bergkamp’s roof when he was an apprentice, before his darts career took off in his late teenage years.

‘That’s not true,’ he says. ‘I was doing his neighbour’s house. I’ve never met Dennis Bergkamp. I’ve met a lot of footballers, but not Dennis Bergkamp.

‘I speak to Ron Vlaar regularly. Tim Krul has been to the darts a couple of times. Robin van Persie likes darts. It’s nice and it’s good for the sport. It doesn’t make a difference to me — I just want to do well for the ones who’ve paid for the tickets,’ he adds in his thick Dutch accent, laughing loudly.

Van Gerwen befriended his compatriot Vlaar, the Aston Villa and Holland defender, when he was at a Premier League darts match in Birmingham.

He reveals that Vlaar has a dartboard hanging on a door in his house and marks on the side whenever people throw 180s or finish with a score over 100.

Van Gerwen doesn't think Phil Taylor's haul of 16 world titles will ever be matched

‘I went there for practice and a bit of a chat and he was marking all these things down for me on his door,’ Van Gerwen recalls.

‘I play a bit of darts and snooker with him. He plays quite well. I’ve played with a couple of footballers. Ron Vlaar and Rafael van der Vaart are the best.’ Now, when Van Gerwen is competing in the Midlands, he meets Vlaar for a coffee or they play darts and snooker together.

‘He won the last time we played snooker,’ Van Gerwen adds, looking slightly annoyed. ‘It’s always a tight game because we’re both rubbish. I’m no Ronnie O’Sullivan. He’s never taken a game off me in darts, though.’

Van Gerwen is the world No 1 and is something of a sensation in the sport. By 17 he had become the youngest player to win the World Masters and throw a televised nine-dart finish.

Van Gerwen has made a sensational rise in recent years having endured a tough spell

But he went through a tough spell until two years ago, when he began to zoom up the rankings from 38 and became the youngest person to win the World Championship last year aged 24, a title he will defend at London’s Alexandra Palace when the tournament starts on Thursday.

Consider that 16-time world champion Taylor — ‘The Power’ — did not break through until he was 29, it is some achievement. It is why World Cup footballers come to watch him play.

But Van Gerwen does not believe Taylor’s record world-title haul can ever be matched because there are now so many high-quality players on the circuit. He has, however, thought of another way to catch him.

‘I was living with my parents two-and-a-half years ago and now I have two houses,’ he explains. ‘I’m going to try to build it up. Trying to catch Phil, he’s got a bit more. He’s got about 12 houses.

‘I’ve done all the hard work to get in this position. That’s why I’m strong . . . ’ He tails off, pausing to consider how best to explain.

‘I need to think how to put this. It’s too early,’ he repeats. I point out that it is now 11.30.

‘You don’t know the life of a darts player,’ he says. ‘I was up late last night, I went to the Football Supporters’ Federation awards. William Hill sponsor them as well as the World Darts Championship.’

After a moment, he forgets the point he was making. I mention that Sergio Aguero was there to pick up the FSF player of the year award. ‘With a helicopter,’ he adds. ‘I don’t have a helicopter yet. Argentina lost the World Cup final, he’s not even world champion.’

Sky Sports will show the William Hill World Darts Championship exclusively live on the Sky Sports Darts channel starting next Thursday.
