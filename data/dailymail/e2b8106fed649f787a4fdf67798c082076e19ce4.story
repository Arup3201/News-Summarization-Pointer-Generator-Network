Jose reverts to type

I was watching Jose Mourinho throughout the game and every time Chelsea went forward he was screaming at Nemanja Matic and Ramires: ‘Get back, get back!’ 

He brought on Gary Cahill and Ruben Loftus-Cheek and he clearly had decided that the one goal was all they would get. And as such, it was a building block on the way to the title.

To me they looked much more like the Chelsea of last season: solid but lacking the creativity in midfield they have had this season. That, of course, was because they were missing Cesc Fabregas as much as Diego Costa.

I think City probably have the best squad and Chelsea have the best starting XI in the League. Mourinho hasn’t shaken City off and his team looked tired and vulnerable to injury and suspensions. I still think Chelsea will win the title but there are signs to give City hope.

Will City rue their missed chance?

Manchester City were more solid than normal to start with, as though they were expecting a real contest. Yet by the end there was only one team going for it. I’ve played in those games where you gear yourself up, expecting a really hard game. And when it doesn’t turn out that way, you can be kicking yourself.

That’s how I think City will feel. By the time they realised the game was there for the taking, it was too late and Chelsea were set in their defensive mode. I think they lacked a little bit of ambition to win the game.

There is still a long way to go and the important thing is that now they stay in touch with Chelsea until Easter — they can’t allow that gap to grow. But at the end of the season, they may look back at this one and rue their missed chances.

The missing man

Might Yaya Toure have made the difference in those final 15 minutes? I thought this was one of the best displays from Fernando and Fernandinho. They were brilliant in stifling Eden Hazard, Oscar and Willian. Apart from Hazard’s cross for the goal, we didn’t see anything of those three.

But you just wonder if Toure, who is at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast, with his strong personality and his physical strength, might have driven them on at the end. Big men win you big games.

When Branislav Ivanovic went forward, Sergio Aguero would pull into that left-hand channel. It was a really good tactic but every time he did, City didn’t have a runner who could burst through the middle. Toure would have relished that. Or even Frank Lampard. If they had been really brave and brought him on earlier, it might have just given them that edge.

Is Zouma the new partner for Terry?

Kurt Zouma looks like a player Jose Mourinho will trust in big games. He’s only 20 years old but he’s picked him against Liverpool and Manchester City, when they were facing quick attackers in Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero.

Mourinho obviously feels he needs that extra pace alongside John Terry and in those two you have a perfect mix: the big strong organiser alongside the quicker, sharper man. Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand were exactly that and it’s a classic defensive partnership.

I watched him a lot at St Etienne last season and he’s probably the quickest centre-back in the League. He’s raw at times and just needs to fine-tune his game. He probably will make mistakes but he looks to have won Mourinho over.

Chelsea will kick on with Juan Cuadrado

I’m a massive fan of Juan Cuadrado and I think we’re about to see an even better Chelsea side when he joins. Saturday’s tactics were dictated by the loss of Costa and Fabregas. 

I think Mourinho has concluded he is short of players to come in and he is over-reliant on his first XI. That is why Cuadrado could give them the decisive lift.

I first saw him playing for Colombia a year ago and I could not believe his running power. You think Willian runs hard, but this lad is something else. He runs box to box and he’s a typical Mourinho signing. 

He will double up and defend but will pop up in the box 30 seconds later. He will fit into the Chelsea philosophy. It’s maybe a signing that will push them towards the title.
