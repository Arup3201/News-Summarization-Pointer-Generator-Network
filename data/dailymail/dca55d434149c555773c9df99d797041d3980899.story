A demolition company has decided that the best way to tear down buildings is one brick at a time - even when that building is a 45 metre high chimney.

The firm, which knocks down buildings in the city of Taiyuan in north China, believes - so long as you are not in a rush - it is more economical to have a single man hammering out the bricks one by one than it is to shell out for explosives.

Company boss Chung Lei explained that he is able to offer the firm's  demolition services at a knock-down price as his methods are so cheap.

The Chinese demolition company believes that - so long as you're not in a rush - it is more economical to have a single man hammering out the brinks one by one than it is to shell out for explosives

He said: 'If you are looking at demolishing anything here you need to spend a fortune for the explosives and the license to use them, as well as demolition experts and all sorts of insurances against making any mistakes.

'In contrast you can also do it with one man and a hammer, it takes longer, but if there is no rush then you save a fortune.

Lei says that he has a dozen workers knocking down buildings across the city in Shanxi Province and business is booming.

The chimneys were no longer in use and needed to be removed, but the other buildings around still in use could not be damaged. So Chung Lei's firm demolished them carefully and slowly

He added: 'In the latest job the staff tackled a stack of 45 metre high chimneys was able to offer a knockdown price compared to other demolition firms that offer to do it with explosives. 

'The chimneys were no longer in use and needed to be removed, but the other buildings around still in use could not be damaged.

'For an explosives expert that's a specialist job and it means a lot of money, for me I just need to get another couple of lads and had them a hammer and a rope, and come back in a month to collect the cash.'
