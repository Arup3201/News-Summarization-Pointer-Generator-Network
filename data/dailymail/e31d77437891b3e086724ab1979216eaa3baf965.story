Despite reports that the property market has been booming in recent months with prices on the up, new figures from recent months indicate otherwise.

According to new data released by realAs, some vendors have slashed their asking prices by up to 40 per cent. Nationwide prices were down by an average of 2.7 per cent from December to February.

'There are various reasons for vendors reducing theirs asking prices, the primary one is that buyers are not willing to pay the price the vendor is asking,' Josh Rowe, CEO of realAs told Daily Mail Australia.

The cosy property has a very 70s feel to it, with it's red brick exterior and interior furnishings, but could easily be updated by changing the decor.

Mr Rowe pointed to a number of other properties across the country which had also knocked a substantial amount off their asking price, and said there are a number of underlying reasons for why this had happened.

'(One reason is) vendors having committed themselves to another purchase & needing to sell to cover their new debt/commitment.' 

Mr Rowe also said that agents having a higher expectation of what markets are willing to pay, and changes of employment conditions within a region can also contribute to the change in the market.
