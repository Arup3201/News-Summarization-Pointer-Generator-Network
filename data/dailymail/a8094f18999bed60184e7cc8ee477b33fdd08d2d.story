The next time the owner of this fake ID decides to travel under an assumed identity, he might choose a less high-profile alter ego.

German Lucas Baier, 27, flashed this driving licence - bearing the name and photograph of Russian president Vladimir Putin - at shocked ticket inspectors during a routine check on a train in southern Bavaria.

Inspectors immediately confiscated 
the fake licence from Russian-speaking Mr Baier, who said he bought it 
in a Russian market as a joke after his friends teased him about his 
resemblance to Putin.

The licence purported to have been 
issued in Latvia, and was passed to authorities in the country who 
confirmed it was a 'realistic forgery', a report in the Telegraph said.

Any suggestion the licence had ever 
been owned by Putin himself was dismissed by transport authorities in 
Latvia, who said 'no driving licence was ever issued to the Russian 
president'.

Mr Baier 
was travelling by train from Salzburg to Munich when he was asked to 
produce ID. He explained that he bought the fake licence after being 
constantly compared to the Russian leader.

'I was always being ribbed about it,' he said.

'On holiday I saw a realistic looking driving licence in his name, so I snapped it up.'
