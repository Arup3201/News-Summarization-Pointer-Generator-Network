This is the brave little girl who is battling through a massive birthmark.

Matilda Callaghan was born with the birthmark which stretches down from her face, down the side of her body.

Strangers have even asked her parents if they have left her too near the radiator and burnt her, when they see her for the first time.

But brave Matilda, two, doesn't let the regular laser treatments dampen her fighting spirit.

Parents Paul and Rebecca Callaghan said they did not think Matilda would live for more than a few hours. This month they are looking forward to celebrating her third birthday

Father Paul, 45, who lives in Leigh, Lancashire, with wife Rebecca, 41, said: 'Matilda is absolutely amazing.

'Despite everything she has been through, she is still happy and she has a smile for everyone. She's doing fantastically well.'

The couple had no idea there was anything wrong with Matilda before she was born in October 2010, weighing a healthy 5Ib 5ozs.

Her father described her as a fighter adding that 'She's our little miracle '

Mrs Callaghan's pregnancy hadn't been easy as there was too much fluid in her amniotic sac, and the doctors decided to deliver the baby early.

When she was born she had a dark purple mark down the side of her face, which initially doctors thought was a bruise.

But then half an hour later, they broke the devastating news to the couple that it was a birthmark.

Two weeks later she was diagnosed with a condition called Sturge Weber Syndrome, a rare neurological and skin disorder. It causes learning difficulties, paralysis and seizures.

Because she was so ill, Matilda was rushed from Wigan Hospital to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool.

Paul
 said: 'We couldn't travel with her as she was so ill. As we stood 
watching her being taken away, we didn't know if we were going to see 
her again.

'We'd been so excited at our baby's 
arrival, now within a matter of hours we didn't know whether we would 
even see her alive again.'

But
 even from a day old, Matilda was a force to be reckoned with. She had 
also been born with two holes in her heart, which was even more 
difficult for her survival.

She
 managed to survive her first surgery, and when she was two months old 
she went to the operating theatre again for surgery to repair the two 
holes in her heart.

Paul 
said: 'We were terrified when she was wheeled down for the surgery - 
even though she was two months old - she still looked so small to be 
having such major surgery. Eventually the surgeon came up to see us and 
told us the surgery had been successful.'

The
 doctors have said take Matilda's birthmark may take 16 years of 
treatment for it to fade. She has recently started laser treatment to 
stop it carrying on growing as she gets older.

Paul said: 'She has treatment every 
couple of months, and the laser does make it look more red and angry, 
and her face is covered with blobs afterwards, which then gradually fade
 away again.

'We do get people staring at Matilda when she goes out - especially after she's had the laser treatment - which is hurtful.

'We have even had people accusing us of leaving her to near the radiator, and causing her face to go red.

'People think we are the bad parents - that we have somehow caused Matilda to look like she does.

'They just see what is in front of them and jump to hurtful conclusions.

'I wish they could see past the birthmark and see what a wonderful little angel she is.

'She's always got a smile for everyone but she'd feisty too. It's her way or not at all.

'She can't see very well as the condition also causes glaucoma, which can cause blindness.

'The doctors can't tell us whether she will ever be able to see.

'And she can't walk at all. But recently we have bought a special walking frame, so she's taking her few steps in that.

It does worry me how Matilda is going to cope as she grows older.

'Other children can be so cruel and I want them to be able to see past the birthmark too. Matilda is such a special person in our lives, and every day with her is a bonus.

'Recently she said "mummy" for the first time, and it was such an emotional moment. We know that her whole life has been such a fight for her. She can point to her dummy too, so she's learning to communicate more.

'She'll be celebrating her third birthday this year, and it will be such a celebration for us. When she was born, we didn't even know whether she would survive a few hours.

'But she's proved everyone wrong. She was a fighter from the moment she arrived into the world and she's carried on fighting ever since. She's our little miracle. '

The couple are fundraising for Alder Hey Children's Hospital where Matilda was treated, and the Sturge Weber Foundation UK.
