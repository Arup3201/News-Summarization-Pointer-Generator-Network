Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has a body most of us can only dream of possessing - until now.

Bodyism, the lifestyle brand that Rosie swears by, has just launched a delivery service offering all the food and supplements that the supermodel lives on.

Rosie, 27, religiously follows Bodyism's Clean & Lean diet, which is made up of lean light proteins, simply cooked, and foods that are unprocessed and close to the way nature made them.

Although it's loved by supermodels, including Lara Stone and Elle Macpherson, the diet promises that it can work for anyone, 
from housewives to office workers and everyone in between.

Will it make us look like her? Rosie Huntington-Whiteley religiously follows the Clean & Lean diet, which is made up foods that are unprocessed and close to the way nature made them - and now they've launched a daily delivery service

And now, the company has joined forces 
with healthy food delivery service, The Detox Kitchen, to deliver a daily 1,800 calorie meal plan and 
supplement range that the likes of Hugh Grant, Rosie and Gwyneth Paltrow
 may eat on a daily basis.

Including muesli for breakfast, juices throughout the day, 
and king prawns with a quinoa, mixed pepper and spring onion salad for dinner, the creators say that this is designed to boost your energy levels, encourage healthy weight management and improve your general wellbeing.

The delivery service aims to make healthy living more accessible for time-poor Londoners and each day's menu promises to be wheat, dairy and refined sugar-free.

Other dishes include lentil and roasted sweetcorn salad with salmon, king prawns and green papaya and mange tout salad, as well as chicken burger (the virtuous kind, of course) with courgette noodle salad.

Each daily delivery also comes with a serving of recommended Bodyism supplements.

The supplements include Beauty Food - a daily elixir of super greens and marine collagen peptides - and Serenity, a calming combination of chamomile, hops and lavender to promote restful sleep.

The only downside? Looking and living like Rosie doesn't come cheap. A day's worth will set you back £42.99.

James Duigan and his wife 
Christiane are the brains behind the vastly 
successful Bodyism brand, which comprises smart gyms in London, The 
Maldives and Turkey, Clean & Lean books, a health-supplement range 
plus the company’s Brazilian Body Collection of workout wear.

Oh, and they've helped whip the likes of Elle Macpherson, Hugh Grant and David Gandy into shape too.

James' most recent project was teaming up with supermodel Lara Stone to pen the Clean & Lean 
Pregnancy Guide, which he co-wrote with former 
Grazia health editor, Maria Lally, and bills itself as 'the healthy way 
to exercise and eat before, during and after pregnancy'.

He called on good friend and 
client Lara to write the foreword for his latest book, which features 
gentle, safe exercises, illustrated with step-by-step photographs, for 
every stage of your pregnancy.

There
 are specific exercises designed to get rid of your 'mum tum', healthy 
eating dos and don'ts, plus advice on the best choices when eating out 
and tips on dealing with cravings.

The
 book also includes flexible meal plans, healthy recipes and advice on 
life post-baby, including getting enough sleep, recovering lost energy 
and what to eat when breastfeeding.

What does it take to look this good? James 
Duigan and his model wife Christiane have established the hugely 
successful Clean & Lean empire, but what do they eat themselves? The
 power couple have revealed all

Speaking about the new delivery service, British Dietetic Association spokesperson Sioned Quirke said: 'It seems like some of the meals are balanced and some don't seem to be, especially with regards to carbohydrates.

'Including the main food groups - protein, carbohydrate and fruit and veg at each meal will ensure we get a variety of the essential nutrients to prevent deficiencies.

'If we don't have carbs at each meal we can become low in energy. We don't promote the use of supplements, unless prescribed by a health care professional, as we should get all the nutrients we require from our diet. Our bodies use nutrients derived by food more effectively.

'I would also promote physical activity as a part of a healthy lifestyle and weight loss. The price is certainly enough to put people off - just stick to a healthy balanced diet, portion control and exercise for long tern success.'
