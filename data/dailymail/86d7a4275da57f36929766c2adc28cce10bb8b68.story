'African-American lives matter': Tracy Martin, father of Trayvon Martin, spoke out against the stigma surrounding young black men on MSNBC last night

The father of Trayvon Martin, the boy shot dead in Florida in 2012, last night spoke out against the stereotypes that stigmatise young blacks in America.

Speaking about the shooting of Michael Brown nine days ago at the hands of a policeman in Ferguson, Missouri, Tracy Martin told MSNBC he recognised attempts to smear the dead teenager's name.

Trayvon was just 17 when he was killed by neighbourhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder after his lawyers painted Trayvon as a dope-smoking, school-skipping delinquent.

Speaking after police in Ferguson released footage of Brown allegedly robbing a liquor store, Mr Martin said: 'You ask yourself as a parent... is my son on trial or is his killer on trial?'

'I'm seeing the same elements in this case.' As he spoke, Mr Martin's face was etched with sadness despite insisting his family were 'doing well'.

Asked by MSNBC's Alex Witt how a solution can by found to the 'alienation' felt by many in the black community, he said: 'We have to understand that as an African-American community our young kids get stereotyped a lot and we have to break the stigma.

'We have to come together as human beings and say that African-American lives matter as much as any other ethnicity group matters.'

Mr Martin's comments were a sad reflection of the general opinion of many of the residents of Ferguson, a mainly black suburb of St Louis, who are increasingly asking questions about whether authorities leading the investigation into Brown's death can be trusted to make impartial findings.

After a week-long crackdown on protests in the town, which have turned violent as police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators, the Associated Press reports that grand jurors have begun hearing evidence to help them decide whether Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson is charged with a state crime for the August 9 killing.

The U.S. Justice Department is conducting a separate civil rights investigation, which could mean there are two decisions about whether to charge Wilson, who is white. 

The state's case is being overseen by St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch, who is white, and remains in charge despite mounting pressure to step aside.

There are some among local residents and black St. Louis area officials who believe Mr McCullogh, who has strong links to police, cannot be impartial.

In some other prominent cases — including the killing of Trayvon Martin — special state prosecutors have been appointed to determine whether to pursue charges.

That sometimes has occurred after the local authorities took no action.

But under Missouri law, it 'would be highly, highly, highly unusual' for a prosecutor to step aside merely because of racial tensions in a high-profile case, said Peter Joy, a Washington University law professor who directs the school's Criminal Justice Clinic. That's because in Missouri, 'the buck stops with the head prosecutor' in each county.

Missouri law allows two avenues for outside prosecutors. The local prosecutor can ask for help from the governor, who can appoint the state attorney general's office to the case, or a court can appoint a special prosecutor if the elected one has a conflict of interest.

Police shootings don't automatically qualify as conflicts of interest and often are handled by local prosecutors.

'Just because the case is really hot and really controversial would not be a reason why I would seek a special prosecutor,' said Eric Zahnd, a Kansas City-area prosecutor who is a past president of the Missouri Association of Prosecuting Attorneys.

Michael Brown was unarmed when he was shot at least six times by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The killing has sparked more than a week of protests and claims of police institutionalised racism 

Police say Brown failed to move out of the centre of the street when Wilson asked him to, and a scuffle ensued before he was shot. Witnesses say Brown had his hands up as Wilson fired multiple rounds.

Wilson, a six-year police veteran who had no previous complaints against him, has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting and the department has refused to comment on his whereabouts.

Associated Press reporters have been unable to contact him at any addresses or phone numbers listed under that name in the St. Louis area.

In the predominantly black suburb of Ferguson, where the shooting occurred, many residents say they have long been harassed and intimidated by the police department, which has just three black officers on its 53-member force.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police put the streets of Ferguson on lockdown, calling in reinforcements including armoured vehicles and stalking the streets toting shotguns and sniper rifles in military-style camouflage gear and body armour

Residents have been left furious by the heavy-handed response, and they also have no confidence in Mr McCulloch, who has been prosecutor since 1991.

'He's not going to prosecute the police officers,' said Robert Fowler, a 48-year-old electrician. 'In the ghetto ... every police officer, he's letting go free. They call it justifiable homicide.'

Part of the scepticism stems from McCulloch's past. He comes from a family of police officers, and when McCulloch was a 12 years old, his father was fatally shot while responding to a call in 1964.

Others point to a 2001 case, where McCulloch brought no charges against two officers who fired 21 shots into a vehicle, killing two black men during an attempted drug arrest.

A spokesman for Mr McCullogh told The Associated Press the prosecutor has no plans to step aside from the Brown case.

'The people of this county have placed their trust in me,' Mr McCulloch told TV station KMOV. 'I've been as fair and impartial and done as thorough of a job as we could.'

U.S. Representative William Lacy Clay Jr., St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley and state Senators Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Jamilah Nasheed — all of whom are black — have called on Mr McCulloch to consent to a special prosecutor.

Ms Nasheed started an online petition and got more than 15,000 signatures within two days seeking a special prosecutor.

'In the past, justice has not been achieved in these types of police shootings,' said Mr Clay, who represents the area. 'So I have no comfort with local-authority prosecution, the judicial system or even police conducting a thorough and conclusive investigation that delivers justice to family of Michael Brown.'

'Simply put: he has a natural bias,' Ms Chappelle-Nadal, the local state senator, said of Mr McCulloch. 'My community doesn't trust him.'

Missouri does have a recent case in which a special prosecutor took over a highly publicised case, although it was not a racially charged scenario.

Last October, a prosecutor in rural northwest Missouri asked a judge to appoint a special prosecutor after public concerns that he didn't do enough before dropping felony charges against a teenage boy accused of sexually assaulting a younger girl.

A judge appointed a Kansas City area prosecutor to take a new look at the case, and Matthew Barnett pleaded guilty in January to misdemeanor child endangerment.
