President Barack Obama presented a rose-colored version of congressional history to a liberal-leaning online audience on Monday, as he claimed that he was the most productive president since Jyndon Johnson until Republicans got in the way.

Asked by the news website Vox if he had a prescription for the political polarization of Washington since his arrival in 2009, he blamed the GOP. 

'You know,' he said, 'my first two years in office when I had a Democratic majority and Democratic House and Democratic Senate, we were as productive as any time since Lyndon Johnson.'

'And when the majority went away, stuff got blocked.'

NOSTALGIA: Obama pines for the good old days when his party ruled the roost in Washington, and says he was the most productive president since LBJ until the GOP got in the way

ACCOMPLISHMENTS: The Affordable Care Act was a 'big f*****g deal,' according to VP Joe Biden, but the ensuing controversy has left some Americans wishing Congress had passed fewer laws

The line about LBJ came from a December 2010 article in which The Washington Post said the outgoing Democrat-dominated federal legislature had 'passed more landmark legislation than any since the era of Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society".'

Congress passed, and Obama signed, a whopping 383 new laws in 2009-2010, and voters responded by sweeping Republicans into power in the House with 63 new seats and shrinking Democrats' majority in the Senate.

The tea party was alive and well, and the Obama presidency never again had an easy road on Capitol Hill.

Major initiatives like Obama's $787 billion stimulus spending bill, the much-derided 'Cash for Clunkers' car buy-back scheme and a law that put all student loan borrowing under Washington, D.C.'s control felt like Democratic wins in 2010, but have since lost their luster.

So has the Affordable Care Acre, Obama's signature achievement and the law that will define his legacy for good or for ill. 

Bits of the Dodd-Frank banking reform law have been chipped away since its birth in 2010.

And Democrats took credit for ending the Iraq war and withdrawing 100,000 troops back to the safety of the United States in that same year. 

But with the benefit of hindsight, Obama's critics have hammered him for failing to leave a residual military force behind – a force that might have prevented the rapid and rapacious growth of the ISIS terror army in cities once secured by Americans' blood.

'Congress and the administration simply failed to listen to the American people," said Ohio Rep. John Boehner at the time. 'Time and time again they yelled "stop," but the folks running Washington barreled ahead with a job-killing agenda our nation didn't want or need.'

Laws passed during those two years would fill more than 4,050 pages of new federal code. 

Boehner became Speaker of the House two weeks later and hasn't relinquished his hold on power since. 

The count of new laws passed in Boehner's first two years as speakers – that is, Obama's third and fourth in office – ratcheted down to 286 as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid began throwing up roadblocks to the upstart GOP on the other side of the U.S. Capitol.

Two years further down the road, in the Congress that concluded in December 2014, just 86 federal bills were signed into law. 

Obama suggested in his Vox interview, which was conducted last month, that Republicans have stymied his agenda and slowed down the march of progress.

OBAMA WEPT TOO: House Speaker John Boehner got emotional in January 2011 as outgoing speaker Nancy Pelosi passed him his ceremonial gavel after a tea party wave that swept 63 new Republicans to power

THE FINAL INSULT: Kentucky GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell now runs the Senate, leaving Democrats without any moorings in Congress during President Barack Obama's final two years in office

Reid, however, bears much of the responsibility.

In 2013 and 2014, a flood of House bills turned into a trickle in the Senate as he ran the upper chamber of Congress with an iron fist.

By October 2014, Boehner's House had passed as many as 387 bills that would never see a Senate vote, most of them with votes from both Republicans and Democrats.

Obama told Vox that eliminating 'the routine use of the filibuster in the Senate' would be a helpful development.

That maneuver allows any single senator to object to a vote that would end debate on a subject and put a question to the floor for a final vote.

Under such an objection, a supermajority of 60 is needed to proceed. Not since 1979 has either party held that many seats.

The result is often gridlock and slow deliberation, followed by a flurry of intense legislating as the end of a two-years session approaches.

'There's nothing in the Constitution that requires it,' Obama said. 'The framers were pretty good about designing a House, a Senate, two years versus six-year terms, every state getting two senators. There were a whole bunch of things in there to assure that a majority didn't just run rampant.'

'The filibuster in this modern age probably just torques it too far in the direction of a majority party not being able to govern effectively and move forward its platform,' he insisted.

Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the new majority leader, has taken a different approach from that of Reid, whom he displaced in January.

'DINGY HARRY': Sen. Harry Reid blocked hundreds of House bills in the last Congress and has been sidelined in the current session

Where Reid became Washington's chief individual obstructionist, McConnell has opened up the legislative process to Democrats' amendments on every bill.

It's not out of the goodness of his heart, however: In 2016 Republicans will have a tough time retianing control of the Senate since so many of the contested seats will be GOP-held, and in states where a Democratic presidential nominee would expect to do well.

By allowing his rank-and-file to vote in favor of liberals' amendments now and again – as long as they don't pass – he provides Republican senators with political cover that they'll need next year in order to keep their seats.

McConnell, like Boehner, wants to see Congress remain in the red column and elect a Republican president to work with them.

And then he – or she – could later claim to have been the most productive president since LBJ, at least until the pendulum swung back and 'stuff got blocked.'

'My first two years in office ... we were as productive as any time since Lyndon Johnson,' Obama said

Democrats ran both houses of Congress for Obama's first two years in office; the House fell to the GOP in 2010, and the Senate in 2014

As Republicans seized the reins in the House, Senate Democrats began blocking bills and the rate trickled to one-quarter what it had been

Much of what Congress passed in 2009 and 2010 has become intensely controversial: Obamacare, the stimulus, 'Cars for Clunkers' and others
