Domenico Rancadore, leaving court today, has been ordered to return to Italy after losing his battle against extradition

A Sicilian Mafia boss caught in London's suburbia after two decades on the run has been ordered to return to Italy after losing his battle against extradition.

Domenico Rancadore, also known as The Professor in mafia circles, fled to Britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in Italy for his role as a 'man of honour', taking bribes from builders in Palermo. 

But after spending 20 years holed up in Uxbridge, west London, the 65-year-old has been told he must return to his native country to serve a seven-year sentence for association with the organised crime syndicate. 

It comes after protracted extradition proceedings which saw a judge reverse his initial decision over concerns that Italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition.

Rancadore had spent a year and a half fighting extradition before Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle told the pensioner he had to leave the country.

He has seven days within which to lodge an appeal against the decision, after which he will be removed from the country within 10 days, an official at Wesminster Magistrates' Court said.

The mobster, who has been released on conditional bail, was first arrested on a European Arrest Warrant at his semi-detached home in August 2013.  

Although never convicted of murder, the Italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country, after he fled in 1995.

He was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his 'Mafia association'.

The ruling came after protracted extradition proceedings which saw Judge Riddle reverse his initial decision over concerns that Italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition.

But Rancadore was rearrested a month later and his wife Anne Skinner, known to the court as Mrs Rancadore, told the court of his deteriorating health and how he suffered from claustrophobia.

The mafia boss lived a double life in Uxbridge under the name Marc Skinner after arriving in Britain in the 1990s

Before his arrest in 2013, the Mafia don spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge, obscured from view.

He claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father, Giuseppe.

Rancadore's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 Mafiosi indicted.

In April Alun Jones QC, defending, made an abuse of process application, arguing that a case could not be brought against a defendant more than once.

But a new arrest had been issued, with the Italian authorities admitting the CPS had made a 'comical series of blunders' in relation to Rancadore's extradition.

Rancadore has seven days within which to lodge an appeal against the decision, after which he will be removed from the country within 10 days, an official at Wesminster Magistrates' Court said

The issues related to the late service of papers and the failure to inform Rancadore's counsel that assurances had been given by the Italian authorities regarding the prison he would be sent to.

In his judgment Judge Riddle said: 'It is sometimes said that extradition proceedings are criminal proceedings. In some ways they are, but in other ways they are not. An extradition court is not concerned with determining innocence or guilt.'

He concluded: 'I am satisfied that, even without the assurance, there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to Italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment.

'Whether the assurance of 14th March is in his interests, and whether he wishes to take advantage of it, are not matters for this court to consider.'

'I must order the extradition of Domenico Rancadore to Italy. He has seven days to appeal this decision.'

Also known as Cosa Nostra, which translates as 'Our Thing', the Mafia emerged in Sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct.

Groups, often known as families or clans, will claim leadership of an area, usually a town or village, and operate rackets within it, using violence to punish those causing problems to their 'clients' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection.

Most of the clans are led by a 'boss' (capofamiglia or rappresentante), who is aided by an underboss (capo bastone or sotto capo) and supervised by one or more advisers (consigliere).

Only men are allowed to join the clans, and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges.

It has been estimated that the Sicilian Mafia costs the region's economy more than €10 billion a year, and that roughly 70 per cent of Sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money.

Politicians have also been accused of using the Mafia to buy votes during elections.

The American Mafia arose from offshoots of the Cosa Nostra that emerged in the United States during the late nineteenth century, following waves of emigration from Italy.
