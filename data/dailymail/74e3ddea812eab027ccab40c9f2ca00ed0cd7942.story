The grandfather of the Jamaican beauty queen who lost out on the Miss Universe crown has hit out at the pageant judges for being unclear about the requirements needed to win the show.

Michael Fennell said that Kaci was the victim of ‘unwritten factors’ and that the judges should have stated if Miss Universe needed to have long hair.  

He said: 'If short hair is a problem why didn’t they say so in the contest?'

After beating out stiff competition from USA, Netherlands, Jamaica and Ukraine, Miss Colombia Paulina Vega (right) became Miss Universe 2015, but some seemed to think it was Miss Jamaica Kaci Fennel (left) who deserved the crown. Her family have now publicly criticised the decision and called on the pageant judges to be more transparent about their criteria

Mr Fennell continued: ‘In my mind she was absolutely beautiful in her short hair.

'She was different but if the judges didn't want short hair then say so. 

'I wish I knew how these contests were judged where there are other factors that are unwritten that have to be considered'.

He also criticised those who questioned his daughter’s claims that Jamaica’s contributions to the world are Usain Bolt and Bob Marley.

He  said: ‘Of course it’s Bob Marley and Usain Bolt...the answers of the other contestants did not answer the question’.

It's renowned for its swimwear round, stunning dresses and a seemingly never-ending array of beautiful women.

However, last night's Miss Universe final in Miami got hotter than ever - after Miss Colombia, Paulina Vega, 22, was controversially crowned the winner of the beauty pageant. 

Instead of the usual cheering, the audience erupted into boos of  disapproval as favourite-to-win Miss Jamaica Kaci Fennell only made it to fifth place.

Shortly after Miss Fennell, 22, left the stage in the 63rd annual contest, her name began trending on Twitter along with the hashtag #MissJamaicaShouldHaveWon.

 And the winner is: Miss Colombia Paulina Vega is crowned Miss universe 

Robbed? Miss Jamaica's striking good looks and unmistakable poise have left Miss Universe pageant viewers saying the 22-year-old was robbed after being named fourth runner-up

Unlike Miss Vega, who looks every-inch the beauty queen, Miss Fennell gained a large following due to her striking beauty, confidence intelligence and unconventional style - wearing her hair in a Halle Berry-esque pixie cut instead of the traditional long pageant waves.

Fans claim Miss Fennell was denied the title after she proudly called Usain Bolt, the world's fastest short-distance runner, and reggae-king Bob Marley her country's greatest contributions to the world.

'I don't have long tresses like everyone else, I'm just representing myself and that's what beauty pageants are all about,' said Fennell, who wore a long, red beaded evening gown. 'You don't have to look a certain way ... and I feel like I represent that.' 

Her non-traditional answers along with her pixie cut and Caribbean confidence, likely contributed to her not placing higher in the final, according to her fans. 

Too honest: Kaci Fennell called Bob Marley and Usain Bolt the greatest contributions her country has given the world--an unlikely answer in the minds of some, but others saw honesty in her answer that other contestants would be afraid to show

Winning competitor Miss Vega is from Barranquilla, Colombia and is studying business administration. She said that she isn't planning to enter any more Miss Universe beauty competitions as she's eager to return to her studies. The 22-year-old is the granddaughter of a legendary tenor, Gastón Vega.

Earlier she said, 'It will be a dream come true to represent the woman of today. A woman that not only cares about being beautiful and being glamorous, but also cares about being a professional, intelligent, hard-working person.'

Hot topic: Fans of Miss Jamaica took to Twitter and helped to make her a trending topic even more popular than Miss Universe herself

First runner-up was Nevada resident Miss USA, Nia Sanchez. Coming in third was second runner-up Miss Ukraine, Diana Harkusha. Miss Netherlands took the fourth spot as third runner-up.

The first beauty eliminated from the top 5 was Miss Jamaica, whose departure brought loud and unmistakable boos from the international audience.

All top five finalists had been individually serenaded with a song by singer Gavin DeGraw in the moments leading up to the big reveal in the competition, which had 88 contestants and was held in Miami.

Miss USA Nia Sanchez, 24, said she had been looking forward to the often-dreaded interview portion. In the week leading up to the final she had been practising answering questions with her roommate Miss Australia, Tegan Martin, who made it to the top ten.

Sanchez, a Nevada resident, has a fourth-degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and has traveled the country teaching others. She spoke about equipping women to defend themselves against crime.

'It's just something that's so prevalent in our society and why not empower women to take control of a dangerous situation into their own hand,' she said.

Big show: Today Show personality Natalie Morales was hosting the show. And before Miss Universe, Gabriela Isler of Venezuela, crowned the next winner, viewers were to hear performances from singers Nick Jonas and Prince Royce

In another moment of controversy, crowd favorite Miss Venezuela Migbelis Lynette Castellanos was cut after the top ten She had tremendous support both locally and back home.

The Miami suburb of Doral, which is hosting the women during their stay, is also known as 'Doralzuela' for its many Venezuelan residents. Three of the last six Miss Universe titles have gone to Venezuela, where beauty pageants are big business.

Explosive confrontations are nothing new for Israel and Lebanon, but the latest spat between the longtime foes is perhaps the first to have been caused by an alleged photo-bomb.

A seemingly innocuous selfie at the Miss Universe pageant in Miami has sparked criticism in Lebanon because it featured a smiling Miss Lebanon alongside Miss Israel. The Israeli beauty queen, Doron Matalon, posted a picture of herself with colleagues from Japan, Slovenia and Lebanon on her Instagram account. The result? A formal Lebanese investigation into the scandal.

Lebanese Tourism Minister Michel Pharon told The Associated Press that 'if there was bad intentions' from Saly Greige, measures could be taken against her. In her defense, Miss Lebanon says she was photo-bombed.

Matalon said the joint photo was genuine and was saddened that Greige was under fire at home.

'I hope for change and I hope for peace between us, and even just for three weeks, just between me and her,' she told NBC News. 'We need to remember that we represent the country and the people, not the government and not the political issues.'

Under fire from critics angered by her fraternizing with the enemy, Greige took to Facebook to defend herself.

'The truth behind the photo: Since the first day of my arrival to participate to Miss Universe, I was very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with Miss Israel (that tried several times to have a photo with me),' she wrote. 'Suddenly Miss Israel jumped in, took a selfie, and put it on her social media.'

In a statement, the Miss Universe Organization said 'it is unfortunate to know a photo of four smiling women from different parts of the world, working together at an event, could be misconstrued as anything other than what it is, a celebration of universal friendship.'

Neither Miss Israel nor Miss Lebanon made it to the competition's final round
