Diego Costa and Federico Fazio could reignite their rivalry after the Sevilla centre-back signed for Tottenham in a £8million deal on Wednesday.

Fazio and Costa were involved in a fight last season that culminated in the Chelsea striker being punched in the stomach.

The Brazilian-born forward pushed Fazio in the face during a match and the 27-year-old responded in similarly unpleasant fashion.

Remarkably, neither player was sent off as the referee appeared not to have spotted the incident, despite having a clear view of the pair.

But after Tottenham met Fazio's buy-out clause, the Premier League could be the scene for further trouble when the two players at Stamford Bridge in December.

Mauricio Pochettino had been interested in signing Villareal defender Mateo Musacchio but the deal fell through over third-party ownership issues. 

Fazio is the fifth defensive signing for Spurs this summer after the arrivals of Michel Vorm, Ben Davies, DeAndre Yedlin and Eric Dier.
