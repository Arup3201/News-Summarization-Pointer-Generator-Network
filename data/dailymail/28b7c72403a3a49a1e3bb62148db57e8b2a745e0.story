Facebook now has a staggering 1.4 billion users, but millions of these members don't realise they're using the internet when they access the site. 

When asked if they have the internet, and whether they use Facebook, people in Indonesia and Nigeria didn't make the connection between the two. 

In fact, one in 10 users in both regions denied having access to the web, but said they use Facebook daily.

Quartz commissioned the two studies to see how people perceive the concept of the web.

The findings go some way to confirm habits that were first reported by LIRNEasia in 2012.

Helani Galpaya at the think tank spotted a pattern of negative answers to questions about the web during qualitative interviews.

This suggested those asked weren’t web users, but the same people also admitted to using Facebook on their mobile.

LIRNEasia said at the time: ‘It seemed that in [the minds of users], the internet did not exist; only Facebook.’

During these interviews, in Myanmar, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand more people said they were Facebook users than internet users.  

Quartz commissioned Geopoll to survey a total of 1,000 people - 500 in each country - across Indonesia and Nigeria. More than one in 10 Indonesians said they use Facebook, but not the internet. In Nigeria, 9% of Facebook users said they aren’t on the web (shown in green)

The Quartz findings were inspired by, and go some way in confirming, habits that were first reported by LIRNEasia in 2012. During interviews carried out by the think tank in Myanmar, Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand, more people said they were Facebook users than internet users (as shown in this graph) 

To put this theory to the test, Leo Mirani at Quartz commissioned Geopoll to survey a total of 1,000 people - 500 in each country - across Indonesia and Nigeria. 

The surveys took place in December and were conducted over text message, so specifically targeted phone users.

Quartz commissioned Geopoll to survey a total of 1,000 people - 500 in each country - across Indonesia and Nigeria.

In Indonesia, 37 per cent of the respondents were female and 63 per cent were male. 

Ages were divided into three groups: 15 to 24-year-olds (37 per cent), 25 to 34-year-olds (39 per cent) and 35 and over (24 per cent).

In Nigeria, the gender split was 47 per cent female and 53 per cent male. 

The majority were in the lower age category (56 per cent), just over a third (34 per cent) were between 25 and 34, and one in 10 were 35 and older.

The surveys took place in December and were conducted over text message, so specifically targeted phone users.

Quartz additionally commissioned surveys in India, Brazil and Indonesia using Jana, and studied Americans online.

Participants were asked whether they had used the internet, and Facebook during the previous month, and if they agreed with the statement ‘Facebook is the internet.’

More than one in 10 Indonesians said they use Facebook, but not the internet.

In Nigeria, 9 per cent of Facebook users said they aren’t on the web.

Nigeria had the highest number of people (65 per cent) who believed Facebook is the internet, followed by 61 per cent in Indonesia.

More than half of Indian and Brazilian respondents (58 per cent and 55 per cent respectively) agreed with this statement compared to just five per cent of Americans.

Mr Mirani wrote: 'It would be silly to extrapolate this to the entire population of Nigeria or Indonesia. 

'But the survey does provide replicable evidence of the behaviours described by [LIRNEasia].

‘Considering the substantial percentages, the data suggest at the very least that a few million of Facebook’s 1.4 billion users suffer from the same misconceptions.’

A separate study from Flurry Analytics recently spotted a trend of people shifting away from the web browser in favour of apps.

During 2014, 86 per cent of people used apps to access web services, compared to just 14 per cent who used a mobile browser.

Gaming apps led the way on 32 per cent, and Facebook increased its share from 24 per cent to 28 per cent.
