Friends reveal that Bowe Bergdahl was discharged from the Coast Guard on account of a failed psychological exam two years before he enlisted in the Army and shipped off to Afghanistan.

Bergdahl sent a box containing his laptop and personal journals to a friend in Idaho shortly before he walked off the Army base in Afghanistan in 2009 and she has shared the concerning writings with The Washington Post.

Some of the more bizarre excerpts feature his rantings about the wisdom of the protagonist in Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged, his desire to learn Russian and 'Chines' and how he wanted to write a story about someone 'going-crazy-to wander the earth alone'.

'I’m worried... The closer I get to ship day, the calmer the voices are. I’m reverting. I’m getting colder. My feelings are being flushed with the frozen logic and the training, all the unfeeling cold judgment of the darkness,' he wrote in one entry shortly before his deployment.

Release: Bowe Bergdahl was exchanged for five detained Taliban leaders and now a friend has revealed that he failed a psychological examination in 2006, two years before he enlisted in the Army

Frequent misspellings and repeated references to voices inside his head are seen throughout the entries in a notebook and in various files on his computer.

'These thoughts insist on trying to overwhelm my mind... I’ve spent a lot of my life thinking blackness was all I had in front of me, that it would be blackness to the very last instent [sic]. I know this is not right. I know that there is light in this darkness, and that I can actuly [sic] reach it if I keep walking, keep moving to it.'

'Like i’m pulling away from the human world, but getting closer to people... Almost as if its not the people I hate, but society’s ideas and reality that hold them,' he wrote in a document called 'threw the mind'.

'I want to change so much and all the time, but then my mind just locks down, as if there was some one else in my mind shutting the door in my face... I want to pull my mind out and drop kick it into a deep gorge.'

Bergdahl, who was promoted to Sargeant during his five years in captivity, reportedly had a little-known history with the uniformed services before he enlisted.

Friends were shocked when the introspective teen, who took ballet and fencing lessons near his home in Idaho, told them that he wanted to join the Coast Guard.

Uncharacteristic: Bergdahl's friend from home in Idaho said that he does not look like his normal self in footage of the exchange

He was close with Kim Harrison, who ran the center where he took the recreational classes, and she was the one who drove him to take the Coast Guard exam even though she had initially told him about her reservations about the idea.

She was the one who Bergdahl later listed as his emergency contact in the Army who he designated should be sent his remains if he was killed in combat.

'These thoughts insist on trying to overwhelm my mind... I’ve spent a lot of my life thinking blackness was all I had in front of me, that it would be blackness to the very last instent [sic]. I know this is not right. I know that there is light in this darkness, and that I can actuly [sic] reach it if I keep walking, keep moving to it.'

She was also the one who he sent his box filled with his writings, as well as a copy of the libertarian favorite Atlas Shrugged and a pile of military records, which she has since shared with The Washington Post.

Ms Harrison, who spoke using her maiden name to avoid threats, said that she shared the information because she was concerned about the portrayal of Bergdahl as a cold, calculated deserter as opposed to how she viewed him: as a vulnerable young man with emotional issues.

His writings, which poetic longings to see the world and become a story teller to unexplainable repetitions of bizarre phrases, give the clearest picture to date of his mental state but the revelation of his history in the Coast Guard shows that there were external warning signs that were overlooked by the government.

The Washington Post checked Coast Guard records which show that Bergdahl left as a result of an 'uncharacterized discharge' following just 26 days of basic training.

Bergdahl reportedly told Ms Harrison and other friends that he had faked the exam but they did not believe him.

'He said he started to feign a psychological disorder, saying strange things to get out. I remember flat out calling him out on it— I said "there is something else going on." He said, "I chose to do it,"' an unidentified friend told The Post.

He announced that he had enlisted in the Army two years later. Normally the Army requires a waiver to be filed noting that they have approved the enrollment of individuals who have previously been discharged. One unidentified military official claimed that the Army was aware that Bergdahl had received an 'administrative discharge' in the past when he enlisted.

Inner thoughts: Bergdahl sent a box filled with his Apple computer, journal, military files and copy of an Ayn Rand book to a friend in Idaho and it arrived to her just days after he walked off the base

The Army could not immediately confirm or deny the issuance of a waiver.

He wrote about his feelings both before he left his Army training program in Georgia and while he was on the base in eastern Afghanistan.

'Really, how pathetic i feel as i listen to people talk of the hell I will be heading to,' he wrote in a document saved on his computer under the file name 'my army memories'.

'Compared to hell of the real wars of the past, we are nothing but camping boy scots. Hiding from children behind our heavy armored trucks and our c-wire and sand bagged operating post, we tell our selves that we are not cowards.'

One of his last known communications came a few weeks before he left the base on June 30, 2009.

He emailed Kim Harrison's daughter Kayla, who he had been close with, and told her not to worry if her mother 'gets a call from red cross' at any time in the future.

'You know what I do, and ash I am still perfecting, actions may become . . . odd. No red flags. Im good. But plans have begun to form, no time line yet. . . love you! Bowe,' he wrote.

Kayla was concerned and emailed back asking about the plans, and he replied in code: 'l1nes n0 t g00 d h3rE tell u when 1 ha ve a si coure 1ine about pl/-\ns'.

'There is still time yet for thinking,' he wrote the next day.

When she wrote back telling him not to 'do anything stupid or pointless,' he said 'you know I plan better then that'.
