Six friends were killed in a single avalanche during a black weekend in the Alps which also claimed the life of an international ski 'ambassador' from the USA.

The deadly period began on Friday when Dave Rosenbarger, a 38-year-old from Oregon, was caught in a tide of snow and ice on the Italian side of Mont Blanc.

Three friends who were with Mr Rosenbarger, who spent every winter in the nearby resort of Chamonix and was known as 'American Dave', looked on as he was buried.

They managed to dig him out, and he was airlifted by helicopter, said a local police spokesman, but 'he sadly died of his injuries in hospital.'

The next day – Saturday – four men and two women aged between 50 and 70 died in the Queyras valley, in the Haute-Alpes department.

The party had set off to ski the range, which also straddles France and Italy, but triggered a another massive slide.

Pierre Besnard, the Haute-Alpes prefect, said 'the bodies of three of the skiers were found overnight Saturday to Sunday', while the rest were recovered on Sunday morning.

All were French nationals, and had spent many years skiing, said Mr Besnard, who said rescue teams had worked tirelessly to try and find them.

A helicopter and rescue dogs were all involved in the emergency effort, with police saying an entire plate of compacted snow and ice had dislodged.

The skiers had begun their ascent by ski life in the resort of Ceillac, and they were found in Bacha valley, at an altitude of 2500 meters.

All had been expected back on Saturday, but the alarm was raised by relatives and friends when there was no sign of them.

'When they set off, the sky was clear and the risk of avalanche estimated at 3 out of 5', said Mr Besnard.

An investigation into the tragedy has been opened by the high mountain police Briancon, while surviving family of the deceased are receiving psychological care.

Two skiers, including a guide, were also found dead in the nearby Ecrins range, also in the Hautes-Alpes, on Thursday morning, after being swept away by an avalanche.

Mr Rosenbarger, who is survived by his wife, Rosanna Hughes, was an Ambassador for the Patagonia ski and snowboard manufacturer.

Company spokesman Josh Nielsen, said: 'He was the epitome of a pure passion skier—someone who didn't do it for the cameras or for the limelight—and was deeply committed to the sport for all of the right reasons.

'Dave was a calculated risk taker and a talented athlete who dedicated his life to climbing and skiing some of the most challenging lines in the world, especially in Chamonix, his winter home.'

Some 17 people have died in avalanches in France since the beginning of this season, with the number rising to 30 across the entire Alps range.
