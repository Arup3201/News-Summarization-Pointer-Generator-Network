Rickie Lambert's proposed move to Liverpool has raised a few eyebrows with the striker having turned 32 earlier this year.

The Southampton star has just enjoyed one of the best seasons of his career and is off to the World Cup with England, but some fans feel that his best years could be behind him.

With that in mind, Sportsmail looks at five other players who proved that age is nothing but a number after joining a new club in their thirties.

On the move: Southampton striker Rickie Lambert is set to join Liverpool for £4million this summer

Gordon Strachan - Manchester United to Leeds 1989, £200,000

Strachan appeared set to leave Old Trafford for Sheffield Wednesday before Leeds boss Howard Wilkinson convinced him to drop down into the second tier.

The Scot, who was 32 when he put pen to paper at Elland Road, proved to be an influential signing as he captained Leeds to the second division title in 1989-90 and became a popular figure among supporters.

Strachan helped Leeds finish fourth in their first season back in the top-flight and reach the semi-finals of the League Cup. He was duly voted as the Football Writers' Association Player of the Year in 1991 for his tenacious midfield displays.

After signing a new contract, Strachan went on to win the first division title with Leeds in 1991-92 to etch himself into the club's history books.

He represented the Yorkshire side for another two-and-a-half seasons before leaving to join Coventry City as a player and assistant manager.

Gary McAllister - Coventry City to Liverpool 2000, free transfer

McAllister was snapped up on a free transfer by Gerard Houllier in the summer of 2000 after his contract at Coventry came to an end.

At 35, some fans questioned his suitability to fit into Liverpool's dynamic starting XI. Those doubts didn't last for long.

The Scot shone in the heart of the Reds' midfield and his experience proved instrumental as Houllier's side won three cups in 2001.

Spot on: Gary McAllister scores a penalty in Liverpool's dramatic 5-4 UEFA Cup final win against Alaves in 2001

McAllister scored Liverpool's opening penalty in their shootout victory against Birmingham City in the League Cup final, before coming on as a substitute to help turn a one-goal deficit into a dramatic 2-1 win against Arsenal in the FA Cup final.

In the UEFA Cup final the following week, McAllister scored once and played his part in three more goals as Liverpool sealed a memorable 5-4 triumph against Alaves in Dortmund.

He stayed at Anfield for another season before joining Coventry as player-manager in the summer of 2002.

Experienced: McAllister helped Liverpool win three trophies during their memorable 2000-01 campaign

Teddy Sheringham – Portsmouth to West Ham United 2004, free transfer

After just one season at Portsmouth, Sheringham made the decision to drop down to the Championship and link up with Alan Pardew at West Ham.

Then 38, the former Manchester United striker defied his age to score 20 league goals and finish as the division’s third-highest scorer.

Sheringham’s impressive form helped the Hammers finish sixth and they secured promotion back to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory against Preston North End in the play-off final.

The ex-Tottenham forward agreed a new contract with the club and managed seven top-flight goals in 31 appearances as the east London club stayed up.

Sheringham also helped his side reach the FA Cup final against Liverpool in 2006, but his successful spot-kick in the penalty shootout was in vain as the Reds emerged victorious.

The former England star managed one more campaign in the Premier League with West Ham before dropping back into the Championship for a final season at Colchester United.

Danger man: Sheringham's goals helped West Ham win promotion back to the Premier League in 2005

Brad Friedel – Aston Villa to Tottenham Hotspur 2011, free transfer

Following a successful three years with Aston Villa, Friedel opted to move south and join Tottenham on a free transfer in June 2011.

The American stopper immediately became Spurs’ first choice keeper despite being 40, appearing in every Premier League game during his first season at the club.

Harry Redknapp’s side finished fourth in the league with Friedel in between the sticks and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup before being thrashed by Chelsea 5-1 at Wembley.

The former Blackburn keeper retained his place when Andre Villas-Boas took charge in the summer of 2012, but was gradually removed as the club’s No 1 after the arrival of France No 1 Hugo Lloris.

At the age of 43 Friedel made nine appearances last season and kept three clean sheets. His current contract at White Hart Lane is due to expire next month, although he has been offered a new deal.

Still going strong: Friedel has been offered a new deal with Tottenham at the age of 43

Christophe Dugarry – Bordeaux to Birmingham City 2003, loan

Signed on loan from French side Bordeaux in January 2003, Dugarry proved to be an inspired acquisition as he helped Birmingham avoid relegation from the Premier League.

The French World Cup winner, who was 31 when he moved to St Andrew’s, netted five goals in just four matches to save Blues from the drop.

With his individual style and willingness to run at opposition defenders, Dugarry endeared himself to supporters and earned his status as a cult hero.

He joined the club permanently in the summer of 2003 but couldn’t replicate his initial impact, scoring just once in 15 appearances before leaving by mutual consent and joining Qatar SC.

Dugarry hung up his boots in 2005 and has since been inducted into Birmingham’s Hall of Fame.
