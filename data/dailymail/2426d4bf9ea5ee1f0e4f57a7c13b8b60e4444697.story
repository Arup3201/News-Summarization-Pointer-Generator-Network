She was released from the Jefferson County Correctional Facility around 6:30 pm last night.

Although Hardy is not a teacher, according to state law no employee involved in education is allowed to have a sexual relationship with a student.

The charge is a second-degree felony which means if convicted, HardyÂ  could face up to 20 years in prison and will have to register as a sex offender.
