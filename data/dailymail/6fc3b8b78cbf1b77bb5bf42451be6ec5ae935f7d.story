West Ham midfielder Stewart Downing was feeling optimistic about the club's chances of finishing in the Barclays Premier League top 10 this season after the 2-0 victory over rock-bottom QPR.

The win, secured by a fifth-minute Nedum Onuoha own-goal and Diafra Sakho's header just before the hour mark, saw the Hammers rise to seventh place in the table.

Downing provided the corner from which the ball appeared to strike Enner Valencia's hand before bouncing in off Onuoha.

And Downing told Sky Sports 1: 'I thought it was Enner's goal to be honest. I just tried to put it into an area and we have good lads attacking it.

'We are due a little bit of luck and I think it has come off Onuoha in the end. Things have gone against us in the past but we got one today.

'If we consistently perform like we did against Liverpool (a 3-1 victory) and we did today, then we have a hell of a chance of being inside the top 10, if not further up.

'But we have to consistently do that. We let ourselves slip against Manchester United (last weekend's 2-1 defeat), but if we put a run together, we have got a good chance.

'The good thing is we have a good squad - we have injuries to come back. And I think this international break has probably come at a good time for us.'

Downing, holder of 34 senior England caps, has been out of the Three Lions picture for some time.

And asked about the prospect of earning a recall, the 30-year-old said: 'I've said in the past I'd love to play for England.

'But I've got to be honest and realistic - I don't think that will happen at the minute. If it does, that will be brilliant. I would love to play. But we'll see what happens.'
