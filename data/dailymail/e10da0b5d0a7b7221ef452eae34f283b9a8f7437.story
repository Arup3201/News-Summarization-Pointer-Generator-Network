A vast camp for migrants in Calais will open this morning, sparking fears it will attract hundreds more to the French town.

It will offer beds, showers, food and even power points to charge phones for the 2,500 migrants trying to reach Britain from the port. 

The Jules Ferry camp was built on a former children’s summer camp using a £3million EU grant which would include cash that ultimately comes from British taxpayers.

It sits right next to the Calais port, where hundreds of illegals try to board lorries each day in the hope of remaining undetected until reaching Britain.

Critics of the centre have compared it to the notorious Sangatte camp which became a magnet for thousands of migrants before it was closed down in 2002.

Michael Ellis, a Tory MP who sits on the Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘It is bonkers for the Calais authorities to do anything which encourages migrants to come to their city, it’ll only create problems for us next.’

Philip Davies, another Conservative MP, said: ‘This will do nothing to stem the tide of illegal immigrants coming into the UK.

‘It will clearly lead to even more risking their lives to get here and it is therefore outrageous that this is being partly funded by British taxpayers.

Meanwhile a third Tory, Philip Hollobone, described the plans as ‘madness’ and condemned the French authorities for providing the migrants ‘with a comfortable base from which to launch their clandestine attempts to break into Britain’.

Well appointed: The camp includes three football pitches and a tennis court over its 12-acre site

The new permanent day centre is spread over about 12 acres of parkland and comes with three football pitches and a tennis court.

Perhaps the only item the holiday camp will lack is a swimming pool.

From today, French-based charity La Vie Active will serve food to up to 500 migrants.

They will be capable of serving food to 1,500 migrants by mid-March and will also be able to sleep 500 women and children by then.

At the moment a second centre – Clement Ader – is currently providing refuge to 500 migrants on cold nights.

The migrants, many of whom have smartphones, will be able to charge their mobiles at power points, helping them to surf the internet on their devices.

The centre will have hot showers, toilet facilities and a nurse to treat injuries they sustain from attempting to jump on lorries.

It is also believed that there will be an office in the complex which will be manned by officers from the UK Border Force.

They will be there to inform the migrants of the realities of entering Britain, in an apparent effort to dissuade them.

The estimated 2,500 migrants in Calais are mainly from Eritrea, Sudan and Libya in Africa and the war-torn states of Syria and Afghanistan.

The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, announced the plans to build the migrant centre in Calais in October, saying it will cost around £4.3million to run each year.

Last month Philippe Mignonet, deputy mayor of Calais, claimed that the lure of the British benefits system is the reason for migrants flocking to Calais and not the new centre.

But Alp Mehmet, the vice-chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: ‘The sort of facility proposed by the French will undoubtedly lead to further illegal immigration.

‘The French authorities should be removing illegal migrants, not encouraging them and then asking the British tax payer to help foot the bill.’

Denis Robin, prefect of the Pas de Calais, insisted that the centre was an ‘important provision’ which would be run with ‘utmost professionalism’.

He said: ‘There was massive influx of migrants in the summer months from Africa, particularly Eritrea.

‘We were caught off guard and the sheer numbers led us to take emergency measures.

‘At present the situation has stabilised in terms of numbers, but come the warmer weather the numbers are again likely to increase.’
