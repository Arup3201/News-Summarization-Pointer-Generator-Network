Tom Ince has revealed just how close he came to joining Inter Milan before deciding to head to East Yorkshire and join Hull City.

The 22-year-old had been linked with a host of clubs including Stoke and QPR but decided to join the Tigers.

The frontman, opted to remain in England in search of a Premier League club following talks with Italian giants Inter Milan, and signed a two-year-deal with Steve Bruce's side.

On the move: Tom Ince joined Hull City on a two-year deal earlier this month

Ince, the son of former Inter and Manchester United midfielder Paul Ince, admits he turned down a better wage to join Hull, but claims he still harbors ambitions of playing in Italy.

'At my age, the most important thing to think about is my football development and I've come to Hull to be educated,' said Hull.

'Anyone can go to a status club and pick up five times more money but I am a football person. And that's why this move is right for me.

'It was very close. The San Siro was unbelievable. That's an ambition of mine but I don't think you should jump the gun.'

Father and son: Ince is still hopeful of following in his father Paul's footsteps by playing for Inter Milan
