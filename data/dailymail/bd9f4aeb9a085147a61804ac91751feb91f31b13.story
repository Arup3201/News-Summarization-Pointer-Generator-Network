The proportion of GCSE students scoring at least five Cs, including in English and maths, has fallen for the first time, official figures show.

The drop is said to be down to fewer English entries from private schools, but the harsh grading of this June's GCSE English exam is likely to have played a part.

The news comes as more than 45,000 pupils prepare to resit their English GCSE exams in November.

Tough exams: The number students achieving at least five A*-C GCSEs has dropped for the first time

The number of students in England who achieved five A*-C grades, including the two key subjects, is down almost half a per cent from 2011.

This year 58.6 per cent of pupils in England achieved five A*-C grades, according to Government data.

Thousands of pupils received lower than expected results in GCSE English in the summer after grade boundaries were raised between the January and June exams.

Not improving: The proportion of students achieving at least five C's is down by half a per cent since last year

A report compiled by the Association 
of School and College Leaders published last week blames the summer exam
for ‘enormous and unprecedented’ fluctuations in results.

The number of sixth-formers awarded with at least three top A-level grades has fallen for the first time in four years.

One in eight students at all English schools and colleges achieved at least three A*s or As in their exams, down from 13.1 per cent in 2011, according to Government statistics.

The Department for Education data also shows that private school students are three times more likely to score top grades than their state-educated peers.

The proportion of private school pupils achieving three or more A*-A grades dwarfed state schools with 30.6 per cent compared to 10.7 per cent and 7.9 per cent of those at further education colleges.

Overall, 91.7 per cent of all students achieved two or more A-levels at grade E or higher, down from 94.1 per cent in 2011.

And more boys than girls achieved three or more A-levels at grade A or higher (12.7 per cent compared with 12.2 per cent).

One in four secondaries saw at least a 10
per cent drop in the proportion of pupils securing a C and a fifth 
suffered at least a 15 per cent fall.

The report concludes sudden changes in
pass marks between January and June’s English GCSE sittings led to 
large swings in results.

In a
letter to the Commons education select committee, ASCL’s secretary 
Brian Lightman said pupils had suffered a ‘gross injustice’.

He renewed his demands for the English exams to be re-graded and for an independent inquiry.

A
document attached to the letter shows one in four out of 3,000 state 
secondary schools, some 750, saw large drops in their results.

However, the official Government figures show a rise in pupils entered for all the subjects in the Government’s English Baccalaureate, with 25 per cent and 18.1 per cent achieving the EBacc.

The EBacc qualifications is awarded to pupils who score a C grade or higher in English, maths, science, history or geography, and a language.

This year’s EBacc results are up on last year, when 23.8 per cent entered and 17.6 per cent achieved it.
