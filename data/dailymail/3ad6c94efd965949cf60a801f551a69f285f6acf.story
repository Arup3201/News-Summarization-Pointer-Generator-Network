Two men, aged 32 and 41, were arrested on suspicion of firearms offences. 

Officers said the three weapons found at the property were not capable of firing and were decommissioned.

In a statement, the Met Police said: 'Even if weapons are not capable of firing the presence of firearms in a public place causes panic and fear of violence.

'The collaborative effort between Bromley Borough officers, CCTV operators, and Specialist Firearms Command officers has lead to three firearms being seized and the arrest of two men.

'At around 4.30am on Sunday morning police were called to reports of a fight involving a group of what was believed to be around 10 men, in East Street, Bromley.

'As officers were attending CCTV operators observed that one man appeared carrying what looked like an assault rifle, and a sergeant attending the scene was alerted similarly by a member of the public.

'The weapons were an AK-47 style assault rifle, a WWII machine gun and a rocket launcher/rocket propelled grenade (RPG).
