An Australian woman has told in graphic detail of the moment she was allegedly sexually assaulted twice during a Malaysia Airlines flight by a chief steward whilst he was on duty.

Laura Bushney was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Paris on August 4 when her alleged attacker Mohammed Rosli Bin Ab Karim put his hands under a blanket and into her pants.

But this is a claim which the 54-year-old has denied as he told police that Ms Bushney did not resist him.

It was three hours into flight MH20 when the 26-year-old's nightmare began.

Ms Bushney wept as she recounted the terrifying moments to Channel Seven's Sunday Night program.

She claimed Rosli touched her upper thigh before putting his hands under her clothing, using the excuse that he was 'comforting her'. She insisted he touched her genitals and then digitally raped her.

'I just keep saying "Why didn't I scream, why didn't I shout?' she said.

'I am a strong person because I can do that, I know I can. But when I was in the moment, I couldn't. I felt so scared and petrified.'

At the time Ms Rosli, who was flying to Paris to join her boyfriend, was curled up at the back of the plane in row 81, with her head against the window and empty seats beside her. It was then that Rosli sat on the aisle seat and told her, in answer to her question, that it would be another nine hours before the plane touched down in Paris.

But something about his behaviour caused her concern.

The victim was seated at the back of the plane when the alleged sexual assaults occurred

'He grabbed my hand and told me to lie down and relax,' she said.

'I asked him to get me something to drink. I wanted to get him away from me. I didn’t feel comfortable.

'He came back and then he moved my legs and put them on his lap. I felt shocked, I didn't know what to do. I didn’t know what to say. And then he started rubbing my legs.'

After Rosli walked away, Ms Bushney managed to confide in one of the closest seated passengers - Canadian national Sophie Lachance - in row 88.

'I saw her face full of tears,' she told Sunday Night.

'She literally told me, "this man put his hands in my pants".'

It was Ms Lachance who urged the distraught Ms Bushney to report the incident to police.

Although Ms Bushney didn't say anything to Rosli, when asked if she made it clear to him that what he was doing was wrong she replied that he 'started moving his hands down, moving his hands down towards my belly button and I pushed his hands away and he started to massage my legs'.

'I thought by pushing it away that I was telling him that I didn't want it to happen,' she said.

As the assault was continuing, she managed to record the incident under a blanket, as well as filming video on her phone of an altercation she had with Rosli after the incident.

She says in the phone recording: 'He's massaging my legs, I'm so scared I just want to get off this plane.'

Rosli, she said, walked away but half an hour later he came back to the same seat and once again moved her outstretched legs onto his legs.

'I could feel that he has got an erection and he is rubbing himself up against me,' she said.

'He put his hands inside my pants…He put his fingers inside me.

'That's rape,’ the TV interviewer tells her. 'Yes,' she agreed through her tears.

Asked if she had tried to stop him, she replied: 'No.'

'As soon as it happened he got up and I think the thought process of what he had done…he realised what he had done…it had happened so fast that I was absolutely frozen,' she said.

The 54-year-old begged for Ms Bushney's forgiveness and asked her not to report the incidents

Rosli, a married man and a father of three, joined Malaysia Airlines in 1980.

After the assault, Ms Bushney made a handwritten complaint to other cabin crew members, detailing what had happened.

Ms Bushney was moved to a first class seat and at one point the captain came to speak to her. But neither he nor his team stopped the chief steward from approaching her yet again.

'I asked for him to be taken away, I didn’t want him anywhere near me,'  she said.

Yet her requested was not heeded.

A video recording, made on Ms Bushney's phone, showed Rosli sitting in a seat on the other side of the aisle, shaking his head, putting his hands to his face, or looking down at the floor as she accused him of putting his hand inside her pants.

Then she can be heard saying to the steward: 'I don't want to see you, go away you give me the creeps, you dirty old man.'

'How could you do it?' she is heard asking him through her cries of despair.

'I am so scared. I want to get off this plane.'

During this confrontation, Rosli can be seen begging for Ms Bushney's forgiveness asking her to give him 'a second chance'.

Rosli is then heard saying: 'I am so sorry. I am so sorry ma'am.'

The steward is currently detained by French police and is expected to face trial in France in six or seven months time

Malaysia Airlines has responded with a public statement but has not contacted Ms Bushney or offered an apology, any counseling or compensation

At Paris airport, Rosli was taken away for questioning and she was taken for a physical examination and a DNA swab.

However an airline official in Paris told her that if she filed a report that was not true she could get into serious trouble.

Despite the warning, Ms Bushney went ahead and informed French police.

After 14 hours of questioning, she was required to confront Rosli one last time.

When she accused him of raping her, Rosli told police that was not his intentions.

'He said that he never intended to do that and he said that I didn't resist him,' she said.

Malaysia Airlines has responded with a public statement that confirmed the allegations.

But they failed to offer an apology, any counseling or compensation to Ms Bushney.

'Malaysia Airlines can confirm that following allegations by a passenger travelling on flight MH20 from Kuala Lumpur to Paris on 4th August 2014 of inappropriate sexual behaviour by a member of the cabin crew, the member of staff in question has been detained for questioning by the French police.'

'Malaysia Airlines expects and accepts nothing short of the highest standards of conduct from its crew and takes any such allegations very seriously.'

Rosli is expected to face trial in France in six or seven months time and could be sentenced to 15 years in prison if convicted.

Whilst the investigation is ongoing, Ms Bushney is left traumatised while her attacker is detained by police.
