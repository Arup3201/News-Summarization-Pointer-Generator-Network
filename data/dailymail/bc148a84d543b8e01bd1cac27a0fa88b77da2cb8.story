A nightclubber was run over outside Buckingham Palace by an illegal taxi driver after she had already been hit by another motorist, an inquest heard today.

Student Stacey Cooke, 22, of Shoreham, Kent, had been out partying with friends at Mahiki in Mayfair, central London, and was ‘very drunk’ when she ran out onto The Mall and was hit by a car.

She had been having a ‘great time’ downing shots and drinking cocktails and wine with friends, but was hit by a chauffeur-driven Mercedes car at 2.20am, Westminster Coroner’s Court heard.

Death: Stacey Cooke, 22, of Shoreham, Kent, had been out partying with friends at Mahiki in Mayfair, central London, and was 'very drunk' when she ran out onto The Mall and was hit by a car

Within seconds she was hit again by a second Mercedes which ran over her body as she lay on the ground, and continued down the road - pulling over around 100ft further down.

In a court statement, the first driver Michael Florence, a chauffeur who works for diplomats and VIPs, said: ‘A pedestrian emerged from the curb and ran, and ran straight in front of my vehicle.

‘We are talking about an incident where a pedestrian has run headlong against the front of my car.’

He said he swerved his car full lock to the left to try to dodge her - but ‘still didn’t quite miss her, she was going that quickly’. He added: ‘I heard a clip, I heard a thud as my mirror clipped her arm.’

Mr Florence said within seconds of the incident last November he saw headlights in his rear view mirror and heard a second Mercedes car hit Miss Cooke with a ‘thud’.

He said: ‘I heard a bang. There was a lot of crunching and crushing of the body when the rear wheels went over the curb and the pedestrian. The driver made no attempt to stop and drove on.’

Tamir Uzan, the driver of the second car, is serving 20 weeks in prison for driving without due care, failing to stop, driving without insurance and taxi touting.

He told the inquest he saw what he thought was a bag lying in the road and a split second later went over something.

Uzan said: ‘Just before I went over, the 
split second before, I can remember seeing something that I thought was a
plastic bag in the road.

Probe: Miss Cooke was hit by a chauffeur-driven Mercedes car on The Mall near Buckingham Palace at 2.20am

‘I remember thinking it was nothing, it was pitch dark. I just went over thinking it was probably a bump.’

Asked why he didn’t notice it was a person lying in the ground, he said: ‘She was dressed all in black lying flat on the road with her face on the opposite side and it was very, very dark.

‘It is surprising Buckingham Palace had 
roads like that with ongoing traffic and bad lights. I think now the 
lighting has changed because of this accident.’

Michael Florence, first driver

He pulled over up the road and his two passengers rushed back and tried to give her CPR, but she died at the scene. The driver went back home where he was later arrested.

Samantha Molyneux, a friend of Miss Cooke, said in a statement: ‘Stacey was very drunk, she was silly, happy, bouncy, energetic and loud.

‘She was fine on her feet, not unsteady at all from what I remember. I can remember us singing and dancing, badly, but having fun. It seemed like she was having a great night, we all were.

‘That night we were mixing shots with cocktails. Stacey had also told me that she had not eaten and had been out with work for a drink before meeting us.’  

Miss Cooke - who was studying planning and property development Nottingham Trent University after leaving Walthamstow Hall School in Sevenoaks - had ‘very high’ levels of alcohol in her body.

Alcohol: The coroner raised concerns that Mahiki nightclub (file picture) in Central London served such strong cocktails and later let Miss Cooke stagger away without her bag

She had been working at chartered surveyors firm Mann Smith, based in Whitehall, at the time of her death.

Martyn Urquhart, the coroner’s officer at the court, told the inquest: ‘She was a very hard working pupil and was the first to win a scholarship to a local private school.

‘At school she grew into a confident and happy young lady. When she left school she spent three months volunteering in Fiji where she built a school. She had a lot of friends and a positive attitude.

'I remember thinking it was nothing, it was pitch dark. I just went over thinking it was probably a bump'

Tamir Uzan, second driver

‘Stacey had a wonderful perspective on life. It was expected Stacey would go far in life, she lived life to the full and grabbed every opportunity that came her way.  

‘She was an inspiration to her friends and family. She was a wonderful daughter and sister and she is dearly missed.’

The student loved swimming, tennis, and had been one of the best football players at her school.

She had been working in London on a year’s placement when she was hit by the cars last winter, and had been planning a trip to Columbia.

Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox said: ‘It is my understanding that the first vehicle was driven by Michael Florence.

‘The main impact between Stacey and the car was on the wing mirror and her body went down the side of the vehicle before she hit the floor. When she was on the floor the second vehicle went over her.’

Reasons: The coroner blamed the death on drinking too much alcohol and bad street lighting, and said she is considering writing a report to urge to change the lighting on the historic Mall

Miss Cooke had downed shots, drunk wine and cocktails and shared a ‘Treasure Trove’ cocktail, containing nearly two bottles of rum, at the club with two friends in the hours before her death.

Towards the end of the night she went outside into the smoking area to try to find her friend, but was not let back in by bouncers, and so left alone and without her handbag or purse and staggered off in the direction of The Mall.

'Had Stacey not been intoxicated with alcohol she wouldn't have been staggering around the Mall. It may be that this death would have been entirely avoided'

Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox

Today Dr Wilcox blamed her death on drinking too much alcohol and bad street lighting, and said she is considering writing a report to urge to change the lighting on The Mall.

She said: ‘Had Stacey not been intoxicated with alcohol she wouldn't have been staggering around the Mall. It may be that this death would have been entirely avoided.

‘The low lighting in this area contributed to this incident, I'm sure, as it prevented Mr Florence from seeing her in time to avoid the incident.

‘And the low lighting on the balance of probabilities stopped Mr Uzan from identifying what was in front of him.

‘The lighting was too poor for Mr Uzan at that point to have taken any reasonable action to have avoided Stacey's body.’

Concerns: In the 36 months until August 2012 there were 28 collisions around The Mall, leading to two deaths. In both of these cases poor lighting was one of the factors blamed

She added: ‘The lighting is poor, compounding that there is a considerable amount of street furniture, flag poles, trees and a lot of things that can obstruct the view.’

Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox also raised concerns that 
Mahiki nightclub in Central London served such strong cocktails and later let Miss Cooke 
stagger away without her bag.

She said ‘one would see it's pretty obvious problems would arise’ after selling cocktails with two bottles of rum in it.

She
added: ‘I can't speculate because I don't know why she wasn't let back 
into the club to collect her bag. I don't know if she asked.

‘It
is clear a minicab wasn't called for her despite her inebriated state 
which appears to be against the policy of Mahiki. But we have no idea 
what the conversation was.’

She said neither of the drivers would have a realistic opportunity of seeing Miss Cooke and avoiding her.

Delivering a verdict of accidental death, Dr Wilcox added: ‘I find it incredibly sad that a young woman of such enormous potential has lost her life from a culmination of too much alcohol and poor lighting.

‘I will consider this outside court but I'm almost certainly going to write a report in relation to whether the street furniture and lighting on the Mall should be reviewed.

‘There have now been two fatalities close by and poor lighting has been indicates as a factor in each.

‘I'm sure that Miss Cooke's family and all the officers and London Ambulance crews would like me to make a report in these circumstances.’

In the 36 months until August 2012 there were 28 collisions around The Mall, leading to two deaths. In both of these cases poor lighting was one of the factors blamed.
