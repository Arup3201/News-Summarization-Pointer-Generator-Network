Tokyo will host the 2020 Olympic games after winning a vote by the International Olympic Committee tonight.

Members of the city's delegation hugged and wept with joy as IOC President Jacques Rogge announced that the Japanese capital had beaten Istanbul to host the games.

It will be the second time that Tokyo has hosted the Olympics, after it held the Games in 1964.

The city overcame fears of the dangers of radiation from the Fukushima fallout and concerns over finances to win the right to host the 32nd Olympiad.

Delegations from all three cities had made final presentations to the committee earlier in the day before Tokyo won the final vote 60 to 36.

In their final presentations, Tokyo made its case as the 'safe pair of hands', Madrid as the least-expensive option, and Istanbul as an historic opportunity to bring the Olympics to a predominantly Muslim country for the first time.

Madrid, bidding for a third straight time, had seemed to have gained the most momentum in recent weeks despite Spain's economic crisis and 27 per cent unemployment rate.

The Tokyo bid had been the favourite, but Istanbul had rallied, surprisingly tying with Madrid in a first round vote.

Tokyo, bidding for the Games for a second time, will become the fifth city to host the Summer Olympics twice.

Relief: The people of Tokyo were delighted that their Prime Minister's attempts to allay fears over the prospect of nuclear radiation leaking from Fukushima were successful

A tiebreak in the first round of voting saw the Spanish city eliminated by just four votes to set up a final round between Tokyo and Istanbul.

The Madrid team claimed the Games would pose no financial risk because most of the venues were already built.

And when their bid was eliminated in the first round tie break there was an audible gasp from the audience, as the Spanish city had been expected to pose the biggest threat to the Japanese bid.

The prospect of Tokyo hosting the greatest show on earth had raised concerns in the final few days of the campaign about the leak of radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant just 150 miles away.

But the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe moved to allay those fears.

He told IOC delegates: 'Some may have concerns about Fukushima. Let me assure you the situation is under control. It has never done and will never do any damage to Tokyo.'

Norwegian IOC member Gerhard Heiberg asked for more assurances.

'It poses no problem whatsoever,' Abe said in Japanese, adding that the contamination was limited to a small area and had been 'completely blocked.'

'There are no health related problems until now, nor will there be in the future,' he said.

'I make the statement to you in the most emphatic and unequivocal way.'

Tokyo Electric Power Co, Fukushima's operator, has acknowledged that tons of radioactive water has been seeping into the Pacific from the plant for more than two years after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami led to meltdowns at three of its reactors.

Recent leaks from tanks storing radioactive water used to cool the reactors have added to fears that the amount of contaminated water is getting out of hand.

Tokyo continued to portray itself as the safe choice at a time of global political and economic uncertainty.

'Tokyo can be trusted to be the safe pair of hands and much more,' bid leader and IOC member Tsunekazu Takeda said.

'Our case today is simple. Vote for Tokyo and you vote for guaranteed delivery. Tokyo is the right partner at the right time.'

The Turkish delegation pressed its case of taking the games to a city linking the continents of Europe and Asia.

With
 the civil war in neighboring Syria posing a major issue for the 
Istanbul bid, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said taking 
the games to Turkey would 'send a very meaningful and strong message, 
not only to the world, but to our broader region.'

He said: 'At this critical moment, we would like to send a strong message of peace to the whole world from Istanbul.'

London Mayor Boris Johnson was among the first to offer his congratulations to the Japanese after the announcement was made.

Still with the glow of the success of hosting the London 2012 Games, Mr Johnson said that Tokyo had a lot of work to do but masses to look forward to.

He said: 'Huge congratulations to Tokyo for winning the honour of hosting the greatest sporting spectacular on the planet.

'I am sure that, like London, your great city will put on an extraordinary event. This is a magical moment of celebration to savour before the years of hard work ahead.

'Staging the Olympic and Paralympic Games is a tremendous privilege that unleashes golden opportunities for the host city.

'London has seen its transformative effect having embedded from the outset a long lasting legacy that reaches far beyond the weeks of sporting drama.

'We've been happy to welcome Rio to our city and we'll be delighted to share our experiences with Tokyo as they embark on their own journey to 2020.'

British Olympic Association spokesman Daryl Seibel said: 'We congratulate our friends in Tokyo and are confident that they will do a excellent job hosting the Olympic and Paralympic games in 2020.

'We also congratulate our colleagues and friends in Madrid and Istanbul on the quality of their bids.

'It is a reflection of the importance of hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games to have three world-class cities compete for this honour.'

Istanbul, for a long time the front-runner in this race, has suffered a series of blows in recent months - beginning with the political protests in Istanbul earlier this summer, some of them on proposed Olympic venues, followed by a doping scandal, the jailing of political opponents and journalists, and now the looming war in neighbouring Syria.

Istanbul had almost the perfect sales pitch until then, talking of the first Games in a predominantly Muslim country and a meeting of east and west.

Its bid team took a leaf out of London's book with 50 young ambassadors from sporting backgrounds as part of its final presentation.

Last time round: Tokyo last held the games in 1964. The stadium, completed in 1958, was  enlarged before the Olympics to hold 72,000 spectators

Both Tokyo and Madrid pledged to spend a fraction of the cost of the London 2012 Games.

Financial concerns have become the background to this race, especially with worries over the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and next year's winter games in Sochi being the most expensive ever.

Madrid 2020 boasted 80 per cent of its venues are already in place and a construction budget of just £1.3 billion - London's comparable cost was £9 billion.

The 2020 Games may be held thousands of miles away but it could create a boon for small British businesses.

On the back of their links with London's successful staging of the 2012 Games, many of them will be urged to try and sell their services and win contracts for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics.
