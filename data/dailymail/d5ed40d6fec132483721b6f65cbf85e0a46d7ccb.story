The four-inch valve which Herr Geier believes was part of the orange juice machine

Corporate fast food giant McDonald’s is being sued by a man who claims he was speared in the throat by a piece of machinery.

Klaus Geier, a German national, went to a San Fernando Valley McDonald's in April 2012, where he used the drive-through to order a chicken sandwich, chips and a large orange juice.

Herr Geier says that because there were no straws available he took the lid off the drink and began to drink according to the website tmz.com.

As he drank he claims that felt something catch in his throat – a four-inch valve which he believes was part of the orange juice machine.

Herr Geier says that he put his fingers in his mouth to retrieve the valve and ‘the serrated spear on the tip deployed and fired into his oesophagus’.

He pulled out the piece ripping his throat in the process. He now says he is left with two options: surgery which could cause him to lose his voice or live with an affected raspy voice.

Herr Geier’s lawyer Anthony Liberatore told MailOnline he was unable to comment.

MailOnline has contacted McDonald’s for a statement.

McDonald's are no strangers to being sued. In 1994, they were sued by 79-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled hot coffee in her lap while sitting in the passenger seat of her grandson's car. She sued the corporation claiming that the drink was too hot. The jury found that McDonald's was 80 per cent liable and Mrs Liebeck 20 per cent and awarded her more than $2million, The suit was finally settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.
