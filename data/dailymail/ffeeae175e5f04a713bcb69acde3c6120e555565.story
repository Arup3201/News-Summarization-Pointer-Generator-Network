A sickly stray cat that was taken in by a family in Canada is set to undergo gender reassignment surgery.

Mittens was adopted by Colleen Clarke-Murphy and her family,who live in Heart's Desire, Newfoundland, and when they took the cat to a veterinarian in October they for quite the surprise when they found out the cat was a hermaphrodite. 

And since Clarke-Murphy already had a male cat, and Mittens has both genitalia, she decided she wanted a female cat.

Mittens (above) will be the first cat to undergo gender reassignment surgery

The cat is a hermaphrodite with both genitalia, and while new owner Colleen Clarke-Murphy (above) was hoping for a girl, they advised it would be best for Mittens to become a boy

'Did I just hear you right?' asked Clarke-Murphy to the vet after she was told the news.

She got another surprise soon after, when she learned the female cat she wanted was not in the animal's best interest according to her vet, and they would make the cat male.

'They're the ones who know what they're doing' Clarke-Murphy told CBC News. 

'I mean, I really don't know. I'd like for it to be a female, but it really don't matter. It's got both parts.' 

'I think it's got both personalities, so it really don't matter.'

So then it was decided the cat would be spayed, neutered, and have reconstructive surgery.

The cost? $1500.

Money is not an object to Clarke-Murphy however when it comes to Mittens.

Mittens will now be spayed and neutered and then have reconstructive surgery

'She was part of my family when she came home with my daughter,' she said.

What's more, there are problems that come with the cat's current situation as it has bowel issues and problems urinating.

Now, a friend of Clarke-Murphy is auctioning off some items on Facebook to help pay the vet bill.
