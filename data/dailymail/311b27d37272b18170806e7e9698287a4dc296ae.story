Five people have been killed in a horror crash in southeast Washington leaving ten children without a mother, in an accident described as one of the worst in 40 years. 

According to eyewitness William Key, the wreck occurred when a speeding Mercedes blew through a red light before smashing into the back of an Acura making a right turn on a red light on Friday. 

'It was indescribable,' said the Oxon Hill, Maryland native. 'It was too hard. My wife heard it at home two blocks away.'  

Family has identified four of the fatally injured victims as (clockwise from top left) sister Tameika Curtis and Typhani Wilkerson, one-year-old Hassan Boykin, and Haddah Ba, age 13

Family identified sisters Tameika Curtis and Typhani Wilkerson as well cousins Haddah Ba, 13, and Hassan Boykin, 1, as four of the five killed in an interview with WUSA 9. 

Ms Curtis was the mother of eight children ranging from infancy to 15 years old. Wilkerson also had two small children. The survivor from the Acura, is the mother of the two dead children.  

A Go Fund Me page for the victim's surviving ten children has been established.

Police say it's still unclear why the Mercedes was being driven at such dangerous speeds.

The driver, who has not been identified, is in the hospital where he remains in critical condition, police told The Washington Post.  

Key says he saw the driver and the passenger escape the flaming wreck of the Mercedes with the driver having to pull himself from the fire by his elbows.

Both the Acura's driver and at least one passenger was thrown from the car into the street by the force of the impact.

A Go Fund Me page has already been established for the families of the two women, Tameika Curtis (left) and Typhani Wilkerson who had a combined 10 children

At least two passengers from the cars are being treated for injuries not believed to be life-threatening.  

'I’ve been in the county since the 1990s, and in terms of victims, it is one of the highest I’ve seen in a long while,' Assistant Fire Chief Paul Gomez told reporters.

The area if flanked by a large apartment complex and strip mall and is generally busy with pedestrians.

Key said he was so affected by the crash he returned to the scene with a bouquet of pink flowers, a book, and a doll to lay at the site.

'This is a bad intersection,' he said.
