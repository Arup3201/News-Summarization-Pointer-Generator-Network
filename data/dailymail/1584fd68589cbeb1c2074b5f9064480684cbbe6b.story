Obesity and diabetes could be prevented by switching off a receptor in the brain which causes overeating and food cravings.

Researchers have blocked the effects of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma in a small number of brain cells in mice, causing them to eat less and become resistant to a high fat diet.

It is hoped that the same results may one day be possible in humans to prevent weight gain.

Trendy diets are leaving millions of Britons with stomach aches and other digestive problems, according to new research.

Just under half of all adults suffer some pain when they try and lose weight and 55 per cent of people aged 25-34 – who are most likely to try ‘faddy’ diets - are in discomfort.

A report by Potter's Cleansing Herbs Tea said that the age group was most likely to try regimes such as Atkins and Cabbage Soup.

In a survey of 2,000 adults, it found that half are on a diet. Those suffering stomach ache are likely to give up their quest to lose weight and pile on the pounds.

Health expert Dr Chris Etheridge said: "It is so important to be aware our digestive health can affect our weight, with so many of us apparently unable to maintain our weight at a healthy level.’

‘Keeping our digestive health in tip-top condition is vital for weight management as well as our overall health.’

The study, by Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut, aimed to prevent obesity associated with a high-fat and high sugar diet.

The mice ‘ate fat and sugar, and did not gain weight, while their control littermates did,’ said Sabrina Diano, professor in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Reproductive Sciences at the university.

‘We showed that the PPARgamma receptor in
 neurons that produce POMC could control responses to a high-fat diet 
without resulting in obesity.'

POMC neurons are found in the hypothalamus and regulate food intake. They are the neurons that when activated make us feel full and curb appetite.

PPARgamma regulates the activation of these neurons.

Professor Diano and her team genetically engineered mice to delete the PPARgamma receptor from POMC neurons in order to see if they could stop obesity, despite the creatures eating a sugary and fatty diet.

‘When we blocked PPARgamma in these 
hypothalamic cells, we found an increased level of free radical 
formation in POMC neurons, and they were more active,’ she said.

While the findings could potentially 
solve the widespread obesity crisis, they could also have implications 
for people with diabetes.

PPAR gamma is a target of a class of drug
 called thiazolidinedione (TZD) – used to treat type 2 diabetes – which 
lowers glucose levels - but at the cost of some patients gaining weight.

The findings could have implications for people with diabetes.The scientists think that people treated with the thiazolidinedione drugs such as Pioglitazone (illustrated) gain weight as a side effect, but that future medication could solve this problem

‘Our study suggests that the increased weight gain in diabetic patients treated with TZD could be due to the effect of this drug in the brain,' 'Professor Diano said.

'Therefore, targeting peripheral PPARgamma to treat type 2 diabetes should be done by developing TZD compounds that can’t penetrate the brain.'

She believes it may also be possible to keep the benefits of TZD without the side-effects of weight gain.

‘Our next steps in this research are to test this theory in diabetes mouse models,’ she said.

The study was published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.
