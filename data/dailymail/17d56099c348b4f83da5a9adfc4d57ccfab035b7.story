Controversial boxer Adrien Broner has issued a grovelling apology to rapper Jay-Z and singer Rihanna after he launched a scathing attack on the pair last week.

Jay-Z, real name Shawn Corey Carter, and his management company Roc Nation Sports, offered Broner a contract worth $8million (£5.2m) a year for five years  but the fighter turned it down after being 'offended' by the deal.

In a stunning statement on Facebook, Broner claimed that Jay-Z could 's*** his d***', before continuing his attack during an interview with TMZ Sports. 

Adrien Broner has apologised after his astonishing rant at Jay-Z and Rihanna after a contract offer

Broner was offered £5.2m a year for five years from Jay-Z's company Roc Nation Sports, but refused it

When asked if he had considered accepting the offer to enable him to get 'one degree closer' to singer Rihanna - who is also signed to Jay-Z's label - Broner claimed: 'F*** Rihanna, she's only good for p***y.' 

But the boxer, who has a record of 29 wins to one loss, has since backtracked on his claims, apologising to both parties in a second interview with TMZ.

'I've gotta address something because I'm getting a lot of feedback from this interview I did with TMZ,' Broner said. 'I was going to let it ride out and say, "Forget the haters", but my big homie called me, somebody that I respect, and he made me understand why I was wrong.

'You never invite another man to another man's private parts. That's just ridiculous.

'I was caught up in the moment and I want to apologise to Jay for that. I'm a man at the end of the day. I'm wrong and I can admit when I'm wrong.

'I never should have said "Forget Rihanna." I said it in a more explicit way. I'm wrong, I'm sorry. If Jay wants to talk to me, you can get in touch with me and we can talk about it.'
