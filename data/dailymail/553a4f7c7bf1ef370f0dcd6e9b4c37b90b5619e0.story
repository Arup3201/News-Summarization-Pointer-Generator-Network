A debt-ridden nephew tried to murder his aunt in her hotel room and make it look like a suicide after stealing £10,000 from her.

After throttling 62-year-old Patricia McDonnell, James Duut, 32, left her body locked in the bathroom with 50 tablets scattered around her, the phone unplugged and the ‘Do not disturb’ sign on the door.

Convinced he had got away with the perfect crime, jobless Duut, from Erdington, Birmingham, emptied the remaining £3,400 out of her account.

Duut spent around £2,000 at Bicester Village in Oxfordshire and checked into an upmarket Birmingham hotel after leaving his aunt for dead

He then drove to an upmarket shopping centre with his gay partner, who was unaware of the plot, and embarked on a £2,500 spending spree on clothes.

Duut then checked into a separate four-star hotel, Birmingham’s landmark Radisson Blu, before going out and buying fellow drinkers cocktails at up to £144 a round. But unbeknown  to Duut, his victim regained  consciousness three hours after the attack.

Police arrested him after he returned to his hotel that night.

Duut initially denied attempted murder but changed his plea and was jailed indefinitely after appearing for sentence yesterday.

Judge Paul Farrer QC ordered him to serve at least eight years before becoming eligible for parole over what he described as a ‘premeditated and carefully planned attempt to murder’.

The court heard Duut, who was £60,000 in debt, had stolen a total of £10,050 from his aunt’s account just a month before the attack.

Miss McDonnell, a divorcee, was staying at the three-star Ramada hotel in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands – which was used for exterior shots of the motel in the former ITV soap opera Crossroads – for a short period after her nearby flat suffered fire damage.

She gave Duut her bank details when he offered to help her handle the insurance claim, and was unaware any money had gone.

Birmingham Crown Court heard that in the three days before the attack in December, Duut had used his mobile phone to search online for murders which had been made to look like suicides.

The court heard Duut arrived at his aunt’s hotel at 10.40am and went up to her room, where he gave her a cup of tea laced with sleeping aid Nytol.

He then got her to lie on the bed for a massage – something he used to do for her when he was younger – before throttling her from behind.

David Jackson, prosecuting, said: ‘She remembers shouting at him to “stop it, please stop it” and trying to kick out.’ He said she came around in the locked bathroom wearing just her underwear, with ‘several empty blister packets of prescription tablets strewn across the floor’.

Miss McDonnell raised the alarm with hotel staff after coming to in her bathroom at around 2.20pm

She was found only at 2.20pm when a hotel maid heard her cries for help.

‘She was in extreme pain and she was gagging and vomiting,’ said Mr Jackson. ‘She thought she had had a heart attack or a stroke.’ Miss McDonnell was treated in hospital for severe bruising around her face, neck and back. Tests also found traces of codeine and diazepam in her blood.

A medical expert said the injuries suggested throttling for between 15 to 20 seconds – with 30 seconds widely accepted as enough to kill someone.

Gary Bell QC, defending, said that Duut’s crime was ‘a bizarre episode  of madness’ by a man with ‘some psychopathic tendencies’.

Judge Farrer told Duut: ‘I have no doubt that you believed you had killed her. The victim here was somebody who trusted you. You are undoubtedly a highly manipulative individual prepared to resort to extreme violence to achieve your ends.’
