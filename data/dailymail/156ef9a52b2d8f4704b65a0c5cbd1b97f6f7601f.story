Found abandoned in a public park at just four weeks old - starving, shivering and suffering from a terrible skin condition - Bluebell didn't have the best start in life.

Today, however, the plucky little Jack Russell is putting her paws up as she settles down to life as the Duchess of Cornwall's newest pet.

Camilla decided to adopt the adorable puppy, now nine weeks old, from world-famous rescue centre Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London, who nursed Bluebell back to health.

It is the second time that Prince Charles's wife has stepped in to offer a home to an unwanted dog.

Last year the Mail revealed that she had taken on another Battersea rescue pup called Beth, also a Jack Russell.

The pairing was such a success that after the recent loss of her two eldest dogs, Tosca and Rosie, the Duchess couldn't resist when the charity contacted her about another waif.

A spokesman for the Duchess - who has owned several generations of Jack Russell puppies - explained that Bluebell, who was named by staff at the rescue centre, had a 'really awful' start in life.

'She was just four weeks old when she was found by a member of the public in quite a bad way,' they said.

'She had lost a lot of hair and her skin was pink and sore.

'The Duchess was delighted to take her on.' A source close to Camilla, who picked up her new dog last week, added: 'Beth is a delightful dog and has been wonderful with the Duchess's five young grand-children - Bluebell is a very welcome addition to the family.' Like Beth, Bluebell will have the run of several palatial residences including Ray Mill, the Duchess's Wiltshire home, Prince Charles's country residence Highgrove as well as Clarence House and Birkhall, his Scottish estate.

Camilla was treated like any other potential owners, however, and had to pay a £105 rehoming fee which covers the charity's costs as well as microchipping, initital vaccinations, flea and worming treatments and a new collar, identification tag and lead.

Battersea does not receive any government funding and is totally reliant on publication bequests and donations.

Claire Horton, chief executive of the home, said: 'Once again the Duchess of Cornwall ahs given a second chance in life to a Battersea dog in need. Bluebell arrived at Battersea having had such an awful start in life, so we couldn't be happier that she caught the eye of the Duchess and now has such a wonderful home.

'Bluebell will be an excellent companion for Beth and we're confident she will bring a lot of pleasure to her new family.'
