Mark Zuckerberg has long been the target of Internet trolls, and on Thursday the billionaire Facebook founder finally had the chance to shut one down.

Zuckerberg took to Facebook Thursday morning to announce that his company would be helping in the global fight against Ebola by providing internet connectivity in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, in order to help medical and aid workers, and also posting information from UNICEF.

He then urged everyone to donate money if they could, saying Facebook had created a program that would allow individuals to do so directly, at which point a user from Spain by the name of Pepe Pepe Pepe decided to attack Zuckerberg - but without doing his research first.

Shut it down: mark Zuckerberg (above) was trolled by a man who called Facebook's new initiative to fight the spread of Ebola a 'marketing ploy'

Burnt: Soon after the man made his snide comment, Zuckerberg responded that he had personally donated $25million to the fight (above)

The young man commented under Zuckerberg's video,  'Facebook is giving everyone the ability to donate, but how much is Facebook donating ? ... this seems just marketing to me one more time.'

Lucky for Pepe Pepe Pepe, he got a response, just not the one he was probably hoping for.

Zuckerberg responded, 'I personally donated $25 million and Facebook is spending millions more on providing Internet connectivity in the affected regions.'

And that is how one shuts down an Internet troll.

Public knowledge: Zuckerberg had publicly announced he and his wife Priscilla (above) were donating the money back on October 14

The truth is, Zuckerberg's very generous donation was made public weeks ago, as he announced he and his wife Priscilla would be giving this large amount with a Facebook post on October 14.

But hey, maybe Pepe Pepe Pepe only recently became friends with Mark.
