Not again: Sharon Stone is being sued by a her former housekeeper for wrongful termination less than a year after her head nanny filed a lawsuit against the star

It looks like Sharon Stone will be heading to court again.

The 54-year-old is being sued by a former housekeeper less than a year after her children's nanny filed a racism complaint against the actress.

Stone's maid Angelica Castillo is seeking unspecified damages from the Basic Instinct star for wrongful termination and wrongful retaliation, reports RadarOnline.

In the lawsuit, Castillo says she was
hurt while working for Stone, but despite her doctor's orders, the 
Casino actress refused to ease her employee's workload.

The housekeeper - who started working
for Stone in 2010 - injured her back while loading heavy bags of groceries
into her car while on a grocery run for Stone.

Castillo
was ordered by her doctor to 'undertake a brief period of bed rest,' 
says RadarOnline.

But Stone is said to have denied her employee's request for rest, insisting that she come to work the next day and perform 
her regular duties, including 'lifting and moving heavy items as part of
cleaning the residence.'

Four
months later, after the maid told Stone that she was still in pain, the
actress is said to have yelled at her for working slowly, calling her 
'crazy' and stupid.'

The blonde star then fired Castillo in October 2012 after just two years working for her. 

However on Tuesday Sharon's lawyer Marty Singer told TMZ: '[This lawsuit] is bizarre and ridiculous.  Ms. Castillo was never fired, and as of today is still covered by health insurance as an employee of Ms. Stone. We are confident that Ms. Stone will prevail in this meritless case.'

Derogatory remarks: The maid Angelica Castillo accuses the star of forcing her to lift heavy items despite her injured back

Castillo is the second employee to file a suit against the star in less than a year.

In
May 2012, the actress was taken to court by her children's Filipino 
nanny who accused her of making derogatory comments about her ethnicity.

Erlinda Elemen alleged Stone made disparaging comments about her accent and told the nanny not to talk to her children because she didn't want them to 'talk like' her.

After a series of other incidents, including a reduction in Elemen's pay, Stone fired the nanny for no reason in 2011.

In February of that year, Elemen filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, alleging among other things, harassment, failure to prevent harassment and retaliation.
