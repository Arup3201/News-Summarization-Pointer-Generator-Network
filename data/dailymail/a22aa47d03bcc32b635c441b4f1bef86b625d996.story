Angel di Maria is set to miss Manchester United's trip to Southampton on Monday as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury. 

The Manchester United star limped off at Old Trafford just 14 minutes into the 3-0 victory over Hull on Saturday.  

The £59.7m record signing was replaced by Spanish midfielder Ander Herrera.

The former Real Madrid forward sat out United's 2-1 victory over Stoke City on Tuesday night after suffering an injury against Hull. 

Louis van Gaal confirmed the Argentine would miss the trip to face the Saints, but had some good news on the progress of Dutch star Daley Blind who suffered a knee injury on international duty with Holland in November. 

'Di Maria is not so heavy but of course he shall not play against Southampton but you never know,' said Van Gaal.

'In December we will see light at the end of the tunnel,' he added in relation to Blind.
