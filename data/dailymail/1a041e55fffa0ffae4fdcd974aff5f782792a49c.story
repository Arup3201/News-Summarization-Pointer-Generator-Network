There's no denying the HTC One was among the leading handsets of 2013 sweeping the board of awards - so there was always going to be a lot of pressure on its successor.

The Taiwanese firm has now officially unveiled this follow-up device - called the HTC One (M8) - but does it live it up to its predecessor?

The screen on the flagship handset has been made slightly larger at 5-inches, up from 4.7-inches, and HTC has added an extra camera sensor to the rear of the device to capture more depth information.

HTC's One (M8) handset, pictured, was officially unveiled at an event in London. It has a 5-inch, full HD screen, duo camera with 4.1 Ultrapixel on the rear, and a 5MP camera on the front

The handset has a 5-inch, full 1080p HD screen, a 
quad-core 2.3Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and up to 32GB of built-in storage.

It additionally has a MicroSD slot meaning the phone's storage can be increased up to 128GB.

The handset has a duo-camera on the rear of the device with a depth sensor, as well as a 4.1 Ultrapixel sensor.

While the camera on the front of the handset is 5MP.

The HTC One (M8) runs on HTC Sense 6.0, on top of Android 4.4 KitKat.

HTC has also added amplifiers to the dual frontal stereo speakers that automatically pick out specific 
sections of music - such as the vocals, or the bass - and adjusts them 
individually to improve the playback and prevent distortion.

To turn the screen on, users can now tap the screen, as well as press the power button on the top of the device.

Elsewhere, its Li-Po 2600mAh battery is said to have a 20-hour battery life.

This duo-camera set up has been designed to help people not only take better, clearer photos, it means these photos can be refocused using the device's new advanced photo tools.

Elsewhere, the unique dual frontal stereo speakers now feature built-in amplifiers that  automatically pick out specific sections of music - such as the vocals, or the bass - and adjusts them individually to improve the playback and prevent distortion.

The phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 2.3GHz quad-core processor, has 2GB of RAM and a Li-Po 2600mAh battery which HTC claims will last for 20 hours.

Prices for SIM-free versions of the handset haven't officially been announced by HTC, but Carphone Warehouse in the UK is offering it for £42 per month SIM-free for £549.95. 

The HTC One (M8) is being rolled out globally, staring in the UK and online in the U.S. today. 

It will then be available in U.S. stores from 10 April.

The exact release schedule for other countries has not been announced yet.

The phone comes in three colours - Gunmetal Grey, Glacial Silver and Rose Gold.

In the UK, the phone is available on Three for an upfront cost of £49 and a choice of four 24-month price plans.

These start at £38 a month for 600 minutes and 2GB of data, up to £44 a month.

Google is said to have approached HTC when it originally began building its Nexus range back in 2012, but the Taiwanese firm was too busy with its smartphones, such as the HTC One (M8) pictured, so Google is believed to have teamed up with Asus instead

HTC is also launching a range of cases for the One (M8) that react to touch gestures. These cases, pictured, will be available in seven colours including blue, left, black, right, and green. They have a dotted appearance on the front that shows basic details, including the time and weather, without the case being opened

The handset will also be available 
from EE in Gunmetal Gray and Glacial Silver online on the 26 March, and 
through EE stores on the 27 March.

Customers
 who buy the HTC One (M8) on a £37.99 per month EE Extra plan, with an 
upfront cost of £29.99 - before 10 April will get twice the amount of 
data of EE’s standard 4G plans - taking their monthly limit up to 4GB - 
for the duration of their contract.

This also includes unlimited minutes and texts to use in the UK and Europe.

'The HTC One was a standout device, in terms of both hardware and software, and deserved many of the accolades it was awarded from customers and critics.

'As much as this was a boost for HTC, it meant that any successors would have to live up to the hype and be significantly better.

'HTC is selling the HTC One (M8) as the 'best just got better', and while that's true for some of its features, other improvements feel marginal.

'The duo camera is a nice feature, but didn't wow us. It was difficult to test the new sound options in the speakers during our brief hands-on, and we couldn't test battery life.

'The screen has been made larger, and this makes it slightly more difficult to use than its predecessor, but this is a minor flaw.

'HTC has moved the touch buttons from the front of the handset and they are now software-based, again a minor flaw but will slow existing HTC One users down.

'The Taiwanese firm has also removed the plastic strip seen in the casing of the One, and the One (M8) is now made entirely of lightweight metal, This makes it feel more expensive than its predecessor, and noticeably so next to the likes of Samsung's plastic Galaxy S5.

'The most impressive improvements are software-based. The advanced photo editing tools, including the new refocus options made possible with the addition of the rear-facing depth sensor, are great. They certainly give Nokia's 1020 a run for its money.

'The new touch gestures are a simple addition, but make a huge difference to how we used and interacted with the device. And the fact these gestures work with the new cases is even more impressive.

'However, there isn't anything in this handset that makes it leap out as a must-have device. 

It may be that we've been spoilt by the fingerprint scanners and tracking features of Apple and Samsung devices, or it may be that HTC just wants to keep things simple - either way, the device feels too similar to the current HTC One to justify paying an extra £549 for.'

Customers
 on this plan also get 2 for 1 cinema tickets with EE Film, and anyone 
who buys the handset before 10 April will also be offered a free return 
flight to select European destinations.

It
 will also be available in select Vodafone stores for free, from £42 on 
Red 4G plans. These plans comes with unlimited calls and texts. The 
first 3000 customers to buy with Vodafone will also get a HTC Boombass.

Feature
 wise, HTC has added advanced photo editing tools to the device that 
lets people easily refocus, and cut out and paste parts of images into 
other photos, for example.

Later
 in the year these features will also be made available on older models 
of HTC phones via an Android app called Zoe, which will also let groups 
of users create and contribute to photo albums.

The firm has additionally taken its lead from the likes of LG by adding touch gestures to its homescreen.

For
 example, users can tap the screen to switch it on, and see 
notifications or the time, without having to press the power button. 
Swiping from the left of a locked screen now opens HTC's Blinkfeed.

These gestures are recognised even if the phone is locked.

HTC is also launching a range of cases for the One M8 that similarly react to these touch gestures. 

These cases, available in seven colours including red, pink, orange and green, have a dotted appearance on the front.

When
 a user taps the front of the closed case, basic details such as the 
time, weather and notifications are shown on the front without having to
 open the case to view the screen..
