DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg couldn’t let go
of ‘Breaking Bad’.  Variety reports that
he was willing to pay $75 million to fund three more online episodes of the hit
AMC drama.

Katzenberg announced to TV executives at the Mipcom Mart in
Cannes six weeks ago that he wanted to create a new way of watching quality
short form entertainment.

He offered to pay $25 million per episode for three
episodes of ‘Breaking Bad’ starting from where the show last ended.

‘I’m going to create the greatest pay-per-view television
event for scripted programming anybody’s ever done,’ said Katzenberg.

Unfortunately for fans, Katzenberg made his big offer a
little too late. Creator Vince Gilligan’s storyline was already set in stone.

Each webisode would have aired in 6 minute instalments over
the course of one month. Each instalment would only cost viewers 50 to 99
cents.

‘The last series cost about $3.5 million an episode,’ said
Katzenberg. ‘So they would make more profit from these three shows than they
made from five years of the entire series.’

Even though Katzenberg can’t get his hands on more ‘Breaking
Bad,’ his novel idea may change the way viewers watch quality television.

‘I share the story with you only to tell you that I have the
courage of my convictions in this. I just think that there is a whole new
platform for (short form) entertainment … and the higher the quality of the
stuff that fills it, the higher people will be paid for the work that they are
doing there,’ he said.

Online television is high on Katzenberg's radar. At the end of April, DreamWorks Animation bought YouTube entertainment network AwesomenessTV for $33 million.

The captivating AMC hit 'Breaking Bad' is officially over and won't be airing online as Katzenberg planned
