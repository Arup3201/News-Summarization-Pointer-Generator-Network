Coronation Street actress Barbara Knox has been banned from the roads for a year after admitting drink-driving.

The 81-year-old, who plays Rita Tanner in the ITV soap, entered a guilty plea at Crewe Magistrates' Court today.

Knox was sitting in the passenger seat when her daughter, Maxine Ashcroft, 56, was stopped by police in Knutsford, Cheshire, on March 10 last year.

Police arrested Ashcroft, and when Knox drove to the police station to collect her, she was arrested for the same offence.

A sample of blood was taken which gave an alcohol reading of 85 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood - the legal limit is 80. 

The actress, represented by solicitor Nick 'Mr Loophole' Freeman, had previously denied the offence last April and was due to go on trial next month.

It was said on her behalf today that she 'bitterly regrets' the incident.

Knox, of Mere, Cheshire, was a passenger in Jaguar driven by daughter Maxine Ashcroft, 56, last year as pair were heading home from family gathering in Alderly Edge, Greater Manchester.

Police were called by a concerned fellow driver, and Ashcroft was arrested for drink driving.

Ashcroft was found to be nearly three times the legal limit when she gave a breathalyser reading at Middlewich police station. 

Knox was given a lift home buy officers who noticed that she had also been drinking, but later came to collect her daughter from the station.

When she arrived, police gave her 'stern advice' not to climb back into her car, but she was seen moments later reversing out of a parking space in a nearby supermarket.

Knox, who plays Rita Tanner on the soap, has been banned from driving for a year and fined at total of £4,750 after admitting drink driving on March 10 last year

She only made it a short distance before police stopped her and also arrested her for drink driving.

At a previous hearing last year, it was said by Mr Freeman that Knox claimed she was “physically manhandled” by officers before she was charged.

She was said to be in “a highly emotionally charged state” when she was taken into custody. 

Last year, as Knox continued to maintain her innocence, District Judge Bridget Knight told the court: 'This is actually a very simple case being made very complicated and expensive.'

In relation to the 'manhandling' claim, she added: 'It’s all by the by ... I’m not here for tittle tattle, it may be of interest to some but it’s not relevant to the case.'

Today, after Knox relented, her lawyer  said the actress was 'the author of her own misfortune'.

As well as being banned from driving for a year, Knox was ordered to pay a £3,000 fine, and £1,750 in court costs. 

Ashcroft, from Lechlade, Gloucestershire, also pleaded guilty to drink driving and was banned from driving for two years. 

A spokesman for the soap said it was 'a private and personal matter'.

The news comes just four days after fellow Coronation Street actress Anne Kirkbridge passed away after battling breast cancer.

Knox was pictured with fellow stars William Roache and Anthony Cotton sitting in the front row of the National Television Awards two days ago.

Mr Roache paid an emotional tribute to his 'soulmate' Anne at the awards, moving his fellow stars, including Knox, to tears.
