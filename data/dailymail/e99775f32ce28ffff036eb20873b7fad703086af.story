Red Sox legend David Ortiz used a tiny chihuahua as his backstop when he went on camera recently to say he wants his contract extended.

The 38-year-old, who led the Red Sox to victory in the World Series, was seen stroking the dog as he talked about what it would take to keep him on Boston's beloved team.

Dressed in a shirt that coordinated with the dog's outfit, Big Papi said on Sunday that he wanted to finish his career with the team but his future there depended on contract offers.

As he stroked the shelter dog, named Nacho, Ortiz told Sports Final on Sunday night: 'It’s been a hell of a ride as long as 
I’ve been here. But as I always keep on telling 
people, this is a business.'

Ortiz has a year remaining on his current $26 million two-year deal and, despite being close to an age when many major league players would retire, he appears to still be on top form.

Riding a wave of popularity after the Sox took the World Series, Ortiz hinted that he wanted an extension when his contract runs out in November. 

'Hopefully, I won’t have to go and wear another uniform,' he said, adding: 'As long as they keep offering me a job 
and I keep doing what I’m supposed to do and the relationship keeps on 
building up, I’m going to be there.'

But the hitter, who had 30 home runs last season, added he would only stick around for the right deal.

'If I have to, I’ve got no choice. I’m not going to quit. As long as I keep hitting the ball the way
 I have, I’ve got to keep on giving it a try,' he told the sports program.

As well as talking baseball, Ortiz was 
pushing a campaign to help shelter dogs, like Nacho the chihuahua who 
remained on his lap throughout the interview.

The
 star has teamed up actor Josh Duhamel for Pedigree's See What Good Food
 Can Do campaign, which was launched at the Sundance Film Festival this 
week.
