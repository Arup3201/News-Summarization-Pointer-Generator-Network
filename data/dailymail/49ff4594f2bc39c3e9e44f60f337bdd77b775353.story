Tragic: Bradley Eames, 20, became the third victim of the dangerous drinking game after he downed two pints of gin

Schools are tackling the dangerous internet drinking craze of NekNominate by reading out warnings in assemblies and putting up signs on noticeboards.

The Local Government Association (LGA) is also urging Twitter and Facebook to introduce warnings over the drinking game, which has been linked to several deaths, councils have said.

The organisation, which represents almost 400 councils in England and Wales, said prominent messages were needed to address the dangers of the craze.

NekNominate involves people filming themselves downing alcohol, nominating someone to continue the game, and posting the video on social media sites.

Councils are now publishing warnings about alcohol through internet safety campaigns that provide links for parents, carers and young people.

On Wednesday, the industry-funded charity Drinkaware called on parents to take a tough stance against the game over fears that young teenagers are under pressure to take part.

Katie Hall, chair of the LGA’s community wellbeing board, said: 'This is an utterly reckless and totally irresponsible craze which has tragically claimed lives. More should be done to highlight the dangers and persuade people not to participate.

'We believe social media operators have a responsibility to provide health warnings to user groups and individuals.

'The LGA is looking for these corporations to show leadership -and not ignore what is happening on their sites.

'We are urging Facebook and Twitter executives to sit down with us and discuss a way forward which tackles this issue head-on.'

The LGA said Boston Borough Council in Lincolnshire is encouraging those people nominated to continue the drinking game to contact their community safety team.

Sevenoaks District Council in Kent is launching an internet safety campaign on NekNominate, while Worcestershire County Council has called for people not to join in.

Norman Wells from the Family Education Trust said: 'It is tragic to see young people being deceived into thinking that consuming an excessive amount of alcohol in a short period of time is harmless fun.

'Parents and teachers desperately need to communicate the message that heavy drinking is not a game.

'Any sense of excitement that alcohol brings will only ever be short-lived, but the pain and distress caused by excessive drinking can last a lifetime. In fact, in some cases, it can even kill.

'Over recent years, growing numbers of British teenagers have chosen not to drink at all, but overall young people in the UK still drink higher levels of alcohol than many other European countries and are oblivious to the serious problems it can cause.'

Ross Samson, 26, is thought to have inadvertently spread the game where players film themselves downing drinks and posting the videos online, daring others to outdo them

A Facebook spokesman said: 'We do not tolerate content which is directly harmful, for example bullying, but behaviour which some people may find offensive or controversial is not always necessarily against our rules.

'We encourage people to report things to us which they feel breaks our rules so we can review and take action on a case by case basis.'

NAHT Policy Advisor Siôn Humphreys said: 'This craze and its tragic consequences need to be highlighted.However, a knee jerk reaction could prove counter productive.

'Highlighting the danger of 'nec nominations', which can include under-age drinking and substance abuse, would need to be delivered from an authoritative view point in an age appropriate manner to individual year group assemblies. Whole school assemblies are not a solution because of the wide age range involved.

'There may be circumstances in which a school becomes aware that pupils are involved in such activities and the first course of action would,as a matter of urgency be to discuss the matter with parents. Some situations could invoke a safeguarding response.

'Schools would also need to respond appropriately and proportionately if the consequences of involvement in "nec nomination" spill over into school.'
