Atletico Madrid chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin has called fans responsible for the violent clashes which resulted in the death of a Deportivo La Coruna supporter 'criminals and murderers'.

Francisco Javier Romero Taboada - a 43-year-old married man  - was pulled from the Manzanares river near Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium with a severe head injury, advanced hypothermia and in cardiac arrest.

He was taken to San Carlos Clinic in Madrid by ambulance but died shortly after.

Spanish newspapers Marca and AS led their front pages on Monday with the tragic news 

The violence started at 9am local time on Sunday before Atletico's 2-0 La Liga victory over Deportivo and lasted for an hour, with 200 people involved, according to Spanish newspaper Marca, who say 11 others - including a police officer - were injured and 21 arrests were made. 

AS, another Spanish newspaper, claim ultras from both clubs agreed to meet near the Vicente Calderon and that 24 arrests were made. 

Gil Marin condemned those involved and pleaded with fans to come forward with information that may lead to more arrests. 

He said: 'In a group of 4,000 people there will always (be) a motherf*****. These kind of criminals and murderers are hidden in the mass of people. They seize every opportunity to appear. What they have in their head is garbage.

'Atletico Madrid have banned 13 people for life for other, much-less-serious incidents. Those involved shouldn't be at Vicente Calderon ever again, they should be in jail.

'The most important (thing) is to determinate who is behind all this. I have friends with their sons who live in the area (where Atletico ultras Frente Atletico are located) and they are healthy people.

'The criminal have to go to prison and we are asking that anyone who knows anything to notify us. This incident hurts all of the work we done during recent years.'

Deportivo coach Victor Fernandez said after the match: 'It's one of the saddest days in Spanish football in recent years. They are reprehensible and despicable acts.' 

President Tino Fernandez added: 'It's tragic and horrendous news. Our thoughts are with the family of the deceased. We are at his family and friends' complete disposal to help them in any way we can.'

Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo also led with story (black banner) on their front page on Monday 

Marca used their front page on Monday to demand that action be taken to tackle violence in football, saying 'Enough excuses: we must rid football of violent people.' 

Spain's government anti-violence commission is due to meet on Monday to discuss Sunday's events. 

Spanish league authorities (the LFP) condemned the trouble and said on Sunday they had wanted the match postponed, but this was not possible.

The LFP and Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) offered their condolences to the family of Romero Taboada. 

RFEF general secretary Jorge Perez explained that, after only receiving information about the seriousness of the incidents just before kick-of, it was considered 'counter-productive' to postpone the match due to security reasons.

He said in Marca: 'Eleven minutes before the start of Atletico Madrid-Deportivo, Victoriano Sanchez Arminio (president of the referee's committee) received a call from the LFP and another from the match referee.

'He spoke with a member of the RFEF and, with the stadium full and little time left, for reasons of security and public order it was decided that it could be counter-productive to suspend it.'
