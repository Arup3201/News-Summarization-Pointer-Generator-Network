Munster dramatically claimed yet another ‘miracle’ European victory as Ian Keatley’s late drop goal sunk gallant Sale, who were on course for a famous win inspired by Danny Cipriani.

This was a tale of two halves and two fly-halves. The home side led this Champions Cup, Pool One tie at the AJ Bell Stadium 23-7 at half-time after a masterclass of attacking artistry from Cipriani, who played like a man deserving of an England squad place.

Yet, Sale had to play into a strong wind after the break and instead of their No 10 having the last word, it went to his opposite number: Keatley.

In the Munster tradition established by Ronan O’Gara, Keatley’s sensational swerving shot in stoppage-time settled a mesmerising encounter, which suggests Europe’s new era will contain all the thrills and spills of the old.

The clock had reached 80 minutes when the Irish side — urged on by their ‘Red Army’ in the stands — were in the midst of one last assault. Their pack drove deep into Sale territory and worked a position for the drop goal.

Yet, to Keatley’s credit, he aborted the attempt under pressure from the Sharks defence. But Munster kept the move alive and seconds later, their stand-off launched a kick into the wind and it arced round like a putt on a sloping green to fly through the posts. Amid the Irish euphoria, Sale’s shattered players lay in a series of dejected heaps. This was a cruel fate after so much heroic effort.

After getting his breath back, Keatley said: ‘It was pretty nervy. For the first attempt, Chris Cusiter chased me down so I had to pass it on. But the lads got me in a great position again and thankfully it went over. As the 10, it is your responsibility and you have to take that on your shoulders. Thankfully I did all the practice and it paid off.’

In the opening period, despite Dave Kilcoyne’s early try, Munster were under the cosh as Sale ran amok on the back of Cipriani’s astute prompting. His distribution and running were sublime, but he also defended resolutely and was immaculate with his goal-kicking — scoring 16 points and not missing any of his six shots.

He endured one or two decision- making wobbles in the second half when his team were struggling, but overall this was a compelling Test audition. All the indications last week were that Cipriani is destined to miss out on a place in the England squad to be announced on Wednesday, but this performance may force a late re-think by Stuart Lancaster and his assistants.

‘Cipriani was outstanding for us,’ said Sale’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond. ‘Any contentious opinions about his goal-kicking were put to rest today and he put his tackles in too — 12 or 13 of them.

‘He is playing really well and if the England coaches select him, he won’t let them down.’

Magnus Lund touched down from close-range for the hosts in the 24th minute and five minutes later, Sale surged clear when Johnny Leota seized on Tom Brady’s deft pass and swept over in the left corner.

Diamond’s men were denied a possible penalty try when Tommy O’Donnell was sin-binned for an off-the-ball tackle and after half-time, Leota ignored an overlap but was unable to score his second try.

Ultimately, that was decisive as Munster reverted to a power game and tries by Andrew Conway and Conor Murray set up a grandstand finish. Another Cipriani penalty was soon cancelled out by Keatley, who then delivered the winning shot shortly after.

‘That was a brutal way to go down,’ said Sale captain Dave Seymour. It most certainly was. Now the Cheshire club must brace themselves for the daunting prospect of a trip to Clermont Auvergne, while Munster will await Saracens on Friday night, buoyed by their latest escape act.
