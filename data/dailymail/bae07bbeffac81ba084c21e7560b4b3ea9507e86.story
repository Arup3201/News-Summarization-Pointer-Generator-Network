Lionel Messi was spotted enjoying an extended summer break while his Barcelona team-mates train at St George's Park.

Argentina's captain was with his friends and family, including girlfriend Antonella Roccuzzo, in Ponza, a small island off the coast of Italy.

The 26-year-old was given extra time off after a grueling season that took him all the way to the World Cup final.
