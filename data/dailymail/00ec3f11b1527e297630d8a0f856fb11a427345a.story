Starbucks has reported its first-ever UK profit, putting an end to years of losses that saw it avoid paying taxes in Britain.

The coffee chain was branded ‘immoral’ by MPs for using a host of schemes that effectively funnelled money out of the UK and overseas.

The practice allowed it to notch up losses, avoiding the need to pay corporation tax, despite reporting years of bumper sales.

Profit: Starbucks made its first-ever UK profit of £1.1m after sales for the previous year were more than £300m

But the US giant yesterday reported a modest pre-tax profit of £1.1million in its British operations – a paltry amount given that sales for the previous year were in excess of £300million. 

The firm refused to issue details of its revenues in a highly unusual move.

The small profit resulted in a meagre tax payment of just £232,363, a sum that is likely to be dwarfed by its multi-million pound revenues when it issues full accounts later this week.

It paid an additional £11.2million in corporation tax, which it said was the final instalment of the £20million it offered to pay three years ago when faced with a consumer backlash.

Starbucks faced protests and boycotts following revelations that it had scrimped on tax payments in the UK for years.

It emerged the group had paid just £8.6million in corporation tax since coming to Britain in 1998, despite racking up combined sales of more than £3billion.

UK boss, Mark Fox, said company's performance is a result of 'engaging with its employees, giving customers more and growing the business'

The firm claimed this was due to high costs of renting its stores but an investigation uncovered payments made to the Netherlands and Switzerland for purchasing its coffee. 

The latest profit figures also are in stark contrast to comments made last year by UK boss Mark Fox, who said that the company needed to ‘get its mojo back’ before it returned to the black.

Yesterday he said: ‘Starbucks UK is now showing a profit before tax, representing an important milestone for the UK business.

‘The company’s strong performance is the result of a turnaround strategy that has focused on engaging with our employees, giving customers more, growing the business and improving our model by rebalancing the store portfolio and carefully managing costs.’

The Seattle-based chain, which first opened in Britain on London’s Kings Road, said that over the past three years it had closed 67 unprofitable cafes.

But it has opened more Starbucks franchises that have cheaper running costs.

Mr Fox said Britain is the firm’s largest market across Europe.

Tax accountant Richard Murphy said choosing not to reveal its sales figure was ‘rather odd’.

He said: ‘We have consistently said that the way to avoid criticism is to give us all of the information, and be transparent. Starbucks haven’t given us the information.’

The European Commission has been investigating links between the Netherlands and companies that base themselves in the country for tax purposes.

Starbucks moved its European headquarters to the UK from the Netherlands last year, just as the Brussels began investigating its tax affairs.

But it still brews all of its European coffee in the country before selling it on to its businesses in other parts of the world, including the UK.
