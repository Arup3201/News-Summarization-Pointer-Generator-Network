US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has proposed reducing the US Army to its smallest size since before World War Two.

Under the Hagel plan, which Congress could 
change, the active-duty Army would shrink from its current 522,000 
soldiers to between 440,000 and 450,000. That would make it the smallest
 since just before the U.S. entered World War II in 1940.

The proposal is based around both spending concerns -- as well as President Obama's promises to end two different long-term military campaigns.

News of the drone's ability comes after U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced plans to reduce the nation's army to its smallest size since before World War Two

Army leaders have been
 saying for months that they expect their size would shrink as the 
nation prepares to end its combat role in Afghanistan this year.

Gen.
 Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said recently that whatever the 
future size of the Army, it must adapt to conditions that are different 
from what many soldiers have become accustomed to during more than a 
decade of war. He said many have the misperception that the Army is no 
longer busy.

"People tend to think that the 
Army is out of Iraq and Afghanistan, and there is not much going on," he
 said Jan. 23 at an Army forum. "The Army is not standing still. The 
Army is doing many, many, many things in order for us to shape the 
future environment and prevent conflict around the world."

Hagel is expected to propose the elimination of Air Force A-10 attack aircraft, like the one seen in this file photo

The budget, however, is expected to have money for the F-35 warplane, like the one seen in this file photo

The
 last time the active-duty Army was below 500,000 was in 2005, when it 
stood at 492,000. Its post-World War II low was 480,000 in 2001, 
according to historical tables provided by the Army on Monday. In 1940 
the Army had 267,000 active-duty members, and it surged to 1.46 million 
the following year as the U.S. approached entry into World War II.

Navy
 Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Monday that 
Hagel consulted closely with the military service chiefs on how to 
balance defense and budget-saving requirements.

"He
 has worked hard with the services to ensure that we continue to stand 
for the defense of our national interests - that whatever budget 
priorities we establish, we do so in keeping with our defense strategy 
and with a strong commitment to the men and women in uniform and to 
their families, Kirby said.

"But he has also 
said that we have to face the realities of our time. We must be 
pragmatic. We can't escape tough choices. He and the chiefs are willing 
to make those choices," Kirby said.

Proposed change may include scheduled drop of troops from 570,000 post-9/11 to between 440,000 and 450,000

@highlight

Would be the smallest army since 1940

@highlight

Budget cuts could mean higher casualties and a longer time for success if the US army had to handle two military campaigns at the same time again

Also expected are reduced housing allowances, increased health-care premiums, and limited pay raises
