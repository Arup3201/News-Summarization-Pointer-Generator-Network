A Detroit mother was overcome with tears after her son returned from US Army service abroad and surprised her in front of thousands at an NBA game. 

Denise Edwards was sitting courtside to see the Detroit Pistons play the Chicago Bulls when her son Damon Bledsoe, came back from a year's service in South Korea to give her a hug.

Singing legend Gloria Gaynor, who performed her hit song I Will Survive at the game, acknowledged Ms Edwards before saying that the team's Hoops for Troops initiative had a surprise for her.

Her son appeared as fans at The Palace erupted in cheers for the serviceman carrying flowers to give his mother, who struggled to speak as they embraced during the reunion.

Private First Class Bledsoe, 19, had written to the Pistons explaining all of the sacrifices his mother has made for him before he came home on leave.

The Pistons beat the  Bulls 107-91 on Saturday night.
