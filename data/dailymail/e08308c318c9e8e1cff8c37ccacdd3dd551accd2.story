Hearing: Lori Douglas faces losing her job as a Manitoba associate chief justice after her lawyer husband posted sexually explicit photos of her online

A divorce lawyer has told a court how he liked to take sexually explicit photographs of his wife, a senior judge, and post them on an adult dating website.

Jack King, from Winnipeg, Canada, has already admitted placing the photos online and harassing a black client to have sex with his wife, Lori Douglas, saying she was seeking an interracial affair.

He was last year fined CAD$13,650 ($13,400 / £8,630) by the Law Society of Manitoba after pleading guilty to professional misconduct but kept his licence to practice law.

But Ms Douglas still faces losing her job as a Manitoba associate chief justice.

Mr King, who has previously 
described his behaviour as 'disgraceful', yesterday told a Canadian 
Judicial Council inquiry: 'I think it was around 100 to 150 photos.

'A lot of it was weather-related. If it was warm outside, if it was sunny outside, one could be outside naked.'

Both
 Mr King and Ms Douglas claim that he posted the explicit photos on 
adult website DarkCavern.com without her knowledge in 2003 and that she 
had no idea he was asking men to have sex with her.

The images reportedly showed a naked Ms Douglas posing with sex toys and performing sex acts.

Mr
 King told the hearing that his wife may not even have been aware that 
he kept the photos, which he stashed away in an envelope at the bottom 
of his sock drawer.

He said: 'I did not tell her that they were there. I deduced that she did not know that they were there.'

The scandal started when Mr King represented computer programmer Alexander Chapman in his divorce case.

Mr
 Chapman said his attorney then sent him explicit photographs of his 
wife, as well as links to where they were posted on the adult website in
 an ad seeking black or Hispanic men for sex.

'I
 wanted to puke,' Mr Chapman said two years ago. 'They were disgusting. I
 felt sick because I couldn't believe my lawyer was saying this to me.'

Mr
 Chapman said Mr King spent numerous weeks trying to lure him into 
having sex with his wife. He claimed he met the couple - but never took 
it any further.

He said: 'As a black guy I'm really sad that he looked at me as a sex object.'

After
 his divorce was finalised in 2003, Mr Chapman told Mr King's law firm -
 Thompson Dorfman Sweatman - and was paid CAD$25,000 ($24,500 / £15,800) by his lawyer in 
compensation.

But Mr 
Chapman broke that settlement and went public with the scandal in 2010, 
claiming he was 'discouraged by the administration of justice in 
Manitoba' in 2003 and seeking CAD$67million ($65.7million / £42.4million) in compensation.

After Mr King's disciplinary hearing last year, his wife now faces four allegations, reports the Montreal Gazette.

She is accused of sexually harassing 
Mr Chapman; failing to disclose the situation when she was interviewed 
for judicial appointment in 2005; failing to disclose the full facts to 
an inquiry; and that the photos have undermined her ability to act as a 
judge.

Ms Douglas denies all the charges.
