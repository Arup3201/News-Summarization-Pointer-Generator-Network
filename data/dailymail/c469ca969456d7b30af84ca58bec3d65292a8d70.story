Accused: Marilyn Edge, 42, allegedly killed her two children after losing custody of them

A woman charged with killing her 13-year-old autistic son and 9-year-old daughter in the midst of a custody dispute has asked a judge for the death penalty during her first court appearance since her arrest.

Marilyn Edge, 42, looked dishevelled during her video appearance on Tuesday as she was arraigned on two counts of murder with special circumstances.

When Orange County Superior Court Judge Craig Robison asked if she wanted her arraignment postponed to October 25, Edge twice said, 'Only if you promise me the death penalty.'

Edge could be eligible for the death penalty if convicted. The judge postponed her arraignment.

A phone call seeking comment from Edge's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Arlene Speiser, was not immediately returned.

One special circumstance allegation filed by prosecutors claims the children were poisoned.

Deputy District Attorney Sonia Balleste would only say there was evidence of poisoning found in the hotel room where the bodies of Edge's daughter Faith and son Jaelen were discovered.

An autopsy has been performed, but toxicology tests are pending.

Asked about her reaction to Edge's request for the death penalty, Balleste said: 'The only death penalty I've seen her be efficient at was the death of her children. All the rest is just talk.'

Edge, of Scottsdale, Arizona, lost 
custody of the children on Wednesday in a Georgia case then texted her 
ex-husband, Mark Edge, two days later that she would bring the children 
back on Sunda., The children were found Saturday in the Santa Ana hotel.

Mark Edge was informed about the death of the children early Sunday by Atlanta police and was taken to a hospital for duress.

Marilyn Edge was driving a car that crashed Saturday into an electrical box outside a shopping complex in Costa Mesa.

She
refused to get out of the car and tried to choke herself with an 
electrical cord as rescuers attempted to free her, Santa Ana police Cpl.
Anthony Bertagna said.

Police
found propane in the car but wouldn't say whether there was a suicide 
note. Authorities said Edge told investigators they could find her 
children's bodies at the hotel.

The
Edges were married for less than 10 years and divorced in December 
2007, Weeks said. Marilyn Edge claimed her former husband, who routinely
traveled to Afghanistan where he worked as a contractor, failed to make
child support payments, according to court records.

Marilyn Edge was given full custody of her children in October 2009.

In
September, a judge reduced child support payments and ordered joint 
custody. Marilyn Edge moved to Arizona shortly after the judge's order, 
saying she was getting a job transfer.

Shocking: One hotel guest called the killings 'horrendous' and 'a heartbreaker'

At
a September 11 hearing in Georgia, a judge found that Marilyn Edge was 
alienating her children from her ex-husband and said he should be given 
full custody, Weeks said.

The judge gave Edge until noon Sunday to turn over the children.

The double homicide left locals and hotel guests stunned.

'My
goodness if there's two children involved that's just horrendous to say
the least,' Mike Ramey told KABC. 'As a parent, it's just a 
heartbreaker.'
