Steven Naismith claims he is no longer in awe of his Everton team-mates and feels he belongs in the Premier League.

The 27-year-old was signed for the Toffees by David Moyes but has blossomed under his successor Roberto Martinez.   

And now the former Rangers man said he felt as though he truly belonged in the side. Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, he said: 'I always believed I could play at this level.

Home: Steven Naismith said that he feels comfortable at Everton and is no longer in awe of team-mates

'In the past I've played in the Champions League and in big games for my country and I've always showed up well.

'I take a bit of time to settle into new surroundings and that's what happened here. I feel confident in anyone's company now.'

'Even when (Samuel) Eto'o joined. You are in awe of him because of what he achieved in the game, but you link well in training and you settle.

Premier League: Naismith claimed that many Scottish players felt as if they didn't belong in England

'When I first moved I definitely felt a bit inferior.

'It's been a problem for Scots boys in the past and I was the same. Looking around the squad you think to yourself, "should I be here?" 

But as you get more comfortable with the lads on and off the field things begin to go for you. I feel I belong here now.'

Big matches: Naismith has played in the Champions League, unlike many of his team-mates
