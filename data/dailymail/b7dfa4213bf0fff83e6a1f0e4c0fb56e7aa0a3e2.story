A hairdresser in China lost his temper with an unhappy customer and stabbed him in the chest.

The unnamed male customer was unhappy with his cut, so the hairdresser pierced him with a pair of scissors at a salon in Beijing.

The hairdresser, only named as Bao, can be seen on CCTV footage running over to the customer as he sits in his chair, plunging the scissors into his chest.

The customer reportedly told the stylist he was not impressed with his work, which sent Bao over the edge.

His colleagues told police that he had only been working in the salon for four days when he attacked the customer, Shanghaiist reports.

Bao was locked up in a room by his colleagues, but managed to flee the scene through a window before police arrived.

The victim had to undergo surgery as the scissors caused damage to his lung, but is recovering in hospital.

Bao fled the scene, but Beijing police have issued a call for his arrest.

This is not the first time unhappy customers have fallen victim to physical attacks in China.

Last year, when travellers at Beijing Airport complained about a boarding gate mix up, a customer service manager attempted to throw a metal chair on the crowd.

After an angry customer threw a water bottle at the manager, he had to be restrained by two people as he tried to retaliate against the man.

When he finally managed to wiggle free, he picked up the metal chair, swinging it above his head to attack the complaining man in front of him, before he was stopped.

Overreacting? The whole event was captured on the Beijing salon's CCTV camera
