One family is guaranteed a white Christmas thanks to the delivery of ten tonnes of snow.

Tracy Kirkton won a competition to have her garden turned into a 'winter wonderland' and says she is looking forward to seeing her daughters play in the snow on Christmas morning.

The competition was run by Real Radio and Snow Factor, the indoor ski slope at Braehead shopping centre, Glasgow.

Sisters Chelsey-Lee, six, Charlee, four, and one-year-old Summer jumped in the snow as soon as it arrived at their home in Kirkcaldy, Fife. They then helped staff from Snow Factor build a mini ski slope.

Ms Kirkton said: 'Waking up to snow on Christmas morning is something that every parent and their children dream of, and to be the only family in Scotland to have it come true is amazing.

'The girls are so excited to be able to build a snowman on Christmas Day, and we expect every kid in the area will be at our door on Christmas morning.'

Officially, a white Christmas is defined as just one single snowflake falling from the sky.

But those hoping to bring the sledge down from the loft this year or dress a snowman with scarf and hat might be a little disappointed - unless you live in the mountains of Scotland.

Christmas 2010 was the last white Christmas. With a thick layer of snow coating the nation, it was extremely unusual.

Snow on the ground was recorded at 83 per cent of stations, the highest ever recorded, and snow or sleet also fell at 19 per cent of stations.
