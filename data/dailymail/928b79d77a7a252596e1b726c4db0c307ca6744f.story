Grieving: Mr Martinez's wife and daughter were killed in a home invasion in April and he was severely beaten

The husband and father who woke up in 
his Las Vegas home to find his wife and daughter beaten to death said Thursday that he has taken the unfathomable step of forgiving their attacker.

Still bearing the scars of the brutal attack which left him requiring two major brain surgeries after 17 head fractures, Arturo
 Martinez appeared at a press conference three months after the random claw hammer attack. 

To gasps from the shocked audience, Mr Martinez said that he would even let  22-year-old Bryan Clay, who broke into their home 
randomly before raping and killing Mr Martinez's wife and 10-year-old 
daughter, kiss him on the cheek.

An emotional Mr Martinez said 'I forgive you. That's it, 
nothing else.'

'And if he gave me a kiss, I would give him a kiss.'

The Las Vegas Review Journal reports 
that Mr Martinez announced his decision in a press conference held 
in the boxing gym that he and his wife Ignacia, who went by Yardira, 
opened a year ago.

The gym
 was closed after the early morning attack on April 16. Mr Martinez does
 not remember the actual altercation between himself and Clay, but 
simply remembers waking up around 5am and seeing blood everywhere around
 his bedroom.

'After I saw this, I checked on my daughter and saw the same exact scene all over again,' he said.

Murdered: Police found the bodies of Ignacia 
Martinez, left, and her daughter Karla, right, who had also been raped 
in the brutal attack before being beaten to death with a claw hammer

He 
found his two young sons unharmed, and while attempting to call the 
police before passing out, he told his sons to go to school and tell the
 teachers what happened.

The killings caused panic in the 
neighborhood and surprised friends who knew Yardira, 38, and Arturo:
 because the couple were both professional fighters, community members 
were shocked that the assailant was able to defeat them still.

'I've
 been doing this for 24 years and this is the case you hope you never 
see,' Las Vegas Metropolitan Police lieutenant Ray Steiber said.

Because
 Clay was on the run and not found until a week after the attack, police
 immediately suspected Mr Martinez and put his sons in foster care.

Scars: The 17 head fractures Mr Martinez sustained during the attack prompted two major brain surgeries

Day in court: Shown surrounded by bailiffs in this May 2 photo, Bryan Clay has been charged with murder, kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon and sexual assault in the horrific Las Vegas attacks

Remembered: Mr Martinez said that he prays that 
his wife Yardira (left) and daughter Karla (right) are waiting for him 
in heaven

That was the 
case for three days before they were released into his custody, but 
since he was in the hospital recuperating for much of the month 
following the attack, the boys lived with Mr Martinez's sister and 
brother-in-law.

They now all live with their 
relatives, as Mr Martinez refuses to return to the home where his wife 
and daughter were killed, where his world was shattered.

During
 his brief statements, Mr Martinez was flanked on either side by his 
sons, 5-year-old Alejandro and 9-year-old Cristopher.

Cristopher
 could be seen stroking his father’s back during the statement and 
helping him when he got stuck on a difficult word- both because he was 
fighting back tears and because he is still recovering from his two 
brain surgeries.

Moving forward: Mr Martinez (right) and his sons now live in his sister's home because he cannot handle going back to the his family's home where the attack occurred

Horrific crime: Police arrested Bryan Clay, right, about a week after the brutal 
rape and murder of Karla Martinez, left. DNA reportedly linked Clay to the murders, as well as a sex assault the day before

'This terrible crime is just one of many evil things in our world,'  Mr Martinez said.

'It
 is my prayer that my wife Yardira and my daughter Karla are in heaven 
waiting for me and my sons, for me to arrive to spend eternity with 
them.'

When police found 
Clay, they connected him to a sexual assault against a different 
50-year-old woman the week before the killings.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.
