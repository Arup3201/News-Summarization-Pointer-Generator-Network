A personal trainer in Texas who once served as a peace officer has found himself on the wrong side of the law after he was caught on a hidden camera breaking into one of his client's truck and allegedly stealing money while the man was inside of the gym working out.

A few weeks ago, David Spivey noticed that money left inside his truck was continuously vanishing.

Initially, Spivey had thought that a family member was responsible for stealing the money, so he hatched a plan to stick a hidden camera in his vehicle and wait for the culprit to strike again.

Spivey was shocked to discover that it wasn't a family member who had been repeatedly burglarizing his truck, rather it was his personal trainer, Reginald Wilson, and it happened in the parking lot of the gym where the two men met for Spivey's training sessions.

The video - which Spivey turned over to police and a local television station in Tyler, about 100 miles southeast of Dallas - shows Wilson entering his truck, opening the center console and taking something that Spivey says was money.

'It's pretty self explanatory; [Wilson's] hand went in empty and came out with green stuff,' Spivey says of the video during an interview with KLTV.

In addition to the camera Spivey planted inside the vehicle, he also had a friend waiting in the parking lot with another camera. That video also shows Wilson entering Spivey's truck and leaving with something in his hand.

'I have outside footage and I also have inside camera showing what I 
caught him doing,' Spivey says. 'It is what it is; I can't do anything 
about it. I'm just glad that it's not happening anymore.'

Spivey says he would often leave his wallet in his truck when he went into the gym to workout, thinking it would be safer there than in one of the gym's lockers.

'The only thing I ever took in there was the key. Who would have thought 
that somebody would go into my locker, get a key out and go in my truck?
 Especially my trainer,' he says.

'I mean it just goes to show you, you can't trust anybody,' Spivey continues.

Mystery solved: David Spivey initially thought family members were burglarizing his car until he installed a hidden camera to catch the thief

Spivey says that he's glad the mystery has been solved and he will continue to work out at the same gym - however, he'll most likely be hiring a new trainer.

'It took me a bunch of money to figure out it wasn't a family member, a 
bunch of time, a bunch of patience, and a bunch of good friends,' Spivey says.Â 

Wilson was hit with two counts of burglary of a vehicle. According to KLTV, he is no longer employed as a peace officer.
