A wounded 13-year-old girl and her dead baby sister were found in an Oregon hotel room Friday morning as police launched a desperate search for their mother, who is wanted in connection to the incident.

The two children were found by housekeeping at Surfsand Resort in Cannon Beach, Oregonlive.com reported.

Washington woman Jessica Smith, 40, may 
be involved, Cannon Beach Police Chief Jason 
Schermerhorn said.

'Housekeeping at the hotel had found a 13-year-old child that had critical cuts and a deceased infant,' Schermerhorn said in a release. The 13-year-old was flown to a hospital, he said.

The police put out an appeal for anyone who may have seen Smith, who is believed to be traveling in a gold SUV.

Smith may be in 'a Gold 2007 Chevy Suburban with WA license plate APX3141 associated with the incident,' Schermerhorn said.

In a press conference Friday afternoon, Schermerhorn said both the baby and the 13-year-old are Smith's daughters.

The girls' mother is a person of interest, he said - and it is not clear where she may be driving to.

'Our hearts go out to the family and it's always hard when there's children involved,' he said.

Schermerhorn told reporters Smith checked into the Surfsand Resort on July 30, and the two girls were discovered Friday morning at 9:40am.

There were no signs of forced entry into the hotel room, he said.

Schermerhorn said he could not provide a 
time of death for the baby girl. The 13-year-old girl went into surgery,
 he told reporters.Â 

'We don't know at this time what [weapons were used],' Schermerhorn said.

KPTV reported 'Smith's husband filed to end their marriage on June 30. She then filed a restraining order against him on July 17.'
