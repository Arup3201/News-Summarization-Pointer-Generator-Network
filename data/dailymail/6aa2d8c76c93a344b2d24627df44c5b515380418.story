The brutal hatchet attack on two NYPD officers by a U.S. Navy veteran is being considered an act of terror, the FBI's director has confirmed.

Zale Thompson was shot dead in a New York street last month after wounding one officer  in the head and slashing another in the arm.

FBI Director James Comey said Thompson had been watching Islamic State beheading videos and other radical jihadist material online, adding there is 'no doubt that played a role' in the attack.

'There is no doubt it was terrorism,' he added.

But Comey said Thompson had also been motivated by black power sentiments.

The 32-year-old appeared to be seeking 'inspiration from foreign terrorist sources like ISIL (ISIS), but there is also evidence he was focused on black separatist ideology', he added.

Comey also spoke of the wider threat to Americans from ISIS who he said were continuing with their aspirations to attack the U.S., although he said there was no specific plot at this stage.

Highlighting the terror group's 'slick' propaganda machine, he said: 'They broadcast their hate in 23 different languages.

'They are very active in social media so that that's the primary dimension of the ISIL threat.'

He made his comments a day after U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig was beheaded by ISIS in Syria, it was reported by NBC New York. 

A preliminary report into Thompson's October 23 assault initially concluded the 32-year-old, who used the name Zaim Farouq Abdul-malik on social media, was influenced by anti-government or black power sentiments. 

Thompson was arrested (seen here) in southern California six times between 2002 and 2003, likely for domestic disputes, New York Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said.

However, a four page intelligence report from the NYPD later confirmed Thompson's self-radicalisation and his creeping obsession with terror outfits such as Al Qaeda and ISIS. 

According to the report, seen by Fox News, Thompson, 'may have held a long-standing interest in violent jihad.' 

In their initial investigation, the NYPD discovered 277 online search terms by the former US Navy serviceman that referred directly to jihad.

The intelligence reports states that 'Thompson used internet search engines to query specific terms including but not limited to 'lone wolf', 'jihad' and 'jihad against the police.'

Thompson's chilling attack was carried out in complete silence before he was shot dead after running up to four officers in New York brandishing a hatchet, before wounding cop Kenneth Healey, 25, in the head, and slashing another in the arm.

Mr Healey was taken to hospital on in critical condition but has now been released.

While the report raises fears of more lone wolf attacks by self-radicalized Americans, 'there is no evidence that Thompson conspired with other individuals to carry out the attack.'

It reveals that Thompson's favorite internet searches were for terror groups such as al Qaeda, its Somalian branch, al-Shabaab and ISIS.

The NYPD also found that Thompson's searches online brought up terms such as 'jihad against the infidels,' and 'fatwa against Americans' and 'death to America in Arabic.'

Others searches such as 'is Saudi Arabia a member of the United Nations' and 'Saudi Arabic 69th general assembly un' raise the frightening possibility that Thompson may have wanted to target the United Nations in New York City.

Investigators say Thompson stalked cops for hours in New York before launching his assault as they were having their pictures taken - wounding Kenneth Healey (second left) in the head

Also added as part of the report is a photograph which shows that Thompson was stalking the four cops before the attack on the streets.

In addition to the serious injuries Officer Healey suffered, Officer Joseph Meeker, 24, was also struck in the arm. Both are now recovering. 

'This was jihadist inspired. Plain and simple,' said Frank Cilluffo, associate vice president and director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute of George Washington University to Fox News.

'He had so many search terms in this respect, I think it would be very difficult to suggest that it's anything but.'

After the twin attack on Canadian soldiers last month, the NYPD has said it is stepping up its protocols and safety procedures.

'As I understand it, NYPD is already instituting new actions, and new steps where instead of patrolling alone, they are going to have group patrols, and stay together even, even simple measures such as having lunch. They are hoping that people will stick together, so you can have two eyes and ears on potential threat,' Cilluffo said.

Chilling pictures taken seconds before the October 23 attacks show Mr Healy standing along with four fellow officers before they were attacked by Thompson.

Dominick Williams took the photos after spotting the officers and asking them to stand for a picture.

Seconds later, Thompson ran up to the cops - who where standing against a wall in Jamaica, Queens - and started swinging a sharp hand axe.

Mr Healey, a rookie who had been on the force for just four months before he was injured, was taken to hospital in critical condition but has since recovered

Weapon: This is the hatchet that Thompson used to carry out his attack on the two cops in Queens, New York City

Mr Williams says he scrambled for safety as the officers wrestled with Thompson. He hacked Officer Joseph Meeker, 24, in the arm before burying the hatchet in Healey's skull.

Mr Williams' camera captured the frantic aftermath of the attack.

Officer Healey - who had just four months on the job - can be seen laying face down on the sidewalk - a bloody gash in his head.

Another officer can be seen tending to his fallen comrade, holding a cloth over the head wound.

The pictures also capture Thompson dead on the sidewalk. His body is face up with the hatchet, still in his had, laid across his chest.
