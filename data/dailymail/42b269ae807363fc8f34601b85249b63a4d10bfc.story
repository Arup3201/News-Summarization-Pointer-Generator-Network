There is another fight of significance for British boxing taking place here, in Las Vegas, on Saturday.

Amir Khan will be the star attraction as he battles Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand Garden. But just a stroll down the Las Vegas Strip at the Cosmopolitan, Ireland’s Andy Lee will be taking on Matt Korobov for the vacant WBO middleweight title.

Billy Joe Saunders, whose victory over Chris Eubank Jnr established him as the mandatory challenger to the winner, will be in London watching with keen interest.

Not only is his big chance coming, at just 25, but if Lee prevails he will beat both Saunders and Tyson Fury in the race to be the first member of the travelling community to win a world title.

Even so, Saunders will be rooting for Lee. ‘We’re mates and I won’t be jealous if he pulls it off,’ he said. ‘I will be delighted for him. And if he does come through it will make for a massive domestic fight for us next year.’

Lee, whose only previous world-title shot ended in defeat against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr, is again the underdog.

Korobov enjoyed a stellar amateur career, winning multiple world titles. But it has taken the talented Russian time to adapt to the professional ring.

However, he seems to have settled into the paid ranks now and is a heavy betting favourite to see off Lee.

Saunders sees it differently, believing Korobov would be the easier opponent and saying: ‘I think his style would suit me perfectly. He’s good but the way to beat him is to keep him busy, keep the pressure on, wear him down — and that’s what he will get from me if we meet.

‘With Andy you have to bring your A-game or you’ll be in trouble. He will be dangerous in the first few rounds.’

Nevertheless, Saunders slightly favours Korobov to prevail, saying: ‘I keep wavering between the two but in the end I think Korobov will edge it on points.’
