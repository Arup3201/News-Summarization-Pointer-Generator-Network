Promoter Frank Warren believes heavyweight Tyson Fury has what it takes to dethrone world champion Wladimir Klitschko.

Fury swept aside the threat Dereck Chisora posed on Saturday night at the ExCel in London's Docklands to win his first European heavyweight title and earn the reward of a contest against Klitschko in 2015.

Klitschko, who holds the WBO, WBA and IBF belts, is set to go up against the 6ft 9ins challenger, and Warren feels Fury has the potential to beat the Ukrainian after Chisora learned the hard way.

'I told Don (Charles, Chisora's trainer) to stop the fight after the 10th round, as it was quite apparent there'd be no change in the way things were going,' Warren told the Telegraph.

'His jab was non-existent and he couldn't cope with Fury's height and size. Chisora wasn't happy – he's a warrior and a very tough guy. He had three stitches under his eye and his nose may be broken.'

Fury has questioned whether Klitschko will take to the bout next year, but Warren is confident.  

'It will happen,' he continues. 'The WBO have mandated it will happen. Klitschko's next fight is in March and after that there's 30 days for us to negotiate with him.

'Tyson will bring back a world title for Britain. He's able to switch his tactics up, he's got that much potential.'
