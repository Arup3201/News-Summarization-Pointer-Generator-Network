Former
Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly won an employment tribunal 
against the BBC on the grounds of ageism after she was replaced by a 
younger host.

The 56-year-old has also claimed to be a victim of sexual harassment at the hands of a senior BBC executive.

The
BBC is long on soul-searching but short on culture change. I wish I 
could say I was surprised to read these shocking accounts of bullying 
and sexual harassment, but sadly I’m not.

More than 930 people gave evidence to the Dinah Rose inquiry.

Some have now withdrawn it because they have no faith in BBC promises that they won’t be penalised for speaking out.

Age discrimination: Miriam O'Reilly

At open sessions held 
for staff to discuss their experiences of harassment and bullying 
there’s been silence – no one except union representatives have felt 
they can speak openly without facing repercussions.

After
the Respect at Work Review was published, one highranking staff member 
left the Corporation, accepting her career had effectively come to an 
end because she had voiced her concerns over an issue that subsequently 
tarnished the BBC’s reputation.

Measures
introduced after the Rose inquiry were designed to cut the grievance 
procedure for sexual harassment and bullying complaints from 90 to 30 
days.

But the deliberation time has doubled to 180 days and some serious cases have not been resolved at all.

Staff
who were brave in coming forward with their experiences now feel the 
people who made their lives a misery at work will get off lightly 
because there is no real will by human resources to get to the truth.

Damning: A BBC dossier was compiled by the National Union of Journalists and was one of the pieces of evidence submitted to senior managers at the BBC last December

I gave evidence to the Rose inquiry about a manager who offered me a job, but I then found out he wanted sexual favours in return.

When
I went to see two senior members of staff for advice about bringing a 
formal complaint, they warned me that the BBC would always side with its
managers and that if I went ahead it would be unlikely that I would 
work for the Corporation again.

I was a freelancer at the time and could not afford to take the risk.

The BBC is a national treasure. In terms of the quality of its news output, it can’t be beaten.

But the viewing public has to know that behind this facade a culture of fear is allowed to thrive.

This is because executives are a power unto themselves.

They stick together and guard each other’s backs.
