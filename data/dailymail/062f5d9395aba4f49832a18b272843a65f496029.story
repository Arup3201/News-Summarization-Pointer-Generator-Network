Jailed Australian journalist Peter Greste has spoken to his family from his cramped Egyptian jail cell - for the first time since his sentencing - where he is spending up to '23 hours a day' locked inside.

Speaking with brother Andrew following his shock seven-year guilty verdict for aiding the outlawed Muslim brotherhood, Peter has told him about his torment at receiving the sentence which has sparked international outcry and begun dialogue between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the Egyptian Government.

Andrew Greste, who appeared on Channel Nine's Today Show, described the cramped conditions of Peter's Tora prison cell, in Cairo, where he is spending close to every hour of the day locked inside. 'He is in a cell that's three metres by four metres in dimension,' Andrew said.

Peter Greste told his brother Andrew he was shattered at his seven-year guilty verdict handed down by an Egyptian judge

'There's a double bunk be and a single bunk bed within that space as well as a small screened off area where there's a toilet, shower and wash basin and they spend 23-hours a day in that cell.'

Andrew said he and other brother Mike were not able to see Peter amid the chaotic scenes of Monday's sentencing as he was whisked away from the mesh cage in which he was locked in the courtroom.

Peter, along with his two other Al Jazeera English colleagues, was sentenced to seven years in jail after he was found guilty of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's political situation, aligning himself with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.

His brother Andrew said Peter was feeling 'shattered and outraged' at the sentencing but has vowed to keep up the fight to ensure his release. He said despite the unexpected jail term, Peter was keeping mentally strong.

'He is pretty shattered, outraged - all those words to describe his emotions,' he said. 'But on the flip side to that he is still mentally strong and holding it together and he has assured us he is willing to keep up the fight.'

The three journalists, including Canadian-Egyptian acting Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian producer Baher Mohammed, were arrested on December 29 after a raid on their Cairo hotel they were using as an office and denied the accusations, saying they were just doing their job.

Monday's sentencing sparked and international outcry, particularly after Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi dashed hopes of a prompt resolution. He said local authorities 'will not interfere in judicial matters'.

The family of Peter had previously said that appealing for a presidential pardon was one of the first things they would consider in the campaign to free him. But with that no longer a prospect, the Greste's must now decide whether to lodge an appeal with the same judiciary that convicted him.

'It's been extremely stressful, emotional and anxious,' Andrew said.

'Peter has shown remarkable strength and remarkable integrity through the whole process and respected the whole process, the Egyptian legal system, we've taken a lot of strength from Peter's courage and dignity.'

It is anticipated that he will be upgraded to a better complex where his conditions are expected to improved, but where visits from his family may be reduced. Presently the family are free to visit Peter once a week but that may soon be limited to once a fortnight.

Both Andrew and brother Mike Greste will continue splitting their time between Egypt and Australia to support Peter, and keep him informed about the next step in efforts to secure his release.
