Former Hey Dad! co-star Sarah Monahan, 36, spoke out against Robert Hughes in a very personal interview on 2day FM this Thursday.

The former child star was one of the many victims who suffered Hughes' sexual abuse on the set of Hey Dad!, which began to air in 1987.

In her interview, Ms Monahan revealed what she would like to happen to Hughes, 65, who was convicted of 10 child sex offences on Tuesday.

'I would definitely sentence him to jail and I wouldn't give him one of the cushy jails,' Ms Monahan said.

'I definitely think he needs to go to a place where he thinks about what he's done and realises that maybe he's not the most awesome human being on the planet, and that...he realises he's just a piece of s**t.'

Monahan, now living in San Antonio, Texas, was only 10 years old when she claims Hughes first exposed himself in front of her.

She told the Sydney's Downing Centre court that the convicted sex offender would inappropriately grope her and expose himself to her during production breaks on the set of Hey Dad!

During her interview on 2Day FM, the ex-child star also commented on Hughes' non-remorseful demeanor during his trial.

'I think that the fact that he's still just so adamantly denying it, he's almost denying the other girls that right to heal a little bit,' she said.

Monahan's bravery was praised by 2Day FM show host Sophie Monk, due to choosing to see her abuser face to face in order to help bring her some closure over the ordeal.

When asked how she felt about finally seeing the actor again, Monahan described how she was sickened by the sight of Hughes.

'I just wanted to throw up most of the time really...by the third day I couldn't eat, the police would bring me lunch and I just couldn't eat at all...' she said.

'I thought at least when I speak and I'm right there, he has to look back at me to see me say those things, and so I kind of big dogged him at one point because the first couple of days he was staring me down and I couldn't look at him. Then I started looking at him, and he stopped looking back.'

Ms Monahan, who described the court process as an 'awful... soul- crushing experience' said that she was going home on Sunday, having had enough of the whole ordeal.

'[I] don't want to deal with it anymore,' she said, describing how she had initially wanted to 'tell people and yell' after being forced to stop communicating about what had happened to her, so as not to influence the case during the police investigation.

Monahan first went public with her story of abuse four years ago in a Woman's Day article in March 2010.

'I was asked to speak and I finally started talking and it was like a Pandora’s Box, because when you start talking it's kind of hard to stop,' she said.

Now part of a campaign that calls for a public register of sex offenders across Australia, Monahan left the show by encouraging victims of child sexual assault to speak up against their perpetrators.

'Don’t let them continue doing it, because it’s not just you, like we’ve seen here. They say for every paedophile that gets done, it takes 60 people before someone speaks up,' she said.

Monahan was one of the principal cast members of TV sitcom Hey Dad! who appeared on A Current Affair on Wednesday night, following leading actor Hughes, 65, being convicted of child sex offences on Tuesday.

Some of the show's former actors say members of the Australian acting industry ostracised them after they spoke out about Robert Hughes' child sex abuse.

Actor Ben Oxenbould said acting contacts he had known for 30 years turned their back on him when he spoke out in support of his cast member, Monahan.

'Four years ago after we spoke I copped a lot of criticism from people, particularly in the industry saying you idiot you'll never work again,' he said.

'I've had Executive Producers say "Benny we wanted you for that role, but mate ..." and I think but mate what?  I'm not the bad guy here.

'My lesson in professionalism was "shut up about the paedophile".'
