Bravery: Paralyzed Alisha Waters has returned home four months after being shot by her husband repeatedly after he stalked her relentlessly for weeks

The Kentucky wife ambushed and shot five times by her estranged husband who then turned the gun on himself in front of her has vowed this week to walk again after the attack left her quadriplegic.

Alisha Waters' life changed forever on August 6 when her husband, Dennis Mathis, opened fire on her in the elevator at her work after threatening her for weeks through texts and online.

Left lying on the floor as the elevator door closed again and again on her, Waters survived - but is now paralyzed and is at the forefront of a state campaign to get cyberstalking recognized as part of protective orders in Kentucky.

Arriving back home to live with her parents in Florence, Waters is now waiting for her father to finish converting the garage to help with her new disability.

Reflecting on the morning when she was shot, Waters told WCPO that her husband of five-years appeared from nowhere brandishing a firearm.

'I remember everything,' said Waters. 'I remember turning around, seeing him standing there with a gun pointed at me.'

Pleading with Mathis by using his nickname, DJ, Waters remembered that sadly it had no effect on her husband.

Not defeated: Alisha blames her estranged husband Dennis Mathis' (right) refusal to take his depression medication for his violent and suicidal actions on August 6

Recovery: Alisha has been living at Shepherd Center in Atlanta, a private, nonprofit hospital that specializes in spinal cord injuries, since October 9 and has now moved back in with her parents

Reason to live: Alisha barely survived the attempt on her life - but is desperate now to make sure that she gets an amendment to domestic violence legislation in Kentucky

'The next thing I know, he started firing.' said Waters whose spinal cord was severed by one of her husband's volleys.

Her husband unleashed four shots at her and then walked up to her in the elevator and fired one more shot.

'He fired one more shot and I remember looking back and seeing him put the gun to his head,' said Waters.

'I put my head down and the next thing I knew the medics were there.'

Before the shooting, Waters had faced the terrifying and relentless attentions of her husband - which followed their separation.

Mathis had texted Waters 186 times in two weeks before she sought an emergency protection order, but a judge refused because cyberstalking is not grounds for a domestic violence order in Kentucky.

If the judge had granted the order then Mathis would have been prevented from buying the gun in the store the very day before he shot her.

Strangely, Waters has sought to justify her husband's actions that day, by claiming that he had been declining to take his anti-depression medication.

'No. The D.J. I knew was a good person,' Alisha said.

Back at home, Waters and her family are battling for the creation of the Alisha Waters Law. They want domestic violence laws changed to include cyberstalking.

Waters believes she is meant to advocate for the increased protection.

'I’m always thinking about the Alisha Waters bill,' she said. 'I feel the need to protect other women – and men, for that matter – that in the future may get in the same position I found myself in,' said Waterst to Cincinnati.Com.

Now back at home, Waters is quadriplegic, with limited mobility of her right arm.

She needs a hospital bed, a mechanical wheelchair, a chair lift and a respirator.
