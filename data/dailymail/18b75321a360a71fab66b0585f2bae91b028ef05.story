Glugging booze, groping half-naked men, gurning in a hoodie at a pub table, all for the camera. A demure Duchess of Cambridge-type Cressida Bonas most definitely is not.

Racy photographs have emerged of Prince Harry’s winsome girlfriend on the town, pictures she would probably rather his wider family didn’t see.

There she is on the pages of last week’s Now magazine, hair in Heidi plaits, necking wine from a bottle, and downing something punchy from a shot glass.

In another photo, Cressida is running 
both hands down a sun-tanned, bare male chest and kissing a blonde 
female friend, who looks rather like her, on the lips. Or as Now 
helpfully puts it: ‘Blondes together: Cressie smooches with a gal pal!’

These unprincessy pictures are headlined ‘Whatever would the Queen say?’

Well,
the Queen might muse she has been here before, when another raffish 
‘spare’ linked himself with an exuberant party girl from a 
well-connected but very messy broken home.

Think
back to the early Nineties and the endless headlines about Prince 
Andrew’s wild bride, Sarah Ferguson, and it is easy to understand why 
friends of Harry and William are asking if Cressie is the new Fergie.

The
embarrassments which Fergie heaped upon the Royal Family are many and 
cringe-worthy. Who can forget the infamous front page ‘toe-sucking’ 
photographs with her American financial adviser Johnny Bryan in 1992? 
She had to flee Balmoral when the papers appeared.

Playboy
princes, it has to be said, are naturally attracted to party girls, and
party girls can find it hard to fit in with the Windsors.

Cressida is Blonde, bohemian and fun-loving, which is Harry's type but pictures of her such as the one left in a bikini and bright pink wig may cause concern 

In this picture published in Now Magazine, she is seen stroking the chest of a half-naked man

The pictures of Cressida downing shots were taken before her relationship with Prince Harry began

Of course Cressida’s youthful 
indiscretions — it is not even clear how old these pictures are, but the
latest is probably from 2011 — can hardly be compared with Fergie’s, 
who, at the point of the toe-sucking debacle, was already married with 
two children and well into her 30s. These pictures were taken long 
before Cressida was even a Royal girlfriend, let alone a wife, and she 
may never even become one.

Oddly enough, however, Fergie is 
centre stage in this Royal romance. She is a friend of Cressida’s 
mother, Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, and Princess Eugenie introduced the 
couple.

And it is Fergie who
is said to have urged Harry to propose to Cressida, although given her 
experience, you would think she would advise caution. Is this her way of
pitching herself, and her daughters, back into the centre stage of the 
Royal Family?

The romance 
seems to be continuing apace. Harry has introduced Cressida to William 
and Kate, and she has visited Kensington Palace many times. They have 
been to Richard Branson’s island of Necker together, not to mention the 
ski resort, Verbier.

The couple are both sporty,  outdoorsy types, and last week were spotted bowling at All Star Lanes in Bayswater.

The
relationship looks like it’s getting serious, but Cressida herself is 
said to think she is too young to marry yet. She is entitled to feel 
hesitant about marriage because, like Fergie’s parents, her mother and 
father have a spaghetti junction of marriages and affairs between them.

Like
Fergie, her mother didn’t make a smooth transition from single girl 
about town to happily married woman. The blonde beauty, daughter of the 
second wife of Earl Howe, a Conservative politician, was a socialite so 
celebrated that Claridge’s hotel named a cocktail after her.

But she was married — and divorced — 
four times. The first time she walked up the aisle she was 24, the age 
Cressida is now. Cressida’s father Jeffrey Bonas was husband number 
three, and Lady Mary Gaye was his second wife. A judge branded Bonas 
‘untrustworthy’ in his first divorce. Cressida was five when her parents
split.

So back to the here 
and now and those cringe-making photographs. If they look like 
attention-seeking, we have to put them into context.

Larking
about for the cameras is all the rage among bright young things at the 
moment, as the antics, to take an extreme example, of the ubiquitous 
upper crust Burberry model Cara Delevingne (who bears a confusing 
resemblance to family friend Cressida, being fair, pouty, willowy and 
bushy-eyebrowed) prove.

Cara is photographed pulling faces and
kissing girls — last week it was Sienna Miller’s turn, on the red 
carpet at Cannes — on a daily basis. Unlike Cressida, she knows those 
pictures will be everywhere. Even so, potential princesses aren’t 
usually caught smooching their friends.

There
are hundreds of pictures of Cressida larking about on the web.

For the 
first time, we have a potential princess from the social networking, 
picture-sharing generation.

So there’s Cressida in huge fluffy bunny 
ears, Cressida in pink wigs with bikinis, and in fancy dress at her 
sister’s wedding celebrations in Africa and Hampshire.

There is even one of her preparing to 
smooch Princess Eugenie. Other than when she is skiing, she seems quite 
resistant to full clothing, preferring tiny skirts, hot-pants and 
anything that frees her midriff — though as a dancer, she has certainly 
has the figure to wander around half-dressed.

You
wouldn’t have found any pictures like that of Kate Middleton before she
was married, although James and Pippa Middleton are happily cavorting 
in cyberspace for eternity in bras and loo roll (her) and nearly naked 
(him).

James and Pippa 
learned from their web exposure and have tried to be careful since. It 
is possible — probable? — that unlike Fergie, Cressida’s high jinks will
remind her she has to be more cautious now, and that there will never 
be a Bonas indiscretion ever again.

But she may decide she would rather be free to do what she likes.

As Prince Harry is known for his love 
of a wild night and his eagerness to shed his clothes, these pictures 
illustrate exactly why Harry is so drawn to Cressida Bonas.

He
has a type — like his long-term ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy, Cressida is a
red-blooded, bohemian blonde who likes a drink and a fag and a 
knees-up.

Demure types never attracted his Uncle Andrew either, whose pre-Fergie loves included soft porn star Koo Stark and model Katie Rabett.

Harry likes blonde beauties with a 
healthy dose of tomboy in their veins. With her fondness for trainers, 
beanie hats and minimal make-up, that’s Cressida. Certainly, after her 
brush with the spontaneous, party-loving Fergie, who she adored before 
it went so spectacularly wrong, the Queen —and Prince Philip — may feel a
little nervous at the thought of another fun-loving, free-spirited 
exhibitionist entering their ranks.

And
not only is Cressida a natural performer — she is studying dance at the
Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance — but she has been an 
actress, too, playing an effective Desdemona in a production of Othello 
at Leeds, and a string of lead parts in plays at her public school, 
Stowe.

She comes from a 
family who lap up the limelight. There is actress half-sister Isabella, 
who married Sam Branson in the most long-drawn out wedding of 2013.

There is half-sister, Gabriella Wilde, a model and actress thrown out of Heathfield school for smuggling in vodka. There is her It-boy brother, Jacobi — like Harry, a polo-playing party boy who loves blondes. And there are her parents, with six marriages between them.

On the other hand, most of these 
pictures were taken a while back, when Cressida was at Leeds University.
Leeds is notorious for its action-packed nightlife, something Cressida 
fully appreciated back then.

Her
university friend Jamie Laing, one of the ‘stars’ of that insufferable 
television show, Made In Chelsea, says they ‘partied their way through 
uni’. The rich kids who date and dump each other on the Fulham/Chelsea 
borders in the programme are very much Cressida’s set.

Friends
of Cressida have claimed she always preferred Leeds nightlife to 
London’s because in London no one really ‘lets go.’ Of course ‘letting 
go’ is precisely what everyone in the Royal family is afraid of.

Cressida has not made the same smooth transition into the public eye as Kate Middleton did

In Leeds, Cressida shared a house with five friends and liked going to see live music, festivals, and as a dance student, dancing, of course. Although she is four years Harry’s junior at 24, she is quite well travelled. She spent a year as a ski instructor and last summer went with her best friend to Australia after university.

She waitressed on Bondi Beach and at one point she and her friend Georgia Forbes ‘couchsurfed’ — moved around, staying on strangers’ sofas — with a man they met in a hotel. Then she came back to England and started her romance with Harry.

All her friends say Cressida is sweet, calm and good-natured. She might grow up into a girl who feels she can handle the Royals, particularly with the equally free-spirited Harry by her side.

So are the boozy antics little more than youthful over-exuberance, or is Cressida Bonas, Fergie number two? Only time will tell.
