Harry Potter author JK Rowling is to build her own 'Hagrid Hut' in the grounds of her Scottish estate.

The writer plans to install the stone-built summerhouse on the edge of the 19th century 162-acre Killiechassie estate near Aberfeldy, Perthshire.

Rowling bought the house and grounds for £1.9million in 2001 and married husband Dr Neil Murray in the library in the December of that year.

The application was approved by council planning officials last week.

Local authority documents show the author's vision of the structure, which bears a striking resemblance to the home of one of her most well-loved characters, Hagrid.

It will be a circular structure, open to the front, with a stone bench and slate roof.

Like the home of her fictional character - played by Robbie Coltrane in the Harry Potter films - the structure is also set on the edge of a forest.

The building is similar to fictional home of Hagrid, the Hogwarts caretaker made popular by Robbie Coltrane

The application has been approved by the council, as long as no trees are felled in its construction

Rowling bought the house and grounds in the beautiful Highlands location for £1.9million in 2001

A council report states that the condition of the application's approval is that no trees must be damaged or cut down during the construction.

Rowling has previously built similar tree-house structures in the grounds of her Edinburgh mansion.

The inter-connected tree houses are thought to have been built for her two youngest children.

Built on wooden stilts, the tree house features lanterns above the doors, balconies and carvings. Also built into the structure were a spiral staircase and a trapdoor. 

Her retreat has its own small loch, said to contain a murderous water sprite.
