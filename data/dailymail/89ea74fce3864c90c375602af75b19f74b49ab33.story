The News of the World's 'Fake Sheikh' told a court today how he uncovered a cricket match-fixing ring by posing as a wealthy businessman.

Mazhar Mahmood used a hidden camera to film a sports agent accepting £150,000 in return for Pakistani players bowling no balls in the Lord's Test against England, the court heard.

The agent, Mazhar Majeed, also allegedly said he could secure the involvement of Australian players in match-fixing.

Mr Mahmood, 48, investigations editor of the now-defunct Sunday tabloid, was allowed to give evidence from behind screens to jurors at Southwark Crown Court today in order to protect his identity.

It is alleged Majeed conspired with Pakistan's former Test captain, Salman Butt, 27, and fast bowlers Mohammad Asif, 28, and Mohammad Amir, 19, to bowl three deliberate no balls in the match.

Prosecutors claim Majeed also boasted of having three other corrupt players in his pocket willing to take part in match fixing and claimed to be able to throw matches for $1m.

The three players and agent have been accused of being key players in 'rampant corruption' at the heart of the international game.

Butt and Asif deny conspiracy to cheat and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments. Amir and Majeed are not before the jury.

Today the jury heard excerpts from a series of covert recordings made by Mr Mahmood during several meetings with Majeed.

At their initial meeting in August 2010, at which the reporter posed as a rich Indian businessman, they discussed organising a 'big money' tournament in the United Arab Emirates.

Majeed was heard saying that if the reporter could secure sponsorship and a guarantee a prize fund of £1m he could provide players from Pakistan and India willing to take part.

'You will find there are only a few players who are genuine and do it for the love of the game, and there's not many - they do it for the money,' he said.

'How much they get paid is a joke. They will be up for it. They will be up for making money. As long as there is prize money, good prize money.'

He also claimed that the cricketers had arranged the fixing in the first place, saying: 'The players will never tell anybody else. They're the ones that approached me about this. This is the beauty of it.

'I was friends with them for four or five years. And then they said this happens and I said "Really?" and I was so innocent of it.'

Majeed went on to allege that Australian players would fix 'brackets', a set period of a match on which punters bet on, for example, how many runs will be scored.

'The Australians, they are the biggest. They have 10 brackets a game,' he said in the tape played to the court.

Majeed was heard boasting throughout the meeting of his celebrity contacts including the actor Brad Pitt, former tennis World Number 1 Roger Federer and cricketing 'friends' Mike Gatting, Phil Tufnell and Geoffrey Boycott.

The jury heard that it was at this meeting the two men first discussed fixing.

Mr Mahmood was heard saying to Majeed he would need at least three players 'in on the betting side of things'. Majeed replied: 'Boss, I've got six.'

Prosecutors allege that Butt, Asif and Amir were three of the players allegedly willing to fix games.

The trial continues.
