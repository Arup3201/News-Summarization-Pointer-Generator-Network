Two men have been arrested by the Australian Federal Police over an alleged multi-million dollar insider trading scheme.

A 26-year-old National Australia Bank officer and a 24-year-old Australian Bureau of Stastics employee allegedly profited themselves $7 million over a nine month period.

The men have been charged with offences relating to insider trading, money laundering, corruption and abuse of public office.

The arrests came as a result of a joint AFP and Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) operation.

The operation commenced after suspicious foreign exchange derivative trading was identified, with the taskforce continuing to monitor up until today.

The men were able to profit the $7 million between August 2013 and May 2014.

Early on Friday, the AFP and ASIC executed eight search warrants at both of the men's properties and arrested the pair in the process.

Included in the items seized was $9,000 in cash.

Meanwhile, the 24-year-old Canberra man, based in Belconnen, has been charged with abuse of public office, releasing sensitive information, receiving a corrupt benefit and insider trading.

‘The AFP and ASIC have worked together closely on this serious and complex investigation, utilising the resources and expertise of both agencies to bring about today's arrests,’ AFP Acting National Manager Crime Operations Ian McCartney said.

‘Investigations like this send a clear message to anyone who is thinking of engaging in this type of criminal activity - we have the ability to monitor you and take action, as we've done today.’

The National Australia Bank and Australian Bureau of Statistics fully cooperated with the investigation.

When phoned for comment, a spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police said no further charges would be brought against the pair.

The men, who were university friends, are fronting court in Melbourne and Canberra on Friday.
