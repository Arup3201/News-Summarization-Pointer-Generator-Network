Sean Bean has been arrested after allegedly harassing his former wife.

The actor was questioned by police over claims he made abusive phone calls and sent text messages to Georgina Sutcliffe, 34.

Bean, 53, a father of three who made his name in ITV’s Napoleonic drama Sharpe and starred in Hollywood blockbuster Lord of the Rings, handed himself in to Holborn police station in Central London on Wednesday for a pre-arranged interview.

He gave DNA and fingerprint samples and was bailed as officers continued to investigate the claims.

Miss Sutcliffe, who is acting in Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap in the West End, was Bean’s fourth wife.

The pair met in 2003 when she was 
managing the bar in a West End theatre in which Bean was playing 
Macbeth. They married at Marylebone Register Office in London in 2008 
and shared a house in Belsize Park, North London, but reportedly 
separated in the first year of their marriage, before getting back 
together.

Two years later they divorced, citing 
‘irreconcilable differences’. Bean was previously married to hairdresser
Debra James and actresses Melanie Hill and Abigail Cruttenden. He wed 
school sweetheart Miss James when he was just 21, but the marriage 
collapsed after he moved from Sheffield to London to study at the Royal 
Academy of Dramatic Art. They divorced in 1988.

The actor was then married to Miss 
Hill for seven years, and had two daughters. Soon after they split, he 
confirmed he was dating Miss Cruttenden, who he met on the set of 
Sharpe. They had a daughter in 1998 but divorced two years later.

Last year the actor said that he had finally given up on marriage, saying he preferred spending his time gardening.

‘Of course I believe in love despite 
four divorces. There is nobody who doesn’t believe in love,’ he said. 
‘But marriage – that fits some people but obviously not me. I love doing
just nothing in my free time. I love to be with my kid in Yorkshire. I 
love it there. Working in a garden calms me down.’

Last year Bean was ‘stabbed’ in the 
arm outside a North London pub following a row over glamour model April 
Summers, who is 30 years his junior.

He suffered a cut arm and a bruised face, according to witnesses, but declined to attend hospital

Instead, the star walked back into the bar and, after staff gave him treatment from a first aid kit, ordered another drink.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A 53-year-old man attended a London 
police station for a pre-arranged interview. He was bailed pending 
further inquiries. He was arrested on suspicion of harassment.’

The Daily Mail was unable to contact Bean at his home for a comment yesterday.

A man who answered the intercom at the town house said the actor was not at the address.

Bean’s representatives were not available for comment.
