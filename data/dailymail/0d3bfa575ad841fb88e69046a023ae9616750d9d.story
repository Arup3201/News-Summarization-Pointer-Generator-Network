For Nike it was an innocent name designed to chime with the often boozy St Patrick’s Day celebrations.

To others, however, it was a historical affront reviving bitter memories of a British unit sent to Ireland to suppress revolt in the 1920s.

Nike has launched its new £70 ‘beer-themed’ trainer ‘The Black and Tan’ just in time for St Patrick’s Day on Saturday.

Controversial: Nike has provoked outrage by launching a new Black and Tan line of trainers for St Patrick's Day

But the U.S sportswear firm has been 
accused of ‘huge insensitivity’ because the Black and Tans was the 
nickname given to the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force, which 
became notorious for a brutal crackdown during the independence war.

One outraged Irish American claimed it was the equivalent of calling a shoe ‘the Al Qaeda’.

The trainer is officially called the 
Nike SB Dunk Low, but has been nicknamed The Black and Tan for its 
colourings. An advertisement for the shoe says: ‘Tis the season for 
Irish beer and why not celebrate with Nike.

‘The Black and Tan sneaker takes inspiration for the fine balancing act of a stout on top a pale ale in a pint glass.’

Others Irish Americans criticised Nike for being ‘oblivious’ to the historical connotation.

Ciaran Staunton, president of the 
U.S.-based Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, asked: ‘Is there no one 
at Nike able to Google Black and Tan?’ Yesterday, Nike apologised for 
the name.

Scandalous: It was the equivalent of calling a shoe 'the Al Qaeda', one leading Irish American said

The Black and Tans (right) were an ad hoc paramilitary units, of British World War I veterans, employed by the Royal Irish Constabulary.

They
were created after the First World War by Winston Churchill, faced with
a increasing tide of violence from the IRA which had launched a 
campaign to drive Britain out of Ireland.

Although established to target the 
Irish Republican Army, they became notorious through their
numerous attacks on the Irish civilian population.

They were ordered, as Temporary Constables from 1920 to 1921, to suppress revolution in Ireland.

The Catholic cardinal of the day called them 'a horde of savages, some of them simply brigands, burglars and thieves'.

The unit's nickname arose from the colour of the improvised khaki uniforms initially worn by its members.

Black and Tan is also the name given to a popular drink made by mixing stout and pale ale - usually Guinness and Harp or Bass.

A spokesman said: ‘It is not the official name of the shoe. It
has been unofficially named by some using the phrase and we recognise 
it can be viewed as inappropriate and insensitive. We apologise and no 
offence was intended.’

Six years ago ice cream firm Ben 
& Jerry’s caused a furore when it launched a Black and Tan flavour. 
The product was quickly withdrawn.

Given the nickname of the Black and 
Tans for their improvised uniforms, its members used uncompromising 
measures to enforce British 'Home Rule' in Ireland - and were deeply 
unpopular as a result.

In
an advert for the trainer, officially called the Nike SB Dunk Low, but 
dubbed the 'Black and Tan' for its colourings, it is stated: 'Tis the 
season for Irish beer and why not celebrate with Nike.

'The
Black and Tan sneaker takes inspiration for the fine balancing act of a
Stout (Guinness) on top a Pale Ale (Harp) in a pint glass.'

And online shoe store kicksonfire said: 
'Beer drinkers can rejoice soon as their favourite pastime is slated to 
have an official piece of footwear endorsed by Nike SB.

'The
Nike SB Dunk Low ‘Black & Tan’ is set to hit shelves in roughly 10 
days and if the last photo set we showed you wasn’t enough these should 
definitely hit the spot.

'The leather trimmed sneakers feature a 
gradient suede portion that goes from black to tan and is highlighted by
a creamy swoosh.

'The insoles also give a shout to the 
stout by featuring an image of a pint glass. These may ultimately be 
pretty hard to find as they are a quick strike release but don’t let 
them pass without a fight.'

Outrage: The new shoe has, critics say, evoked memories of the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force (right) who became notorious for a brutal crackdown on ordinary Irish men and women during the War of Independence

Crackdown: British police, known as Black and Tans for their mix-and-match military outfits of dark wool and khaki, hold a suspected Sinn Fein member at gunpoint and search him for weapons

Nike, however, said the name was not 
its 
officially given one, but had been given it by 'some' - even though it 
appears on many retailer websites as Nike SB Dunk Low 'Black and Tan'.

A spokeswoman said: 'It 
is not the official name of the shoe. It has been unofficially named by 
some using the phrase and we recognise it can be viewed as inappropriate
and insensitive.

'We apologise and no offence was intended.'

The Nike SB Dunk High Guinness, which it was launched alongside, has a higher ankle support and is black, white and brown.

Athough only deployed from 1920 to 1922, nationalist Ireland still associates the Black and Tans with murder, brutality, massacre and indiscipline in the years leading to southern Ireland's independence.

Historians say there is no dispute that 
'the Tans' killed and destroyed on a large scale, and recorded that when
a Tan was killed in Cork, they burnt down more than 300 buildings.

The Catholic cardinal of the day called them 'a horde of savages, some of them simply brigands, burglars and thieves'.

They
were created after the First World War by Winston Churchill, faced with
a increasing tide of violence from the IRA which had launched a 
campaign to drive Britain out of Ireland.

Lt
Col Smyth, one of their leading commanders, is often quoted to sum up 
the orders they were given and the reason behind their behaviour.

Merry: St Patrick's Day is celebrated by the Irish all over the world, especially in New York where there are parades and various other events

He said, in June 1920: 'If a police barracks is burned or if the barracks already occupied is not suitable, then the best house in the locality is to be commandeered, the occupants thrown into the gutter. Let them die there - the more the merrier.

'Should the order (Hands Up) not be immediately obeyed, shoot and shoot with effect. If the persons approaching (a patrol) carry their hands in their pockets, or are in any way suspicious-looking, shoot them down.

'You may make mistakes occasionally and innocent persons may be shot, but that cannot be helped, and you are bound to get the right parties some time.

'The more you shoot, the better I will like you, and I assure you no policeman will get into trouble for shooting any man.'
