He was less than chiselled as Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey. But four hours a day of workouts  and a virtually vegan diet transformed Dan Stevens into the trim hunk seen in his new film The Guest.

‘It was hard work and I had to change my metabolism,’ says Dan, 31.

He tackled gym circuits  and weights in the morning and martial arts in the afternoon, with a trip to the gun range at lunchtime.

‘The martial arts is very interesting. It’s about discipline and a focus which enables a certain change to take place,’ he says.

‘I’m more aware of what I’m putting into my body. I worked with a nutritionist who’d worked with other actors for this sort of physical preparation.

'It’s about an awareness of what you’re eating rather than having a particular diet. We all metabolise things differently and respond to different forms of exercise.’

Careful with the pressure: Alex may need to calm the campaign following new research

In the last days of campaigning ahead of this Thursday’s Scottish referendum vote, Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling should take heed of a new study that has revealed stressing out voters can directly affect turnout.

Scientists found that people with high levels of the stress hormone cortisol are less inclined to put a cross in the box.

The study, published in Physiology  And Behavior, found that cortisol played a role in people’s willingness to vote.

Researchers at the University of Nebraska collected saliva samples from  105 volunteers who were either highly conservative or highly liberal.

Saliva was collected before and after an afternoon of activities designed to both increase and lower stress.

Levels of cortisol were measured, as well as voting behaviour in six elections. The researchers believe political participation is highly stressful and therefore those with a lower cortisol level would be more likely to vote.

Fish and chips are getting healthier.  In March, LoSalt offered interested  fish-and-chip shops 3kg of their low-sodium salt as well as shakers with fewer holes so that less salt is dispensed.

This means customers eat 66 per cent less sodium. A bag of chips may contain 3.9g of salt, almost two-thirds of the recommended daily intake.

So far, 400 fish-and-chip shops nationwide have signed up to the initiative. But as there are 10,000 chippies in the UK, this is still a drop in the ocean. See losalt.com/uk/golo for your nearest participating chip shop.

The healing powers of electromagnetic therapy have been given added credence by a new trial into the effects of the home-use product ActiPatch – which delivers low-level,  safe electromagnetic pulses to provide pain relief.

The placebo-based double-blind study  looked at 154 patients with knee pain. Significant improvements were shown in three important measures associated with osteoarthritis: pain, ease of movement and quality of life. Seventy-eight per cent experienced benefits, and pain reduction was over 50 per cent.

How does it work? Blood flow in the body is regulated by electric signals that travel along nerves. Electromagnetic therapy modifies the nerve signals, providing pain relief by enhancing blood flow, thus reducing inflammation and stimulating healing.
