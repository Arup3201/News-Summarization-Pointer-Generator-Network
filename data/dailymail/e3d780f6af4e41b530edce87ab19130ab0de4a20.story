Syrian President Bashar Assad has vowed to 'live and die' in the war-torn country - despite David Cameron suggesting he could be allowed a safe passage out.

Assad struck a defiant tone in an interview with Russia Today TV, saying he will never flee his country despite the bloody 19-month-old uprising against him.

It comes just two days after Cameron suggested that Assad could be allowed safe passage out of the country if that would guarantee an end to the nation's civil war, which activists estimate has killed more than 36,000 people.

Assad, 47, said: 'I am not a puppet, I was not made by the West for me to go to the West or any other country.'

He spoke in English and excerpts of the interview were posted on the TV station's website today, with an Arabic voiceover.

Assad also warned against foreign military intervention.

'I don't think the West is headed in this direction, but if it does, nobody can predict the consequences,' he told the station.

In the excerpts, the Syrian president is seen casually talking and later walking with RT's reporter outside a house, wearing a grey suit and tie. It was not clear where the interview took place.

The uprising against Assad's regime began as mostly peaceful protests in March last year but quickly morphed into a civil war. The fighting has taken on grim sectarian tones, with the predominantly Sunni rebels fighting government forces.

Assad's regime is dominated by Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.

Yesterday, Britain called on the U.S. to do more to shape the Syrian 
opposition into a coherent force, saying the re-election of President 
Barack Obama is an opportunity for the world to take stronger action to 
end the deadlocked civil war.

Cameron said he and newly re-elected President Barack Obama 
will consider military options to remove dictator Bashar al Assad.

Mr Cameron said he and Mr Obama would make hastening the end of the 
Assad regime a priority as he was greeted by cheering young girls at the
Za'atari refugee camp, which holds 20,000 of the 200,000 refugees who 
have fled Syria for Jordan.

Earlier he visited the border area where 500 refugees are crossing every
day as the death toll from the civil war climbs towards 40,000.

Mr Cameron said: 'One of the first things I want to talk to Barack about is how we must do more to try and solve this crisis.'

Cabinet Office officials have been told to examine how Britain could get
around a European Union arms embargo on Syria to funnel weapons 
directly to opposition fighters.

No-fly zones imposed by RAF jets and direct Western air strikes have not
been 'ruled out'. Those options will be discussed when Mr Cameron 
chairs a meeting of the National Security Council on Syria next week.

Diplomatic talks are also planned between the UK’s special envoy to the 
Syrian opposition John Wilkes and rebel military chiefs in an effort to 
‘help shape the opposition’, Mr Cameron said.

Mr Cameron, who is now closing a three-day Middle East tour, said: ‘I 
wanted to hear for myself the stories of people who have been bombed and
shot and blasted out of their homes in Syria.’

The 46-year-old criticised the ‘deeply-illegitimate and unpleasant 
regime that is raining down death and destruction on its own people’ and
said it was ‘truly horrendous to hear those stories’.

Mr Cameron added: ‘It just redoubles my determination that now, with a 
newly-elected American president, we have got to do more to help this 
part of the world, to help Syria achieve transition.’

Russia
has remained one of Syria's most loyal and powerful allies, shielding 
Damascus from strong international action at the U.N. Security Council.

Russian
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in remarks posted on his ministry's
website Thursday that Moscow would not support any resolution that 
would threaten the Syrian regime with sanctions.

He criticised the West for supporting the opposition, saying foreign powers should try to force both sides to stop fighting.

'If
their priority is, figuratively speaking, Assad's head, the supporters 
of such approach must realize that the price for that will be lives of 
the Syrians, not their own lives,' Lavrov said. 'Bashar Assad isn't 
going anywhere and will never leave, no matter what they say. He can't 
be persuaded to take that step.'

The Red Cross also said today that the civil war in Syria has been in a 
downward spiral since summer which makes it impossible for the charity to cope with some of the country's humanitarian needs.

Peter Maurer, the head of the 
Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross, said that despite
his organization's improved scope of operations in the country, 'we 
can't cope with the worsening of the situation.'

'The seriousness of the crisis is deepening with every day and this trend has been uninterrupted since summer,' Maurer said. 

Since summer the Red Cross has 
improved its transportation and logistics, making it easier to bring in 
truckloads of food and medicine, but it has become overwhelmed by the 
dire need of hundreds of thousands of people struggling inside the 
country, he said.

The full interview with Assad will be broadcast on Friday, the TV station said.
