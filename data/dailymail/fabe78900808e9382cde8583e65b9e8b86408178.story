When comedian Jay Leno invited Cpt Ethan LeBerge for a ride in a shiny red muscle car, the soldier had no idea that he would walk away from the experience as the proud owner of a 2015 Dodge Hellcat.

LeBerge, who has been severely wounded in Afghanistan, became the subject of Today Show's 'Shine a Light' segment featuring Mr Leno, which aired Wednesday.

Also on Wednesday, the 64-year-old entertainer announced his decision to cancel his attendance at an upcoming gun trade show in response to a petition by the Newton Action Alliance.

Special surprise: Comedian Jay Leno (left) surprised Cpl Ethan LeBerge (right) by gifting him a brand-new muscle car worth at least $60,000

Humble hero: Cpl LeBerge was seriously wounded in a suicide bombing while serving in Afghanistan 

Attention-grabbing car: Leno visited Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where LeBerge is stationed, and offered the unsuspecting soldier to go for a spin in this shiny red 2015 Dodge Hellcat

On the road: Leno, a passionate car collector, even let LeBerge get behind the wheel 

The former Tonight Show host, who in October traveled to Afghanistan to entertain troops as part of a Today Show USO tour, said that they conducted a lottery at the time to select one service member to be awarded a special prize.

Unbeknownst to him, Cpl LeBerge ended up being that lucky soldier.

LeBerge had been on a foot patrol with his unit in Afghanistan when a suicide bomber drove up to them and set off an explosion that killed two soldiers and injured Ethan.

LeBerge came away from the blast riddled with shrapnel and suffering from numerous broken bones and a traumatic brain injury. After undergoing 10 surgeries, the soldier is still wearing an air cast on his right arm and is in near-constant pain.

‘If you called Cpl. Leberge a hero, he'd laugh,’ Sgt Clinton Lien said. ‘He'd never consider himself a hero but he is to guys like us.’

Mr Leno has recently met up with Ethan LeBerge and his comrades, many of them barely out of their teens, on the base in Fort Campbell, Kentucky,

At the end of the ride, Leno stunned LeBerge by handing him the keys to the Dodge with the words, 'it's your' 

Hugging it out: The two embraced, and Leno warned LeBerge not to get any tickets driving the 700-horsepower machine 

In an effort to surprise LeBerge, Leno invited him to check out some old muscle cars, before introducing his new friend to a fire engine-red 2015 Dodge SRT Hellcat, which comes with a price tag of $59,995 for the most basic model.

Mr Leno then offered an unsuspecting LeBerge to go for a spin with him in the 700-horsepower vehicle.

With Leno in the driver's seat, the Dodge Hellcat took to the open road, zooming past a sheriff's patrol car and an Amish horse and buggy.

The veteran comic later let an overjoyed LeBerge get behind the wheel.

Upon their return to the base, LeBerge jokingly lamented that it would be tough for him to go back to driving his old Chevy Tahoe after experiencing the Hellcat.

'I wouldn't mind having one of these,' he told Leno with a grin.

Entertainer: The idea to select a wounded soldier to receive a special prize came to Leno back in October when he traveled to Afghanistan as part of an USO tour 

Comic relief: Leno, 64, is pictured on stage entertaining troops overseas 

'It’s yours,' replied the veteran of late-night TV, handing a stunned LeBerge the keys to the brand-new Dodge.

Leno then embraced the humble infantryman, thanking him for his service.

'America loves you,' he said, 'Have a lot of fun. Don't get any tickets.'

In January, Jay Leno will auction off one of his 130 cars in Scottsdale, Arizona, and donate the proceeds to the USO.

The same day the heart-warming segment about Ethan LeBerge was aired on NBC, it was announced that Jay Leno has decided to pull out from the annual Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show, sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) - the trade association for the gun industry.

Obsessed: The former Tonight Show host has a massive collection of 130 cars from different eras 

Good deed: Leno will auction off one of his cars in January, with the proceeds going to the USO 

No show: Leno, 64, has canceled his upcoming appearance at a gun trade show in response to a petition submitted by anti-gun violence groups  

According to a press release from the Newtown Action Alliance, Leno’s cancelation comes just hours after three gun violence prevention groups had launched a petition asking him not to attend the event. 

Leno called Po Murray, the chairman of the NAA, saying that he was unaware that the NSSF was a pro-gun lobbying group based in Newtown, Connecticut - the site of the 2012 school massacre.

‘We are sincerely grateful to Mr. Leno for making this decision so quickly after it was brought to his attention,’ said Josh Horwitz, the executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ‘It shows that he cares about all the Americans whose lives have
