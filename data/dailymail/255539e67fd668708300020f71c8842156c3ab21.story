A Goldman Sachs executive has secured a luxurious full-floor Manhattan apartment with sprawling views of Central Park.

J. Michael Evans, who serves as the company’s vice chairman and global head of growth markets, recently purchased the property, which is located on the Upper East Side, steps away from the world-famous Central Park.

But all that luxury does not come cheap – for the seven-bedroom, nine-and-a-half bath property, he paid a staggering $27million.

Fine dining: Goldman Sachs vice chairman J. Michael Evans has bought an apartment at the former Stanhope Hotel for $27m; the formal dining room overlooks Central Park

Massive: The living room is 43 feet across and also has stunning park views

City views: The apartment affords views of not only the park, but other landmarks, including the George Washington Bridge and the Metropolitan Museum of Art

Sprawling: Another angle of the living room, which has incredible light

The elegant apartment, which he will share with his wife and Olympic gold medallist Lise Evans, is a full floor across, with North, South, East, and West exposures.

The New York Post’s Page Six exclusively reported the sale.

At more than 8,300 square feet, Evans has plenty of space to spread out and entertain. One can see many of New York’s landmarks from the comfort of home, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the George Washington Bridge, and of course, Central Park. 

Despite working long hours, he will always have a doorman to greet him, as the building has both a 24-hour doorman and a 16-hour concierge service.

Sweet dreams: One of the bedrooms offers a sweeping view of the New York City skyline

Keeping it casual: There is also a more low-key dining area, complete with window seating and built-in cabinetry

Famous facade: Designed by architect Rosario Candela, the building opened in 1927 as the Stanhope Hotel

Rooms with a view: The apartment is a full floor, and has a study, library, media room, and dressing rooms

Included in the expansive space are a living room 42-ft across, as well as a corner dining room and a large library overlooking Central Park.

The kitchen is full of top-of-the-line appliances, included a wine cooler, warming drawer, and built-in coffee maker.

Sources told Page Six that Evans declined buying an apartment in 15 Central Park West, where Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein lives.

Designed by architect Rosario Candela, the building opened in 1927 as the Stanhope Hotel.

Home sweet home: J. Michael Evans, right, and his wife Lise Evans, are the proud owners of the impressive residence; his wife is an Olympic gold medalist

Grand entrance: The airy entryway features plenty of wall space for priceless works of art

Cosy up: The apartment also comes with a working fireplace, though the bottle of wine is most likely just home filler

Work and play: The formal study also offers window seating

Reading room: The library also has a working fireplace

The building has enjoyed its fair share of New York history. In 1955, legendary jazz musician Charlie Parker passed away in one of the suites, and socialite Kiki Preston committed suicide there in 1946, after jumping out of a window of her fifth floor apartment.

Evans was promoted to his current position in 2011, and has worked for the company since 1993.

He has been a mainstay at charity events and auctions in recent months.

According to Bloomberg, he won a bid for celebrity chef Eric Ripert to cook a lavish dinner in his home last April.

It set him back $22,000.

High end: The kitchen features high-end appliances, warming oven, and plenty of dining space

So fresh and clean: One of the property's nine bathrooms, complete with marble counter top and shower
