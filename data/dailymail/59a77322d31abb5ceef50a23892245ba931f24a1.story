Even now, 10 years after going into remission from chronic myeloid leukaemia, Geoff Thomas has an issue with his eyes that can make Alpine descents on his bicycle rather perilous.

But a decade on from completing the entire Tour de France route to raise money for other blood cancer sufferers, Thomas is returning to the scene of what, for all the success he enjoyed as an England footballer, was his greatest triumph.

To ride day after day through the mountains so soon after recovering from a life-threatening disease was heroic. To navigate those descents at speeds up to 50mph, when all he could make out through eyes no longer capable of generating tears was the light reflecting off a car in front, bordered on the insane. ‘I was a bit deranged then,’ he admits now.

He was also a man with a mission, and after raising millions in the fight against blood cancer – and playing a significant part in persuading pharmaceutical companies to release more than £100million worth of drugs to aid clinical trials – he is inviting 20 people to join him ride the 2015 Tour route one day ahead of the professional peloton.

Thomas has a target of raising at least £2m over the next two years for the Cure Leukaemia charity that was co-founded by the doctor who saved his life, Professor Charlie Craddock.

He will attempt to do so by staging two events next summer. In June, a London to Paris bike ride that will be open to 300 cyclists who want to enjoy the thrill of riding like a professional with rolling road blocks and mechanical support. Not to mention the chance to ride in peloton-style groups of up to 75 riders to suit every ability.

Already Thomas’s former Crystal Palace team-mates Ian Wright and Mark Bright have committed to riding. Who’s the better cyclist out of the two? ‘Wrighty will think he is,’ says Thomas. ‘But Brighty, and you can quote me on this, has lost a little bit of weight.’

For the more ambitious then comes the ultimate physical challenge and the nearest anyone can get to experiencing what it must be like for Chris Froome and his rivals for three weeks in France in July. 

If anyone out there thinks they have the legs and can raise £50,000 for the cause, they could be one of the chosen 20 who gets a real taste of life on the road in a professional team environment.

‘We will be one day ahead of the Tour with rolling road blocks all the way to Paris,’ says Thomas, now 50. ‘Jaguar Land Rover are already on board and we are talking to a number of other sponsors.

‘This is about saving lives and supporting Charlie and his team, who are at the forefront of the research into blood cancers. When I was diagnosed only six per cent of blood cancer patients were getting clinical trials and nearly 60 per cent of people were dying. I was given three months to live.

‘I’m hoping that my efforts will inspire the public to get behind us and donate to Cure Leukaemia and help us save more lives.’
