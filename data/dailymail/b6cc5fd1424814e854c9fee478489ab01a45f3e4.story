Bojan Krkic is a 'great prospect' who can excite the Premier League this season, according to his Stoke City team-mate Steve Sidwell.

The 23-year-old, widely regarded just a few years ago as one of the most exciting prospects in European football, signed for Stoke this summer from Barcelona in a £1million deal.

Midfielder Sidwell also moved to the Potters after his contract expired at Fulham and he has been extremely impressed with Bojan, who has netted three goals in three pre-season matches.

Sidwell told Talksport: 'Bojan has looked very impressive and very sharp during pre-season, and he’s scored some goals as well.

'But it’s what you expect when you look at the teams he has played for, especially his education at Barcelona.

'He’s a great prospect for us, he’s an exciting player and I’m looking forward to seeing him in action when the season begins.'

Bojan's career has stalled somewhat since he first burst on to the scene at Barcelona in 2007.

He moved to Roma in 2011 but struggled for form and was loaned to AC Milan before returning to the Catalan giants.

The one-cap Spain striker then spent last season on loan at Ajax where he scored just five times in 32 appearances.
