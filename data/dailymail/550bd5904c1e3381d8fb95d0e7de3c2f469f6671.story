IF you want to know what to paint your house or how to dress next year, a leading colour forecaster has the answer: radiant orchid.

Pantone said that in 2014 the dominant hue will be the shade of purple because it can ‘intrigue the eye and spark the imagination’.

The company said that it drew you in with its ‘beguiling charm’ and that when worn by either men or women it was a ‘dazzling attention-getter’.

Colour of the year: The purple-pink 'Raidant Orchid' is the one to go for to stay on trend in 2014, says Pantone

Radiant orchid has already been seen on the catwalks for the Spring 2014 shows and is expected to feature heavily in more collections next year.

And since Pantone’s prediction is watched by everyone from designers to furniture makers, the chances are that you will be seeing a lot more of it in the months to come.

Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Colour Institute, said: ‘Radiant orchid encourages expanded creativity and originality, which is increasingly valued in today’s society.

‘An enchanting harmony of fuchsia, purple and pink undertones, radiant orchid inspires confidence and emanates great joy, love and health.’

Pantone also praised radiant orchid for being versatile and said that it looks ‘seductive’ when paired with reds or purple and pink.

In 2012, orange hue 'Tangerine Tango' was the one to paint with, according to the US colour company

In home furnishings, the colour is ‘bold without being overpowering’ and combines well with deep greens, though it matches especially well with turquoise, teal and light yellows.

Pantone, which is based in the US and describes itself as the ‘global colour authority’, scours films, art, technology and other influences to make its selection.

Last year the company said the colour of the year was emerald because it was ‘lively, radiant and lush’ - with no link at all to jealousy.

Emerald also promotes balance and harmony and enhances our sense of well-being with its ‘elegance and beauty’.

The award in 2012 went to ‘Tangerine Tango’, a bright shade of orange, which was chosen because it was ‘a bit exotic, but in a non-threatening way.’
