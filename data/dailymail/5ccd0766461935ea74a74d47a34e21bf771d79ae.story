It is the perfect reward after coming back from a well-deserved holiday: your desk covered in Post-it notes, submerged in balloons or encased in jelly.

Though they could prove a nightmare for more irritable employees, these images show the ingenuity of the mischievous colleagues who left a surprise for their beloved co-workers.

One set of pranksters appear to have forced an entire keyboard through the desk, while another constructed a festive Santa's grotto as a sign of Christmas-time goodwill. The nervous employee who had a headstone surreptitiously installed in their office will also have to hope it isn't a macabre hint from their HR department.

It comes a soon after an office prank took a particularly unfortunate turn, when 'Wolf of Shenfield' broker Robin Clark, 44, was crept up on by colleagues at brokers RP Martin. The workers shouted 'bang!' behind, a reference to a horrific incident last month when he was shot in the leg by masked assailants. The shock caused him to fall over and re-open the wound in his leg.
