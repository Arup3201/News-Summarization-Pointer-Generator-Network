Dr Martin Weale said employees could be set for pay rises

Workers can look forward to bigger pay rises in the coming year as the squeeze on family finances eases, according to a top economist at the Bank of England.

Dr Martin Weale said British companies are becoming more confident as the economy recovers – and this should lead to increased wages for millions of employees.

Households are also benefiting from the lower oil price which has slashed the price of petrol and diesel and left families with more to spend this Christmas, he said. 

The comments came as the CBI said the UK’s jobs-rich recovery will strengthen next year with more than half of firms planning to increase pay by more than inflation.

Dr Weale told the BBC: ‘When I go and visit businesses throughout the country, I find they are talking of pay increases in a way quite different from what I was hearing say even early in the year, certainly this time last year.

‘I’m getting a more general sense now that people are talking of pay increases which are materially higher than they’d offered in the past. Whereas a year ago I would come across quite a few firms saying they were going to have a pay-freeze, now I am coming across that much more rarely.’

He said the fall in the price of oil – from $115 a barrel in June to around $60 now – is ‘good news’ for the UK economy.

‘Everyone who is buying petrol is glad to see oil prices going down,’ said Dr Weale, who sits on the monetary policy committee, the panel at the Bank that sets interest rates. ‘It gives more spending power to people and that is good news at Christmas.’

Official figures last week showed average pay is now rising comfortably faster than the price of goods as the squeeze on family finances eases.

The consumer prices index measure of inflation has fallen to a 12-year low of one per cent while wages are 1.6 per cent higher than they were a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The CBI said 55 per cent of firms in the UK are planning to increase staff salaries in 2015 in line with or above the retail prices measure of inflation, which currently stands at 2 per cent.

Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at the CBI, said: ‘The economy is plotting a solid course as we head into Christmas. Whilst growth has slowed somewhat, this reflects a return to a steadier, more sustainable pace as the recent boost from pent-up demand fades.

A drop in the price of oil has meant more employees will have more money to spend around Christmas, experts added, as British companies look geared up to increase wages (file image)

‘But the global backdrop remains a concern for firms. The weak Eurozone, slowing emerging markets and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine are headwinds to growth.

‘While lower oil and fuel prices will leave more money in the pockets of households and businesses, it is also making life difficult for major oil producers.’

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said workers are still feeling the squeeze.

‘After seven years of falling wages and few decent pay rises on offer, Britain’s workers are set to wait years for their living standards to get back to where they were before the financial crisis,’ she said.

‘We need stronger growth and better labour market regulation, to ensure that the rewards of the recovery are fairly shared and to avoid getting stuck with a low value, cut-price economy.’
