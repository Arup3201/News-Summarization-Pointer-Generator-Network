Ever wondered what your cat gets up to while you are on holiday? 

A cattery has installed cameras so you can keep an eye on them while you are away. 

Owners will be able to watch their pets 24-hours a day through wireless web 'cat-cams' that even work in the dark.

A cat's eye view: Carly Ogden and Jane Dewhurst with two felines who are being kept under the watchful eyes of cat cams at the cattery

The cameras have been fitted at the sanctuary by Carly Ogden and Jane Dewhurst from Higher Spen Cattery in the village of Fence, in Lancashire.  

Clients are issued with a password which they can use to catch a glimpse of their feline friend.

Only the pet owner can view the cat instead of the footage being live streamed on the web for all to see. 

Ms Ogden, from Padiham, near Burnley, Lancshire said: 'I just wanted to do something a little bit different and this seemed like a great idea.

The cat-cams are proving to be the purfect gadget for pet lovers who want to keep an eye on their feline friends

'I'm not technically minded whatsoever and people thought I was mad, but the guys, who run our website, said it was a brilliant idea and told me that I'd be able to set it all myself.

'I can't believe I actually did.'

The web cams are so popular people have been travelling miles to leave their cat under the watchful eyes at the cattery.

Daryelle Sunderland, who left three family pets at the cattery, said: 'Blue, Tig and Smudge were comfortable and happy throughout our holiday and we knew that, because the web-cam proved it.

'It just made our holiday more relaxing and gave us peace of mind, day or night.'

Ms Dewhurst said: 'Cats are people's prized possessions and are an important part of family life. 

'We have a lady who breeds very expensive cats and she told us she would never leave them anywhere where she couldn't see them.

'The web cams are also really popular with families with children, as they love their pets so much and are upset when they have to leave them behind on holiday. 

'This gives them the chance to be able to check up on them and make sure they're alright.'

In June this year the BBC aired a documentary which followed the secret lives of cats.

The programme documented how for one week in April, 50 cats in the picturesque Surrey village of Shamley Green were put under 24-hour surveillance, fitted with cat-cams which recorded their every move.
