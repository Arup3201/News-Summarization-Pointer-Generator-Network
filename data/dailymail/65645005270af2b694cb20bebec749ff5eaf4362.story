It is the moment many young children dream about - waking up on Christmas morning to find a bulging stocking full of treats hanging on their bedpost.

But this year some youngsters may find one traditional bag of goodies missing, as Cadbury has announced they will no longer be making their beloved sacks of chocolate coins.

The company dropped the bombshell on Twitter today, replying to a consumer enquiry with: 'Chocolate coins have been discontinued however we have lots of other chocolatey treats to try'.

No more: The confectionery giant will not be selling their sacks of chocolate coins this Christmas

The comment was met with shock with many on the social media site questioning the decision to abandon the Christmas favourite.

One user, Mark Cobley, posted the dramatic message: 'NOOOOOOOOOOOO This is a horrendous decision and @CadburyUK must reconsider.'

Another, Melanie Bien, worte: 'How do I explain that to the 5yo and 3yo who adore them? #wrongmove.'

An online petition has also been launched to reverse the confectionery companys move to stop selling the 59 gram sacks. 

Treats: Chocolate coins have become a traditional Christmas stocking item

Chocolate coins have long been a Christmas treat and the tradition is thought to have stemmed from Saint Nicholas secretly giving his money away to children in his native Turkey.

The figure, a 4th centruy bishop we now call Santa Claus, was shy so he decided to drop his purse  down a chimney. 

It landed in a pair of stockings a little girl had hung up to dry and the tradition was born.

Cadbury, established in Birmingham in 1824, was bought by US company Kraft Foods for £11.5 billion in 2010.

The acquisition faced widespread disapproval from the UK public - dismayed at the prospect of an iconic British institution falling into American hands.

Last year Kraft split into two companies, with the confectionery business taking the name of Mondelēz International, of which Cadbury is now a subsidiary.

Explaining their decision, a spokesman told The Telegraph that wrapping foil around the coin-shaped chocolates was 'fiddly' work. 

They suggested the coins were not as profitable as other products because they could not market them in the 'Cadbury purple'. 

The chocolate maker also believes shoppers have switched to cheaper, own-brand versions sold at supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl causing its own sales to decline.

'We are sorry to see the coins go, but that's business,' the spokesman added.
