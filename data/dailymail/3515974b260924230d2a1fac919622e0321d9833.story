Taken before and after Superstorm Sandy brought colossal devastation to America's Atlantic coast, these NASA satellite images show the massive impact hurricane-strength winds and storm surges had on the electricity infrastructure of New York and New Jersey.

What were clear clusters of twinkling lights just a few days earlier were turned to great swathes of darkness by the ferocity of the storm as power lines and substations offered little resistance to the extreme elements.

The photograph of the mid-Atlantic region was taken in the early hours of November 1, two days after Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City in New Jersey.

The same area had been photographed by 
the Suomi NPP satellite on October 21 and clearly shows a much brighter 
New York City (right), Philadelphia (centre) and Washington DC (left).

Before and after: These NASA satellite images show (left) the Atlantic 
coast on October 21 before the storm and (right) on November 1, after 
Sandy struck

While the centre of the cities remain illuminated, suburbs and more outlying areas have been plunged into darkness.

Interstate routes 444 and 18 which extend towards the New Jersey shoreline appear darker in the second image.

In total, eight million people were left without electricity from Maine down to South Carolina, and as far inland as Ohio.

It
 took several days to restore power to the New York area, with at least 
643,000 New Yorkers clearing up from the storm in the dark.

The
 lower half of Manhattan blacked out after an electrical substation 
close to the East River blew up after being overwhelmed by flood waters.
 Engineers had to wait for flood waters to recede before they could 
assess damage to electrical infrastructure, most of which is 
underground.

Above ground wiring knocked out by high winds and falling trees in other districts was repaired in less time.

Power
 firm ConEdison said 100,000 primary electrical wires were knocked down 
in the city and nearby Westchester County to the north, affecting about 
810,000 people in total.

In Ohio, high winds knocked out power to more than 250,000 homes and in Pennsylvania, 1.2m went without power.

Freak snow storms affected supply in Maryland and West Virginia.

NASA
 launched the Suomi NPP satellite on October 28, 2011 from Vandenburg 
Air Force Base in California. In its first year, the satellite has 
orbited the Earth more than 5,000 times and is returning thousands of 
images which are being used to predict weather and climate patterns.
