It was love at first sight for a couple who are so enamoured by the English Riviera that they have been on holiday there 170 times over the last 45 years.

Alan and June Lazenby first visited the Devon coast in 1969 when they were courting and have since returned for multiple holidays and various landmark occasions including their honeymoon and to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary.

The Lazenbys' from Woking in Surrey, make the 170 mile journey several times a year to the Torbay region and admit they are completely taken with the area. 

Time of their life: Alan and June Lazenby in July 2014 at Roundham Head  near Torquay

Same  but different: The couple at the Spanish arches in Youngs Park near Torquay in 1970

Their early holidays were rooted in Paignton, where they would stay in a static caravan. After  marrying and having children, the Lazenbys continued to visit for two weeks every year, staying at Louville Holiday Camp in Brixham and later at Waterside Holiday Park in Paignton.

In 1990 they finally decided to buy their own caravan at Waterside so they could spend even more time in the area.

Four generations of their family including June's parents, the couple's two children and now their grandsons aged 14 and ten have visited Torbay.

Things have stepped up  and during the last 11 years the pensioners have made five trips a year to Paignton, and have already booked four for next year (with another three in the initial stages of planning).

Alan said: 'We love coming down and when we get home we plan the next visit. 'The journey from Surrey by car used to take about eight hours in the early years, and now it can be done easily in under four hours.

'In all those years of talk about a Kingskerswell bypass we never thought it would ever get started, and next year it will be completed. When we turn south at Exeter it's like coming home.

Latest trip: The Lazenbys in November this year in Torquay reading the Torquay Herald Express 

'We will never give it up. It will always be fascinating for us.'

'I don't know why, it was just love at first sight for us when we first visited all those years ago.' 

Special occasion: Train journey on Paignton - Dartmouth steam railway for  25 wedding anniversary in 1997

Torbay, a borough in Devon, spreads over roughly 25 square miles of land and spans the towns of Torquay, Babbacombe, Paignton and Brixham. 

It has clean golden sandy beaches, rugged walks, beautiful towns, bright blue seas, countless seaside activities, award winning fish and chips and Torquay is the birthplace of crime writer Agatha Christie.
