Tourism leaders in Lebanon want to sue the producers of US drama 'Homeland' claiming the latest episode was full of 'lies' and wrongly depicts Beirut as harbouring terrorists.

Lebanese Tourism Minister Fadi Abboud is so upset about the show's 'damaging' portrayal of the city that he is consulting lawyers.

Abboud said the episode wrongly depicted the 
city as a strong-hold for terrorists and a place where foreigners can 
easily fall victim to random attacks.

However his comments have now been overshadowed by a car bomb which rocked the city this afternoon.

At least eight people have been killed and an estimated 80 people wounded in the worst blast seen in the city for years.

The attack reportedly occurred as parents picked their children up from school.

Reporters at the scene described seeing bloodied victims being 
loaded in ambulances and heavy damage to residential buildings.

The motive for the car-bomb is not immediately clear.

However it comes at a
 time when Lebanon has seen a rise in tension and eruptions of clashes stemming from the civil war in neighboring Syria.

In
 scenes reminiscent of the dark days of Lebanon's civil war, ambulances 
ferried the wounded to several hospitals, where doctors, nurses and 
students waited for casualties at the doors - meanwhile the hospitals 
put out an appeal for blood donations.

An employee of a bank on the street pointed to the blown-out windows of his building.

'Some people were wounded from my bank. I think it was a car bomb. The whole car jumped five floors into the air,' he said.

Michael Fish, 25, a British musician visiting Beirut, said he was in his hotel a street away when the explosion happened.

'At first I thought it was an earthquake. It shook the whole hotel for a second. I ran down and started filming on my iPhone.'

The bomb exploded in the street where the office of the anti-Assad Christian Phalange Party is located.

It was not immediately clear if the 
explosion targeted any political figure in Lebanon's divided community 
but it occurred at a time of heightened tension between Lebanese 
factions on opposite sides of the Syria conflict.

Ambulances
 rushed to the scene of the blast near Sassine Square in Ashafriyeh, a 
mostly Christian area, as smoke rose from the area.

It occurred during rush hour, when many parents were picking up children from school.

Several
 cars were destroyed by the explosion and the front of a multi-storey 
building was badly damaged, with tangled wires and metal railings 
crashing to the ground.

Residents
 ran about in panic looking for relatives while others helped carry the 
wounded to ambulances, and security forces blanketed the area.

Lebanese Tourism Minister Fadi Abboud complained about Homeland's 'damaging' portrayal of Beirut -  just before a car bomb rocked the city

The war in neighbouring Syria, which has killed 30,000 people so far, has pitted mostly Sunni insurgents against President Bashar al-Assad, who is from the Alawite sect linked to Shi'ite Islam.

Tension between Sunnis and Shi'ites has been rumbling in Lebanon ever since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war but reignited after the Syria conflict erupted.

In Damascus, Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoabie told reporters: 'We condemn this terrorist explosion and all these explosions wherever they happen. Nothing justifies them.'

Phalange leader Sami al-Gemayel, a staunch opponent of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and a member of parliament, condemned the attack.

'Let the state protect the citizens. We will not accept any procrastination in this matter, we cannot continue like that. We have been warning for a year. Enough,' said Gemayel, whose brother was assassinated in November 2006.

The attack came just as the Tourism Minister Mr Abboud went on the offensive to try to revive 
the city's reputation as the 'Paris of the Middle East'

He insisted the city
 was more secure than London or New York and feared foreigners would be put off.

Mr Abboud is particularly upset about the second episode of the Homeland, which he says shows the city to be a 'non secure zone'.

He said: 'This kind of film damages the image of Lebanon – it is not fair to us 
and it’s not true, it is not portraying reality.'

'We want to take action, we want to write to the filmmakers and 
producers and demand an apology.

'And we are planning to raise a lawsuit 
against the director and the producer', he told Executive magazine.

The award-winning show, based on the Israeli series 'Prisoners of War,' is about a 
U.S Marine named Nick Brody who was a POW for years in the Middle East. 

The federal government and the public 
see Brody as a war hero, but a CIA operative played by Claire Danes 
believes he was turned by the enemy and is now a threat to the U.S.

In the episode 'Beirut is Back', which aired on Channel 4 last Sunday, Danes is aiming to take out a 
senior figure affiliated with Lebanon’s Shiite Hezbollah organisation.

The organisation is portrayed as a movement allied with Al-Qaeda in the series.

The scene is supposed to be set in Hamra Street, West Beirut but Mr Abboud said the street is not violent and dirty but a lively, safe,
 neighbourhood packed with cafes, book shops and pubs.

During the 1960s Beirut attracted international superstars who would party in the city's seafront hotels.

However this era was short-lived and ended when the civil war began in 1975. The city was ruled by militias and the city became divided between Christian and Muslims. It soon became known for its hostage-takings, suicide bombings and massacres.

The Lebanon hostage crisis saw the kidnapping in Lebanon of 96 foreign hostages – mostly American and western European – between 1982 and 1992.

Among the Britons taken was John McCarthy, who was set free in 1991 after more than five years in captivity, and Terry Waite, who spent four years in solitary confinement.

Fighting continued to ravage the city, as did shelling from Israeli fighter plans, and there were many thousands of deaths, but from 1991 the city began to rebuild itself.

It's now well on the road to being regarded as the most liberal and fun-loving major Arab cities.

However, portrayal of Lebanon as swarming with guns is not unreasonable either. The country still has dozens of armed 
militias that still flourish, and an alarming number of private 
individuals have weapons in their homes.

The biggest militia of all, 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, has gained so much power and influence over 
the years that it's now part of the government, wielding virtual veto 
power.

Twentieth Century Fox Television, which produces the Showtime drama, has refused to comment.

Mr Abboud is also concerned about the fact the Beirut scenes were actually shot in Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis 
about 150 miles south of Beirut. The two nations are technically at war.

Jaffa, a popular mixed Jewish and Arab 
neighbourhood of Tel Aviv, allowed the creators of 
'Homeland' to present a plausible version of Beirut.

Ghada Jaber, a 60-year-old housewife, said Israel should never stand in for Lebanon.

'It is very insulting. Israel destroyed our country. Israel invaded and occupied our country.'

However, Hamed Moussa, an engineering student at 
the American University of Beirut, said it was not a problem that Israelis
 are portraying Lebanese.

He said Lebanese often play Israeli 
characters in Lebanese soap operas.

Ariel Kolitz, a childhood friend of 
Gideon Raff, the Israeli co-creator of 'Homeland,' said the producers 
didn't have the option of shooting in Beirut, where Raff and other 
Israelis are not allowed to visit.

Many Lebanese cannot forget the massive 
destruction Israel inflicted on Beirut during the 1982 invasion when it 
succeeded in routing the Palestine Liberation Organization from the 
country.

They resent the 18-year occupation of south Lebanon that 
followed, and their leaders reject the existence of the 
Jewish state.

But to Israel, Lebanon has been a staging ground for missile strikes and other attacks on Israel, more than justifying the massive Israeli operations there that have occurred in every decade since the 1970s.

Eytan Schwartz, a spokesman for Tel Aviv's mayor, said the Lebanese should be pleased at the TV show's choice for a stand-in.

'If I were Lebanese, with all due respect, I'd be very flattered that a city, and a world heritage site, thanks to its incredible architecture, and residents who were named among the top 10 most beautiful people in the world (ranked by Traveler's Digest magazine in 2012) could pass as Lebanese,' he said.
