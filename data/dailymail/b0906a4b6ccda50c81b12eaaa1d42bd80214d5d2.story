Dessie Hughes, one of the best known figures in Irish racing has died at the age of 71.

Hughes, who was based at a stable near The Curragh, was one of the few people who have managed to achieve top level success as both a jockey and trainer.

In his riding days, Hughes won eight races as a jockey at the Cheltenham Festival and captured the two biggest prizes with victory on Davy Lad in the 1977 Gold Cup and Monksfield in the 1979 Champion Hurdle.

As well as being a top trainer Hughes will be remembered for his talents as a jockey, winning eight races

The best horse he ever brought to the Festival as a trainer was the redoubtable Hardy Eustace, winner of the 2003 Neptune Investment Management Novices’ Hurdle and the Champion Hurdle in both 2004 and 2005.

Hughes was also the father of jockey Richard Hughes, who recently dedicated winning his third champion jockeys’ title this year to his father.

Leading the tributes to Hughes, Conor O'Dwyer, who rode Hardy Eustace in both his Champion Hurdle triumphs, said: ‘There's gentlemen and then there was Dessie Hughes. I've ridden for many good people during my career, but Dessie really stood out as a proper gentleman.

‘We had some brilliant times together, some of the best times of my career. No one ever had a bad word to say about Dessie, and Dessie never had a bad word to say about anyone.

‘He'd had some hard times, but he'd come through and seemed to be enjoying the best of his career. It's a sad day for everyone and for racing.’

Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, tweeted: "RIP Dessie Hughes. A great trainer, great jockey and an absolute gentleman.’

Eddie O'Leary, racing manager for leading owners Gigginstown House Stud, who had horses with Hughes, said: "He was a fantastic trainer and a lovely man. He was a true gent.’

Another of Hughes's patrons was Barry Connell, who sent him the exciting novice chaser The Tullow Tank at the start of this season and also owned top hurdler Our Conor.

He said: "The first thing to say about Dessie is that he was an absolute gentleman. He was a man who was very loyal to his staff and respected them a lot.

‘He was very much an old school trainer, who was very hands on and took great pride in his horses and his staff. When he got a good horse he was able to keep him sound year after year and the horses always ran to their highest level of form.’

As well as son Richard, Hughes is survived by wife Eileen and daughter Sandra.
