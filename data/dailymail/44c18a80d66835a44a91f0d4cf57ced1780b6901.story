Authorities say a fatal shooting at a Florida church and two deaths at a home across town are connected and they are looking to question a 33-year-old man.

The Manatee County Sheriff's Office said it is trying to locate Andres 'Andy' Avalos in order to question him 'in what appears to be a triple homicide.'

Manatee County deputies went to Bayshore Baptist Church in Bradenton on 14th Street West around 1:20pm in response to a shooting, the sheriff's office said in a release. One body was found there.

Where is he? The Manatee County Sheriff's Office said it is trying to locate Andres 'Andy' Avalos, 33, in order to question him 'in what appears to be a triple homicide'

At the church, deputies 'learned of the possibility of other victim(s),' the Manatee County Sheriff's Office said. 

Two bodies were recovered after deputies went to a home on  67th Street NW. 

Deputies say Avalos was last spotted behind the wheel of a gold 2003 Chevrolet Suburban with 484VTZ plates near the church. 

Dave Bristow, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, told reporters that Avalos should be considered armed and dangerous. 

Two female victims were discovered at the home, while a male victim was discovered on church grounds, The Bradenton Herald reported. 

None of the victims were immediately named, but the church's website lists Amber Avalos as an employee.

Five local schools - Manatee High School, King Middle Schoo, Miller Elementary School and Palma Sola Elementary School - were placed on lockdown in response to the shooting, but the lockdowns were lifted at 3:45pm, WFLA reported. 

Bradenton is about 35 miles south of Tampa along Florida's Gulf coast.
