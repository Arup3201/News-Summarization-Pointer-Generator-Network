Despicable: The home owner opened his front door to what he believed was Mormon missionaries

The pair were caught on surveillance cameras wearing the typical missionary outfit of white shirt, black pants, black tie and black shoes. They were both carrying backpacks.

The two robbers did not appear to be wearing official name tags with their name and the words 'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' printed on it. 

Kristen Howey, a Mormon church spokesperson told the Las Vegas Review-Journal it was 'unfortunate' that thieves had imitated the church's missionaries. 

Suspect one is described as a white male, 22-28 years old, 5'7'-5'8' and 130-145 lbs. He was last seen wearing a white shirt, black tie, black pants and black shoes. He was carrying a black backpack and was armed with a handgun.

Suspect two is described as a black male, 22-28 years old, 5'10'-6'1', 190-210 lbs. He was last seen wearing a white shirt, black tie, black pants and black shoes.

Spreading the word: An official from the Mormon church said that genuine missionaries normally wear name tags

Mormon missionaries are volunteers from the LDS Church, normally young men and women in their early twenties or late teens.

They
volunteer at hundreds of projects across the world and are not paid for
their services, typically funding their own trip or with the help of family and friends. 

Missionaries
who proselytize door-to-door are a common sight across the U.S., 
spreading the word of the Mormon Church to non-members.
