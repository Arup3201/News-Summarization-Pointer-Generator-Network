Formula One ringmaster Bernie Ecclestone has revealed that Hockenheim will host this year's German Grand Prix.

Hockenheim was the venue for last season's  race in Germany under an agreement to alternate with the Nuerburgring, which is under new ownership. 

The 2015  calendar does not currently specify a venue for July's race, but Ecclestone has insisted that the event won't be held at Nuerburgring.

'It's going to be at Hockenheim and we're in the middle of doing something with them,' said Ecclestone, 84, on Thursday. 'It can't be Nuerburgring because there's nobody there. 

'We've got a contract in place with Hockenheim, we just have to amend the years of the contract. 

'It was alternating with Nuerburgring so we'll just take that out.'
