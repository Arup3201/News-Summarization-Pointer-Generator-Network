A male porn star brutally stabbed a 60-year-old married millionaire to death at his Florida beach house after he invited him back for a private dance, it has been alleged.

John Snavely, 26, allegedly stabbed Sam Del Brocco a dozen times in the chest following a fight about money in September 2010 - but he avoided suspicion for nearly three years and continued his hard-partying lifestyle of drugs, fast cars and sex as he rose the ranks of Florida's porn industry.

Snavely was finally arrested and charged with murder in August when his DNA, which had been taken at a drug arrest in Miami, matched DNA on a marijuana joint and Diet Coke can at the murder scene.

Now the Miami New Times has revealed sordid details surrounding the grisly killing, detailing Del Brocco's final hours and unraveling Snavely's troubled childhood and addictions to cash and drugs.

Arrest: Gay stripper and porn star John Snavely, left, allegedly stabbed millionaire marketing executive, Sam Del Brocco, right, to death in his Florida beach house in September 2010 after meeting at a gay club

Success: Snavely started with gay porn but soon rose up the ranks of straight porn. He also worked in a gay strip clubs and friends said he was addicted to the party lifestyle and drugs that the job afforded

The reporter, Michael Miller, also 
spoke to Snavely, who performed both gay and straight porn under the 
name 'Champ', in jail in Fort Lauderdale, where he protested his 
innocence.

'Everyone thinks I'm a killer just 
because my life was taboo,' he said. 'All I 
have to say is that I'm innocent.'

Broward
 County sheriffâ€™s detectives believe that Del Brocco, a marketing 
executive from Alexandria, Virginia who worked in Washington D.C., flew 
to Florida and bought cocaine and marijuana before he visited his 
favorite gay strip clubs.

He
 was introduced to Snavely at a club called Boardwalk, where Snavely 
performed as a stripper, and the pair jumped in Del Brocco's Porsche and
 went to his townhouse in Pompano Beach.

Detectives believe Del Brocco plied 
the younger man with drugs and then Snavely demanded $500 in cash 
up-front before Del Brocco demanded he dance for him, the New Times 
reported.

But then an 
argument ensued - the reporter suggested Del Brocco got too touchy or 
that Snavely cut short his performance - and Snavely stormed out.

Life in the fast lane: Snavely avoided suspicion
 for three years - enjoying drugs, cash and sex as he made up to $4,000 a
 week making porn and stripping at gay clubs. But friends said he also 
had a temper

Scene: He was stabbed to death at his beach condo after allegedly meeting Snavely at a gay club

Rather
 than just leaving the plush home, he reached the kitchen and had second
 thoughts - and pulled open a drawer and found a long butcher's knife, 
the paper reported.

He then allegedly returned to 
the bedroom and repeatedly stabbed the older man before fleeing the 
bloody scene - and leaving a trail of bloodied imprints from his Nike 
shoes.

In the kitchen, he allegedly wiped 
down the knife before throwing it under a rug and leaving. He had also 
allegedly left DNA behind on the joint and the can and fingerprints on 
Del Brocco's car.

Police
 visited the home the next day to carry out a welfare check after 
friends in Washington D.C. had been unable to get through to him on the 
phone. The investigation turned on the DNA evidence.

In
 the years before Snavely was linked to the crime, he rose up the ranks 
of the porn industry in Florida - earning as much as $4,000 a week by 
shooting multiple sex scenes and stripping.

It
 followed a troubled childhood with an absent father, criminal mother 
and his own arrests for petty crimes before a stint stripping in gay 
clubs in San Antonio, Texas - he insisted he was straight but that the 
gay clubs paid better.

Double life: Samuel Del Brocco, pictured with his partner of 30 years, Jan Shafer (right), was a businessman in Virginia. When he visited Florida, he visited gay clubs, which is where he allegedly met Snavely

Victim: Police say Snavely murdered Del Brocco, pictured, after they fought about money at his home

It was there that he was spotted in 2009 by a porn industry recruiter, who saw him as ideal for the gay market and he began scoring roles in gay porn films in 2010.

By 2011, he had switched to straight porn films using the screen name 'Champ', where he was shooting multiple scenes as well as sleeping with numerous women off set every week.

'He loved to spend money, man,' a friend told the New Times. 'Watches, shoes, clothes, name-brand shit. He 
felt like a nobody if he didn't have a BMW or some kind of ridiculous 
car.'

But while loving the high life, friends and roommates claimed he also had a short temper and his girlfriend, who was just 15 when they met on set, suffered abuse at his hands, they said. He cut her hair and once burned her face in a bid to find out whether or not she had been cheating.

'Champ was a great person, but he had a dark side,' a friend said.

Plea: Before Snavely was arrested, Del Brocco's partner Jan Shafer pleaded for information and said that she would have to accept his double life if it led to investigators solving the murder

On December 9, 2012 he was pulled over in Fort Pierce and police allegedly found marijuana, Xanax, and amphetamines in the car. He was given probation this summer and authorities swabbed his cheek before he left.

After the sample was entered into the state database, it allegedly matched DNA from the Coke can and the joint from the Del Brocco murder scene. He was arrested on July 25 and charged in August.

Snavely is charged with second-degree murder, which carries a possible penalty of 10 years to life.

Speaking to the New Times, he suggested that one of Del Brocco's employees killed him for his money, or that a rival porn star stole his semen and placed it at the scene.

But he admitted he was losing himself to his onscreen alter ego.

'It became my personality,' he said. 'I couldn't just be John from Texas anymore. I always had to be Champ, Champ, Champ.'
