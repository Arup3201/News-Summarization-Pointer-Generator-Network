In one, a man dressed in red pajamas scratches his crotch; in the other, a woman does the same.

These two anti-wool adverts are almost identical - but one has been banned from Times Square.

The PETA video campaign featuring a man scratching himself while wearing unbuttoned red, long pajamas was deemed too racy for the New York tourist attraction, the animal rights group said.

'Too racy': This PETA video campaign featuring a man scratching himself while wear unbuttoned red long underwear was deemed too racy for Times Square in New York, the radical animal rights group said

Revealing: In the video, the model is pictured reaching his hand down the sides of his pajamas - which appear to be opened low enough to show his pubic hair (pictured) - before scratching his crotch area

Anti-wool: The advert, banned by Neutron Media, uses the slogan 'Scratch Wool From Your Shopping List'

 

In the video, the model reaches his hand down the sides of his clothes - which appear to be opened low enough to show his pubic hair - before scratching.

In contrast, footage of a woman performing a similar action - but with no hair visible - was reportedly considered acceptable for display on a Times Square billboard.

The female version of the advert, featuring the slogan 'Scratch Wool From Your Shopping List' and the hastag #WoolFreeWinter, was launched on Sunday, according to the New York Post.

Situated on 42nd Street, between 7th and 8th Avenues, it aims to highlight the injuries sheep suffer during shearing in Asia, Australia and South America.

Speaking to the newspaper, PETA vice president Dan Mathews said he was confused as to why the male video had been banned by Neutron Media, which leased the billboard to the group.

'We’re living in the era of twerking, where people are simulating anal sex on TV,' Mr Mathews said. 'I don’t see how scratching is a big thing.'

But despite his criticism, he added that he and other activists were pleased to gain advertising space during such a high-demand period.

Another PETA advert is expected to debut at 1500 Broadway later this month. Above, the group's website

'In previous times, advertisers didn’t want to give space to a group that encourages people not to shop,' he said. 'It’s nice to finally have advertisers allowing our message.'
