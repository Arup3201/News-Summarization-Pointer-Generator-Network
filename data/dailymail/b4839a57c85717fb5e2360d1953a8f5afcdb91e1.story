Last month, U.K. woman Danielle Andrews welcomed the first girl into her family in a century. 

Since before World War I, Ms Andrews' family had produced only male offspring.

But she may have been one-upped. Darwin grandmother Alex Martin says her family had a 'boy drought' for 138 years.

A Martin family tree. The 'boy drought' ended in 1986, when Alex's son Luke was born. 

Before Ms Martin broke the chain in the 1980s, the last boy in her bloodline was her great, great grandfather, Henry Ellis.

He was born in 1848, running a shop in Cambrian Head, in NSW's Central West.

Queen Victoria ruled the British Empire, Melbourne had only recently been declared a city and Australia was more than a half-century away from Federation. 

After her great, great grandfather, there was a big gap. 

Henry and his wife, Annie, had three girls. One of them, Annie Thomson, was named after her mother. She would be Alex's great-grandmother. 

The tradition would continue on from there. Her grandmother, Marjorie, and her mother, Barbara Crick, were only children. And Ms Crick gave birth to Alex.

'Who said women were the weaker sex?' Ms Martin quipped.

To no one's surprise, Ms Martin's first daughter was also a girl, baby Rachael. 

But Ms Martin finally brought the family's Great Boy Drought to an end in 1986 when she welcomed her first and only son into the world.  

'When I had Luke I thought, oh, OK!' she said. 'This is a first.' 

Her grandfather was especially 'rapt', she said. 

She realised her very female heritage while reading a story about the very male bloodline of Ms Andrews in the The Northern Territory News earlier this week. 

Years after her son was born, 'the drought's well and truly broken,' Ms Martin told Daily Mail Australia. 

Ms Martin is the grandmother of three boys - Byron, 9, Bailey, 7, and Mason, 5 - and, of course, of two girls, Codie, 11, and Bella, 7. And she said she's 'very proud' of all of them.
