Many cities like to boast that they are the most innovative and cosmopolitan.

But now there's an official list which proves which are the most intelligent cities - and could leave bigger rivals seething with envy.

The Intelligent Community Forum has compiled a list of its top seven most intelligent cities after a raft of hopeful cities entered the competition - and leading the way are Canada and Taiwan who have two cities each nominated.

Stratford in Ontario has is in the running to be given the prestigious title of most intelligent community

Brainboxes: Toronto has made it to the top seven intelligent communities, the think tank announced

ICF founder Robert Bell said that more than 400 cities around the world vie for the title given by the think tank, which studies the economic and social development of the 21st century community.

A panel of academic leaders select about two dozen and inspect them until eventually the final seven are announced, NBC said.

Each community is subjected to a rigorous process - such as an inspection of how their local government works to what is taught in universities - before the smartest city is found.

They have to prove that they can help educate their citizens and encourage them to prosper.

The current list are:

The ICF said: 'Intelligent Communities are those which have – whether through crisis or foresight – come to understand the enormous challenges of the Broadband Economy, and have taken conscious steps to create an economy capable of prospering in it. 

'They are not necessarily big cities or famous technology hubs. 

Oulu city in Finland could be crowned with the title and follow in the footsteps of last year's Californian winners

Top of the class: Tallinn had to prove to the ICF that it could educate its citizens and help them prosper

'They are located in developing 
nations as well as industrialized ones, suburbs as well as cities, the 
hinterland as well as the coast.'

Last year's winner was Riverside, California which was presented with the title of Intelligent Community of the Year.

Mr Bell has so far visited Columbus' Battelle, Nationwide Children's Hospital, The Ohio State University, the OSU Super Computer, the Columbus Metropolitan Library and TechColumbus as he seeks to find the most intelligent community.

Hopeful entrants have to prove that they were innovative in encouraging businesses and offering capital to new ventures.

They had to show citizens had a strong education and access to further learning.

Pick us! Columbus in Ohio made it through to the top seven after 400 cities entered the competition

Taiwan has a greater chance of winning as it has two communities in the final seven. Taichung City is one of the finalists

Taoyuan in Taiwan impressed judges after it explained how it helped its citizens and encouraged the community to develop

Cities had to provide comprehensive 
and good broadband connectivity to households and could market their 
community as successful.

The panel looked for strong leadership
 within the area, proof that the success of the community could be 
sustained and have strong collaboration, where everyone worked together 
to improve themselves.

It finally had to proof that it was 
'digitally inclusive' by offering public computers to its citizens and 
providing digital literacy courses for residents.

The Intelligent Community Forum explained how it compiled its list by examining entrants answers and then shaving the list down until it reached its last few finalists.

It said: The Top seven represent models of economic and social transformation in the 21st Century.

'They are not the most advanced technology centers, the most wired cities or the fastest growing economies in the world.

'Instead, each exemplifies best practices in broadband deployment and use, workforce development, innovation, digital inclusion and advocacy that offer lessons to regions, cities, towns and villages around the world.  

'They are charting new paths to lasting prosperity for their citizens, businesses and institutions.'
