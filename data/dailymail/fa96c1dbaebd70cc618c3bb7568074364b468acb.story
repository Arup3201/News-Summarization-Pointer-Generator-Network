Make-or-break talks between Greek and EU finance ministers collapsed last night after just three hours – with Athens rejecting the latest bailout offer as ‘absurd’.

The current bailout runs out in two weeks, and the EU had originally said Greece would have to demand an extension to the loan by yesterday.

But, following the collapse of the meeting in Brussels, European officials gave the newly elected radical Left government in Athens another three days, with the possibility of another meeting on Friday.

If no deal is reached, Greece will be unable to service its debt and could run out of cash, meaning it would not be able to pay its civil servants or fund pensions.

Economists have warned that this could see the country being forced out of the euro, which would spark a crisis in the eurozone and have damaging knock-on effects for the UK economy.

The pound rose to a seven-year high against the euro last night as the single currency was hammered on the foreign exchange markets. Sterling rose above 1.355 euros, a level not seen since January 2008.

The pound has risen by nearly 20 per cent against the euro since July 2013 – giving British holidaymakers more money to spend on the Continent.

German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said that Greece is living beyond its means 

Greece’s Left-wing Syriza government wants the country’s bailout to be restructured, with an end to many austerity demands.

The International Monetary Fund and European Union say there should be no change to the terms of the current £178billion loan.

Yesterday evening, a Greek official said the talks had come to an end without a deal being reached.

‘Some people’s insistence on the Greek government implementing the bailout is unreasonable and cannot be accepted,’ the official said. ‘Those who keep returning to this issue are wasting their time. Under such circumstances, there cannot be a deal today.’

Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup, which represents eurozone finance ministers, said there was still time for a deal.

‘There is time to agree on the terms of an extension,’ he said. ‘When I listen to my Greek colleagues talking about a bridging loan and so on – that’s a different word for an extension.’

The current bailout expires on February 28. Any new agreement would have to be approved by national governments, so time is running out to reach a compromise without which Greece is likely to run out of money.

Leaving the meeting, European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis said it was now up to Athens to request an extension – something the new Greek government has said it will not do.

Before the meeting, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said: ‘The problem is that Greece has lived beyond its means for a long time and that nobody wants to give Greece money any more without guarantees.’

Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis said his country was ready to ‘do whatever it takes to reach an agreement in the next two days’, but Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has said that his government needs time to carry out reforms and put the mismanagement of the past behind it.
