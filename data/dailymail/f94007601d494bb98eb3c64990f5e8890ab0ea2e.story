A Utah man serving life in prison for a double murder that he believes was directed by God says his ideas likely influenced a couple's decision to fatally overdose along with their children.

Dan Lafferty sees himself as the prophet Elijah and the world as hell, a philosophy that played into the September deaths of Benjamin and Kristi Strack.

He also claims that he and Kristi Strack fell in love, something her husband was aware of and didn't mind.

Tragedy: Benjamin and Kristi Strack and three of their children, Benson, 14, Emery, 12, and Zion, 11, were found dead inside their home in September. Their oldest son, who survived, is pictured left

Police say five members of the Utah family found dead last fall died from methadone and other drugs, and interviews with people who knew them revealed the parents worried about a 'pending apocalypse'

Lafferty is in prison for the 1984 slayings of his sister-in-law, Brenda Lafferty, and her 15-month old daughter, crimes which were chronicled in the 2003 Jon Krakauer book 'Under the Banner of Heaven.' 

The 66-year-old said he first became close to the Stracks about 10 years ago, after Kristi Strack had a dream about him while she was reading the book. 

She reached out to him, and eventually Kristi and Benjamin Strack became almost weekly visitors to the Utah State Prison. 

At one point, Lafferty cut off his waist-length hair and beard at her request and sent them to the family.

However, the friendship tapered off after the couple pleaded guilty to criminal charges including forgery and drug possession in 2008, which ended their prison visiting privileges.

They exchanged letters afterward, but Lafferty said Kristi Strack didn't believe he was Elijah, and when he persisted she quit answering his letters.

Questions: Authorities could not determine if Benson (pictured), who was 14 at the time, had been killed or if he had taken his own life. He was the only one not under the covers, suggesting he had been the last to die

Dan and Ron Lafferty are both in prison for the 1984 murders of Brenda Lafferty and her 15-month-old daughter, Erica.

They slit their victims' throats with a 10-inch boning knife and later claimed God had ordered the slayings. 

The men were tried separately; Dan Lafferty is serving a life sentence, and Ron Lafferty -- who claimed to have the revelation to kill -- is on death row.

The revelation to kill their brother's family came from Ron after Brenda spoke out against her husband Allen Lafferty joining his brother's radical polygamist group.

Ron said they needed to be 'removed' so that, as God put it, 'my work might go forward.'

According to investigators into the Strack case, Dan had not left behind his cult-leader mentality when Kristi first made contact with him.

Springville Police Corporal Greg Turnbow says that Dan communicated with Kristi like she was his child--a part of his flock.

Strack and her husband became close friends with Lafferty, who believes himself to be the prophet Elijah, for several years.

While the Stracks did have frequent communication with Lafferty, it did not generally include talks about the end of the world. 

The communication also ended in 2008 and police still aren't sure exactly what led them to commit suicide in September.

DAN'S IDEOLOGY - A 1,000-YEAR SEX PARTY

But Dan's ideology seems to point toward why the Stracks, who'd struggled with addiction for years, might have found him so alluring.

Dan explained to the Salt Lake City Weekly in a lengthy 2014 profile that, as a devout Mormon child, he struggled with seductions of the flesh.

'When I was young and going to church, I thought because I couldn’t stop masturbating, that I might be an evil person, and it tormented me so much that I contemplated castration as a possible way to stop offending God,' he said.

So, as an adult, he began to see such desire not as a test from God, but as one of his gifts.

He believes the righteous will be treated to a 1,000-year party during which they'll be filled with the light of Jesus and have sex the likes of which have not before been experienced on Earth.

As the prophet Elijah, Dan believes it is his duty--as the only one who can see the continual cycle that begins at birth and starts over with the thousand-year party--to cull from the Earth the 'weeds' of the Devil that have grown for 6,000 years.

Only when he personally replaces these weeds with God's righteous 'wheat' can the 1,000 party begin again.

'When he comes back,' Dan says of his God of Love, 'he’s gonna be smoking a doobie, saying, "Tired of this world? Well, it’s time to party." I really believe it.'

Lafferty says he hadn't talked to the couple for years and didn't know of their plans or mindset.

'I'll miss them, but I'm happy for them,' he said. 'I believe they're in paradise now.'

Lafferty, who is polite and friendly in conversation, has a self-devised philosophy that he refers to as his insanity; though he says he's not crazy.

'My 'insanity' messes with people's lives,' he said. 'It's just the way it is.'

Strack and her husband believed that the apocalypse was near just before they killed themselves with a drug overdose and took their three children with them. 

Friends and family thought that meant they would one day move somewhere remote and live 'off the grid,' but no one thought they'd kill themselves, police said. 

Police still aren't sure exactly what led them to commit suicide in September.  

But Lafferty communicated with Kristi Strack like she was one of his children, police said. 

When she suffered a bout with ovarian cancer, there was talk about Lafferty being able to cure it.

Investigation: Chief Scott Finlayson speaks during a news conference about the Strack family on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2015, at Springville, Utah

On Tuesday, Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson said authorities concluded their investigation into the deaths and said the cause was 'drug toxicity'.

Benjamin Strack, 37, hadn't been to work for a week when Kristi Strack's older son from a previous marriage found the family's bodies in a locked bedroom Sept. 27. 

Police found traces of a lethal drug mixture in a child's sand pail in the room.

Investigators also found several empty methadone bottles, 10 empty boxes of nighttime cold medicine and two boxes of allergy medicine in their garbage, along with a red liquid in Pepsi cups.

They also found a pitcher of red juice, a purple bucket with yellow liquid, a bag of marijuana and other medications, including sleeping pills, inside the home.

Mr Strack had high levels of heroin in his system, while his wife had methadone, dextrorphan, diphenhydramine and doxylamine in her system, and both deaths were ruled as suicides.

All three children died from diphenhydramine and methadone; the two youngest children's deaths were ruled homicides.
