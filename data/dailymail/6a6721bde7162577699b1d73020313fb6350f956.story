From her first name to her religion, much has changed in the life of the wife of the Sydney siege gunman - herself on bail for the alleged murder his former wife and who allegedly featured in videos where she described herself as a 'terrorist'.

Before Amirah Droudis, 35, married Man Haron Monis, the self-styled Sheikh behind this week's deadly sixteen-hour siege, she was known by a different first name - Anastasia, a nod to her Greek heritage.

Born to Greek Orthodox migrants who live in Belmore, southwest Sydney, Droudis worked as a hairdresser in Sydney's Kings Cross during her late teenage years.

As a young adult, she would often visit bars and party with friends, a source previously close to her told Daily Mail Australia.

But after she met the Iranian fanatic who this week took eighteen people hostage in a terrifying 16-hour siege that left two hostages and the gunman dead, Droudis dropped her birth name in favour for Amirah, an Arabic name, and reportedly converted to Islam.

'She's been Anastasia for 30 years,' the source said. 'You can't just turn around and say, "I'm whatever now"'.

Like Monis, Droudis has had repeated run-ins with the law - and like Monis she remains free despite being charged with serious crimes, including murder.

The source said she became 'influenced' by Monis after the two struck up a relationship following the collapse of her former relationship with her previous partner of eight years.

Amirah's brother, John Aspros, told Daily Mail Australia this week that Monis often spent time at the home of Amirah's parents, which was raided by NSW Police officers following the bloody end to the Lindt cafe siege on Tuesday.

Droudis declined to comment outside her home and later reported to Campsie Police Station, where she is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions for the alleged murder of Monis' estranged wife, Noleen Hayson Pal.

Police allege Droudis stabbed Pal eighteen times in her Werrington apartment and set her on fire. Monis was on bail charged with being an accessory to the murder when he entered the cafe and took his hostages.

A court was told earlier this year that Droudis and Monis vigorously denied the murder allegations and would plead not guilty.

Four years before the alleged murder, a woman believed to be Droudis, posted a series of chilling videos on YouTube in which she described acts of terrorism as God’s will. The videos bear the address of Monis’ website.

'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I'll try not to be anymore,' says the woman, 'Amirah', in one of the videos, whose face is mostly covered by a niqab.

In another video post, the women describes acts including the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the Bali bombings as 'acts of God.'

'Yes, we are happy about the punishment of September 11. Yes, we are happy about the punishment in Bali. Yes, we are happy about the punishment of the Holocaust and any other punishment that God sends to us.'

The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid.

At around the same time both Monis and Droudis were charged with sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan.

Relatives said the letters accused the troops of killing innocent children, among other things. Monis and Droudis were eventually convicted and sentenced to community service.

In addition to the murder accessory charge, Monis was facing more than 40 sexual assault charges involving seven women that allegedly took place while he posed as a 'spiritual adviser'. Droudis was not involved in that case.

Sydney lawyer Manny Conditsis, who represented Monis and Droudis in court, told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that Droudis was a pleasant client to work with.

‘She’s always extremely courteous, pleasant,' he said. 'But… it’s also fair to observe that she would defer to Monis.'
