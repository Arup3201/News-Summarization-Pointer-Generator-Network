The outlook for the British economy has improved by more than any other developed nation over the last six months, an international watchdog declared yesterday.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said it now expects the UK economy to grow by 1.4 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent in 2014.

That is far stronger than growth rates of 0.8 per cent and 1.5 per cent predicted in May, marking the biggest upgrade for any of the world’s major economies.

The UK is now forecast to grow by 2.4 per cent in 2014, up from the OECD's prediction in May of 1.5 per cent

The forecast provided further good news for George Osborne ahead of next month’s Autumn Statement.

The Chancellor is expected to report that borrowing will be much lower than expected this year as the recovery boosts tax receipts.

The upgrade to the UK’s prospects came as the OECD cut its growth forecast for the global economy from 3.1 per cent to 2.7 per cent for this year and from 4 per cent to 3.6 per cent for 2014.

It expects output in the eurozone to contract by 0.4 per cent this year before growing by just 1 per cent in 2014.

The OECD said economic activity in Britain has 'picked up and 
broadened', supported by a turnaround in private sector confidence and 
continued monetary stimulus.

It also noted how government 
intervention in the housing market, including its mortgage lending 
schemes, was helping to fuel the recovery.

It said: 'Growth is projected to 
strengthen further in 2014 and 2015, mainly supported by an upturn in 
gross fixed investment and exports. 

'Despite exceeding the inflation 
target of 2 per cent, headline inflation is projected to fall gradually in the 
next two years.'

The Treasury said the report ‘provides more evidence that the UK’s hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity’ despite the uncertain outlook around the world.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney has vowed to keep interest rates at historic lows, at least until unemployment rates fall below 7 per cent.

The OECD welcomed efforts to put banks back on a firmer financial footing, and warned against a change of course.

'While headline deficits are 
expected to shrink as growth recovers, it is important to maintain 
existing consolidation plans to restore fiscal sustainability,' it said.

And it urged the government to do more to stimulate housebuilding to prevent a new property price bubble.

'Further 
relaxing the barriers holding back housing supply is an important policy
priority to contain house price inflation.'

David Cameron has vowed to press ahead with planning reforms, warning that opponents in rural areas are killing off the chances of young people achieving the ‘dream of home ownership’.

The Prime Miinster said: ‘Planning reform is important. 
It’s important that we build more houses because the average age of the 
first-time buyer has crept into the 30s, and I believe in a socially 
mobile society where people can achieve their dream of home ownership.’

The OECD said the overall global recovery was 'real' but moving at a 'slow speed' and warned that there could be further turbulence ahead, warning that political brinkmanship over the US economy could derail progress.

A Treasury spokesman said: 'The OECD have revised their forecast for UK GDP up by more than any other G7 country over the next two years.

'This provides more evidence that the UK's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity. Today's report also highlights the risks that remain to the recovery and urges the UK to stick to the Government's plan that is growing the economy, lowering the deficit and inflation, and creating jobs.

'This is the only sustainable way to raise living standards for hard-working families.'

But Labour's Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the treasury, said: 'After three damaging years of flatlining this OECD forecast for the UK is welcome, but for millions of families this is still no recovery at all. As the OECD says, real wages are still falling in Britain.

'In fact working people are on average £1600 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office.'
