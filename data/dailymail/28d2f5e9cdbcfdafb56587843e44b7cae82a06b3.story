Just as Rapunzel used her hair to help her prince up to her castle, a woman from China is using her own long locks for good - by auctioning them off to raise money for a run-down school.

Xiao Yeh, from the city of Shenzhen in the northern province of Shandong, lives thousands of miles from the school she is trying to help - but that has not stopped her from feeling inspired to chop off her locks, which drop to a full two metres (6ft).

The 38-year-old has been growing her crowning glory for more than 15 years, and once turned down an offer of £2,000 to have it cut. 

Hair today... gone tomorrow: Xiao Yeh, 38, is getting her two-metre long locks chopped off for charity

But after hearing about the awful conditions students were enduring at a school in south China, she decided the time was right. 

'I read about the terrible conditions students at a middle school were suffering in the region of Ningxia and thought I had to do something,' she said. 

 'The only thing I have to donate is my hair so I set up an online auction to sell it off to the highest bidder.'

The bidding has already gone past £1,000, and is not stopping yet. 

Let your hair down! Ms Yeh has been growing her hair for more than 15 years, but is not scared to cut it

Ms Yeh added: 'I didn't grow my hair long until I entered university, since female students weren't allowed to grow long hair in high school.

'My hair grew very quickly and I remember once when I got up to use the bathroom, my waist-long hair seemed to scare other students.

'I got a bit self conscious about it and later didn't like to walk on the street with it down in case it got too much attention.'

Her beauty regime included no chemical products and just the occasional trim to get rid of split ends.

'It takes an hour to wash, ten minutes to comb through and a whole day to dry' she said.

'The hairdresser used to tell me, "Whenever I cut your hair I have to crawl around the floor".

'I'm sure I'll miss it and I know my husband will but it's for a good cause and I can always grow it back.'
