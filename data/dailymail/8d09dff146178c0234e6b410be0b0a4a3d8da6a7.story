British taxpayers will be contributing to a new £2.35 million a year welcome centre for UK-bound illegal migrants in Calais, it emerged today.

The bill will be added to the £12million the British government has already pledged to the French to improve security in the port town this year.

During a visit to Calais on Monday, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve signed an agreement to ensure the new facility will be open by January.

Mayor of Calais Natacha Bouchart, pictured, said there were currently 2,500 migrants living in the town 

But aid groups warned the centre could turn into an expensive 'ghetto' that will become a magnet for thousands more asylum seekers who want to make the journey across the English Channel.

Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will have 'a budget of more than three million euros a year, which the state will be asking the European Union for.'

Britain pays more than £8bn a year to the EU, meaning UK money will certainly end up being used to welcome the migrants to Calais, who currently number around 2,500.

Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will be housed in a collection of prefabricated buildings close to the docks, where migrants try to get on lorries every day.

The facility will serve at least 1,500 meals a day, and provide heating toilets and showers as well as beds for the most vulnerable.

The new centre has raised the prospect of a new Sangatte - the Red Cross centre which became a magnet for migrants before it was shut down as part of an Anglo-French agreement in 2002.

In a statement, Emmaus France, the migrant charity, said the new centre would become 'a ghetto', giving 'migrants invisibility' as they prepared to continue their dangerous journeys.

Even Jean-Marie Alexandre, president of La Vie Active (Active Living), which will be running the centre, has voiced his concerns.

'It will of course be complicated,' said Mr Alexandre. 'It's a risk that we're taking, above all for our reputation. In this matter, we have more to lose than we have to gain.'

Mr Alexandre said: 'We will be managers of this welcome centre on the condition that it is legitimate and that security is assured.'

Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart said last week that some 2,500 migrants currently in the area were 'willing to die' to take advantage of British social security benefits.

The black economy in Britain is estimated to be worth some £80bn a year, four times the size of France's, so cash-in-hand jobs are attractive to asylum seekers in the UK.

Ms Bouchart said the British government had done nothing to suggest to potential migrants that there was no 'El Dorado' for them in the UK, and that the situation was far worse than 11 years ago, when Sangatte was shut. 

The Sangatte camp was closed in 2002 and demolished following an agreement between Britain and France
