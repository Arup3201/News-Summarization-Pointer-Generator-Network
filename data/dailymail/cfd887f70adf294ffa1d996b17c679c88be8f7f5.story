Ritual: Chun Michael Deng died after being knocked unconscious during a fraternity hazing

Police investigating the Sunday death of a college freshman found drugs and torture documents in the rural Pennsylvania home where the hazing occurred.

Chun 'Michael' Deng, 19, died after a brutal hazing incident left him brain dead last weekend, but police investigating the death found even more damning evidence inside the remote home where Mr Deng met his fate.

Investigators discovered hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, paddles and a photocopy of pages from a book about torture, according to an affidavit cited by multiple media outlets.

Police believe Mr Deng was injured during a hazing ritual called the 'Glass Ceiling,' where people 
are blindfolded and made to carry 20 pounds of sand in a back while members of Pi Delta Psi repeatedly tackled him.

Mr Deng was tackled one too many times, he lied in the snow unresponsive after being knocked unconscious after hitting his head.

Fraternity brothers are believed to have carried him inside where they set him down and changed his clothes as others looked up his symptoms on the internet, police said.

Deng was reported to be unconscious 
and unresponsive immediately after he fell... Deng was then carried inside and placed by a fire and continued to be unresponsive,' said the affidavit.

'Deng was then carried inside and placed by a fire and continued to be unresponsive.'

They did not take Mr Deng to a hospital for more than an hour, and when the group finally arrived at the hospital he was declared brain dead.

Mr Deng, died from head injuries on Monday, after three fellow students took him to the hospital at about 6.40am on Sunday.

He had been knocked unconscious around 5am Sunday morning.

Quick to realize they had a problem on their hands, brothers from Baruch frantically removed
fraternity-related items from the Pennsylvania home, police said.

Members of the fraternity had initially said Mr Deng had hurt himself while wrestling in snow outside the rented property, about 100 miles from the Manhattan campus.

A Pennsylvania prosecutor has said charges in the case are expected once the police investigation ends.

The level of charges and who specifically will be charged is not clear, Monroe County District Attorney E. David Christine told CNN.

The fraternity also moved to quickly mitigate any further hazing.

'As
a result of this incident, we are immediately suspending all new member
education nationwide until further notice,' national president Andy 
Meng said in a statement.

The
Monroe County District Attorney's office said the 19-year-old was injured at a Tunkhannock Township residence, 
where about 30 members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity had traveled for 
the weekend.

The township is in northeastern Pennsylvania, about 100 miles west of New York City.Â 

Mr Deng, a freshman at Baruch College, was one of four students pledging to the fraternity in the hazing ritual, the practice of humiliating and torturing newcomers as part of their fraternity initiation.

Pocono
Mountain Regional Police Chief Harry Lewis told NBC News that the 
pledges were told they had to get from one point to another while 
blindfolded.

Mr Deng never saw it coming.

Local authorities have pledged to charge anyone involved in the blindfolded teen's death, and that there may be dozens of charges, according to reports.

The sheer volume of charges is such that they are likely be announced next week at the earliest, officials said.

Baruch College announced late Friday that the fraternity has been suspended from campus, an internal review and the results of the criminal investigation will determine which disciplinary action the school takes against individuals.

The group identifies itself as 'an Asian American Cultural Fraternity'
founded in 1994, with a mission 'to spread Asian American Cultural 
awareness.'

In a statement, Baruch said 'the
preliminary reports indicate that Michael died over the weekend while 
participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event.'

'Baruch 
College had no knowledge of this event or that the fraternity was 
rushing a pledge class. Pi Delta Psi did not request permission nor were
they approved by Baruch on this matter.'

The
school also said that it has a 'zero tolerance policy regarding hazing'
and that all fraternities and sororities are required to attend an 
orientation session that includes anti-hazing training, and sign 
statements that they understand the policies

'Michael's
death is a deeply painful reminder that no individual should ever be 
put into a position where his or her personal safety is in jeopardy. Our
deepest sympathies go out to Michael's family and his friends.'

No arrests have yet been made in the death.
