When Belle Gibson was given the shocking news five years ago that she had terminal brain cancer, she quickly decided conventional medical treatments were taking a heavy toll on her body.

After undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation, the Melbourne mother decided to try something less invasive and harsh and starting using holistic medications and whole foods.

The move not only prolonged her life, but inspired her to design a food and lifestyle app, called The Whole Pantry, which proved so popular  she was flown out to Silicone Valley where she was told her app was to be included on the Apple Watch, unveiled last week.

Belle Gibson founder and developer of The Whole Pantry app revealed she's spent the last month working on the Apple Watch in California

'It didn’t take me long to notice the stress conventional medicine was putting on my body so I started looking for an alternative,' Ms Gibson told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was lying there one night and I read an article about how lemon in water can act as a natural detox something clicked and that's when I changed the way I ate and lived.'

Ms Gibson only eats foods that are free from genetically modified organisms, gluten, dairy and sugar.

It was the cancer that pushed her to develop the world's first health, wellness and lifestyle app, The Whole Pantry, which encourages healthy eating and has community groups to help those looking to live more wholesome lifestyles.

The app launched in August 2013 and was downloaded 200,000 times in the first month. 

Its success led Apple to come knocking when the tech company went looking for hip new apps to include on its newest must-have item, the Apple Watch - developed in the highest secrecy before its launch last week.

A month ago, Ms Gibson received a phone call from Apple HQ asking her to fly to Silicon Valley to work with them on a secret project.

Only then was it revealed the secret project was the Apple Watch.

The app's icon is featured front and centre on the Apple Watch's face.

'The fact that Apple have supported me and The Whole Pantry is huge considering how small our team is and the fact it is our first app,' Ms Gibson said.

The app developed by Ms Gibson and co-designer Alex Benevento helps make the Apple Watch more user-friendly and hands-free.

She is now 25 and the mother of a three-year-old son, Oliver. The tumour in her brain is still there, and regular seizures act as painful reminders of her condition.

'At Oli's party I collapsed in pain and had multiple seizures over the following 40 minutes. This is the worst I've ever been with them. I have seizures often as a result of my brain cancer, but nothing ever this long or intense,' she said.

She refers to the app as an entry-point for people wanting to start a more wholesome way of life. It is loaded with recipes, product recommendations and tips.

It has also become a community of supporters and people who share her philosophy of only putting natural things into her body.

Ms Gibson was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and only given four months to live in 2009, today she is a leading app developer encouraging people to lead more wholesome lives via her app, The Whole Pantry

Just a month after it's release the app already had 200,000 downloads. Belle Gibson the founder donates 95 per cent of the profits to charities and organisations

Cook Mode is the new feature which the Apple Watch will be helpful with as you will be able to have a recipe to swipe step-buy-step from without taking up any bench space.

Another new feature that will be coming soon is one where the Apple Watch will be able to detect what items you need off your The Whole Pantry shopping list and remind you to buy them when near a grocery store.

'It makes shopping for recipe items that much easier if the experience is hands-free.'

The app will be relaunched in a few months so that it can be compatible with the new and current devices and will have 450 new recipes.

The wholefoods movement is based around getting back to basics and eating unprocessed or refined food

The app is no ordinary recipe app, it encourages people to make changes within their lives.

'We are not trying to convert people from one diet to another. We are just tying to encourage people to eat more whole foods and move their bodies.'

A book carrying the same name as the app will be launched through Penguin in October.

'I just got the first hard copy of the book and I'm so excited Ms Gibson said, 'I just am forever grateful to my team and my online community who I wake up for every morning.'

The Whole Pantry app developer Belle Gibson will soon release a book featuring 80 new recipes and a starter guide to a wholesome lifestyle
