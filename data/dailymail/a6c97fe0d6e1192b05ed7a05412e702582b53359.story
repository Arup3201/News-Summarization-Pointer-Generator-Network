With her ribs visible beside her slender arms, anorexic 21-year-old Holly Griffiths looks barely able to carry herself, let alone a growing child.

Incredibly, however, she is eight months pregnant, her tiny frame hiding an almost fully-formed baby.

Pictures of the young woman, who weighs just 8st 1lb and is 5ft 7in tall, have emerged as she battles to put on weight to keep her unborn child healthy.

Holly Griffiths, 21, has battled anorexia since she was a child. She managed to give birth to a healthy baby boy called Dylan (pictured) when she was 19 and now is pregnant with a little girl she has named Isla

Miss Griffiths has struggled with 
eating problems for 13 years but has already given birth to one healthy 
child, a son called Dylan, now two, despite also risking his life in 
pregnancy to keep herself thin.

Normally, pregnant women are expected
 to consume about 2,000 calories a day but Miss Griffiths makes do with 
between 800 and 1,200, eating one slice of toast for breakfast, salad 
for lunch, and plain pasta for dinner.

She has to see a high-risk maternity 
doctor, but a 4D scan of the child, who she has named Isla, shows she 
currently looks healthy.

Despite being 32 weeks pregnant Miss Griffiths does not look as if she is pregnant at all. She is trying to put on as much weight as possible for her baby before she is induced in three weeks

‘I know I have to eat for the baby, 
but it’s hard to push the voices away that are telling me I’m fat,’ said
 Miss Griffiths from Greenwich, South London, who is engaged to the 
child’s father, gym manager Harrison Bogbanovs, 24. ‘When I first 
discovered I was pregnant I was terrified of having to gain weight 
again.

‘I suffered terrible morning sickness which caused my weight to drop, triggering my anorexia

'I had thoughts of purging but didn’t
 need to, my body was reacting in its own way. This made eating a lot  
easier, because I would just vomit it up anyway.’

When Miss Griffiths was pregnant with Dylan she was so thin that one of her ribs cracked as the baby grew.

Miss Griffiths (pictured, left, age six) developed anorexia when she was eight after ballet classes put pressure on her to lose weight. She has fought the condition for years and has gained a healthy weight for short periods of time. In summer last year she relapsed (right) and plummeted to seven stone despite being 5'7"

She was induced at 37 weeks and gave birth after a labour of only ten minutes.

Dylan weighed 5lb 10oz and, to her 
relief, was healthy. ‘I was so lucky he was OK,’ she said. ‘I felt so 
guilty I had put his life at risk.’

Miss Griffiths was eight when she 
started battling with her weight. She blames her condition on the 
pressure to look skinny in a leotard while taking ballet classes.

By 12 she had been admitted to a children’s psychiatric clinic weighing just 5st 5lb – about 3st underweight.

Miss Griffiths admits that when she was told that she was pregnant with her first child Dylan she was terrified. She said she should have been over the moon but was upset she would not longer be able to control her weight

Miss Griffiths (pictured with fiance Harrison Bogbanovs after the birth of Dylan) was so small that when Dylan was in her womb he cracked her rib and started to crush her lungs. Because of this she was induced at 37 weeks

Now, at 34 weeks pregnant, she is 
determined to gain 3lb before she gives birth to Isla. It is planned 
that she will be induced in three weeks.

‘Thankfully my baby girl is a healthy size and the doctors are happy with my progress,’ she added.

‘I’m desperate to recover so I can teach my kids a healthy way to approach food.

'I couldn’t bear it if they had body issues like me, so I’m continuing to fight the voices in my head and get better for them.’

Dylan was born a healthy, but slightly low, 5lb 10oz and has suffered no ill effects after his mother carried him while battling an eating disorder. Miss Griffiths hopes the same will happen with daughter Isla

Miss Griffiths is pictured looking a slightly healthier weight while on holiday with her partner Harrison and baby Dylan. Miss Griffiths goes into periods of remission but is prone to relapses.

Miss Griffiths has recorded her pregnancy with photographs. She is pictured 20 weeks pregnant (left) and then three weeks later (right).

The anorexic mother is pictured with a very small bump forming when she is 25 weeks pregnant (left). At 32 weeks (right) a slightly larger bump can be seen, but it is still much smaller than most expectant mothers

Miss Griffiths is hoping that she can overcome her eating disorder to ensure that her children to not develop the same relationship with food as they grow older
