Beyonce has finally admitted that she didn't sing live during her performance of the National Anthem on Inauguration Day.

The 31-year-old singer explained that she sang over a pre-recorded track - because she didn't have time to rehearse with the orchestra for the big day on January 21.

Her admission came on Thursday as she attended a press conference in New Orleans ahead of her Super Bowl half-time spectacular on Sunday where, she insists, she will be singing live.

No backing track now! Beyonce began her Super Bowl press conference on Thursday by performing the National Anthem live

Clearly knowing she would be 
quizzed over the lip-synching controversy by the packed room of 
journalists, Beyonce first addressed the matter by singing another 
rendition of The Star Spangled Banner- this one a live, unaccompanied, a cappella.Â 

The floor was then opened to questions, where Beyonce explained how she wanted her performance for President Barack Obama to be a memorable one - and called the day 'emotional'.

Controversial: The singer admitted sang over a pre-recorded backing track during her performance of the national anthem at 
President Barack Obama's inauguration on January 21

Beyonce, wearing a very short white 
dress with open back, said: 'I am a perfectionist, I will practise until
my feet bleed but I didn't get a chance.

'The
inauguration was about the president I wanted to make him and the 
country proud. I decided to sing along with my pre-recorded track which 
is something that is common in the music industry.

'I always sing live, 
the inauguration was unfortunately a time when I didn't have time to 
rehearse with the the orchestra because I was rehearsing for the Super 
Bowl.

'I'm very proud of my performance,' she added.

Speaking about the Super Bowl, she 
continued: 'I will absolutely be singing live, I am well-rehearsed. This
is what I am born for.

'I've
had a 16 year career and everything I've done has prepared me for this,
I'm ready.

'It is something we've been preparing for for about four or 
five months but I am nervous.'

She was well-prepared to answer a barrage of questions at Thursday's Super Bowl junket in New Orleans.

But as Beyonce graciously answered reporters' inquiries into forthcoming half-time performance and why she sang with a pre-recorded track for President Obama's inauguration, there was one burning question the singer wasn't expecting: 'What colour is your toothbrush?'

Heads turned toward a gentleman from Denmark who asked the singer the trivial question, in addition to, 'Why did you choose that color?', irritating journalists in the room looking for hard-hitting news.

Proving professional, the 31-year-old answered: 'It's blue and white. Blue and white, I think. Blue and yellow maybe?'

While it has been speculated Beyonce 
will be joined on stage at the half-time show by her Destiny's Child 
bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, the singer refused to 
give away any details.

She said: 'I can't give away any details but I
will say there is nothing like our connection and the sisterhood we 
have. It's always a pleasure to be around them personally and 
professionally.'

Beyonce, 31, also revealed she can't wait until her 
performance is over so that she can spend time with her husband Jay-Z 
and their 12-month-old daughter, Blue Ivy.

She explained: 'I can't 
wait until it's all over, I'm gonna enjoy my daughter. I miss her so 
much and I keep saying, "Mommy is so busy but I'll be done at 9pm on 
Sunday."'

The busy singer's HBO documentary Life Is But A Dream 
will air on February 16 and while she is nervous about sharing her ups 
and downs with everyone, Beyonce wanted to make the movie for Blue Ivy's
sake.

She said: 'I'm very nervous about reaction to my documentary.

me and I'm scared but I'm happy.

'My daughter has changed me and 
changed my life and given me so much purpose.

'This movie is necessary 
and shows a human side. My job is to protect her and I am happy to tell 
my life story on my own terms.'
