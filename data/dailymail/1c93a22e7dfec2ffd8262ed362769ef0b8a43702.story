With a rooftop pool, an indoor football pitch and a private climbing wall, Google’s vision for its Kings Cross headquarters sounded more like a giant holiday camp than an office.

The architect’s plans showed pictures of staff cycling between meetings, and lounging about in cosy nooks in a carefully manicured roof garden.

But Google boss Larry Page ordered the extravagant plans to be ripped up because they were too boring.

Mr Page, who co-founded the American technology giant, ordered the UK team to go back to the drawing board and come up with a building worthy of existing for 100 years.

Google originally hoped that the £1bn development would be ready in 2016, but that deadline is now looking more than a little ambitious. Building work on the site behind Kings Cross has not started, putting the project at least a year behind schedule.

From the outside, the shelved plans looked like an office block that might have belonged to any wealthy company. Up to 4,500 staff would have been housed in a glassy, 11-storey, structure, occupying a narrow, wedge-shaped strip of land behind Kings Cross station.

The building’s most distinguishing features were its spacious interiors and extensive facilities. 

Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, the architecture firm which was primarily responsible for the plans, said it would be ‘organised around a looped three-dimensional promenade’, and ‘sit upon a retail plinth punctuated by three generous light-filled halls’.

Cycling ramps, terraces and a large roof garden were supposed to create an ‘easy and enjoyable journey that encourages encounter’.

‘The idea is that the people who are in the building…need to be attracted to the actual building,’ architect Simon Allford said, shortly after the blueprint was unveiled.

Camden Council gave its blessing to the project by granting it planning permission, but it was not good enough to please the powers that be at Google’s global headquarters.

Mr Page scrapped the design, and ordered the team to come up with a new, more ‘Googly’ building, whose exterior lived up to its zany interior.

Joe Borrett, the company’s European real estate boss, said that it would still build on the site.

‘King’s Cross is Google’s future home in London. As we raise our ambitions on what we can achieve in developing our own building, this will inevitably take some additional time. We look forward to working with our partners and local community as our new designs come together.’

Google is known for its unusual offices around the world, which often feel more like a playground than a work space. The sprawling Mountainview site boasts an on-site bowling alley, a volleyball court, yurt-shaped meetings rooms and ‘pods’ for staff who want to sleep, not to mention 19 free restaurants and 60 snack kitchens. Meanwhile, Google’s offices in London’s Victoria includes a room stocked with musical instruments, like a teenage boy’s fantasy bedroom.

The extraordinary campuses are designed using data about staff movements at work, helping to create an environment which works them harder, and makes many employees reluctant to leave.

However, Google has always tended to refit existing offices, instead of designing its own building.

Sources said bosses were eyeing the Kings Cross site as a chance to do things differently.

Google has temporarily handed over part of the site to the award-winning production of The Railway Children, which has built a 1,000-seat theatre to host the show whilst the technology company goes to work on the new designs.
