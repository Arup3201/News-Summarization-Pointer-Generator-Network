British police are to hunt for the ‘Mr Bigs’ running Romanian gangs that are now behind more than 90 per cent of cashpoint thefts in this country, the Mail can reveal.

Officers will work with their Romanian counterparts to target the gangsters orchestrating the crimes which are netting an estimated £40 million a year.

New figures reveal a sharp rise in the crimes by Romanian gangs and there are fears this will rise further with a new wave of immigrants expected to arrive in the UK from January.

In the first six months of this year, fraud from ‘skimmed’ or ‘cloned’ cards rose 15 per cent to £23.2 million, compared to £20.2 million the same period in 2012.

UK cash machine fraud also rose by 11 per cent (corr) to £16.2 million in the first half of 2013, compared to £14.6 million in the first six months of 2012.

Earlier this year it emerged that the number of thefts related to ATMs has trebled.

There were some 7,572 cash machine card thefts in the first four months of the year, up from 2,553 during the same period in 2012.

Police intelligence suggests 92 per cent are linked to Romanian immigrants already in the UK.

The losses suffered as a result of ATM thefts run into many millions of pounds, sources said.

The Mail can reveal a major operation involving British and Romanian police is under way to identify the gangs behind the crime wave.

UK detectives believe several ‘top level’ gangsters, based in Romania, are orchestrating the misery being inflicted on UK card users.

Techniques such as skimming involve putting a reader over the card slot then collecting data as the card enters the machine

Senior Home Office figures are said to be ‘nervous’ about the crime surge.

Detectives fear some criminals will be among the Romanians who will be entitled to settle in the UK when border controls are dropped in the New Year.

They will join scores of Romanian thieves and fraudsters already established here and who now, according to well-placed sources, dominate certain categories of card crime.

A spokesman for the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit at City of London Police told the Mail yesterday that the £23.2million losses in counterfeit fraud includes all fraud perpetrated as a result of UK cards being copied.

Much of this fraud takes place in countries outside the UK that have not fully implemented chip and PIN, he said.

The £16.2million lost through UK cash machine fraud is where the compromised card is used at a UK cash machine irrespective of how the card is compromised and so includes use of lost/stolen cards, counterfeit cards and cards ‘intercepted in transit’, he added.

The spokesman added: ‘Overall levels of card fraud have dropped by 29% since a peak in 2008. With the introduction of enhanced security features, such as Chip & PIN, criminals have resorted to deception thefts.

'These basic techniques include shoulder-surfing and distraction thefts at ATMs - resulting in an increase in incidents at cash machines - which our unit is tackling head on.’

Asked to comment on reports that Romanian criminals are responsible for more than 90 per cent of ATM thefts, he said: ‘That figure relates to police intelligence from 2010, however the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit remains focussed on the involvement of Romanian criminal gangs in ATM crime, amongst other threats to the payment industry from organised crime.’

The latest annual figures show that, in 2012, the top five countries for fraudulent activity on UK issued cards were USA (£23.4m), France (£7.9m), Luxembourg (£6.9m), Italy (£5.4m) and Ireland (£5.2m).

The DCPCU spokesman said officers are currently working on an 18 month project which is funded in the main by the European Commission and will be focusing on Romanian organised criminality targeting the UK payments industry.

‘For operational reasons there are no further details we can release at this time,’ he said.

The Mail has learned that officers have identified a number of ‘Mr Bigs’ in the Romanian city of Bacau. A source said: ‘They are very clever criminals who have made vast sums of money out of card crime in the UK, but who are difficult to pin down.’

Gang members working for the crime barons will typically crowd customers withdrawing cash to read their four-digit PIN, then distract them to steal the card. In some cases they install a simple metal sleeve in the slot which means the card is not returned to the user.

Someone reads the PIN over the victim’s shoulder and then, when they have moved away, retrieves the card. Once the thieves have the card and PIN they can go on a shopping spree or use a hole in the wall machine to empty their victim’s account.

Another technique, shoulder surfing, involves distracting a user while another person takes their details (posed by models)

Last month Scotland Yard revealed that policemen from Romania and Poland are being drafted in to help British forces combat an Eastern European crime wave.

Met chiefs have recruited the officers, who have flown to the capital for a two-year ‘tour of duty’ to help identify and deport overseas offenders.

The special squad, comprising eight detectives from Romania and three officers from Poland, will join the Met on raids, interviews and working in custody suites to crosscheck records with their own police database.

The unprecedented move comes after it emerged last year that 28 per cent of the 300,000 suspects the Metropolitan Police arrests each year were foreign nationals, with Poles and Romanians at the top of the list.

More than 27,000 Romanian citizens have been held for serious offences in London in the past five years, including ten for murder, 142 for rape and 666 for other sex offences.

The number of Romanians arrested is second only to that of Poles, 34,905 of whom have been detained since 2008, including 84 for murder. Police hope that the new unit will disrupt major organised criminal networks including the fraud gangs originating from Bacau.

Last month it was revealed that fraud losses on UK credit and debit cards have risen by 17pc in a year as criminals, struggling against improving technology, turn to new forms of “low-tech” scams.

Some £216.1 million worth of card frauds were committed in the first six months of this year, according to Financial Fraud Action UK, which prevents crime on behalf of the financial services industry.

The total cost of fraud on debit and credit cards leapt 14 per cent last year, by £47 million to £388 million.

Fraud is expected to top £400 million this year.

In 2008 Romanian fraudster Adu Bunu, was jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning more than 2,000 cards, which allowed him to steal up to £1.1million.

Police found photographs that showed his young son rolling around in a mountain of stolen cash.
