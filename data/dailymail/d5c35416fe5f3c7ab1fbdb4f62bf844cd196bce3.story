Anyone who has ever received a dubious fortelling in a fortune cookie, take heed: A Bronx woman who used her lucky numbers, according to the cookie, has won $2 million.

Emma Duvoll, 75, dined out in Manhattan Chinese restaurant Sammy's Noodle Shop & Grill and cracked open her sweet end-of-meal treat to reveal five lucky numbers.

She used the numbers when purchasing a Powerball ticket for the February 1 draw for $193 million.

NBC reports that Duvoll bought the ticket in Pine Bush and realized the day after the draw that she'd won.

'I was surprised but pleased,' she told lottery officials.

The grandmother of eight and great-grandother of one told the New York Post she plays Powerball about once a month.

Duvoll was born in Switzerland and moved to the U.S. with her husband, Dwight, 86.

The pair raised two sons and owned a delicatessen in the Bronx.

The couple were watching at home when Duvoll's numbers came in.

Duvoll had managed to match the five numbers but had missed out on the Powerball.

The cookie's recommended numbers were 5, 12, 15, 27 and 38.

Matching five numbers automatically won Duvoll $1 million but she had chosen the Power Play option, which doubled her winnings.

Duvoll will receive a one-time payment of $1,246,085 after all required taxes.

She was in Manhattan Thursday, along with several other New York winners, to receive her prize.

'I took some time contemplating what I will do with the money,' Duvall said.

'I plan to invest most of it, and maybe take a trip to Switzerland to visit family.'

Employees at Sammy's Noodle Shop told the New York Post that they're all now believers in the cookie.
