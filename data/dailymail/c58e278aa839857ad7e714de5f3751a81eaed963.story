Manchester United's trip to bitter rivals Liverpool is the standout Premier League fixture that will be televised in March.

On Wednesday, broadcasters Sky Sports and BT Sport announced the 12 games they will show exclusively on their channels.

And the former's showing of Liverpool hosting United at Anfield on Sunday, March 22 will surely get bums on seats at home as England's most successful clubs go head to head once more.

Both sides are seeking a top-four spot and the hosts will be desperate to reverse the 3-0 defeat they suffered at Old Trafford in December after goals from Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie.

Earlier on the same day as part of their Super Sunday package, Sky will be broadcasting Southampton's trip to Chelsea.

The reverse fixture ended in a 1-1 draw at St. Mary's but was shrouded in controversy after Blues midfielder Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving, when replays showed he was in fact tripped in the penalty area by Matt Targett.

Over on BT Sport, Manchester United's trip to Newcastle is one of five Premier League clashes that they will show exclusively.

The midweek match on March 4 will evoke memories of classic encounters the pair have faced over the years at St James' Park - including when Eric Cantona had the decisive strike to give the Red Devils a 1-0 win during the 1995-96 title race.

Elsewhere, reigning champions Manchester City's home clash with West Brom will be televised as well as the Midlands derby between the Baggies and rivals Aston Villa.
