New rules: Theresa May accepted findings criticising police spying after the MoS report

Police will be banned from using anti-terror laws to spy on journalists to identify their sources, following a Mail on Sunday campaign.

The Home Office is to issue new instructions to police forces requiring them to seek authorisation from a judge before they can gain access to journalists’ phone records and other communications data.

It said the measure was being introduced as an ‘interim solution’ pending new legislation after the Election. 

It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May accepted the findings of an official inquiry triggered by a Mail on Sunday report that revealed how police trawled through phone records of this newspaper’s news desk in a bid to identify a confidential source.

The review by the Interception of Communications Commissioner (ICC) strongly criticised the way police had used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to access journalists’ data.

Police forces were found to have viewed the phone records of 82 journalists over the last three years via Ripa while failing to give adequate consideration to Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (freedom of expression).

Our report in October revealed that Kent Police detectives used Ripa to sidestep a judge’s ruling and snoop into The Mail on Sunday news editor’s telephone records in order to identify the source in the Chris Huhne speeding points story.

The following day, a review of the use of Ripa powers was launched by the ICC. The same law was used to trawl through the phone records of a Sun journalist in the Plebgate row.

Since then, many of those who helped draw up the original legislation, largely aimed at combating organised crime and terrorists, have admitted that the use of the law to spy on journalists was never envisaged.

Yesterday it was announced that police forces will now be told they must use the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which requires them to obtain the permission of a judge if they want to obtain details of a journalist’s phonecalls or emails.

The Government will also amend the Serious Crime Bill currently going through Parliament to ensure that a revised code of practice has ‘due regard to the public interest in protecting journalists’ sources’.

‘A free press is fundamental to a free society. The Government has accepted in full the recommendations of the ICC and we are determined to implement them as soon as is legally possible,’ a Home Office spokesman said.

 ‘So we are legislating as far as possible now until a Bill can be introduced in the next Parliament which delivers the recommendations in full.’

Former Labour Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who piloted Ripa through Parliament, said a long-term solution was needed.

‘It is better than nothing but something much more dramatic needs to be done. The long-term solution has got to be primary legislation,’ he told Radio 4’s Today programme.

At the time of our revelation, MPs warned that police use of Ripa to spy on journalists was a disproportionate use of power that would deter whistleblowers from approaching the media.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘It is deeply disturbing that police hacked into offices of a major newspaper. They have struck a serious blow against press freedom.’
