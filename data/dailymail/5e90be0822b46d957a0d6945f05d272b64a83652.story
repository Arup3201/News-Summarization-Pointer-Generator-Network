Tony Blair is to join the fight to get Ed Miliband elected, despite growing unease among New Labour grandees after the direction of the party.

The former prime minister has promised to do 'whatever the party wants' to secure a Labour victory in May.

Some senior Labour MPs argue that the three-times election winner remains a 'rock star' who can still win over voters, but there is unease among some of Mr Miliband's allies about turning the clock back to the Blair era.

Tony Blair is to join the fight to get Ed Miliband elected, despite growing unease among New Labour grandees after the direction of the party

Labour still has a narrow lead in the opinion polls but a survey today showed the party has been damaged by public rows with senior business leaders.

Mr Miliband is now widely seen as anti-business, with captains of industry who once backed Mr Blair now warning of the disastrous impact of a Labour victory in May's election. 

Last month Mr Blair warned that  fighting on a 'traditional left-wing' platform was a recipe for defeat for Labour, and was widely seen to have been a criticism of Mr Miliband's shift from the political centreground. 

On Friday it emerged two of Mr Blair's close New Labour allies - Lord Mandelson and Alastair Campbell - spoke to Alan Johnson about rumours he was willing to replace Mr Miliband as Labour leader.

Both men denied urging Mr Johnson to launch a leadership challenger, but it was seen as the latest sign of New Labour veterans' unhappiness with Mr Miliband.

However, Mr Blair has now signalled that he is ready to campaign for Labour in the run up to the general election in three months' time.

The former PM's office told The Observer that regarding 'his involvement in the party's election campaign, he will do whatever the party wants'.

However, MailOnline understands that there is unease among some of Mr Miliband's team, and MPs elected in 2010, about being seen to rely on Mr Blair for support.

Rows about delays to the Iraq War inquiry have reignited the division in the Labour party about Mr Blair's decision to back the 2003 invasion.

'I'm not sure we would want him,' said one Labour frontbencher. 'It would look a bit odd after Ed has done so much to distance himself from New Labour and Iraq and all of that.' 

Mr Blair campaigned in some seats in 2010, including Redditch for former home secretary Jacqui Smith, who went on to lose her seat

Mr Blair also campaigned in Oldham and Saddleworth, which Labour later won in an election re-run, and his appearance at Trimdon Labour club during the 2010 campaign was targeted by anti-Iraq war protesters

Half of voters think the Labour party has been damaged by recent attacks from senior business.

Industry leaders credited with the success of well-known chains including Boots, M&S, Pizza Express and Lastminute.com have turned their fire on Labour in recent days, warning victory for Mr Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe.

A YouGov poll for The Sunday Times shows 52 per cent of people think the criticism damages Labour, while only 7 per cent think it helps them.

Overall, some 43 per cent of voters think a Labour victory would be bad for British business while just 19 per cent think it would be good.

Only 19 per cent think Labour has the best policies towards British business, compared to 33 per cent who said the same of the Conservatives.

In a fresh blow, Chris Wright, founder of the music publishing giant Chrysalis who backed Labour in the run-up to the 2005 election, warned Labour risked stoking a 'politics of envy' that would damage Britain's economic prospects.

'In the current Labour leadership there's a vein of thought that is to some extent anti-wealth creator and antibusiness and that is a great shame,' he said.

However, others want to see Mr Blair back on the campaign trail, as he did in some seats in the run-up to the 2010 election when his great rival Gordon Brown was seeking election.

A shadow cabinet minister said: 'Tony is a rock star. In the right seats people still love seeing him, it is a bit of celebrity stardust on the campaign trail.'

A poll for the Observer showed the Opposition up one point from a fortnight ago on 34%, two ahead of the Conservatives, unchanged on 32 per cent.

Ukip dropped three points to 15 per cent in the Opinium research while the Greens and the Liberal Democrats both moved up two points to 8 per cent and 7 per cent respectively.

Mr Miliband remained significantly less well regarded than Tory Prime Minister David Cameron - with a satisfaction score of minus 26 to the PM's minus five.

Lord Mandelson, one of the architects of New Labour, said Mr Miliband  'will make a very good prime minister' and suggested  corporate leaders 'will become much more reassured' about the Opposition's stance by the time of May's general election.

The peer accepted that more needed to be done to counter the impression being created but said the criticism was a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the party's position.

'We've got two months to show that he can make the case,' he said.

'I believe he has, but I believe there is a determination also to portray him in a very negative way.'

He and ex-Downing Street media chief Mr Campbell contacted Mr Johnson over speculation that he was being lined up by MPs seeking to oust Mr Miliband.

But both countered a claim in the Financial Times they  'took soundings to see whether he was prepared to take over' insisting they did nothing more than ascertain from a friend that the rumours he was being lined up were untrue. 

Mr Johnson served in the Cabinet for six years and was seen as a safe pair of hands, popular with the media and the public.

After Mr Miliband won the Labour leadership he appointed Mr Johnson as shadow chancellor, but he remained in post for just three months, resigning after revelations about his wife having an affair.

However, many still view the former postman and trade union leader as a possible caretaker leader if Mr Miliband's woeful personal ratings risked prevent Labour winning the election.

New Labour supporters were seen as being closer to Mr Miliband's brother David, but he stepped down as an MP after losing the leadership against to his brother.

At least 40 Labour MPs are believed to have backed the abortive coup, which occurred weeks after the Labour leader's conference speech last autumn. 

Tensions between Mr Miliband and New Labour grandees have been renewed in recent days, after losing the support of business leaders seen as crucial to Mr Blair's three election triumphs. 

The leadership speculation came at the end of a week when captains of industry and entrepreneurs have lined up to warn against a Labour victory.

Business leaders credited with the success of well-known chains including Boots, M&S, Pizza Express and Lastminute.com have turned their fire on Labour in recent days, warning victory for Mr Miliband would plunge Britain into an economic catastrophe.

Sir Charles Dunstone, who was one of 63 signatories to a letter of support for Labour in 2005, told the Financial Times the business community felt 'isolated' by Labour's shift to the left.

'As a business person I'm frightened of an environment where there isn't sufficient emphasis put on growing the economy to grow tax receipts to spend more money,' he said.

However, Lord Levy, formerly Tony Blair's chief fundraiser who helped New Labour form close ties with business, said he was 'saddened' by the attacks on Mr Miliband.
