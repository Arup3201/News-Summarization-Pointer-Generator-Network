Two-thirds of Britons cannot say anything in a foreign language – with one fifth even unsure of what ‘bonjour’ means, a study claims.

The findings appear to confirm the cliche about Britons being notoriously bad at making an effort to speak the lingo when abroad.

Overall, 64 per cent of those polled admitted they did not know a single word in any language other than English.

Tongue-tied: Reasons for not trying to speak a local language included not being bothered, fear of making a mistake or expecting hosts to be able to speak English

And just one third – 34 per cent –  said they were willing to make an attempt at speaking a foreign language while on holiday.

One fifth (19 per cent) did not know the meaning of the French word for hello, one of the most recognisable foreign greetings in the world.

And 63 per cent had no idea what the Dutch word ‘goedemorgen’ meant, despite the obvious similarities to our own ‘good morning’.

Young Britons were found to be worst at making the effort, with nearly half – 47 per cent – of those aged 16 to 24 admitting they have never spoken the foreign language they learned at school.

'Una cerveza por favor': Unsurprisingly is one of the few phrases British people seem to understand

But 45 per cent of the over-55s said they liked to try to speak the local language when abroad, the poll of 2,000 adults by travel website Hotels.com found.

It is compulsory for all pupils to study a foreign language up to the age of 14 and French, German and Spanish are all on the national curriculum.

Yet only one in ten of those polled considered themselves able to speak one of them.

Of these, a quarter could ask only ‘everyday questions’, 21 per cent  said they were limited to ‘hello’ and ‘goodbye’, and one in 50 claimed they  could understand everything said to them in another language, but were unable to reply.

The phrases they did take the trouble to learn were somewhat revealing of priorities.

Almost half – 43 per cent – knew ‘una cerveza por favor’ meant ‘a beer please’ in Spanish.

Reasons for not trying to speak a local language included not being  bothered, fear of making a mistake or expecting hosts to be able to speak English.

Hotels.com spokesman Kate Hopcraft said: ‘Brits often have a negative image abroad when it comes to languages, and it doesn’t seem to be anything we’ll be saying auf wiedersehen to any time soon.’
