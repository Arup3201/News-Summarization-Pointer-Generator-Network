Hearty diets, medical advancement and evolution have caused men to grow bigger and bigger (and bigger) than ever before.

So burgeoning are their waistlines and so sky-scraping their heads, in fact, that department store Debenhams has released a new mega-size of colossal clothing to cope with demand.

The XXXXXL size, found in their increasingly popular Big And Tall section, is the chain's largest ever, an enormous three-X leap from the former top dog, XXL.

Demand for outsized clothing has rocketed by 126 per cent in recent months, and looks set to climb even faster in the year ahead, says the fashion retailer.

The maximum size of trouser waistlines available in store is also increasing from 40 inches to 48 inches, to cater for the nation's burgeoning girth.

Says Lizzie Singleton, spokesperson for Debenhams: 'Many of these men are Lawrence Dallaglio lookalikes - big and strong rather than overweight.

'We're seeing the emergence of a new generation of super tall, big, British hunks - and they're having a considerable impact upon the world of fashion.'

The department store has seen a surge in men's height in recent years with the average trouser sold now having a 34 inch inside leg; this was previously 32 inch in 2011 and the range is now available up to a lengthy 36 inch.

Collar: 19.5'

Inside leg: 36'

Top: XXXL

Waist: 44'

This is welcome news to women, who ideally like their partners to be eight inches taller than themselves, according to a study by the University of Westminste.

Celebrity giants in the Big and Tall category include; Benedict Cumberbatch at a modest 6'1, Will Smith at 6'2, Hugh Jackman at 6'3, Jeremy Clarkson at an impressive 6'5 and towering Peter Crouch at 6'7.

National Statistics show that the average man measures in at 5'11 and he reaches his tallest height at age 20 which then starts to decline again at the age of 50.

Men's waist bands are also expanding; with the most popular size in the Debenhams Big & Tall category coming in at 44 inches.

The news of men's ballooning heights should please most women, who, according to a study by the University of Westminster, like their men eight inches taller than them
