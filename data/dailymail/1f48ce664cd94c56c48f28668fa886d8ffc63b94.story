Frank Carson's will states that 'the net value of [his] estate is nil'

He was performing just a few months before his death.

But despite taking part in around 80 events a year, Frank Carson died penniless it has emerged.

The 85-year-old Irish comic, famed for one-liners including ‘it’s a cracker’ and beloved to millions who watched him on television, died in February last year from stomach cancer.

His family were left with just £8,013 but once debts and expenses were paid his will states that he died penniless as ‘the net value of such estate is nil’.

Probate documents showed Carson wanted to leave two houses – one each to son Anthony and daughter Majella – in Ireland but that was not possible.

But his will revealed Carson had also been shrewd, leaving a second estate in Spain which covered a third property.

In the 2010 document he said: ‘This does not apply to my property in Spain which is dealt with under the terms of a will made in accordance with the laws of that country.’

Carson grew up in a deprived area of north Belfast known as Little Italy.

The son of a binman, he worked as a plasterer and electrician before joining the Parachute Regiment. He served three years in the Middle East in the 1950s before turning to showbusiness.

Starting his career in pubs and clubs, Carson became famous after winning the ITV talent show Opportunity Knocks.

He lived in Blackpool with his wife Ruth and had been ill with heart problems for five years before his death.

He also carried out endless charity work leading to him being made a Knight of St Gregory by Pope John Paul II in 1987, one of the highest honours in the Catholic Church.

His charity work included helping to raise £130,000 for the children’s cancer ward at Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.
