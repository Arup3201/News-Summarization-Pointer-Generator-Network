At this time of year, you might expect Santa to welcome any attempt to lighten his load.

But Father Christmas has walked out of one of Britain’s busiest grottos – complaining that children did not get enough time to tell him their wishes.

The man behind the white beard, Mike Daviot, also accused organisers in Edinburgh of overcharging for a ‘tacky and disappointing’ experience in which political correctness put a stop to the time-honoured tradition of sitting on Santa’s knee.

Hanging his hat up: Mike Daviot, 55, resigned from his job as Santa at a
 grotto in Edinburgh amid complaints he was grumpy with the children - 
but he says he was spied on by elves

Yesterday, the Mr Daviot said he had quit in protest at his ‘bland and formulaic’ script and time constraints, saying: ‘It’s nothing more than a cattle-herding exercise to keep the visits as short as possible so they can get as many people through the door as possible and make a lot of money.

‘The kids are only getting about a minute in the grotto and if they ask a question which isn’t in the script you are supposed to ignore them.’

Mr Daviot, 55, resigned after just a week at the attraction in East Princes Street Gardens, where families pay £5 per child to visit Santa’s grotto.

He admitted breaking the rules by deviating from the set text and allowing some infants to sit on his knee, which earned him a formal warning from organisers Underbelly.

Mr Daviot, who was one of three Santas working shifts at the grotto, said: ‘All of the advertising said children would get to sit on Santa’s knee.

'That leaves Santa in the incredibly difficult position of trying to explain nicely that they can’t.

‘I eventually came to this decision that very young children – under a year old – could sit on my knee at the parents’ request.’

In a letter to the Scotsman
 explaining his decision to resign, Mr Daviot added: 'I quickly 
discovered to my cost that digressions from the bland, formulaic script 
were being reported to management by the female elves working as Santa’s
 helpers.

'We were, in fact, being spied on.'

The actor, who lives in Edinburgh, also complained there were no lavatories for staff and nowhere to store personal belongings.

A spokesman for Underbelly insisted the time spent in their grotto ‘compared favourably’ with others and said it had been hoped that children could sit on Santa’s lap, but organisers had been advised against it by a child protection expert.

A spokesman for Underbelly said: 'Unfortunately, Mr Daviot was a Bad Santa who decided to leave Edinburgh’s Christmas of his own accord on 13 December.

'However, if he had continued to flout the guidelines, he would have been dismissed and sent back to Lapland.

'He
 was given a formal warning on 12 December for contravening company 
guidelines for allowing children to sit on his knee, before choosing to 
resign.

'We were very disappointed by this but we were right to act on the experts' advice.'

He added: ‘On a more positive note, a 
new Santa has just arrived all the way from Lapland and is happily 
settling into his new grotto.’

One grotto worker said: 'He was a really grumpy Santa. Everyone loves the job, but he seemed to hate it.

 'He didn't get on with anyone, even the elves, and was very brusque with the children and their parents.

 'He would interrupt the children, saying: "I'm talking now"'

'He didn’t get on with anyone - even the elves. He was very brusque with the children and their parents and would interrupt children, saying "I’m talking now".

'It’s funny that he’s complaining about the children not having enough time with him - he couldn’t wait to get them out of the grotto.'

Mr Daviot insisted he had not been grumpy with the children, saying: 'Quite the opposite - and that's what the fuss was about.

'I was actually making an effort to interact with the children rather than just sticking to anunbelievably bland script.

'I became grumpy with the way the whole thing was being run but I wasn't grumpy with the children.'

Parents have complained about the presents their children received, with some saying gifts including a bouncing ball and a paint-by-numbers book did not represent good value for their £5.
