Missed chance: Joe Lewis, 59, walked into a police station after apparently receiving death threats

Detectives missed a chance to arrest a currency trader wanted over an alleged £130million fraud, it has emerged.

Joe Lewis, 59, walked into a police station earlier this month after apparently receiving death threats in the wake of telling clients his business had gone bust.

But he has since vanished, leaving scores of angry investors – rumoured to include professional footballers and golfers – fearful they have lost all their money.

The British businessman sent them an email on December 3 warning they would not receive any more payments because his company had stopped operating.

He admitted his company stopped trading foreign currency in 2009 after suffering 'substantial losses' – but he continued taking investors' cash for the next five years.

It is thought he may have used the new money to pay 'profits' to existing clients in a form of Ponzi scheme.

Three days after sending the email, Mr Lewis walked into a Humberside police station.

He told officers he had received death threats over the collapse of his investment business, according to one investor.

But he was allowed to walk away because police were still deciding whether it was 'suitable' to make any arrests in the alleged fraud case.

Mr Lewis is rumoured to have fled to Thailand, where he has business interests.

Hull-born father-of-two Mr Lewis started his company JL Trading about a decade ago.

The businessman's JL Trading website had a message yesterday saying it is 'no longer trading' (above)

At its peak he employed about 30 staff in Istanbul. More than 800 people, most of them British, are thought to have invested money in his schemes. 

Many investors, some of whom are in their 70s and 80s, are facing financial ruin after handing over their life savings. 

One 57-year-old man who invested £570,000 in November 2012 fears he may only get £10,000 of the money back.

The investor, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It’s all my retirement savings, every penny of it. I‘ve lost nearly half my net worth. I’m not bankrupt but I’m desperate.

‘Obviously my life is completely changed in view of what’s happened.

The whereabouts of Joe Lewis, who traded from a luxury apartment overlooking the Bosphorus in Istanbul (pictured), is currently unknown after he apparently fled the Turkish city. He has not been heard from since

‘There are other people who are in their mid-70s, and they have been left with literally nothing.’

A Humberside Police spokesman said: ‘On Saturday December 6, 2014, a 59-year-old East Yorkshire man voluntarily assisted the police with an investigation into alleged fraud offences.

‘When he left the police station the case was still being assessed for suitability of arrest. 

‘Humberside Police are currently working with City of London Police Serious Fraud Office in connection with the alleged offences.’
