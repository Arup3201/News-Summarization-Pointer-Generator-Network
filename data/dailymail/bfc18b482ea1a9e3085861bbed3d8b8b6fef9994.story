Casey Anthony is considering using a number of disguises ahead of her release from prison on Sunday.

A source close to the Anthony 'team' said she was considering using various disguises to easily and 'realistically' alter her appearance.

The source added she had dismissed the idea of plastic surgery, but will live in a secret location under a new name.

Speaking to The Chicago Sun Times, 
the source said: 'There even have been discussions about cosmetic 
surgery, but Casey has rejected that out of hand.

'Casey really does not completely understand the depth of hatred out there.

'She’s fully aware of the various death threats, of course, but she thinks that’s isolated to relatively few nutcases.'

The source added they were deeply worried for Anthony’s well-being.

Suspicious: Jurors believed George Anthony could
be covering up a crime or even be a killer himself, the jury foreman in
the trial said in an interview

The secret location where she will live is known to a handful of people, according to the source.

She is expected to adopt a pseudonym and live 'almost as if she were in a witness protection-like program' to avoid detection they added.

The source added Anthony is also fielding a large number of publishing, TV and film offers, despite many people swearing they would never buy or watch anything by her.

The news comes after it emerged the jury that cleared Anthony 
of murdering her two-year-old daughter were swayed by the suspicious 
nature of her father.

Jurors
believed George Anthony could have been covering up a crime or even be a
killer himself, the jury foreman in the trial revealed to Fox News.

The foreman, who asked not to be named, said the weeks-long murder trial in Orlando was a period he would 'never forget.'
