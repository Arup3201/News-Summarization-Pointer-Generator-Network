On a bright evening in Iceland’s capital city, this was a game of notable firsts for Celtic.

Ronny Deila’s competitive debut as manager ended in a narrow first leg victory over KR Reykjavik. The Norwegian’s side will surely advance to the third qualifying round of the Champions League after Callum McGregor ended his first start for the Parkhead first team with the winning goal seven minutes from time.

In an Icelandic summer, even the night-time feels luminous. Deila could see clearly, then, that some hard work lies ahead.

In the modest, underwhelming, junior 
park surroundings of the 1,700 capacity KR-vollur Stadium, the Scottish 
champions showed wastefulness before goal. They were slow to warm to 
their task.

They did find 
some urgency in the second half and began to pepper the goal of the 
Icelandic champions — but the game really ought to have been safe long 
before young McGregor justified his inclusion after an impressive season
 on loan at Notts County by claiming a deflected late winner.

The
 Parkhead side struck the crossbar twice through Kris Commons and Leigh 
Griffiths. The former Hibs and Wolves men had started the night on the 
right of an attacking midfield, with McGregor on the left. They 
occasionally resembled square pegs in round holes.

Essentially
 a central midfielder, however, McGregor had switched to the right flank
 when he cut inside in 83 minutes, beat two men and struck a low, 
deflected shot inside the left-hand post of the stranded home keeper 
Stefan Magnusson.

The 
goal marked a memorable night for a 21-year-old who scored 14 goals in 
35 starts in England’s League One last season. He went some way here to 
taking an opportunity presented as much by a lack of options as anything
 else.

Georgios Samaras 
has gone. Derk Boerrigter could have scored as a late substitute here, 
but wasn’t trusted enough to start. Scott Brown is injured. So is James 
Forrest. This is a squad which, on the evidence of this first-leg, 
second-round qualifying tie, needs help. And it needs it quickly if they
 are to reach the promised land of the Champions League group stage for a
 third successive season.

Deila
 gave an inkling of how he wants to play with a 4-2-3-1 formation 
featuring Charlie Mulgrew and Stefan Johansen as deep lying midfielders.
 It’s debatable if Celtic really needed that level of insurance against a
 team of Icelandic part-timers.

It
 left an isolated Anthony Stokes playing up front with Commons, 
Griffiths and McGregor behind. The formation mirrored Gordon Strachan’s 
Scotland with one key difference. Strachan has the players to do it. 
Right now, Deila doesn’t

Nevertheless,
 the reign almost got off to the kind of sublime start which would have 
rendered McGregor’s late counter academic. Commons, the player of the 
year and the scorer of 32 goals last season, started as if he meant 
business. As if he planned simply to take up where he left off before.

In
 the ninth minute, he ended some neat work by Griffiths by thumping a 
looping 25-yard left-foot volley on to the top of the crossbar.

He
 was at it again two minutes later, smashing another long-range effort 
towards the top corner with his left foot. KR keeper Magnusson pushed it
 round the post, but he looked none too convincing.

After 10 minutes, this looked a walk in the park for Celtic. A public park, indeed.

Maybe
 they even began to think that themselves. Because for all the 
possession and dominance of the first half, there was a predictability 
and pedestrian aspect to Celtic’s play in the opening half.

In
 their black and white vertical shirts, KR Reykjavik were no Juventus. 
Gonzalo Balbi, brother-in-law of Uruguyan superstar Luis Suarez, offered
 a slither of intrigue. But, like his team-mates, he offered precious 
little else.

English 
striker Gary Martin smashed a low right-foot shot from 25 yards, which 
was gathered low by Fraser Forster. Yet Celtic’s keeper saw as much 
action here as he did in Brazil when he was an unused squad member in 
England’s World Cup squad.

Shot at glory: Kris Commons unleashes a fierce effort at goal

The
 mild concern for Celtic was this. Magnusson, at the other end, was 
hardly run off his feet until the latter stages of the game, either.

Commons,
 the one true player of invention and craft Celtic have, was locked in a
 personal war of attrition with the KR keeper, beginning a second period
 of more tempo and urgency much as he did the first.

Within
 minutes of the restart, the former Scotland international had three 
decent chances to score. He could easily have had another of the 
hat-tricks which pockmarked last season’s remarkable campaign.

The first two were rising right-foot shots which soared over the bar from just inside the area.

Perhaps
 his best chance of all came in 54 minutes. A neat one-two with Stokes 
ended in the Irishman advancing on the left side of the box and squaring
 a low ball for the former Derby player to sidefoot towards goal. The 
effort lacked pace and conviction and allowed Magnusson to fall low to 
his left to clutch gratefully. But Celtic were coming closer.

Not what they're used to: Celtic's team line up in front of a modest attendance in Reykjavik

They
 struck the crossbar for the second time of the match when Griffiths was
 deeply unfortunate to see his ferocious left-foot strike, after cutting
 in from the side, rebound off the face of the upright.

It was still shaking when the Scotland striker made way for Boeriggter in 73 minutes, Teemu Pukki replacing Stokes.

The
 substitutes should have conjured the long-awaited opening goal within 
minutes of their arrival. Boerrigter brought out a close-range double 
save from Magnusson before the ball broke kindly for Pukki.

The
 Finn really ought to have buried the rebound but dragged the ball too 
wide with a poor touch and fired his angled shot against the outside of 
the post.

It was an 
embarrassing miss which threatened to tee up a mildly embarrassing 
scoreless draw. For Celtic, it looked one of those nights. McGregor’s 
debut to remember changed all that.
