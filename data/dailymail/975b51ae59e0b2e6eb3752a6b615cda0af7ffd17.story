Gregg Steinhafel, who stepped down from his position as President and CEO of Target earlier this month in the wake of last year's data breach and the company's shaky Canadian expansion, will receive an estimated $15.9million in his severance package.

Target released the numbers in its annual proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.

Fired: Ex-Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel, pictured, will receive a severance package worth an estimated $15.9million

Steinhafel will receive $7.2million in severance payments and nearly $10million from an 'officer deferred compensation plan' Target froze in 1996. Steinhafel was eligible because he joined the company in 1979. The severance package also includes nearly $4million in stock.

Despite these amounts, Steinhafel will have to pay back $5.4million in retirement benefits. The package is worth an estimated $15.9million.

The package's exact amount will be based on interest rates and Target's stock price on May 5, Steinhafel's last day on the job, according to the filing.

Steinhafel's exit was listed in the proxy statement as 'an involuntary termination for reasons other than for cause.'

Unhappy: Stockholder feedback said Steinhafel's pay 'was too high given Target's performance to peers'

Steinhafel's total compensation was also cut by about a third. This year, Steinhafel received $12.9million in total compensation - considerably less than the $20.6million he received in 2012. His base salary was $1.5million for both years.

Shareholders
 felt that 'overall pay for our former CEO was too high given Target's 
performance relative to peers,' the company said in the proxy.

Steinhafel will continue to receive his full CEO salary and benefits through August 23, while he works as a company advisor during its transition period.

Meanwhile, interim president and CEO John Mulligan's salary will increase on May 22 from $700,000 to $1million and he will receive a one-time grant of restricted stock units.
