It began as a sketch on YouTube charting the plight of a Welshman trying to make it as a band manager in London.

Initially funded by a redundancy payment by writer and star Jonny Owen, it became a viral hit.

As plans to turn it into a film took shape, life began to imitate art - and just as the fictional band became a hit, the sketch has been turned into a film set to be released around the world.

The Premature Congratulations, the fictional band in the film. They were taught how to act like a band by Libertines frontman Carl Barat.

Now the film received has its London premiere - and is tipped to become a summer smash after Hollywood giant Universal agreed to distribute it with Munro films.

It began life in 2009, when Jonny Owen has made redundant from his job in Wales and decided to move to London.

'I had £4,000 in redundancy, so moved to London with big plans - and ran out of money 2 weeks later,' he told MailOnline.

'Me and Roger Evans (who plays Owen's best friend Horsey in the film) had an idea, about this Welsh guy who came to London, his best friend was a record company boss.'

The pair filmed the sketch in Soho, and uploaded it to YouTube. 

After an article appearing in the Evening Standard newspaper in London, it began to spread online.

'Loads of industry people wanted to get involved, including Alan McGee, Carl Barat and Martin Freeman,' said Owen.

The pair then created a series of six episodes on a shoestring budget.

'I got a call from Martin Root, who wanted to set up a film company to make it into as movie, and he raised the money to do that.

'It was really a case of life imitating art - I was playing this guy knocking on doors in the film, and was doing the same in real life trying to get the film made.'

The film soon attracted major interest, and British stars Vicky McClure and Martin Freeman agreed to appear in it.

‘A friend of mine told me about Svengali after about the third episode,' said Freeman.

'When he’d described it I was actually annoyed that I hadn’t been asked to do it.

'I went home, watched the lot, and knew I was right to be annoyed. It was charming, sussed and very funny.’

Once completed, the film was picked up by Universal, and is set for release and download on the 21st - and has already been sold in France, with plans to release it in the US underway.

'I've no idea where it will end,' admitted Owen.

'I just wanted to make a movie people will watch.'
