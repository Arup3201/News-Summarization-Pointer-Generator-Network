A judicial review application submitted by Australian convicted drug traffickers Andrew Chan and Myruan Sukumaran could lead to a window of opportunity for the pair who have been sentenced to execution.

Despite the Indonesian Attorney General's former claims that the appeal would be rejected on Tuesday due to there being only one exhausted entitlement for judicial review, the Denpasar District Court chief, Judge Sugeng Riyono, is yet to make a decision on the matter.

'There is no difficulty. We just have to look at all the regulations, including the Constitutional Court decision, the Supreme Court decree as well as the joint decision that was made in January,' Mr Riyono said on Tuesday, rather than dismissing the appeal, News Corp reports.

Chan and Sukumaran's lawyer, Julian McMahon, argued that his clients had clearly exhibited that they had been rehabilitated since their sentencing in 2006.

'Anyone who studies the facts in the case of Sukumaran and Chan would immediately know they should not be treated as if they are merely criminals. In fact because of the Indonesian penal system they have become reformed prisoners and valuable contributors helping Indonesia. It simply makes no sense now to kill them,' Mr McMahon told News Corp.

The sliver of hope comes after it was revealed on Monday that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions.

The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. 

'There is no difficulty. We just have to look at all the regulations, including the Constitutional Court decision, the Supreme Court decree as well as the joint decision that was made in January,' Mr Riyono said on Tuesday, rather than dismissing the appeal

According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap.

The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan.

From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island, where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners. 

Nusa Kambangan is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago.

Meanwhile appeals for the two men's lives continue to be made, the latest of which has come from a British band known as one of the Indonesian President's favourites.

Napalm Death's lead singer Mark 'Barney' Greenway penned a letter to Joko Widodo asking him to grant clemency to the convicted drug traffickers 

Napalm Death's lead singer Mark 'Barney' Greenway penned a letter to Joko Widodo asking him to grant clemency to the convicted drug traffickers and posting the open letter  to the band's Facebook page last month, for their 729,000 followers to read.

Mr Widodo is said to be a big fan of metal, and recently revealed in an interview that he discovered the genre when he stumbled across a thrash metal band gig when he was just 14 years old. 

'I am appealing directly to you to please spare the lives of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the two Australian citizens who are currently awaiting the death sentence in Indonesia for heroin smuggling,' the letter began. 

'As a follower of our band Napalm Death, you would appreciate that our lyrics and ethos challenge the unbroken cycle of violence in the world, whether it comes from a state or as an individual.

Dear Mr Widodo,  

I am appealing directly to you to please spare the lives of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the two Australian citizens who are currently awaiting the death sentence in Indonesia for heroin smuggling. 

As a follower of our band Napalm Death, you would appreciate that our lyrics and ethos challenge the unbroken cycle of violence in the world, whether it comes from a state or as an individual. If these things are not challenged and ultimately changed, I believe we will never truly move forward as humankind.

I understand that you are standing as a leader determined to change things for the better, and so I believe granting clemency would be a major step forward in this pursuit of betterment. 

I appreciate that heroin can be damaging on many levels, but I believe that this is a much deeper issue that cannot be changed or altered by simply taking away the lives of people. 

Again, I respectfully ask that you make a real difference and overturn these sentences.

In hope and peace,

Mark 'Barney' Greenway (Napalm Death)

'If these things are not challenged and ultimately changed, I believe we will never truly move forward as humankind,' the post continued. 

Joko Widodo has been pictured posing while wearing a Napalm Death t-shirt on multiple occasions, and is reportedly a big fan of other heavy metal bands such as Metallica, Megadeath and Lamb of God. 

He is also known for his hardline approach to issues such as drug trafficking, selling his election campaign - in part - on tougher penalties for criminals.

Napalm Death is a band credited with defining the grindcore genre - an amalgamation of elements from hardcore death and punk metal.

They also hold a Guinness World Record for the world's shortest song - titled You Suffer with a duration of 1.316 seconds.
