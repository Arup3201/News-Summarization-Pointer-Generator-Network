A snap-happy astronaut captured this incredible shot of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge from his perch hundreds of miles above the earth on board the International Space Station.

Commander Chris Hadfield, 53, has posted hundreds of breathtaking images on his Twitter account since joining the crew as part of Expedition 34 just a few weeks ago.

As well as San Francisco's famous landmark, Commander Hadfield - who has described the shifting view of the earth from windows of the space station as 'a perpetual magnet' - has snapped the bright lights of Manhattan at night, the 'endless' golden beaches of Australia, a vivid blue river snaking through Brazilian farmland, and 'cauliflower' clouds sitting over the Amazon rainforest.

Commander Hadfield joined the International Space Station on December 21 at the start of a five month spell on board the satellite in low earth orbit.

In March the flight engineer will become the first Canadian to take control of the giant orbiting laboratory.

The prolific snapper told his some 280,000 Twitter followers the view from his new office was simply 'too wondrous to ignore', and has shared shot after shot of desert landscapes, sprawling cities, African lakes and Caribbean islands.

Commander Hadfield has also uploaded views of flood-hit Queensland, Australia, and the United States from east to west, as well as an image of the glowing lights of Quebec city in his native Canada.
