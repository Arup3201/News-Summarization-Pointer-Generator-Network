The locals swear it is the good sea air that keeps them healthy.

But whatever the reason, the picturesque town of Christchurch in Dorset is today named as the pensioner capital of Britain.

Nearly one in three of those living in the coastal town is retired, double the national average. The town of 47,750 has nearly 14,200 pensioners – 29.7 per cent – a report published today shows.

Scenic: Christchurch has the highest percentage of pensioners of any town in Britain

And, according to separate data from the Office of National Statistics, this figure will rise to nearly 37.9 per cent by 2031.

Residents say the town, with its mild climate, 11th century castle and large natural harbour,  is driven by an army of active  over-65s who keep a vibrant cultural community running.

The report, compiled by the Prudential and based on analysis of 2011 census figures, show Tower Hamlets in London has the lowest proportiTon of retirees in the UK, with just one in 16 (6 per cent).

The South West, with its beaches and countryside, was found to be the most popular region for retirees generally, with a fifth of the population of pension age.

Other areas listed as grey hotspots include West Somerset, in second place, North Norfolk in third, and Rother in East Sussex in fourth.

The Prudential report showed London is the least popular region for retirees. Only around one in nine (11 per cent) of those living in the capital are pensioners.

Vince Smith-Hughes, retirement expert at Prudential, said: ‘Perhaps unsurprisingly, there’s a tendency for people to move out to the country when they stop working, where property prices can be lower and the quality of life is often thought to be higher.

‘However, people planning to stop working shouldn’t assume that a move to the country is the simple answer to a comfortable retirement, as the cost of living in these hot spots can be surprisingly high.’

Almost half of homes currently listed for sale in Christchurch have a price tag of at least £300,000.

Last year, a beach hut in the area sold for £170,000 two days after going on the market.

Overall, over 65s now make up nearly a sixth of the British population.

There are 900,000 more over 65s than there were a decade ago, highlighting just how big the challenge Britain faces in caring for our elderly.

An estimated 16.4 per cent of the population, or 9,223,000 people, are over 65 as the post-war baby boomers reach their twilight years and life expectancy continues to rise.

Despite concerns over the rising cost of care, research suggests pensioners are richer than at any time in the past 15 years.

The Institute for Fiscal Studies found last year that pensioner incomes have risen by 29.4 per cent since 1999 compared with just 26 per cent for working people.
