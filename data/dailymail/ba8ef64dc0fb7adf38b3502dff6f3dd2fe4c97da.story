If you're low on time but have a good cash flow, this spectacular tour by private jet could be the best way to see the world's most iconic attractions - and it takes just 25 days.

But at a cost of £53,000, it's certainly not for everyone..

The pricey whistle-stop tour takes in some of the finest architectural, historical and geographical locations in existence, including the Great Wall of China, wildlife in the Serengeti, and art in St Petersburg.

Iconic: The flight from Tokyo to China allows visitors to spend time at the iconic Great Wall as well as Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City

White sand experience: After China, the jet heads to the Maldives, arriving on the island of Malé for travellers to spot a wide variety of sealife in the crystalline waters

The tour begins on August 30 in Seattle, the Emerald City, next stop Tokyo

The Global Icons Private Jet Tour - on a 
VIP Boeing 757 - takes in eight countries around the world with just 
enough time to get a 'feel' for some of the most globally iconic spots 
along the way.

TCS Expeditions, through Hurlingham 
Travel, is offering the 25-day trip which takes in various iconic 
locations in eight countries - with guests staying exclusively in Four 
Seasons Hotels throughout their trip.

The
 tour begins on August 30 in Seattle, the Emerald City, where you will 
visit Pike Place Market and the site of the original Nordstrom’s 
department store.

From
 Seattle you will board your private jet to Tokyo where you will tour 
the stunning Giza shopping district including flagships for Cartier and 
Chanel.

Here
 you can also take a short train to Kamakura, the former political 
centre, which is also the site of the 44-foot tall Great Buddha. Samurai
 sword fighting lessons are also included.

From
 Tokyo travellers fly next to China to visit Tiananmen Square and the 
Forbidden City, then finish their stay in China with the Great Wall.

The jet will next head over to the Maldives, arriving on the island of Malé where you can take a short boat ride to Kuda Huraa, where more than 700 species of fish and 37 species of shark await in the beautiful waters.

Tokyo dreams: A trip round the iconic spots of Tokyo is followed by a spot of Samurai sword fighting - though not against these ladies hopefully

From the multi-coloured fish of the Malidives to the largest terrestrials in Africa: In Tanzania lions, leopards, cape buffalos, elephants and rhinos will be on the agenda

Yes, it's definitely blue: The Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul is next on the itinerary, with a chance to also wander through the Grand Bazaar and stare at the opulent Topkapi Palace

Hence to 
the Serengeti, Tanzania, where visitors will get the best chance of 
seeing the 'Big Five': lions, leopards, cape buffalos, elephants and 
rhinos.

Istanbul offers the chance to take in the wonders of the Grand Bazaar, the Blue Mosque and the opulent Topkapi Palace.

The
 Russian Museum in St. Petersburg then awaits your arrival, as does the 
vast art collection within the stunning State Hermitage Museum located 
in the Winter Palace.

Then
 it's on to magical and vibrant Marrakech to marvel at its souks, palace
 and mosques; as well as visit the beautiful Atlas Mountains beyond.

The
 world tour ends in Boston, a town steeped in history – Harvard and the 
Freedom Trail are just a few of the locations travellers will visit to 
complete the tour of the travel icons of the world.

A riot of colour awaits in Morocco, where travellers can wander through the souks of Marrakesh travellers also voted as iconic

On reflection: After the bustling souks of Marrakech, a trip to the tranquil Atlas Mountains should be just the ticket

Finishing Stateside: The world tour ends in Boston, a town steeped in history ¿ specifically at Harvard Uiversity, voted as one of the top places to visit

The trip 
was created after research commissioned by TCS and conducted through 
VeryFirstTo, which aimed to establish what people saw as the top global 
travel icons.

The survey heralded the Eiffel Tower as the top world travel icon, followed by the Taj Mahal and Pyramids Of Giza.

Also
 in the top 35 global travel icons included as varied a selection as 
Tiananmen Square in China; the Grand Bazaar in Turkey; the Souks of Marrakech and Harvard University in Boston.

While
 the Eiffel Tower, Taj Mahal and Pyramids are not on the agenda, 
travellers will get a feel for many of the sights voted as 'most iconic'
 as they travel around by private jet.

As if that isn't enough, a team of logistic experts will take care of 
every detail from baggage handling to filling out landing cards.

Also
 on the team is a doctor in case anyone is taken ill during the trip; a 
highly regarded lecturer to impart information on each of the places 
visited, and even - in case you forget your own camera - a top photographer.

The tour, costing an eye-watering £53,500, is limited to 56 guests, and single occupancy carries a £5,340 surcharge.

Best get saving - the trip kicks off at the end of August.
