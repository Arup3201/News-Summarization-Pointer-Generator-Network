Solanke is a pacy striker, whose goals helped the Blues win the FA Youth Cup last season, with consecutive hat-tricks in the competition.

He turned 17 a month ago but has already played for the club’s Under 21s and in the UEFA Youth League.

Solanke has been at the club since 2004. He scored 18 goals leading the line for the academy side last year and his sharpness in front of goal means Jose Mourinho has no qualms in throwing him into the first-team.

He scored the winner for England’s Under 18s against Holland last month and can’t be far away from Gareth Southgate’s Under 21s. 

A word of warning, though: Solanke is eligible to play for Nigeria — his father’s country of birth.
