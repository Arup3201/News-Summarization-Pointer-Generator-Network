This is the dramatic moment an out-of-control car smashed through a reception foyer at 40mph after its driver collapsed at the wheel.

Seconds before the two-tonne Volkswagen Sharan people carrier careens headlong into the building lucky pedestrians can be seen strolling past - oblivious to the impending impact.

One shocked witness said the horrific collision was 'like something out of a Hollywood film'.

Careening out-of-control: The Volkswagen Sharan shows no signs of slowing as it mounts the pavement at around 40mph heading straight for the brick foyer

Violent impact: The unconscious driver is unable to brace for the huge smash as the car heads headlong towards the building

Miraculous escape: The car hurtles through the brick wall and into the reception where only minutes earlier people had been standing

The film shows the car mounting the 
pavement before thundering into the reception area of John Stokes Ltd in
Tipton, West Midlands.

Just minutes before the crash, business owner Dene Stokes, 59, had been standing in the reception area with a client.

The vehicle is seen tearing through bricks and windows before coming to an abrupt halt by when it collided with a metal safe. 

Incredibly, no one was hurt in the incident which happened just before 1pm on Tuesday.

Metal worker Frank Knight, 50, who saw
the crash, said: ‘I saw him smash through the window at what must have 
been over 40mph - it didn't seem real.

‘It was more like something out of a Hollywood film - the guy is incredibly lucky to walk away from that.

Demolition: Cameras inside the foyer captured the moment the car completely obliterates a sofa which miraculously no one was sitting on at 1pm on Tuesday

Obliteration: The two-tonne Volkswagen Sharan punches straight through the brick front wall of metal components firm John Stokes Ltd in Tipton, West Midlands - smashing it to smithereens

A crowd of panicked onlookers rush 
towards the car after the crash in a bid to help the driver - who 
incredibly walked away with only minor injuries.

Mr
Stoke's son Tom, managing director of the chrome plating firm, said the
reception area had only undergone a £25,000 refurbishment last month.

He said: ‘I was on the phone to my father at the time and I kept him talking longer than usual.

‘It was lucky that I did because he would have been back in reception if I hadn't have called.

‘Just
minutes earlier he had been standing there with a client - it doesn't 
bare thinking about what could've happened if he was sitting on that 
sofa.

‘Everyone is assuming
he has just passed out at the wheel - it looks like he has gone in at 
40 or 50mph in a completely straight line with no attempt to break or 
swerve. 

Horror: Shocked pedestrians rush to the scene of the accident

Aftermath: Shocked onlookers race to the crash site and struggle into dusty wreckage of the building to see if anyone needs help

‘We have a five-ton metal safe in the building, and it looks like that's what stopped him.’

A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: ‘Police were called by the ambulance service just after 1.08pm.

‘Officers attended to reports a car had been in collision with a building.

‘One man was treated in hospital for minor injuries.

‘After initial enquiries it is believed the man may be have been taken ill prior to the collision.
