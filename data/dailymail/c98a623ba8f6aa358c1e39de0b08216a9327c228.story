The Glazer family were welcomed at Manchester United by burning effigies and mass fan protest.

But that has not stopped them largely overseeing a spell of success on the pitch at Old Trafford until last season's setback.

David Moyes endured a nightmare 10 months before being sacked in April but, with serial winner Louis van Gaal now installed as replacement, United have one of Europe's most respected managers at the helm as they bid to recapture the glory days of Sir Alex Ferguson's time.

Executive vice chairman Ed Woodward has vowed to help get the club back on track after last season's seventh place finish, with Van Gaal expected to revitalise an ageing squad by spending big this summer.

CONTROVERSIAL TAKEOVER

The Glazer family, led by father Malcolm, began their pursuit of United in 2003 and completed a £790million takeover in May 2005.

But it was met with huge opposition from fans and the deal went through to the backdrop of supporter protests after debt used to buy the club was put back on its balance sheet in what is known as a leveraged buyout.

Around 2,000 fans swarmed around Old Trafford when the news was announced, burning effigies of Glazer Snr and season ticket forms, holding placards saying 'Not for $al£' and there was even a sit-down protest, blocking a main road to the stadium.

Five men were arrested and two were charged with public order offences.

A fan pressure group, Shareholders United, was set up a year previously in an attempt to block the Glazer family takeover.

Chairman Nick Towle said at the time: 'I am very sad - I still love the club but I refuse to put a penny into the company. And I believe as many as 20,000 fans may also leave Man United.'

Their attempts were futile and disaffected fans set up a new club FC United of Manchester, now in the seventh tier of English football.

RUNNING OF THE CLUB

In April 2006, only a year after the purchase was complete, Malcolm Glazer suffered a stroke and the day-to-day running of the club was handed to two of his sons, Joel and Avram.

Glazer Snr never visited Old Trafford once to watch the side in the entire time his family have been in charge.

He had virtually nothing to do with running the club since the very beginning, and his six children – Joel, Avram, Bryan, Kevin, Edward and Darcie Glazer-Kassewitz – have had ownership of the family's 90 per cent stake of club, with the other 10 per cent listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

SUCCESS ON THE FIELD

Despite the family's unpopularity, space on the shelf in the United trophy cabinet has been steadily running out.

In the nine years since they have been at the helm, the club have won 10 major trophies.

Five League titles – including three in a row between 2006 and 2009 – a Champions League, three League Cups and the Club World Cup.

Until last season's disastrous spell under Moyes, when they ended the season in seventh, they have not finished outside the top two in the Glazers' tenure, coming second the other three times.

The first campaign under their ownership was slow. United crashed out of the Champions League in the first round, bottom of their group.

They came second in the Barclays Premier League, but didn't end the season empty-handed, picking up the League Cup.

Their first league win came in the second season, and they also got to the semi-final of the Champions League and were runners up in the FA Cup.

Two trophies followed the next season, in 2007-08. They won back-to-back league titles and Champions League.

More followed the next year in one of the most competitive campaigns in the club's history, fighting for silverware on seven fronts.

They won a third successive league title, the League Cup and Club World Cup, they were runners up in the Champions League and Super Cup, and were FA Cup semi-finalists.

In the next four seasons United won the league twice and the League Cup, before Moyes took charge.

THE TRANSFERS

The then world record sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80million in July 2009 is the most notable transfer in the Glazer family reign.

But when it comes to transfers they have hardly been the guy who miraculously can't find his wallet when it's their round.

United famously pinched Robin van Persie from rivals Arsenal for £24m in 2012. Dimitar Berbatov came for £30.75m in 2008 and left for £5m four years later.

That was a club record until the purchase of Juan Mata from Chelsea for £37.1m in January, while they also shelled out £27.5m for Marouane Fellaini last season.

They have welcomed Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra, Edwin van Der Sar and David de Gea.

Michael Owen, long-admired by Sir Alex Ferguson, joined the club, although he continued the lacklustre end to his career. The infamous Bebe was brought in for £7.4m in 2010 and is somehow still a United player.

Bar the sale of Ronaldo, the Glazers have not been known to let their best players be taken by domestic and european rivals.

Ageing stars Roy Keane, admittedly a shock departure in 2005, Phil Neville and Ruud van Nistelrooy were allowed to go.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes all retired. Scholes even came back and retired again.

One oversight was allowing Gerard Pique to leave for Barcelona, where he has since gone on to become one of the world's best defenders.

Carlos Tevez joined the club on loan in 2007 but left to controversially sign for local rivals Manchester City two years later.

Big mistake: United allowed Gerard Pique to return to Barcelona for just £4million in 2008

MANAGERIAL MISTAKE

Perhaps the biggest error of the Glazers' ownership has been to allow Ferguson to appoint his own successor.

Although it is understandable why they put faith in the greatest manager in the game's history to have a keen eye for who should follow him.

Moyes's 10 months in charge were nothing short of catastrophic.

Nightmare: David Moyes was sacked in April after a disastrous first season in charge at United

It is unlikely he would boast about it, but the Scot did win the Community Shield in his first competitive fixture in charge.

But exits in the quarter-final of the Champions League, semi-final of the League Cup and third round of the FA Cup and struggling even to make the Europa League proved too much for the Glazers to take.

United are not exactly sinking yet, but they have certainly taken on some heavy water and the American owners will be hoping that tough taskmaster Van Gaal will be able to steady the ship.
