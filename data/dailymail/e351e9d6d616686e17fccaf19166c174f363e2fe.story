'Peter earned everything he got and he deserves his shot on 'SNL,' Sorrentino said.

Pete was aged seven when his father Scott was killed as he climbed the steps to help the guests of the Marriott World Trade Center Hotel.

Scott, aged 33, when he died was assigned to Ladder Co. 118 in Brooklyn Heights, which responded to the Trade Center site after the second hijacked airliner struck.

'When they arrived on the scene, they parked their rig at West and Vesey streets, then vanished into the thick, cloudy smoke and soot,' said his father in an interview at the time reports Silive.

'It is believed they were on the 15th floor in the north tower, on the way up, when the building collapsed. 

'Only their truck was recovered and has been restored and put back in service.' 

'Can't believe it's been 13 years. Feels like it was just yesterday. Words can't express how much I miss you,' Pete, who live in Brooklyn, tweeted this month.

Davidson is almost the youngest SNL cast member in history, following 1980s stars Anthony Michael Hall, who came in at 16, and Eddie Murphy, who joined at 19. 

He has previously been seen on MTV's Guy Code, Wild 'N Out, and Jimmy Kimmel Live.
