Unconventional diet: Mike Snell has lost over ten stone by eating curry for breakfast every morning 

A father has lost more than ten stone in less than a year with an unconventional diet that includes curries for breakfast every morning.

Mike Snell, 38, from Chester, invented his own unique diet that involved wolfing down a vindaloo every morning at 6am.

The meal plan has led to him going from 24st to 13st 13lbs in just 11 months.

The delivery driver's eating habits became similar to those recommended on the fast diet - as he would gorge on his favourite foods until 10am but then eat little else all day.

Mike would always start with a hearty helping of vindaloo to fire up his metabolism and then ate anything else he fancied, which satisfied his cravings for the day.

He would then just have a light snack such as a bowl of soup in the evening.

The bizarre approach to dieting has worked wonders for Mike who is now slimmer than he's ever been. 

He had piled on the pounds thanks to his job as constantly being on the move making deliveries meant the father-of-two had to grab whatever he could to eat.

As a result, he used to gorge on cakes and chocolates while making deliveries to supermarkets. He would also stop off at burger vans between rounds and stock up on bacon butties and other fatty meals.

It was in January this year that Mike finally decided to make a change when a colleague commented on how out of breath he was after hitching up his trailer.

So Mike devised his own way of going about dieting as he found traditional approaches were not effective.  

He said: 'I wanted to go about dieting a different way to how you would expect. The problem for me is that if someone tells me I can't eat something I just want to eat it even more.

'So I decided I wanted to do a diet that would mean I could eat whatever I wanted.

As he was: Mike put on weight as he used to snack on cakes and chocolates and stop at burger vans for lunch as he worked as a delivery driver

Now: Mike starts his day with a vindaloo at 6am everyday but says he keeps his diet interesting by adding different ingredients to his favourite Indian dish

'The point of eating at six in the morning is that it takes away the cravings for the rest of the day.

'I carried on eating the same things, so lots of carbs and sugars, until 10am.'

Despite the consistency of his diet Mike says he is not yet bored of curry and has found ways of keeping his meals exciting. 

'I have a chicken vindaloo every morning. I have it a bit differently everyday to keep it interesting.

'I'll have salad with baby leaves one day and others I'll add broccoli or tinned veg.'

Amazingly, Mike has not undertaken any extra exercise and says his incredible weight loss is down to diet alone. 

Mike is thrilled with his impressive weight loss but says his girlfriend was happier when he was larger

As well as his physical change, Mike says that since his weight loss he has a far more positive demeanor. 

'In recent months clothes shopping has been amazing, I feel like I have finally been able to work out what kind of person I am,' he said. 'I also find that when I am out and about people start talking to me that wouldn't have before and also the other way around - I'm not worried about approaching other people as well.'

He added: 'I'm so much happier now. My daughters think I'm a completely different man. They love taking me shopping now.'

However, not everyone is completely happy with his transformation.

'It took my girlfriend a while to get used to it. I was 23 stone when she met me.

'She finds it weird - she says I'm not the same man that I used to be. She's not happy with me!'
