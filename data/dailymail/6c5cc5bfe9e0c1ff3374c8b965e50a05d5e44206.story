Bae Sang-Moon will enter the final day of the Frys.com Open with a four-shot lead after an excellent seven-under-par 65 in his third round in California.

The South Korean made a sensational start to his round with five consecutive birdies from the second and although he dropped a couple of shots on the seventh and 13th, he went birdie-par-eagle-birdie on his final four holes.

'Four-shot lead makes me a little comfortable for Sunday, but I don't think about a win,' Sang-Moon said on the PGA Tour website.

Bae, whose only victory on the PGA Tour came last May at the HP Byron Nelson Championship, held his nerve in the closing stages to hole a couple of clutch putts.

A magnificent 15-footer on the last took him to 16-under for the tournament, which gives him a comfortable cushion over nearest challenger Zachary Blair.

The American, who only earned his Tour card three weeks ago, has given himself an outside chance of reeling in Bae after his 69, which featured five birdies and two bogeys.

'It's been a pretty crazy four or five months, but it's been great,' Blair said.

Overnight leader Martin Laird from Scotland fell back among a number of players five shots adrift of Bae following a disappointing 71 on Saturday.

The 31-year-old Glaswegian has taken seven weeks off the Tour and looked to be back with a bang after two 67s in his opening two rounds but he was in patchy form in his third round.

American trio Matt Kuchar, Brooks Koepka and Scott Langley are also on 11-under while compatriot Hunter Mahan, South Africa's Retief Goosen, Japan's Hideki Matsuyama  and Sweden's David Lingmerth are a shot further back.
