Downing Street was forced to overrule the Foreign Secretary last night after he dismissed the prospect of UK air strikes against Islamic extremists in Syria.

Philip Hammond risked opening a rift with Barack Obama after saying Britain would not join US-led strikes against Islamic State fanatics.

Asked about plans for an open-ended bombing campaign, Mr Hammond said: ‘Let me be clear – Britain will not be taking part in any air strikes in Syria. We have already had that discussion in our parliament last year and we won’t be revisiting that position.’ 

But his comments provoked alarm at Number 10, which is anxious to present a united front on the US strategy unveiled by the President on Wednesday.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond today appeared to rule out British air strikes against ISIS in Syria, but David Cameron's official spokesman insisted no options were off the table

Hours after Mr Hammond’s appearance in Germany, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman insisted Mr Cameron was ‘not ruling anything out’. 

He said a decision had not yet been made on whether Britain would join air strikes on IS targets inside Syria, but stressed that the Islamist fanatics had to be tackled both there and in Iraq.

He suggested Mr Hammond had been referring to the idea of bombing the forces of Syrian tyrant Bashar al-Assad – an issue that has not been on the agenda for more than 12 months. 

But it appeared Mr Hammond had accidentally revealed ministers’ deep reservations about joining a hazardous military mission in Syria just months before the General Election.

Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday Mr Hammond said there was a ‘qualitative difference’ between air strikes on IS positions in Iraq and Syria. 

He said Syria’s ‘sophisticated, integrated air defence system (which) protects the whole of the country’s airspace’ greatly increased the risk of operating there.

Battle cry: US President Barack Obama threatened renewed airstrikes against ISIS saying that 'in a region that has known so much bloodshed, these terrorists are unique in their brutality'

Mr Hammond’s caution is a blow to hopes of building a united international response to IS. Last night it emerged ten Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Iraq, have pledged support for a US-led strategy to destroy IS ‘wherever it is, including in both Iraq and Syria’.

Downing Street said Mr Cameron welcomed and supported Mr Obama’s declaration that air strikes will take place inside Syria for the first time alongside an expansion of strikes in Iraq.

Number 10 held open the prospect of the RAF hitting at IS targets in Iraq although officials said that Britain is currently ‘not at the stage’ of joining the military action.

With UK aid worker David Haines, 44, threatened with execution by IS, there are fears that any British participation in air strikes would lead to his death.

During a speech on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Mr Obama promised: ‘We will conduct a systematic campaign of air strikes against these terrorists. I will not hesitate to take action against Isil in Syria, as well as Iraq.’ Military planners are expected to take several weeks to identify targets in Syria and Mr Obama warned of a protracted campaign. US Secretary of State John Kerry was in Saudi Arabia last night to try gauge the level of Middle East support in the fight against IS.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem has told the US that air strikes on its territory without Damascus’ consent would be considered an aggression.
