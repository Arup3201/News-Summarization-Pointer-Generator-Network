Would you like a side of whiskers with that California Roll?

Well, now you can, thanks to a Japanese company who have created a range of prints featuring cats resting on sushi rolls - as well as some bonkers videos to promote their latest product.

These somewhat bizarre sushi-themed felines, known as Neko-Sushi, have been shot by Japanese company Tange & Nakimushi Peanuts for their new advertising campaign and their baffling nature is causing a stir in Japan and worldwide.

Fancy some whiskers with that? Known as Neko-Sushi, they have been shot by Japanese company Tange & Nakimushi Peanuts in their new advertising campaign

The brand seem to have superimposed feline friends onto sushi rolls with some photoshop trickery, and Japanese fans can't get enough of them.

While some of the cats looks relatively cute posing on the seafood and vegetables, some look terrified and some are just plain strange.

And if the sight of a pussycat resting on a square of sushi rice wasn't weird enough, the company claims that Sushi Cats are actually a life-form that goes way back and that have been known to bring people luck in ancient Japanese folk tales.

On their website the company writes: 'Neko-Sushi is an extremely unusual life-form consisting of a cat on top of a portion of sushi rice.

'Although several references have come down to us through history from various researchers and witnesses, their existence is still shrouded in mystery and actual sightings remain rare.'

And cat lovers can be rest assured that no cats were harmed during the shoot, and it was all conducted under the guidance of professional animal handlers, according to the brand's video.
