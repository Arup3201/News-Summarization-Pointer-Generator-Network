When identical twin sisters Darlene and Diane Nettemeier went to a twins' festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, one man stood out by himself amongst the sea of twins.

Tall, dark and handsome Mark Sanders caught their eye, but there was only one of him and two of them.

Luckily for them, Mr Sanders was also a twin, and he called his identical brother, Craig, down from their hotel room to meet the 'neat' blondes.

Instant attraction: The twins (Craig and Diane are left) said they fell for each other immediately when they met in Twinsburg, Ohio

Soon afterwards, the pairs of twins fell in love, got married, and then went on to produce another set of identical twins.

Now the Sanders family - Craig and Diane, and Mark and Darlene - live in houses next door to each other in Texas, and have five children between them.

Today they appeared on a U.S. talk show to discuss talk about their unusual family set-up.

Craig, 44, said that he felt an 'instant attraction' to just one of the blonde twins, Darlene, despite them looking the same.

Fateful day: The twins when they met at Twin Day festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, in 1998

Double dating: The two sets of twins both spend a night out together

'When I went downstairs I was instantly attracted to the one on the right. Diane was standing on the right and Darlene was standing on the left and I was instantly attracted to Diane,' he said on the Jeff Probst show.

After meeting in 1998, the boys went to visit the girls at their home in St. Louis, Missouri, and took them on a double date to a baseball game.

Proud father: Diane and Darlene's father walked them both down the aisle together at their joint wedding

'Just like two normal families, only closer': Mr and Mrs Sanders, twice over

The two couples hit it off, got engaged on the same day, and decided to share a wedding.

'We had a double wedding and Darlene and I decided that we wanted to wear the same dress and then our dad walked us both down the aisle at the same time,' Diane said.

The families built their houses on 
adjoining plots and took out the fence between the two to create one 
enormous garden that they could all share.

Love: The two pairs of twins maintain close bond by living next to each other with a shared garden

The girls: Diane and Darlene are hard to tell apart to all but their husbands and children

The boys: Mark and Craig Sanders took the girls to a baseball game for a first, double, date

When Diane and Craig produced identical twin sons in 2001, they beat million-to-one odds to do so.

Now they have neighboring houses and 
the five children - including Diane and Craig's identical 12-year-old 
sons Colby and Brady -Â  all play together.

Whole gang: The Sanders family gathers with their five kids

But Craig Sanders said despite all the unusual coincidences, they see themselves as 'Just two normal families who happen to be close to one another.'

Happy times: Darlene and Mark share smiles with their children

Mark Sanders admitted identical twins marrying identical twins was 'pretty unusual.'

'There aren't that many of them that we are aware of in the United States, and when you throw in a third set of identical twins, that makes it even more unusual.'

Close family: The Sanders now have five children between them, including identical twins Colby and Brady

Next generation: Colby and Brady Sanders are the identical twin sons of Diane and Craig
