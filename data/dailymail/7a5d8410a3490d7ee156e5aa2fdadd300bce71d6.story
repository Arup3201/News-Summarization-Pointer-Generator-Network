An Indianapolis couple have been charged with neglect in the death of their paralyzed 18-year-old daughter who died wearing only a diaper and covered in blackened bedsores in a house crawling with gnats. 

John and Lavonne Kelley are accused of failing to seek medical treatment for Linda Kelley, who suffered from spina bifida and died August 4 in the family's filthy, roach-infested home.

The Marion County coroner's office determined the cause of death was acute and chronic bedsores, some of which were so deep they exposed bone and organs. Poor hygiene was listed as a contributory factor.

The Kelleys each face a felony count of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury. Court documents show they had previously been accused of neglect.

Linda Kelley was paralyzed from the waist down and had a shunt, or tube, in her brain.

John Kelley, 51, and his 40-year-old wife, Lavonne, were taken into police custody Wednesday on charges of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury. They are being held in jail without bond. 

Lavonne Kelley reportedly told police she noticed broken skin and bruises on her daughter's body two days before her passing, but Linda allegedly refused to go the hospital and would not let anyone turn her over, according to The Indianapolis Star. 

Linda Kelley's heartbreaking living conditions were revealed during September hearings into how the 18-year-old's case was handled by the Department of Child Services before her death.

A DCS case worker and employees from Damar Services, which provides care to patients with special needs, had visited the teen at her parents' home in Indianapolis just six days before she died.

Marion Juvenile Court Judge Marilyn Moores held hearings in the fall to see if staff had falsified positive reviews of the girl's living conditions, the Indianapolis Star reported.

But she concluded that they did not. Instead, there was a 'negligent oversight, if not reckless disregard, of the conditions of the home', she said.

DCS Director Mary Beth Bonaventura said the girl was failed by multiple people, including the case worker, the DCS and her parents, Lavonne and John Kelley. 

The girl lived with her mother, Lavone Kelley, and her father. Neither have been charged - and it is not known if they knew about the sores on the girl's legs - but police are investigating

The DCS case worker, Teresa Carter, said she was shocked when she learned about the conditions because when she visited six days earlier, the home was in good condition and the girl had smiled.

But after the death, she returned to the home and found it covered with dog feces, trash, soiled adult diapers and cigarette butts and saw bugs crawling through the refrigerator. 

She also learned that Linda had sores below her waist. 

 At the hearing, she admitted she had only checked some rooms in the house and did not check the Linda's legs for sores. She knew the girl had previously suffered a leg injury but after it healed, she did not see the need to continue to check her legs, she said. 

Carter said that she had been handling up to 28 cases at the time, whereas the legal limit in Indiana is 17. She explained that she was unable to keep up and could not sleep at night.

But the DCS, which fired Carter and her supervisor after Linda passed away, said that workload was not a valid excuse for the oversights, and that the visits should have been carried out more thoroughly.

The department had a long relationship with the Kelleys, who reportedly neglected their children in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2012.

In December, the DCS learned the couple had failed to take their daughter to all of her doctors' appointments, including for a sore on her leg. When they checked the home at the time, it was filthy and crawling with gnats, records show.

The department entered into a judge-approved agreement with the family to clean up the conditions, bring in a pest exterminator, attend all doctors' appointments and re-enroll the teenager in school. 

The couple apparently met the terms of their agreement and the case closed in mid-July, although Carter and Damar Services workers went for the final meeting on July 29.

The president of Damar Services, Jim Dalton, said his workers had never seen the home in such a terrible shape as on the day she died and that if they had, they would have reported it.
