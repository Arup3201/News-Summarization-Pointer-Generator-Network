Mark Hughes has revealed his time at Queens Park Rangers was ‘without a shadow of a doubt’ his toughest time in management but insisted he has ‘no cross to bear’ over the manner of his departure.

Harry Redknapp has claimed there was ‘not a good atmosphere’ when he took over from Hughes in November 2012 but the Stoke City manager says there was ‘resentment around the place’ even when he walked in 10 months earlier.

Hughes took over from Neil Warnock with the club struggling against relegation but kept the side up after making a number of high-profile signings.

He then brought more players into the club in a bid to strengthen the squad but admits the dressing room dynamic ‘didn’t work’ as QPR began the following season without a win in 12 games.

‘At the end of the day I was judged on results,’ he said. ‘So I lost my job I accept that. I was the figurehead of the club at that time. I haven’t got any cross to bear whatsoever.

‘It was a difficult period, difficult job when I first went in. I had 16 or 17 games and we needed to keep QPR in the league, which we were very pleased to.

‘We made a lot of changes which we felt would enhance the club. Sometimes it doesn’t come off and you hold your hands up. The players were very good but the dynamic of the dressing room didn’t work.

‘We weren’t trying to damage the club. That time wasn’t great for anybody connected to the club.

‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing but I felt we could have turned it around. It’s been done before. It was done last year at Crystal Palace. There were still good players.

QPR have lost three of their four league games so far this season, including defeat to Manchester United

‘It was difficult when I walked in. The atmosphere wasn’t easy, there was a bit of resentment around the place. You try to address that.

‘We made big decisions. I felt at the end of the season the squad wasn’t strong enough to stay in the league. We had the opportunity to change that.

‘The feeling is too many came in at the same time. But a lot of people were out of contract so there was always going to be a big turnover.’
