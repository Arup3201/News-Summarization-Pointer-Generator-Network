Arsenal duo David Ospina and Gabriel Paulista are increasingly integral parts of the Gunners back line according to pundit Danny Murphy.

Keeper David Ospina put in another reassuring performance, making a string of key saves as Arsenal beat Everton 2-0 on Sunday to recover from the midweek horror show against Monaco.

Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy also singled out centre back Gabriel Paulista, a January transfer window acquisition from Villarreal, who impressed in defence in place of Per Mertesacker.

‘Ospina has been really impressive. He made a really important save at 1-0 and got better as the game went on,' Murphy said on Match of the Day.

‘I thought the criticism he received in the week (against Monaco) was harsh. Gabriel reads situations and those two have been real positives.'

The Gunners next face Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road on Wednesday, hoping to cement their place in the Premier League top four.
