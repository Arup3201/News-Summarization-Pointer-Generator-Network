Cameron appointed Joanna Shields, a former managing director of Facebook in Europe, to the Lords

David Cameron has long faced criticism over how he has made Downing Street far too close to internet giants since he became Prime Minister.

In summer, the concerns reached fever pitch when he appointed Joanna Shields, a former managing director of Facebook in Europe, to the Lords.

Despite the fact that the firm has avoided paying its UK taxes, there is even speculation that she could one day be granted a ministerial role.

The appointment deepened concerns that the Conservatives are too close to firms such as Facebook and Google and that they have the ear of the government on sensitive topics.

Facebook is a US-based social network company set up by Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. Its UK arm is based in Covent Garden, and focuses mainly on advertising sales.

Miss Shields had a long history in internet firms. She was the managing director of Google in Europe and Africa until 2006, and then chief executive of Bebo, another social networking site.

She then went on to take the helm at Facebook, where she was managing director of the company’s European wing between 2008 and 2012 – around the time that the firm was accused of avoiding tax.

Facebook UK only paid a small amount of corporation tax in 2011 – much lower than experts said would be expected.

And in 2012, Facebook paid zero corporation tax in the UK. It was one of a number of global firms accused of registering subsidiary companies in low-tax countries to avoid paying their full British tax obligations.

Facebook UK filed a pre-tax loss of £2.4million on turnover of only £34.6million, despite estimated ad revenues of £223million. The company pushed much of its revenues through a complex scheme in Ireland.

At the time, the chairwoman of the powerful Commons public accounts committee called it ‘deliberate manipulation of accounts’.

And last month, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million in 2013.

Despite the controversy over the firm’s tax affairs, Miss Shields was unveiled in 2012 as Mr Cameron’s digital adviser and chief executive of the government’s ‘Tech City’ to help boost internet start-ups in east London.

The dual US and British national is a non-executive director of the London Stock Exchange. She also sits on Boris Johnson’s ‘smart board’ which aims to establish London as Europe’s digital capital.

In August, Miss Shields was raised to the Lords – prompting Labour MP John Mann to say: ‘This is showing two fingers to every taxpaying business and taxpayer in the country, and it’s a green light to tax avoiders.’

Facebook says it always pays tax according to the laws of each country.

Last month, Mr Cameron pledged tough actions to force companies such as Facebook – along with Google, Starbucks and Amazon – to meet their full UK tax obligations.

‘We’ve cut the rate of corporation tax down to 20 per cent, we’re the most competitive place to come and start a business, but here’s the deal – if they have a low tax rate, those companies have damn well got to pay it.’

But some will question whether the government, which has such close links to these firms, will really apply the required pressure.

The Tories are even closer to Google, which has also been accused of avoiding tax. Their bosses enjoy regular access to senior ministers, while some Conservative employees have taken jobs with the company.

For example, Rachel Whetstone, Google’s global head of communications, is a close friend of the Camerons and is married to Steve Hilton, the Prime Minister’ s ex-policy chief.

And Naomi Gummer, a former adviser to Jeremy Hunt when he was Culture Secretary, is now a public policy analyst at Google.
