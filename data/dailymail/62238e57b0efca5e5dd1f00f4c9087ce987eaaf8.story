Zaid Al-Hilli denies shooting his brother as he sat in his BMW car close to the French town of Annecy

The Surrey accountant arrested over the murder of his brother in the Alps today claims he was physically attacked by him at their last ever meeting.

Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, denies shooting his brother as he sat in his BMW car close to the French town of Annecy. 

But he says Mr Al-Hilli had a fight with his brother, the then 49-year-old Saad Al-Hilli, in November 2011 over their father’s inheritance.

‘He pinned me down,’ said Mr Al-Hilli.

‘I was on the bed in my bedroom and he pinned me down. That’s it. That’s all.’

On September 5, 2012, Saad was blasted to death along with his wife Ikbal, 47, his mother-in-law Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, and Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French cyclist. 

Now Mr Al-Hilli, who comes from an Anglo-Iraqi background, is on police bail following his arrest on suspicion of planning the murders – claims he also vehemently denies. 

Instead he told the Sunday Times that he believes Mr Mollier was the real target of the gunman and that the French police were concentrating on the Al-Hillis out of bigotry towards foreigners. 

‘I have told the police from the beginning that I am an open book. I have nothing to hide,’ said Mr Hilli, who was arrested in June.

Eric Maillaud, the French prosecutor who has become the figurehead of the enquiry, pushed for Mr Al-Hilli’s arrest but has since admitted that the case against him ‘would not last 20 minutes’ in a court of law. 

Mr Al-Hilli, a payroll manager who lives in Chessington, Surrey, said he was in Worthing, Sussex, on the day of the murder, and his alibi has been confirmed.

Mystery: The scene of the killing in the Alps last year, which was believed to target the al-Hilli family

He has spent a total of 25 hours talking to the British police, but has refused all requests to travel to France.

‘The French, I don’t trust them at all,’ said Mr Al-Hilli.

‘My brother was killed there in that region and I am not going to take the risk. If they wanted to come over here, that’s fine.’

Mr Al-Hilli said a feud over a £1millon house in Claygate, Surrey, was the only problem in an otherwise ‘smooth’ relationship between the brothers. 

The French claim that one of the reasons Mr Al-Hilli was arrested was because of a series of mysterious phone calls to Romania when he could have been ‘hiring’ a hitman.

But Mr Al-Hilli said this was absolute fiction, saying: ‘I have no idea where Romania came from; I’ve never even been asked about Romania.’

Mr Al-Hilli said he would be prepared to take a lie detector and was on ‘a mission to find out the truth.’

He thinks the possibility of Mr Mollier being the target has been played down because of the influence of the ‘rich, powerful local family’ of Mollier’s girlfriend, the pharmacy heiress Claire Schutz.

Mr Mollier had just started three years paternity leave from the nuclear components factory where he worked, and was relying on the now extremely rich Ms Schutz to support him.

Investigation: Police outside Mr al-Hilli's home in Surrey hunting for clues into his death

It was Ms Schutz’s father, Thierry Schutz, who suggested the cycling route towards the village of Chevaline along which Mr Mollier died. 

In the year since Mr Mollier’s death, his surviving family have refused to release a photograph him, have never paid public tribute to him, and have attempted to keep all details of his life a secret.

The Al-Hillis’ daughters, Zeena, then 4, and Zainab, then 7, survived the attack, and are now in the care of other family members.
