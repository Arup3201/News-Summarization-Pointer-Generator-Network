Bust-boosting surgery has never been more popular, with more than 11,000 boob job operations taking place in the UK alone each year.

But not everyone wants to go under the knife, including some of the A-list clients who visit Harley Street medic Dr Neetu Nirdosh.

Instead of scalpels and implants, they are opting for a new treatment which has been dubbed 'the Botox boob job' and uses injectables to plump up the cleavage.

New look: The 'Botox boob job' is said to boost the breasts by up to a cup size but only lasts for six months

'The Breastox- Botox is fast becoming the must have pre-red carpet procedure for my celebrity clients,' explains Dr Nirdosh. 

'It is a knifeless instantaneous breast lift. This form of breast augmentation works best for those who are between a cup size A and C and is safer and quicker than regular surgery.'

The £1,000 treatment involves injecting Botox into the pectoral muscles which temporarily relaxes them, leaving the shoulder and surrounding chest muscles to take the strain.

As a result, breasts are lifted and look higher and firmer, although given Botox wears off, the effect lasts for a maximum of six months.

'There's no downtime, no reported side effects, no scars and it is virtually painless,' adds Dr Nirdosh. 

'It takes less than 30 minutes and is the ideal treatment for women suffering from post-pregnancy droopy boobs, ageing, sagging breasts or a wrinkly bust line as a result of sun damage.

Risky: Breast enhancement isn't without its risks as the recent PIP implant scandal demonstrated

'It is also good if you want a bit of extra support so you can go braless as many of my red carpet clients do.'

Traditional breast enhancement involves having a cut made either beneath the breasts or in the armpits and inserting a silicone implant between the breast tissue and the chest muscle.

Operations cost between £3,500 and £5,000 and, according to the NHS, complications can include infection, scarring and loss of sensation in the nipple.

Nevertheless, according to figures produced by the British Association of Aesthetic Surgeons [BAAPS], they remain one of the most popular cosmetic surgeries.

But thanks to scandals such as the PIP implant saga, which saw women fitted with enhancements made with industrial, rather than medical, grade silicone, many are turning to 'safer' injectables such as Botox.

Although Macrolane, a filler marketed as a 'lunchtime boob jab' was withdrawn from sale two years ago following claims that 25 per cent of patients suffered complications after the treatment, others have proved considerably less problematic.

Among them is Botox, which, according to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons [ISAPS], is the most popular non-surgical cosmetic treatment in the world.

In total, say ISAPS, 45,464 Botox injections were carried out by qualified practitioners on British women last year.
