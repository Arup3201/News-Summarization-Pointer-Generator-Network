A healthcare assistant at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital dragged a frail dementia patient around by his pyjamas and called him an ‘animal’, investigators have said.

Bonka Kostova allegedly pulled the 73-year-old out of a toilet in a state of undress and told him she ‘hated having to work with people like him’.

She will appear before the Nursing and Midwifery Council next week to face charges that her aggression and treatment of the patient, who also has Parkinson’s disease, means she is not fit to practise.

Fears: David Cameron has ordered probes into five more trusts following the Mid Staffordshire scandal but expert Brian Jarman believes 21 more could be added to the list

Pressure: Campaigners and members of the 'Cure the NHS' group outside the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre after reading the findings of the Francis Inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust Foundation

Bulgarian-born Kostova is accused of
shouting at him: ‘You are no longer a human being but an animal.’ She 
is alleged to have said ‘I hate you’ or words to that effect.

An inquiry found up to 1,200 patients
died on casualty wards at Stafford between 2005 and 2009 thanks to an 
obsession with Labour targets.

The latest incident was in 2010 – one
year after the period covered by the report – suggesting the problems 
could be continuing.

Last night it emerged that the 
Mid-Staffordshire trust, which covers the hospital, was one of 100 who 
have still not signed an Alzheimer’s Society pledge to improve dementia 
care.

Jeremy Hughes, the charity’s chief executive, said: ‘The appalling failures at Mid-Staffs affected people with dementia.

‘Despite the Government’s prioritisation of the condition, some hospitals are still failing vulnerable people.

'Lengthy stays in hospital can cause people’s condition to worsen, rather than helping them to get well.

‘Hospitals must act now to improve care for people with dementia.

'Only half of hospitals have made a commitment and we need Stafford Hospital to be one of them to support improvement.

'Every day of inaction threatens more scandals of neglect and inappropriate treatment.’

The latest scandal to emerge is alleged to have happened on July 22 2010, according to the NMC charge sheet.

Although she is a registered midwife,
Bulgarian-born Kostova had been employed by the trust as a healthcare 
support worker since April 2009. The incident happened when she was on a
night shift on ward six at Stafford Hospital.

The sheet reveals that Kostova 
continued to be employed at the trust for a further two months. Her case
will be heard on February 12.

Analysis suggests more than 4,000 patients a year are dying needlessly in the care of 26 NHS trusts.

The study shows the scandal at 
Stafford hospital – where 1,200 are thought to have died through neglect
– was not an isolated case.

The figure of 26 represents one in 
six of the country’s health trusts. David Cameron has responded to the 
crisis by ordering probes into five trusts with high mortality rates.

But Brian Jarman, a globally-recognised expert on hospital performance, believes 21 more should be added to the list.

To come up with that figure, the 
professor compared the numbers of patients who would normally be 
expected to die at a trust with the number of actual deaths.

The ‘normal’ figure is based on admissions and illnesses.

His technique – developed in the 1990s – led to the realisation in 2007 that too many patients were dying at Mid Staffordshire.

The head of the NHS was facing 
growing calls to step down yesterday. The investigator who carried out 
the original inquiry into Mid Staffordshire said Sir David Nicholson 
should go.

Heather Wood, who headed the 2009 
Healthcare Commission probe but has since joined the campaign group Cure
the NHS, said: ‘If this were a private sector organisation that had 
failed to such an extent, we would be calling for the boss to take 
responsibility.

‘There is a big case to answer for the creation of that culture.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
