Met Office workers are preparing to strike for the first time in decades this week causing possible disruption to forecasts as storms continue to batter large swathes of the country.

Staff at the Met Office's headquarters in Exeter, Devon, will walk out at 2pm on Thursday in an ongoing row over pay.

Workers in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and other frontline stations will also walk out at the same time and set up picket lines for the duration of the three-hour strike.

It comes as forecasters predict heavy rain and possible snow will hit large parts of the country. 

Met Office workers belonging to the union Prospect are to strike over a continuing pay freeze which they claim is 'damaging an otherwise successful, efficient and growing business'.

However, it is feared the strike could cause disruption to the Met Office's weather service as almost half of its employees will be unavailable during the industrial action.

Prospect, which has 950 members, warned that the walkout could affect the accuracy of forecasts especially if one of the forecasting models was to break down. 

A union leaflet said: 'Forecasts depend on the Met Office model for accuracy. That model runs four times a day on one of the most sophisticated and complex IT systems in the country.

'People are proud to run a seamless service to the customer 24 hours a day, 365 days a week.

'The fact that people are now taking action about pay and withdrawing that goodwill shows how strongly they feel and puts the service at real risk.' 

The escalating campaign of action began last Thursday when union members wrote to Business Minister Matthew Hancock, calling on him to allow the Met Office the freedom to manage its reward system and pay fairly compared to market rates.

In the letter, union members argued that the pay freeze was limiting the Met Office's ability to recruit the specialist figures it requires.

Workers said they fear that without the flexibility to pay fairly:

The union said it had no alternative but to take action with the three-hour strike on Thursday, but said services with implications to national security and safety of life would be maintained throughout.

Gordon Hutchinson, a representative for Prospect, said: 'This is unprecedented, no one can remember the last time people went on strike here over pay - it must be decades ago.

'It shows how strongly people feel about a government pay policy completely at odds with what the Prime Minister advocates for the private sector.

'David Cameron says successful businesses should give their staff a pay rise, but won't allow the Met Office freedom to manage its own reward system.'

Helen Stevens, Prospect negotiator, added: 'It's sad to see such a magnificent organisation held back by political ideology.

'First and foremost our members want the Met Office and its world class science to thrive. It can't do that if it can't recruit and retain the right people.

'Our members are reasonable people who have tried to resolve this through other means but have found the Met Office has its hands tied behind its back.'

The Met Office said it was working closely with Prospect and was 'not expecting any significant impacts'.

A spokesman added: 'We're disappointed that some staff have chosen to take this action but we are confident our robust business continuity measures will reduce the impact of the action. 

'We are pleased that the Trades Union Prospect is working with the Met Office to ensure that the threat of industrial action is mitigated for any service where safety of life is at risk, for example - severe weather warnings. 

'We recognise the right of staff to take this action based on a legal mandate.'
