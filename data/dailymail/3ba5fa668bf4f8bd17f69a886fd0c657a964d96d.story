Mammoth Lakes saw nearly 600 earthquakes in 24 hours last week - the worst swarm of tremors in nearly a decade.

Monitors show a concentration of seismic activity in the region which has sent shockwaves through the the California town.

Starting just before 5am on Thursday they have ranged between 1.0 and 3.8 in magnitude.

At least 109 of the earthquakes were magnitude 2.0 or greater, and at least six, however, were greater than magnitude 3.0.

A member of the U.S. Geological Survey told the LA Times that it is the worst spell seen in California's Eastern Sierra in at least 10 years.

Researcher David Shelly said that they now be tracking the area - one of the most seismically active in the country - closely.

Even though they have sent ripples through the community, residents say they are used to it as there are constantly small shocks.

There are 17 volcanoes in the region, however most of them are dormant, while there are a countless number of fault lines across the Long Valley Caldera - a 20-mile depression next to Mammoth Mountain.

The crater was formed 760,000 years ago during a 'super-eruption' which saw hot ash blanket most of the Western states   

Mr Shelly described that deep down in the earth, there is magma, but it is not moving and not what is causing the earthquakes. 

The swarms are partly caused by volcanic activity under Mammoth Mountain - a volcano which hasn't erupted in 57,000 years 

He said: 'It doesn't mean that the volcano is any more active,' he said. 'It's an ongoing process in an volcanic system.'

The earthquakes are usually triggered when water and carbon dioxide above the magma move to higher layers of the earth's crust and cracks in the faults.

The increase in fluid pressure sets off the movements.

In the 1980s, the area was hit with a succession 6.0-magnitude tremors. However it may have been overshadowed by the Mount St. Helens eruption in Washington state - when 57 people died.

At the beginning of this year, residents commemorated the 20th anniversary of the North Ridge earthquake.

It centered in Reseda, a neighborhood in the north-central San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, killing 57 people and injuring more than 5,000.
