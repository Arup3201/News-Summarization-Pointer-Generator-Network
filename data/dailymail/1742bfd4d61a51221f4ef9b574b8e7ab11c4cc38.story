The bus-sized meteor that slammed into Russia in February, injuring more than 1,000 people, setting off car alarms and shattering windows sent a plume of cosmic dust into the stratosphere that showered the Earth for three months.

According to NASA's Suomi NPP weather satellite, the meteor left behind hundreds of tons of microscopic rubble when it detonated 15 miles above the city of Chelyabinsk on February 15.

Some six months later, using the satellite's Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite, the space agency has released a video showing how the dust from the meteor, which also left visible chunks on the ground for passers by to pick up, was thrown up 28 miles and coated the Earth.

Dust: According to NASA's Suomi NPP weather satellite, the meteor left behind hundreds of tones of microscopic rubble when it detonated 15 miles above the city of Chelyabinsk on February 15

Lasting effect: The bus-sized meteor that slammed into Russia in February, injuring more than 1,000 people, setting off car alarms and shattering windows sent a plume of cosmic dust into the stratosphere that showered the Earth for three months

When the roughly 60 feet meteor exploded the heavier bits fell to the Earth, but the dust rose to dizzying heights, according to NASA.

That represents far less material than is ejected by an erupting volcano, but it still got dragged around by the circulating atmosphere. After four days, the Suomi sensors had watched that dust plume wrap all the way around the planet.

Eventually, it smeared into a single, 250 mile wide belt at an altitude of roughly 22 miles. The satellite watched it sit there there for months, slowly settling downward about 295 feet each day.

Terrifying: Almost 1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of 46,000 mph

Friction: Burning from the friction with Earth's thin air, the space rock exploded 14.5 miles above the Russian town of Chelyabinsk

It was NASA Goddard atmospheric 
physicist Nick Gorkavyi who came up with the idea to to track the cloud 
using the incredible satellite.

'Indeed,
we saw the formation of a new dust belt in Earth's stratosphere, and 
achieved the first space-based observation of the long-term evolution of
a bolide plume,' Gorkavyi, a Chelyabinsk native, said, according to Space.com.

'Initial
measurements 3.5 hours after the meteor explosion showed the dust 25 
miles high in the atmosphere, speeding east at 190 mph.'

And within days the plume had 'circumnavigated the entire globe and returned to Chelyabinsk, creating a complete global belt.'

Wake-up call: Experts said asteroid 2012 DA14 should drive nations to work together to create a warning system

Damage: If an early warning system existed countries could prepare for the destruction caused by asteroid debris

Suomi only takes snapshots of the 
belt as it passes by so researchers simulated the dust using a pair of 
atmospheric models. One model is used specifically for ash plumes from 
volcanic eruptions, and the other captures aerosols.

Almost
1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the Earth's 
atmosphere at a speed of 46,000 mph, blowing out the windows of 900 
schools and hospitals and damaging around 100,000 homes.

The
debris narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on the industrial 
city which has a population of 1.13 million but spread panic through its
streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash.
