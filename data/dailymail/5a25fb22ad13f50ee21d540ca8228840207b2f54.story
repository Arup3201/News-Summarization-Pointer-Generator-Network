A Malaysia Airlines plane was forced to abort a take-off after learning that it was on a collision course with an incoming airliner.

Flight MH136, which had 167 passengers on board, was already rolling down the runway at Adelaide Airport yesterday when it was forced to slam on the brakes.

Adelaide Air Traffic Control radioed the flight, bound for Kuala Lumpur, with instructions to abort the takeoff after realising the plane was on a collision course with in incoming jet.

The near-miss happened at Adelaide Airport yesterday as the plane was rolling down the runway with 167 passengers on board

According to Malaysia's New Straits Times, an official said: 'MH136 stopped its takeoff safely and waited the required cool-down time on its brakes before departing from Adelaide.'

The Aviation Herald reported 'that a Tiger Airways Airbus A320 on approach had been too high and too fast on approach'.

Air traffic control reportedly wanted to make sure the Malaysia Airlines A330 'didn't climb underneath' it.

The news comes just two weeks after another Malaysian Airlines plane, flight MH17, was shot down in a suspected attack by Russian separatist while flying over Ukraine.

All 298 people on board, including 80 children, died after the plane was allegedly hit by a BUK surface-to-air missile fired by rebels demanding independence from Ukraine.

On that occasion Malaysia airlines drew criticism for flying over a war-zone, but it was later established that the plane was flying along an agreed flight path through unrestricted airspace.

It is believed that separatist fighters accidentally fired on the civilian aircraft, thinking it was military.

And in March this year a third Malaysia Airlines flight, MH370, attracted worldwide media attention after it went missing while traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. 

According to Malaysia's New Straits Times, an official said: 'MH136 stopped its takeoff safely and waited the required cool-down time on its brakes before departing from Adelaide'

Two weeks ago 298 people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 died after the plane was hit by a surface-to-air missile above Ukraine, and in March Flight MH370 disappeared along with 298 passengers and crew

The flight deviated from its intended flight path, making a U-turn and heading out towards the Bay of Bengal, before it dropped off of military radar.

To date, no trace of the plane or the 239 passengers and crew on board has ever been found.

Theories about the disappearance include a cockpit fire, the smoke from which could have knocked the pilots unconscious, leaving the plane to drift until it ran out of fuel and dropped into the ocean.

Several investigations have also focused on one of the pilots, Zaharie Shah, who owned a home flight simulator and had plotted a route into the southern Indian Ocean in the days before the plane disappeared.

Searches are still ongoing in the Indian Ocean for the wreckage, and while hopes have been raised several times by electrical 'ping' signals coming from the ocean floor, so far nothing has been found.
