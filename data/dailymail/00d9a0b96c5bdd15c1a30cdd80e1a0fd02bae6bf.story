A former Nasa computer specialist, who claims he was sacked due to his belief that God created the universe, is due in court today.

David Coppedge, who worked as a 'team lead' at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), in California, is suing the agency after claiming he was discriminated against after talking about 'intelligent design' and handing out DVDs on the theory at work.

Intelligent design is the belief that a higher power must have had a 
hand in creation because life is too complex to have developed through 
evolution alone.

Dismissed: David Coppedge claims he was discriminated against when he was fired from his post on the Cassini Mission last year

Coppedge lost his team lead title in 2009 and was let go last year after 15 years on the Cassini mission, which explored Saturn.

In the lawsuit, Coppedge said he 
believes other things led to his demotion, including his support 
for a state ballot measure that sought to define marriage as limited to 
heterosexual couples and his request to rename the annual holiday party a
'Christmas party.'

Coppedge's attorney, William Becker, 
contends his client was singled out by his bosses because they perceived
his belief in intelligent design to be religious.

Coppedge had a 
reputation around JPL as an evangelical Christian, and interactions with
co-workers led some to label him as a Christian conservative, Becker 
said.

'David 
had this reputation for being a Christian, for being a practising one. 
He did not go around evangelising or proselytising. But if he found out 
that someone was a Christian he would say, "Oh that's interesting, what 
denomination are you?"' Becker said.

Lawsuit: David Coppedge worked as a 'team lead' on the Cassini mission exploring Saturn and its many moons before being demoted in 2009 and sacked last year

'He's not apologising for who he is. He's an evangelical Christian.'

In an emailed statement, JPL dismissed Mr Coppedge's claims.

In
court papers, lawyers for the California Institute of Technology, which
manages JPL for NASA, said Coppedge received a written warning 
because his co-workers complained of harassment.

They also said Coppedge lost his 'team lead' status because of ongoing conflicts with others.

Caltech
lawyers contend Mr Coppedge was one of two Cassini technicians and 
among 246 JPL employees let go last year due to planned budget cuts.

The case has generated interest among supporters of intelligent design. 
The Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian civil rights group, and the 
Discovery Institute, a proponent of intelligent design, are both 
supporting Coppedge's case.

'There is basically a war on anyone who dissents from
Darwin and we've seen that for several years,' said John West, 
associate director of Center for Science and Culture at the 
Seattle-based Discovery Institute. 'This is free speech, freedom of 
conscience 101.'

Meanwhile, the National Center for Science Education, which rejects intelligent 
design as thinly veiled creationism, is also watching the case and has 
posted all the legal filings on its website.

'It
would be unfortunate if the court took what seems to be a fairly 
straightforward employment law case and allowed it to become this 
tangled mess of trying to adjudicate scientific matters,' said Josh 
Rosenau, NCSE's programmes and policy director.

'It looks like a pretty straightforward case. The mission that he was working on was winding down and he was laid off.'

At its heart this is a straightforward discrimination 
case, said Eugene Volokh, a professor of First Amendment law at the 
University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.

Space agency: David Coppedge began working for JPL as a contractor in 1996 and was hired in 2003

'The
question is whether the plaintiff was fired simply because he was 
wasting people's time and bothering them in ways that would have led him
to being fired regardless of whether it was about religion or whether 
he was treated worse based on the religiosity of his beliefs,' said Mr 
Volokh. 'If he can show that, then he's got a good case.'

Mr
Coppedge, who began working for JPL as a contractor in 1996 and was 
hired in 2003, is active in the intelligent design sphere and runs a 
website that interprets scientific discoveries through the lens of 
intelligent design.

His father authored an anti-evolution book and founded a Christian outreach group.

He is also a board member for 
Illustra Media, a company that produces video documentaries examining 
the scientific evidence for intelligent design. The company produces the
videos that Mr Coppedge was handing out to co-workers, said Becker.

His main duties 
at JPL were to maintain computer networks and troubleshoot technical 
problems for the mission. In 2000, he was named 'team lead', serving as a
liaison between technicians and managers for nearly a decade before 
being demoted in 2009.

He 
sued in April 2010 alleging religious discrimination, retaliation and 
harassment and amended his suit to include wrongful termination after 
losing his job last year.

Coppedge is seeking attorney's fees and costs, damages for wrongful 
termination and a statement from the judge that his rights were 
violated, said Becker.

Opening statements in the lawsuit are expected to start today in Los Angeles' Superior Court 
after lawyers spent yesterday arguing several pretrial motions.
