Sky Sports customers would be hit with a staggering £10 per month increase in their subscription rates, or £120 a year, to pay for the new £5 billion Premier League deals if the broadcaster passed on the full cost to their ‘football viewers’, according to analysts.

While industry experts do not expect the price hikes to be quite that extreme in the immediate future, there is a broad consensus Sky customers will pay an initial rise of around £4 per month, or £48 per year, to help Sky meet the rights cost.

Even Sky insiders privately acknowledge that some of the cost will be passed on to customers.

The Premier League announced last week that Sky and BT Sport will together pay £5.136bn for live UK rights to show games for three years from 2016-17 to 2018-19 inclusive.

Sky will show 126 games per season (up from 116 now), and BT Sport will show 42, up from 38. But though the split from 2016 will remain much the same, Sky have paid massively more for their share in the new deal, or £1.392bn per year, up from £760m per year now.

That annual extra spend of £632m every year will be partially offset by Sky no longer paying around £130m a year for Champions League rights from next season, which they lost to BT Sport.

‘Sky have made it clear they will do what they can to absorb the extra cost,’ says Toby Syfret of industry experts Enders Analysis. ‘But it’s a bloody big sum to recover’.

Sky Sports have paid £4.176 billion for Premier League TV rights to show 126 matches

Mr Syfret added that if the total extra spending by Sky were passed on solely to sports channel customers, around 5 million of them, it would result in a £10 per month extra charge, on top of the current £24.50 for sports channels bundle. ‘But £35 a month is the last thing Sky want [to charge],’ he says.

His company estimates that Sky could instead raise around £100m in new income per year by levying an extra £1 a month on all customers, in which case a rise of few pounds a month to all Sky customers would pay for the rights.

Sources claim BT Sport always intended to give the impression they would bid huge sums - in order to force Sky to pay more, and then increase costs. Analyst Joshua Raymond, the chief market strategist at City Index, agrees.

‘Sky has paid 83 per cent more than it did last time for a similar range of match slots,’ he says. ‘Sky has been duped into over-paying significantly and its now likely that its subscribers will have to absorb at least some of the additional cost as a result.’

Mr Raymond estimates subscription fees will rise by up to £4 per month each year for the sports packages.

A third expert, Roddy Davidson of Westhouse Securities, says losing the Champions League was ‘a blow’ to Sky, meaning in terms screening English club side live in big events ‘all their eggs are in one basket, the Premier League.’

Mr Davidson expects price rises to be introduced across Sky’s customer base in a way that does not make it obvi-ous the cash is for the football. ‘In terms of visibility on how they achieve it, that’s another matter. Our view is BT played a cool hand here and Sky had to go big to keep the packages.’
