Night clubbers, beware. An Obamacare evangelist may be coming to a bar near you.

On a call outlining its strategy to get people to sign up for Obamacare over the summer, leading Obamacare advocacy group Enroll America said it will get more creative with its outreach tactics – including hitting up night clubs – now that only certain groups of people remain eligible to sign up for health coverage.

'If it's a 
health fair, we wanna have a table set up. If it's a long line at a 
night club, we want somebody walking up and down it, talking to folks 
while they're stuck there,' John Gilbert, National Field Director of Enroll America, told fellow Obamacare recruiters on the call.

The group will begin its new outreach operation in May.

Pro-Obamacare group Enroll America says it will hit up night clubs, like the one in this file photo, next month to look for people without health insurance

Open enrollment into Obamacare closed on March 31. Among those now eligible for special enrollment are young people aging off of their parents' insurance plans.

Under the new rules, insurance companies are required to provide coverage for policyholders' dependents until age 26.

Young Invincibles, a youth focused pro-Obamacare group, estimates that 11,500 Americans will turn 26 each day between now and
 November when the open enrollment period begins anew.  That's 2.6 million young people, according to a recent Young Invincibles report, based on data 
from the U.S. Census Bureau, concludes.

There's a 'little bit of a "Where's 
Waldo?" component' to identifying people who fall into this category, 
Enroll America National Field Director John Gilbert said on last week's call.

But Enroll America thinks it's figured out a few good places to find and recruit these non-traditional enrollees, including night clubs, court houses and CVS Caremark drug stores.

'If it's a long line at a night club, we want somebody walking up and down it, talking to folks while they're stuck there,' John Gilbert, National Field Director of Enroll America, told fellow Obamacare recruiters on a call

'We want to go to wherever people are and engage them on their terms,' Gilbert said.

The 'terms' on which Enroll America could
 find itself with young people waiting in line at the club when it comes
 around to lecture them on their health care options might not be good. Young people - who may already be intoxicated - may not be predisposed to discuss serious issues like their health care coverage while they're trying to have a fun evening out with friends.

Enroll America did not return a request for further comment on its outreach efforts.

'Obamacare "youth outreach" tactics seem to get funnier as time goes on. Now they plan to ask young people in line at clubs to fork over thousands of dollars for a government program designed to rob us?' said Corie Whalen, a spokeswoman for youth advocacy organization Generation Opportunity, in an email to MailOnline.

'Thinking about it though, it makes sense that they wouldn’t waste their time marketing to us while we’re sober.'

Best known for its 'Creepy Uncle Sam' ads that feature the government mascot looming over young people during sensitive doctor-patient discussions about their health, 'Gen Opp' has been encouraging young people to 'Opt-Out' of Obamacare.

The group's most effective tactic for signing young people to opt out has been holding college tailgate parties. The group told The Weekly Standard in 2013 that it would consider reaching out to young people at events like concerts during warm weather.

Enroll America listed court houses as another place it would target for Obamacare outreach. Among those who qualify to sign up for Obamacare outside of the normal enrollment process are people who were recently released from jail and people getting married or divorced - all of whom would have to visit a court house.

A location the group said its had success signing people up in the past that it plans to continue recruiting people from is CVS, as seen here at an Enroll America event at a CVS in Texas

Jenny Sullivan, Director of Enroll America's Best Practices Institute, reminded listeners on the call of the importance of keeping enrollment numbers up throughout the rest of the year.

'It
 won't be a very great headline if we get 8 million people connected to 
coverage, and we don't keep most of those folks connected to coverage a 
year from now or seven or eight months from now, ' she said.

A location the group said its had success signing people up in the past that it will continue recruiting people from ahead of the open enrollment period that begins in November is CVS, where it sets up tables on free health screening days.

City dwellers looking to avoid Obamacare recruiters need not avoid CVS for the foreseeable future, though. CVS will not hold any more free screenings until a date to be determined this fall.
