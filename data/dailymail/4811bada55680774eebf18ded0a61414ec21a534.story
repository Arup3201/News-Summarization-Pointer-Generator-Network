This is the moment a National Guard soldier surprised his wife and their one-day-old daughter after taking a last-minute flight from his post in the Middle East.

Sgt John Vorrath watched Janae give birth to their second child, Charlotte, in Ames, Iowa, from his unit using FaceTime on an iPad.

As he watched, his commander scrawled on a piece of paper that his request for leave had been accepted.

Surprise! Janae Vorrath was speechless when Sgt John arrived in her ward to greet their new baby daughter

Ecstatic: The couple were not sure how long it would be before John could meet his child for the first time

But he decided to keep schtum.

After hanging up the emotional call, Vorrath jumped straight on a plane - and 22 hours later he arrived at Mary Greeley Medical Center, the De Moines Register reports.

Janae was speechless.

In a YouTube video taken by their friend, John paced slowly into the ward where Janae was sat eating fruit and relaxing.

From a distance: John watched the birth using FaceTime on an iPad from his base in the Middle East

Special moment: The family posed for a photo together as Janae and Charlotte lay in bed in Ames, Iowa

Special permission: John's commander granted him permission for leave while he was watching the birth

Shock: He flew 22 hours to the hospital and cried as he hugged his wife and mother of his two children

Loving: John beamed as he picked up Charlotte, swaddled in a pink blanket, in awe of how tiny she is

The couple then clutch each other, crying, saying nothing.

Eventually, John tears himself away to give Charlotte the first hug from her father.

'She's so little!' he exclaims as Janae watches lovingly.

Surprise take two: Their two-year-old son Jet had no idea his father was coming home and looked shocked

Reunion: After he took a double take, Jet ran over to John for an embrace as his sister lay in her crib

Love: John, a member of Company C, 2nd Battalion, 147th Aviation, could not believe how big Jet was

The surprises didn't stop there: John, a member of Company C, 2nd Battalion, 147th Aviation, then waited for 15 minutes until the couple's two-year-old son Jet arrived.

The little boy looked confused then broke into a smile and ran at his father giggling.
