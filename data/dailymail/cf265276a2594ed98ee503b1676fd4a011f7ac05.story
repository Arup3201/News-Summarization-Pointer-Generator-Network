It is already used to share almost every aspect of our lives with friends.

But today, Facebook added a new feature, letting expectant parents share their good news with friends.

The new feature, which is available to all users who have switched to Facebook's 'Timeline' profile, lets users share their unborn child's name, expected birth date and gender.

Users can also choose who they want to share the information with, rather than telling all their friends.

Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan announced their wedding on the site. Now, the firm has added the ability for expectant parents to share their news via their timeline.

'Life Events are easy and expressive ways to mark significant moments in your life such as getting married, buying a house or traveling to new places,' said Facebook in a statement.

'If you choose to, you can now share that you are expecting a baby with your friends on Facebook.'

However, the firm said it has not ruled out using the service to target parents with adverts for baby-related good.

'Currently we are not using this life event for ad targeting,' said a spokesman.

'Weâ€™ll 
explore the option in the future, as we observe how people use the 
feature.'

However, some bloggers have pointed out the service could cause problems should there be problems with the pregnancy, or even is a miscarriage occurs.

'On the spectrum of touchy emotional moments, a miscarriage ranks pretty high,' wrote Rebecca Greenfield on the The Atlantic Wire.

'If you toggle the "Expected: Child" option, imagine how difficult it is to deal with that loss in public,'

Greenfield went on to cite a posting from
 an online community forum, in which a woman noted how difficult it was 
to receive messages inquiring about her pregnancy on Facebook after 
she'd lost her baby.

The move comes as Facebook is facing complaints from users about the amount of advertising on its site.

Yesterday the firm revealed it is to start testing a service that allows any firm to advertise on a user's timeline, rather than the current system which only allows firms the user has 'liked' to display adverts.

The new feature lets you share the news with close friends, selected friends or everyone.
