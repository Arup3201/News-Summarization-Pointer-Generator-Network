Traditionally, if you’re going on a date and are worried it might not work out, you’d ask a friend to call you with some sort of emergency.

Tickle app takes the hassle out of this by detecting when you feel uncomfortable and automatically making an urgent, but fake, phone call.

It uses the iPhone’s built-in accelerometer to pick up so-called ‘awkward’ movements, such as finger scratches or shakes, to work out you're in distress.

The Tickle app concept uses an iPhone's built-in accelerometer to detect movement.

When a user scratches or shakes the phone, in what the designers call an 'awkward' way, it triggers the Tickle app.

This generates a fake call that lets users escape awkward situations like dates or being stuck in lifts with colleagues.

Tickle's website claims the app is in private beta and will be released to the public 'soon.'

Interested users can also join a waiting list.

Tickle was created in San Francisco by designers Alex Cornell and Phil Mills.

At the moment the app is a concept, but Cornell told MailOnline he isn't ruling out the possibility of making it due to the response it has received.

‘Tickle was born at an awkward dinner,' explained the designers.

‘You know the one, where someone decided to invite 24 people and it came time to pay the bill.

'Rather than take another trip to the bathroom, we invented an app that lets you realistically escape any and all awkward situations you encounter.’

Tickle can either be turned on or off. Once it has been installed, the app is always ‘listening’ for signs of an awkward gesture or motion.

The fake caller can be customised with a photo and name of the user’s choice, but it doesn’t feature a fake conversation - Cornell and Mills said users will have to make that up themselves.
