This is the terrifying moment a reckless driver came within inches of causing a horrific three vehicle smash with a dangerous overtaking manoeuvre.

In the shocking footage an impatient motorist can be seen trying to squeeze past a slow moving lorry as another car approaches from the opposite direction.

The video, captured on the truckers dashboard camera, initially shows the heavy goods vehicle travelling along a narrow country road as a Vauxhall Vectra heads towards him.

Just as the vehicles appear to pass each other a white Peugeot 308 can be seen pushing into the small gap between them at high speed.

Dangerous overtake: This is the moment the impatient Peugeot 308 squeezed between the lorry and the Vauxhall Vectra travelling in the opposite direction. The image was captured at 15.57.43

Damage is clearly visible on the side of the 308 following the dangerous overtake in South Yorkshire. The image was taken at 15.57.43

The 308 careers into the side of the lorry, but narrowly avoids being deflected into the path of the Vectra. 

As it pulls in front of the heavy goods vehicle extensive crumple damage can be seen along its passenger side.

Its driver then pulls over to the side of the road before the short clip finishes.

The whole incident lasts just a matter of seconds. 

The near-miss was filmed in South Yorkshire in January last year on the lorry's dashboard camera.

Moments before the shocking overtake the lorry, which was travelling at around 30mph, had passed through what appears to be a small village. 

It was not known whether the driver of the Peugeot has been prosecuted for the harebrained overtake just before 4pm.  

The clip has only emerged after it was passed onto Simon Marsh, the managing director of camera maker, SmartWitness. 

He described the near-miss as one of the 'closest' he had ever come across.  

The businessman, who used to own a transport company with 200 vehicles tragically lost two employees in separate incidents on the roads.

"It's a miracle that there wasn't a three-way collision," he said.

"I've never seen a closer head-one near miss caught on our cameras and the actions of the driver of the Peugeot were crazy.

'Footage like this is vital in improving driver safety.'
