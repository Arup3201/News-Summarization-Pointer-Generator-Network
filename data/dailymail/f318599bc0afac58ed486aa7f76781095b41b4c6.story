The World Cup quarter-final and semi-final in 2006 were two of the biggest games of my career. 

I loved performing on the biggest stage as I knew I was a better goalkeeper under pressure. They are the matches when you know you have to deliver; that you must not fail. That is the case for France’s Hugo Lloris and Germany’s Manuel Neuer on Friday night. They, like me, will probably be nervous before the game but then the whistle blows and it is back to delivering. 

It’s a bigger challenge for Lloris than Neuer, as he has played fewer high-level games but the battle will be fascinating.

I’ll be supporting Germany, of course, but I have taken emotion out of it for this critical assessment of the two players.

MENTAL STRENGTH

LLORIS: He still has to prove his mental strength. With Tottenham, every time when it mattered, the team didn’t perform. And he hasn’t had many big challenges yet for France. But one big performance in a big game can make you a different player. You learn so much in these matches. 

NEUER: He’s mentally very strong because he’s been successful for such a big club in Bayern. You saw that in the Algeria game, where he came out of his box so many times. His timing was perfect and it shows real mental strength to act rather than react.

Something to prove: Lloris is yet to face a big challenge so far at this summer's tournament in Brazil

SHOT STOPPING

LLORIS: He is very good and agile. The only thing that  worries me is that his arms are skinny, like a lot of keepers these days. That has changed from my day and not for the better. 

NEUER: He has better, stronger arms. It can be the difference between clawing a ball off the line or it going in. The stronger your arms, the more likely you are to save powerful shots.

Brick wall: Neuer has strong arms making it more likely for him to save powerful shots at goal

DISTRIBUTION

LLORIS: He is left-footed and distributes well. He is very precise and better with that foot that Neuer is with either of his.  

NEUER: The German’s huge advantage is that he kicks with both feet and his distribution from his hands is the best in the world.

Go long! Neuer is capable of using both feet while Lloris is particularly precise with his left foot

PRESENCE IN THE AREA

LLORIS: He’s 6ft 2in but because he is skinny, he does not have a great presence. You often have to decide at the last second whether to punch or catch the ball but you need strong arms to be able to punch with both.  

NEUER: He could come more often for crosses because his huge frame makes him a big presence and he can dominate.

Flying high: Lloris climbs highest to punch the ball clear during France's last-16 victory over Nigeria

PENALTY SHOOTOUTS

LLORIS: I can rarely remember a shorter goalkeeper winning a shootout against a taller one. And of his 22 penalties faced in the past few years, he has saved only two. I won a shootout against Argentina in 2006 and two things were vital: the information I had on my opponents’ habits and timing my jump in the split second when it was obvious the taker could no longer change direction. 

NEUER: He lost the Champions League final against Chelsea - Germans are not supposed to lose penalty shootouts, I can say that as a German! But his armspan covers almost two thirds of the goal and he has saved 33 per cent of kicks since 2009

Success: Chelsea may have got the better of Neuer but the German has saved 33 per cent of kicks since 2009

KEEPER SWEEPER 

LLORIS: He is very quick off his line. He gets down to balls quickly because he’s not that tall and is very agile. When I failed to make a save, I used to wish I was smaller but I was wrong - making saves is just a small part of what you have to do as a keeper. 

NEUER: Showed against Algeria what he can do and has proved it again and again at a high level.

Sweeper Keeper: Neuer had to come to the aid of his back four during Germany's extra-time win over Algeria

VERDICT

Lloris wants to play at the top level, Neuer already does. This match-up is a man who is good against a man who is top-class.
