Blackman was the first British serviceman convicted of murder on active service abroad since at least the Second World War

The Royal Marine who executed a wounded Taliban prisoner will receive the same protection in prison as a convicted paedophile, it emerged yesterday.

The country’s top judge said the Ministry of Justice would be ‘aware’ of the threat to Sergeant Alexander Blackman from Islamic extremists and ‘take steps to minimise it’ as they did with child abusers.

But Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, defended allowing the disgraced 39-year-old commando to be named publicly because it was ‘very firmly’ in the interests of open justice.

Explaining the decision to lift an anonymity order on Blackman - known previously as Marine A - he said it would be wrong to conceal the identity of a convicted murderer.

The senior non-commissioned officer is serving at least ten years in a civilian prison for murder after being found guilty by a court martial last month.

Blackman shot the unidentified injured insurgent in the chest at close range with a 9mm pistol on September 15, 2011, then taunted him: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil.’

He told colleagues on the patrol from Juliet Company, 42 Commando: ‘Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.’

Harrowing film and audio of the killing were recorded on a helmet-mounted camera worn by a comrade.

Blackman, the first British serviceman convicted of murder on active service abroad since at least the Second World War, was finally named this month after losing a year-long legal battle to keep his identity secret.

Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Tugendhat and Mr Justice Holroyde, stripped the Marine of the anonymity granted during his court martial despite fears expressed by his legal team that he and his family would be targeted by Islamic terrorists.

Outlining the reasons for the decision, he said there was ‘the greatest public interest in knowing who he was and his background, given his conviction’.

He pointed out: ‘It would require an overwhelming case if a person convicted of murder in the course of an armed conflict were to remain anonymous.’

The judge said: ‘There is a risk to Marine A that he will be attacked in prison and after his release from what will have to be a life sentence.

‘The prison authorities will be well aware of that risk and take steps to minimise it, as they do for other offenders at risk of attack in prison such as paedophiles.

‘There is the threat assessed by the JTAC [Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre] to his family and to Marine A on his release under licence from his life sentence.

‘It is a known risk. The MoD has taken steps in the past to protect the families of the Marines. There is nothing to suggest that they would not do in the future.

‘Balancing those considerations, we have no doubt that the balance comes very firmly down on the side of open justice; the identity of Marine A must be made public.’

The anonymity of Blackman’s acquitted co-accused, known as Marines B and C, was lifted by the court, but will remain in place, pending the outcome of a possible appeal.

Blackman denied murder at a two-week court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, during which he was identified only as Marine A. He claimed he thought the insurgent was already dead.

He was sentenced to life in jail with a minimum ten-year term and dismissed with disgrace from the Royal Marines. He is considering whether to appeal against conviction and sentence.
