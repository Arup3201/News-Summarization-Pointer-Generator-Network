Ian Thorpe, the five-time Olympic swimming champion, is gay. He came out during an emotional interview with Sir Michael Parkinson broadcast in Australia on Sunday.

It turns out one of the most successful blokes in Australian sporting history likes other blokes. Whoever would have thought it?

I bumped into Thorpe at the BBC’s Olympic Park studio during London 2012. He was an excellent pundit — knowledgeable, respected and flamboyantly over the top in his enthusiasm.

Someone was complimenting presenter Gabby Logan on the handbag that was lying around the green room.

Bold announcent: Ian Thorpe revealed that he is gay during an interview broadcasted on Sunday

‘Oh that’s not Gabby’s,’ said the make-up lady. ‘It’s Thorpey’s.’

We all smiled. Of course it was.

The reaction to Thorpe’s interview has been similar: overwhelmingly positive and supportive, thank goodness, but underpinned by a shrug of the shoulders. Thorpe has not announced his sexuality, but merely confirmed what everyone thought they knew.

It’s more revealing that the 31-year-old had to wait until his competitive career was over to reveal the blindingly obvious. Thorpe claimed he was heterosexual as recently as his 2012 autobiography and only now, after battling depression, has he felt able to admit the truth.

A reported £220,000 incentive for joining Australia’s Channel 10, with the interview no doubt timed to attract maximum publicity just before the start of the Commonwealth Games, perhaps provided the final nudge. It is telling, though, that this acutely personal journey has taken so long to reach its  public conclusion.

Thorpe told lie upon lie until the web of deceit was too tightly spun for the truth to shine through.

‘What happened  was I felt the lie had become so big that I didn’t want people to question my integrity,’ he said.

‘A little bit of ego comes into this. I didn’t want people to question that... have I lied about everything?’

Thorpe’s hesitance to tell the truth is understandable. He was only 15 when he won his first World Championship gold medal and soon he was too famous and too deep in denials to go back on his word.

Don’t forget, he lives in a world where an Aussie rules commentator, Brian Taylor, feels able to use the phrase ‘big poofter’ on national television and then only offer a half-hearted apology at half-time.

No holds barred! The tell-all interview aired on Sunday on Australian channel Network Ten

Our default position to describe athletes who do decide to talk about their sexuality is still to call them ‘brave’ or ‘courageous’,  simply because they are still in the overwhelming minority. This is lazy and slightly patronising, because the many who remain silent are not weak, they are just more private individuals.

Athletes do not have a responsibility to talk about their sexuality; only an obligation to do their job to the best of their ability — by winning matches or medals or whatever it happens to be. 

They have to do whatever is best for them during their short careers. If that does not include pandering to public interest about their sexual orientation, then so be it.

Sport does, however, give athletes the opportunity and the platform to discuss their sexuality if they so wish; to become instant role models for youngsters who might be wrestling with the same feelings themselves.

Nobody is saying it will be easy, particularly for a young man or woman already dealing with the pressures of sporting fame and fortune.

Yet Thorpe turned down that chance, time and time again. He did not feel ready or able to seize it. The fact he finally has, after more than a decade as a public figure, makes it crass to simply shrug our shoulders and say ‘so what?’.

Overnight, Thorpe has become Australia’s most successful gay swimmer. Or, to put it a better  way, we can finally see Australia’s most successful swimmer in his true light.

A good get! 'Ian has always been near the top of my list to interview,' Parkinson said

American hurdler Queen Harrison, 25, provided not one but two of the best quotes of the Glasgow Grand Prix this weekend.‘Every time I race I go out there to have FUN, run FAST, and look FABULOUS!’ she said, adding: ‘I think the UK crowds love me because my name is Queen.’ Brilliantly bonkers.

Great Britain’s Under 20 basketball team progressed from the group stage of the European Championships for the first time — a huge achievement for a developing team sport shockingly bereft of  elite-level funding. Meanwhile, the Government is apparently too busy handing over £7.5m to help set up GB’s America’s Cup team to notice.
