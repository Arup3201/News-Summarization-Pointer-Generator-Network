Earth's two largest ice sheets are now dumping an 'incredible' 120 cubic miles of ice into the oceans each year.

This is equal to an ice layer 1,970ft (600 metres) thick that would stretch over an area half the size of London, researchers claim.

Overall, the rate of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet has doubled. Meanwhile the rate of volume loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has tripled since 2009.

The team has produced elevation models for the ice sheets. In Antarctica, the volume of ice loss is about 31 cubic miles (128 cubic km) per year and thinning is concentrated in the area of the Amundsen Sea

The discovery was made using the first ever maps of elevation changes in Greenlandic and Antarctic glaciers created by the Cryosat satellite.

A team at Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research used two years' of data collected by Cryosat in 2012 and 2013.

They were then able to build 14 million individual height measurements of glaciers for Greenland and another 200 million for Antarctica.

The maps reveal that Greenland is now losing about 90 cubic miles (375 cubic km) of ice each year.

In Antarctica, the volume of ice loss is about 31 cubic miles (128 cubic km) per year and thinning is concentrated in the area of the Amundsen Sea.

However, some thickening has been seen in the Dronning Maud Land, where colossal snowfalls have been reported.

The scientists claim, however, that this snow fall is not enough to offset the losses in West Antarctica.

'The contribution of both ice sheets together to sea level rise has doubled since 2009,' said Angelika Humbert from Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute.

'To us, that's an incredible number,' she told Jonathon Amos at BBC News.

CryoSat was launched in 2010 and uses a radar instrument to measure the shape of polar ice surfaces.

'The new elevation maps are snapshots of the current state of the ice sheets, added Dr Veit Helm, glaciologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute

In Antarctica, the volume of ice loss is about 31 cubic miles (128 cubic km) per year and thinning is concentrated in the area of the Amundsen Sea 

'The elevations are very accurate, to just a few metres in height, and cover close to 3.8 million miles2 (16 million km2) of the area of the ice sheets.'

Launched in 2010, CryoSat carries a radar altimeter that can 'see' through clouds and in the dark, providing continuous measurements over areas like Antarctica.

The radar can measure the surface height variation of ice in fine detail, allowing scientists to record changes in its volume with unprecedented accuracy.

'Although we are fortunate to now have, in CryoSat-2, a routine capability to monitor the polar ice sheets, the increased thinning we have detected in West Antarctica is a worrying development.' Said Professor Andrew Shepherd, of the University of Leeds.

'It adds concrete evidence that dramatic changes are underway in this part of our planet, which has enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than a metre [3.3 feet].'

A flourishing ecosystem has been found a mile and a half beneath Antarctic ice in a lake cut off from the outside world for millions of years.

The discovery was made by US scientists who found tiny organisms that generate energy for growth from the natural ammonium and methane in the environment.

This is the first direct evidence that life can be found deep below the Antarctic ice sheet and could have implications for finding life in extreme environments in our solar system.

'We were able to prove unequivocally to the world that Antarctica is not a dead continent,’ said lead scientist Professor John Priscu, from Montana State University.

Many of the organisms found belong to a primitive extended family of microbes, distinct from bacteria, called the Archaea. 

Archaea form one of the three great 'domains' of life on Earth, the other two being bacteria and eukayotes - organisms with their DNA contained in a cell nucleus - to which humans belong.
