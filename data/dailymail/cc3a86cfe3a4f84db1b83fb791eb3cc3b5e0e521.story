Thousands of secondary school children could be taught maths and science by teachers with no training in the subjects because of a recruitment crisis, an academic has warned.

Up to 30 per cent of places on postgraduate certificate in education maths courses due to start in September have not been filled.

Physics has also suffered a significant shortfall, along with modern foreign languages and English.

Numbers of applicants for teacher training in maths are down 709 on last year and in physics by 386 (file picture)

The lack of candidates is being blamed on growing confidence elsewhere in the jobs market and a squeeze on teachers’ pay.

It means more than 100,000 pupils could have classes with teachers who are not trained in the subject.

Numbers of applicants for maths are down 709 on last year and in physics by 386. Both are ‘national strategic priorities’ at A-level according to Education Secretary Michael Gove.

Design technology has shed 345 applicants and English 343, although the latter had a surplus last year.

Professor John Howson, of Oxford Brookes’ University, said the Government got ‘complacent after the recession’ as secondary school rolls fell and a ‘high spot’ of teacher retirements eased.

He said although lots of people wanted to study teaching at that point, due to job shortages elsewhere, ‘this was never going to last’.

Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders said there were ‘big gaps in recruitment’ particularly in science, technology, engineering and maths.

A Department for Education spokesman said there was no teacher shortage, adding: ‘This is scaremongering and based on incomplete evidence.’
