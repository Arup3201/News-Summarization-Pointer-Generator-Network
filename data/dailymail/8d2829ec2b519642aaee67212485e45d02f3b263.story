Most three year olds can't wait for summer so they can play outdoors for hours on end.

But for one little boy, being out in the sun causes his skin to blister and burn uncontrollably.

Eddison Miller has become one of the youngest people to be diagnosed with a rare and incurable genetic condition which makes him completely intolerant to all UV rays.

Eddison's parents Nicola and Andrew Miller try to keep his life as normal as possible, but every part of their son must be covered by UV-protective clothing when he ventures outside.

He must wear gloves and a hat with attached visor made of specialist film that covers his face, neck and shoulders and clothes specially selected to block UV rays.

Eddison was diagnosed with incurable genetic condition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) at three months old. The condition affects fewer than 1,000 around the world and means he is at an increased risk of getting cancer from sunlight

Eddison must be covered by factor 50+ sun block every three hours (he is pictured left and right playing in his protective suit). He also plays in his own specially-designed indoor garden when it's too bright outside

Eddison's body must also be covered by factor 50+ sun block every three hours and he plays in his own, specially-designed, indoor garden when it is too bright outside.

He suffers from xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a condition which means he could get cancer from sunlight.

His condition affects fewer than 100 people in Britain and about 2,000 around the world, but he is one of the youngest to be told he has the disorder.

Mrs Miller, from Kingsnorth, Kent, said their lives 'completely changed' after Eddison's diagnosis at just three months.

The 36-year-old, said: 'The condition affects every aspect of his life and we have to think of things that others would take for granted.

'People don't understand the everyday issues we have to consider. 

'We have to make sure Eddison isn't near to the door when the postman opens the letterbox and we have had to have an AC system installed because we can't open any windows in our house.

'But he is just a normal little boy. He loves getting messy in his sandpit, playing on his bike or with his little brother Raife.

'Our goal is just to help him live his life like a normal child.'

Eddison started displaying symptoms of being extremely sensitive to both natural and artificial light at just three months old.

Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) is a life-altering genetic condition characterised by an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays.

UV is in sunlight, most artificial lighting and even lightning. Unless patients with XP are protected from UV, their skin and eyes may be severely damaged and this can lead to cancer. 

XP is an extremely rare hereditary condition with less than 100 cases in the UK.

About 30 per cent of people with XP also develop neurological abnormalities which can include hearing loss and loss of mobility. 

There is no cure for XP, but much can be done to prevent and treat some of the problems it causes.

These include protection from UV, including total daylight avoidance, specialised clothing and sunscreens. 

People with XP must also undergo frequent skin, eye and neurological examinations and have prompt removal of cancerous tissue.

His eyes and skin were worst affected and he developed severe abnormal burns.

After initially assuming he was suffering from allergies a number of hospital visits and tests at St Thomas' hospital in London later revealed he had XP.

Eddison's family said that it was a common misconception that having XP simply meant keeping out of direct sunlight.

Mrs Miller, said: 'UV is present during all daylight hours and danger is still present indoors, with UV rays emitted by many sources of artificial lighting.'

She added that the family looks forward to the clocks going back.

'During the summer I calculated that Eddison and I spent less than 24 hours outside in six weeks so obviously that's an extremely challenging time of year,' she said.

'But the minute the clocks go back we get so much more time outside - it's wonderful.

'I know Eddison is going to face many challenges in his life but it is our job as parents to make sure he gets as much out of life as possible.'

Following the diagnosis Eddison's aunt Rebecca Stewart from Cushnie, Aberdeenshire set up a fundraising group called the Teddington Trust.

Overwhelmed by the support received by the Trust, Eddison's family decided they would build on its success and try and help others with the rare disorder.

Now they have launched their own set of teddy bears and books and hope their 'Little Ted' products can be sent to all the estimated affected 300 children in the world.

Mrs Miller, said: 'We looked for ways to help educate Eddison in understanding his condition, and we immediately looked for appropriate reading that might help us find the words to explain this.

'Eddison loved the initial story I wrote, and really engaged with it so before long I started thinking of further additions to this and a small series of 'Little Ted' stories emerged.

Eddison's parents say their goal is to help him live his life like a normal child. Here he is pictured with parents Nicola and Andrew and brother Raife

'We have set ourselves a goal to provide a copy free of charge to all children within our reach around the world affected by XP.'

The illustrator of the book, Michael Howdon, said: 'I feel very privileged to be a part of the Teddington project; it's fantastic to work on a book that will help children across the world, it has been a very rewarding experience.'

A spokesman for Parkers Design & Print, who are printing the book, added: 'Receiving the book and teddy that the Teddington Trust have so lovingly and expertly created from scratch, could make a massive impact on the children who suffer from XP and their supportive families.

'We feel very privileged to been a small cog in that wonderfully energetic process.'
