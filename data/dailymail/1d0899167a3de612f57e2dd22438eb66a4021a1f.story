British military ammunition is being used on the streets of Merseyside

British military bullets are being used by criminals on the streets of Merseyside as new figures reveal 18 guns and almost 2,000 bullets were lost or stolen from the Ministry of Defence last year.

Documents have revealed ammunition that can be identified as British military was responsible for 46 per cent of the bullets discharged in the Merseyside area between April and October 2012.

This comes as new figures show 18 firearms and almost 2,000 Ministry of Defence rounds of ammunition were lost or stolen last year.

The Times reported an internal army document as stating the availability of ammunition on Merseyside streets was good - evidenced by incidents where there were multiple bullets fired.

A former soldier also told the paper that army divers had recently discovered thousands of live rounds in a pond at a Northumberland firearms training area.

He said: 'At the end of a range session you have two official ways to dispose of ammunition.

'Either you've fired it so it's spent, or it has to be accounted for, signed back in and dealt with as fairly high-security stores.

'There is a third option where you dispose of it some unofficial way, either bung it in a pond or sell it to gangsters.'

However, Merseyside criminals are not the only ones benefiting from lost military firearms.

The number of British weapons recorded lost during the Afghanistan conflict reached double figures - with a spike of 57 automatic weapons lost and never recovered in 2010.

While no weapons were earmarked as lost or stolen during the conflict in 2006, that year more than 2,100 rounds of ammunition disappeared.

In December 2007, the Ministry of Defence revealed the gun used to shoot WPC Rachael Bown, 24, in the stomach in Nottingham in 2006 had been stolen from the Army.

The Browning 9mm pistol used in the attack had been stolen from a British military base or smuggled by troops from Afghanistan or Iraq and sold to thugs by a soldier.
