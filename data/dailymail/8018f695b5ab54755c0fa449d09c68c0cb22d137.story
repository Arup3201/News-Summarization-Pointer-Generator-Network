A 20-year-old student today said that she is unrepentant over an essay she wrote demanding that poor people stop making her feel bad because she's so rich. 

Rachael Sacks, who is enrolled in a $40,000-a-year writing program at a New York liberal arts school, ranted to MailOnline that she was undeserving of the attention because she is a 'spoiled brat who masturbates too much'.

Miss Sacks, published an essay on Thursday on Thought Catalog where she describes how a cashier at a grocery store close to her affluent West Village apartment was unfriendly and frowned at her because she was carrying a large shopping bag from the high-end designer Mulberry.

She blogged: 'I am sorry that I was born into great financial circumstances and my father likes to provide for me. I am sorry I don’t have to go to a state school to save my parents money. What do you want from me?'

'Unrepentant': Rachael Sacks, 20, addressed the furore over her essay today in front of her West Village apartment in New York Rachael Sacks

Miss Sacks defended her essay on the sidewalk outside her Manhattan home, a second-floor apartment in a pre-War townhouse, after the writing had attracted a wave of negative criticism online.

'Yes, let's all pity and feel bad for poor, judged, not smiled at,' one Twitter user remarked.

Another wrote: 'What a spoiled brat. Your parents did a 
horrible job of raising you. The level of entitlement in this article is
mind blowing. No one is born spoiled, entitled and snobby.' 

When asked if she had any regrets about the essay, Miss Sacks told MailOnline on Friday: 'No, I'm not repentant about what I said. I don't regret what I said.

'If people paid attention and realized what I was saying it's that you shouldn't shame people for what they are, what they have.

'I shouldn't have to pretend to be poor to make people like you, that's stupid. You should be who you are and other people should accept it.

'It's reverse elitism... to assume that people are going to try to relate to you for something they don't know, that you don't have the authority to understand the struggle, you don't have the authority to say that - so why would you pretend that you do?'

Miss Sacks continued: 'The criticism and the attention is stupid. I'm young, I'm irrelevant, why don't you care about other things?

'It must have been a really slow, horrible news day. I was looking at CNN too and all the stories recently have been really bad, something about some sea monster washing up on the beach in California. Why is this a number one story? Go and find something else.'

The 20-year-old admits that no one made a direct remark about her 'rich' status while she was picking up a snack at Gristedes store in the West Village following a designer shopping spree but added: 'They [cashier and another customer] made a whole thing, going through me and piecing together my life and who they think I am.' 

MailOnline
approached the store today but no one at Gristedes recognized a picture
of Miss Sacks or remembered the incident and were unable to comment 
further.

Scorned: Rachael Sacks, 20, has received endless online vitriol over her essay about privaledge

The slight on her character at the grocery store caused the
student to write an essay entitled I’m Not Going To Pretend That I’m Poor To Be Accepted By You.

She wrote: 'People shouldn’t make others feel bad about their 
own personal finances. How people spend their money is their own 
choice.

'It just seems really petty and makes you look bitter and unhappy with 
your own life if you are casting nasty glares at college girls in 
Gristedes because you’re a cashier.'

The 20-year-old then argues: 'I’m not one of those people who try to be poor to relate to people.

'I
think that’s honestly really disgusting behavior, it’s as if you’re 
saying that you have to make yourself into something you think is 
beneath you to get others to like you.'

Miss Sacks, who studies writing at the New School, was keen to talk about her future writing career.

She said: 'I've written books and stuff but basically I'm too young to actually figure that out. I think I'm interesting enough to have a memoir maybe.'

The student then added: 'But I'm a dumb, irrelevant, 20-year-old little b****. My friend said, "I think should write for the school newspaper because you don't want people to think you're a spoiled brat who masturbates too much."

'And I said, "Isn't that who I am?"'

She continued: 'People are not going to go and read some beautiful memoir anymore, it sucks. They want something stupid and light and gossipy and horrible and I could probably deliver on that.'

She acknowledged that 'probably' was 
what her article was. When asked if she was being shocking for the sake 
of being shocking, she responded: 'I believe in what I said but I do 
like shocking people a lot more and talking about things that people 
don't want to talk about.

'But
I believe everything I said. You shouldn't stigmatize people - they are
rich this is who they are, oh they are poor this is who they are.'

'She said it was obnoxious to label people in terms of their status, such as being 'poor' or 'homeless.

Miss Sacks attends the private Eugene Lang Liberal Arts College at the New School in Manhattan.

With tuition and fees totaling nearly 
$40,000 a year and annual cost of attendance estimated at more than 
$61,000, it has been ranked as one of the most expensive college in the 
country.

Her father is 
Dr Preston Sacks, a prominent fertility doctor in Maryland. 
The family lives in a $700,000 home in Bethesda.

Today, Miss Sacks revealed that she had been looking for a job for five years and had previously finished a 'grunt work' internship at Cityist magazine. She also is employed as a babysitter.

She was a little concerned that all the negative attention would affect her family, including her doctor father, but said they were 'mostly accepting of it'.

She said that she had discussed all the attention with her sister who is at home recovering from an illness. Miss Sacks said: 'I told my sister ''While you had lice, I became the most hated person on the Internet.'''

Miss Sacks claims that she had no idea
that she was rich while growing up because her family went to McDonalds
and she wore clothes from Old Navy.

She added: 'I went to private school when I was younger and there would always be someone so much richer than me.

'There
were kids who owned their own horses and whose parents were 
billionaires, so I had no idea that I had any money until I was about 14
and people called me ''Rachael Sacks of Cash''.

The
student has penned other articles entitled '13 Things That Should Exist
For New York Women In Their 20s' and 'Confession: I'm a chronic female 
masturbator'.

On her blog, her ambition is stated as: 'Working on my goal of being a rich eccentric old person by writing a lot of things.'

'That is a learned behavior. And it's 
repugnant. I hope that you can modify your behavior before you pass your
horrible and selfish attitude down to your children,' another commenter
adds.

Miss Sacks responded in fury at the negative responses her personal essay had drawn on Thursday.

She posted on Twitter: 'I've been dealing with b****** since the third grade I've always been ready for haterz.'

She adds: 'I'm just an obnoxiously loud voice of idiocy amongst billions.'

Gossip site Gawker piled on with a post headlined 'Rich Girl Not Going to Pretend She's Not Rich Just to Make Poors Happy.'

Despite the massive influx of online criticism, Miss Sacks doesn't appear to have changed her mind.

She tweeted: 'I'm rolling my eyes because I definitely don't deserve this much attention.'

Adding later: 'La la la everybody hates me guess ill eat some worrrrmmmsss. Suck it.'

Miss Sacks seems unrepentant in the face of criticism, telling her 'haters' to 'suck it'
