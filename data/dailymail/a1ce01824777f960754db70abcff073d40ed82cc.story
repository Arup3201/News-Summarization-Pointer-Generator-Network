A PE teacher has been banned from teaching for having sex with a 17-year-old student in a hotel room after a night out clubbing.

Luke Atkinson, 25, initially lied about taking her to the hotel room, but CCTV footage showed the two entering the premises together, a tribunal heard.

The girl, who is now aged 19 and cannot be named, reluctantly gave evidence against him by video link and refused to have him prosecuted.

Banned: PE teacher Luke Atkinson has been banned from the classroom for life after having sex with a 17-year-old pupil in a hotel room after a night out clubbing in Doncaster

Atkinson started working at Balby Carr Community Sports College, Doncaster, in 2010 but his career was left in ruins because of his one-night stand with the girl.

He was recommended for a five-year ban by a disciplinary body -
 but then Education Secretary Michael Gove over-ruled it and 
prohibited him from teaching indefinitely.

His downfall began on a Saturday night in June 2012 when the then 23-year-old met the teenage girl in The Priory nightclub in Lazarus Court, where she was out with a group of friends.

In the early hours he took her to a hotel room where they ‘engaged in sexual activity’, a misconduct hearing found.

After a disciplinary hearing in November that year, following a police investigation, he was sacked from Balby Carr.

The misconduct panel said the girl was a ‘very credible’ witness and found the allegation of engaging in sexual activity with her proven.

Atkinson
 did not attend the Professional Misconduct Panel of the National 
College for Teaching and Leadership in Coventry last month and his 
request for it to be heard in private was refused.

They also found Atkinson guilty of failing to co-operate with the police investigation into a safeguarding matter, and attempting to mislead those responsible for investigating the incident by lying about booking into the hotel.

The panel found his behaviour amounted to unacceptable professional conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute.

The panel recommended a prohibition order should last for a minimum of five years because the girl had engaged willingly in sexual activity and was above the age of consent at the time and it was an isolated incident which had not been pre-planned.

But Alan Meyrick, on behalf of the Education Secretary, said there was insufficient evidence that Atkinson had expressed remorse.

He added: 'Although he was a young teacher at the time, his behaviour was deliberate and he would have had no doubt that it was a serious breach of the standards that are expected of a teacher.

'His behaviour is so serious that a review period is not in the public interest.

'This means that Mr Atkinson is prohibited from teaching indefinitely... and shall not be entitled to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach.'
