The body of a county commissioner was found floating in a marina one mile from his home on an island off the coast of Georgia, with his hands bound and a gunshot to his head.

Police originally ruled the case a homicide but as the search for Tom Sublett's killer has now been going on for nearly one month, the prospect of it being a fully-staged suicide is now being seriously considered.

Though many aspects of the case- like the way his body was ditched, the fact the autopsy said he drowned rather than dying from the gunshot wound in his head, and the bloodstains in the trunk of his abandoned car- point to murder, many who knew Tom Sublett say that they have no idea who would have wanted him dead.

Family: Sublett is survived by his daughters Erin (left) and Leslie Sublett Gordy (right) as well has his two sons Grant and Reid

Mr Sublett, 52, was a married father of four and in the final months of his term as the County Commissioner.

He went missing on the night of Monday December 11, following his regular poker game at a friend's house in a town called Sterling, about a half hour drive from St Simons.

His wife became concerned when he hadn't arrived home by 2.30am and she called the friends that her husband had been playing cards with earlier in the evening.

One of the men drove along the route that Mr Sublett typically takes home from the games and he discovered the abandoned car at 4am.

Two hours later, another friend that was helping in the search checked the docks of the St. Simons Boating & Fishing Club. There he found Sublett's barely-visible body floating in the water.

Timeline: After leaving his poker game in Sterling, the drive should have only taken about 30 minutes to get back to his home on St Simons Island but he never returned

The marina is nearly one mile away from Mr Sublett's home, which real estate site Zillow values at $998,241.

Police chief Matt Doering told the Florida Times-Union that they have not found anyone who has seen Sublett in between 10.30pm Monday night when he left the poker game and the time that his friend found his body in the early morning on Tuesday.

Several key pieces of information have not been released by police.

They say that several personal items were missing from Mr Sublett's car but they have not disclosed what those items were. One thing they have ruled out is his wallet, however, as Mr Doering said that he was the one to collect that at the scene.

Transfers: Sublett (center right)- seen here with his daughter in law Kathryn Sublett (left), son Reid (center left), and younger son Grant (right)- was originally from Virginia but moved to St Simons Island in Georgia in the 1990s

Unexpected: The 52-year-old grandfather- seen here with Erin (left), Kathryn (center right) and Reid (right)- had no known enemies, making the search for any possible suspects more difficult

Friends and colleagues are shocked that anyone would want to murder the mild-mannered realtor-turned-local official, adding to speculation that perhaps it was suicide.

Because of that possibility- which other friends dismiss out of hand, saying that there were no signs that Mr Sublett was depressed or had any intention of killing himself- people are curious about the angle of the shot.

Work: Mr Sublett was resigning as a county commissioner in the coming months to spend more time working on his real estate business

If Mr Sublett shot himself while his hands were bound, the bullet would have likely come from the bottom of his head, closer to his chin, as opposed to if he was shot by someone standing perhaps above him.

Another problem for police: they still haven't found the gun.

'You name it... there are all sorts of theories,' local resident Elden Carmichael told The Atlanta Journal Constitution.

As the search for a suspect is about to be one month old, investigators are beginning to look more closely at signs that the death could have been staged.

One of the things they are revealing to have found in the abandoned car was an empty bottles of prescription medication that belonged to Mr Sublett and his wife.

They are still waiting on toxicology reports to determine whether or not Mr Sublett had ingested any of the pills, as a suicide would be more likely if he had taken some of those drugs before killing himself.

The obvious signs prompted police to rule the case a homicide immediately after Mr Sublett was found. That has produced few leads, however, as no friends can suggest no possible enemies for Mr Subless who they called a 'jokester'.

His wife Carol has not spoken publicly since the incident and neither have his four children- his daughters Kathryn and Erin and sons Grant and Reid. He is also survived by two grandchildren.

He is also known for being honest and willing to compromise when it came to his work.

The Commission chairman Richard Strickland said to the Florida Times-Union that Mr Sublett 'was probably one of the greatest community leaders I can recall' and also counted him as a 'good friend and a great family man'.

The only contested decision that investigators have looked into from his time as commissioner was one to fight a proposed jail expansion.

Mr Sublett was against the idea of building a new jail in Brunswick, which is just on the mainland and not far from St. Simons Island, and though the debate was heated according to The Atlanta Journal Constitution, his side did win in the end and the jail was built elsewhere.

As the case is still officially ruled a homicide, some of Mr Sublett's colleagues fear that they may be next.

'All the commissioners have had a second thought about this thing,' fellow commissioner Bob Coleman told the Journal Constitution.

'I try not to get myself backed up in a corner somewhere. I avoid dark parking lots. When I walk outside my business, I look both ways.'
