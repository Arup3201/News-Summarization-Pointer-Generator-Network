'Revenge': Bryn Chittenden, 46, had his attempts to build a barn on his field repeatedly blocked due to opposition from neighbours

A man who claims his neighbours have made his life 'hell' is threatening to exact revenge by selling his field to travellers.

Bryn Chittenden, 46, says his attempts get planning permission for a barn on his field in Essex have been blocked time and again due to opposition from residents living on a nearby estate.

Now the bitter former print manager intends to sell the 20-acre plot to gypsies, sparking fears the site in St Lawrence Bay could become 'a new Dale farm'.

Mr Chittenden has said he would not sell the land to any of his neighbours for 'a million pounds', but would accept a fraction of that amount for the 'satisfaction' of seeing gypsies move in.

He warned residents on the neighbouring Scarletts estate: 'If you think I'm a problem, wait 'till a hundred travellers turn up in their caravans'.

Mr
Chittenden, a terrier man for the Essex Farmers and Union Hunt, has 
advertised the sale online and even told residents he plans to take out a 
full page advertisement in a quarterly magazine aimed at gypsies and 
travellers.

Much of the row 
has been played out on Facebook, with Mr Chittenden making his threats 
on a local community page for the St Lawrence Bay area.

He warned: 'The land will also 
be advertised outside of Facebook, including a full page advert in the Travellers’ Times, a magazine for gypsies and travellers which I doubt
many of you will get.

'I have
had a couple of offers for the land already but some things in life are
more important than money so I will end up taking less just for the 
satisfaction of watching travellers take over,' he said.

Exasperated: Mr Chittenden has now said he intends to sell 20 acres of his land in St Lawrence Bay, Essex, to travellers

Mr Chittenden's plans have left residents living on the Scarletts estate afraid the land could end up resembling the notorious Dale Farm, the six acre plot in Crays Hill that was Europe's largest illegal traveller camp until residents were evicted in 2011.

'It's a real concern because by publishing the land on the internet and in traveller magazines there's a real chance that people will turn up and start to live on the land illegally,' said one woman from the estate, who did not want to be named.

'Once they get here it is almost 
impossible to get them to move on. It’s happened here before and it’s 
happened in Essex many times.

'We don’t want to live next-door to another Dale Farm.'

But Mr Chittenden, who bought the site five years ago for £100,000, insists he will the land to his neighbours at any price.

'I’ve never wanted to develop the land. I just want to graze some animals there,' he said.

'But
every time I try and do anything with the land they oppose any changes.
They have made my life hell and now I will sell it to travellers.

'Even
if they offered me a million pounds I would not sell it to them. But if
travellers offered me £100,000, it’s all theirs,' he said.

The land is designated as agricultural, and since the row erupted Maldon District Council has plastered posters around the site warning against attempting to park caravans in the field.

The orange posters state 'the stationing of caravans without planning permission' is banned, as is 'motor car and motorcycle racing' and the stationing of 'any moveable structure' without planning permission.

A spokesman for Maldon District Council said: 'The landowner can sell his land to whoever he wants.

'But we are clear this is agricultural land and it is clear what it can and cannot be used for.'
