The boys of Team Europe celebrated their astonishing Ryder Cup victory on Sunday with lots of hugs and plenty of Champagne.

After stunning the Americans by clawing back five points on the final day of play, the golf superstars hammed it up in front of the camera at the awards ceremony at Medinah Country Club near Chicago, Illinois.

Rory McIlroy, who arrived to his match-up with just ten minutes to spare, poked fun at his time zone mix-up by wearing a giant clock around his neck as he chugged a massive bottle of Champagne.Â

Deep in the revelry was Germany's Martin Kaymer, who ensured the Europeans could not be beaten on Sunday evening when he defeated Steve Stricker with a six-foot putt to give the visitors a 14-13 lead.

Tiger Woods later locked in an American loss with a missed putt from inside four feet, to 
halve his match with Francesco Molinari. The Europeans finished with 14 
1/2 points while the Americans had 13 1/2.

Woods and Stricker, the anchors in the lineup, didn't win a single match at Medinah.

'This one is for all of Europe,' Europe coach Jose Maria
Olazabal said.

The Europeans wore the image of Seve 
Ballesteros on their sleeves and played their hearts out Sunday at 
Medinah to match the greatest comeback in history and head home with 
that precious gold trophy.

Europe got its payback for Brookline. Martin Kaymer gave German golf redemption for Kiawah Island.

Celebration: Kaymer wrapped himself in a Gernan flag and wildly celebrated his victory at Medinah Country Club near Chicago

No, they couldn't: This clever bit of skywriting -- President's Obama's slogan for a tournament in his home town -- was not enough to propel the Americans to victory

'Seve will always be present with this team. He was a big
factor for this event for the European side, and last night when we 
were having that meeting, I think the boys understood that believing was
the most important thing. And I think they did.'

Ian Poulter was the first to embrace Olazabal, which was only fitting.

It was Poulter who gave Europe hope Saturday evening when he made five 
straight birdies to turn a loss into a win and swing momentum in 
Europe's favor. Poulter was up to his fist-pumping, eye-bulging tricks 
again on the final day, winning the last two holes in his match against 
U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson.

Sealed: German Martin Kaymer ensured Europe could not be beaten in the tournament when he sank a five-foot putt for par on Sunday

It's good! Kaymer carefully lined up his putt before the successful shot on the 18th hole on Sunday

And he had plenty of help. Europe's top five players in the lineup all 
won, including Rory McIlroy, who was lucky to be playing.

McIlroy kept 
thinking his match was at 12.25pm -- it was listed in Eastern time, 
not Central -- and he needed a police escort to get to the course with 10
minutes to spare. Then, he came up with key birdies to hand Keegan 
Bradley his first loss of the week.

The biggest match might have belonged to Justin Rose. He was on the 
verge of losing to Phil Mickelson when Rose holed a 12-foot par putt to 
halve the 16th, made a 35-foot birdie putt from the back of the 17th 
green to win the hole, and then closed out Mickelson with a 12-foot 
birdie on the last hole.

Six of the 12 matches went to the 18th hole on Sunday. The Americans won only one of them.

The Americans also rallied from a four-point deficit to win in 1999 at 
Brookline. This was different, though. The Americans won big in those 
early matches. At Medinah, so many of them could have gone either way.

Dropped: Tiger Woods missed a putt from inside four feet, losing his match to Italian Francesco Molinari, resulting in Europe winning the tournament outright

Loss: This is the moment Tiger missed his putt and sealed a win for the Europeans

It was so close, so tense, that either side could have won the Ryder Cup down to the very end.

Stricker made an 8-foot par putt on the 18th, and Kaymer faced a par 
putt from 6 feet to win the match. If he missed, the Americans would get
a half-point, and Woods was leading 1-up over Molinari and in the 
middle of the 18th fairway.

Kaymer, a former No. 1 and major champion who has struggled all year, poured it in the middle and the celebration was on.

Late: Rory McIlroy showed up in the nick of time

No 1: McIlroy overcame a strong challenge from Keegan Bradley

'It's a feeling I never had before,' Kaymer said. 'On Friday, I sat down
with Bernhard and talked a little bit about the Ryder Cup because my 
attitude was not the right one. But now I know how important the Ryder 
Cup is.'

He could barely speak at this point, not so much from pure emotion but 
having to scream over the crowd behind him. Players were hugging and 
crying, and the small European contingent that had been drowned out all 
week was serenading themselves with what has become the theme song of 
the Ryder Cup.

'Ole, ole, ole, ole,' they sang merrily, even as the teams prepared for the closing ceremony.

Europe now has won seven of the last nine Ryder Cups, and even more 
remarkable about this comeback is that they did it on the road.
