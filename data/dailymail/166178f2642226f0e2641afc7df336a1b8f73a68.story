Roy Hodgson is confident in Harry Kane's ability to shine for England, it is just a case of whether there is space for him in the upcoming squad.

This has been quite the season for the 21-year-old, whose 24 goals in all competitions is far and away the best tally from any English striker this term.

That form has impressed Three Lions boss Hodgson, who has strongly hinted recently that Kane will earn a first senior call-up in two weeks' time.

It is not just the Spurs man vying for a striking berth, though, with a number of other in-form, uncapped players hoping to be involved against Lithuania and Italy.

Saido Berahino, Danny Ings and Charlie Austin have all impressed for their clubs this season - but it is Kane who is the main talking point.

'He's in my thoughts of course, he deserves to be,' Hodgson said, speaking at the London Football Awards, which raises funds for national charity, Willow.

'He's scoring goals for one of our top teams in the Premier League but I know him anyway, he's done a lot of good work for the Under-21s.

QPR's Charlie Austin (left) and West Brom's Saido Berahino (right) have both been in fine scoring form 

'What pleases me most is young players are getting their chance to play. In the past 19, 20, 21-year-olds would be loaned out or would have to sit back and wait for their chance. Now more and more of them are taking the chance when they get it.

'I'm delighted for him and we'll see when I select my squad at the end of month if he's in it.' Asked whether Kane was ready to make the step up to the senior side, Hodgson said: 'He's ready. If he wasn't ready he wouldn't be playing for Tottenham and scoring lots of goals.

'The question you ask is has the player got the quality and talent we're looking for and is there a space for him?

'If he comes in then someone's going to drop out and most forwards we've got have done quite well in the autumn.

'But I can't include everyone unfortunately. It's not always a question of are they good enough, it's a question of is there space at this time.'

However Kane is the one gaining all the attention having scored 24 goals in all competitions this season

Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck look set to be involved in the squad, while Rickie Lambert and Jermain Defoe are other experienced forward options when the national team reconvene after a four-month break.

'I am looking forward to it, we all are,' Hodgson said. 'Certainly I and my coaching staff are. I hope the players are looking forward to it, too.

'It will be nice to see them again. We did plan a little meeting in January but we found another way of staying in touch with them.

'It will be nice to see them physically again and I hope to see them in as good a shape as I thought they were last autumn.'
