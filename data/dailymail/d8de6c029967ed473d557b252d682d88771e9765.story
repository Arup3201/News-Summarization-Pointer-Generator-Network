West Bromwich Albion are facing the prospect of losing further sponsors, depending on the outcome of the Football Association's investigation into Nicolas Anelka's 'quenelle' gesture.

The Black Country club counts German clothing company Jack Wolfskin among its partners and the firm has issued a statement in which it does not rule out the possibility of ending its backing.

Gesture: Anelka is to discover his fate after an FA investigation into his goal celebration at West Ham

Tackle: Anelka has asked the FA to drop the charges for his quenelle gesture in December

So far this week, property company Zoopla, West Brom's club sponsors, have confirmed they will be finishing their £3m-a-year deal with the club at the end of the current campaign.

And now Marvin Troemer, a corporate communications spokesman for Jack Wolfskin, said: 'We are following the developments closely but has no decision has been taken yet.

'The FA is waiting for a statement of Nicolas Anelka before coming to a final judgment. We consider the charges as serious and strongly disapprove of any gestures or statements which are meant to discriminate a single person or a certain group of people.

'We are now awaiting the judgment of the Football Association before taking further steps.

'And depending on what our partner West Brom says, which measures they will take and considering our legal possibilities (contract) we would also consider to end our sponsorship as one option.'

'Zoopla
 pay £3million to sponsor West Bromwich Albion. That gives them the 
right to spoil the famous striped shirts a little, but not to pick the 
team.'

One other sponsor, Holler Watches, have also admitted to monitoring the events at the Hawthorns after Zoopla's announcement earlier in the week.

Zoopla.co.uk is a property website and is part of the Zoopla Property Group Ltd, a privately held company whose shareholders include DMG Media, a division of DMGT plc, the company which owns the Daily Mail and MailOnline.

Anelka meanwhile has until 6pm on Thursday to ask for a personal hearing following the charge that he made an improper gesture that was an aggravated breach as it included 'a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief.

In a new post on his Twitter feed, the 34-year-old has written 'Rien a ajouter', which when translated reads 'Nothing to add'. Pertinently, Anelka includes a link to a video clip on Le Figaro that shows an interview with Roger Cukierman, president of Crif, the council representing French Jewish institutions.

In the short 40-second segment, Cukierman claims Anelka's gesture was not anti-Semitic and that he should not be heavily punished. The FA have the power to sentence him to a minimum five-match ban.

Cukierman said: 'It seems a bit severe to me because it seems to me that this gesture only has an anti-Semitic connation if the gesture is made in front of a synagogue or a memorial to the Holocaust.

'When it's made in a place which is not specifically Jewish it seems to me that it's a slightly anarchic gesture of revolt against the establishment, which doesn't deserve severe sanctions.'

No more: West Brom announced the that Zoopla would not extend their contract with the club

Other pressure groups, however, have called for Anelka to be handed more than a five-game suspension due to his lack of an apology.

Jonathan Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: 'I know under the rules that on a first-time offence there is a minimum five-game suspension.

'But I think what he did was sufficiently serious to justify a longer suspension than five matches.

'He has not indicated one bit of remorse or regret or apologised for his actions.

'He has simply said he wouldn't do it again and that is not good enough.'

After
 scoring in West Brom’s 3-3 draw at West Ham, striker Nicolas Anelka 
celebrates by making the quenelle — an inverted Nazi salute created by 
his friend, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M’bala M’bala — 
which has anti-Semitic connotations.

The
 gesture is relatively unknown in the UK but there is an angry reaction 
in France with the country’s sports minister calling Anelka’s actions 
‘disgusting’.

Headline: Martin Samuel called for Anelka to be kicked out for the gesture

December 29

Anelka
 says on Twitter: ‘I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic. The meaning of 
quenelle is anti-system. I do not know what religion has to do with this
 story. With regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations 
of my quenelle, they are the ones that create confusion.’

The
 FA begins investigating the incident while Sportsmail’s Martin Samuel 
calls for Anelka to be banned for knowingly bringing an anti-Semitic gesture to a wider audience.

The FA reveal that they are working with an ‘appointed expert’ as part of their investigations into  Anelka’s quenelle. But the delay in making a decision is widely criticised.

West
 Brom’s shirt sponsors Zoopla threaten to end their £3million deal 
unless Anelka is axed. They say they will remove the Zoopla name from 
the home shirts if he is picked for the next match.

Just hours before Monday’s
 kick-off against Everton, Zoopla, who have sponsored West Brom since 
2012, announce that they will not renew their deal with the club at the 
end of the season as a result of Anelka’s gesture.

When
 West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in 
Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a
 gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football.

But
 the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a 
fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and
 stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland.

Here,
 we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of 
its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political 
activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala:
