A baby boy whose favourite word was 'bath' drowned after being left alone at bath time when his mother became distracted by household chores.

Paul Carter-Young, aged 21 months, got into difficulties at the family home in Rossendale, Lancashire, as he splashed about in the tub and popped water balloons unsupervised.

His mother Kelly Young, 36, had been distracted folding clothing and sheets and talking to another of her four children in an adjoining room when the tragedy occurred in April.

Paul Carter-Young (pictured) was 21-months-old when he drowned at his family home while playing with his toys and water balloons in the bath unattended as his mother folded sheets and clothes in a different room

An inquest heard how detectives investigated the incident but were content that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and that the youngster had been 'absolutely loved' by his parents

She found her son face down in the water when her youngest daughter raised the alarm.

Paramedics were called to the family's £300,000 detached home but the youngster was pronounced dead on arrival at Royal Blackburn Hospital.

An inquest heard how detectives investigated the incident but were content that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and the boy had been 'absolutely loved'.

They concluded Miss Young and her company director partner Paul Carter, 54, led a 'quite a hectic' family life with four children and were 'beside themselves' over their son's death.

The toddler had been nicknamed 'Dragon' by the family because he was born in the Chinese year of the mythological creature and loved baths and water.

The hearing was told he had been born weighing 5lbs 3oz and with a cleft lip but had surgery at three months old and smiled a week later. He had two sisters, Imogen, 14, and Amelia, and an older brother.

The youngster was found face down in the bath at the family's £300,000 family home (above) in Rossendale, Lancashire, on April 10. He was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival

In a statement Miss Young, who was excused from attending the Burnley hearing, said: 'He never cried, he was so strong. Imogen did everything for him. He would whinge and she would tell me what he wanted.'

She added that his favourite word was 'bath' and that he would like to pop water balloons while being washed.

The inquest heard how the tragedy occurred on April 10 when Miss Young ran a bath for her two youngest children - the toddler and his sister Amelia.

Young Paul sat in the bath with his toys and jugs but Amelia had not wanted to get in.

Miss Young added: 'We have always had a busy, noisy house. He would love the bath. Dragon always had to be put in the water with jugs and toys. I went to get Amelia, I didn't know why she didn't want to get in. I went to the landing.'

She added that she went to look in the bathroom and heard the balloons popping before going to her bedroom and talked to eldest daughter Imogen. She began folding up clothes while shouting for Amelia to get into the bath.

Still hearing balloons popping, the inquest heard that Miss Young's other daughter then came in and began talking to her.

She then said she heard Amelia say: 'Mummy Dragon'.

In her statement Miss Young added: 'I ran to the bathroom, everything happened very quickly. Dragon was face down in the bath. I scooped him up and held him in my arms, patting his body. I told Imogen to take Amelia away and shouted for Paul to come up.'

The youngster was put in the recovery position and his parents attempted resuscitation causing the boy to be sick.

Miss Young then ran to a neighbour who was a trainee nurse and banged on the window before returning to the house.

The statement read that Miss Young was unable to go up the stairs adding, 'I can't do when my kids get hurt, I just want to run away.'

She added that when she saw paramedics carrying him down the stairs she thought he was going to be okay before her partner called her from the hospital to tell her the news.

She added that she took the youngster's dragon pyjamas to the hospital and told him: 'I'm sorry'.

Pathologist Naomi Carter was unable to say how long the boy had been under the water.

In a statement read out at the inquest, Dr Carter said: 'Death is consistent with having drowned. It is not assessable to say how long he was under the water. Bubble bath and large toys may have put him at an increase of slipping.'

Detective constable Leanne Lyons, of Lancashire Police, said Miss Young had been 'beside herself ' and had 'thought he would be okay'.

She told the inquest that the couple had been left devastated.

She said: 'They were blaming themselves, a very natural thing to do. They were distressed, blaming themselves and then supporting each other.

'They had quite a hectic family life. From the offset there was no inconsistency. They understood why I was there. Like in most households bath time can quite easily get out of hand.

'I was quite happy with the explanation that was given at the time. Both the mother and father were clearly devastated. She talked quite openly about how Dragon loved water whereas she had a fear of water and was wary of it.'

East Lancashire coroner Richard Taylor said he understood why Miss Young hadn't wanted to attend the inquest and returned a conclusion of accidental death.
