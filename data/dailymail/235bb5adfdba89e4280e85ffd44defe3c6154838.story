Former Liverpool loanee Nuri Sahin has lifted the lid on his short stint at Anfield, claiming he had to leave because Brendan Rodgers refused to play him in the correct position.

Sahin joined Liverpool for six months between August 2012 and January 2013, scoring three times in his 12 appearances.

Now at Borussia Dortmund, Sahin explains the reasons behind his swift exit from the Premier League.

Sahin revealed that Brendan Rodgers was insistent on playing him behind the striker at Liverpool

'I went to Liverpool because of my love for the Premier League,' the 26-year-old told TRT.

'After scoring a few goals the manager started playing me behind the striker which does not suit my game. 

'Despite my love for the club and the fans, I had to leave due to the managers insistence on playing me in that role.'

The Turkish international joined Dortmund, the club at which he played for six years between 2005 and 2011, from Real Madrid in a £6 million summer move.

He has a total of 22 goals and 44 assists in 218 appearances for the German side.
