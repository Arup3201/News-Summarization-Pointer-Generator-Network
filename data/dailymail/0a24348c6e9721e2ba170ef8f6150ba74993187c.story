Jason Chan, a cancer survivor and Chicago restaurateur, sought sweet justice for one of his patrons last Thursday evening.

Jason Chan, who is also a martial arts instructor and former bouncer, won an epic battle against a thief who tried to steal a customer's I-phone 5.

Chan says he saw a suspicious man wearing ripped clothing walk into the restaurant --too messy an ensemble to be dining in a Michelin rated sushi restaurant like Juno in Chicago, Ill.

The thief, Justin Ballog, removed his coat and put it on the bar. He then asked the bartender for a pen and paper and sped out the door a few moments later.

Chan noticed customer Gary Wolske's phone was no longer at the bar. After Wolske confirmed his phone was missing, Chan was out the door after the culprit.

Chan got into his car and scoured the streets for the man in the red and black striped sweater. He saw him walking into nearby Lou Manalti's Pizzeria about to try the same trick.

Chan confronted Ballog, 37, who threatened Chan with violence.

'He was adversarial, [so I used] hand-to-hand combat techniques to make sure he was unconscious,' Chan told the Chicago-Sun Times.

Ballog was no match for the martial arts master who teaches Shidokan and who has been practicing the art for 19 years.

Chan told ABC, 'He got into an aggressive stance with me, and I said, 'Don't try to hit
 me, if you try to hit me, I'm going to defend myself,' and then I said 
'Don't even think about hitting me,'and then he tried to hit me,' said 
Chan.

Chan told the Huffington Post, 'I have a protective nature I guess.'  

Chan also said, 'I grabbed him and threw him into the door.'

Passersby witnessing the flight in the street called police.

'I put him in a maneuver called an arm bar and told him I would break his arm if he tried to get away,' said Chan.

When police arrived, they arrested Justin Ballog of the 5000 block of North California, Chicago. He was charged with misdemeanor theft. 

And he's modest! Jason Chan thanks everyone for their support in his act of trying to help someone in trouble

Juno regular, Wolske, was beyond grateful for Chan's help in getting back his phone. In order to thank Chan, Wolske bought him a 12-year-old Glenlivet Scotch on Friday.

'He’s like the modern-day John Wayne, or Bruce Lee. . . . He takes it to heart: What’s right is right,' said Wolske.

Wolske told the Sun Times that he won't be leaving his phone on a bar ever again. He is thankful for Chan's courageous actions.

'It does send a message: This tough guy, Jason, and his neighbors are not going to allow this,' Wolske said.

This fight was the first time Chan used Shidokan outside the gymnasium in over a decade.

ABC Chicago reports that Jason Chan also just won a battle against throat cancer. Chan, who was diagnosed in January 2012, didn't have health insurance so dedicated friends helped him by starting a fundraising campaign to pay for stage four cancer treatment.

Jason Chan is now cancer free, but has since lost 50 pounds and is still recovering from chemotherapy.

'To have these health issues and to be able to do this is amazing,' said Wolske.

Chan said he hoped thieves would avoid his neighborhood and establishment. He told ABC that he has had years of training, is a black belt, and that others should not try to interfere with crime unless they can properly defend themselves.
