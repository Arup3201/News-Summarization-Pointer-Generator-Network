Drones have become the latest must-have tools for security forces across the world, providing a watchful eye in the sky.

But a team of engineers could extend the vehicles' watching brief - developing a claw-like leg that would allow drones to snatch objects while in flight.

Engineers at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia based their design on the bald eagle, replicating the bird's ability to clutch fish from water while in flight.

Snatch: Engineers at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia have developed a grabbing arm that can be attached to a drone

Inspiration: The team based their design on the bald eagle's ability to snatch fish from water mid-flight

Grabbed: An arm attached to the drone is able to lag behind the vehicle's centre-point, like an eagle's legs

The gripping device, comprising three talon-like arms, has been tested on a tiny unmanned aerial vehicle.

Situated on the end of a attached leg, the claw can drag slightly behind the drone's centre of mass - much like an eagle's legs as it flies - allowing the path of flight to continue uninterrupted.

The scientists noticed that the slight delay and detachment from the eagle's body meant it had an extra split-second to effectively grab objects.

At another Philadelphia university software is being developed that hopes to stabilise drones with arms while in flight.

Swoop: The arm allows the drone to clutch the item without stalling its flightpath

Tool: Drones have become an increasingly popular piece of machinery for security forces across the world

Grip: The gripping device, comprising three talon-like arms, has been tested on a tiny unmanned aerial vehicle

The team at Drexel University hope the software will allow drones to pick up objects without seriously affecting flight, by redistributing the weight.

The software could be used to allow drones to pick up medication, use hand tools and even prune trees.

Developer Christopher Korpela told the New Scientist: 'A UAV with arms could perform the same tasks as a ground robot, but with a three-dimensional workspace.

'It will be a while before flying robots 
with arms and legs find their way into wider use, though. "We still have
a long way to go to develop aircraft capable of safely interacting with
people or the environment.'
