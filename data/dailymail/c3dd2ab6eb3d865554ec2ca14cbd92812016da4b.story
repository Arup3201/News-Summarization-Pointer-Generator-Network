Forget generic greetings and winter landscapes, one interfaith couple has found a clever way to mark their separate religious beliefs in one colorful holiday card.

San Francisco's Scott Burry and Dani Vernon have combined the traditions of their respective Christian and Jewish faiths which has delighted their friends and family.

'We wanted to do something fun and something light, and we hadn't done anything like this together before,' Burry, 27, told MailOnline.

'The card is less 
about the ceremonial aspects and more...about how can we celebrate together as a family. The card is about where we come from.'

Merry Chrismukkah! Interfaith couple Scott Burry and Dani Vernon combined their holiday traditions in one greeting card

On the left side of the inclusive card, Burry stands in front of a fake Christmas tree and a mountain of presents holding the couple's beloved pooch, Tucker.

To his right stands Vernon, 27, with a Star of David and the Chanukkah candles against a blue background.

Although the 'Chrismukkah' card is split down the middle, the couple insist they share each other's religious traditions.

'I don't know that we were trying to make a statement,' Burry said.

'Dani's family is this large Jewish 
family and I have assimilated into that for the last four years. And we 
also celebrate Christmas together. We all share our faith.'

Team effort: The couple decked out a studio at Left Space photography studios in San Francisco for the shoot using a few cheap props, wallpaper and a fake Christmas tree

Burry said a group of friends helped him and Vernon set up the shoot at Left Space studios in San Francisco last month.

They bought some cheap decorations and bright wallpaper to deck out the bare studio, holiday-style.

The couple, who have been dating for about four years, sent the card out to family and friends just before Hanukkah ended on December 5. They loved it.

'Our families were super excited...and totally stoked,' Burry said. 'Dani's parents were basically laughing and they asked for more. We got a lot of texts and messages from people saying 'Best card ever!' '

But now, Burry said, the pressure is on to come up with something bigger and better next year.

'We already have the wheels in motion,' he said. 'They're very preliminary ideas, but there is the possibility of a sleigh being pulled by 12 photoshopped images of our dog Tucker.'

However, it shouldn't be too difficult for the creative pair, who met at San Francisco State University.

Burry is a photographer, whose work can be found online at scottburryphoto.com.

Vernon works as an assistant photo editor, and her photos can be seen at danivernonphoto.com.
