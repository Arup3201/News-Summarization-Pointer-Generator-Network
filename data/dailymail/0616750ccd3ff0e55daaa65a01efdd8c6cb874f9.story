You could be forgiven for doing a double-take if you spotted this wonderdog hopping out for a walk.

The five-month-old has got just two legs – but takes a kangaroo-like approach to getting around.

Her bouncing and jumping has earned her the name Roo, as well as plenty of attention from confused passers-by who mistake her for a marsupial.

The plucky puppy, who was rescued from Romania, is thought to have been born with one front leg missing before suffering the loss of the other soon afterwards.

She was saved from certain death by British charity Safe Rescue for Dogs, and had already learned to bounce with kangaroo-like ease when they brought her to the UK in November.

Soon afterwards, Roo – believed to be a cross between a collie and a whippet – was fostered by nurse Nikki Dick, 50, and her fireman husband Ian, 52, and they now plan to adopt her permanently.

Mrs Dick, from Morpeth, Northumberland, said: ‘We’ve fallen in love with her, how could you not? She is such a little star. 

'Roo doesn’t know any different to hopping on her two back legs but she still laps up all the fuss from people who always stop and do a double take when they see her because they think she is a kangaroo.

‘She’s perfectly happy and pain-free and vets are very happy with her progress.’

The couple, who have six other rescue dogs, treat Roo to weekly hydrotherapy and physiotherapy sessions to ease any strain on her back.
