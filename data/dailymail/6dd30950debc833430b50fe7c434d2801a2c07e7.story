To celebrate their 60th birthday, UEFA asked fans to vote for the top 10 goals scored in the history of UEFA competitions from a list of 60.

After over 200 million individual ratings, the results are in with the likes of Marco van Basten, Zinedine Zidane and Radamel Falcao all making the cut.

Stoke striker Peter Crouch can also cap off a brilliant week which included scoring Arsenal and crowd surfing at a Kasabian gig, by claiming a place in the final 10 for his superb overhead kick while playing for Liverpool against Galatasaray in 2006.

Here, Sportsmail have compiled the top 10 goals scored in UEFA competitions over the past 60 years.

MARCO VAN BASTEN - USSR 0-2 Netherlands - Euro 1998

It may be the oldest goal to make the top 10, but Van Basten's sensational right-footed volley would still take some beating today. The Dutch maestro received what looked to be an overhit cross from Arnold Muhren before letting to ball drop on the far side of the USSR penalty area and unleashing an unstoppable angled volley with his right foot to give his side a 2-0 lead to seal their European Championship victory.

 

MAURO BRESSAN - Fiorentina 3-3 Barcelona - 1999-00 Champions League

Any goal against Barcelona would be something to write home about, but Bressan's 30-yard overhead kick during a thrilling 3-3 group stage clash was truly something worth shouting about. The diminutive Italian capitalised on some poor Barca defending by pouncing underneath a bouncing ball to loop the ball up and into the Barca net.

 

ZINEDINE ZIDANE - Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Real Madrid - 2002 Champions League final 

Not only did Zidane's wondrous volley send shockwaves around Europe while writing his name into competition folklore, the strike helped Madrid to their ninth Champions League title. Zidane looked on as a Roberto Carlos cross took an age to come down before smashing home one of the greatest goals ever scored on the European stage.

RUI COSTA - Portugal 2-2 England - Euro 2004

Costa broke English hearts back in 2004 with this unstoppable strike against the Three Lions in Lisbon. Costa ran from the halfway line, virtually unopposed to begin with, before jinking his way to the edge of England's box. David James didn't stand a chance as Costa fired a right-footed strike into the top corner.    

PETER CROUCH - Liverpool 3-2 Galatasaray - 2006-07 Champions League

England's only top 10 entry into UEFA's greatest goal hall of fame. In a week that has seen Crouch being spotted crowd-surfing during a music concert, the 6ft 7in striker can now look back on his Liverpool overhead kick as one of the best goals ever scored in a UEFA competition. Reds right back Steve Finnan whipped in a cross which looked to be sailing behind the big frontman, but in one majestic movement, crouch pulled his right fight back and plucked the cross out of the Anfield sky.

CRISTIANO RONALDO - Porto 0-1 Manchester United - 2008-09 Champions League quarter-final

It wouldn't be a top 10 list without some input from former United forward Ronaldo. The Portuguese star has been a career of scoring stunning goals at a spectacular rate and this Champions League quarter-final piledriver deserves its place in the final selection. 

Ronaldo controlled a pass from Anderson, turned, and hit a 40-yard striker straight into the Porto net. Even Ronaldo, not known for his modesty, claimed the goal was the best of his career.

DEJAN STANKOVIC - Inter Milan 2-5 Schalke - 2010-11 Champions League quarter-final

Stankovic pounced on a rare mistake from then Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to volley home from just inside the away side's half. The German stopper flew out of his penalty area and sent a diving header towards a first-time strike to be proud of - even if Stankovic's side  crashed out.

RADAMEL FALCAO - Atletico Madrid 3-0 Athletic - 2011-12 Europa League final 

How Manchester United fans will wish Falcao can return to form with a goal similar to his curling effort. Top scorer in that season's Europa League, Falcao topped of his efforts by collecting a pass from midfielder Diego, evading Fernando Amorebieta and bending a left-footed finish into the back of the net.    

 

SAMUEL UMTITI - Tottenham 2-1 Lyon - 2012-13 Europa League 

The only defender to feature in the top 10 list, but Umtiti deserves his place. The full back whizzed onto a poor clearance from Spurs defender William Gallas to hammer his side level at White Hart Lane. Gareth Bale may have bagged the winner, but Umtiti's strike was surely the talk of north London.  

 

ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC - Anderlecht 0-5 PSG - 2013-14 Champions League group stage

The big Swede showed everybody inside the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium just how to Zlatan with one of his most memorable goals to date. With a sight at goal, the forward didn't even need to take a touch before rifling in a perfect half-volley.      

Aaron Ramsey scored a stunning 30-yard half-volley for Arsenal in their 4-1 win over Galatasaray on Tuesday night. 

The strike was so good it had former Gunners legend Paul Merson purring: 'I've never seen anything like it in all my years. It was phenomenal.'

So do UEFA now need to revise their list of all-time top goals?
