Tamara Beckwith became famous for her partying lifestyle and she had cause to celebrate today as her father tied the knot with new love Vivien McLean.

Former 'It' girl, Tamara, 43, is now married to Giorgio Veroni, with whom she has a daughter, Violet. The family put on their best dress to today come together to celebrate her father's happiness.

Property magnate, Peter, wore his bridal tails with a bright yellow tie while his bride wore a pale blue dress for the service at The Queen's Chapel of the Savoy in London this afternoon.

Happy day: Clare said she and Tamara are glad their father has found love again after losing their mother to cancer in 2011

Tamara was on hand to throw confetti over the happy couple, with the help of Violet, five, dressed as a pretty flower girl.

The mother-of-two wore a lacy peach dress and with a nude coloured hat and matching heels.

She was also joined by her eldest daughter, Anouska, 26, who wore a bright yellow dress and floral headband, and her partner.

The bride and groom met in 2012 following the death of Tamara's mother, Paula, who tragically died in 2011 of endometrial cancer at the age of 68.

Now man and wife: The couple met in 2012

Big day: The pair were all smiles as they were driven from the venue

In an interview with the Mail On Sunday's You magazine earlier this year, Tamara's sister, Clare, 41, said they both wholeheartedly approved of the union and how Vivien had helped Peter deal with his grief.

Clare, who wore a short silver mini dress and matching hat to today's wedding, recalled in her interview with Jane Gordon that losing their mother has been a terrible ordeal but they are glad their father has found love again.

The married mother-of-two said: 'Sunday lunch was sacrosanct for Mummy. 
We would sit together with Mummy at one end of the table and Daddy at 
the other. It's hard to see someone left behind because you want your 
parents to be together all their lives.

'But yesterday, when we were 
having Sunday lunch at Daddy's with Vivien sitting in my mother's place 
it felt right somehow, and I thought, "Mummy would have wanted this", 
because all she ever wanted was for us to be happy.'
