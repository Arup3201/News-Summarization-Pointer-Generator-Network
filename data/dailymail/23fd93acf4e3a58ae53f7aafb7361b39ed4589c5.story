A new picture of V. Stiviano and ex-lover Donald Sterling was released today, giving another taste of the May-December couple's strange dynamic.

In the image exclusively obtained by InTouch, Stiviano jokingly holds a knife up to Sterling's throat while dining out at a Los Angeles steak house a year ago - a symbolic omen of the backstabbing to come.Â 

'It was typical V., being crazy,' Rachel Rodriguez, a former friend of the couple, told the magazine.

Stiviano went on to get Sterling banned from the NBA, when she recorded Sterling's racial slurs during private conversations.

This 
latest photo was released just a day after Sterling told a reporter he's
 'feeling fabulous' after losing ownership of the Los Angeles Clippers.

The
 80-year-old real estate mogul attended a charity event for the homeless
 in Los Angeles Tuesday night were he was cornered by a reporter for NBC 4 who asked him how he's dealing with the loss.

'I
 feel fabulous, I feel very good,' Sterling said. 'Everything is just 
the way it should be really. It may have worked out differently, but 
it's good. It's all good.'

'I'm OK, I'm OK,' Sterling added. 'Is the NBA OK? I'm not sure about that. Is (NBA Commissioner) Adam Silver OK? I'm sure he's OK.'

Sterling said he's ready to 'move on' from the scandal.

The NBA's Board of Governors was 
prepared to force Sterling to sell his team after tapes were leaked in 
which he told his girlfriend V.Stiviano not to bring black people to his
 games.

But that vote was called off by the NBA on Friday, after he transferred ownership to estranged wife Shelly Sterling.

Last week, Shelly sold the team to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for a record $2billion.

Shelly Sterling also dined out Tuesday night, and was photographed outside celebrity hotspot Craig's Steakhouse in West Hollywood.

She is currently in the process of finalizing the sale to Ballmer. The Board of Governors will need to vote to approve the sale to finalize it.

The vote was called off the same day Sterling's attorneys filed a lawsuit against the NBA and Silver, asking for damages over $1billion.

It's still uncertain whether he plans to continue with the suit.

Meanwhile, V. Stiviano is facing problems of her own. In New York on Sunday, Stiviano claims she was beat up in a racial-motivated attack outside the Gansevoort Hotel.

She says she was attacked by two men and called a 'n***** b****'.

She shared pictured of her battered face, but when she later stepped out that day she was blemish free.
