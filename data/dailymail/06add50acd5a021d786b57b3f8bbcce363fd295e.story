A Serbian journalist has come under fire after providing a visual demonstration while reporting on how farmers in a remote mountain village keep their privates warm.

Jovan Memedovic, 54, had been dispatched to a small shepherding community in Bosnia and Herzegovina's Vlasic mountains, where temperatures are known to drop in wintertime.

In order to shield their genitals from the cold, the male villagers knit their own woolly penis warmers.

Unusual tradition: Serbian broadcaster Jovan Memedovic  was visiting a mountain village in Bosnia and Herzegovina where the local men knit their own 'woolly manhood warmers' in wintertime

Visual presentation: Mr Memedovic decided to show viewers exactly what it would look like when the local farmers put on their hand-made woolly manhood warmers

Attempting to provide his viewers with an authentic account of village life, Mr Memedovic decided to try the 'woolly warmer' on camera.

As the report was broadcast in a prime time slot, thousands of viewers' jaws dropped when Mr Memedovic suddenly unzipped his trousers to model the manhood cover.  

After watching the whole 'woolly warmer' process, from the shearing of the sheep's wool, to knitting the slipper-sized sheaths, Mr Memedovic unzipped his flies and told startled viewers: 'So, it looks something like this'

Fortunately TV bosses managed to pixelate Mr Memedovic's member, but that did not stop viewers from flooding the station with calls and responses on social media.

After watching the whole 'woolly warmer' process, from the shearing of the sheep's wool, to knitting the slipper-sized sheaths, Mr Memedovic wanted to give viewers 'the full experience'

Mr Memedovic said the warmer 'was a bit itchy at the start, but actually very comfortable and above all warm' 

Not that type of sock: A few of the hand-knitted penis warmers made by the Bosnian farmers 

Mother-of-two Suncica Martinovic, 34, posted: 'I enjoy his documentaries as they show me bits and pieces of life I wasn't aware of or would never normally see.

'But I wasn't expecting to see him do that, just as well it was pixelated.'

Stana Pavic, 24, from the Serbian capital Belgrade posted she was impressed by the man-sized covers saying: 'Wow! I've never been to that mountain but if that's the size of the average male then perhaps it's worth checking out.' 

A spokesman for the TV station said: 'Some viewers call to say the subject was inappropriate, others want to know where they can buy the items in the shops.'

When asked about the incident Memedovic explained: 'If I wanted to explain it properly, I needed to try it on.'

'It was a bit itchy at the start, but actually very comfortable and above all warm.'
