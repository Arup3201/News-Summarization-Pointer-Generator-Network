David Cameron was facing embarrassment last night after it emerged police were called when his local bishop tried to deliver an open letter about food poverty.

The Bishop of Oxford, the Right Reverend John Pritchard, was barred from entering the Prime Minister's constituency office in Witney, Oxfordshire, earlier this month.

Police were called to deal with the bishop and a group of 40 campaigners who were trying to deliver a letter urging Mr Cameron to do more to tackle poverty.

Tory sources last night insisted that Mr Cameron's staff were not responsible for calling the police.

A spokesman for Mr Cameron: 'The Bishop of Oxford's petition about world hunger will be passed on to the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street.' But the incident is embarrassing for the Prime Minister, coming just days after he spoke about the importance of his Christian faith to his politics.

The Reverend Keith Hebden, a prominent food poverty campaigner who was also present, said the police had left quickly, but said the group had been forced to abandon its bid to deliver the letter.

He said: 'It is deeply ironic, to say the least, that on the same day David Cameron was writing in the Church Times talking about what a good Anglican he is, he wasn't able to receive his own bishop in his constituency office. I think this speaks volumes.

'They were expecting us - we had phoned ahead. Most of my surprise was reserved for them not even opening the door. The letter was positive and addressed to all three party leaders, so it wasn't political.'

Tory sources last night denied they had been given advance notice of the visit and suggested the letter should have been delivered to Downing Street.
