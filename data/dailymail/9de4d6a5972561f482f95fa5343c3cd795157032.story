A mother left in a vegetative state by a meth-addled driver who smashed into her car when she was pregnant has been awarded a record $9.3 million in a settlement.

The family of Cayla Wilson, 23, and her three-year-old daughter JaiKyla sued the city of Portland, Oregon and Clackamas County, claiming that the driver's probation officer and a police officer who saw him before the crash should have taken actions that could have prevented the crash.

On Wednesday, the state's insurance carrier was ordered to pay $4.5 million, Clackamas County's will pay $3.3 million and Clackamas County itself will be pay out $1 million.

Devastating: Cayla Wilson, now 23, suffered brain injuries when a driver under the influence of meth crashed into her in 2010. Cayla, pictured a month after the crash, has won a $9million payout

Family: She was five months pregnant at the time of the crash and her daughter, pictured, was delivered five weeks later by C-section. The little girl has cerebral palsy, which is linked to her premature birth

Attorneys involved in the settlement told The Oregonian that it is the largest payout by any government entity in the state's history.

The money will go towards the care of Wilson, who was five months pregnant when Jack Whiteaker, high on meth, veered into an oncoming lane and smashed into her Buick on April 15, 2010.

She suffered fractures to her skull and jaw and extensive brain damage that has left her bedridden, unable to talk or unable to care for herself. Her parents Bill and Denise now care for her around-the-clock at their home in Gresham, rotating her in her bed every two hours, bathing and feeding her.

Her daughter, JaiKyla, was born by 
Cesarian section five weeks after the crash and has cerebral palsy, 
which is linked to her premature birth.

Denise
 Wilson said she sat beside her daughter on Wednesday evening after the 
settlement and told her they would not have
 to worry about money.

'She had tears,' Denise Wilson told The 
Oregonian. 'I told her that she and her daughter are going to have a 
very bright future.'

Before the crash: Wilson, pictured before the accident, is now entirely reliant on her parents. They believe that the driver's parole officer and a police officer could have taken steps to prevent the tragedy

Life-changing: Wilson's father Bill holds after her daughter, JaiKyla, now three, outside court in 2012. Bill and his wife now care for their daughter and granddaughter around the clock

Attorneys on behalf of the family had filed a $42 million suit, naming Dawn Penberthy, a Clackamas County Community Corrections probation officer, and Portland police officer Devonna Dick.

Locked up: Jack Whiteaker was found guilty and is serving 11 years in prison for the crash

They contended that Penberthy had not 
supervised Wilson strictly enough. He gave false address and work 
information, and failed to attend meetings with the probation office and
 drug treatments.

When she filled out papers to haul him back in front of authorities, they had no idea where he was.

The suit said that Dick twice came across Whiteaker on the day before he crashed into Wilson, but failed to take him into custody.

In the first instance, she responded to a 911 call after a store owner reported that he was harassing customers and acting strangely. She noticed that his license was suspended but because he was not in his vehicle at the time, she did not think she had probable cause to arrest him.

She later responded to another report that he had been running through yards and looking in a window, and when Dick found him hiding in a bush, he seemed 'out of it'. But she let him go.

Wilson's attorneys said that Dick should have arrested him for driving with a suspended license or for trespassing. But authorities have denied that the staff are to blame in the incident.

Police chief Mike Reese said that it would have been inappropriate for the officer to arrest Whiteaker because she lacked probable cause.

Crash scene: Whiteaker veered across the road and smashed into Wilson's Buick, leaving her brain damaged and unable to car for herself. Whiteaker was high on meth and had skipped probation

A spokesman for Mayor Charlie Hales 
said Portland police have also been affected by findings by the U.S. 
Department of Justice that they have used excessive force against people
 who suffer from or are perceived to suffer from mental illness.

And Clackamas County counsel Stephen 
Madkour added: 'It's important to point out that the wrongdoer, the 
person who caused all this tragedy, was Jack Whiteaker.'

Whiteaker,
 who wasn't named in the lawsuit, is serving an 11-year prison sentence 
after being found guilty of DUI, second-degree assault and reckless 
driving in the crash.

Prosecutors argued for the maximum sentence in 2012 and played a jail phone recording of Whiteaker saying he hoped Wilson remained in a coma for the rest of her life.

Because of Wilson, he said, he would miss out on cigarettes and women while locked up.

During his sentencing, Wilson's parents gave moving victim impact statements.

Caretakers: The Wilsons, seen in 2012, said Cayla shed a tear when they told her about the payout

'We have lost everything,' Denise Wilson said. 'You have left a family torn 
and destroyed. We are trying to figure out how to move forward, but it's
 like we're stuck on the day you took her from us.'

But throughout the statements, Whiteaker interrupted the family, The Oregonian reported.

'I didn't do it!' yelled Whiteaker.

'Cayla is 21 years old and has been in a hospital bed for two years,' Bill Wilson said.

'I've been in jail for two years!' Whiteaker shouted.
