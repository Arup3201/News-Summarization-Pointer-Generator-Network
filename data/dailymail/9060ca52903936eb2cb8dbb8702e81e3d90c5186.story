Boxed macaroni and cheese is off the menu at the White House. Michelle Obama said she banned it from her family's diet after being alerted to its processed ingredients.

In an interview for the March issue of Cooking Light magazine, the mother-of-two recalled how her daughters used to love the cheap and easy-to-make meal.

However, Sam Kass, the family's former personal chef, vehemently opposed the boxed variety and decided to give a quick tutorial to highlight the 'unhealthiness' of the product.

Slap up supper: Michelle Obama said she banned boxed macaroni and cheese from her family's diet after being alerted to its processed ingredients

Mrs Obama said that Kass gave her daughter Malia, who was about eight years old at the time, a block of cheese and challenged her to turn it into the same powdery consistency as the ingredient in the mac and cheese box.

The youngster apparently spent 30 minutes trying to 'pulverize' the block of cheese into dust with no joy. 

Mrs Obama said from that point she and her family stopped eating macaroni and cheese out of a box 'because cheese dust is not food, as was the moral of the story.'

The Obama's diet is now apparently completely rid of processed foods.

However, in the past when Mrs Obama was working, shopping and cooking, she admitted it was tough being so health conscious. 

'Sometimes I would use processed food a little bit more. I relied on takeout probably more than I should’ve,' the 51-year-old recalled.

But now, as she marks the fifth anniversary of her anti-childhood-obesity initiative Let's Move!, the first lady wants to arm families with the knowledge she didn't have in the past.

'It’s doable - people just need the training and the education. 

'What we do know is that the food you cook is healthier, and it can be more affordable, but it takes some skills,' she said.

A couple of the first lady's tips include, banishing canned juices, learning how to cut up a whole chicken and making pasta dishes from scratch.

Not for me: Mrs Obama says through a better diet she hopes to still be mobile as an 80 or 90-year-old woman

'It’s some tomatoes, it’s some basil, it’s boiling pasta, it’s adding in a little flavoring and seasoning, and you have a delicious meal. It’s quick. It’s fast. It becomes faster the more you do it,' she chimed.

Growing up in a working class family, Mrs Obama said her mother was very nifty with food.

She would shop on a budget and create a menu plan. Leftovers from Sunday roast beef dinners would be used for lunches on Mondays and Tuesdays. 

Other favorite home-cooked dishes growing up included lemon chicken and lasagna but she was less keen on 'liver Wednesdays.'

Mrs Obama says through a better diet she hopes to be an active, globetrotting  80 or 90-year-old woman.

'I want to be able to walk up a temple or a ruin on my own and see the world. And I can only do that if I've been investing in my health now.'

The Chicago native also sites physical activity as a key ingredient to success, something which she has introduced through her Let’s Move Active Schools program.

Touching further on her eating habits at home, Mrs Obama says that she and Barack have dinner almost every night together around 6:30pm.

She concluded: 'We have a bigger table and somebody else is doing the cooking, but the conversation and the mood and the tone are still the same. It’s our most important time of the day.' 

The March issue  of Cooking Light magazine featuring Mrs Obama on the cover is due on newsstands Friday.
