A record number of cash-strapped older women have been forced back into work by the rising cost of living, a study has found.

A report by the TUC will reveal 2,278,000  more women are in work now compared to 20 years ago.

Of those, 72 per cent - or 1,645,000 - are aged 50 or over.

Official data from the Office of National Statistics released last week showed female employment in the UK has reached its highest level since records began, as the overall number of unemployed people fell again at the end of last year,.

The employment rate among women reached 67.2 per cent, the highest level since 1971.

The latest rise was driven by an increase in the number of women working full time, which was up by 122,000, to 8.1 million, over the past three months.

Female workers now account for 46 per cent of the total UK workforce.

The number with part-time jobs fell, by 28,000, to 5.9 million, while in comparison the number of men in both full-time and part-time work rose.

But the TUC study will reveal this week how many older women have felt the need to return to work or to continue working until later in life.

It points to a combination of reasons.

These include the rising cost of living, the increase in the state pension age and the fall in value of workplace pensions.

The Observer reported today that in 1992, 50.7 per cent of women in the 50 to 64 age group were economically 'inactive', compared with 36.8 per cent today.

The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: 'Many work because they want to and can take advantage of the new opportunities and attitudes that have opened up during their lifetimes.

'Others are working because they cannot afford not to. The living standards crisis, the increase in the state pension age and the decline in workplace pensions all put pressure on older women. Many will be the sole earner in a household.'
