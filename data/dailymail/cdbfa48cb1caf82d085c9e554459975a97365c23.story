Retired party girls Millie Mackintosh, Suki Waterhouse and Daisy Lowe have swapped cocktails at the Groucho Club and late nights at the Box for early morning work-out sessions, which involve whipping and bear crawling.

The IT girls have been hanging out at SBC, which stands for the Skinny B**** Collective, and it's fast become the go-to gym for fashion's most famous fitness fanatics.

Run by trainer Russell Bateman, SBC is an elite and intense 50-minute circuits style class run in Baker Street's Fitness First and exclusive Chelsea gym KX.

Elite new fitness crowd: The Skinny B**** Collective is drawing in fashion's finest faces and whips them into shape in an intense 50-minute work-out session

Russell offers group sessions or one-to-one personal training that aims to help class-goers get lean, strong and fit aesthetics.

He designs exercises that speed up metabolism, build fitness and strength and decrease body fat.

'My buddy once said I only trained skinny bitches, hence the name Skinny Bitch Collective was born,' Bateman told MailOnline.

'It was a jokey comment but It stuck in my head. I came up with a catchy name and the rest is history.

Famous fan: Bateman likes to challenge the body in ways you wouldn't conventionally see. Millie Mackintosh (pictured) doing upside down burpees against a wall is one of those ways

Just whip it: Model Suki Waterhouse uploaded a video of her in the class to her Instagram account

'There's nothing skinny about SBC. We are plump with female empowerment and re-education in a world saturated with misconceptions about fitness and health.'

Suki Waterhouse is said to love the class, which has attendees crawling on their hands and knees and doing one legged burpees, because it helps her 'release her inner animal'.

Bateman, who has been a trainer for eight years and established the SBC project last year, said of his class: 'I fuse traditional movements with more extreme movements and exercises that' you wouldn't have done since a kid.

'I have girls crawling into each other and carrying each other on their backs. This can challenge the body in ways you wouldn't conventionally see. Millie doing upside down burpees against a wall for example is a strange sight obviously!'.

Thanks to his celebrity clientele who can't stop raving about him, Bateman is in very high demand and selective about who he will train.

He has a huge waiting list and his Saturday classes are invite-only.

'You have to be a nice person with a good heart and work your socks off - no time for negativity,' he says of the selection process

Model friends: Bateman has joined forces with Danielle Copperman, the nutritionist behind website Model Mange Tout (pictured, left, with model Daisy Lowe)

He has recently launched online training classes and diet programmes formulated by Danielle Copperman, the nutritionist behind website Model Mange Tout, who happens to be BFF's with Charlotte Wiggins and Sam Rollinson.

SBC's model clients were asked by Stella McCartney to design and consult on her London Fashion Week show, whereby models showcased her designs while running on a treadmill.

SBC, where price is on application, has already hosted pop-ups in New York and Ibiza and has big plans for the future.

'Without sounding too up myself, SBC is training the next generation of female icons,' Bateman told Fashionista. 'You’re going to see a lot of our girls fronting campaigns this year and on the screen.'

Have more sex, sleep well and move daily. Commit to eliminating 
anything that isn't improving the quality of your life. If it isn't 
making you stronger it's making you weaker. Eat loads of cruciferous vegetables too as this will help to detox and shift stubborn fat from legs and tummy areas. 

Skinny Bitch Collective founder and personal trainer Russell Bateman is the go-to guy to hone the coltish physiques: London's stylish model set.

I've trained with him a handful of times over the last few months and the man is a fitness genius. To say he works you hard is an understatement but the results speak for themselves.

There's no danger of reaching an exercise plateau either as he's continually inventing new methods of torture to mix things up and a single session can have you running against the wall while performing a semi-handstand, executing single leg burpies and primal crawling wearing an exercise band.

He's big on the holistic approach too - both in terms of the fuel you put into your body and also in the way he encourages collaboration within the collective - from model Danielle Copperman and her inspired ModelMangeTout recipe blog to hip exercise gear designer Charli Cohen and jewellery-designer-meets-health-writer, Cat Meffan.

ou don't have to be uber skinny to join the gang (thought you do need to be invited and possess the right attitude) but if you stick with the SBC programme you soon will be!
