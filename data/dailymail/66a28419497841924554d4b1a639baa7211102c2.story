Fears: Cath Kidston, pictured at a showroom in London, has said she fears she has a shelf life and that her company will get rid of her

Cath Kidston fears she has a shelf life and her multi-million pound company will eventually say 'we've had enough of you'.

Kidston, whose kitsch patterned goods have made her an estimated £25 million, said having the founder involved 'can be a real problem' for any business.

The millionairess - who opened her first store in Holland Park, London, 20 years ago - said she knew she had a 'shelf life', adding: 'I should 
probably leave so it is healthy, but at the moment I am loving it.'

Kidston, who is now creative director having relinquished her majority 
stake three years ago, said she often struggles to take a step back from the business and she has a tendency to stick her oar in 'which probably drives people crazy.'

The businesswoman was speaking at The Times Cheltenham Literature Festival to mark the release of her book Coming Up Roses - which celebrates company's 20-year anniversary.

During the talk, she said the brand's success was down to its 'modern vintage' style and the company's ability to 'tilt towards the trend'.

Kidston also spoke about a difficult period the company went through in 2003 when she was forced to sell her first stake, shortly after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

A the time the company had tried, unsuccessfully, to open stores in the US before it was ready.

'It was too much too fast,' she said.

Kidston also said she had recently been renovating
a house in Gloucestershire, revealing one domestic item that would never feature a Cath Kidston design. 'Putting a print on an Aga is a step
too far,' she said.

Kidston first registered the business in 1993 opening the first Holland Park store - which she has called a 'glorified junk shop' in the past - soon after, with a budget of just £15,000.

In the past, she has said the store and its distinct sytle was inspired by her own childhood in rural Hampshire.

At first, the store mainly sold furniture and fabric,- including her flagship 'Rose Bouquet' print.

She closed her interior design 
business in the mid-1990s to focus her energies on the Cath Kidston 
brand - which now includes everything from wallpaper to dog collars, and gazebos to smartphone cases.

By 1999, the business had expanded - with Kidston opening stores in Marylebone, Fulham and Wimbledon.

Three years ago, Kidston, the cousin of property guru Kirstie Allsopp, sold her majority stake -  which has been controlled since 2010 by American private equity group TA Associates, who own a 60 per cent.

Business is blooming: Demand from Asian 
consumers has helped to propel sales of Cath Kidston's distinctive brand
of floral homeware past the £100million mark for the first time

Overall the firm's results for the year 2012 to March 31 2013 indicate annual sales were up to £105million, with British sales up 21 per cent also.

Overseas sales rocketed by 53 per cent - mainly driven by an increase in demand in Asia.

The company is now looking to expand further into the far East, having already opened stores in Japan and China.

The business will add a second Shanghai store to its 30 other outlets in China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan later this year.

There are 32 Cath Kidston stores in Japan, meaning the brand now has more overseas outlets than British stores.

Modern vintage: Cath Kidston's floral tents began cropping up at the Glastonbury festival as her popularity grew

As a young designer, her idyllic 
childhood in the English countryside provided Cath Kidston with the 
inspiration she need to create what is now a global brand.

It
was nostalgia for the colours, prints and fabrics of her childhood home
that informed Kidston's concept of 'modern vintage' - the style she hit
upon after spotting a picture in a magazine of rose wallpaper on the 
side of a bath.

She 
opened her first tiny store close to Holland Park in 1993, with a 
start-up budget of £15,000 - almost a third of which she ploughed into 
creating her first print, Rose Bouquet.

Kidston used vintage fabrics to 
produce cheerful floral ironing board covers and cushion covers which 
she sold alongside second hand furniture.

As her store grew in popularity, press attention followed, and so too did hordes of customers.

By
the late 1990s the Cath Kidston brand was expanding with more London 
stores and new prints and products, and she attracted a celebrity fan 
base. Glastonbury was first accused of having become middle-class when 
festival-goers were spotted sporting playful Cath Kidston wellies to 
tramp through the mud between stages.

After
Kidston sold the majority share in the business to fund further 
expansion, stores popped up in Bath, Brighton, Bristol, Edinburgh and 
York among others, eventually leading to a stable of 35 UK stores.

In 2006 the first Cath Kidston store opened in Tokyo, Japan, with customers queuing around the block to get in.

In
2010 TA Associates bought a majority stake and, with the help of new 
Asian partners, the retailer opened further stores in Taiwan, Korea, 
Hong Kong and Thailand.

Today
there are 59 stores and concessions in the UK and Ireland, and 54 
across Spain, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China.
