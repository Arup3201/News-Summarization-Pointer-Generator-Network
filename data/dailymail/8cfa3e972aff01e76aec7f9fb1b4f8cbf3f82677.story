Brendan Rodgers has vowed to keep making bold decisions even though he accepts too many wrong calls would mean he pays a heavy price.

Liverpool’s manager maintains there was nothing defeatist about the controversial team he selected against Real Madrid, insisting there was enough quality - even without Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson - to get a result in the Bernabeu.

Rodgers’ decisions have been heavily scrutinised in the last 48 hours but, crucially, not by Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owners. Chairman Tom Werner is over for Saturday’s game against Chelsea and he met Rodgers on Thursday to discuss how the season has been panning out.

‘The owners have been brilliant,’ said Rodgers. ‘The only people who matter to me are the people here at the club, the players and supporters. You become a manager and know the criticism will come. Whether it is deserved or not you take it.

‘Tom spoke to me and straight away they see the courage in playing a different team and younger players and how I have dealt with my situation here. They have always been supportive, great for me.’

There is no suggestion Rodgers is under pressure and the 4,500 Liverpool fans who travelled to Madrid gave him constant and noisy backing; the only burden he feels comes from within, as he continues to look for solutions that will get Liverpool winning consistently.

He understands, though, why there was such a reaction to events in Madrid. Had it backfired and Liverpool ended up losing heavily, the criticism would have been even more intense. That, says Rodgers, is the way of the world for a Liverpool manager.

‘The only thing I showed the other night was the trust I have in the team,’ insisted Rodgers. ‘I never feared that if I play this team we are going to end up losing 7, 8-0 and what would be the consequence of that.

‘I have never gone into a game in my life and felt that we are not going to get a result. But the thinking and the strategy that goes behind it is deep in terms of analysing the opponent.

'You have to be bold enough to make the decisions as a manager.

‘That is why you are paid the money you are paid. If you make more wrong ones than right ones you will be out of work. It’s a big risk but for me I’m happy with the decisions I make. 

'My players were magnificent. I know there is a little bit of criticism about the selection, but it does a disservice to the players who played.’
