Fears: Attorney General Dominic Grieve said that the rise of religious fundamentalism has made Christian reluctant to express belief

Moderate Christians are afraid to declare their religion publicly because of the rise of fundamentalism, a minister said last night.

Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General, said the rise of religious fundamentalists had made Christians reluctant to express their beliefs.

He said they were being ‘turned off’ by the ‘disturbing’ and ‘very damaging’ rise of those with a ‘deep intolerance’ to other people’s views.

Mr Grieve said atheists who said Britain was no longer a Christian nation were ‘deluding themselves’ and must accept that faith had shaped this country’s laws and ethics.

He said that 1,500 years of Christian values were ‘not going to disappear overnight’ and that many people remained believers even if they chose not to go to church.

But he said that people were being discouraged from openly declaring their beliefs because of the ‘deep intolerance’ of religious extremists of all faiths, including Islam and Christianity.

‘I do think that there has been a rise of an assertiveness of religious groups across the spectrum,’ he said last night.

‘That is why those with softer religious views find it disturbing and say they don’t want anything to do with it.’

Mr Grieve’s comments follow criticism of David Cameron for declaring Britain to be a ‘Christian country’.

A group of 55  liberal celebrities, scientists and academics accused the Prime Minister of sowing ‘alienation and division’ and fuelling ‘sectarian divides’.

Mr Grieve told the Telegraph that ‘atheism hasn’t made much progress’ in Britain and that ‘our state, its ethics and our society are underpinned by Christian values’.

He added: ‘Many of the underlying ethics of society are Christian-based and the result of 1,500 years of Christian input into our national life. It is not going to disappear overnight.

‘They [the atheists] are deluding themselves. I do think that the rise of religious fundamentalism is a major deterrent to people. It is a big turn-off away from religion generally, and it’s very damaging. It encourages people to say “I’m not interested” [and] an unwillingness to express commitment.

‘The evidence in this country is overwhelming that most people by a very substantial margin have religious belief in the supernatural or a deity.’

Mr Grieve’s comments are at variance with census statistics which show that in 2011, the percentage reporting ‘no religion’ had almost doubled to more than 25 per cent.
