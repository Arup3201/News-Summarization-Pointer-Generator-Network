A heavily pregnant woman was forced to undergo a humiliating medical examination on a packed plane to prove that she was fit to fly.

Kerry Deane was horrified when staff on the Thomson Holidays flight ordered her to the front of the plane in front of passengers to be checked by two doctors in an area where food is prepared.

Miss Deane, who was 35 weeks pregnant, and showing no signs of going into labour, was eventually escorted off the flight with her partner and three young children.

This was despite the 32-year-old carrying documentation from her GP stating that she was fit to travel. 

Kerry Deane, pictured with her son Hudson, was forced to undergo a humiliating internal exam at the front of the plane after flight staff apparently decided she was too close to her due date to fly

Then, instead of the usual four-hour flight from Tunisia to Glasgow, the family had to endure a 19-hour marathon before finally stepping through their front door.

Miss Deane said: ‘The way were treated was an absolute disgrace, and we haven’t even had an apology from Thomson.

‘To say it was an ordeal is an understatement. I was upset and sobbing, but they didn’t take any notice, and just kept saying: “It’ll be OK”.’

Miss Deane, who was pregnant with son Hudson, now three months old, was due to fly out of Tunisia after a week away when she was approached on board and told that she had to be examined by medical staff based at Enfidha airport.

The women doctors took her blood pressure and checked her bump, before carrying out an intrusive examination in the plane’s front galley.  

Miss Deane said: ‘They didn’t carry out the examination in any sort of sterile way.

‘And I can’t believe we were thrown off the plane as it was obvious I was not in labour.’

She said she was left fearing she would have to stay in Tunisia to give birth. ‘How do you get home from Tunisia if you cannot fly?’ Miss Deane said.

‘I was thinking, I’m stuck here for at least seven weeks. What about my children? I only had a week’s clothes.’

Ms Deane said the experience left her humiliated - but Thomson, which was not operating the flight that day, have refused to take any responsibility

After being taken off the plane last September, Miss Deane, her partner and children Broxon, ten, Alicia, nine, and Garyn, six, then endured a 19-hour ordeal to get home.

First they had a lengthy wait for a flight to Newcastle – rather than their preferred destination of Glasgow. As a result they then had to sit on a minibus to get to their home in Kilsyth, North Lanarkshire.

NHS advice states that it is normally safe to fly while you are pregnant - but it is the airlines which decide whether or not to let you fly towards the end. 

British Airways says it restricts travel beyond the end of the 36th week, while people carrying twins or triplet cannot fly beyond the end of the 32nd week. 

However, the airline does say it would like women to carry a doctors note after the 28th week, confirming due date and the fact it isn't complicated.

Easyjet allows mothers to fly until the 35th week, and women carrying twins until the 32nd.

RyanAir has the same cut off dates as BA, and asks mothers to carry the letter from 28 weeks - but says it reserves the right to refuse travel from this point if they don't have one.

Emirates asks for letter after the 29th week, but has the same cut off dates as BA. 

Miss Deane said that the family was not offered any vouchers for food or water while they waited for the later flight, and said she ran up a £100 phone bill calling relatives in distress.

She added: ‘You go with these big companies because you think they have procedures, but it means nothing.

‘It’s crazy. The whole situation shows how you have no rights. We cannot protect ourselves.’ 

Before flying, Miss Deane had sought the advice of her GP on four occasions, and said she checked with Thomson as instructed by their staff because she was concerned about the timing of the holiday, which she had booked before she was aware she was pregnant.

She said she even requested her GP to fax to Thomson’s headquarters documentation permitting her to fly.

However, Thomson, whose rules state a woman can fly up to 36 weeks pregnant, has distanced itself from the incident, claiming that the flight was operated by a third party.

A spokesman said: ‘We are sorry to hear of Miss Deane’s experience on the return from her holiday in Tunisia.

‘On this occasion the flight was not operated by us but by a third party airline. As every airline has its own policy regarding flying during pregnancy we advised Miss Deane to speak directly to this airline prior to travel to avoid any potential issues.

‘As we understand Miss Deane has instructed a solicitor, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.'
