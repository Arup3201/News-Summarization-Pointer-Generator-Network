A woman visiting her mother in Oregon is suing her neighbor and seeking $275,000 for pain, suffering and other damages that she says were inflicted when a pet duck ambushed her for no apparent reason.

Cynthia Ruddell, 62, of Washougal, Washington, was on her mother's property in Estacada, Oregon, about 25 miles southeast of Portland, when a neighbor's duck attacked her without warning.

According to the suit filed in Oregon state court last Friday, in her attempt to run away from the agitated swan, Ruddell fell to the ground, breaking her right wrist and spraining an elbow and shoulder.

Quack attack: An Oregon woman is getting sued for a whopping $275,000 after her pet duck allegedly attacked a woman on the street, breaking the woman¿s wrist and spraining her elbow

The incident occurred in May 2012. The complaint accuses the bird's owner, Lolita Rose, of failing to maintain control of her pet or 'to warn or otherwise inform neighbors of her duck's dangerous propensity in attacking individuals.'

Ruddell, a retired nurse, is seeking up to $275,000 in damages, including roughly $25,000 for medical expenses, with the remainder being for pain, suffering and the toll her injuries have taken on her daily life.

'These injuries, some of which may be permanent in nature, have caused her, and continue to cause her pain, suffering, inconvenience, humiliation and interfere with [her] normal and usual activities and have caused her permanent scarring all to her noneconomic damage in an amount to be determined by a jury, but are currently estimated not to exceed $250,000,' the lawsuit states.Ruddell said she has about $25,000 in medical bills so far because of her injuries. The lawsuit claims Rose should’ve known that the duck could be violent, and that the Oregon woman should be on the hook for negligence and the medical bills.

'As the possessor of a domestic animal that the defendant knew, or had reason to know, had abnormally dangerous propensities in attacking people in an aggressive manner similar to how it attacked and injured Mrs. Ruddell, defendant is strictly liable for all injuries her duck caused Mrs. Ruddell' the suit goes on to say.

Ruddell's lawyer, Gregory Price, said it was his understanding that Rose had her duck killed after the incident.

Rose could not be reached for comment on the case.

Price said he expects the damages will ultimately be paid by Rose's insurance policy, but filing a lawsuit was necessary as a precaution because of continuing medical bills from a second surgery on his client's wrist and a two-year statute of limitations on such claims.

Along with the lingering effects of the attack, the legal case has brought Ruddell a measure of unwanted attention, her attorney said.

'I've learned a lesson,' he said. 'In any future lawsuit I'll talk about my client being attacked by a domestic animal. Not by a duck.'
