A Florida high school teacher who had sex with his 16-year-old student at least 'seven to ten times' and plied her with drugs and alcohol has avoided prison time.

James Wolfe, 31, was sentenced in March to two years of house arrest and five years of probation -  despite being caught on tape admitting to the relationship and telling her, 'I  know it mess you up.'

The girl was wearing a wire when she met with Wolfe following his August 2013 arrest. According to police, she asked him why he had sex with her when she was just a teenager. He responded: 'Because I thought I cared about you.'

Wolfe was a popular English teacher and cross-country coach at Matanzas High School in Palm Coast, Florida. His victim was one of the students he coached.

Authorities say the plea deal will allow the girl to avoid having to take the stand and confront the man who seduced her, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reports.

She told police that she had sex with Wolfe 'at least seven to ten times' between August 2010 and May 2011 - when she was just 16.

'During each incident the victim stated that she felt compelled to engage in sexual acts with Wolfe because of his position of authority over her,' detectives wrote in the arrest report.

The victim said the first time she and Wolfe had sex, he plied her with an unknown narcotic drug to calm her nerves and also gave her alcohol. 

Once, drove her to a nature preserve used by the school for field trips. He set up a tent in the woods and had sex with her inside it.

The relationship ended shortly after an April 2011 incident in which she and Wolfe had sex at his apartment and fell asleep. They were both awakened when Wolfe's girlfriend came home unexpectedly and found them in bed together.

Even though the sexual relationship took place in 2010 and 2011, the girl didn't report it to police until August 2013 - when she was 18. He continued to teach students, coach cross country and draw a salary of $38,000 a year, according to FlaglerLive.com.

After filing a report, officers took Wolfe in for questioning. He denied the relationship and asked for a lawyer.

But, the victim contacted Wolfe in a phone call recorded by police and asked to meet him.

She wore a wire when they met up in the parking lot of Red Lobster and was recorded admitting to the affair.
