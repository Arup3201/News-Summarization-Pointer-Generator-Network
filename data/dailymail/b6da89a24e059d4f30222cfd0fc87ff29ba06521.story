To welcome the summer in, and thanks perhaps to the recent rise in popularity of the 'butt selfie', one New York spa has started offering a facial specifically for your hind quarters.

The 'Shiney Hiney Facial' costs $65 for a 30 minute treatment at the Brooklyn-based Skin By Molly, and involves a microdermabrasion-like exfoliation along with a peel and a steam.

'Hey, skin is skin, I got no judgment,' says owner Molly Lamb to Brokelyn. 'Acne can flare up anywhere.'

'Most people with facial acne will develop acne on other parts of their body as well, including the buttocks,' medial aesthetician Giselle Curcio writes on her blog, TheskinY On Skin, also mentioning exfoliation as being a good treatment.

And you only have to do a quick scour of online forums to see how surprisingly common a case of butt acne is, one message board featuring this gem from a concerned husband: 'My wife would kill me if she knew I was posting this but ever since I can remember she has ALWAYS broke out on her BUTT.'

Ms Lamb's Shiney Hiney Facial is obviously best suited for bikini wears (and Victoria's secret models) brave enough to don the sorts of itsy-bitsy swimwear that leave little to the imagination.

And with the 'Brazilian Butt Lift' soaring in popularity across the U.S. over the past few years, it's no surprise that women are keen to polish up their rears in the same manner as their faces.

Almost 10,000 buttock augmentation procedures were carried out last year, a 16 per cent rise since 2012, according to The American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

And on-cue, celebrities all over Hollywood have been eagerly snapping their bodacious bottoms for all of social media to see, with stars Nicki Minaj, Rihanna and Miley Cyrus among the most avid butt-posers.

But for those not local to New York's pioneering bottom facialist, fear not: skin is indeed skin, and most spas should be able to take on the challenge.
