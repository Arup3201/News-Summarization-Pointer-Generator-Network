A man locked in his eighth-floor apartment by his wife tried to escape by climbing from the window using bed sheets tied together. 

The Estonian man, 35, is lucky to be alive after he was seen climbing down the makeshift rope and had successfully climbed down one storey when the bed sheets gave way in Lasnamäe, in the Tallinn district, Estonia.

He told police that his wife had locked him in the apartment but that he wanted to go meet his friends and so had decided to escape.

Great escape attempt: An eyewitness captured the dramatic moments as a man attempted to escape from his eighth-floor apartment using bed sheets tied together. He managed to climb one floor down before his makeshift rope gave way

Eyewitness Yekaterina Horoshko caught the dramatic escape attempt on camera as he fell about 70 feet.

She told Postimees: ‘He began descending from the eighth story. He succeeded climbing one storey down, but the sheet didn’t withstand the weight at the seventh storey.’

The man fell into bushes at the bottom of the apartment block but was able to walk to the ambulance when it arrived.

Police spokesman Ilmar Kahro said: ‘The 
man said his wife locked him in. Wanting to go meet his friends, he 
decided to escape from the apartment with a rope made from bed sheets.’

In another escape attempt caught on camera, teenager Jacob Gutierrez hung on to a chair-lift for six minutes before falling 45 feet onto the rocky, snow-capped mountains below after he lost his footing.

He was left with liver damage, a broken skull and collapsed lung in the fall on February 2 as he fooled around trying to throw a snowball at friends on another chair.

The terrifying moment has been watched by more than 1.6million people on YouTube.
