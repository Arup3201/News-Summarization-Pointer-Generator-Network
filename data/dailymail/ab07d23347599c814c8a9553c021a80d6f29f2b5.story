Passenger satisfaction with Britain’s rip-off railways is plummeting as inflation-busting fares soar, a report by watchdogs revealed yesterday.

Less than half of rail users believe they get value for money – significantly down on a year ago – dropping to nearly a quarter on the worst-performing routes.

Passengers, recently hit with fare rises of up to 11 per cent, expressed increasing dissatisfaction with the soaring cost of tickets, poor punctuality, overcrowding, and rail operators’ inability to deal with delays.

Overcrowded and late: Less than half of passengers believe they get value for money from Britain's rip-off railways

The rail consumer watchdog Passenger Focus, which surveyed 30,590 travellers last autumn for its annual study, found massive differences in customer satisfaction levels depending on the area in which they were travelling.

Overall, 46 per cent of all passengers are satisfied with the value for money of their ticket, compared with 49 per cent last year. But this slumped even further with specific train operators and routes.

National Express East Anglia gave the least ‘value for money’ satisfaction (33 per cent), followed by Southeastern (36), Heathrow Express (37), South West Trains (38) and First Capital Connect (38).

The worst-performing route for value for money was the Stansted Express airport link into London Liverpool Street station (27 per cent satisfaction).

The next worst was the National Express East Anglia mainline service to Ipswich and surroundings (28), followed by the National Express West Anglia route to King’s Lynn via Cambridge (30) and  South West Trains’ routes around Surrey and Hampshire (32).

Michael Roberts, of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ‘We recognise value for money scores remain lower than others and the whole industry needs to focus on tackling costs as well as improving services.’

But he blamed government policy for soaring fares. ‘Successive governments have pursued above-inflation fare rises to reduce taxpayer subsidy while ensuring ongoing investment in the railways,’ he said.
