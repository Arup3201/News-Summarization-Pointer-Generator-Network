Victim: Volunteer William Pooley is believed to have contracted virus from one-year-old boy

The British nurse infected with Ebola may have caught the deadly virus after playing with a one-year-old boy whose mother had died from the disease.

William Pooley, the first Briton to contract the virus, had spent his free time keeping little Sellu Borbor occupied at the remote treatment centre in Sierra Leone where he was a volunteer after the toddler had initially tested negative.

But a colleague said the boy had in fact caught the virus from his mother’s breast milk and died last Sunday – the same day that the 29-year-old Briton was diagnosed.

Mr Pooley was flown back from Sierra Leone at the weekend and is receiving the experimental drug ZMapp in a London hospital.

Last night, a leading health official warned that the outbreak sweeping West Africa would get worse after it was reported that a third top doctor in Sierra Leone had died from ebola.

Close to 1,500 people have so far died across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the worst epidemic since the disease was first identified 38 years ago.

During his time at the clinic in eastern Sierra Leone, Mr Pooley developed a bond with Sellu, according to his supervisor Finda Josephine Sellu.

Like other health workers, Mr Pooley initially took precautions handling the infant since the boy’s mother was diagnosed with the virus and later died. But he played with him freely after the baby tested negative for the disease, she said.

‘Pooley and some other nurses fell in love with the boy and would play with him in their free time,’ she said.

Sellu was tested again after he developed a fever and tested positive for ebola the second time around. He died on August 24.

It is not clear why the initial test result came out negative, although experts say the virus can sometimes go undetected and they recommend several tests. Another nurse known to have played with the boy has also tested positive for the disease.

The Kenema clinic where Mr Pooley worked is known to be understaffed and several staff there have succumbed to the illness. A government official announced yesterday that another doctor, Sahr Rogers, who was working alongside Mr Pooley, had contracted ebola and died.

Last night, a spokesman for the Royal Free Hospital in London said the Briton’s condition had not changed since Tuesday, when doctors said he was in ‘good spirits’ and was sitting up and talking in his isolation chamber.

Despite the situation in Sierra Leone, the outbreak is worse in Liberia, which has recorded the highest number of cases and deaths. After visiting the country, Dr Tom Frieden, the director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said the situation was dire.

He said treatment centres were struggling to deal with the influx of patients and added: ‘I wish I didn’t have to say this, but it is going get worse before it gets better.’

France is recommending that its citizens leave Sierra Leone and Liberia following the ebola outbreak, while Air France has temporarily suspended flights to Sierra Leone at the request of its government.

It will maintain flights to Conakry in Guinea, with measures in place to guarantee that no passengers ‘presenting symptoms’ can board.

The United Nations says the lack of flights to the affected area is making it increasingly difficult to bring in much-needed supplies.
