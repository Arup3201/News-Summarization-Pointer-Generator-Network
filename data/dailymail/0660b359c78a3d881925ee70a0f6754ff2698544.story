After riding in a self-driving Toyota Prius to Google
headquarters on Tuesday, Gov Jerry Brown signed legislation paving the way for
driverless cars throughout the state of California.

The bill by Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla will establish
safety and performance regulations to test and operate similar autonomous
vehicles on state roads and highways with the vehicles expected to hit the market in a decade.

'Today we're looking at science fiction becoming tomorrow's
reality - the self-driving car,' Brown said. 'Anyone who gets inside a car and
finds out the car is driving will be a little skittish, but they'll get over
it.'

Google Inc. has been developing autonomous car technology
and lobbying for the regulations. The company's fleet of a dozen computer-controlled
vehicles has logged more than 300,000 miles of self-driving without an
accident, according to Google.

'I think the self-driving car can really dramatically
improve the quality of life for everyone,' Google co-founder Sergey Brin said.

Autonomous cars can make roads safer, free commuters from
the drudgery of driving, reduce congestion and provide transport to people who
can't drive themselves, such as the blind, disabled, elderly and intoxicated,
Brin said.

'I expect that self-driving cars will be far safer than
human-driven cars,' Brin said.

The future: Gov Brown signed the bill that will work to establish safety and performance regulations to test and operate similar autonomous vehicles on state roads and highways

Brin predicted that autonomous vehicles will be commercially
available within a decade. He said Google has no plans to produce its own cars,
but instead plans to partner with the automobile industry to develop autonomous
vehicles.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers expressed concern
that California is moving too quickly to embrace self-driving cars and needs to
first sort out liability issues.

'Unfortunately this legislation lacks any provision protecting
an automaker whose car is converted to an autonomous operation vehicle without
the consent or even knowledge of that auto manufacturer,' the trade group said
in a statement.

Autonomous cars use computers, sensors and other technology
to operate independently, but a human driver can override the autopilot
function and take control of the vehicle at any time.

With smartphone-wielding drivers more distracted than ever,
backers say robotic vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce
collisions and traffic fatalities, noting that nearly all car accidents are a
result of human error.

The legislation requires the California Department of Motor
Vehicles to draft regulations for autonomous vehicles by Jan. 1, 2015.
Currently, state law doesn't mention self-driving cars because the technology
is so new.

The regulations would allow vehicles to operate
autonomously, but a licensed driver would still need to sit behind the wheel to
serve as a backup operator in case of emergency.

The legislation also is aimed at keeping California at the
forefront of the autonomous car industry since Stanford University and Silicon
Valley companies have been working on the technology for years.

Manufactures: The technology placed inside a seen Toyota Prius is one of several car makers working on autonomous car technology, including Audi, BMW, Ford and Volvo

In February, Nevada became the first U.S. state to approve
regulations spelling out requirements for companies to test driverless cars on
that state's roads.

Carmakers such as Audi AG, BMW AG, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo
have been working on autonomous car technology for years.

In recent years, automakers also have been introducing
autonomous functions such as self-parking, lane departure warnings and adaptive
cruise-control, which allows vehicles to automatically accelerate and
decelerate with the flow of traffic.

Outside a cafe in Mountain View, customers said they looked
forward to a day when their cars could drive themselves, as long as they could
do it safely.

Expectations: Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, pictured beside Gov Brown, believes self-driving cars will be safer than those driven by people, while expecting them on the market within the next decade

'It would make our streets safer,' said Barrett Howard, 33,
an auto technician. 'We wouldn't have to worry about people texting or getting
sidetracked. The computer will take over, and it will make life easier.'

Abraham Eshel, a retired mechanical engineer who has vision
problems, said self-driving cars would make his life easier, too.

'If I could tell my car, "OK, you take over when it's dark,"
and I don't have to worry about it, that would be fantastic,' said Eshel, who
lives in nearby Los Altos. 'It's a good idea. Why not make progress if it's
possible?'
