A maths student who died after an allergic reaction enjoying a meal at a burger bar with friends is thought to have told staff of her intolerances before eating, an inquest heard.

Shahida Shahid, 18, was taken to intensive care when she collapsed in Manchester city centre after eating at trendy eatery restaurant Almost Famous last Friday night. She died three days later.

Initial tests revealed the cause of death was brain damage caused by a severe allergic reaction.

Miss Shahid, who had a number of food allergies and was asthmatic, told staff of her dietary requirements and they advised her that a chicken dish would be appropriate, police understand.

But the dish is thought to have contained, or was cooked in, one of the ingredients to which she was allergic, DI Chris Flint, of Greater Manchester Police, told the inquest yesterday.

Miss Shahid, a first-year student at the University of Manchester, collapsed at 8.30pm on Friday. Unlike many allergic reactions, however, Miss Shahid did not suffer from symptoms immediately. 

She and friends ate in the city's Great Northern Warehouse shopping centre and paramedics were only called when she reached The Printworks, another shopping centre half a mile away. 

Manchester Coroner's Court heard how Miss Shahid, from Salford, Manchester, suffered 'irreversible and unsurvivable' brain damage and died three days later.

DI Flint said: 'We understand, although it is not entirely clear, that she indicated to waiting staff what her allergies were and what meal would be appropriate for her.

Symptoms: Miss Shahid, above, who had a number of food allergies as well as being asthmatic, started to feel unwell shortly after finishing the meal

'She was advised that a particular chicken dish would be appropriate and that was ordered and consumed.'

'It is understood the dish did contain or was cooked in one of the ingredients she was allergic to.'

Miss Shahid, who had a number of food allergies as well as being asthmatic, started to feel unwell near The Printworks shortly after finishing the meal, the inquest heard.

When it became apparent she may have eaten something she was allergic to, she used her inhaler and her epi-pen, which gives a shot of adrenaline to treat severe allergic reactions.

But they had no effect and she collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest.

An ambulance was called shortly after 8pm and she was taken to the A&E at Manchester Royal Infirmary before being transferred to the intensive care unit. She died on Monday.

The post-mortem examination revealed the provisional cause of death was hypoxic encephalopathy (damage caused to the brain by oxygen starvation) due to anaphylaxis - a severe allergic reaction.

DI Flint told the inquest that the force had launched a joint-investigation into the incident with the Food Standards Agency.

He said laws surrounding information that businesses have to provide to people with allergies had changed last month - and Almost Famous was 'aware' of this.

Coroner Nigel Meadows said the investigation into Shahida's death, despite being in its early stages, was a 'timely reminder' to the food industry about the significance of providing information to customers with food allergies.

He added: 'The law has relatively recently changed and new regulations came into force in August and more new EU regulations in December.

'This case clearly serves as a timely reminder to the food industry regarding these requirements.'

Friends of Shahida, who attended the local Walkden High School and Winstanley College, paid tribute to the teenager on social media, describing her as 'beautiful, brilliant and kind'.

Her devastated cousin, Farjana Alam, wrote on Facebook the day before Shahida died that she was in intensive care with brain damage.

'Everyone please keep my cousin in your prayers,' she wrote. 'She is in the ICU, has gotten brain damage, and she isn't being responsive - every prayer counts xx.'

Following the death, Farjana posted: 'To God we belong and to God we return. My beautiful, brilliant, kind, loving cousin has passed away.

'Please everyone keep her in your prayers - I still cannot believe she's gone and my heart aches with pain that she has left the world.

'May Allah grant her mercy and take her to the highest of Jannah - everyone please pray for her and her family's strength.' Others paid tribute to the teenager on social media. 

Just a month ago the FSA launched new EU rules on how customers should be told about allergens in outlets which don't usually label food, such as restaurants and sandwich bars.

Restaurants must now label 14 main substances which can cause an allergic reaction on their menus.

They are gluten, fish, shellfish, egg, peanuts, other nuts, soy beans, milk, celery, mustard, sesame seed, sulphur dioxide, lupin and molluscs.

Marie Carter, company director of Almost Famous, said: 'We're absolutely devastated to hear the tragic news that this young lady has passed away. Our thoughts are with her family and friends.

'As the authorities are conducting investigations it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'
