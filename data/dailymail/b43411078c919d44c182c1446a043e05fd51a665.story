Glen Davis, who is HIV positive, is accused of forcing his girlfriend to have unprotected sex with him after pouring gasoline over her

A HIV-positive man forced his girlfriend to have unprotected sex with him after pouring gasoline over her, police say.

Glen Davis is accused of telling the unidentified woman 'You're gonna die one way or another' before the sexual assault.

He had accused her of cheating on him and also threatened to set her teenage son on fire.

Davis, 48, from Winter Haven, Florida, was arrested on Saturday after the alleged attack on Halloween.

He
has been charged with criminal transmission of HIV, battery, false 
imprisonment, two counts of arson, two counts of aggravated battery and 
sexual assault.

Police said Davis threatened to set her alight after grabbing her neck and dousing her with gasoline.

All the doors were locked and he prohibited the use of cell phones, the woman told police.

She told investigators he also held scissors to her throat before forcing her to have unprotected sex.

The woman told police she begged him to use a condom but he refused.

Davis is also accused of pouring gasoline over the kitchen table and setting it alight.

His girlfriend told Bay News 9: 'I seen my life flash before my eyes right there.

'The house filled up with smoke. Fire and smoke and we couldn't get out.'

The police report states that she knew of her boyfriend's HIV status but the couple had always used protection.

He is currently being held at the Polk County Jail on a $70,000 bond.
