Seizures of methamphetamine soared at the US-Mexico border during fiscal year 2014.

Meth seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection's San Diego field office accounted for 63 percent of all meth seized at land, air and sea entry points nationwide.

That amounts to a whopping 14,732 pounds of the drug seized just in San Diego through the end of September.

'The Mexican cartels are flooding the U.S. marketplace with their cheap methamphetamine,' Gary Hill, DEA assistant special agent in charge in San Diego, told the San Diego Union-Tribune.

Almost all meth used to be produced in the United States and San Diego was a production hub.

But the U.S. cracked down with laws limiting access to the synthetic ingredients, and now it's cheaper and easier to make it in Mexico.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 90 percent of meth in United States now comes from Mexico. 

Drug cartels find it cheaper to make meth than smuggle cocaine from South America. 

'The overhead is tremendous for cocaine,' Hill told the Union-Tribune.

But for meth, he added, 'the overhead is minimal.

'They oversee the manufacturing. There is no middleman.' 

Production is mostly controlled by the violent Sinaloa cartel and Knights Templar, which also control smuggling routes along the California border, the newspaper reported.

'That's our supposition,' Hill said.

'They control the gateway at San Diego and they seem to be the ones who are most involved in manufacturing the methamphetamine, so it kind of goes hand-in-hand.'

The 2014 fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
