Inter-school wars are nothing new in the UK.

Since private school was invented, children's uniforms have marked out clear sides in the battle of supremacy between state and publicly educated pupils. 

Now a Twitter account called Private School Life is documenting the differences between paid-for and state-funded schools with amusing yet snobby accounts of life in of Britain's most elite classrooms. 

Twitter account Private School Life documents life at a public school in a series of both snobby and amusing posts 

@PRIVATESCH00L has been active since February, but the person posting the tweets has so far remained anonymous.

With some of the snootier posts likely to rile state school pupils, the decision to withhold their identity is probably a wise move. 

One of the more contentious tweets include: '"So excited for half term." Haha we are already on it you pleb.' 

But most of the posts just provide a humorous  insight into the differences between different types of education in the country, especially the dress code that is required at a private institution. 

One reads: 'You know you go to a private school when your headmaster insists on wearing Dracula's last remaining cape to assemblies.' 

Another says: 'You know you go to private school when no one gets expelled, they just quietly get asked to leave.'
