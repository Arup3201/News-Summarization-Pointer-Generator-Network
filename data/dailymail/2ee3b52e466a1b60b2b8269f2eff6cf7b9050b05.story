A self-portrait taken by pioneering photographer Oscar Rjelander - believed to be the world's first selfie - sold at auction for £70,000. 

The important photograph, which dates from the 1850s, predates the modern craze by almost 200 years.

It was discovered in a leather-bound book of 70 albumen prints by the renowned Swedish artist.

This self-photograph of Oscar Rejlander  taken in the 1850s is believed to be the world's first ever 'selfie'

When the owner approached Morphets auctioneers in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, they said they had no idea of the real value of the book. 

Liz Pepper Darling of Morphets said:  'The vendor brought the album into the office, and asked for it to be sold with a reserve of £100.

'We quickly realised it was quite an important album of early photographs, when the art was really in its infancy.'

Among the sitters in the album are Rejlander's wife, Hallam Tennyson - the son of poet Lord Alfred Tennyson, and Rejlander himself.

The first photographs were developed by French inventor Nicéphore Niépce who in 1824 creates the first permanent photograph. 

However the word photography was only first used in 1839 by Sir John Herschel after he created the first glass negative.  

The first Kodak camera was produced in 1888 allowing 'ordinary people to take photographs

Rejlander, who started out as a portrait painter before moving into photography, became well known for his photomontage print 'The Two Ways of Life'- made up of 32 negatives - which caused a scandal because of the partially nude subjects, although respectability came again when Queen Victoria bought a copy of the print for Prince Albert.

Rejlander sold the album of 70 prints to 19th century naval hydrographer Captain George Browing, and it was passed down through the family to most recent owner, who the auctioneers said had no inkling of its significance.

Although individual prints have come to market in the past, the album is thought to be the first work by Rjelander ever sold in public. 

Queen Victoria purchased a copy one of Rejlander's photomontage prints for her husband Prince Albert
