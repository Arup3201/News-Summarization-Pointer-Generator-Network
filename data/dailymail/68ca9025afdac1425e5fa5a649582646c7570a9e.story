Weight-loss programmes can really help obese youngsters shed the pounds – but only if started early enough, new research suggests. 

Overweight children under 10 had much slower weight gain than teenagers who received similar interventions such as a change in diet and exercise habits, say scientists from the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.

‘The results are indeed alarming for severely obese adolescents, who run a serious risk of disease,’ said Claude Marcus, professor of paediatrics at the Institutet. 

Excessive pounds in childhood often stay on into adulthood, where they have been linked to heart disease, diabetes and other health problems

‘New treatment methods must be developed and for some young people, surgery must even be considered an option.’

Excessive pounds in childhood often stay on into adulthood, where they have been linked to heart disease, diabetes and other health problems.

The Swedish report was published alongside Dutch research in the journal the Archives of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine.

The Dutch scientists found that heavy three- to five-year-olds saw continued benefits from a weight-loss intervention at least several months after it ended.

Commenting in the journal on both studies, Dr Elsie Taveras, a paediatrician at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, said: ‘What [these studies] are showing is a pretty consistent trend that if we intervene early, we could really have an effect on changing the trajectory of weight gain in children.

She added there is mounting evidence that paying attention to young children may be a promising way to stem the global obesity epidemic.

In 2008, more than a third of U.S. children were either overweight or obese, according to official figures. 

The numbers have also been on the rise in Europe, although they are still lower than in the U.S.

The Dutch researchers, led by Dr Gianni Bocca of Beatrix Children's Hospital in Groningen, studied 75 heavy children who had been randomly assigned to get either usual care or an intensive weight-loss program.

The program lasted four months and involved 25 sessions with dietary advice, exercise and, for the parents only, behavioural counselling.

A year after the study began, children in the weight intervention group had lost one unit of their body mass index, while the others saw no change.

‘The magnitude of the effect, especially initially after the intervention, wasn't very large, but what needs to be taken into account was that these children were growing,’ Dr Taveras told Reuters Health.

‘What these interventions are showing is that you can have an effect, and hopefully these interventions are changing the trajectory the children were headed towards.’
