Jockey Jamie Moore is confident champion chaser Sire De Grugy will return to the track in top form as he continues his recuperation from a minor operation.

The eight-year-old gelding, trained by his Moore’s father Gary, won four grade one races last season including the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival and both the Tingle Creek and Celebration Chase at Sandown.

The Tingle Creek is again seen as the first major target of the season for the French-bred chestnut.

Operation: Jamie Moore is confident champion chaser Sire De Grugy will return to the track in top form

Jamie Moore, who has been unveiled as the ambassador for the Jockey Club’s London racecourses, Kempton and Sandown, this winter said: ‘The Tingle Creek is definitely part of the plan for Sire de Grugy and following his operation, he seems really well.’

A potential clash with 2013 Champion Chaser Sprinter Sacre in the Tingle Creek is on the cards.

Nicky Henderson’s gelding missed most of last season after suffering a Fibrillating heart and being pulled up at Kempton’s Christmas meeting.

He is back at Henderson’s Lambourn stable and being gradually brought back into full training.
