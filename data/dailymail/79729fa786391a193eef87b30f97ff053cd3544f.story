Police have released CCTV images of a recent sighting of a wanted man suspected of murdering his ex-girlfriend.

Michael Cope, 28, has been on the run since the body of Linzi Ashton, 25, was discovered with multiple injuries at her home in Winton, Salford, on June 29.

Miss Ashton made separate complaints to Greater Manchester Police in April and May that Cope had raped and beaten her.

Suspect: Greater Manchester Police have released this CCTV footage of Michael Cope, wanted on suspicion of murdering his ex-girlfriend Linzi Ashton. Officers say he withdrew cash and bought food at the store in Wigan

Cope was caught on camera at a 
convenience store in Atherton Road, Hindley, Wigan, at about 1.25pm on 
Sunday, where he withdrew cash and bought food.

The public have been warned not to approach the Salford man as they believe he may be armed and is dangerous.

The search was focused on Salford but has now widened to the Wigan area.

Murdered: Linzi Ashton was found at her home on Westbourne Road, Winton by relatives. A post-mortem found that Linzi died as a result of pressure to the neck and multiple injuries

Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Shenton said: 'It has now been almost three weeks since Linzi’s murder, since which officers have been working very hard to find Michael Cope.

'We have kept Linzi’s family updated on the investigation and we are also grateful to the communities of Salford for their ongoing cooperation throughout the course of our enquiries.

'However, I would now urge the people of Hindley and Wigan to help our investigation if they can.

'If you have seen the man pictured, please call us. I would also ask that people in this area remain vigilant.

'We believe Cope is familiar with the canal pathways between Salford and Leigh and may have spent time near the canal and waterways in Hindley.

'He may have been sleeping rough and we would urge people to report any suspicious behaviour around outbuildings, sheds or gardens, as well as disused railway lines and open land.

'However, in their vigilance we would like to remind people that if Cope is seen he is not to be approached, as we do believe that he is dangerous and could be armed.

'Anyone who sees him should call the police immediately.

'We understand these developments may alarm people in Wigan but I would like to reassure them that we have a dedicated team of detectives, and specialist search officers, whose sole objective is to find Cope safely. 

The suspect was wearing a black baseball cap, shorts and a t-shirt. Miss Ashton made separate complaints to Greater Manchester Police in April and May that Cope had raped and beaten her

'Our appeal to the public is to be vigilant, and to let us know if they have seen the man pictured.

'Patrols by local officers are being stepped up, and members of the public can raise any concerns with them.'

Greater Manchester Police has named Michael Cope 28, as the man they want to speak to over the 'brutal' murder

A reward of £25,000 is on offer for anyone with information that leads to the arrest and conviction of Cope.

Miss Ashton’s body was discovered by a relative at her home in Westbourne Road.

She was last seen alive at a friend’s house at 2am on the Saturday.

Her two daughters, Daisy, aged two, and Destiny, seven, were not at the address at the time.

A post-mortem found that Linzi died as a result of pressure to the neck and multiple injuries.

Two men have already been charged in connection with Linzi’s murder.

David Sargeson, 26, of Eccles, has been charged with perverting the course of justice.

Craig Blackburn, 25, also of Eccles, has been charged with assisting an offender.

A 27-year-old man arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender has been bailed until August 15 pending further enquiries

The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating the prior contact made by Miss Ashton to Greater Manchester Police.

Anyone with any information on Cope can call police on 0161 856 5092 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
