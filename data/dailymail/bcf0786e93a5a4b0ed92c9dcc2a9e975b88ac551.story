The 36-year-old woman believed to have been swept out to sea in Brighton ran into the water, it has been revealed.

A
 major search operation was launched yesterday after the female went into the water following a 'night out' in the popular seaside resort.

However, it was later called off due to poor weather conditions - with coastguard personnel failing to find any trace of her. 

Search: Emergency services were called to a nightclub in Brighton (above), East Sussex, at 2.20am yesterday

Response: Rescue personnel talk to a swimmer following reports that a woman had been swept out to sea

Reports: The 36-year-old woman is believed to have been overcome by rough seas and three-metre waves

Now, police have revealed the woman -
 who has not yet been named - ran into the rough seas in the East Sussex
 resort while strolling along the shore with a friend.

Her male companion attempted to rescue her, but was thrown back by three-metre waves.

A 
 Sussex Police spokesman said: 'The woman had been walking along the 
beach between West Pier and Palace Pier with a man who she knew when she
 ran into the water and was almost immediately swept off by a large 
wave.

'The man tried to grab her but was unable to drag her to safety.

Alert: Police, ambulance and coastguard personnel attended the incident in the popular seaside resort (above)

'Police
 officers arrived within minutes and together with club staff and her 
friend approached the sea edge, but the woman was being washed further 
away and was inaccessible due to the very heavy sea conditions.'

He added it was not known why the woman - who is believed to be from Brighton - had decided to run into the stormy water.

Emergency

 services were called to Digital Nightclub on the seafront at 2.20am 
yesterday following reports that a woman had gone into the water.

Police, ambulance and coastguard personnel attended the scene, according to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).

A helicopter from Lee-on-Solent was also used to search for the missing woman, alongside a Royal National 
Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat based in Shoreham, West Sussex.

Scene: The woman deliberately ran into the water following a night out in a club on the seafront

However, Solent Coastguard later stood down following an 'exhaustive' search of the water.

Yesterday, a spokesman said the matter had been left in the hands of the police.

He
 said: 'We conducted a thorough search of the area and nothing was 
found. The conditions down there are appalling. It's force eight with 
severe gale warnings.'

'Gale
 force wind, rough seas and darkness make it difficult to spot a person 
in the water who needs help, so our request is simple - please don't 
end your night out with a dip.

'Cold water and powerful seas mean that it's really not as much fun as you might think.'

Sussex Police said the woman's next of kin have been informed of the incident.

Chief
 Superintendent Nev Kemp said: 'Police and Coastguard searched for 
several hours in very difficult and dangerous weather but have been 
unable to locate the woman.

'We will continue to be vigilant for any sightings along the beach.

'The
 sea was very rough overnight, and we always urge people to be very 
careful and stay away from the waters edge anywhere along the coast when
 the weather is so bad.'

Coastguards
 carry out daily patrols along the seashore in the area, but confirmed 
that this morning's checks had not got them any closer to finding the 
woman.

Any witnesses to the incident who have not yet spoken to Sussex Police are asked to contact them.
