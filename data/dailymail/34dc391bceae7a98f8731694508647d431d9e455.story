A college lecturer landed in court after standing up to bullies who attacked her young son in the street.

Shannon Sibley, 48, was charged with a breach of the peace after her nine-year-old son was punched and had abuse hurled at him by a group of teenagers.

Miss Sibley, from Carfin, Lanarkshire, took her car out to find those responsible and confront them after her son had been reduced to tears.

The mother-of-two caught up with her son's tormentors, who had been selling sweets in her housing estate, and after a heated exchange returned home.

But she was reported to the police after a witness saw the incident on May 20 last year.

Miss Sibley, a senior lecturer in travel and tourism at Anniesland College in Glasgow, appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court where she pleaded guilty to the offence.

But Sheriff David Bicket gave her an absolute discharge and told her he 'understood' the reasons for her actions after hearing the case.

Today, Tory politician Margaret Mitchell MSP blasted prosecutors for allowing the case to reach court.

She said: 'I think the sheriff has looked at all the mitigating factors and decided that there wasn't a reason to punish this woman despite the position taken by prosecutors that a crime had taken place.

'I can't help but sympathise with her and feel that the sheriff certainly came to the right decision by dealing with the case with an absolute discharge.'

Depute fiscal Fiona Kirkby told the court how the incident had unfolded.

She said: 'The accused's son, aged nine, was involved in an incident with the complainer, a young male aged 13.

'He came home and was very upset. The complainer and a group of friends had been selling sweets round houses in the area.

'After her son returned home, the accused then got into her car and arrived at the locus and confronted the complainer.

'She asked him why he assaulted her son and shouted 'How would you like to be bullied' and similar utterances.

'The accused was extremely angry. A female witness who had been buying sweets from the complainer split the confrontation up.

'The witness then tried to note Miss Sibley's registration down as she drove away at which point she opened the car window and shouted her address to the woman.

'The witness then attended to the boy who was shaken by the incident and it was reported to police.'

Defence lawyer Heather McCracken said: 'Miss Sibley's son was playing in the street outside their home with a friend.

'The complainer and a number of his friends made certain taunts and offensive remarks to the nine-year-old child who was wearing a green top.

'Miss Sibley's son was then hit and he returned home. The group who were involved in the altercation were not from the area and were selling tablets and sweets round the doors of the estate.

'She took her son in the car to find the boys who were responsible for the assault. When she confronted the boy, she was told to f*** off.

'She then felt threatened by a forward movement by the complainer and made a pushing away gesture.

'Miss Sibley is a college lecturer and holds a high up position in the education authority and has assisted children affected by poverty.

'To say this episode has had a profound effect on Miss Sibley is an understatement.'

Miss Sibley said: 'This has cost me thousands of pounds and caused great upset. I don't want to talk about it.'

Sheriff David Bicket said: 'I am satisfied that this was a one off incident and although I do not condone it I understand the explanation behind the offence. I am discharging you absolutely.'
