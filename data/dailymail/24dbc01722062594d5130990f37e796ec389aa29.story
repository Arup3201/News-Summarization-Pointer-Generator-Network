Chelsea captain John Terry has heaped praise on Blues team-mate Petr Cech for the way he has handled losing his first-team spot to Thibaut Courtois.

Jose Mourinho has decided to drop Cech to the substitutes' bench in order to provide Courtois with the chance to impress at the west London outfit.

Courtois has so far managed to live up to expectations by putting in two solid performances against Premier League new boys Burnley and Leicester City which has raised doubts over Cech's future at the club.

Terry, who is delighted with Cech's level of professionalism, believes Chelsea are in a fantastic position as they have two of the world's best goalkeepers  at their disposal.

The Chelsea centre-back, speaking to the Daily Mirror, said on Cech: 'It is very hard to take for big Petr but he is Chelsea through-and-through and has been unbelievable in the way he has responded in training – and in his attitude.

'Some players throw their toys out the pram and Petr, 100 per cent has not done that, he is fighting for his place and he has been here a long time.

'He still feels like he wants to stay here and fight for his place.

'We have got two of the best keepers in the world. Petr has done it for many years and if Thibaut can replicate that it will take some doing.'

Cech has been linked with a move to Ligue 1 duo Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco in recent weeks, however Mourinho is keen on keeping hold of the Czech Republic international.
