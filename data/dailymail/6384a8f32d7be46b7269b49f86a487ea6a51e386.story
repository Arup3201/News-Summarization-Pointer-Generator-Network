Old Navy is introducing a new style of jeans coined 'skinny' and 'boyfriend' jeans for their children's line and some mothers across the country are deeming the styles inappropriate.

The Gap owned affordable clothing chain touts jeggings, super skinny, skinny, boot-cut, and boyfriend skinny among its new looks.

The jean styles for children are 'mini me' versions of the adult style of women's jeans which also include options like the diva, the flirt, and the sweetheart.

Too young?: These young girls are modeling the new Old Navy boyfriend jean which is causing concern among some parents and psychologists

Trendy or too much?: Old Navy argues they are merely mirroring their adult styles of jeans in a playful way 

'Why not just call them 'loose fit?’' said Janet Choi, 41, a mother of two from Bushwick to the New York Daily News.

Another mother added that the term skinny jean may urge some children to worry about their weight prematurely.

ABC reports that a New York City psychologist said that the term 'boyfriend' shouldn't be applied to young children because they may feel the need to grow up too fast.

'Can’t we just buy jeans because we like them, and not have the ‘boyfriend’ label associated with them?,' said Joe Taravella, PhD and supervisor of pediatric psychology at Rusk Rehabilitation at New York University Langone Medical Center.

'It sets up our children to want and need a boyfriend, when at these early ages, this terminology should not be part of their vocabulary or on the radar of what they should be thinking about,' Taravella told ABC News.

'I am hard-pressed to understand why the label 'boyfriend' was associated with these jeans.'

The New York Daily News also spoke with a psychologist who argued that insinuating romantic relationships in children's fashion may cause them to 'grow up too fast.'

'It’s another unfortunate example of how sexualization is getting younger and younger,' says Dr. Jennifer Hartstein, a child psychologist in Manhattan.

New styles: Parents are outraged about the new boyfriend jeans for girls deemed too young to have a boyfriend or think about romantic relationships

'It’s not so much the existence of the boyfriend jean that’s the problem. It’s the message that girls will pick up,' Hartstein adds.

'At (age) 2 she may not be so aware, but as she gets older, she will start to internalize these messages,' she says.

ABC News spoke with the founder of Big City Moms, a resource center for New York based mothers with over 300,000 members.

'I think it’s just being true to their style names,' Leslie Venokur told ABC News.

'My kids don’t know what the style is called. I give them jeans and if the jeans are comfortable, they wear them.'

Venokur who has children aged two and six says that the marketing is aimed at parents buying their children clothing modeled after their own style.

'Do they need to change it? No,' Venokur said

'If they want to appease some opinionated parents, then that’s their call.' 

The New York Daily News reports that other comparable children’s designers don’t call looser pan 'boyfriend jeans.'

H&M calls theirs 'denim pants' or 'loose-fit jeans.'

OshKosh B’gosh and Gymboree don’t even offer the style. Abercrombie does sell boyfriend jeans, but only for older girls.

Despite the complaints among some parents the brand does not plan on changing their whole campaign. 

Perfect or potentially harmful?: While some parents think the style is inappropriate, other moms claim their kids don't pay attention to the advertisements
