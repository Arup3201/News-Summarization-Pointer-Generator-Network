Two men were shot at Prestons, just over an hour after the attack in Auburn which has the mother of convicted murderer Bassam Hamzy in hospital with serious stomach wounds. Police are investigating the links between three separate incidents in less than 24 hours across Sydney's west and south-west which led to one man's death and three others in hospital in serious condition 

In a separate incident at Prestons in Sydney's south-west, two men were also shot, one of them stumbling into the foyer of a local Catholic club to seek help. Police are looking into whether the shootings are all linked.

However, police now fear that a war between rival crime syndicates is imminent after the brutal killing of Youssef Assoum, 29, whom they believe to be a member of a rival gang. 

An off-duty officer found him lying in a pool of blood in the early hours of Thursday on Claribel Street at Bankstown. He had been shot in the head and stabbed several times in the chest.

Authorities, fearing an all-out war between crime syndicates, are investigating if there are any links between his slaying and the attacks on three others, including the mother of crime boss Bassam Hamzy, which has them in hospital in serious condition

NSW Police said: 'At 8.40pm, police and emergency services attended a property on Albert Road in Auburn after reports of a shooting'.

'Upon arriving at the scene, emergency services personnel attended to a woman who was suffering from a gunshot wound to the stomach.

'The woman, aged in her fifties, was treated at the scene before being transported to Westmead Hospital.

'Officers from the Flemington Local Area Command have established a crime scene at the woman’s property on Albert Road and an investigation into the shooting is now under way.

'Initial inquiries suggest that the woman was injured after a number of bullets were fired through her front door. She was home alone at the time of the shooting.'

It has been alleged recently that Bassam Hamzy, who was sentenced to life in jail for a 2002 murder, ran the 'Brothers 4 Life' chapter from within maximum security with a mobile phone smuggled in six years ago. He reportedly made more than 19,000 calls in less than 2 months ordering murders, kidnappings and drug deliveries.

His cousin Mohammed was also recently found to have access to a mobile phone while in Silverwater Jail.

NSW Homicide Squad detectives have been investigating several incidents involving the Hamzy family including the fatal shooting of Mamhoud Hamzy last year. The mother of gang founder and convicted murdered Bassam Hamzy was shot in the stomach on Thursday night in what's believed to be a retaliatory attack

Bassam Hamzy's mother Lola is the latest to apparently be caught up in gang crossfire after his aunt Maha Hamze suffered eight gunshot wounds in a drive-by shooting last year. 

Among the allegations heard in court earlier this year against Hamzy was an order, from inside his prison cell, for his gunmen to attack a Melbourne home because of an unpaid drug deal worth $45,000.

NSW Police are looking at the possibility that a drug deal gone wrong between rival gangs led to the confrontation in the third incident.

They stated that, at 10.30pm on Thursday, officers were called to Hoxton Park Road in Prestons 'after a man, suffering a gunshot wound to one of his arms, stumbled into the rear foyer of a licensed club'.

'Emergency services attended the location and the man, aged in his twenties, was transported to Liverpool Hospital for treatment,' police stated.

'A short time later, another man presented at Liverpool Hospital, having sustained a gunshot wound to his shoulder.

'Police believe the shootings of both men may be related.'
