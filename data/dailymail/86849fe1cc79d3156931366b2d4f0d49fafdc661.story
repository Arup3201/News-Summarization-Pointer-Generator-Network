Graziano Pelle took one touch with his right boot to flick the ball to shoulder height while already beginning to swivel on his standing leg.

In one fluid motion he flung his body into the air, twisted acrobatically and sent the ball flying into the top right-hand corner.

Ryan Bertrand, on loan from Chelsea, put Southampton ahead in the second half before Charlie Austin struck a surprise equaliser with a piece of individual brilliance.

The South Coast club dominated the game, striking the upright twice and keeping Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green busy all afternoon.

But they needed something special to eventually break through and their £8million summer signing, brought in for the daunting task of replacing Rickie Lambert, provided it. 

‘I often do these things during training,’ a nonchalant Pelle explained afterwards.

It was said with the swaggering confidence of a striker who has taken no time adapting his game to English football. He has netted five goals in eight games already.

There were reservations about Southampton manager Ronald Koeman raiding former club Feyenoord for the Italian when they lost Lambert to Liverpool.

Players so often flourish in Holland but cannot reach those levels when they face the demands of the Barclays Premier League. 

‘I’ve got experience enough now to realise where I am,’ Pelle added.

‘I have to be honest, it was not so easy in the beginning.

'However I was lucky I came to England a month before the start of the season, then I had a long time to adapt myself.

‘All the games are difficult, all the teams, from the lowest to the top, are always good; good organisation, strong and fit.’

As manager of Feyenoord, Koeman plucked Pelle from Italian side Parma. During his two seasons in Holland he scored 50 goals in 57 league games. ‘He is learning fast,’ said the Dutchman.

Charlie Austin’s goal ended QPR’s barren run of nine hours and 15 minutes without a goal away from home in the Premier League. 

‘In the first two weeks I told him, “It’s not Holland”. In Holland if you bring 70 per cent of your physical effort you will win the battle.

‘In the Premier League you have to bring more than 100 per cent, and he’s doing that. Then you see how good he is as an attacker.’
