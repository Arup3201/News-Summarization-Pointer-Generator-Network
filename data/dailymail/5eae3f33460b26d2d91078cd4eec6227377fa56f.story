The selfie-taking tourist who was kicked in the head as a train sped by him has broken his silence over the ordeal.

Jared
 Michael, from Regina, Saskatoon, claims he was making his way to Macchu Pichu, in Peru, when the
 train's engineer taught him a valuable lesson but did not hurt him very
 much.

He dismissed to 
CTV speculation the video was a Jimmy Kimmel hoax, and also that 
the engineer was trying to save his life since he wasn't on the front of
 the train.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

He got the boot!: Jared Michael (pictured left only a few days ago and right at Macchu Pichu earlier this year) was kicked in the head by a train engineer while trying to take a selfie

He also tried to defend his actions by saying a previous train passed by at a much slower speed.

'The
 train definitely wasn't going the same speed as it was the first time. 
It was going normal train speed,' he told the network. 'That's why the 
video starts within, like, a second of me getting kicked in the head.'

Michael
 is shown standing beside the tracks just as the train approaches and he
 meets the business end of the engineer's black leather boot.

'I pressed play and was going to look at where the train was, but by that time, I already got kicked in the head,' he lamented.

The
 Canadian claimed the drop kick did not hurt was more of a shock than 
anything else. He also doubted the engineer's intentions towards helping
 him avoid more serious injury, or even possible death.

'He
 wasnâ€™t on the front of the train,' said the somewhat embarrassed man. 
'He was on four feet off the front of the train kind of a thing.

'So if the train was going to hit me, it was going to hit me before his boot ever reached me.'

Despite not believing the conductor had good intentions, he did sheepishly admit how silly the video has made him look.

'Honestly,
 even the truth is a little ridiculous and it does make me look stupid,'
 he said. 'But it was an accident and I got it on film and I think it 
would have been a shame to just throw it away.'

Speaking to the Leader Post, Michael dismissed the criticism he has received around the world for the humiliating boot.

'I ignore it, they're just faceless people on the internet,' he told the paper. 'I never really understood the term 'I love haters' until now.

'If I wasn't the one in the video, I'd be making those comments too.'

Uploading the video to YouTube,
 Michael attempted to explain that he 'tried to take a selfie while a 
train passed a 'safe' distance behind'. But conceded, 'I guess I was 
still too close and got kicked in the head. I messed up'.

However, despite his 
admission of a lesson well-learned following the engineer's justified 
swing, Michael's first reaction as captured in his video is amazement.

Instead
 of saying 'Ow!', or 'Maybe I was too close to the train', Michael 
exclaims, 'Wow! I got kicked in the head! I think I got that on film!'

Smack: The boot of the conductor connects cleanly with the young man

Follow-through: The train speeds past and the young man's head feels the full force of the conductors boot

But, before everyone 
holds this up as another example of the extreme lengths people will now 
go to for the perfect selfie, some have joked they see the hand at work 
of America's prankster in chief, Jimmy Kimmel.

Indeed,
 Cooper Fleishman, the editor of the Dailydot tweeted that he would find
 it amusing if the video was revealed to be a set-up, filmed on an ABC 
studio lot and that the engineer was in fact Kimmel.

But this has since been proven not to be the case.

The
 ABC late-night host has a past history for viral internet pranks - 
during the Sochi Winter Olympics he managed to get a picture of a wolf 
roaming the athletes village to go viral.

In fact it was a fake, but that did not stop multiple outlets running with the image.

That really hurt: The young man feels his face after his kick

He claims the video is real and that he did not expect the train to come up on him at such a high rate of speed
