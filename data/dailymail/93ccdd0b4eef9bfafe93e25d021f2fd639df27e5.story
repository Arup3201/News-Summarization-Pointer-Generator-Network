Paper is handy for shopping lists, toilet roll and good old-fashioned books. But paper make-up? I don’t think so.

But that shows how little I know because it seems that the latest beauty must-have looks like a pad of Post-it notes.

Mai Couture Papiers are sheets of paper infused with foundation, blusher, highlighter and bronzer — all you have to do is sweep the paper over your face for a flawless finish.

The idea is that you use them to top up your make-up during the day or you can even use them instead of your usual products for a sheer, natural make-up look. Brilliant for on the go make-up, the papers replace your make-up bag with a product that can fit in your pocket.

They are all contained neatly inside a wallet so they are lightweight and compact and won’t spill all over your handbag.

They also have the added bonus of acting like blotting papers — favoured by make-up artists to absorb excess oil from the face to reduce shine — and an alternative to applying pressed powder to matte the skin which often looks cakey. It sounds too good to be true — like another gimmick designed to relieve us of our money. I decide to try them.

The sheets of foundation powder cost £12.50 for 50 sheets — one is enough to cover the whole face. This works out at 25p per sheet, so slightly cheaper than my usual £26.55 bottle of Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation, which lasts three months.

But still, I am sceptical. My skin can be blotchy and red, so I like my foundation to be thick and creamy.

I’m of the ‘more is more’ school when it comes to a base — I don’t believe a tiny square of tissue paper will give me the coverage I want.

I sweep the foundation paper all over my face, pressing more firmly where I need more coverage.

I must admit that it goes on easily and smoothly and gives more coverage than I was expecting, but it is too powdery.

It collects on the dry skin on my chin and forehead, I keep trying to blot and blend with the paper but, as a result, I keep putting more powder on, which is not what I want.

And even though I use the palest of the three shades available, it’s a bit too orange for my skin. So far, so unimpressive.

Next I try the trio pack of blusher, bronzer and highlighter sheets.

I’ve never got on well with bronzer. I prefer to stay pale and interesting and on the couple of times I’ve tried it, my skin colour looks fake and Essex-y.

Not with this one. Because the powder on the sheets is so fine — it’s talc free — it goes on so lightly that you barely notice it, but it gives a gorgeous soft glow with a slight shimmer.

I love it, but not as much as I love the highlighter sheets. Like bronzer, I’ve never got the hang of highlighter.

I have tried a product called High Beam by Benefit — which comes in a nail varnish-like applicator — but it’s messy and I lost patience with it, but this is totally different.

I fold up the paper and blot it on the top of my cheekbones — and voila! The result is soft, but illuminating. No mess, no streaks. It’s so easy.

Finally, I pat the blusher paper on the apples of my cheeks.

I apply a shade called Sunset Boulevard — and with one papery push my cheeks are the prettiest, most natural glow. I can honestly say it’s the best blusher I’ve ever tried.

The overall effect was a revelation. I’m still not crazy about the foundation, but it blends well with the bronzer, blush and highlighter. I feel as if I’m not wearing any make-up, but my skin looks even and luminous. Mai Couture don’t do any eyeshadows, but I’m told the bronzer can also double as one.

Mai Couture don't make a lip colour yet, Marianne (pictured) tested the papers out on her lips but although it looked nice initially, it quickly came off

It works a treat — I dab it on quite heavily to get the most colour of it and use a brush to blend it.

It’s super fine and sits on my skin perfectly, giving some definition to my eyes without looking too heavy.

They don’t do lip colour either, but I try the blush sheets on my lips to see what happens.

I choose a darker blusher sheet and though it looks pretty it comes off within minutes.

The next day I try a light dusting of the foundation sheet on top of my usual cream foundation and the effect is perfect — lightly matte, with a soft glow.

Throughout the day I blot my skin with the foundation powder and the blusher, even doing it on the train without a mirror, and it works a treat.

A revolution for practical make-up on the go and ideal for those of us who suffer from an oily complexion, paper make-up is more genius than gimmick.

From now on I won’t leave home without my little book of powdered paper.
