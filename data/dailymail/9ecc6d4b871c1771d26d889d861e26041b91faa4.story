Accident: British racing driver Sean Edwards was killed in a horror crash on an Australian racing circuit

A young British racing car driver who starred in the hit film Rush has died in a car crash on an Australian race track.

Sean Edwards, 26, was a passenger in a Porsche when it reportedly hit the side of the race track at Queensland Raceway in Willowbank, west of Brisbane, during a private test session this morning.

The driver, a 20-year-old man from Brisbane, was pulled from the burning wreckage and is in intensive care with life-threatening injuries.

Mr Edwards, who was born in London, but lived in Monaco, is the son of 1970s F1 race car driver Guy Edwards.

Inspector Dave Preston, from Queensland Police, said it had been a difficult operation to get Mr Edwards and the driver out of the smashed up super-car.

He told local media: 'The fire and rescue had to do extensive work in relation to extracting and opening the vehicle up sufficiently to remove him, he was trapped for some time.

'When I last went down there and he was being removed he [the driver] was awake and aware of what was going on around him.

Porsche said the Supercup Championship leader was sitting in the passenger seat as an instructor in a private driver training session when he was killed.

Rescue: Local emergency services spent two hours extracting the driver - a 20-year-old man from Brisbane - from the burning wreckage, but Mr Edwards is thought to have died instantly  

Tragic: The incident occurred on Champions Way just after 11:30am local time

The
rising star had a role in the Formula 1 film Rush, playing his father who is renowned for pulling Niki Lauda from the wreckage of his burning Ferrari following the Austrian's crash at the Nurburgring in 1976.

Mr Edwards' family and his girlfriend Laura have not yet commented on his death.

Mr Edwards' Twitter page suggests he became engaged in the summer - 
Laura posted a photo of a diamond ring on the social networking site 
next to the words: 'Thank you #diamonds #areagirls #bestfriend.'

Earlier this month Mr Edwards wrote on his Twitter page next to this photo: 'Saw @rushthemovie last night, really great movie well done @RealRonHoward you did an amazing job. Dad says the same!'

Only a few days ago she tweeted Mr Edwards asking if he missed being at home.

In his last post on Twitter he said: 'Time to hit Queensland Raceway today, should be fun, hope there aren't too many kangaroos like at Bathurst!' - a reference to Australia's premier endurance auto racing event last weekend. 

Edwards is currently leading this year's Porsche Supercup standings, a series which supports Formula One at a number of grands prix, with a double header looming in Abu Dhabi next month to conclude the campaign.

'The tragedy of it is he was leading the Supercup championship after such strong performances through the middle of the year. It looked like he was going to win.

'Also, having won the Nurburgring 24 Hours this year (with Mercedes), I would say this was probably his strongest year in racing.'

The Motor Sports Association (MSA) said today it is 'shocked and saddened' by the death of Mr Edwards.

A statement said: 'Sean was a hugely promising young racer who came through the junior formulas in Britain, before making a career in international sportscar racing.

'He is leading the 2013 Porsche Supercup championship and had won both the N|rburgring and Dubai 24 Hours this year.

'The MSA extends its deepest sympathies to Sean's family, friends and fans at this difficult time.'

Hartmut Kristen, Head of Motorsport at Porsche, said news of the accident 'has sparked immense regret at Porsche.'

Our thoughts are with his family and we want to express our deepest condolences to his relatives.'
