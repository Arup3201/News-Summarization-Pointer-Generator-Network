A Florida woman, who suspected her roommate of using her things, discovered him torturing her cat after hiding a secret camera in her bedroom, according to police

Alanna Jenkins bought a secret camera disguised as an alarm clock to try and catch her roommate, Jordan Scott Bean, 25, going into her room while she was working.

But rather than just moving her belongings around or using them, she actually discovered something much worse - he was allegedly beating her 2-year-old cat.

Tortured? Alanna Jenkins' cat Chompers, pictured with her owner, was violently abused by Jordan Scott Bean, according to the police. The pet owner took video footage she secretly took of Bean, her former roommate, to the police station

Bean was arrested yesterday after police were handed the footage from the Boca Raton shared home.

According to the arrest report, officers claim the footage shows Bean wrapping the cat called Chompers in a towel, choking and shaking her.

'I thought he was just going through my stuff or doing something that he shouldn't be doing,' Ms Jenkins told Inside Edition.

'I saw him violently abusing my cat,' she claims. 'He would wrap her up in my blanket and cover her face and he would strangle her, get on top of her and choke her'.

Cruelty? Jordan Bean claims he was playing with Chompers on the video, pictured, but the cat's owner and the police claim she was being violently beaten

Wrestling: Chompers is wrapped in a blanket and tries to escape. Police claim Jordan Bean knew he was hurting the cat rather than innocently playing

According to the police report he also slams the animal onto the bed.

'You can hear the cat hissing, moaning and wailing at him,' a Boca Raton officer wrote in the report.

'[Bean] gets on his hands and knees while carrying a towel attempting to corner the cat."

Police claim the cat tries to hide from Bean in a closet but he finds her and climbing into the closet too.

Happier times: Chompers, pictured with her owner, was assessed by an animal clinic but had no injuries following the incident. She is now back home with Ms Jenkins who has thrown out her old roommate

Concerned: Alanna Jenkins, left, said she found her belongings had been moved when she was at work so she put in a secret camera to monitor her roommate Jordan Bean, right

'I was able to hear Bean meowing while inside the closet mocking the cat,' an officer writes in the report.

The pet tries to fight her alleged attacker but he smothers her with his hands and then allegedly sits on her head, according to officers

Bean told police he was just playing with the animal while police say he 'intentionally committed an act to Chompers which resulted in excessive and repeated infliction of unnecessary pain and suffering'.

He has been charged with animal cruelty and was released on bail. If convicted he could face a year in jail plus a $5,000 fine.

Chompers was given a clean bill of health by a local animal clinic and was released to her owner.Â
