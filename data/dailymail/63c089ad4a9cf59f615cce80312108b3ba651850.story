A federal appeals court has blocked the scheduled execution of a mass killer convicted of eight slayings that shocked South Florida in the 1970s.

The decision by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals came during a flurry of legal decisions over claims that 64-year-old John Errol Ferguson suffers from mental illness so severe he cannot be executed.

Ferguson, a paranoid schizophrenic with delusions that he's the 'prince of God,' had faced a planned lethal injection at 6 pm yesterday in Florida's death chamber.

Life behind bars: John Errol Ferguson, 64, has been on Death Row for 34 years for killing eight people in the 1970s. He was due to be put to death on Tuesday before receiving a late stay of execution

The U.S. Supreme
Court quickly upheld the stay of execution.

Ferguson has spent more than three 
decades on death row for eight brutal killings, including those of a 
teenage couple, in 1977 and 1978.

The Supreme Court had initially rejected an emergency appeal by Ferguson earlier on Tuesday - as did the 11th Circuit - before making its later ruling. The state of Florida failed in its bid to overturn the decision.

The appeals court set a schedule for motions that will likely delay the execution until at least the first week of November, if not longer.

Victim: He raped and shot Belinda Worley, 17, as she went for ice cream 
with her boyfriend in January 1978. Her boyfriend was also shot dead

Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's 
office argued in court papers that the late ruling 'makes a mockery of 
the state's compelling interest in finality' in Ferguson's case. He has 
been on death row for 34 years.

In Washington, the nation's high 
court noted that Chief Justice John Roberts took no part in the case. 
There was no further explanation.

Ferguson was convicted of shooting 
eight bound and blindfolded people execution-style in South Florida in 
1977, then killing a teenage couple months later in 1978 after they left
a church event planning to get some ice cream.

He has previously been ruled mentally
competent to be executed, and over recent days federal judges in 
Florida, Georgia and Washington have wrestled with his appeals over that
issue.

The execution was scheduled after the
Florida Supreme Court this month upheld a lower court ruling based on 
testimony by a panel of psychiatrists appointed by Governor Rick Scott.

The state justices wrote that 'Ferguson understands what is taking place and why.'

The latest ruling from the federal 
appeals court said it would explore whether the Florida Supreme Court's 
decision was an 'unreasonable determination of the facts' based on 
Ferguson's documented history of mental illness.

His lawyers have argued that Ferguson
lacks rational understanding, because he suffers from delusions that 
he is the 'prince of God' and that God is preparing him to return to 
Earth after his execution to save the United States from a communist 
plot.

Ferguson was convicted of two sets of murders and is suspected in a third.

In 1977, he and two accomplices 
fatally shot six people at a Carol City home, then the worst mass 
slaying in Miami-Dade County history.

Even more shocking was Ferguson's 
murder of a teenage couple who had left a church event in Hialeah in 
1978 and never met up with friends they planned to meet for ice cream.

Legal wrangling: Ferguson has been granted a stay of execution following a late court ruling

John Errol Ferguson was sentenced to death for eight killings in 1977 and 1978, although some investigators believe he killed even more.

May 1977: An elderly couple were found beaten, tied up and shot dead in their motel room. The gun was used in Ferguson's later crimes but he was not charged as there was no other corroborating evidence.

July 1977: With three others, Ferguson broke into a house and tied up eight people and shot them in the head. Livingstone Stocker, 33, Michael Miller, 24, Henry Clayton, 35, John Holmes, 26, Gilbert Williams, 37, and Charles Cesar Stinson, 35, all died. Two survived: Johnnie Hall, 45, and Margaret Wooden, 24. He was convicted of the killings.

October 1977: Posing as a police officer, he shot two teenagers during an attempted robbery. They survived.

January 1978: Shot and killed Brian Glenfeldt, 17, on his way to get ice cream with his girlfriend, Belinda Worley. Belinda, 17, was raped and also shot. He was convicted of the killings.

In the 1977 case, Ferguson pretended 
to be an electric utility worker to gain access to the Carol City house,
which police said was a local hangout for marijuana dealers whom the 
bandits wanted to rob of drugs and cash.

Former Miami-Dade prosecutor David 
Waksman said most of the victims were friends who happened to drop by 
the house while Ferguson and the other men were there.

The victims were blindfolded and 
bound, but the encounter turned violent after a mask worn by one of 
Ferguson's gang fell off and his face was spotted by a victim.

The decision was made to kill all 
eight people in the house, said Waksman, now a legal adviser to a local 
police department. They were shot one by one. Two managed to survive.

Almost six months later, passers-by 
spotted the bodies of Brian Glenfeldt and Belinda Worley, both 17, who 
had been fatally shot. Worley also had been raped. Her jewelry was 
missing along with cash from Glenfeldt's wallet.

Trial testimony showed the couple had
stopped at a romantic 'lovers' lane' when they were approached by 
Ferguson, dressed as a police officer. Ferguson shot Glenfeldt in the 
car and Worley tried to flee but was caught.

The randomness of the crime and the 
youth of the two victims stunned many in Miami, then a slower-paced 
place that was yet to become the infamous 'cocaine cowboys' murder 
capital of the 1980s.

Ferguson confessed to killing 'the two kids' after he was arrested in April 1978 for the earlier murders, court records show.

Worley's mother, Edna Worley, waited 
for decades for Ferguson's execution and often said that 'if she could, 
she would pull the switch,' her son Michael 
Worley, told The Miami Herald.

Edna Worley died in May, according to her son.

He said: 'She planned on attending the execution. She wanted to be there for her daughter.'

Ferguson was sentenced to die in both
cases; he unsuccessfully used the insanity defence in the trial over 
the teenagers' murders.

Fate: Ferguson was due to be put death in Florida State Prison by lethal injection at 6pm yesterday

Waksman said the gun he used was also
traced to the killings of an elderly couple slain outside a Miami 
motel, but he was never charged with that crime because there was no 
other corroborating evidence.

The two accomplices in the 1977 
slayings, Beauford White and Marvin Francois, were found guilty in 
separate murder trials and were executed in the 1980s.

A third man, who stayed in the car 
the entire time, pleaded guilty to lesser charges and testified against 
Ferguson and the other two.

It has been 34 years since Ferguson 
was first sentenced to die. That is longer than many on death row but by
no means the record in Florida.

Corrections Department records show 
several inmates have been on death row since the early 1970s and one 
first got there in 1967.
