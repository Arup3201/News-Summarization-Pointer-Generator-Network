Opera singer Katherine Jenkins ran the London Marathon on Sunday wearing light make-up, while Fern Britton tweeted photographs of herself bare-faced before and after a spin-class.

But it seems the majority of women in Britain lean more towards Katherine's way of thinking than Fern's.

Some two-thirds of women admit wearing beauty cosmetics in the gym, despite recent findings that you burn fewer calories during a work-out if you do.

While Fern appeared hot, sweaty and completely au naturel, the majority of British women would not  do the same, instead copying Katherine, who ran the marathon (and raised an impressive £25,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support) in light make-up.

Despite recent findings that women work out less effectively if wearing make-up in the gym, almost two thirds of women said they would wear some form of make-up when exercising: 55 per cent said they would at least wear light make-up, and a further 11 per cent said they would almost always wear full make-up.

A fifth of women (20 per cent) would wear full face make-up for a marathon or public fun-run, and well over half (62 per cent) would at least wear a light dusting of mascara and lipstick .

Fewer than one in five women (18 per cent) would go bare-faced on a public fun-run, and 44 per cent said they would apply some form of beauty products for just a quiet jog around their local park.

Beauty expert Emma Leslie from Escentual.com, the online beauty retailer who commissioned the survey, said: 'British women always want to look their best in public, and the gym is one of the big social meeting places for people these days.

'Also, there have been several 
innovations with waterproof make-up recently, products that breathe with
your skin when you work-out and will stay absolutely perfect even when 
you are pushing yourself hard physically, so it's much easier to look 
good working out.

'Most women are likely to be at the gym for at least an hour; so you want to look your best just in case you bump into someone you know... or someone you might like to know.

'And if you are trying to tone up bits of your body about which you might feel a bit self-conscious, you don't want to add to that by not feeling the best about your face.'

The research found that the gym wasn't the only place that British women were likely to wear make-up.

The majority would wear full make-up for a trip to the shops (67 per cent), and 30 per cent would wear light make-up. Only three per cent wouldn't wear any at all.

When doing the school run, over half of mothers wear full make-up on most occasions (52 per cent), 40 per cent wear at least light make-up, and only eight per cent wouldn't wear any.

Understandably, a job interview yielded the most affirmative responses: 99 per cent of women would wear some form of make-up, and over three quarters of them (76 per cent) full make-up.
