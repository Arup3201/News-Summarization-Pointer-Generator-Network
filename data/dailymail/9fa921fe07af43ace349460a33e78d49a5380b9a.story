One of the most iconic pens in the world is finally fighting back against the iPad by launching a universal stylus.

Bic is swapping its plastic stopper for a touchscreen stylus in the new version of its famous biro, Bic Cristal, which has sold 115 billion since the first one made in 1945.

The 6mm Cristal Stylus will replace the end of the pen which, traditionally, has been chewed by millions of users from schoolchildren to crossword solvers for generations.

The 6mm Crystal stylus has been designed to work at any angle on any touchscreen. The company boasts that it will write for 'up to three kilometres'

The Cristal Stylus is a reaction by Bic to the growing use of technology from smartphones to iPads, which has left many traditional pens forgotten in the back of desk drawers

A
range of Bic pens designed specifically for women has fast become one 
of the most sarcastically reviewed product on Amazon.com.

Bic,
the ballpoint pen manufacturer, launched its 'Bic Cristal for Her' line
last year, but a new wave of customer comments has sparked fresh 
interest in the product.

The site says the pen has a 'thin barrel to fit a women's hand', and an 'elegant design - just for her!'

The
product, which is available in an array of pastel hues, is being 
marketed in a serious way, but the ridiculous concept has not gone 
unnoticed by shoppers, with dozens of consumers posting hilarious 
remarks.

The French firm will launch the £2.49 
stylus in supermarket chains Sainsbury and Asda from August, following 
its launch online at sites such as Amazon this month.

The pen has
been designed to work at any angle on any touchscreen. The company 
boasts that it will write for 'up to three kilometres.'

The design is a reaction by Bic to the 
growing use of technology from smartphones to iPads, which have left many
traditional pens forgotten in the back of desk drawers.

In the 1950s, the Bic pen was introduced to America where it became a hit as an alternative to messy and fussy ink pens.

Bic became so famous that its design has been included as a permanent display in New York's trendy Museum of Modern Art.

An interior design studio in Madrid also used the design to create the Bic chandelier made
entirely from Bic Cristal pens.

The Bic Cristal was invented as a super-thin free flowing pen by Baron Marcel Bich after the war to cash in on the newly invented Biro (it needed a licence from Biro to operate.)

As a result of its popularity, schools eventually allowed children to use Bics and other biros in the classroom. It now claims to sell 59 pens every second of every day.
