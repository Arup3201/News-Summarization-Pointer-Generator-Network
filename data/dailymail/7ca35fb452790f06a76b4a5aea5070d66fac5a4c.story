It's the sort of poise and self-assurance  in front of the camera shown only by Hollywood veterans and top models. But this is Silver Linings Playbook actress Jennifer Lawrence as a teenager, displaying a maturity beyond her years.

These pictures, from the Oscar-winning star’s private portfolio, were taken when she was aged 14 and 15 and pursuing a modelling career.

Self-assured: Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence in modelling shots taken when she was aged between 14 and 15

And Jennifer must have been wishing she had looked so self-assured when she famously stumbled as she walked on to the podium to collect her Best Actress Oscar in February. Despite her tender years in these photos, she already had a fearless streak.

She not only turned down a number of early modelling offers, but as a 15-year-old she stormed out of a meeting at a top showbusiness agency in New York – because a receptionist was rude to her.

Photographer and agent Chris Kaufman, who took these pictures, says there was never any doubt that Jennifer was headed for stardom. He said: ‘When I first took her picture, I stopped shooting and turned to my assistant and said, “You don’t see people move like that.”

I just thought, “Where did you get this ability?” She’s always had such natural talent.

She’s always wanted to act and I’m not surprised that she’s got to be where she is today. It’s been a meteoric rise. She went from appearing in TV sitcoms to the big screen very quickly.’

He added: ‘Jennifer is absolutely fearless. She’s the kind of girl who tells you what’s on her mind.’

Jennifer, now 22, grew up on her family’s ranch in Kentucky and was first spotted as a 14-year-old by a modelling agency talent scout in Union Square, New York.

‘I was offered a number of contracts soon afterwards but turned them down,’ she has said. ‘That was an incredibly dumb thing to do but was probably the one time when my self-assurance paid off.’

She is now one of Hollywood’s most sought-after stars after her success in romantic comedy Silver Linings Playbook.

She is due to appear on screens again  later this year in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.
