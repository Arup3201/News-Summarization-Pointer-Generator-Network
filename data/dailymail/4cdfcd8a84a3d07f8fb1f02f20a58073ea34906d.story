Samsung may be considered Apple’s biggest rival, but a Chinese firm wants to steal this crown.

Xiaomi has announced its next-generation flagship phablet - called Mi Note - and said it is larger, thinner, lighter and cheaper than Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus.

During the launch event, the firm also poked fun at Apple’s raised camera.

The Mi Note from Chinese firm Xiaomi has a 5.7-inch display, is 6.95mm thick and weighs 161g. This makes it 0.2-inches larger, 0.15mm thinner and 11 lighter than Apple's iPhone 6 Plus (comparison pictured)

In December, four-year-old Xiaomi became the world’s most valuable startup.

It has been criticised in the past for producing phones that are similar to Apple’s range of handsets, leading to the company being dubbed the ‘Apple of China’.

At Xiaomi’s press conference to announce the Mi Note, the firm made regular and direct comparisons to the iPhone 6 Plus, including placing the two phones side-by-side on presentation slides.

For example, Xiaomi’s Mi Note has a 5.7-inch display, compared to the iPhone 6 Plus’ 5.5-inch screen.

Both phones have the same screen resolution, but because Xiaomi’s is slightly bigger, it has fewer pixels per inch than Apple’s handset - 386 PPI versus 401 PPI respectively.

The firm also poked fun at Apple’s raised camera on the iPhone 6 Plus (right). Xiaomi'sMi Note has a 13MP rear -facing camera and a 4MP version on the front. The iPhone 6 Plus has an 8MP on the rear, and 1.2MP on front

However, a premium model of the Mi Note, expected to launch in March, is said to have a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440, with a PPI of 515.

Xiaomi didn’t go into great detail about the other specifications of the premium model, but did say it should cost around CN¥3,299 (£350/$530).

The 6 Plus is 7.1mm thick, while the Mi Note is 6.95mm.

Price-wise, Xiaomi’s model (left) starts at CN¥2,299, which converts to around £244 or $370. Apple sells its iPhone 6 Plus (right) without a SIM for £619 in the UK and $949 in the US. Mi Note is covered predominantly in glass and is on sale in China now. An international release schedule has not been announced

Apple's head of design hit out Xiaomi at the recent Vanity Fair New Estalishment Summit in San Francisco. 

Asked what he felt about the company being described as the 'Apple of China', Sir Jonathan Ive criticised them for copying his company's designs.

'I don't see it as flattery,' he said, 'I actually see it as theft.' 

Sir Jonathan  said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals. 

Xiaomi’s flagship is also thinner, 6.95 mm compared to Apple's 7.1mm, and is lighter, weighing 11g less.

Price-wise, Xiaomi’s model starts at CN¥2,299, which converts to around £244 or $370. Apple sells its iPhone 6 Plus without a SIM for £619 in the UK and $949 in the US.

And Xiaomi offers a better range of cameras on its Mi Note, too - 13MP rear and 4MP front - than Apple’s device.

Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus has an 8MP on the back, and a 1.2MP on the front.

Other features include a glass-covered body, which is said to be able to survive a steel ball drop test, a dual-SIM port and a skinned version of Android. 

However, the Mi Note is only currently on sale in China, and an international release schedule has not been announced.
