Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel was named the Sports Commentator of the Year at the Comment Awards on Tuesday.

The award completes a hat-trick for Samuel, who is also the current SJA and the Press Awards Sports Writer of the Year.

Known for his hard-hitting, razor sharp opinion on the biggest issues surrounding sport, Samuel picked up his gong from the Editorial Intelligence event on Tuesday morning.

Samuel joined the Daily Mail in 2008 and is often on Sky Sports' Sunday Supplement programme, presented by Neil Ashton.

He has tackled a number of pressing issues over the last year, including Nicolas Anelka's quenelle gesture and eventual axe from West Brom, the World Cup, the fall-out from England's calamitous Ashes tour in Australia last winter and most recently covering Lewis Hamilton's Formula 1 world title win in Abu Dhabi.

Samuel also brings a debate to MailOnline Sport every week, answering questions from readers from his previous columns.

He picked up the SJA and the Press Awards' gongs for 2013 in March this year.

Samuel has won the Sports Journalist Association Sports Writer award on five separate occasions.
