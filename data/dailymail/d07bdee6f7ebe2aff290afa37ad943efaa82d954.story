The family of the Rutgers University student who killed himself after his roommate used a webcam to spy on him kissing a man has visited the scene of his suicide for the first time.

Tyler Clementi's parents and brother crossed The George Washington Bridge on Sunday to help raise awareness about the dangers of bullying.

Clementi's mother and brother linked arms and walked with members of a group called The Friend Movement who had walked from Chicago to New Jersey in Tyler's memory.

The 18-year-old Clementi killed himself in 2010. His death sparked a national conversation about the treatment of young gays.

Clementi's roommate Dharun Ravi served less than a month in jail. He is appealing his conviction on invasion of privacy, bias intimidation and other counts.

Tyler Clementi jumped to his death from a bridge after discovering his sexual encounter with another man had been streamed live to other students by a roommate.

He was said to be distraught before plunging from the George Washington Bridge into the Hudson River in New York. He left a post on his Facebook page saying 'jumping off the gw bridge sorry'.

The sex session was broadcast on September 19. A second broadcast was made two days later.

Soon after Ravi is alleged to have axed his Twitter account where he made a cryptic September 22 reference to his roommate asking to have their room to himself.

Three days before Mr Clementi's alleged suicide, Mr Ravi posted on his Twitter account saying he had secretly filmed the 18-year-old.
