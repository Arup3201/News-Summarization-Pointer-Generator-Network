A sick toddler died in hospital after he was denied a potentially life-saving test because it was ‘not normally done’ at weekends, an inquest heard yesterday.

Doctors did not give two-year-old Dylan Brown a test for heart disease.

They said he showed no symptoms of heart failure and they believed he was suffering from a virus. But the toddler later died after suffering three cardiac arrests in hospital.

Dylan Brown died in Hillingdon Hospital (pictured), Uxbridge, west London, on May 13 last year after suffering three cardiac arrests

An expert said his treatment would have been different if the echocardiogram (ECG) test had been given.

It would have revealed Dylan’s underlying heart problem and would have meant he was given a different drug.

But his consultant paediatrician, Dr 
Nagi Barakat, told the inquest the test ‘was not done because it was the
 weekend and they are not normally done at the weekend’.

And Dr Shankar Sridharan, the heart 
specialist who said Dylan’s treatment would have been different if the 
ECG had been given, also said there was no clinical evidence at the time
 to suggest the toddler needed this test.

Coroner Lorna Tagliavini said 
Hillingdon Hospital in Uxbridge, West London, had not failed and said 
Dylan was treated ‘appropriately’.

As attempts were made to resuscitate the toddler, his parents were not allowed into the room with him

But his family said ‘big mistakes’ 
were made and blamed out-of-hours shortages. After the inquest, his 
grandfather, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The whole NHS just closes
 up shop at 5pm on Friday and doesn’t open up again until Monday 
morning. It is disgraceful: don’t get sick at the weekend.

Dylan was admitted to Hillingdon Hospital with breathing difficulties and cold-like symptoms on Wednesday, May 9 last year.

He was vomiting and his heart was 
beating quickly but staff thought he was suffering from a virus and did 
not give him an ECG test, which uses soundwaves to create a picture of 
the heart. He had an underlying muscle condition which was diagnosed 
from his birth and had undergone an ECG a year earlier.

West London Coroner’s Court heard that
 another ECG after his admission at Hillingdon would probably have 
revealed the new problem in his heart.

Christine Mann, the hospital's matron and nursing services manager, apologised to Dylan's parents, saying one reason they were excluded was because of staff shortages

But it was not performed and by the 
time doctors realised his condition was critical – four days after his 
admission – he was suffering heart failure.

By the Saturday, the day before he 
died, his heart was racing and his eyes were puffy, which can be a 
symptom of an underlying heart problem. But he was still playing in his 
cot and showed no signs of heart failure.

Dr Barakat said: ‘The following day 
[Sunday] when I came in to see him, he looked very unwell. His liver was
 enlarged and his heart rate was very high. It was then I realised 
something needed to be done urgently.’  

Dr Barakat tried to arrange for Dylan 
to be taken to a hospital ‘set up for intensive care’ but the toddler 
went into cardiac arrest while he was on the phone and was put on a 
ventilator to help him breathe.

Dylan suffered two more cardiac arrests and Dr Barakat said the decision was taken to stop his ventilator.

Dr Sridharan, of Great Ormond Street 
Hospital in Central London, said an ECG would have helped but insisted 
there was no reason for staff at Hillingdon to have ordered one, based 
on Dylan’s symptoms. He said: ‘It doesn’t matter if it was the weekend 
or not, from the evidence, there was no need for an echo.

‘That for a cardiologist is a very 
frightening thing because if I had to do the diagnosis again, given the 
information we had, I wouldn’t have done anything differently.’

A post-mortem examination showed the 
toddler’s heart was enlarged and his lungs had a viral infection that 
contributed to his death but did not cause it. The cause of death was 
given as heart disease. The coroner recorded a verdict of death from 
natural causes.

Dylan’s parents Kirk, 35, and Tara, 31, from Uxbridge, made no comment after the hearing.

The Hillingdon Hospitals NHS Trust 
offered its condolences to Dylan’s family and said it hoped they would 
be reassured by the inquest’s findings.

He wasn't given an ECG as they are 'not normally done at the weekend'

Experts say there was no clinical evidence that he needed an ECG

However, if one had been carried out, it could have flagged up the disease

The coroner said he died from natural causes, there were no failings in Dylan's care and he was treated ‘appropriately’
