Ninety-one people including doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals have been charged with committing $430million in Medicare fraud in seven U.S. cities, Attorney General Eric Holder said on Thursday.

An investigation coordinated by the U.S. Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services uprooted alleged false billing schemes involving $230million in home health services, over $100million in mental health services, and $49million from ambulance transportation.

Charges range from healthcare fraud and conspiracy to wire fraud, kickback violations, identity theft and money laundering. The number and cost of the alleged fraud makes it the largest bust of its kind, Mr Holder said.

Mr Holder 
said in a news conference today that the case reveals an alarming trend 
of criminal attempts to steal billions of taxpayer dollars for personal profit .

The frequency with which Medicare fraud happens – and its scope – is alarming. The strike force team charged 107 doctors, nurses, and other licenced medical care professionals in May 2012 for schemes totalling more than $452million in false billing.

There was another takedown by the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) in 2011, involving 115 defendants in nine cities. They were charged with more than $240million in false billings, according to reports.

The government has taken significant steps to prevent such fraud. For instance, the Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act has required several new requirements –such as teaching senior citizens to identify and report fraud, as well as putting in place fraud detection systems. 

The FBI names Medicare fraud between three and 10 per cent of all health care billings, according to independent website The Medicare Newsgroup. It is estimated by the organisation that fraud costs between $16billion-$55billion, part of the $590billion Medicare system.

'Today’s enforcement 
actions reveal an alarming and unacceptable trend of individuals 
attempting to exploit federal health care programs to steal billions in 
taxpayer dollars for personal gain,' he said.

Assistant Attorney Lanny A. Breuer agreed, adding: ‘Today’s coordinated actions represent one of the largest Medicare
fraud takedowns in Department of Justice history.’

He continued : ‘We have made it one of the Department’s missions to hold 
accountable those who abuse the Medicare program for personal profit.

Medicare
Fraud Strike Force operations targeted health care workers in seven 
cities – Brooklyn, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los
Angeles, and Miami.

According to Mr Holder, one doctor alone was writing 33,000 prescriptions for some 2,000 patients between 2006 and 2011. Dr Joseph Megwa, who practices in Dallas, allegedly signed off these documents without reviewing them, causing $103.3million in false billings.

According to the Dallas Morning News, the 58-year-old’s alleged defrauding was the costliest. The doctor, who works at Raphem Medical Practice in Arlington, was indicted on conspiracy and health-fraud.

The Justice Department alleges that he helped patients in their homes while he was instead travelling abroad.

Bilked: Doctors, nurses and other medical professionals in seven different cities allegedly bilked $430million out of Medicare, the largest fraud of its kind

Two nurses, Ferguson Ikhile, and Ebolose Eghobor, were indicted along with the doctor. The three remain in federal custody.

Similarly, dermatologist Dr Robert Kolbusz of Chicago was charged with falsely diagnosing his patients and billing Medicare for treatments that were not given, the Chicago Tribune reported.

Seven individuals in Houston were 
charged for giving kickbacks of cigarettes, coupons, and food to 
Medicare recipients who would in turn just watch TV or play games 
instead of receiving the services that were billed to Medicare.

It allegedly led to $158million in fraudulent billing.

The announcement marks the latest case in a concerted crackdown against Medicare fraud by an inter-agency Medicare fraud strike force.

In Miami alone, 33 suspects were arrested and charged with fraud of more than $200million, according to NBC Miami, though little else is known about those charged in the city.

Mr
Breuer said that owners and 
operators at one Miami psychiatric hospital gave cash kickbacks to 
owners of assisted living facilities in order to obtain more patients.

They then billed the social insurance
plan more than $67million, often for services that were never offered, 
or patients they never actually had. 

Mr Breuer added that these 33 medical
professionals then billed Medicare for the cash they used as kickbacks 
for their false patients. 

Mr
Holder condemned the fraud as one that ‘siphons precious taxpayer 
resources, drives up heath care costs, and jeopardizes the strength 
of the Medicare program.’

He added: ‘They also victimise the most vulnerable members of society, including elderly, disabled, and impoverished Americans.’

The
strike force was created under the healthcare reform law as a means of 
curbing waste, fraud and abuse within the $590billion Medicare program 
that provides healthcare benefits to nearly 50million elderly and 
disabled beneficiaries.

In 
February of 2011, 111 medical practitioners were charged in a 
$225million Medicare fraud, which was then the largest of its kind.
