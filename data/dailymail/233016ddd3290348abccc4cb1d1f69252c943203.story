A pregnant Craigslist prostitute was stabbed 18 times, including four times in the head, and had her jaw broken in three places before she died, an autopsy revealed.

Jaymie Adams was found on January 7 and her husband Justin was later charged with two counts of first-degree murder for his wife and unborn child.

The autopsy report, released on Tuesday after an eight-month delay, declared the 25-year-old's death a homicide.

She was found by bikers wearing only a winter coat on the banks of Lake Stanley Draper, Oklahoma after disappearing last December. Â

Grisly: Jaymie Adams, 25, was killed after being stabbed 18 times and had her body dumped by an Oklahoma lake. Her husband Justin (left) has been charged with his pregnant wife's murder

Justin Adams, 25, was charged with murder on February 13 before being released from jail on $100,000 bail.

According to documents obtained by NewsOk, prosecutors asked for more time to prepare for the father-of-three's preliminary hearing. A court date has not yet been scheduled.

Irven Box, lawyer for Adams, said he believed police were looking at another suspect.

Police said the 25-year-old admitted lying about 
circumstances surrounding his wife Jaymie's disappearance which he reported on December 9.

He 
initially told them she was meeting a friend, then said his wife worked 
as an Internet prostitute and left to meet a client.

Officers said Justin Adams didn't reveal that his wife had accused him of domestic violence.

Mr Box said at the time of his client's arrest that he didn't see anything in the affidavit that tied his client to the killing.

Investigation: The body of Jaymie Adams was found on a dirt bike track weeks after she was reported missing by her husband

Mother-of-three Mrs Adams reportedly advertised her sexual services on Craigslist and had gone to meet a 
client the night she disappeared, her husband told police.

A motorcyclist found her body along a
 dirt track on January 7, although authorities believe it had been there for around 24 hours before being discovered.

The
 cars of Justin Adams and his mother Tina Clark were later seized by police looking for evidence.

He
 admitted he and his wife, who had been married since last February, were 
'swingers' and that she advertised on Craigslist as a 'massage 
therapist'.

Adam's arrest came after authorities gathered evidence from interviews, phone records, the internet and email accounts that were inconsistent with Adams' story.

Oklahoma law states a suspect can be charged with two murders
 if the victim is pregnant.

Suspicious: Jaymie Adams, 25, told her husband of one year she was going to meet a 'friend' at this McDonalds, where police later found her van

Following Mrs Adams' disappearance, her husband made an emotional TV appeal, urging the public to help bring his wife home safely.

He said: 'She deserves to be at home with her family, our children need their mother.

'My wife is a loving, strong woman. She's an amazing mom, and amazing wife. We have three sons and she's two-months pregnant this week.

'I'm begging that if anyone has any information about my wife or her whereabouts, call police.'
