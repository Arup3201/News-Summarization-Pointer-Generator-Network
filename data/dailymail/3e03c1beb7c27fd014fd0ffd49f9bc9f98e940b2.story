Suspected IRA terrorists will today be warned that controversial letters giving them immunity from criminal prosecution are no longer valid.

Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers is due to announce that assurances in so-called ‘comfort letters’ sent to those suspected of offences before the Good Friday Agreement of 1988 are being withdrawn

Some 200 suspects had previously been told they were unlikely to face prosecution unless new evidence against them came to light.

John Downey, who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the IRA’s Hyde Park bombing in 1982, walked free from court after the existence of a so-called 'comfort letter' emerged this year

Downey was accused of involvement in 1982 bombing, which killed four soldiers and seven horses

But it is understood that new letters are being sent out explaining that police will now mount a prosecution if it is felt there is enough evidence to do so.

In July, a review into how an IRA bomb suspect was wrongly told he was not wanted by police discovered two other cases where similar errors were apparently made.

Lady Justice Hallett found systematic flaws in the way ‘comfort letters’ were sent to almost 200 republican suspected terrorists who were on-the-run.

Critics claimed they amounted to a ‘get out of jail free card’ for John Downey, who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the IRA’s Hyde Park bombing in 1982.

David Cameron ordered the review of the scheme after Downey’s trial collapsed after it emerged he had received a letter clearing him to travel to the UK.

In May last year Mr Downey was arrested at Gatwick Airport and charged with killing Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young.

Seven horses were also killed in the attack as the soldiers travelled from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. But the existence of the letter telling him he was not wanted by police meant he walked free from court.

The Downey case triggered a political crisis at Stormont earlier this year. Many politicians, particularly unionists, reacted furiously, claiming they knew nothing about the letters.

Now the Historical Enquiries branch of the Police Service of Northern Ireland will conduct a review of all the cases as part of the process of issuing of the letters.

The letters had been introduced to deal with on-the-run suspects who had not been imprisoned for terrorist offences and released as part of the Good Friday Agreement.

But the secret process only came to light earlier this year when it was revealed the suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downey had been sent one of the letters.

A review by senior judge Lady Justice Hallett found systematic flaws in the way ‘comfort letters’ were sent out

The 62-year-old from Donegal was arrested at Gatwick airport in May last year, charged with murdering four British soldiers in the 1982 bombing. But the case was thrown out in February because he had received one of the letters by mistake.

Mrs Villiers will appear before the Commons Northern Ireland Committee today and it is understood she will explain that the original letters never meant the suspects would be exempt from prosecution.

A government source told the Telegraph: ‘What the Government is determined to do is make sure that nobody in receipt of one of the original letters should be in any doubt that they cannot rely on those letters to protect them from prosecution should new evidence emerge or a reassessment of existing evidence leads the PSNI and prosecuting authorities to a different conclusion from their original one.’
