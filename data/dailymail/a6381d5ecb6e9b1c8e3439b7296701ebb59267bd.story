The families of two Australian drug smugglers  today made the torturous journey to Indonesia's notorious 'Death Island' to say their final goodbyes before the pair are executed by firing squad.

Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were convicted of being ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the  island's airport for trying to smuggle 8kg of heroin to Australia.

They have been on death row since 2005 and have now been transferred to Nusakambangan island where they are expected to be executed this week. 

Chan's mother Helen and brother Michael were today pictured at Yogyakarta airport as they made their way to the island via boat from Cilacap in central Java.

They were accompanied by Sukumaran's mother Raji and sister Brintha, although it is not known whether they will be allowed to see the men as hoped tomorrow when visits are usually banned.

Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja tried to visit Chan and Sukuraman on the island of Nusakambangan

Close friend Matius Arif Mirdjaja - who Chan considers family - told Daily Mail Australia that prison officers would not allow him to see the Australians when he went to Nusakambangan today.

Earlier, a 'chilling' picture emerged of an Indonesian police chief posing with a smile on his face next to Chan on the flight to the island.

In the photograph, Djoko Hariutomo, the police chief of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, grins as he stands with his hand on the shoulder of the convicted drug smuggler.

In another picture, Hariutomo is seen with his hand on the shoulder of another condemned Australian, Myuran Sukumaran, on the same flight who gazed up at him as the camera flashed. 

Amnesty’s UK Director Kate Allen described the images as disturbing.

She told MailOnline: 'The pictures of guards smiling while escorting their prisoners to Indonesia’s so-called "Execution Island" are chilling.'

The planned executions of Sukumaran, 33, and Chan, 31, have caused diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Australia to fray.

The pair are among a group of up to 11 convicts, mostly foreigners, due to be executed on the prison island of Nusakambangan.

Chan and Sukumaran were convicted in 2005 as the ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were arrested at the holiday island's main airport for trying to smuggle 8kg (18lb) of heroin to Australia.

The seven other members of the gang, all Australians, have been jailed in Indonesia.

On Thursday, Indonesia rejected an Australian proposal for a prisoner swap made in an 11th hour effort to save the lives of Sukumaran and Chan.

Indonesia's foreign ministry said there was no legal basis for Indonesia to act on the proposal that had been made by Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

'Basically Indonesia does not have any regulation or legal framework regarding a prisoner swap,' said Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir. 

'This idea was put forward to our minister two days ago and we told them then.'

Australian politicians held a candlelight dawn vigil outside parliament house in support of the men early on Thursday, when Bishop said she had spoken to Indonesia's foreign minister earlier this week.

'I raised the fact that there were Indonesian prisoners in Australian jails and whether there was an opportunity for us to consider a prisoner swap, a prisoner transfer or a clemency plea in exchange for a return of prisoners,' Bishop said.

'I just asked for a pause in their preparations for the execution of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan so that we could have officials explore these ideas,' she told Sky News Australia.

Australia does not have the death penalty and a recent survey by the Sydney-based Lowy Institute think tank showed nearly two-thirds of the public disapproved of the executions.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had asked to speak again with Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Thursday. 

This is the spot to which the Indonesians took five foreign drug smugglers this year, tied them to three metre poles and executed them each with 12-member firing squads at around 12.40am local time  on Sunday, January 18

It is not known how the prisoners will be transported to Nirbaya valley, as it lies down a narrow dirt track (above) amid dense vegetation in the middle of Nusakambangan Island off southern central Java

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Widodo said the men would be executed soon, but not this week.

'I am still convinced that the justice system in Indonesia, if you look at drug crime, is valid and based on facts and evidence,' he said. 'That's why when I rejected their clemency, I looked at their cases, how many drugs they were carrying.'

Indonesia is expected to decide on the date for the executions in a few days, said Tony Spontana, spokesman for the attorney general's office.

Widodo has adopted a tough stance against drug traffickers and others on death row, denying clemency appeals. 

Executions resumed in 2013 after a five-year gap and nationals from Brazil, Malawi, the Netherlands, Nigeria and Vietnam have been among those put in front of a firing squad.

Meanwhile, an old school friend has revealed Andrew Chan never thought his impending execution would actually happen.

The friend, who has known Chan since they met in Year 7 at Homebush Boys High in Sydney's west, told 9News the Bali Nine ringleader was calm when they spoke through text messaging application, Whatsapp.

'Even he thought it was never going to happen because he thought we're in the limelight - it'll cool down, it'll be alright,' Sami said.

'So I always said, 'yeah mate, definitely - you're in good hands'.'

At least once during their exchange, Chan texted him 'all good bro'.

Sami added Chan kept positive throughout the ordeal and said: 'I think he [Chan] was really expecting the Australian government to do a lot more.'

The spot where the executions are due to take place is called Nirbaya, and it's located in a high spot amid the dense vegetation which runs along the spine of Nusakambangan.

Situated quite high up amid hills in the island's centre, Nirbaya was also the place where the Bali bombers, Amrozi, Ali Gufron and Imam Samudra were executed in 2008, six years after they carried out the nightclub bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians and 27 Britons.

Sami and Chan had been exchanging text messages on Whatsapp (pictured) up until Tuesday night

At the top of the hills surrounding Nirbaya, it is reportedly quite windy but offers a view of the Indian Ocean to the south.

The lead up to execution in 'Death Valley' has been well documented. Under the implementation of death penalty procedures set in Indonesia's criminal act of 1964, the condemned prisoner is informed in their isolation cell at least 72 hours prior to the execution that it will be carried out.

They are reportedly allowed three 'last requests' but these may only be in the form of final statements, such as that from Ms Andriani who wrote, 'Submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'.

Dressed in simple, white clothing, they are accompanied by a physician, clergy and an 'execution attorney' and taken to the clearing where a firing squad of 12 shooters is assembled for each prisoner.

Utter despair is etched on the face of condemned prisoner, Myuran Sukumaran, as he arrived at Cilacap airport in central Java, Indonesia, only 700km by plane but a world away from the comparative freedom of his art workshops inside Kerobokan prison on the island of Bali

This is the exterior of Batu prison on Nuskambangan island where special isolation cells away from non death row prisoners were prepared to hold Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran ahead of their scheduled execution by firing squad

In the case of Nirbaya, the journey will be up a steep winding dirt track through trees and undergrowth. At a clearing, three metre high execution poles have been erected at separate spots for each prisoner.

When the prisoners arrive and the firing squad is ready, the condemned person is asked whether they choose to be blindfolded and whether they want to be standing, sitting or kneeling for their execution.

A black cross is marked over their heart and they are given three minutes to 'calm down' before the execution takes place.

Although a clergyman of the prisoner's choice is meant to be allowed to take their last rites, Brazilian Marco Archer was reportedly denied access to Cilacap's Catholic priest Charles Burrows and was so stressed in his last hours he said that he wanted to die sooner, but eventually had to be dragged bodily from his cell for transport to Nirbaya.
