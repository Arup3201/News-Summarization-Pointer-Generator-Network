Queen Elizabeth I may be one of the most recognisable figures in British history but her style has changed over the centuries.

A hidden detail has been discovered underneath one of the most iconic portraits of the Tudor monarch.

An X-ray has revealed the queen was originally painted wearing an elaborate wing-like veil, but this once fashionable feature was painted over in the eighteenth century to make her look more modern.

Beyond the veil: X-rays reveal that Queen Elizabeth I was originally painted wearing an elaborate wing-like veil, but this fashionable feature was painted over in the eighteenth century to make her look more modern. This line shows where the veil was on the original portrait and traces of lace can be seen

This detail and others were discovered when paintings of Tudor monarchs were X-rayed ahead of an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery.

The original portrait of Elizabeth I showed her wearing large ‘wings’ around her head, as was fashionable at the time.

This was almost completely overpainted in the 18th century when wings were no longer in vogue, to create the ‘prettified’ image we see today.

Getting under her skin: An x-ray (pictured) revealed hidden details that were over-painted. Tree-ring dating has shown that the wooden panel of the portrait was made from a tree that was felled after 1604, just after Elizabeth’s death

Elizabeth I was the daughter of Henry VIII and the last Tudor monarch

She was born in Greenwich on 7 September 1533.

Elizabeth I ascended the throne in 1553 and reigned for 45 years.

Her reign is considered to be a golden age of English history when arts and science thrived.

Elizabeth’s first priority was to re-establish Protestantism but it was not enforced harshly.

Under her reign, England expanded its trade overseas and in 1580 Sir Francis Drake became the first Englishman to successfully circumnavigate the earth.

The arts flourished in England during this period as Shakespeare, Spenser and Marlowe created poetry and drama.

A popular monarch and brilliant orator, Elizabeth easily united England against Spain when Philip II of Spain launched a great fleet of ships, known as the Spanish Armada, to try and overthrow her. The fleet was defeated.

She famously said: ‘I know I have the body of a weak, feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king - and of a King of England too.’

Elizabeth insisted she was married to her country and didn't marry or provide an heir. She became known as the virgin queen.

She was fashion conscious, with over 3,000 dresses in her collection and died of lead poisoning on 24 March 1603 as a result of the powder she used on her face.

Tree-ring dating has shown that the wooden panel of the portrait was made from a tree that was felled after 1604, just after Elizabeth’s death.

The gallery's chief curator Dr Tarnya Cooper said: ‘Elizabethan portraits were rarely appreciated as art objects in later centuries, but Elizabeth's reputation as a Protestant champion meant that there was still demand for her image. As a result, artists often reworked original portraits into images that adhered to contemporary notions of beauty.’

While undertaking technical analysis of the Gallery’s portrait of the young Edward VI conservators discovered not another painting but a real animal.

Art experts found a beetle trapped where it died when the work of art was varnished hundreds of years ago.

This varnish has now been removed as part of the conservation treatment and the portrait can be seen afresh showing details, not easily identifiable previously, such as the boy king’s pale eyes and individual hairs, and the delicate pinks of his collar and flesh tones.

Other works going on show include a plaster and wood bust of King Henry VII, which was originally part of a life-size effigy of the king made for his funeral procession, and six portraits of King Henry VIII.

Dr Cooper said the show was the result of seven years of work, adding: ‘Visitors will encounter multiple lifetime portraits of each monarch, providing a fascinating and vivid impression of one of the most dynamic dynasties in history.’

The Real Tudors: Kings And Queens Rediscovered opens at the National Portrait Gallery in central London today.
