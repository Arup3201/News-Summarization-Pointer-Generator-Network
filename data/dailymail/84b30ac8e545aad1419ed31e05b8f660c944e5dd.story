Scientists working with NASA's 230-foot-wide (70-meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone in California have revealed radar images of a near earth asteroid as is approached us just days ago.

Near-Earth asteroid 2007 PA8 passed by on Oct. 28, 29 and 30.

The asteroid's distance from Earth on Oct. 28 was 6.5 million miles (10 million kilometers), and 5.6 million miles (9 million kilometers) on Oct. 30, and it made its closest approach on November 5th, coming within 17 times the Earth-moon distance (4 million miles or 6.5 million kilometers).

This composite image of asteroid 2007 PA8 was obtained using data taken by NASA's 230-foot-wide (70-meter) Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, Calif.

JPL scientists chose to image asteroid
2007 PA8 due to its size and relative proximity to Earth at the point 
of closest approach.

The perspective in the images is similar to seeing the asteroid from above its north pole.

Each of the three images is shown at the same scale, Nasa said.

'The radar images of asteroid 2007 PA8 indicate that it is an elongated, irregularly shaped object approximately one mile (1.6 kilometers) wide, with ridges and perhaps craters.

'The data also indicate that 2007 PA8 rotates very slowly, roughly once every three to four days.'

The trajectory of asteroid 2007 PA8 is well understood.

This flyby was the closest Earth approach by this asteroid for at least the next 200 years.

Although the orbit of 2007 PA8 is well known and is not considered a threat to Earth in the near-term, it is classified as a 'near-Earth asteroid.'

The images were taken as part of Nasa's spaceguard project to watch for steroids and other objects that could hit earth

The Goldstone observations are a part of NASA's Near-Earth Object Observations Program, or 'Spaceguard,' where objects are discovered, characterized and tracked.

Spaceguard identifies potential threats to our planet.
