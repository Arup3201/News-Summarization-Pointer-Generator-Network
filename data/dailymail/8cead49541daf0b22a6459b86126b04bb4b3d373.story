A 13-year-old boy was sent home on his first day of school because of an 'offensive' haircut.

Kyle McGeever made it two hours into the academic year at John Henry Newman Catholic College in Birmingham before he was told to leave.

He was one of three pupils who were punished for breaching the rules with a new style yesterday.

Kyle McGeever, 13, from Birmingham, has been sent home from school because his hair was too short

Furious mother Rebecca Cartwright blasted the school for overreacting.

Ms Cartwright, 33, said: 'I was told I needed to pick Kyle up as his haircut wasn’t respectable, was offensive, and didn’t comply with school policy.

'I don’t see how they can deny him his education. It’s taking it too far.'

It is the second time the teenager has been in trouble over his hair. Last year he was forced to study alone for a week when he modelled himself on Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ms Cartwright added: 'While sitting in the foyer waiting to speak to the head, I saw kids in Kyle’s year who had shorter hair and the Cristiano Ronaldo V-cut hairstyle.

'That was the haircut Kyle had last year when they put him in isolation for a week. They need to have one rule for all the kids.'

But head teacher Jennifer McGuirk rebuffed the family's claims.

Ms McGuirk said: 'It was the first day of school and, if students didn’t have the correct uniform, we gave them the chance to go home and correct it.'

'Other students were sent home. As far as I’m aware, of the three pupils who had extreme haircuts, Kyle was the only one not to return to school with it blended in.

'It wasn’t an exclusion - any student coming in without the correct uniform, in trainers or denim for example, would be sent home to get changed.

'School standards are really high and our students work hard to keep them. I felt sorry for Kyle as he told me the barber had taken too much off.

'We don’t want children to think it’s OK to come to school without the proper uniform.

'We don’t condone extreme haircuts at the school and so will not have a child in the usual classes.'
