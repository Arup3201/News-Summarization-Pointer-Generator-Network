When Margot and Valerie were rescued from a battery farm things started to look up.

No longer stuck in cramped cages, they were suddenly free to roam around the garden to their hearts’ content.

But it seems their new-found freedom wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. The chickens weren’t used to being outside and found it a bit chilly for their liking.

Nice and warm: Ex-battery chickens Margot, left and Valerie, right, show off their cosy fleece-lined jackets

Wrapping up: The pair had jackets made after their owners were told ex-battery hens often struggle in the cold

So their owners, Trevor and Samantha 
Stickley, put their heads together and came up with a solution – two 
chicken-sized fleeces.

The couple from Bournemouth took the pair to a tailor’s shop where the birds had their inside drumsticks and chicken breasts measured for two fleece jackets.

The garments slip over the hens’ heads and cover their crowns, although there is enough room for them to flap their wings.

One of the jackets is lined with leopard print and has a wishbone design on the front andthe other has a red trim and a heart logo on.

The 18-month-old Rhode Island Red hens will wear the coats throughout the winter until they are more used to the chilly temperatures.

Trevor, 47, a taxi driver from 
Bournemouth, said: 'We rescued the chickens from a battery hen place and
this is their first winter out of the environment they’re used to.

Good fit: The chicken's breasts and inner drumsticks were measured by staff

'Battery hens don’t see day light and they aren’t used to the cold weather or changes.

'Someone explained to us that they might suffer from the cold in their first season, so we looked on the internet for a way around this.

'We took Margot and Valerie to a local tailors and they have fitted them with these two lovely jackets.

Creation: The jackets, pictured completed above, were then made from a drawn pattern, pictured behind

'Our family and friends think that it’s brilliant we managed to find somewhere who would happily measure and fit coats for two chickens.'A spokeswoman from the Zip Yard, the tailors behind the quirky jackets, said: 'We were very surprised to have an enquiry about a pair of chickens.

'We have never worked with animals before and it was the weirdest request we have received but we were happy to help.

'They were our most bizarre customers but they very well behaved.
