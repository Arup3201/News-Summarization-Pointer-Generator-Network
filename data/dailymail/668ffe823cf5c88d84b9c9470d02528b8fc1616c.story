An eyewitness who saw the killing of Michael Brown at the hands of officer Darren Wilson has revealed his version of events leading up to the fatal shooting.

The man, whose name has been withheld, from St. Louis, Missouri, says that the teenager did not have his hands above his head when Wilson shot at him, but rather 'out to his sides.'

He also said Brown 'staggered toward Wilson despite commands to stop' and that 'the two were about 20 to 25 feet apart when the last shots were fired.'

Eyewitness account: A man who saw the shooting of Michael Brown (above) says that the teen had his 'hands to the side' and was approaching a police officer when he was shot

Excessive force: Despite the fact that Brown was approaching officer Darren Wilson (above) and did not have his hands fully raised, the witness calls the shooting 'outright murder'

The man, who is African American, also testified to this account in front of the grand jury considering whether or not to indict Wilson on murder charges.

And while he would not detail exactly what he told the grand jury when speaking with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, he did say the that the 'members seemed fair and asked a lot of questions.' 

Another critical piece the man shared was that the officer did not fire until Brown turned back toward him.

He says that Brown and his friend were walking down the middle of the street when Wilson pulled up to them and they exchanged some words, which he could not hear.

Wilson then pulled up in front of the boys and then backed up his car, when a 'tussle' occurred on the passenger side which the witness could not see.

Then a shot was fired - he does not say whether or not is was intentional - and he saw Brown run down the street, followed by Wilson, who was yelling at the 18-year-old to 'Stop!' 

The young man Brown was with, Dorian Johnson, ran the other way according to the witness. 

Then, after being told to stop a few more times, Brown turned around and took a step towards Wilson. 

Slogan: Some have claimed Brown said to the officer, 'Hands up don't shoot,' which has led many protestors to use that as their chant (above)

Coming out: There have been numerous rallies in the St. Louis area since the August 9 shooting

'When he stepped foot on that street, the officer told him to stop again, and he fired three shots,' said the witness.

'When he got hit, he staggered like, "Oh," and his body moved. Then he looked down.'

He added, 'His hands were up like this (he gestures with arms out to the side and palms upward), and he was looking at the officer and was coming toward him trying to keep his feet and stand up. The officer took a few steps back and yelled, "Stop," again, and Michael was trying to stay on his feet.'

At this point he says Brown was 20 to 25 feet away and staggering. 

'As he was firing those last rounds, Michael was on his way down. We were thinking, "Oh my God, oh my God, brother, stop, stop." He was already on his way down when he fired those last shots.'

The witness also said Wilson didn’t have to kill Brown. 

'It went from zero to 100 like that, in the blink of an eye. ... What transpired to us, in my eyesight, was murder. Down outright murder.' 

People claiming to have witnessed the August 9 shooting of Brown have given wildly different accounts of what happened, with some saying the young man had his arms raised over his head and that Wilson shot him while his back was turned and he was running, and the police saying the unarmed teen physically assaulted the officer and tried to get his gun.
