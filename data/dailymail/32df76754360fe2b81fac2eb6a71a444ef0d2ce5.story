Novak Djokovic narrowly missed facing a British player as his opponent in the Australian Open first round.

On Monday the world No 1 will face qualifier Aljaz Bedene, the 25-year-old Slovenian who is hoping to receive British citizenship and switch allegiance.

Bedene, based in Hertfordshire since 2008, defeated Poland’s Michal Przysiezny in the final qualifying round, backing up his impressive run to the final of the ATP event in Chennai last week.

It further underlined his credentials as a player to watch and he is likely to return to the top 100 in the near future. 

He is currently awaiting approval from the Home Office for his passport but will have to appeal against International Tennis Federation rules if he is to represent GB in the Davis Cup.
