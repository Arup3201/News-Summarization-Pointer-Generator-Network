With its ghostly pallid fur, near-transparent skin and razor-sharp teeth, the ghost bat is one animal that's difficult to imagine snuggling up to.

Otherwise known as the 'false vampire bat', the Australian native is under threat from the man-made loss of habitats, prompting a bid by preservationists to save the vulnerable animal before it's too late.

Last month, Taronga Zoo was celebrating after it's new breeding program for the vulnerable animal led to the first successful birth of a ghost bat pup in 15 years.

The pup is the first to come from the Zoo's newest breeding pair Celeste and Nocturne, and an encouraging sign for the regional breeding program. 

Ghost Bats, Australia's only carnivorous bat, are endangered by the loss of feeding habitats and the destruction of caves and mine shafts. 

'They are particularly vulnerable to mining, which can threaten their maternity caves,' said Wendy Gleen, a Taronga zookeeper.

Once spread extensively throughout the country, scientists have found the animal is now dispersed into small pockets of population, which gravely raises the threat of extinction.

The birth of the animal provides a great opportunity for visitors to see the elusive creature up close. 'Ghost Bats are difficult to spot in the wild, as they often live in complete darkness and hide in remote caves,' Ms Gleen said. 

'They've got the most amazing facial structures and use echolocation to find their way in the dark. Our modern sonar systems could probably learn a thing or two from these bats' natural talents.' 

The pup is already on display at the Zoo's Australian Nightlife exhibition, though it remains to be named, since keepers have not yet determined its gender.

'The pup has been clinging to its mother for warmth and security, clutching onto her neck with its back legs,' said Ms Gleen.

Sharp-eyed visitors may be able to spot the pup at the very end of the walkthrough at Taronga's Australian Nightlife exhibit.
