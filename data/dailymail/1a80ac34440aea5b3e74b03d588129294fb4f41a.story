Operation: Baroness Thatcher is 'absolutely fine' following the surgery, a spokeswoman said

Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was kept in hospital last night as she recovers from a minor operation.

Friends said it was likely that the ex-Tory party leader would spend Christmas there after surgeons removed a growth from her bladder.

Baroness Thatcher, 87, was admitted to the Central London hospital on Thursday after complaining of feeling unwell.

Last night, Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted her ‘a speedy recovery’.

And sources close to her said she was doing well and ‘in very good spirits’. One source said: ‘When someone is of Lady Thatcher’s age, there’s always concern after an operation, but she is fine.’

PR guru Tim Bell, who was one of her closest advisers, said: ‘The operation was a success and her condition is satisfactory.’

Lady Thatcher has suffered from increasingly frail health, including a minor stroke, in recent years.

She is rarely seen in public because her memory is failing. But she remains interested in Tory politics and is a regular presence at parties thrown by Liam Fox, the former defence secretary.

Advertising guru Lord Bell, who was Lady Thatcher’s chief election campaign adviser, said she had had a procedure to remove the lump.

He added: ‘Following an examination in hospital on Wednesday Mrs Thatcher had a minimal invasive operation to remove a growth in her bladder.

‘The operation was completely satisfactory. She will stay in hospital to recuperate for a few days and then she will return home. Her daughter Carol was with her in hospital. She’s very tough.

‘The doctors are perfectly happy. They say the operation has been completely satisfactory.’

Lady Thatcher was the first female prime minister of Great Britain and one of the few national leaders to win three successive terms of office.

She spent 11 years in Downing Street, the longest run by any 20th century prime minister.

In 1990, a leadership challenge forced her to leave No 10 and two years later she was made a life peer, as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven.

In recent years she has led a quiet 
life cared for by her loyal housekeeper Kate. She suffered a minor 
stroke in 2002 which left her with short-term memory loss. Her beloved 
husband Denis died in 2003 and her children Mark and Carol both live 
abroad.

Her health was thrust into the global
spotlight this year with the release of a Hollywood film about her with
Meryl Streep in the lead role.

The Iron Lady drew criticism from 
David Cameron and others for concentrating on the dementia she has 
suffered. Miss Streep won an Oscar for the role.

Lady Thatcher was not well enough to 
join the Queen for a lunch with former and serving prime ministers as 
part of the Diamond Jubilee this summer. And two years ago she missed an
85th birthday party thrown in her honour by Mr Cameron at 10 Downing 
Street.

In October she was sufficiently well,
however, to mark her 87th birthday with lunch at a restaurant in 
London’s  St James’s district with Mark and his wife.
