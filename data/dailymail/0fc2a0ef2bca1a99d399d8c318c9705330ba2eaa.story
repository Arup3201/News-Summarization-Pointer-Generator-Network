Nearly two years after his Rutgers University roommate Tyler Clementi committed suicide, Dharun Ravi apologized for using a webcam to spy on Clementi's intimate encounter with another man.

Ravi called his actions 'thoughtless, immature and stupid,' but maintained he didn't target Clementi because he was gay and said he didn't act out of bigotry or hatred of gays.

This was the first time the 24-year-old has apologized for his role in the September 2010 case that drew national attention to the bullying of gay teens.

Mea culpa: For the first time in nearly two years, Dharun Ravi, seen here at his sentencing earlier this month, has issued an apology for spying on his Rutgers University roommate

Ravi was convicted in March of bias intimidation, invasion of privacy and tampering with evidence after a highly-publicized trial. A judge sentenced him to 30 days in jail.

In the written statement, released through his lawyer, Ravi said he would turn himself in Thursday to begin serving his sentence.

'I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010 and September 21, 2010,' he wrote.

'My behavior and actions, which at no time were motivated by hate, bigotry, prejudice or desire to hurt, humiliate or embarrass anyone, were nonetheless the wrong choices and decisions. I apologize to everyone affected by those choices.'

Too lenient? Prosecutors are appealing the 30-day sentence Judge Glenn Berman handed down and arguing Ravi should have to serve five to seven years in prison

Last Monday, I was sentenced to 3 years probation, 300 hours of community service, a fine of more than $10,000.00, and 30 days in jail.

Since the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office appealed that sentence, the sentence does not have to start until the appeal is decided.

Nevertheless, I decided to accep and hopefully complete the sentence as soon as possible. It’s the only way I can go on with my life.

I accept responsibility for and regret my thoughtless, insensitive, immature, stupid and childish choices that I made on September 19, 2010 and September 21, 2010.

My behavior and actions, which at no time were motivated by hate, bigotry, prejudice or desire to hurt, humiliate or embarrass anyone, were nonetheless the wrong choices and decisions. I apologize to everyone affected by those choices.

I am surrendering myself to the Middlesex County Correctional Facility on Thursday, May 31, 2012, to start my 30-day period of imprisonment.

Ravi maintains he is innocent of committing any crime.

Prosecutors are appealing the sentence, 
saying Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Glenn Berman was far too 
lenient when he gave Ravi just a month in jail.

They say Ravi should have been sentenced to the standard five to seven years -- more than 85 times longer than his current term.

With good behavior, Ravi could be out in as few as 20 days, the Newark Star-Ledger reports.

The mea culpa added that Ravi didn't have to start his sentence until after the prosecution's appeal, but he wanted to get the jail time over with.

'It's the only way I can go on with my life,' he wrote in his statement.

On September 19, 2010, Clementi, 18, asked Ravi, his new college roommate, if he could have their dorm room to himself. Ravi left, but set up a webcam and watched Clementi's romantic encounter with another man.

Two days later, when Clementi asked for the use of the dorm room again, Ravi set up the webcam a second time and advertised on Twitter that he planned to broadcast the encounter to other students in his dorm.

Police say that when Clementi learned the next day that his intimate moments have been recorded, he set his Facebook status to 'Jumping off the gw bridge sorry.'

His body was recovered in the Hudson River a week later near the George Washington Bridge.

Clementi's suicide was mentioned only a few times during Ravi's trial because prosecutors couldn't make the case that the spying led to Clementi's decision to kill himself.
