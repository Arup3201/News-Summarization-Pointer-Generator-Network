A police riot van 'catapulted' over a car this afternoon after ploughing into the vehicle in a scene described as 'like something out of Die Hard'.

The police vehicle collided with a blue hatchback and was left on its side in Jamaica Road, Bermondsey, southeast London.

The front bonnet of the car was completely caved in.

The van was driving at high speeds to respond to an urgent call but police cannot confirm what call that was

Three people, including a police officer, were taken to hospital by paramedics after the crash

The van is thought to have been racing down the busy road with its lights and siren blaring before crashing into the car, rolling over and skidding around 100ft.

Three ambulances attended the scene and gave assistance to five people who escaped with only minor injuries.

A witness to the accident, who asked not to be named, said: 'I saw the van rolling over - it was like something out of Die Hard. I felt sick.

'It had blue lights on but I don’t know about the siren. I’m just glad it looks like no one was seriously hurt.'

A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: 'At 1.03pm police were alerted that a police van had been involved in a collision with a car, leaving the police van on its side.'

Five people were hurt in the crash, four members of the public and one police officer but all injuries were minor

Traffic officers will now investigate what caused the crash on the busy southeast London road

The police initially said six people were hurt in the crash but later corrected this to five.

A spokesman for the force confirmed that two members of the public and one police officer were taken to hospital with minor injuries and a further two members of the public were treated by paramedics at the scene.

Fernando Grace posted pictures of the aftermath on Twitter and wrote: 'Big accident just happened between a speeding police van and a car at Jamaica Rd, SE16. The police van catapulted over the car!'

Melissa Tran, a receptionist at the nearby Hair Candy salon, said she was one of the first on the scene after the crash.

The accident occurred shortly after 1pm and has caused traffic disruption throughout the afternoon

Witnesses described the crash as 'like something out of Die Hard' but, luckily, no one was seriously injured

The 43-year-old said: 'I heard a loud noise and was the first to run out because it is two footsteps from here.

'I think it was a female driver and she looked like she was in her late 20s and her companion was a gent in his 50s.

'She was very shaken and so was her passenger but there was no blood and they didn’t seem to be seriously hurt.'

A police spokesman said the van was responding to an urgent call but said enquiries are still ongoing into what exactly it was responding to.

An investigation will now be conducted into the incident by traffic officers but the spokesman said it is too early to speculate on the cause of the crash or to give an estimate on how long the probe into the incident might take.

A man with abdomen pain and a woman with back and abdomen pain were taken to the Royal London Hospital by paramedics and a man with a minor head injury was taken to King's College Hospital.

One witness to the crash said they felt 'sick' seeing the accident unfold before them on the busy street

Police can not yet confirm how long the investigation by traffic officers into what caused the crash will take
