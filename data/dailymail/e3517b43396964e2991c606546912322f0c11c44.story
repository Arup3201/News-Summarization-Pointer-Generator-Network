The son of a kayaker who died alongside his brother and cousin almost drowned in the same river two years ago, it was revealed today.

Anthony, the son of Darren Thorpe, had been climbing by the River Tyne with his friends aged 12 when he slipped and plunged 25ft into the water below, banging his head on his way down.

Knocked unconscious when he landed on a metal buoy in March 2012, Anthony was pulled to safety by his friends - but he was left with a fractured hip and pelvis and had six staples in his head.

Today, the three men from the same family found dead when their kayaking trip on the swollen Tyne went disastrously wrong were named.

Brothers Darren Thorpe, 41, and Mark 
Thorpe, 39, of South Shields, South Tyneside, and their cousin Gavin 
Bradley, 36, from Jarrow, South Tyneside, ended up in the river and 
drowned.

The men had last 
been seen at a spot called Devil’s Water on Sunday night and were using 
‘sit on’ style kayaks, of a kind commonly used by leisure trippers 
rather than serious kayakers.

They died in conditions dangerous enough for the local canoe club to cancel a planned excursion.

A
 neighbour of Darren Thorpe, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘It's 
awful. His son Anthony nearly lost his life in the Tyne a couple of 
years ago and now his dad has lost his life in the Tyne.

‘When
 Anthony got stuck on the river his friends had to help him out. We were
 all worried. They have had no luck - his wife Louise has just lost her 
job as a teaching assistant too.

‘I
 think Darren thought about taking Anthony sometime with the kayak but I
 think Louise put her foot down. If Darren was still here he might have 
gone out with his dad and his brother.’

The

cried myself when I found out and when I told my daughter she had a few 
tears and then my son.'

Torrential
 rain over the weekend had made the Tyne near Hexham, in Northumberland,
 faster, deeper and more dangerous than normal.

'They would have gone down to a gorge, where the  water is very fast flowing,  and that would have been extremely dangerous'

Witness

Emergency
 services were scrambled when the men did not return home to South 
Tyneside on Sunday evening and three bodies were found hours later after
 a search involving coastguards, police, firemen and an RAF helicopter.

Police are investigating but there are no known witnesses and the truth of exactly what happened may never emerge.

The
 trio, who have not been named, had parked a car at Hexham, where they 
started the river trip, and were planning to paddle 14 miles downstream 
to reach a second car at Wylam.

They
 got about half way when tragedy struck. They are believed to have been 
last seen at around noon on Sunday at a location near Corbridge known as
 Devil’s Water, a tributary of the river.

The
 dog walker who saw the three men said they were wearing helmets and 
life jackets, but was surprised to see them because kayakers are rare at
 this time of year in that stretch of water.

He
 said: ‘They were heading downstream. I didn’t notice anything wrong and
 couldn’t hear what they were saying to each other. They would have gone
 down to a gorge, where the water is very fast flowing,  and that would
 have been extremely dangerous.’

'We have two families completely distraught. It’s unimaginable'

Chief Superintendent Gordon Milward, Northumbria Police

The
 men had been expected home by 7pm and the partner of one of them rang 
police at 11pm. A search began and the first body was spotted at 5.10am.

Two
 of the bodies were found near a weir and water treatment works at 
Riding Mill and the third about a mile upstream in the Corbridge area. 
Three kayaks have also been recovered.

Chief Superintendent Gordon Milward of Northumbria Police said: ‘We have two families completely distraught. It’s unimaginable.’

The
 men had been on the river at least once before, he said, adding: ‘The 
river was high, fast and deep. It would be testing, I would suggest, for
 anybody to do anything on the river.

Planning: Emergency services were joined by the RAF and the Coastguard as they searched the river

Sea King: Emergency services received a call at 11pm yesterday saying the trio had failed to return home

Discoveries: Just after 5.10am, a body was recovered from the river, and a second was found at about 6.20am

Working: Landing in a nearby field, rescue teams studied maps of the scene as they carried out the search

Location: The two bodies were recovered in the River Tyne near Riding Mill, west of Newcastle-upon-Tyne

‘We don’t yet know the standard of their kayaking and what their physical capability was.’

Police
 have no idea whether all three kayaks were thrown into the water as a 
result of the conditions or if one or two of the men went in to rescue 
another and drowned in the process.

'We will miss him. I am devastated, I cried myself when I found out and when I told my daughter she had a few tears and then my son'

Neighbour of Darren Thorpe

A
 member of a local canoe club said: ‘The kayaks they had are known as 
“sit on top” kayaks and are generally associated with leisure kayakers. 
Experienced kayakers wouldn’t use them.’

A member of staff at a local shop selling kayaks said the area of water where the bodies were found was ‘treacherous’.

He
 said: ‘It would not be recommended to go on the river in boats like 
this, especially given the water level. You would need to be incredibly 
experienced, even then it is not advisable.’

The
 tragedy is the second in just over three years on the same stretch of 
the Tyne. Amateur canoeist Andrew Weatherill, 33, from Hartlepool, died 
after becoming trapped in the weir at Riding Mill in 2011.

Last night Northumbrian Water confirmed that there were warning signs in the area.
