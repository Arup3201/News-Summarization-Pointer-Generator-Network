He's having a baby with the most photographed woman in the world, whose life is played out on the small screen.

But it seems that Kanye West cannot handle the glare of girlfriend Kim Kardashian's spotlight, admitting that he won't be returning to her TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians because of the 'backlash' his last appearance generated.

Although he accepts the reality show is a big part of Kim's life, the 36-year-old, who described himself in the New York Times as the 'Steve Jobs of popular culture', has vowed to protect his unborn daughter and her mother.

He told the US newspaper: 'This is my baby. This isn't America's baby.'

His emphatic statement of protective intent came as the star faced allegations on Wednesday that he cheated on Kim with Canadian model Leyla Ghobadi.

Couldn't handle it: Kanye West has admitted that he won't be returning to Keeping Up With The Kardashians as he had 'an issue with the backlash' after his last appearance

The rapper spoke about his brief appearance on the E! show, where he was seen giving Kim advice on her wardrobe.

'You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore,' he said, admitting that he didn't' like the attention.

'And it's not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get.

'Because I just see like, an amazing person that I'm in love with and want to help,' he added.

Protective: Kanye has said that he wants to protect Kim and the baby, and would 'do anything'

Not public property: Kanye, who hosted a listening party for his new album, Yeezus, on Monday said that the couple's baby belonged to them and not to America

When asked if he had any thoughts on parenthood, Kanye admitted that he felt it was his duty to protect his girls, especially as they will be under the spotlight.

'One of the things was to be protective, that I would do anything to protect my child or my child's mother. As simple as that,' he said.

Clearly worried that his daughter will face just as much scrutiny as her mother, the Watch The Throne star admitted that he didn't want his baby to become public property.

'Well, I just don't want to talk to America about my family,' he said. 'Like, this is my baby. This isn't America's baby.'

Kanye also used the New York Times interview as an opportunity to inform his fans that he only apologised after interrupting Taylor Swift's acceptance speech during the MTV Video Music Awards in 2009 because of 'peer pressure'.

Backlash: Kanye has said that he was criticised when he tried to help Kim arrange her wardrobe on the show 

He explained: 'I think that I have like,
faltered, you know, as a human. My message isn’t perfectly defined. I 
have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure.'

Meanwhile Kanye 
has been accused of cheating on his pregnant other half with glamour model Leyla.

'This
is going to destroy the Kardashian family. It’s bad. It’s really bad. 
It’s just embarrassing. But if I were Kim and about to have a baby, I 
would want to know,' she told Star magazine.

Kanye
is said to have first set his sights on curvy model Leyla when he saw 
her dancing in the crowd at his show in Atlantic City in July last year.

Allegations: Canadian model Leyla Ghobadi has claimed that she had a sexual relationship with Kanye while he was with Kim

Lifestyle disparity: Kim lives her life in the public eye and on screen, while Kanye wants their family life to be private

And while Leyla admits she knew Kanye
was with Kim at the time, she said the 36-year-old musician told her 
the relationship was 'for publicity and nothing serious'.

Kim's representatives have said the report is 'not true' while Kanye's spokesman has yet to respond to MailOnline's request for comment.
