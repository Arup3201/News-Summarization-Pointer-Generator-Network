Digging a hole: Gert-Rudolph Flick and his wife Corinne drew up the plans for an underground extension at their £30m London home

A multi-millionaire German-born industrialist has seen off opposition from neighbours to win approval for a lavish two-storey underground extension at his £30 million London home.

Daimler-Benz heir Gert-Rudolph 'Muck' Flick, 68, and his third wife, sweet heiress Corinne, 46, drew up the plans, which include a 50 ft swimming pool, a steam room, and two separate store rooms for their winter and summer clothes.

Planning chiefs gave the proposals, which also feature a cinema, a beauty and treatment room and a gym, the go ahead despite an outcry from neighbours - led by cellist Julian Lloyd Webber.

Development of the Georgian property, near Onslow Square in South Kensington, west London, will involve a 30ft hole being dug and partial demolition of the house.

The proposals were approved last night by Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council's planning committee, which had been sent letters by 55 residents opposed to the plans.

The area is also home to Queen Noor of Jordan, jeweller John Asprey and JCB chairman Sir Anthony Bamford.

Opponents raised concern about the noise and disruption, with building work expected to last three years, and have vowed to continue their fight.

Mr Lloyd Webber, who has lived in the district his whole life and is president of the Onslow Square neighbourhood association, told the Evening Standard: 'There will be massive disruption and havoc in the whole area for goodness knows how long.

'The council should protect its residents but if it can grant permission for this, one of the oldest houses in that area of London, it seems nothing is sacred.'

Another neighbour, George Barbour, 
labelled the plans 'tasteless' and 'environmentally hazardous', and 
added: 'I'm appalled by the council's decision - but not surprised, as 
it's always riding roughshod over residents' views.'

Planning
officers concluded that the development would be 'visually discreet' 
and would 'preserve the character and appearance' of the Thurloe and 
Smith's Conservation Area.

They added that the conditions 
imposed by councillors would 'adequately control and mitigate the 
impacts of the construction process'.

Mr
Flick bought the property into 1986. It has seven bedrooms and six 
bathrooms as well as a 55 ft gallery, known as the Red Room, which has 
housed his impressive art collection, including A View Of Fireworks Over
Venice by Canaletto.

The 
house was originally two properties, one of which was owned by Grand Met
founder Sir Maxwell Joseph, and the other by Lady Annabel Goldsmith.

Mr Lloyd Webber is the younger brother of musical composer Andrew and has been dubbed the doyen of British cellists.
