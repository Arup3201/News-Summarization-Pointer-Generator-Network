The Duchess of Cambridge was the first commoner to marry the heir to the throne in 350 years and is descended from coal miners, a road sweeper and even a prisoner.

But new research into her family has revealed that the middle class princess has noble blood after all.

A previously unknown branch of the Middleton's family tree shows Kate can count earls, countesses and even a Prime Minister among her ancestors.

The Duchess welcomed the news about her ancestors when she was informed during the first 
weeks of her pregnancy.

Pupils in Melbourne, Australia, stumbled across the link during a genealogy project set by their teacher Michael Reed.

The children were asked to research either the family tree of the Duchess, David Beckham or rapper 50 Cent using an online programme.

It was soon discovered that the 
Duchess was related to William Petty FitzMaurice, the 1st Marquess of 
Lansdowne, whose ancestral seat Bowood House in Wiltshire is considered 
one of Britain's best stately homes.

He
 served as Prime Minister between July 1782 and April 1783 during the 
reign of George III and is remembered for negotiating the peace 
settlement that ended the American War of Independence.

Mr Reed said he embarked upon some 
serious research when he realised while helping his pupils that there 
was a connection between the Middletons and the Lupton family - a rich 
and successful merchant and manufacturing family.

Kate was the second cousin 
three times removed of Barbara Lupton, who became Lady Bullock when she 
married Sir Christopher Bullock.

Sir
 Christopher, a descendent of William Petty FitzMaurice, worked as 
principal private secretary to Winston Churchill and later became 
permanent under-secretary at the British Air Ministry.

Mr Reed told The Sunday Times: 'Everyone has always made it clear Kate's a commoner so when I saw one of her cousins had a title I was surprised and intrigued.'

The teacher contacted Edward, the surviving son of Sir Christopher and Lady Bullock who confirmed the connection.

He also sent his findings to the Duchess, who thanked him for the research.

Her assistant private secretary Rebecca Deacon wrote back on October 19, in the early stages of Kate's pregnancy, that the Duchess sent her best wishes and thanks to the teacher.

Mr Reed told The Sunday Times: 'It is a good feeling to know that I've unearthed something that may be of interest to the Duchess, her family and the Royal family.'

He traced the Duchess's family line back five generations to the Marquess of Lansdowne and his brother Thomas FitzMaurice who lived at the Buckinghamshire stately home Cliveden with his wife Mary, 4th Countess of Orkney in the late 18th century.Â 

William Bortrick, the chairman of Burke's Peerage, said it will make an 'interesting inclusion' in the next edition of the guide, which will be published after the Duchess gives birth.
