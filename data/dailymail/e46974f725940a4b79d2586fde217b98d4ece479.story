Honey Boo Boo's mother, June Shannon, attempted to give her first daughter, Anna 'Chickadee', away for adoption after becoming a parent at 15, it was claimed today.

The 33-year-old reality star from McIntyre, Georgia, now a mother-of-four, first asked relatives if they would take the baby while pregnant, sister-in-law Janice Shannon has apparently said.

June is said to have then 'abandoned' Anna, then seven, at the home of her mother, Sandra Hale, in order to 'move into a trailer with a boyfriend'.

According to the National Enquirer, Janice, who was married to June's late brother, Jimmy, had been prepared to take Anna, but June did not want to lose her parental rights so the adoption failed to take place.

The magazine says that child welfare officers eventually gave custody of Anna to Sandra, and it was only this year that the teen moved 
back in with her mother.

But
the current arrangement is just for the cameras, it claims.

A source told the title: 'Anna
lived with Sandra until earlier this year, when June bribed her with 
$500 a month to move back in with the family and be on the TV show.

'They thought that Anna's illegitimate teenage pregnancy would make for good story lines for the show.'

Anna is now a teenage mother herself, to two-month-old Kaitlyn, who was born with an extra thumb on one hand.

She is no longer in a relationship with the baby's father, Caleb Clark, 19, who she dated for two years.

Caleb says he is now fighting to gain
access to Kaitlyn and told the tabloid that he wants to get the child 
'out of that house and away from that family', but is unable to take 
action because Anna apparently refuses to let him take a paternity test.

He
told the Enquirer: 'Anna was in her grandmother's custody, but she was 
still desperate to get away from June officially. June was a lousy 
mother to Anna.'

He insisted that the happy cohesive family that appears on television is a far cry from reality.

'You
can see it,' he continued. 'Anna still resents June and stands apart 
from the rest of the family. When the cameras are turned off, Anna 
doesn't have much to do with any of them.'

Caleb told the tabloid that he had every intention of marrying Anna until she admitted that she had cheated on him.

Anna,
who does not have a relationship with her own father, ex-con David 
Dunn, supposedly sent Caleb an email when she discovered she was 
pregnant.

It apparently 
read: 'I kinda had sex with someone the week before we did, but I 
trusted him to wear a condom, but I don't think he did, and that's what 
scares me.'
