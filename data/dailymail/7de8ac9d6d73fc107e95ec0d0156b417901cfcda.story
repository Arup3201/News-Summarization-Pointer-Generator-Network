Prosecution: Gillian Astbury, 66, died at Stafford Hospital after staff failed to give her insulin and the Trust has now admitted breaking the law

A scandal-plagued hospital trust has today admitted breaching health and safety law after a  a patient died when nurses failed to notice she was severely diabetic and needed insulin.

The Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust has pleaded guilty to failing to ensure the safety of Gillian Astbury, yet no staff will face the consequences in the courts.

The 66-year-old lapsed into a fatal diabetic coma while being treated at Stafford Hospital in April 2007.

The NHS trust was prosecuted as an
organisation, meaning that individual nurses, doctors and managers will
not face jail for their failings.

Today it has pleaded guilty through its barrister to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act by failing to properly manage and organise hospital services, including its systems for record-keeping, patient information and communication between staff members.

Hundreds
of patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire 
between 2005 and 2009, and earlier this year a damning report warned 
that many others had suffered inhumane abuse.

Gillian
Astbury was admitted to Stafford Hospital following a fall at home.

She was put under the care of a
team of nurses who did not bother to read her medical notes and failed 
to realise she was diabetic and needed regular doses of insulin.

She 
fell into a coma and died ten days after first being admitted on to the 
ward.

Her friend and carer, 
Ron Street, said that when he went to visit her she was often in soiled 
bed linen and her meals would be left out of reach.

Deaths: Up to 1,200 people died needlessly at Stafford Hospital - the worst scandal in NHS history

The
HSE began investigating the death in April, having postponed its probe 
until after the publication in February of a major report following a 
public inquiry into the scandal.

Families of the Stafford Hospital victims and union chiefs called for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to resign

It concluded that there was 
enough evidence to charge the trust under the Health and Safety at Work 
Act, for failing to protect others against risks to health and safety.

The criminal prosecution at Stafford Magistrates' Court was brought by the Health and Safety Executive three years after an inquest jury ruled that Mrs Astbury's death was contributed to by low staffing levels and a systemic failure to provide adequate nursing facilities.

The trust could now be fined tens of thousands of pounds.

The
HSE said it was not the first time a hospital trust had been prosecuted
under the law but there have been only a handful of cases.

Although
the proceedings were not being brought against individuals, two of the 
nurses involved face being struck off following professional hearings.

In July the Nursing and Midwifery Council ruled that Jeanette Coulson and
Ann King had failed to keep Mrs Astbury’s records up to date or carry 
out blood tests. The panel will decide on a punishment for the two 
nurses over the coming weeks.

Maggie
Oldham, chief executive at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, 
said: ‘We accept the findings of the Health and Safety Executive’s 
investigation. Our thoughts remain with the family of Gillian Astbury 
and we apologise for the appalling care Ms Astbury received at our 
hospital in April 2007.’
