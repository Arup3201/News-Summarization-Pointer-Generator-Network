A deaf five-year-old girl due to undergo surgery in a hospital reduced to rubble by the Oklahoma tornado has finally had the operation after a nurse dug her hearing implant out of the debris.

Jayde Scholl, a Chinese orphan adopted by an American doctor last year, was due to have a cochlear hearing device implanted in her ear last week.

But the implant, which costs between $25,000 and $30,000, was lost when the Moore Medical Center was destroyed during the storm which wrecked 20,000 homes and killed 24 people last Monday. 

Jayde's operation was then postponed indefinitely while doctors considered the logistics of finding a replacement implant. 

Happy ending: Jayde Scholl, aged five, can be seen smiling as doctors test out her cochlear implant after a nurse found the missing device among the rubble of a hospital destroyed in the Oklahoma tornado

Before the storm: Jayde had been due to undergone the surgery at the Moore Medical Centre in Oklahoma

Tragedy: The Moore Medical Center was left as just a shell of the building after a tornado hit the area in Oklahoma last Monday

Speaking after the storm, Jayde's adoptive mother Jaque Scholl told kjrh: 'Well, her device is somewhere between Dallas and Kansas. I have no idea. I don't know what happens when a tornado takes the device away.'

When nurse Sherry Raper heard about Jayde's predicament, she spent hours digging through the rubble until she found the computer-sized box holding Jayde's implant.

Mrs Scholl said: 'The staff wanted something good to happen this week. They wanted Jaydeâ€™s journey to keep moving forward. An amazing community of folks have helped make this happen in the midst of so much tragedy.'

Jayde underwent a successful surgery at the Norman Healthplex on Friday morning - meaning the five-year-old can finally hear in both her ears. 

Search: Nurse Sherry Raper spent several hours searching through the rubble of the Moore Medical Center in the aftermath of the tornado to find the cochlear implant

Success: After the cochlear implant was retrieved, Jayde Scholl was able to undergo an operation to have it placed in one of her ears

Jayde Scholl, who was unable to speak, hear or use sign language last year, can now hear in both ears after she had one cochlear implant in February and her second on Friday

The schoolgirl had previously undergone the cochlear implant surgery to correct the hearing in her other ear in February. A cochlear implant is an external device that receives the sound through a microphone, computer processes the sound and delivers the information to an internal device placed under the skin.

But at one time, it was thought Jayde would never be able to hear.

Jayde was placed in a Chinese orphanage after she was found abandoned by her birth mother in a town square when she was just eight-months-old.

She had no access to medical treatment to help improve her hearing until she was adopted by Jaque Scholl, a doctor of audiology at the speech and hearing clinic Scholl Center, and her family last year.

The family then concentrated on helping Jadye, who was unable to speak, hear or use sign language, to be able to hear for the first time by organising for the five-year-old to have cochlear implants in both ears. 

Giving hope: Jayde's adoptive mother, doctor Jaque Scholl, said staff at the Moore Medical Center, pictured after the storm, wanted some good to happen in the aftermath of the tornado

The cochlear implant was in a storage cupboard at the Moore Medical Center, pictured, in Oklahoma when the storm hit. Nurse Sherry Raper remembered where it had been stored and set out to find it
