Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo has predicted Barcelona's first XI for the coming La Liga season, including new signings Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Jeremy Mathieu.

However, there is no room for recent signing from Arsenal Thomas Vermaelen.

The daily newspaper describes the team as a 'brutal eleven', and says the team could be devastating after their reinforcements, especially with the 'formidable' front three of Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar.

New signing: But there is no place for former Arsenal skipper Thomas Vermaelen

The former Gunners skipper joined the Catalan giants in a £15m deal last week.

Vermaelen was left frustrated last season under Arsene Wenger due to lack of game time, and could face similar problems with new boss Luis Enrique.

Barca's new squad looks formidable as ever, with Suarez joining Messi and Neymar in a mind-blowing forward line, though the Uruguayan will of course not be available for selection until late October.

One position not yet clarified at the Nou Camp is that of the right-back, with Dani Alves' future at the club not yet clear.

Sought-after: Negotiations continue over Fiorentina and Colombia's Juan Cuadrado (left)

Colombia World Cup star Juan Cuadrado is a target for the position despite his attacking preference, with Fiorentina seemingly willing to part with the 26-year-old.

Manchester United are also rumoured to be in for Cuadrado, though the draw of Barca should they come in for you has already been highlighted this summer.

Just ask Claudio Bravo, Suarez, Rakitic, Mathieu, and ter Stegen.
