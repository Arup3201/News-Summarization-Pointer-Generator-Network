Eric Joyce has denied being an alcoholic following his second arrest in the House of Commons

A bar room brawl in the House of Commons that led to Labour MP Eric Joyce being arrested was sparked when his assistant called a 24-year-old researcher 'babe', it was claimed today.

Politics graduate Louise Thomas, who works for Tory MP Adam Afriyie, alleges Joyce's assistant Martin Brown made a sexist remark to her during the incident on Thursday evening in a parliamentary bar.

She told The Sunday Times: 'I don't know Eric Joyce or his assistant. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was upsetting but I wasn't hurt.'

Thomas said she saw a heated exchange between Brown and another researcher Alex Cruz Vidal, who she knew, and tried to intervene by telling them to calm down.

Brown is said to have responded: 'Don't talk to me like that, babe.'

Thomas says Cruz Vidal tried to retrain Brown and then the police were called, The Sunday Times reported.

Thomas told the paper she did not want to take the matter further, while Brown could not be reached for comment.

Meanwhile, former Army Major Joyce, photographed being restrained by police on the ground, insisted he was not drunk when the brawl happened and he had not thrown any punches.

In his first interview since Thursday night's incident, Joyce, 52, said he had had two glasses of wine, adding: 'There was no question of me being p****d.'

But he freely admitted he struggled to control his temper. 'I'm quite aggressive when poked and I was poked,' he said.

Joyce was arrested on suspicion of assault after he allegedly wrestled two officers to the ground and held one in a headlock at Westminster's Sports and Social Club bar. He was held in a London police station and released on Friday.

He claimed the incident occurred when police wrongly accused him of starting a separate fracas at the  same bar.

Joyce says the only injury was to a policeman who sustained a 'twisted finger' when he 'fell underneath' the MP.

'I was having a disagreement on the 
door verbally. As I was talking to him, the police ran up and arrested 
me… aggressively.' He denied hitting anyone and said police arrested him
'just for being difficult'.

'I was tested extensively when I got 
to the police station and the nurse said “he is completely sober and 
able to give evidence to the police”.'

The MP says he was presented to a 
senior Commons official 'by the police, like a trussed-up chicken, like 
he was some guy I should be paying obeisance to.'

And he is furious at a Commons drinks ban which means he cannot be served with alcohol at Parliament.

He said Commons chiefs had 'confirmed to everyone that I had been p****d, which is disgraceful'.

Police said the MP, who was initially arrested on suspicion of assault, was further arrested while in custody on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm

Arrest: The 52-year-old former soldier was arrested last February over a
brawl at the nearby Strangers bar in Parliament where he headbutted 
Tory MP Stuart Andrew

'There's no evidence to it. It 
confirms the whole drunk, alcoholism, all that stuff and the Commons 
authorities go “Yeah, fine, we'll just act according to rumour and 
innuendo”.'

Following a similar incident last 
year, Joyce was thrown out of the Labour Party and agreed to give up his
seat in Falkirk, Scotland, at the next Election.

Asked why he got involved in fights so
often and whether it was plausible that it was 'always someone else's 
fault,' he shrugged: 'Yeah, you're right. Me walking into a fracas is a 
bit of an ironic unlikely tale.'

He said Thursday night's fracas was 
'nothing to do with the business of me going out looking out for a 
fight, pushing my way through crowds, getting p****d, that kind of 
stuff. My reaction to being challenged aggressively is different to 
other peoples and that's a bad thing.'

Put to him that if he did not sort out
his troubles, he could end up in jail and with a longer sentence than 
ex-Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne's eight months, Joyce reflected: 'I'll have to
think  about that.'  

A House of Commons spokesman decline to comment.
