Rory McIlroy is the latest sporting superstar to try his hand at the 'Mobot' after bumping into middle-distance king Mo Farah.

The pair met at Nike World HQ in Oregon, United States - the home of the duo's sport manufacturer, with McIlroy uploading a picture with Farah to his Facebook page on Wednesday.

Accompanied with the caption: 'Look who I met at Nike World HQ earlier this week!!' McIlroy can be seen imitating Farah's famous celebration in what he may dub the 'Robot.'

Golfing star McIlroy has enjoyed a stellar 12 months in the sport including ending the year as world No 1

The 25-year-old won two majors, including his first Open title (pictured) at the Royal Liverpool Golf Course

The Mobot has become synonymous with Farah's performances on the athletics track and was performed after the British star won Olympic gold in the 5,000 and 10,000m on home soil at the London 2012 Games.

And while McIlroy's Robot may not be seen at the 18th of any putting greens soon, the celebration would be an apt one for the 25-year-old who has enjoyed a stellar 2014.

The Northern Irishman has produced the best golf of his career in the past 12 months as he added to his two majors with his first Open and second US PGA Championship this summer before playing an integral role in Europe's successful Ryder Cup campaign.

To top it all off the world No 1 won the Race to Dubai to cap a memorable year.

If the Holywood-born star can repeat his success into 2015, who knows if the Robot may become a customary sight alongside's McIlroy's trophy-laden form.
