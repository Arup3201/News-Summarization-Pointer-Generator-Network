Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos scored the only goal of the game in Vigo on Tuesday night as the reigning world champions beat the team whose crown they won in Brazil this summer.

'We can't pretend that 2014 has been a good year' said Vicente del Bosque after Spain ended the year in defeat. 'We want to look forward with optimism but we cannot be happy with the way we played at the World Cup.'

It was fitting that Spain lost their last game of the year to the team that replaced them as World Champions; although it seemed for most of the match that neither side would break the deadlock.

Spain started with just four of the players that helped them win the World Cup four years ago and Germany fielded only three of their starters from the victory over Argentina in the Maracana in July.

The host's first real chance came on 11 minutes when Celta Vigo forward Nolito almost scored on his debut in his home stadium. He let-fly from distance only for former Northampton Town keeper Ron-Robert Zieler to turn the shot around the post. The Hannover 96 goalkeeper had gone on loan at Northampton and played two games for the Cobblers in the 2008-09 season.

Spain were playing the better football with Isco pulling the strings against Real Madrid team-mates Kroos and Sami Khedira. With three Real Madrid midfielders on the pitch and the driving rain making for rapidly deteriorating playing conditions coach Carlo Ancelotti will have had a nervous eye on the match having lost Luka Modric for three months when he injured a tendon in his thigh against Italy at the weekend.

When the injury scare came it was for Germany manager Joachim Löw and for Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola as Thomas Müller was taken off after 23 minutes with a bruised back. His last contribution was to play a part in the best move of the first half.

It was the first glimpse of the kind of football that wins World Cups from Germany as Kroos, Muller and Mario Gotze combined brilliantly. Iker Casillas – playing his 160th game for Spain – got down well to make the save.

Del Bosque took off three of his World Cup winners at half time with Sergio Ramos, Sergio Busquets and Gerard Pique all replaced and then brought on Kiko Casilla in goal for the last 15 minutes. His brief debut turned sour as Kroos showed his class with two minutes left scoring from distance to give Germany the win.
