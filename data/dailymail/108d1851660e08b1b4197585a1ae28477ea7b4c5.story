Incredible CCTV footage has emerged showing a woman narrowly escaping death after Shakhtar Donetsk's stadium was damaged by shelling during the ongoing conflict in Ukraine on Monday.

Despite a ceasefire being agreed between the Ukraine government and pro-Russian Separatists the Donbass Arena suffered blast damage causing part of the glass facade to be shattered.

The video shows a woman approaching the stadium before she hits the ground after hearing a loud explosion.

Shakhtar are currently playing home games in Lviv  to escape the conflict-torn city of Donetsk and have moved their headquarters to the capital Kiev.

The Donbass Arena, which holds 52,000 people, was built for Euro 2012.
