A morbidly obese man dubbed ‘The Human Doughnut’ has lost 29 stone with the help of a low calorie diet and counselling.

Rob Gillett, 27, hit the headlines in March 2012 when he appeared on Channel 4’s ‘Supersize vs. Superskinny’ weighing 41st 10lbs.

At just 25 years old and 5ft 3ins, his BMI was an incredible 104 – the healthy range is between 18 and 25.

Doctors became increasingly concerned about his health and now, in just 17 months, he has turned his life around by losing 70 per cent of his body weight.

He has dropped to a healthy 12st 9lbs.

Mr Gillett, from Bridgend, said: ‘Taking the decision to lose weight wasn't easy as I knew I had to tackle my demons, and still can’t believe I have lost the same amount of weight as two grown men.

‘I have a new lease of life now. I ran a 10k race, do Nordic walking and have a personal trainer.’

Mr Gillett, whose waist measured 6ft 6ins, decided to take part in ‘Supersize vs. Superskinny’ as his first bid to lose weight.

He
 said: ‘I wanted to do Supersize as I thought that it could help me deal
 with my weight, however, I just felt humiliated at the media 
headlines.

‘The attention I got from the show 
was just horrendous at times too. Somebody sent me a big box of Krispy 
Kreme doughnuts and put jagged pieces of metal in them.

‘The police never caught the person who sent the box, but needless to say my family and myself were distraught.

‘I
 know that I was the person putting food into my mouth, but the reality 
is that food was not the issue - I was battling with underlying, 
deep-seated problems and I was using food to dull the pain.

Mr Gillett said: 'I know that I was the person putting food into my mouth, but the reality is that food was not the issue - I was battling with underlying, deep-seated problems and I was using food to dull the pain'

Mr Gillett's first attempt at weight loss saw him appear on Channel 4's 'Supersize vs. Superskinny' (pictured). He lost 4st but quickly regained the weight and says he was shocked by the negative attention he received

‘I felt the show really didn't help at all, and I ended up putting on the four stone I lost quickly after filming stopped.’

Mr Gillett started to pile on the pounds at the age of eight as a result of childhood abuse.

By the time he was in his early 20s, he was eating 7,000 calories a day and was addicted to fizzy drinks and cake.

Before his weight loss, Mr Gillett 
ate two slices of toast with poached eggs for breakfast, with a cup of 
tea and a glass of orange juice.

He would then have a breakfast baguette, a bag of crisps, biscuits, an apple and 500ml of coke for lunch.

For dinner he would eat a chicken curry with rice and chips washed down with 500ml of coke.

Mr Gillett has now lost weight by adopting a 
very low calorie diet and by attending LighterLife counselling sessions 
to help him understand the underlying psychological issues contributing 
to his overeating

Mr Gillett said: 'The attention I got from the show was just horrendous at times too. Somebody sent me a big box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts and put jagged pieces of metal in them'

He would also snack on cake and would drink another two cups of tea and 1.5l of coke each day.

He said: ‘I was a healthy, happy child up until the abuse started. It went on until I left school and included every type of abuse.

‘It was horrific and something that I am only just coming to terms with. I don't want to make excuses, but I know that my issues with food are directly linked to these events.

‘If I had not turned to food, I would probably have used drugs or alcohol.’

During his teenage years, Mr Gillett gained about 2st each year and at just 17 he suffered a mini-stroke.

He also had such bad sleep apnoea that even breathing apparatus could not always keep him breathing normally.

After 'Supersize vs. Superskinny' failed to help him lose weight, Mr Gillett joined LighterLife which saw him revolutionise his diet and regain his self-confidence meaning he shed the pounds rapidly

He said: ‘I know people will be shocked by how much weight I put on, but it was the only way I knew how to deal with my emotional issues.

‘I look back now, and can’t believe that I put my life in so much danger. The sleep apnoea was terrifying and the reality is I could have died at any time.’

At his heaviest, Mr Gillett was almost housebound and he was unable to drive because his stomach got in the way.

He had to get a taxi to take him to 
the bus stop and he had to be given a bucket when he was on a plane as 
he couldn’t use the bathroom.

Mr Gillett also lost nearly all of his teeth because his gums became so weak.

After failing to maintain his weight loss after taking part in ‘Supersize vs. Superskinny’, Mr Gillett joined LighterLife.

Mr Gillett says he hopes his weight loss will inspire other people to realise that they too can lose weight

Before his weight loss, Mr Gillett had severe sleep apnoea and he had suffered a mini-stroke. He was also housebound and had to take a taxi to his local bus stop

He
 said: ‘I knew I had to do something about my weight, and had seen 
people like Pauline Quirke lose weight on LighterLife and thought it 
could work for me.

‘I 
had tried so many diets in the past that I was sceptical it could work, 
but it was like a light bulb came on for me when I went to my first 
session.

‘For the 
first time I was on a weight loss programme that tackled the emotional 
issues of eating, and it allowed me to see why I was basically eating 
myself to death.’

The programme saw him adopt a very low calorie diet as well as having cognitive behavioural therapy and counselling.

The youth worker said: 'I was named "The Human Doughnut" because of my shape and size.

'My addiction was mostly for sweet stuff, like chocolate, biscuits and cakes - and I quite liked a pie, once in a while.

Mr Gillett (pictured at 18.5st during his weight loss) was dubbed 'The Human Doughnut' by the media because of his incredible size

'I didn't like what I see in the mirror but when I saw food I just want to eat it. And eat, eat, eat. But I am no longer that person. I feel brilliant.

'I'm down at the gym at 5am and I exercise five days a week. Its changed my life - I am raring to go.

'Sometimes
 people think I've had gastric surgery, but I'm so proud I've done it 
all myself. The challenges I've faced have made me stronger.'

Mr Gillett added: ‘The support I have received from the general public has been incredible too.

‘So many people have been staggered by how much weight I have lost.

‘It’s not uncommon for people to 
recognise me in Cardiff from “Supersize vs. Superskinny” and be shocked 
when they realise I have lost 29 stone.

Mr Gillett believes he turned to food for comfort as a result of being abused as a child - he says that if he had not started comfort eating, he would probably have becoming addicted to drink or drugs

‘The
 best thing about losing weight is that I can hopefully inspire others 
and make them realise that it’s possible to lose weight with the right 
support.’

Claire Warren, LighterLife counsellor for Bridgend said: ‘Rob has worked so hard to lose weight and he is a real inspiration.

‘We have worked together for more than 16 months and I have been so impressed with his commitment to the LighterLife programme.

‘He has seen this whole experience as a real opportunity for change, and has been a huge support to all the other men in his group sessions.

‘The best thing for me is seeing Rob turn into a confident and assertive young man, who is taking enjoyment in life.

‘Rob really is finally having the chance to live the teenage years that he missed out on and build a better, healthier future for himself.’
