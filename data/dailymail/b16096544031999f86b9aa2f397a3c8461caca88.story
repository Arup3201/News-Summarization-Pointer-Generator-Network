Seattle-based coffee giant Starbucks has offered up a flavorsome form of support to its home team, the Seahawks, as they prepare to take on the New England Patriots at Sunday's Super Bowl, by creating a limited edition green and blue Frappuccino in honor of the team's colors. 

Created by long-time Starbucks employee Thom Arvin, the Seahawks Frappuccino is a unique take on the company's much-loved Vanilla Bean Crème beverage, which blends blueberries and matcha green tea in order to achieve the team's traditional blue and green coloring.

'It’s definitely difficult to make something blue,' Mr Arvin said of his creation. 'I thought blueberry would be the best option to add to a Vanilla Bean Frappuccino and the matcha green tea adds a touch of green to the whipped cream.

Part of the team: On Friday, Starbucks employees in Washington and Oregon encouraged customers to sample the specially-blended beverage which was created by long-time employee Thom Arvin

'It took about six blends to make sure I had the right amount of blueberries.'

Mr Arvin added that he hoped some of the players from his favorite team would have a chance to try out the beverage, before heading into their tough Super Bowl showdown - particularly the team's quaterback Russell Wilson.

'I would love it if Russell Wilson would try a Seahawks Frappuccino,' he said. 

'We are both from Richmond, Virginia and his high school was Collegiate, which is where my whole family on my mother’s side went to school.'

And the specially-crafted Frappuccino is not the only way in which Starbucks is pledging its support to the home team, who beat the Green Bay Packers 28 to 22 in order to advance to the Super Bowl. 

The popular coffee chain has also rolled out a collection of limited edition Seattle Seahawks gift cards, bearing the number 12 - to signify that the fans will act as the 12th member of the team, alongside the 11 players who take to the field at a time. 

Starbucks employees working in Washington State were also encouraged to wear Seahawks colors to work today, in honor of the home team.

They were joined in their efforts by a Seattle Seahawks mascot who helped to give out samples of the limited edition Frappuccino to customers, as well as boosting their team spirit.
