These are the ultimate honeymoon keepsakes when photographs or nicked bathrobes just won't cut it.

In a bid to offer a personalised getaway and lasting memories, the super swanky Ladera Resort in Saint Lucia is allowing newlywed couples to purchase and customise the furniture in their luxury suites and ship it home at an additional cost.

For couples who have spare change after splurging on an extravagant wedding and exotic honeymoon, a four-poster bed - carved with the couple's names or initials - will set them back more than £3,000 (plus shipping).

It may sound unusual but the resort says there is a practical side to it as many newlywed couples move into new or larger homes and look to fill it with new or unique furniture.
