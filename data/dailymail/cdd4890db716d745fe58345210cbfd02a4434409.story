The full extent of the impact of good schools on house prices around England is laid bare by research released today.

A map produced by Savills estate agents shows the cost of homes near the best performing schools can be more than 25% higher than in other areas.

Each dot on the map represents a school, with the darker coloured dots representing better performing schools and the size of the dot showing the 'house price premium' around that school.

The fact that the darker dots are often the largest in each area shows just how much parents are willing to pay to live near a good school.

Savills say the map shows that certain areas can be classed as 'educational hotspots', in which a choice of good schools leads to a spike in property prices.

The company say the best examples of these are Northwood in Middlesex, Brighton in West Sussex, Shrewsbury in Shropshire and Ascot in Berkshire.

The map also shows how selective grammar schools, such those in Kent and Buckinghamshire, drive up house prices in the surrounding area.

Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills, said: 'What it shows is there are clear house price premiums around high performing state schools. These are not uniform, there are exceptions where people can still get access to a well-performing school, but generally, there is a premium.

'That said, I suppose there is a bit of a chicken and an egg situation of where you have to ask whether affluent families cluster around a high performing school, or are schools high performing because of the families who live nearby.'

The report states: 'For many [house buyers], rather than pinning their hope on a single school, a choice of good schools will determine whether they will look to buy.

'In locations such as Northwood, Brighton, Shrewsbury and Ascot that will be driven entirely by a cluster of high performing independent schools.

'In others such as Dorking, Malvern, Borehamwood, Warwick, Oxford and Guildford these will be supplemented by one or two high performing state school alternatives.

'In other areas, such as Wallington, Altrincham, Orpington it might be exclusively a function of the grammar school system.

'In others, such as Bath Winchester, York, Colchester, Tunbridge Wells, Chelmsford and Cambridge the a network of a range of high performing schools underpins a high value family housing market.'

The research comes after a study last year found a top state secondary adds an average of £21,000 to surrounding house prices - with one school in Buckinghamshire adding nearly £500,000 to the price of nearby homes.
