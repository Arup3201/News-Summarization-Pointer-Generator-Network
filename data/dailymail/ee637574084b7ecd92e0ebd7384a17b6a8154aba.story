A New York artist has made his feelings for Mark Zuckerberg  clear after painting a portrait of the Facebook founder using his own excrement.

Brooklyn-based artist KATSU used his own faeces to create a likeness of the Facebook CEO which has been put on display at a local art gallery, surrounded by blinking neon lights. 

This is not the first time KATSU has hit out at Zuckerberg using his art, and has often criticised the way Facebook uses personal data.

One way to make a statement: Brooklyn-based artist KATSU painted this portrait of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg using his own faeces

Two years ago the artist decorated New York City with posters showing the Facebook founder with a black eye and a chipped tooth.

'With the Internet being literally woven into the human experience, I cannot stand by and not voice my discontent with those who plan on owning our lives,' KATSU told Gizmodo at the time.

'I'm upset and confused. I want the ability for people to permanently remove their information from Facebook… 

'I want Facebook to adequately explain to all users the extent to which their data will be farmed out and shared.

Likeness? The portrait of Zuckerberg is exhibited at The Hole gallery in Manhattan

He added: 'Mark is Mark. He's this mutation, this gross aspiration everyone idolises. His face has reach. He deserves to be ridiculed.' 

The faecal matter portrait of Mark Zuckerberg is part of the Remember the Future exhibition at The Hole gallery in Manhattan.

Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook has yet to comment on the unusual portrait.
