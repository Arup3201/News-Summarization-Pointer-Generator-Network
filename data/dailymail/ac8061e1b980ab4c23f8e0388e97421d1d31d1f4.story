A three-foot cement replica of the Great Sphinx appeared in New York on Tuesday was the latest addition to Banksy’s street artist residency, until it was swiftly sold by a business owner before the day even ended.

While many of the works have been vandalized, Bernardo ‘Choco’ Veles sold the one near his Millets Point, Queens auto-glass shop Tuesday afternoon to an eager art collector for an undisclosed sum.

As men Veles hired began to haul the foam, cement and cinderblock sculpture away, a crowd there to take pictures booed and a fight very nearly broke out.

Street sculpture: British street artist Banksy's October 22 addition to his New York residency was this foam and cement sphinx in Willets Point, Queens, though it wasn't there long

Banksy fever took over New York as soon as the first bit of street art—a stencil of two boys stealing an actual anti-graffiti sign—hit the city as part of the artist’s Better Out Than In.

Veles is not the first to profit from the class crusader’s work.

When a painting of a beaver popped up on an East New York wall, some men threw a pizza box over it and started charging people $5 each to see and photograph it.

But he might be getting the richest from the found art.

Protected: The sculpture was, while it lasted, surrounded by a moat of stagnant puddle water

'No turn unstoned,' reads the caption on Banksy's website. 'A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashe cinderblocks. You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water'

‘A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,’ Veles told the New York Post.

Veles said a female collector was desperate for the work, but ‘I don’t want to say more,’ he said.

Just hours after it appeared, the statue was being pulled from the ankle-deep stagnant puddle it stood inside.

As a truck backed toward it, some people in the crowd yelled ‘all the way!’ in an apparent call for the sphinx to be destroyed rather than carted off.

Sold: Just hours after it was sighted, the sphinx was sold by the owner of a nearby auto-glass shop named Bernardo 'Choco' Veles for an unknown sum

Quick turnaround: Veles hired 20 guys to help him get the sphinx loaded into a truck

One of Veles’ workers even sold a brick out from under the sphinx for a hundred dollars.

‘You don’t own it,’ screamed Darwin Requena from the crowd.

‘Are you looking to start something,’ the worker said in Requena’s face.

'A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,' said Veles.

Veles said that an unidentified art collector desperately wanted the piece and she was swift in scooping it up. 'I don't want to say more,' he said.

‘I don’t want to fight,’ said Requena. ‘We just want to take pictures and you’re blocking it.’

Banksy's website has been documenting, and sometimes commenting on each of his one-per-day pieces.

For October 22, the site read, 'No turn unstoned. A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashed cinderblocks.You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water.'

On Saturday, Banksy painted a picture of a boy about to smash a water sprinkler with a hammer, titled 'Better Out Than In', on the Upper West Side. Saul Zabar, of the famed grocery store family, has helped add protective Plexiglass, to preserve the artist's work on his family's building on West 79th St

Graffiti reading, 'Let the streets decide' has already been sprayed over - and cleaned off - the painting

Banksy's Monday offering to the streets of New York is this picture of a young boy writing graffiti in the South Bronx, 153rd Street and Elton Avenue, while being served by a waiter in tails

And in Greenwich Village, two Banksy works, 'Sirens of the Lambs' and 'Shoe Shining Ronald McDonald' made a rare appearance together outside a McDonald's
