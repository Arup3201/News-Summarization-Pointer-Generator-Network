The U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division is paying $544,000 for a shiny new LinkedIn profile, in the wake of a partial government shutdown that followed a top Democrat's assurance that 'the cupboard is bare, there's no more cuts to make.'

While Congress was wrangling in December over how many billions to trim from future budgets, Washington bureaucrats were spending like teenagers with their first credit cards.

According to the 'Google for government' website FedBizOpps.gov, the federal government has issued more than 1,300 procurement contracts since the beginning of December, including six-figure outlays for valet parking, portable toilets, expensive lamps, and special boxes to ship fruit flies from one government facility to another.

The DOJ Criminal Division will soon have a new LinkedIn page complete with an easier way to attract job-seekers -- who could presumably find USAjobs.gov if they were motivated

Anchors aweigh! Marines will be able to go anywhere -- literally -- now that the government has requisitioned an expensive set of porta-potties

'More awesome, less suck' -- the firm contracted to publish the government's flagship environmental science journal is a specialist in social media targeting female consumers

The LinkedIn contract, first reported in the Washington Free Beacon, includes 'Work With Us' banner ads and 'gold'-level user pages commonly purchased by private companies, all designed to drive job-seekers to Attorney General Eric Holder's law enforcement agency.

The DOJ provided its contractor, the Reston, Virginia-based Carahsoft Technology Corporation, with a not-so-helpful table of prices for LinkedIn's services, in which all the costs were listed as $0.

The agency contracting officer responsible for the award did not respond to a request for an explanation.

Uncle Sam is also busily spending on other projects, from portable toilets to valet parking.

The Department of Veterans Affairs green-lighted $450,000 for valet parking at VA Palo Alto Health Care System buildings in California.

Broken Xerox machines at the Department of Labor will keep cranking this year, thanks to a $252,000 copier repair contract with a Minneola, New York company.

Did you know the federal government operates a fruit fly production facility in Hawaii? Now you do

When the Department of Labor's copiers go on the fritz, they don't have anyone in-house who can fix them -- so here come the contractors!

The Bureau of Prisons is spending $68,000 on disposable, biodegradable food trays to feed inmates.

The Treasury Department's Bureau of Printing and Engraving must be shredding a lot of worn-out currency, judging from the $791,000 contract it issued last month for hauling away trash and recyclables in Texas.

Which lamps will the Department of the Navy buy? The $498,000 purchase order doesn't say

And the Department of Agriculture has agreed to spend more than $284,000 on an order for 5,400 shipping boxes to send fruit flies across the country from one facility to another.

'Each box consists of one (1) Fruit Fly Shipper, one (1) Fruit Fly Shipper Liner, two (2) Fruit Fly Scored Pads, two (2) Level Stands, two (2) Level Separators, and one (1) Top Level Separator,' according to the contract.'

The finished boxes are to be delivered to the government's 'fruit fly production facility' in Waimanalo, Hawaii.

In California, the Department of the Navy is set to pay $409,000 for portable toilets at the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command in the town of Twentynine Palms.

The contract is 106 pages long.

The same agency is spending $498,000 on lamps, and sending $196,000 to Lockheed Martin for '8GB flash memory' – thumb drives – and other computer parts.

The most expensive contract among those MailOnline flagged from December was an $11 million outlay from the EPA for a company to publish Environmental Health Perspectives, the agency's academic journal.

How much does a recruitment ad on LinkedIn cost? Don't ask the Justice Department -- it appears to think they're free

Federal prisoners are eating off of these disposable and biodegradable food trays -- instead of something that can be washed and reused -- judging from one 68,000 contract

The Michigan company that won the contract, Brogan & Partners Advertising Consultancy, advertises itself online as an expert in social media marketing to women with the tagline, 'More awesome, less suck.'

Environmental Health Perspectives was accused in 2012 of participating in a human-experimentation study that exposed 41 people to airborne particles that the EPA says can cause death just hours after exposure.

One subject was taken to the hospital after experiencing hart trouble during the experiment.

The journal also caused a stir in 2012 when it published a widely mocked study claiming that fluoride in drinking water was poisoning children's nervous systems.
