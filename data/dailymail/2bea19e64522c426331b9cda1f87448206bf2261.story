Searching: Police are searching for Arnoldo Jimenez, 30, who has not been seen since Estrella Carrera, 26, was found dead in her bathtub on Sunday afternoon -  two days after the couple married

Carrera, a mother of two, was found around 3:30pm on Sunday in the 7800 block of South Rutherford Avenue, in the Burbank area of Chicago, according to police.

Carrera's body was discovered after her sister became alarmed when she could not contact her and asked police to conduct a well-being check at the home, officials said.

When police called at her third-floor home, she was found with multiple stab wounds in an empty bathtub. There were no signs of forced entry into Carrera’s apartment, according to investigators.

Following their City Hall wedding ceremony, the newlyweds celebrated with friends and family renting a limo and then going on to a nightclub.

The pair were last seen around 4am on Saturday morning, said officials.

Jiminez was last known to be driving a black, four-door 2006 Maserati with Illinois license plate L641441.

Police declared the death a homicide on Monday after autopsy results confirmed she died from stab wounds.

She was due to pick up her two children - her nine-year-old daughter and two-year-old son- from a family member on Saturday afternoon but did not show up, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Her cousin Sandy Lopez said Jimenez was the father of her youngest child and it was a quick wedding. They had been in an on-off relationship for three years.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Clerk's office said that Estrella did not yet have a marriage certificate on file but had applied for a marriage license on May 2.

Lopez said Estrella called her on Friday to invite her to a party but didn't mention that it was a wedding party.

She told the Chicago Tribune: 'She didn't tell anybody. She didn't want to tell me she had gotten married, but she sounded happy.'

She said she personally did not approve of the marriage or the relationship but was not speaking for the rest of her family.

'He's just a person who had problems,' she said. 'She was a beautiful mother, person, sister.'

Relatives say Carrera was a Spanish language translator for a welfare agency. She just moved to the area about two months ago, neighbors told CW33.

Neighbor Jason Tokarczyk, 24, told the Chicago Tribune she was quiet and generally kept to herself.

He said he frequently saw her with her son but was surprised to hear she had married.

'I've never seen her with a dude...I figured she was a single mom,' said Mr Tokarczyk. 'She was quiet as a mouse.

'I was shocked out of my mind to hear something had happened to her.'

Another neighbor said police were searching all around the area in dumpsters and garbage cans for a weapon but came up with nothing.

Another local resident described the 26-year-old as 'pleasant' but said she was relatively unknown.

Burbank police were releasing few details but said the death was being investigated by the South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force.

Police are calling it an isolated incident stemming from a domestic situation, but did not say whether anyone was in custody as of Monday.
