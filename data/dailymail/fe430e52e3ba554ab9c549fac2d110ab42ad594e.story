Joe Calzaghe is preparing to take his place in boxing's Hall of Fame in expectation of George Groves succeeding him as Britain's latest world super-middleweight champion.

The Welsh maestro, who retired undefeated after a stellar career, goes to America for his ultimate individual honour immediately after the mega rematch at Wembley between Groves and Carl Froch.

Calzaghe will be among the record 80,000 crowd at the national stadium on Saturday week to watch the two aspirants to his throne resolve their bitter dispute following the controversy of Froch's stoppage win last November.

Defiant: Joe Calzaghe insists he will not come out of retirement to face the winner of Carl Froch vs George Groves

The animosity between Froch and Calzaghe as they vie for their place in ring history is well documented, but the man who retired undefeated did his best to set that aside as he weighed up the prospects for Wembley.

First, Calzaghe insisted that he would refuse to come back to face the winner, even for one hundred million dollars.

Although he did say: 'Maybe if I'd been even a couple of years younger than I am now, at 42, I would have considered beating either of them. But not now. I wouldn't risk my legacy.'

Then he ran the rule over the fight which is capturing the imagination of the British public and promising to galvanise massive interest in boxing in Britain.

He said: 'You can make a case for both Carl and George. Has Froch become too old? Has Groves improved enough?

'To begin with it's ironic for me to think that George was born in the same hospital as me in Hammersmith, west London, just a few years later.

'Is youth on his side? Well, you have to ask yourself if Carl can improve on the first fight as he is coming up to 37. But then again, can George follow up from his surprising performance in that one and go one better?

'The issue hangs around whether Groves is a 12-round fighter. Not everyone has that distance in them. Carl has because, like me, we should've been 15-round men.

'It's a question of the stamina. Froch still appears to have the cardiovascular capacity to go any distance. I expect we're going to find that out about George.

'Froch is beginning to look like he's slowing up but then he will take Groves more seriously this time. Groves is faster but does he have the steam for a long fight?

'In the end I look at it and think that George, with his backing-off style, would've been more of a problem for me if I ever thought of coming back to meet one of them. So if push comes to shove I'd go for him.

'Although in my own mind I believe that in my prime I would've beaten either of them, James DeGale, who I think can give them both a lot of trouble, and Andre Ward, who is similar to Bernard Hopkins, but who I got the better of.'

Calzaghe 
happily agrees that Froch-Groves II is good for British boxing and will 
generate renewed fascination with the hard old game. But ask him who he 
admires most of all throughout his half-a-lifetime involved in the ring 
and he says: 'Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Tommy Hearns and Roberto
 Duran. They were involved in great fights against each other.'

Hagler
 is the pick of the bunch, who since marvellous Marvin always attends 
the Hall of Fame ceremony, he is looking forward to making his 
acquaintance for the first time in the first week in June.

Calzaghe said: 'I've had the pleasure of meeting Sugar Ray several times but never Hagler and I can't wait.'

He was talking at a Boxing Writers’ Club lunch in London which he recalls was held in the same restaurant in which he announced his signing for legendary manager/promoter Mickey Duff 21 years ago.

Although he knows he could still make a fortune from driving himself out of retirement to face Froch or Groves - albeit not as much as one hundred million dollars - he says: 'I always promised I would stay retired and I will. It is a great honour for me to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. It’s very emotional for me and my father Enzo, who was the perfect trainer for me.

‘If I were to risk my place in history by coming back too late and sacrificing my unbeaten record then, never mind the money, I'd be miserable for the rest of my life.'

Froch-Groves II will be televised live on May 31 on Sky Sports Box Office.
