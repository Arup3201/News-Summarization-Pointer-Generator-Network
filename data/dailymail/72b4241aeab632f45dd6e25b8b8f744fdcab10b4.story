Sol Campbell rubbished Arsene Wenger's complaints about Tottenham's defensive style - instead blaming his side's slow build-up play for their 1-1 draw in the North London derby.

Former Arsenal and Spurs centre back Campbell was speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports and refused to accept Wenger's excuse that Tottenham 'didn't play' as the Gunners lost more ground on early title favourites Chelsea.

Arsenal held an impressive 69 per cent of possession - something Wenger pointed out - but had to rely on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's late equaliser to deny Tottenham an away win after Nacer Chadli's opener.

And Campbell was unimpressed with his former manager's decision to blame a lack of ambition from Spurs on Arsenal's failure to take three points from Saturday's late kick-off. 

'Arsenal should have realised that spurs wanted those two banks of four, to keep it tight,' Campbell said.

'Once Spurs moved it into the middle of the field that’s when they could counter-attack very quickly. But some of the buildup play was very lethargic and they were taking their time so that’s why Spurs got the result today.

The Gunners face Chelsea next after a Champions League meeting with Galatasaray - and Campbell says Wenger could learn from the deep-sitting tactics that their North London rivals employed at the Emirates.

'They might have to say, let’s play how Tottenham were playing. You’ve got to be disciplined. Chelsea are firing on all cylinders and someone like Diego Costa will be difficult to stop.'

Arsenal will likely be without Mikel Arteta and Aaron Ramsey for that key clash after Wenger claimed they had 'no chance' of playing after being taken off injured on Saturday.
