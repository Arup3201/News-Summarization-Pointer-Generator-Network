Thieves have stolen Mario Balotelli’s Porsche as well as gold and watches after breaking into the Italy and AC Milan forward’s house.

Balotelli was out at dinner with his brother Enoch and came home to his house in Limido Comasco to discover he had been burgled. The car was later found abandoned.

Balotelli wrote Saturday on Twitter: 'I feel empty! No emotions ... But always fighting for the few people I love. They deserve it.'

Bad week: Balotelli had to chase someone down after his mobile phone was stolen

The incident comes shortly after someone tried to steal Balotelli’s phone outside a nightclub, sparking a brawl as he chased the thief down.

However, Balotelli did have some good news this week when he was named in Italy's provisional 30-man World Cup squad by boss Cesare Prandelli.

The Azzurri kick off their Group D campaign against England in Manaus on June 14, before games with Uruguay and Costa Rica.
