Large parts of Southern California below mountain passes, canyons and foothills have been buffeted all week by the region's notorious Santa Ana winds.

Spawned by surface high pressure over the interior of the West, the Santa Anas form as the cold air flows toward Southern California, then speeds up and warms as it descends in a rush toward the coast. Some of the most extreme gusts reported by the National Weather Service topped 70 mph.

These offshore winds also raise temperatures to summerlike levels. Many areas have enjoyed temperatures well into the 80s.

California is also under the influence of a persistent upper-level ridge of high pressure anchored off its north coast that has also kept the region generally warm, dry and clear.

 A group of 27 orange-clad Los Angeles County Inmate Firefighters are among the 800 or so personnel tackling the Colby fire.

Under a scheme developed by the county, eligible prisoners are transferred from Los Angeles County Jail to the Los Angeles County Fire Department Inmate Fire Suppression Camps.

‘This is a way to keep them out of county jail, offer them training and an education’, said Nicole Nishida, spokesman for the LA County Sheriff’s Department.

One incentive for working on a county fire crew is that each day of work equals a day off their remaining sentence.
