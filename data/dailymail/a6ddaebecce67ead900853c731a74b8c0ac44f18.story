A 25-year-old woman was charged Wednesday with the murder of a California woman who was beaten by a group of people while waiting in line outside a Santa Ana nightclub.

Vanesa Tapia Zavala was arrested on Monday and is accused of taking part in the Saturday morning beating that left 23-year-old Annie Hung 'Kim' Pham brain-dead.

Zavala, who pleaded not guilty to the murder charge, faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted.

She was ordered to remain jailed in lieu of $1 million bail and is due back in court January 30th for a pretrial hearing.

Charged: Vanesa Tapia Zavala, 25, of Westminster, was charged with one felony count of murder for her alleged role in the death of Kim Pham, according to the Orange County District Attorney¿s Office

Behind bars: Vanesa Tapia Zavala was charged with one felony count of murder for her role in the death of Pham, who was beaten early Saturday morning outside the The Crosby club in downtown Santa Ana. Bail was set at $1 million

Zavala is a woman with only a traffic ticket on her record.

Pham was beaten about 12:20 a.m. Saturday outside the Crosby Bar and Nightclub.

She was declared brain-dead Sunday, but was kept on life support so her organs could be harvested.

She was taken off life support Tuesday and died around midday, police said.

Four other suspects - two women and two men - are still at large, police said.

Pham was waiting to get into the nightclub with friends when an argument started with another group of club-goers, escalating into a fight, according to police.

Killed over a photo? Kim Pham was knocked to the ground and savagely beaten by a group of men and women after a friend said she may have accidentally ruined their picture by walking in front of the camera

Plea: Posters have been put near the crime scene appealing for information about the attackers

Zavala was identified through video taken by bystanders at the scene on their cell phones.

The
 argument that sparked the fight may have started over an accidental 
“photobomb,” which refers to when someone messes up a photo being taken.

A
 friend who wanted to remain anonymous told the LA Times that Pham 
accidentally walked into one of the photos being taken by a group of 
three women and two men.

An argument started between that group and Pham and her friends. Pham was beaten and left unconscious at the sidewalk.

Zavala's
 attorney, Kenneth Reed, told reporters after his client's arraignment 
that she was knocked down during the melee, and he doubted reports that 
it was a beat-down.

'I 
refuse to believe that people of this community would watch a woman 
stomped to death by five people and nobody would do anything,' Reed 
said. The lawyer characterized it as 'a melee, a bunch of people 
fighting.'

Reed says he’s 
been contacted by one of the potential suspects – and friends of Pham 
who say they’ve spoken with people involved in the incident – said the 
violence outside the club was chaotic and involved at least a half-dozen
 other people.

Zavala lost 
her phone in the brawl, and it was recovered later by police, according 
to Reed, who said she is 'devastated' by the violence.

'Your
 day is fine, your life is fine, you have a 5-year-old son, you go out 
one night on a Friday with your boyfriend and then your life is turned 
upside down and you find out someone is killed,' Reed said.

'No matter what the situation is, you're going to be devastated.'

Disturbing: Police were quick to announce that they did not believe the attack was motivated by race, as the area has a large Vietnamese community that were concerned about a possible hate crime

A
 second attorney, Michael Molfetta, a criminal defense lawyer who said 
he’s been contacted by a potential defendant, said “there is a lot more 
to this.'

'Nobody deserves 
the fate Pham got. But it was not race related or a photo bombing. It 
was simply a stupid argument over somebody inadvertently bumping into 
somebody else that escalated very, very quickly and very, very 
violently.'

The charge against Zavala carries a maximum sentence of 15 years to life in prison.

Patrol officers called to the scene found Pham unconscious on the sidewalk.

Police
 on Wednesday continued their investigation into what prompted the 
deadly assault, which began with an argument among people waiting in 
line to get inside the popular nightspot.

The
 fight that ended with Pham unconscious has drawn national attention as a
 short video circulated online showing a group of people in nightclub 
attire wrestling and kicking a figure on the ground in front of a crowd 
of about 50 people. In the video, one person is visible crouching to 
take another cellphone video. A bouncer from the club appears to try to 
intervene, well after the violence began.

Brutal: A video that friends claimed showed the attack was shared on Facebook. It shows people trying to break up a fight in the street while someone is lying on the ground

Annie
 Pham, 23, graduated from Chapman University last year with a psychology
 degree and had worked to raise money for breast cancer awareness.

Downtown
 Inc., a coalition of Santa Ana businesses, offered a $5,000 reward for 
information leading to the attackers. The city matched the reward, 
bumping it up to $10,000.

In her personal blog, titled: ‘These Are the 7 Biggest Fears That You Need To Avoid
 Having In Your Twenties’ on the website Elite Daily, Miss Pham calls on
 people her age to stop being fearful.

On
 the ‘Fear of Missing Out’, a rationale she said was ‘empty’, she wrote:
 ‘We all have this guilt that tells us we should be doing one thing when
 we choose to do another.

‘We may even choose to justify it by 
announcing it on Facebook or Twitter to receive likes and lighthearted 
comments that perhaps make us feel more at ease about being “out 
studying the babes instead of studying for a midterm.” Don’t be a fool. 
Attend to the things you need to do in order to grow a better you.’

She
 tells her contemporaries to stop worrying about ‘Not Being Invited to 
the party’, instead claiming that it is merely the universe’s way of 
‘telling you that you’ve got more valuable things to be doing with your 
time’.

On the scourge of social media, in the third part of her 
missive, ‘Fear That We Don’t Compare’, she wrote that spending hours 
stalking people online is pointless.

‘We are taught that with photos,
 we select the ones where smiles are fresh and forward — the good is 
often highlighted. As for your own life, don’t forget that sometimes the
 most beautiful lessons in life stem from the unconventional. The 
elevated focus on showing everyone how much of a superstar you are on 
social media is quite unnecessary.’

She explained that in ‘Fear of 
the Unknown, or What the Future Holds’: ‘The greatest harm we can do to 
ourselves is to not take the chance’.

Other ‘Fears’ she addresses include ‘Fear of Being Lonely’, ‘Fear of Rejection’ and ‘Fear of Getting Hurt’

‘Perhaps
 in our generation of self-promotion, egos yield a delicate tiptoe 
around the subject of getting hurt or being disappointed,’ she 
concludes. ‘However, we need to recognize that this fear should not 
paralyze us from feeling, living and loving.

‘If you are forthright 
in your own heart’s honest intent to love, you have nothing to worry 
about. Be bold, go forward, and love like hell.’

Scene: Investigators swarm the scene after the fight on Saturday morning. Police are looking for four suspects, while one has been arrested

Violent Police say a fight broke out between Pham and another woman, whose friends then stepped in

Miss Pham was rushed to hospital following the attack and listed in extremely critical condition.

1. Fear of Missing Out

2. Fear of Not Being Invited to the Party

3. Fear That We Don’t Compare

4. Fear of the Unknown, or What the Future Holds

5. Fear of Being Lonely

6. Fear of Rejection

7. Fear of Getting Hurt

Her
 family kept her on life support until they could donate her organs, 
according to the LA Times.

Her family only found out that she was an organ donor after she was admitted to hospital.

‘She
 would go out of her way to help others and never expect anything back 
from them’, her stepsister Lisa said. ‘That’s the kind of person she 
is.’

Police are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to 
the arrests of four other suspects wanted in connection to the incident.

"The
 suspects were listed as two males and three females, Hispanic, between 
20 and 25 years of age," Santa Ana Police Corporal Anthony Bertagna told
 KABC.

Authorities are appealing for witnesses to come forward with footage of the attack after receiving reports that club-goers had taken out their cell phones.

One video clip shows a person lying on the floor as they are surrounded by a group of people. A guard can be seen attempting to separate the crowd as witnesses look on, horrified.

Memorial
 posters and flowers have been placed outside the club, and friends and 
relatives spread posters online pleading for information into the 
attack.

A donation page was also set up for the family, but Pham's 
sister later said that they did not want to receive donations and would 
be returning the money.

Anyone with any information is urged to call the Santa Ana Police Department at (714) 245-839. You can also call OC Crime Stoppers at (855) TIP-OCCS.
