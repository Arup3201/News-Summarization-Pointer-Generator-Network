The super rich living in Britain including wealthy foreigners like Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich must pay more council tax, Boris Johnson has said.

The imbalance between business rates levied on firms and what better-off residents were paying in council tax had become 'absolutely crazy' and had to be resolved, the mayor of London said.

Speaking to MPs on the Communities and Local Government Committee, Mr Johnson said: 'If you compare what a Russian oligarch is paying on his stuccoed schloss in Kensington in annual council tax compared to what such a gentleman might be asked to pay in Paris or New York or anywhere else, it is quite stunning the difference.

'No one has yet grasped that.

'I'm by no means an advocate of a mansion tax. In fact, I vehemently oppose such an idea. But we cannot go on forever without looking at our council tax valuations.'

'It is high time local government was given responsibility for a revaluation of the council tax.

'I do not think any government is going to have the cojones to do that and you may as well get on and devolve it to the cities.'

It could mean a reduction in council tax for many people, especially in outer London, he added - suggesting additional council bands were one option.

Downing Street has previously rejected plans to change the current system fearing middle-class homeowners could be pushed into higher bands.

In 2012 Mr Johnson also rejected plans for a mansion tax proposed by Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg.

 this month shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said wealthy 
foreigners who buy properties in the UK as 'piggy banks' would be hit 
with higher taxes under Labour plans.

 it was a ‘scandal’ that foreigners were buying up homes they had no 
intention of living in, pushing up property prices for Britons.

There are growing calls from across 
the political spectrum for action to curb overseas investors adding to 
'rampant’ house price inflation', forcing millions of middle and low UK 
earners out of the property market.

Foreign buyers are not just acquiring high-value London properties - but also mid-market new homes.

A recent report said just 27 per cent of new builds in central London were bought by UK citizens, with more than half sold to people from Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Russia.

A paper from right-wing think tank Civitas paper earlier this month also argued that non-UK residents should only be allowed to buy a property here if their investment will also boost the number of homes.

The idea reflects a system in Australia, where all non-residents wishing to purchase property must apply to that country's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB).
