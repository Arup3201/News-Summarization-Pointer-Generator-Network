Suspicions: Head football coach Todd Hoffner, 46, was arrested on allegations that he had possessed and produced child pornography

A Minnesota football coach continues to face two child pornography charges, despite investigators revealing that no evidence of child porn was found on the computers taken from the home.

Minnesota State, Mankato coach Todd Hoffner was arrested and charged after three videos of his children were found on his work-issued cellphone when he took it to the university for service.

His attorney and wife have publicly rejected the charges as ridiculous, saying the videos simply captured the family's children being silly.

A search of computers taken from the Hoffner home has found 'no additional items that would be considered child pornography,' said Blue Earth County Sheriff's Captain Rich Murry. That information will now be forwarded to the county attorney's office.

Hoffner was charged last month with 
one count of using minors in a sexual performance or pornographic work 
and one count of possessing child pornography. Both are felonies.

His attorney, James Fleming, said he was confident that authorities would not come up with any additional evidence and the case will focus on the images recovered from the cellphone.

'So now we are dealing with: Are these images in fact, child pornography?' Fleming said. 'And I believe that it's going to be shown very clearly - they are not.'

The videos include images of Hoffner's children behaving 'silly' after a bath, Fleming said.

Prosecutor Mike Hanson did not return phone messages seeking comment.

Hoffner was arrested after the videos were found and escorted off a football practice field in August. He remains on leave pending a university investigation.

At a hearing on Friday, Fleming pressed for greater access to the cellphone videos, saying he needed them to mount his defense. Fleming has seen the images but must go to the Blue Earth County Sheriff's Department to view them - with officials looking over his shoulder.

Blue Earth District Court Judge Krista Jass took that request under advisement.

According to an affidavit in the case, audio on one of the videos includes a child saying: 'Dad, that's not the show, make him do it right,' and a man's voice says, 'Do it over.'

Fleming said the suggestion that Hoffner was directing his children is 'absolutely wrong.'

'I've seen that affidavit. And I have seen the video. And that representation is wrong,' he said.

The affidavit says university officials also came across a video of a roughly 40-year-old 'naked adult male jumping off a boat skinny dipping.'

Fleming said Hoffner is frustrated, and the publicity has made the case difficult.

Support: Hoffman's wife Melodee has publicly rejected the charges as ridiculous saying that her husband is innocent and charges against him are 'ridiculous and baseless'

'He's very protective of his family,' he said.

Hoffner is entering his fifth year as head football coach at Minnesota State, Mankato. He led the team to the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 and a share of the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference title in 2011.

He has a 34-13 record at Minnesota State, Mankato, and was named NSIC coach of the year in 2009.
