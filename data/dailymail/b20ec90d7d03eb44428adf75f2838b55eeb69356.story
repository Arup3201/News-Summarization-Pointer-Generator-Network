THE shocking testimonies of four women who accuse the late  Sir Jimmy Savile of sexually abusing them as children can be revealed today.

The Mail on Sunday has been given an exclusive preview of an explosive 55-minute ITV documentary to be screened on Wednesday.

In Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, in which the women, now all middle-aged, offer compelling accounts of how they were groomed by Savile for sex when they were teenagers.

The documentary also features damning contributions from former BBC production staff who reveal that the star’s predatory behaviour with girls as young as 12 was an open secret. And a child protection expert who investigated the claims for ITV tells the programme he is convinced Savile, who died last year, would face arrest if still alive.

Mark Williams-Thomas, who for 12 years was a detective and child protection officer, spent a year talking to Savile’s former victims.

He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They were in awe of an individual who could give them a great number of benefits, and so the abuse could go on and on unchecked. The women thought no one would believe them then, and even now they are terrified of the potential backlash from his fans and from his estate. But I have no doubt that on the evidence I have gathered, if Savile was still alive I would be banging on his door to get him nicked.’

Mr Williams-Thomas was a child 
protection officer with Surrey Police and worked on the prosecution of 
pop impresario Jonathan King on charges of sex with underage boys.

Since leaving the police, he has become a consultant on child protection and fronted the ITV documentary To Catch A Paedophile.

He said: ‘Early last year I was asked by a contact if I was aware of allegations that had circulated for years about Savile and young girls and if I knew of an investigation into a complaint made to Surrey police in 2007.

'He put his hand up my skirt. There were dozens of times after that. When I was 16 it turned into full sex.'

Val, 15, Top Of The Pops 1968

‘When Savile died, I began an investigation and was put in contact with several women who alleged they had been abused by him.’

He
 has learned that at least two complaints were made to Surrey Police 
about Savile while he was alive, though the force refuses to say whether
 he was formally interviewed.

The
 shocking conclusion of his investigation is that Savile, who was the 
face of Top Of The Pops for three decades as well as Jim’ll Fix It, 
groomed girls as young as 12 for sex.

Savile’s victims tell strikingly similar stories in the documentary, which is to be screened at 11pm – two hours after the watershed.

Explosive: The documentary claims that Savile, who famously presented the first ever Top of the Pops, gave young girls money and cigarettes in return for 'sexual favours'

Until his death at 84, Savile was 
seen as an outlandish but avuncular star who loved tracksuits and 
ostentatious jewellery. But despite his tireless charity work, he never 
escaped dark rumours about his lifestyle. The ITV investigation makes 
concrete allegations for the first time.

One
 woman identified in the programme only as ‘Val’ met Savile on Top Of 
The Pops in 1968 when she was 15. She says: ‘He got me into an alcove in
 his dressing room and pushed me against the wall. He put his hand up my
 skirt.

'He invited me to his hotel and before I knew it he had me on the bed and was having sex. It was repulsive what he was doing to me and other girls.'

Angie, 15, Top Of The Pops 1968

‘There were dozens 
of times after that when I met him. He’d pin me up against a wall, a 
corridor, wherever he could he’d grab an opportunity. When I was 16 one 
of these occasions turned into full sex.

‘He
 kept saying he wouldn’t go the whole way but when I tried to push him 
off he held me down with his body weight. I later discovered he’d given 
me a sexually transmitted disease.’

She adds: ‘I was very young and he was
 a charismatic and powerful personality. There was an air about him that
 he had power and contacts and you didn’t want to mess with him.’

Another woman, ‘Angie’, tells a 
similar tale of meeting Savile on Top Of The Pops in 1968, also aged 15.
 ‘He invited me to come round to his hotel and before I knew it he had 
me on the bed and was having sex with me.

‘He
 had a little couch in his dressing room and we’d have sex there or 
sometimes he’d pin me up against the wall. It was all very unemotional 
on his part. I was a teenager and very naive and I blamed myself for 
what he did.’

Had he been alive: Savile, who died last year, would have faced arrest if still alive, a child protection expert claims on the documentary

Wilfred De’Ath was a young 
Oxford-educated BBC producer working on radio talk show Teen Scene when 
he first encountered Savile. Mr De’Ath, now 75, appears on the ITV 
programme and was also interviewed by The Mail on Sunday. He said he was
 stunned when Savile invited him to a Chinese restaurant called The 
Lotus House, a popular celebrity haunt in London, where he found the DJ 
sitting on a banquette with a young girl.

‘He
 told me he had met the girl – who was small and waif-like – on Top Of 
The Pops the night before. She was very young, I’d say near to 12.

'I remember the teacher introducing me and saying, "Be nice to uncle Jimmy". I was told to sit on his lap and I felt his hand go up my jumper.'

Charlotte, Duncroft schoolgirl 1974

‘Savile
 arranged to meet me in a London hotel called The Mascot, which was a 
very seedy place off Baker Street, the next day. When I called up to his
 room he told me that he was in bed with the girl I’d met the night 
before and he even got her to talk to me on the phone. I remember her 
saying, “Hello Mr Producer”. I didn’t want to carry on talking.

‘I told him he was living incredibly 
dangerously and he replied, “No, no, no, I’m far too valuable to the BBC
 for anything to happen to me”.

‘It appeared to be generally accepted 
that he was usually in the company of young girls. I know it sounds 
cowardly, but there was the feeling that if I grassed to the top end of 
the BBC then I would have been out.’

Another
 BBC employee, Sue Thompson, was a production assistant on TV show 
Speakeasy in 1978 when she encountered Savile with a girl she believes 
was 14.

Former detective Mark Williams-Thomas approached Esther to look at interviewed women who say Savile sexually abused them

‘As I walked into his dressing room, 
he was sitting in a chair with the girl on his knee. His left arm was 
resting on her leg and he was kissing her. There was no doubt in my mind
 it was a sexual advance.’  In January it emerged that a probe by BBC2’s
 Newsnight into allegations about Savile had been shelved. There were 
suspicions of a cover-up, but Newsnight editor Peter Rippon told The 
Mail on Sunday it was dropped for editorial reasons. ‘We were pursuing a
 particular angle which we were unable to substantiate,’ he said.

Singer Coleen Nolan, who does not appear
 in the ITV programme, revealed four years ago that she was horrified 
when Savile intimately cuddled her in 1979 on Top Of The Pops when she 
was 14. She said: ‘He was all over me. I could see my sisters glaring, 
“You touch her and we’ ll kill you!” – and they would have done.’

In 2007, Surrey Police received 
complaints that Savile had abused pupils at the now defunct Duncroft 
Approved School for Girls near Staines, for which he did charity work in
 the Seventies. The investigation was dropped after a Crown Prosecution 
Service lawyer advised no further action be taken.

In ITV’s documentary two ex-Duncroft 
pupils talk about Savile. One, Charlotte, recalls being introduced to 
him in a caravan in the grounds in 1974. ‘The teacher told me to sit on 
his lap and then I felt his hand go up my jumper. I shouted at him, 
“What do you think you are doing?” and the next thing I knew I was 
dragged out of the caravan by two of the staff.

‘I was told that Savile did nothing but good for the school and that I needed to apologise. I was put into isolation for three days.’
