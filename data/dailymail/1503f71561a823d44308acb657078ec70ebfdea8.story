Councillor Robert Bleakley has been branded the 'most expensive' in Britain after running up a £2,500 phone bill calling sex chatlines

A councillor has been branded the 'most expensive' in Britain after running up a £2,500 phone bill calling sex chatlines and using his mobile to send 'inappropriate' and sexist messages.

Robert Bleakley, who has an £11,000 allowance as a representative of Tyldesley in Wigan, Greater Manchester, also used a work computer to watch pornography and did not bother attending a meeting in five months.

He was found to have sent a message saying: 'Aren't they f*****g idiots. No wonder women are just cooking and washing material.'

In one text, discussing the court case of former politician Chris Huhne and ex-wife Vicky Pryce, he said 'I hope she likes porridge' and that he hoped she would be sexually assaulted in jail.

But the Independent councillor has retained his seat and  allowance after turning up at his first meeting in five months.

Wigan Council boss Lord Peter Smith told a council meeting at Leigh Town Hall, that Mr Bleakley was the country's 'most expensive councillor at £2,000 an hour', considering the number of meetings he has been to.

'Even a banker would be embarrassed at that rate', he told the council.

Mr Bleakley has refused repeated calls for him to quit despite an investigation that found he had also used his work mobile to send explicit text messages.

He also deliberately altered an email to try to jeopardise a senior employee's job.

The Tyldsley councillor was also banned from speaking to female council staff after the chat line bill was revealed in September.

Under council rules, Mr Bleakley could have been removed from the council for non-attendance if he had failed to appear on Wednesday. 

Police were also called to the meeting after Councillor Bob Brierley refused to leave the chamber.

In 2004 Mr Bleakley was disqualified for three years after he verbally abused a female cleaner at Wigan town hall and threatening to get the sack after a minor traffic accident.

The Standards Board of England, which oversees councillors' conduct, investigated him and ruled that he was 'aggressive, domineering and intimidating'. 

He stood as the Lib Dem's parliamentary candidate for Worsley, Greater Manchester, in the 1997 and 2001 general elections.

At the time of the 2004 investigation he was leader of the Liberal Democrat group on Wigan Council.

He was suspended again for six months in 2010 after being accused of bullying an ex-policewoman who got a job as a community safety officer and branding her 'that woman' during meetings.

He had also been investigated by police over accusations of misconduct in a public office but was told he would face no criminal charges.
