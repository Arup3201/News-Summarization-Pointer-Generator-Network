A new contraption that enables adults to carry children on their shoulders hands-free so they can 'use a cell phone or walk the dog' has sparked a torrent of hilarious reaction.

SaddleBaby, priced at $89, features a chest strap and a foam padded seat that fits over the shoulders - the infant is then secured in place with Velcro ankle straps.

While product makers tout it as a 'safe and fun way to bond' with children, many commenters have been less enthused about the device, with one humorously writing on Gizmodo: 'Just wait till your kid has to go potty and you can't unstrap him fast enough!'

Another sniped: 'If you need a device to carry your child 
on your shoulders then maybe you should not have them up there in the 
first place. Seriously, it's not that hard.'

A father added in agreement: 'Somehow I managed to haul around my kid on my shoulders with just maybe my shoulders as the "saddle".

'I
 cannot imagine hauling around a saddle for the kid, however, especially
 given the fickle nature of kids: "Okay, I want to get down...carry 
me!...Okay, I want to get down...carry me!"'

One remarked that the SaddleBaby appears to be a 'dad-only' piece of kit as the chest strap makes it 'incompatible with female breasts.'

But while it's built for the male body, some men said that they would never wear the accessory because it would make them feel like an 'upright-walking pack mule'.

However, one parent lauded the invention: 'This is amazing 
for me since my kid has a neuromuscular disease and can't walk or hold 
his own weight very well.

They continued: 'I put him on my shoulders but after a while he 
begins to slip and it hurts my back/shoulders. This harness looks amazing in concept. Hopefully, it works that way in practice.

SaddleBaby's creators state on the website that their patented invention 'replaces the traditional method of needing to hold your childâ€™s ankles with a much safer and practical system that uses high quality materials, industrial Velcro and adjustable buckles to secure your child.'

A promotional video highlights the benefits of giving hands-free shoulder rides.

'In this 
busy multi-tasking world that we live in today we need out hands to do 
more, hold siblings, bags, dog leashes, cell phones, cameras, water 
bottles, you name it,' a voice-over says.

SaddleBaby is currently available to purchase online and will launch at retail stores across the U.S. over the coming weeks.
