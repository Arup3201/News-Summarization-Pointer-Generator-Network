The Environment Agency was accused last night of putting wildlife before people after it emerged that work to flood defences on the main rail line into Cornwall was delayed so a bird survey could be completed.

Just a few days before storms destroyed the seafront at Dawlish and cut the rail link, the agency said it could not act to protect it from the sea until it had studied the impact of improvements on the local birdlife.

Lord Berkeley, a former rail industry executive, yesterday suggested in the House of Lords that the agency was ‘looking after birds before humans’.

Officials said at the meeting that plans for ‘repopulating’ the Dawlish beach with sand, effectively moving back the coastline, would have to consider the consequences for local birds.

Rare species including avocets and black-tailed godwits have also been sighted.

About
 85 yards of the sea wall at Dawlish was destroyed by the raging seas on
 Tuesday night, causing a stretch of the railway to collapse into the 
sea.

Network Rail, 
which has spent £10million on shoring up the line in this spot since 
2001, estimates that it will take at least six weeks to repair.

Last night an agency spokesman said: ‘We do not recognise the description of the recent meeting with  Network Rail and Peers.

The
 focus of the meeting was to discuss the Exeter Flood Risk Management 
scheme and its interaction with the rail mainline going into Exeter St 
Davids.’

Meanwhile, ministers indicated  the rail line to Cornwall could be  permanently re-routed.Transport
 Secretary Patrick McLoughlin ordered a review of alternative inland 
routes to prevent a repeat of this week’s devastation.

The last Labour government ruled out replacing the line in 2006.

One
 long-term option is to reopen an abandoned stretch of the former 
Southern Railway from Exeter to  Newton Abbott which closed in 1958, 
meaning trains would no longer stop at Teignmouth or Dawlish.

The line has been closed to trains for the foreseeable future and it is not known when it will re-open
