Sheryl Sandberg is now the lead character in a graphic novel.

The Facebook COO was hailed as an inspiration when she published Lean In, her call to arms for women to realize their full potential.

And her words were so inspiring, it seems, that they warranted an entire fantasy series titled Female Force: Sheryl Sandberg.

Star: Sheryl Sandberg is the title character in a 32-page comic about her life from birth to reaching Facebook

Female force: It borrows heavily from the Facebook COO's book Lean In, calling on women to push themselves

The 32-page biography, available on iTunes for $3.99, serves as a short account of her life as an author and businesswoman, documenting 'her family, her education, the formation of her belief system, and her personal and professional successes make up her story'. 

It is the latest in the Female Force series produced by Bluewater Productions, following artistic depictions of a number of successful women including Michelle Obama, Mother Teresa and Hillary Clinton.

Mark Zuckerberg is yet to star in a comic. 

Sandberg reportedly did not know about the biography until recently, according to Re/Code.  

It opens in Harvard in 1987, where she graduated in 1991 top in her class for economics.

The reader is taken through her career and personal life, including the pivotal moment when Mark Zuckerberg offered her a job.

'If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, you don't ask what seat, just get on,' the two-dimensional Sandberg explains, 'I leaned in further'.

Intelligence: The writer describes the heroine of the graphic novel as having 'intelligence' as a super power

Writer Michael L. Frizell and artist Angel Bernuy borrowed heavily from Sandberg's book Lean In, and quote speeches she has made.

A fiery scene between Sandberg and Zuckerberg uses words from a speech she made on 60 Minutes last year:

'Women hurt themselves by leaning back. They say, 'I'm busy,' or, 'I want to have a child one day. I couldn't possibly take on any more.

'I've never heard a man say that.'

Notable scenes include Sandberg's speech warning that women have a tendency to 'lean back' and men don't

Frizell told CNET: 'The comic will appeal to those interested in the lives of real people. 

'Sandberg doesn't need a cape and tights to make a difference. Her superpower is intelligence backed by innovation. She's a leader.' 

Darren G. Davis, president of Bluewater Productions said: 'Our goal is to show the behind-the scenes machinations - many of them ignored by the mainstream media - that resulted in Sheryl Sandberg becoming a leading voice in empowering successful businesswomen.'
