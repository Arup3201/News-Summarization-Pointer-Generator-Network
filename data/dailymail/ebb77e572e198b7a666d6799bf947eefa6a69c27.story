Barcelona defender Dani Alves is discussing a three year contract with Paris Saint-Germain.

The 31-year-old Brazil international is out of contract with Barcelona in the summer and has been offered to several Premier League sides. 

Alves's agent, Dinorah Santana, confirmed that her client was in 'advanced talks' with another club and the player was in Paris on Tuesday.
