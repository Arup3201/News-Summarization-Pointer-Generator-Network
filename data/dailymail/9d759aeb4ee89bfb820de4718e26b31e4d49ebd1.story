It is supposed to be the model multicultural state. But Sweden is facing problems of its own after gangs of immigrants spent a fifth consecutive night rioting  in Stockholm.

Officers are battling to keep the  capital under control after hundreds of cars were torched, a police station set alight and fire services kept from  a major blaze by a stone-throwing mob of youths.

To make matters worse, rioting has now spread to Sweden’s two other major cities, Gothenburg and Malmo.

The disturbances, which have lasted 
longer than the riots in England in the summer of 2011, started last 
week after police shot dead a foreign-born pensioner who threatened to 
attack them with a machete.

Left-wing activists came forward to accuse police of racism – a charge strongly denied by the Stockholm force.

Growing unrest turned to violence  
last  Sunday in a north-western suburb called Husby – where more than 
80  per cent of the residents are from overseas, mostly Turkey, Somalia 
and the Middle East.

Trouble then spread to some of the 
city’s most deprived areas, shattering the country’s proud claim that it
is a template for a successful and ethnically diverse society.

On Thursday night there were 90 
separate blazes in the  capital. Thirty cars were torched and there were
eight arrests – mostly of people in their  early 20s.

In earlier attacks, groups of up to 
100 rioters targeted schools, nurseries and shops – breaking windows and
setting buildings ablaze.

In Skogas, south of Stockholm, 
emergency services were kept from a fire in a restaurant when a gang of 
youths pelted fire engines with rocks.

And in nearby Ragsved a violent mob set fire to a police station – the second to come under attack in two days.

Destruction: Friday morning's riots, which also saw a second primary school set on fire, resulted in several shops wrecked, multiple vehicle fires across the city fringes and stones thrown at police

Aftermath: The primary school was completely destroyed by the fire which is being treated by police as arson

Lars Bystrom, a Stockholm police 
spokesman, said: ‘Such fires are mainly lit to lure  the police to the 
scene, who are then attacked.’

He admitted officers have been forced 
to change their tactics, saying: ‘Now if there is a small fire that is 
not likely to spread, and there is no risk to life, we will send out a 
patrol and keep an eye on it from a distance.

‘But we are not going to bring in the fire brigade unless it’s really dangerous.’

The attacks on emergency service 
workers have led to private security companies telling employees to stay
at home, as mobs have started attacking anyone wearing a uniform.

Several public transport routes have 
also been cancelled after rioters started hurling petrol bombs at buses.

Chaos: Police have been under attack by large mobs, pelting them and fire services with bricks and heavy rocks, preventing them from putting out fires across the city's fringes

The Foreign Office and the US embassy have warned visitors to stay away
from certain suburbs.

Government leaders have been stunned 
by the ferocity of the violence in a country which has long been touted 
as a paragon of social justice.

For decades, supporters of 
multiculturalism have pointed to  Sweden as a classic example of a 
society which allows immigrants to continue practising their  own 
culture while living peacefully alongside their host communities.

Around 15 per cent of Sweden’s 9.5million inhabitants were born outside the country.

The second largest group of 
immigrants, after the Finns, are Iraqis – numbering more than 125,000. 
Former Yugoslavs total over 160,000 and Iranians almost 65,000.

As well as setting cars ablaze, rioters also attacked a police station and a school and nursery

The unrest appears to have been sparked after police shot and killed a man wielding a machete on Sunday

While Sweden is still relatively 
affluent, with living standards among the highest in Europe, tension has
grown in recent years as the country struggles to cope with rising 
youth unemployment and an ever-growing influx of foreigners.

Unemployment for people born in Sweden
is only 6 per cent, but unemployment among those born outside Sweden 
currently stands at 16 per cent.

The country’s long-standing ‘open 
arms’ policy for asylum seekers has brought it to a  position where it 
has one of  the world’s highest proportions of asylum seekers relative 
to  its population.

Among 44 industrialised countries, 
Sweden ranked fourth in the total number of asylum seekers and second in
the number of asylum seekers relative to its population, according to 
figures from the United Nations.

The violence has sparked debate in the country on the effect of the government's social policies

Government leaders have struggled to 
explain or control the outbreak of violence, but the anti-immigrant, 
nationalist Sweden Democrats have soared to third place in the polls.

The party’s rise reflects the  concerns of many native-born Swedes that their country is  rapidly changing for the worse.

Sweden was ruled for decades by the 
Left-wing Social Democratic Party which has been committed to the 
creation of an  egalitarian society since it was founded in the late 
19th century.

It was ousted from power by the 
current ruling centre-Right coalition, which has failed to make major 
changes in the  country once dubbed ‘the most successful society the 
world has ever known’.

Stockholm, one of Europe's richest capitals, has the fastest inequality rate of any advanced OECD economy

Prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt 
stressed that everybody needed to take responsibility for their actions 
if calm was to be restored.

He added: ‘It’s important to remember 
that burning your neighbour’s car is not an example of freedom of 
speech, it’s hooliganism.

‘We have groups of young men who 
believe that you can and should use violence to change society. Let us 
be clear. This is not okay. We cannot be governed by violence.’
