Dennis Rodman has embarked on another visit to North Korea, meeting dictator Kim Jong Un despite growing reports of a string of state executions in the secretive state.

The former basketball star returned to Beijing from a 'diplomacy visit' last night, amid reports thatÂ  Kim had ordered the machine-gun execution of his former singer lover, Hyon Song-wol and 12 other entertainers on August 20 for appearing in an 'sex tape'

Some of the musicians were also reported to have had Bibles, which are banned in North Korea, when they were detained and all were treated as political dissidents.

But there were doubts surrounding the 
images of his trip supplied by the North Korean propoganda machine as one featuring a 
disembodied hand appeared to be photoshopped.

It suggests that the hand of state censors may have been involved in altering the images, and the trip may not be all it seems.Some observers suggested an interpreter had been removed from a shot to make Kim Jong Un look better.
