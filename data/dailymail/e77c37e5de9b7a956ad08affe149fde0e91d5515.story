As family, friends and cricket legends gathered at a Sydney hospital to say goodbye to Phillip Hughes, the 25-year-old's sister Megan sat with devastated cricketer Sean Abbott to offer him support.

Australian captain Michael Clarke also spent time with the distraught bowler whose ball felled Hughes, as the international cricketing community expressed support and solidarity with Abbott amid growing concern for his emotional well-being.

Cricket Australia's team doctor Peter Brukner said Abbott had been receiving a lot of support from teammates and from Cricket NSW.  

'When he came to the hospital yesterday, Michael Clarke came down and spent a significant amount of time with him. Phillip's sister, Megan, also came and spent significant time with Sean,' Dr Brukner said.

'Obviously what Sean has gone through is an incredibly traumatic experience, as it has been for everyone present on the field that day.'

The young batsman had been excited to return to long-form cricket when he bowled the short delivery which struck Hughes, causing the injury which would claim his life.

Others in the cricketing community have spoken about their fear of the 'freak' accident impacting upon Abbott's cricketing career, as well as his emotional well-being.

Former test quick Staurt Clark said that Abbott had just been 'doing his job', which was to 'intimidate' the batsman, reported The Herald Sun.

'I’ve heard at different stages that [Abbott] is struggling a little bit with it all,' Clark told Fox Sports News.

'[But] he’s out there to get Phil Hughes out. It’s a competitive sport. It’s professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment,' he said.

Abbott, 22, was comforted at the hospital by players including Nathan Lyon

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten tweeted that Abbott had 'done nothing wrong', and that he hoped the bowler knew that Australians shared his grief

'You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don’t want that.' 

On Wednesday, Abbott returned to the SCG, where the unexpected accident occurred, for a team counselling session and was supported by teammates and team officials who have been concerned. 

Adam Gilchrist, former Australian wicketkeeper, acknowledged the trauma that Abbott was going through, tweeting 'May those footprints in the sand now support another young man in need. #SeanAbbott'.   

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott lead the public grieving for Hughes, but specifically mentioned the need to support the young bowler in his 'absolute' devastation, and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten tweeted that Abbott had 'done nothing wrong', and that he hoped the bowler knew that Australians shared his grief. 

Abbott delivered the ball that felled Hughes on Tuesday afternoon

Beyond Blue, an Australian initiative to help combat depression and anxiety, expressed the need for the Australian community to support Abbott through the ordeal.  

Former England paceman Alan Mullally, who left a batsman with severe head trauma during a club game in Perth, said Abbott would need to be carefully looked after.

'I had sleepless night for months after that,' Mullally recalled to The West Australian.

'I would wake up crying. I was devastated at first because I didn't know if he was going to live and then I was devastated because I did know that I had ended his career and all his cricket hopes and dreams.' 

All NSW and South Australian players are receiving counselling and psychological support in the wake of the delivery.

The Australian Cricketers' Association said it was monitoring Abbott, who delivered the ball, closely.

It was reported Abbott was struggling as a host of former Australian pace greats jumped to his support.

'[Abbott] has got a lot of support around him from his teammates and also the counselling services,' ACA CEO Alistair Nicholson said.

'He's someone who we're monitoring closely and we know he's got a lot of support around him.'   

On Thursday afternoon Abbott, 22, visited Hughes in hospital and was met warmly by his own teammates, friends of Hughes and cricketing greats such as Steve Waugh.

Looking pale and exhausted, Abbott arrived at St Vincent's wearing a black baseball hat at 2.30pm.

In the hospital's coffee shop, where some of the cricketers had congregated, Abbott was given some words of advice from Waugh, while spin bowler Nathan Lyons draped a comforting arm around his shoulders.

He then sat down and had a coffee with his teammates who were obviously rallying behind the young fast bowler.

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said Abbott, who cradled the injured batsman after he crashed to the ground, would get whatever help was required. 

'It says a lot about Sean doesn't it?' Sutherland said. 'Sean will have all the support he needs around him.

'I'm sure his teammates and everyone doesn't feel in any way ill of him for what happened. It's a freak, freak incident.'

Former Australian bowler Stuart Clark told Fox Sports he understood Abbott was 'struggling a bit' and said the incident was not his fault.

'He's out there to get Phil Hughes out. It's a competitive sport. It's professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment,' he said.

'I hope he's got support... You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don't want that.'

There is a long history between Abbott and Hughes who came up through the junior ranks of the NSW cricketing system and are close friends.

Former Test bowler Brett Lee said Abbott did not deserve any of the blame for the incident.

'You know you're always on edge bowling fast or being out there batting,' Lee told Channel 9.

'When you see something as shocking as this you really feel for Phil.

'I know first-hand that no one goes out there to try and maim a batsman, no one tries to hurt a batsman.' 

Lee's sentiments were echoed on social media by other sportsmen.

Cricket legend Glenn McGrath tweeted a message of support out to Sean Abbott.

'Our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott,' he tweeted immediately after his message to Hughes.
