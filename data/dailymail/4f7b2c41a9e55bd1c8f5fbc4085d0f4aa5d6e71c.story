A new reality show from the creators of Teen Mom, 16 & Pregnant, and Jersey Shore is set to expose the agonising 30-day wait faced by adoptive parents in which the birth mother can legally take their child back.

A summary of the 'The Baby Wait' series posted on the Logo
TV website reads: 'What if you knew your newest addition could suddenly
be subtracted? Your bundle of joy no longer yours.'

However producers insist that they are not trying to 'scare' childless parents and the show is aimed at educating viewers on the ins and outs of the adoption process.

Brent Zacky, senior vice 
president of programming for Logo, told the New York Post: 'I don’t think we’re going to scare 
people out of the [adoption] process.

'The desire to have a child and create
a family is deeply rooted in many people.

'And I think if you have that 
desire, you’re going to pursue it, knowing that there’s some uncertainty
in the process.'

And participants of the show also believe it successfully demonstrates how adoption can be a difficult process for all parties.

Paul Siebold who appears in one episode with his domestic partner, Mark Krieger, said: 'I think we are showing what true
life is.'

Genavieve Diggs, 18, said she often thought about taking her daughter back during the 30-day period

As the couple are tracked during the 30-day window their anxiety builds as they realise their new daughter could be taken away at any moment as her birth mother, 18-year-old Genavieve Diggs, has the right to back out of the arrangement at any time.

Siebold adds: 'When Morgan was put
in our arms, all these hopes and dreams started bubbling up for us.

'But while you [still] have those 30 days, it’s always in 
the back of your mind: ‘What if Gen calls?’'

Meanwhile Genavieve revealed that she often thought about taking her daughter back and raising her on welfare and food stamps.

'There would be times I would be in 
my room by myself looking at pictures or watching videos and I would 
start crying thinking, ‘Why do I hurt so much? I miss her. I need her 
back in my life.

'But at the same time, another little voice snapped in the back of my head and said, ‘You can’t take care of a baby.’

And in the end she officially decides to give up her baby for adoption so that she can concentrate on her school work and family life.

More adoptions occur in California each year than any other state followed closely by New York.

In many states including New York birth mothers have 30 days in which they can legally change their minds and take their babies back.

Executive producer Tony DiSanto said: 'This show is really about family ultimately and that's something everybody can relate to.'

The series debuts Tuesday, October 30 at 10 p.m. EST on Logo.
