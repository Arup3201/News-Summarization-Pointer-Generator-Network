Tyson Fury will take on Belarusian giant Alexander Ustinov on Saturday - the man his original opponent Dereck Chisora was sparring when he fractured his hand.

Fury has boxed just once in the last 15 months and looked set to endure yet more frustration after Chisora pulled out, but he has now accepted the fight with the 37-year-old in Manchester.

Ustinov, who at 6ft 7in is still two inches shorter than Fury, has lost just once as a professional - to the undefeated Kubrat Pulev.

It was during his final sparring session with Chisora on Friday that the Londoner broke his left hand but he waited until Monday to announce his decision to pull out.

The heavyweight rematch had been expected to be rescheduled for September but that must now be in considerable doubt.

Ustinov was last in the ring in November when he outpointed David Tua and will present an altogether different challenge than the shorter, stockier Chisora.

'The first thing is I’m happy to still be fighting this
Saturday and that the fans will get what they paid for and see a good fight,'
said Fury.

'We’ve had a hard training camp and I’m in the shape of
my life, expecting to knockout Chisora, but now I’m going to have take it out
on Ustinov and make sure he takes the full force of my anger.

'Chisora will now see what he was going to get on the
night - knocked out.  Strangely, I’m
going to break the man who broke Chisora’s hand.

'Full credit for Ustinov for taking the fight, he’s a big
lad, more importantly he’s a credible world ranked opponent and he must fancy
his chances.

'We’re two gladiators, but he’s going to feel what it
like against a world class heavyweight like me.'

Fury, 25, meanwhile, looks set to be banned from boxing in Britain after admitting he will not attend a hearing into his foul-mouthed rant at a press conference last week.

He was summoned to appear in front of the British Board of Control on August 13 but insists he has no intention of turning up.

'I
 am on holiday on the date of that meeting so I won't be attending and, 
even if I were in the country, I wouldn't be going because I am not 
interested,' he told the Daily Star.

'I
 have attended these meetings before. I have heard what they have got to
 say. They want to treat you like a school child and pretend they are 
teachers and give you a smack on the wrist for being a bad boy.

'I am going on a two-week cruise, starting from Venice, going round Italy, Greece and Turkey.'

Fury said he plans to fight under the Irish flag as he holds an licence with the Boxing Union of Ireland.

His latest brush with the Board comes after he aimed an expletive-laden tirade at a journalist during a press conference.

When the journalist asked Fury if he had any respect for the sport, he retorted: 'If you don't like the station, change the channel b****.

'This is my show, I do what I want. This is boxing, it isn't tap-dancing. If anybody doesn't like that they shouldn't be here.

'I'm in fight mode, kill-mode. I don't apologise, it is what it is.'

He also used explicit language when talking about Chisora, David Haye and world champion Wladimir Klitschko.

The Board later issued a statement to say that Fury's licence would be revoked if he did not turn up to the hearing.

That followed a £3,000 fine issued last year after Fury insulted Liverpool boxers Tony Bellew and David Price.
