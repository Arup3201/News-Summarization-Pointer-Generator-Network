A Chinese man's plan to make a romantic proposal to his girlfriend on top of a mountain was ruined - after thousands of other people had also decided to watch the sunrise.

So many people had turned up at Huangshan Mountain – a famous tourist destination in the city of Xi'an in western China's Shaanxi province – that Ding Fan even ended up getting separated from his friends and his girlfriend Xiang Yu, 29, as he struggled to find a free spot to ask her to marry him.

The romantic 31-year-old said: 'I met my girlfriend at this spot five years ago, and decided to pop the question at the same place while watching the sunrise.

Failed proposal: Mr Ding Fan was planning to pop the question to his girlfriend Xiang Yu in same spot he first met her five years ago but an influx of tourists ruined his romantic plans

Chinese nationals enjoy a week-long public holiday in early autumn but the large influx of tourists during 'Golden Week'  has meant that attractions have been jam-packed

'I told some of my friends to meet me here secretly but there were so many people it was impossible to find any of them, and they had the ring and the flowers. 

'I even lost my girlfriend at one point. When I found her again I realised that if I did kneel down I might not be able to stand up again and she probably wouldn't be able to see me, so I just gave up and cancelled the plans.'

The couple then made their way back to the cable car to head down from the mountain, struggling to see the sunrise over the heads of the thousands of visitors who were all there with the same idea.  

Luckily Mr Ding Fan then met his friend with the flowers and the ring, and seized the opportunity to get him to photograph them as they headed down and he popped the question. 

'It was a crowded cable car where she finally said yes, but at least we did have a view in the background and I can certainly say it was an engagement to remember.'

The 'Golden Week' was created by Chinese Communist Party officials to promote tourism within the country.The plan however has caused major problems for the tourism industry as it struggles to cope with the huge number of visitors. 

All across China tourism destinations reported record numbers for the 'Golden Week', but the flood of tourists has meant that attractions have been jam-packed and locals have had to face huge traffic delays on all transport networks.

As far as Mr Ding Fan was concerned, Huangshan Mountain will always be in his memories, but that is where it's going to stay.  'I don't think I will ever come here again,' he said.
