The five-year-old girl shot dead by a five-year-old boy in a tragic accidental shooting during a playdate has been identified today.

Noelle Aston Shawver of Blackfoot in eastern Idaho died on Wednesday after visiting a home in Chubbuck, police said. 

Police have released few details, citing an ongoing investigation.

A funeral is planned for this coming Wednesday in Blackfoot.

Police say emergency workers responded at about 3pm on Wednesday and took Shawver to Portneuf Medical Center in Pocatello. 

The hospital confirmed later in the evening she had died.

Police said adults were in the home at the time of the shooting but were in a different room from the children.

Investigators have not released the type of gun involved or said how the children got access to it.

Kaeley Shawver, Noelle's aunt, told Kpvi that the family did not blame the boy who shot her niece or the boy's family.

The girls' parents, Drew and Stacie Shawver, also have two younger children, a boy and a girl.

The family have been raising money for Noelle's funeral expenses through their GoFundMe page. 

As of Friday morning, more than $19,000 had been donated to the fund. Relatives said that the money would also go towards counseling and supporting the family in time away from work. 

Family told Fox 9 that Noelle was a 'bright and loving' child who was due to start kindergarten in the fall.  

There has been an outpouring of support and donations to the devastated Idaho family after daughter Noelle, five, (pictured right) was shot dead by another child on Wednesday 

Noelle was shot by another child at a home she was visiting. Police said adults were in the home at the time of the shooting but were in a different room. It is not clear how the child got access to the gun
