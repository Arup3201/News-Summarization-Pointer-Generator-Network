A dwarf actor who played an Ewok in Star Wars and a goblin in Harry Potter escaped jail again yesterday for flashing.

Nicholas Read, 41, was drunk when he exposed himself to two medical students on a train and took a picture of one of them on his mobile phone.

The 4ft 5in actor had just enrolled on a sex offenders’ treatment  programme after being convicted of a similar offence, and the new crime meant he was in breach of a suspended jail term.

Guilty: Nicholas Read, 41, pictured left at Manchester Crown Court today, flashed his penis at two medical students on a train to Manchester  He played an Ewok in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return Of The Jedi, right

He also had convictions for a string of other sex offences including making an obscene phone call and groping a woman.

But he was given a 16-week prison 
sentence suspended for three years after a judge said he was making 
progress – and that the latest offence had helped him in ‘seeking to 
conquer this sexual deviancy’.

Manchester Crown Court heard that 
Read had been working in York and drinking on a train back to Manchester
in January when two female medical students in their mid-20s got on.

Conviction: Mr Reade, who is 4ft 5ins, is pictured at an earlier court appearance. He was also convicted in July last year of exposing himself to a schoolgirl

Nicola Carroll, prosecuting, said: ‘He took a seat next to the window and two women got on.

‘They were 25 years old and one sat 
next to him and the other sat opposite her. He took some pictures of the
other girl on his mobile phone.’

She said Read exposed himself to the 
women and they immediately contacted the guard. Read was arrested on 
arrival at Manchester Piccadilly station. ‘He admitted that he had a 
problem and said “I have gone and ruined my life, why have I done it?”’,
Miss Carroll added. ‘He admits that he traumatised and terrified the 
students.’

Earlier the court heard that in 
October 2010 Read sat next to a schoolgirl on a London to Leicester 
train and performed a sex act on himself under a juggler’s hat for half 
an hour.

He was given a 20-week suspended sentence.

Yesterday Judge Robert Thomas QC 
said: ‘If somebody breaches a suspended sentence it means immediate 
imprisonment and in the vast majority of cases it is. It is not going to
happen in your case. You have been taking a community sex offender work
group and have been making real progress.

‘Curiously this further offence seems in a way to have helped in you seeking to conquer this sexual deviancy you have.

‘You have been very frank and 
straightforward and in the past often denied what you have done. You are
now finally facing up to the difficulties you face. I’m not going to 
disrupt that progress by sending you to prison for only a matter of 
weeks. It would be better to see if the progress you are making can be 
contained.’

But he added: ‘The courts will have 
to send you to prison if you commit another offence. That is inevitable 
and nothing can save you.’

Read, of Cheadle, Staffordshire, had 
pleaded guilty to indecent exposure. Earlier the court heard how Read’s 
height earned him ‘blockbuster’ roles as an Ewok in Star Wars: Episode 
VI – Return Of 
The Jedi and a goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.  He 
was convicted of making an obscene call at a hotel in 1995, and in 2004 
he indecently assaulted a woman and was given a conditional discharge.

In mitigation Rachel Faux, defending,
said: ‘He does not seek or expect any sympathy from  the court because 
of the nature of his medical condition dwarfism. Nor does he seek to 
excuse what he has done.’

Read will be supervised by the probation service and continue with the sex offender programme.

Big screen roles: Read played a goblin in the film Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone, starring Daniel Radcliffe. The star has now been told he must inform the authorities if he wants to travel by train
