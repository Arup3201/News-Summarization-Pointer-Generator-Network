Oprah Winfrey’s love of truffles clearly knows no bounds.

Just a few days after Instagramming a series of pictures of herself on a truffle hunt in Italy, the TV host turned up to top Miami restaurant Prime 112 with her own truffle in tow, before presenting the rare white truffle to the chef so it could be shaved over her Kobe Beef burger.  

One witness told the New York Post, 'Oprah not only rolls deep in a huge toe-crunching SUV and more security than the president, she also rolls with her own personal truffle.'

Just before dinner, the 60-year-old's driver accidentally ran over a woman's foot outside the restaurant, but fortunately no serious injuries were caused.

The talk show host showed concern for the woman, immediately getting out of her Cadillac Escalade to check on her well-being.

Oprah has been vocal about her truffle obsession in recent months.

Magic mushroom: Earlier this month, Oprah enjoyed a tour of the Sabatino Tartufi Truffle factory in Umbria, Italy, which she called the 'best trip ever' on Instagram

Teamwork: Oprah's best friend Gayle King shared this photo of the talk show host with Ms King's daughter, Kirby Bumpus, on the truffle-hunting expedition

'I’m a truffle freak,' she told reporters at the premiere of The Hundred-Foot Journey in August.

'I walk around with truffle salt. That’s on my rider for the hotels - truffle salt, truffle oil. I want to go to Alba [in Italy] and do the truffle hunt with the pigs,' she added.

Earlier this month, she fulfilled that dream, traveling to Umbria, Italy, to hunt for the delicacy with her best friend, Gayle King, and Ms King's daughter, Kirby Bumpus.

'Best trip ever! thank you @SabatinoTruffles for helping me fulfill bucket list dream. Here's to TRUFFLES!,' she wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of herself holding up one of the rare mushrooms.
