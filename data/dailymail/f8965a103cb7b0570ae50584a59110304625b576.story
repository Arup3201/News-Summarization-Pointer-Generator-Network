Europe captain Paul McGinley has lined up former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to speak at the team dinner at Gleneagles on Tuesday evening.

Ferguson is a friend of assistant captain Sam Torrance, and turned up to watch the European team practice on Tuesday morning. 

His presence continues a recent tradition of star performers from other sports saying a few words in the team room.

Four years ago it was Welsh rugby legend Gareth Edwards while Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola spoke at Medinah last time.

'He's a guy that I played with in the JP McManus pro-am about 15 years ago and that I've seen now and again over that time, and when I became captain I asked him," McGinley said of the former Manchester United manager.

'Of course he was more than willing to help. But the one thing he asked me to do was keep it really quiet. Walking around (the course) is not keeping it quiet, is it? We wanted a bit of a surprise for the players but I guess it's not a surprise.'

West Ham fan McGinley joked that Ferguson would not be giving any of his team the famous "hairdryer" treatment, with the Hammers coincidentally making the trip to Old Trafford on Saturday.

'Although I'm a West Ham fan, I've always loved the way his teams played and there's a number of things that he's dealing with that he was particularly good at that I think he'll be a particularly strong fit,' McGinley added.

'He's asked me a lot of questions and I know he's very keen and looking forward to tonight. He's a big fan of golf, as we know. He knows Rory (McIlroy) very well and Rory is a big Man Utd fan. Not everybody in the room is a Man Utd fan, so that should be a bit fun.

'This is not about him being a headmaster and coming in and preaching to them. He's very aware of that. This is relaxed. This is a conversation. There will be questions coming back at him.

'They all love football and a chance to spend a bit of time with one of the greats in soccer doesn't come around very often, particularly with somebody they all admire. In my dealings with him, he's been absolutely fantastic and I know he'll be great with the players.'

Ferguson has turned up at a number of Scottish events on the European Tour over the years and is believed to play to a handicap of 18.
