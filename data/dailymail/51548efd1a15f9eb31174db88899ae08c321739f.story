A couple have been ordered to demolish their eco-home they built without planning permission as they tried to live the 'Good Life'

Daniel and Lora Newman put a two-bedroom wooden cabin in their field as they attempted to support themselves from the land.

But a court heard the couple from Carharrack, Cornwall, did not apply to the council before building the five metre by six metre cabin - so they were told to tear it down.

Eco-home: Daniel and Lora Newman have been forced to tear down their five metre by six metre cabin in Carharrack, Cornwall, because it was built without planning permission

Small-holding: The couple tried to live with their children self-sufficiently on the three-quarters of an acre plot

They were given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £1,500 towards council costs at Truro Magistrates Court.

Mr Newman said he has now demolished the property and would be moving to France to live and work.

He said: 'We have spent Monday through to Wednesday night taking down our cabin with the help of my family. It felt such a shame to take it down but we really had no choice.'

Daniel, 37, and Lora, 32, built the two-bedroom wooden cabin in their field in Carharrack in 2009 on a three-quarters of an acre site they bought to live a self-sufficient life.

But the council took enforcement action after the Newmans continued living in the property with their two children for more than four years.

This was despite repeated warnings that they did not have the correct planning consent.

Hayley Jewels, the council’s enforcement group leader, said: 'The house was built in an unsustainable location where planning permission would certainly not have been granted.

'The house was built in an open countryside location.

'Planning policies advise that housing should be situated within settlements and that isolated homes in the countryside will require special justification, such as an essential need for a rural worker to live at their place of work which, in this instance, was not the case.

'The council has tried to resolve this matter with the landowners since 2009, however this was unsuccessful and the council was left with no alternative but to issue the enforcement notice and when this was not complied with, take court action.'

More than 1,000 people signed an online petition supporting the couple’s desire to stay but the council took legal action after they breached two enforcement notices.
