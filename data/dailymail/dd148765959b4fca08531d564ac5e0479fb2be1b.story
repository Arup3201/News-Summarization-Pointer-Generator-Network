A 47-year-old British holidaymaker was able to fly to Spain using her 17-year-old daughter's passport, despite the fact the youngster has different skin colour and a distinctive afro hair-do.

Blundering officials at Southend Airport in Essex failed to notice that Sally Nayler is a middle aged white woman while the passport she was using showed a mixed race teenager.

Ms Nayler had accidentally picked up daughter Shelby's passport when leaving in a rush for a hen do in Alicante, Spain.

Mix-up: Sally Nayler was able to fly from Southend Airport to Alicante, Spain, after accidentally picking up her daughter Shelby's (right) passport

She
 was left distraught days later when officials in Alicante refused to 
allow her to board her return flight to Britain after she failed to 
produce her own passport.

She said: 'My mouth dropped to the floor,' she said. 'I was literally about to step on the plane. I have never been so frightened in my life. I was shaking and I was sweating. I was crying.

'Other passengers were getting upset for me. A lot of them had been on the flight out with us. They were saying: 'let her on, let her on'.

'I said I'd been there since Friday. The EasyJet man asked if I had any photo ID but I'd left my driving licence at home because I was going on a hen do.'

Sally, a single mum of one, said she was so traumatised that an aunt who was also on the hen do volunteered to stay with her while the rest of the 12-strong party flew home.

'The Spanish policeman said he would have let me go, but it wasn't down to him.

'We went to the EasyJet desk at the airport and the woman there apologised and said it was EasyJet's fault at Southend. They shouldn't have let me fly on that passport.'

EasyJet booked Sally and her aunt onto a flight the following day, and gave them free tickets.

They also helped them find an hotel near the British Consulate, were they went for emergency travel documents the following day.

Sally had to pay 121 Euros for a new passport - which invalidated the brand new one she'd left behind - plus a night's accommodation and food.

Probe: An investigation has been launched into how Ms Nayler was able to board the flight from Southend Airport in Essex with her daughter's documents

British Consulate staff worked with airline EasyJet to arrange for an emergency passport and a return flight the next day

She said 
that on the flight out she handed her passport and boarding pass to 
EasyJet staff at Southend, as they put their hand luggage in the hold 
because of a shortage of space.

She assumed that it had been checked.Â 

She added: 'I think it shows security is lacking at Southend Airport. I could have been a criminal or a terrorist.

'They couldn't have checked my passport properly, as my daughter is of mixed race and has an afro hairdo.'

Ms Nayler, from Benfleet, Essex, had been
 travelling with 12 friends and family for the weekend hen do when she 
picked up her daughter's passport by accident as she left home on 
Friday, April 25.

The worried mother was forced to contact the
 British Consulate after being refused entry to her return flight from 
Alicante, Spain, just days later.

Grounded: Spanish authorities refused to allow Ms Nayler to board her return flight home

British Consulate staff worked with airline EasyJet to arrange for an emergency passport and a return flight the next day.

Ms Nayler added: 'I'm a grown woman, but it was really scary.

'Thankfully, an aunt refused to fly back without me and stayed with me.

'The EasyJet desk at Alicante got me a hotel near the consulate and arranged a flight back the next day on an emergency passport, which cancels my old passport.

'If Southend had spotted it, I could have got my father to bring mine.

'We had a wonderful weekend, but this spoilt it.'

A spokeswoman for Southend Airport has apologised for the mistake and said a full investigation was currently underway into the incident.

She said: 'Security and the safety of passengers and aircraft are of paramount concern.

'A full investigation is in progress into the circumstances outlined by

Ms Nayler and appropriate action regarding staff and procedures will be taken when we know the outcome.

'We'd like to apologise for any distress caused by her experience.'

A spokesman for the airline said: 'EasyJet works closely with all of our airports to ensure the safety and security of all passengers and staff. 'We are investigating how the passenger was able to travel from London Southend with incorrect documentation.

'We can confirm that the correct passport details had been submitted online in order to gain access to the boarding pass, however as an additional measure a visual identification should have occurred prior to travel. 'When the documentation issue was raised at Alicante, airport staff assisted the customer in arranging an emergency passport, alternate flights and the customer has since received compensation for all associated costs.'
