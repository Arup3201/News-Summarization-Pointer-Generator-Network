A life without cell phones, iPads or WiFi may seem a daunting prospect to many of us, but in the town of Green Bank, West Virginia, where every electronic device is banned, the residents like it that way.

The remote town of just 147 people  in the Allegheny Mountains falls in the National Radio Quiet Zone, where wireless is banned across 13,000 square miles.

The ban is in place to minimize disturbance next to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, home to the world's largest steerable radio telescope.

While it may seem like an undesirable destination for today's tech-savvy citizens, many people are moving to the area as they believe it is better for their health.

Silence: Residents living near the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in the National Radio Quiet Zone in Green Bank, West Virginia are banned from using phones or wireless devices to lower interference

Diane Schou is just one of the residents who believes she suffers from electromagnetic hypersensitivity, or EHS, which leaves her in pain whenever she is exposed to radio frequencies.

Schou explained to Slate that before she and her husband escaped to Green Bank in 2007, she lived in Cedar Falls, Iowa, where she suffered headaches, twitching muscles and chronic pain.

She first noticed the pains in 2002 when a wireless provider put up a tower near their farm.

'I was extremely tired, but I 
couldn't sleep at night,' she told Slate. 'I got a rash, I had hair loss, my 
skin was wrinkled, and I just thought it was something I ate, or getting
older.'

She soon began to connect the pains with 
triggers - mobile phones, driving past signal towers - but the phone 
company dismissed her claims, even though she has no doubt of the cause.

'I'll say, "Oh, I have a headache," and then someone's cellphone will ring,' she said.

Relief: Diane Schou, pictured with her husband Bert, said that whenever she is exposed to radio frequencies she suffers headaches, twitching muscles and chronic pain, but these have eased in Green Bank

They found out about the Radio Quiet 
Zone in 2007 and when they visited, she immediately began to feel better
- so they sold half of their farmland and made the move.

In their new home, they use a landline 
and an Internet-connected computer which does not have WiFi. They have 
struggled to find a refrigerator with low enough emissions, so fill up 
on ice instead.

Zone: The area is 13,000 square miles and 147 people live in the town of Green Bank

'Life isn't perfect here,' she said. 'There's no 
grocery store, no restaurants, no hospital nearby. But here, at least, I'm healthy. I can do
things. I'm not in bed with a headache all the time.'

While she is not alone - she believes 36 others like her have moved to the area to escape electronics - the condition is not recognized by the World Health Organization.

Around five per cent of 
Americans believe they have EHS, but the WHO has not connected the symptoms 
with exposure - and there is only brittle scientific evidence.

'EHS has no clear diagnostic criteria and there is no scientific basis 
to link EHS symptoms to EMF (electromagnetic field) exposure,' the WHO states. 'Further, 
EHS is not a medical diagnosis, nor is it clear that it represents a 
single medical problem.'

James Rubin, a psychologist at King's 
College London, added that he has carried out extensive studies but 
found sufferers could not always tell when there were blasted with 
electromagnetic frequencies compared to harmless ones.

'It is definitely the case that some 
people experience symptoms that they attribute to electromagnetic 
frequencies,' he told Slate. 'But is it really these frequencies causing 
the symptoms? At the moment, we can say that there simply isn't any 
robust evidence to support that.'

Rural: Schou said that other residents were not very welcoming to EHS sufferers but she has no choice

Other residents of Green Bank are also skeptical of those who say they have EHS, Schou said. They are reluctant to rent out their homes to them in case they ask for special treatment.

She added that after she asked the town to remove florescent lights at the community center, she has had packages stolen from her porch and was told: 'We don't want your kind here.'

Although she said she sometimes feels discriminated against, she said she has no plans to move.

'I can be outdoors. I can go to church, I can attend some celebrations, I can be with people,' she said. 'Living here allows me to be more of a normal person.'
