The family of a convicted terrorist could lose their home after police enacted anti-terror laws to seize the property.

Munir Farooqi, 54, was jailed in September after attempting to recruit two undercover police officers for jihad in Afghanistan.

Now in the first case of its kind his £200,000 property could be confiscated because he turned it into a secret Al Qaeda recruiting school.

Convicted: Munir Farooqi, left, was found 
guilty of soliciting multiple murder and a series of terrorism offences,
while Matthew Newton, who Farooqi recruited, was convicted of preparing
acts of terrorism and distributing terrorist publications

But Farooqi’s outraged family say they
are entitled to a private and family life and will use the Human Rights
Act to fight the move.

Under Clause 23a of the Terrorism Act 
2000 a convicted terrorist can have their assets seized by the state 
under a forfeiture order.

Next year a court will decide whether the property was used as a base to commit the offences.

Farooqi, a market trader, used his stall in Manchester as a front to persuade people to join a holy ‘Jihad’ war against the UK.

Targeting young British men, he used 
literature and films to brainwash them, successfully converting a former
British soldier and an estate agent.

Over a two year period Farooqi - who 
boasted of being a jihadist and was detained in Afghanistan in 2001- 
tried to persuade people visiting his stall to travel to training camps 
in Afghanistan.

He was arrested in November 2009 after
two white undercover policemen infiltrated the recruiting school and 
underwent radicalisation ceremonies in the basement of his terraced 
home.

Under Clause 23a of the Terrorism Act 2000 a convicted terrorist can have their assets seized by the state under a forfeiture order

The act states the court can order any property or money to be forfeited if it was in the possession or control of the convicted person, used for terrorism purposes, intended for the use of terrorism, or if they court believes it will be used for the purposes of terrorism

During the undercover investigation 
one of the detectives taped Farooqi boasting: ‘If we die, we win. You 
have Allah on your side, how can we lose?

‘You know Jihad is not about you 
giving your life away. If we’re going to go there you make sure you take
at least 40 or 50 people with us so we’ve done something.’

In September Farooqi was convicted of 
three charges of soliciting murder, preparing for acts of terrorism and 
distributing terrorists publications after a four month trial. He was 
jailed for a minimum of nine years.

Recruiting ground: Farooqi used Longsight Market in Manchester to sell fanatical Islamic manuals, books and DVDs and target young British men

Police say that because the majority 
of these acts took place at his terraced home in Longsight then Farooqi 
should forfeit the property.

Farooqi, who was born in Pakistan and 
came to the UK in 1962, became an active supporter of the Taliban in 
Afghanistan and went there in 2001 after the attacks on the twin towers 
of the World Trade Centre.

He was captured by authorities and jailed from November 2001 but was released in May 2002 and returned to the UK.

The Farooqi family say five adults and
two children - including an eight-month-old baby - will be made 
homeless if the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) go ahead with
the forfeiture order.

They have branded the move a ‘collective punishment’ and are set to hand a 5,000-name petition to officials in Manchester today.

Proven: Munir Farooqi was handed four life sentences for soliciting mass murder at Manchester Crown Court

Farooqi’s daughter Zulaika, 28, said: 
‘Leaving three generations of a family homeless, including an 
eight-month-old baby, is disgusting. It’s not British law, it’s just 
wrong and inhumane.

‘We have so much public support 
against this, not just from the Muslim community but also from 
non-Muslims too. This is not just a Muslim issue.’

His son Harris, 27, who was cleared 
of terror charges, said: ‘The women and two children in the house are 
totally innocent and should not be punished. We shouldn’t face 
collective punishment. This law has never been used against anyone 
before.’

The family’s solicitor Saeed Hafezi 
said: ‘It was never the intention of Parliament for applications to be 
made in this way. It is the family home and will continue to be.’

Human rights activist Naila Ashraf 
said: ‘It is totally unacceptable for the law, the police and the Crown 
Prosecution Service to criminalise a whole family like this. The UK is 
supposed to be a democratic country, do we really want to go down this 
route?’

But police have insisted the case was 
about seizing the property not evicting the family as the house was 
asset used for the purposes of terrorism.

Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley 
said: ‘The majority of these acts took place at 6 Victoria Terrace, the 
Farooqi family home.

‘The Terrorism Act 2000 makes it clear
that in certain circumstances, forfeiture proceedings can be brought 
against those convicted of terrorist offences.

‘If it can be shown to a court that 
Munir Farooqi was in possession or control of a property used for the 
purposes of terrorism, a court may make a forfeiture order for that 
property.’

She said: ‘We know this is an emotive 
issue within our community and we have met regularly with 
representatives from local mosques, elected members and others to hear 
their views.'
