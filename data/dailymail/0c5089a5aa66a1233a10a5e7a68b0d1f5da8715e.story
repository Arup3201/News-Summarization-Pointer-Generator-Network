Police are hunting for a girl of 14 who has disappeared with a 35-year-old convicted fraudster.

Lorna Vickerage ran away with ‘family friend’ John Bush three days after being taken from home and placed in foster care by social services.

Detectives urgently want to trace the ‘vulnerable’ teenager and are concerned about Bush because he is known to be a ‘liar, fraud and cheat’.

South Yorkshire Police say they do 
not know what his motives are for going off with the girl, but he is 
wanted for abduction of a child.

Lorna’s mother and father have appealed for her to hand herself in and stressed she is not in trouble.

Her father, Darren Griffiths, urged 
her to come home. ‘She’s quite independent,’ he said. ‘She’s usually 
quite sensible. But, obviously, I don’t know exactly what’s going off in
her head at the minute.

‘She’s quite mixed up. There’s been a lot going off lately. I just don’t know what she’s thinking.’

Mr Griffiths spoke about his daughter and Bush in an interview with ITV.

‘I think they are in some kind of 
relationship or something is going off between them,’ he said. ‘No one 
would go to the extremes he’s going to.

'I just want her to come home. Everybody is worried about her and we want to know where she is'

'He’s been warned to stay away from 
her but he hasn’t done.’

Her mother, Christine Vickerage, 36, wrote on 
Facebook: ‘my baby plz come home darling we love u so much.’

Beside a picture of her daughter, she
posted: ‘this is my gawgess lovin daughter if anyone as any idea were 
she could be would u plz contact me I just want her home safe thankyou.’

Scene: Police arrived at where Lorna Vickerage was staying and found the TV on and the back door open, missing them by minutes

Mr Griffiths and Miss Vickerage are 
no longer together. Lorna, from Doncaster, is believed to have met Bush 
at a caravan site, near her home, where he is thought to live.

'Please come home my gorgeous girl. Am so worried about you. I love you so much'

She went missing after leaving the 
Outwood Academy in Adwick, Doncaster, on Monday in her school uniform.

The last sighting of the pair was at 10.15am on Wednesday in Highfields,
Doncaster.

Detective Chief Inspector Craig 
Robinson said Lorna was introduced to a couple as Bush’s daughter and 
‘appeared to be safe and well and chatty’.

Police believe that they may be 
travelling in a silver Ford Mondeo, registration number Y753 CSH, which 
Bush had borrowed and not returned.

School: The teenager was last seen on Monday at 2.30pm at Outwood Academy (pictured today) in Adwick in her school uniform, although South Yorkshire Police said it was unlikely that she will still be wearing this

Bush, who is single, is a family 
friend. He has convictions for dishonesty and was given a suspended 
prison sentence earlier this year for frauds, including failing to 
return courtesy cars to garages and failing to pay for a holiday 
cottage.

‘What does concern me is he’s a liar, he’s a fraud, he’s a cheat and it’s what he’s telling Lorna,’ said Mr Robinson.

‘She is with a man three times her 
age who has no parental responsibility for her. He should not be with 
her. Where has he taken her, what’s he doing with her?’

In a message to the teenager, Mr 
Robinson said: ‘Lorna, you’re not in trouble. Your mum’s petrified, 
we’re concerned for your safety. Let us know you’re safe and well.’

Lorna Vickerage is on the run with a man who sparked a nationwide manhunt two years ago.

After he was found, John Bush was said in court to have spun a web of lies from Hertfordshire to Yorkshire, as he conned his way to thousands of pounds worth of goods and services.

He managed to get a  courtesy car from a Watford garage while his non-existent Porsche 4x4 was being ‘repaired’, before driving the £13,000 borrowed car north then abandoning it near York.

The ‘professional fraudster’ also asked a Thirsk garage to carry out £1,800 of repairs to another car he did not own, drove off in a second courtesy car and never went back to pay, the court heard.

Bush was given a 14-month suspended jail sentence in February this year for fraud, as well as 200 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £3,400 in compensation to some of his victims.

At the time of the frauds, he was said to have been homeless and in financial trouble. He had been in a relationship with a drug addict, but this had then ended and he was caring for an elderly man.
