The murder of aid worker Alan Henning backfired for ISIS as it 'shifted Muslim opinion' against the militant group, according to an anti-radicalisation expert.

Home Office specialist Sulaimaan Samuel says the orchestrated killing of the Salford taxi driver led the vast majority of Muslims to realise the group were beyond the pale.

The 47-year-old was beheaded by Islamic State (ISIS) militants in a video released on social media after he was captured in December while delivering food and supplies to Syrian refugees.

Salford taxi driver Alan Henning went to Syria to help refugees forced to leave their homes by civil war, but he was captured by ISIS extremists and beheaded in a video broadcast by the group

But a Home Office expert says his killing - at the hands of ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' - has shifted Muslim opinion against the group and could deter young British Muslims from travelling to the region to fight

Mr Samuel is a national safeguarding mentor for Channel, the Home Office's scheme to prevent adults and children becoming involved in terrorism.

He said Mr Henning's brutal killing shocked Muslims around the world and will deter many from going to the region to fight alongside the group. 

Mr Samuel told Sky News: 'The announcement that they were going to execute him, kill him - this really did shift public opinion and it shifted Muslim opinion wholesale.

'I would personally say to Alan Henning's family: do not think his death has been some type of waste because it hasn't, because his death at the hands of IS is the very thing that has caused the Muslim community to realise that what IS stands for is wrong and can never be condoned.

'In Alan's death he has managed to save thousands of lives now and in the future of people who might potentially have been drawn into going out.

'He will be saving lives in the future. What IS has done has backfired.'

Home Office expert Sulaimaan Samuel urged Mr Henning's family not to think his death has been in vain

Mr Samuel said the killing could, in the longer term, help to save 'many thousands of lives'

Mr Samuel added that the greatest threat from radicalisation now came from online content, and those travelling to a foreign country or being influenced by a single preacher happened 'much more rarely'.

Fellow Briton David Haines was also executed by ISIS militants, following the murders of US journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley, while another Briton, journalist John Cantlie, remains in the hands of the terrorist group.

The group appear to have changed strategy since the release of the series of beheading videos, with more recent films showing Mr Cantlie apparently reading a prepared script of the group's propaganda.

He was most recently seen last month in news broadcast-style footage in which the militants used him to air their claims that they hold much of battle-ravaged city of Kobane.

Mr Cantlie is a photojournalist who was captured last year while working in Syria.

His sister Jessica Cantlie has made an emotional appeal for her brother's return, pleading with the terrorists to reopen lines of contact to secure his safe journey home.
