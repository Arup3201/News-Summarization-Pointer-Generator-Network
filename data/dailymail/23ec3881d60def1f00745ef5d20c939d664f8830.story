Besiktas are interested in signing Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech if Jose Mourinho makes him available.

The Turkish club are hoping to take advantage of their partnership with the Blues if they allow Cech to find a new side during the January transfer window.

The 32-year-old has fallen behind Thibaut Courtois in the pecking order at Stamford Bridge and is yet to start a Premier League match this season.

Besiktas club president, Fikret Orman, told the Evening Standard: 'We are working together with Chelsea to sign a player. We have not held talks yet, however Chelsea have recently made an agreement with Besiktas.

'If Cech does become available I would support such a move.'

However, Cech's agent, Viktor Kolar, has played down the chances of his client moving in January.

He said: 'In the football world you can never rule out anything definitively, however, if you put together the facts with Petr's ambitions of a top-class goalkeeper, you will not be left with too many options.

'If we add to this the actual little need of these few clubs to search a new goalkeeper in the winter's transfer window, then you will find out that the chance of a transfer in the next weeks or months is not very high.'
