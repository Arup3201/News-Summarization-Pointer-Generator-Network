Claims by a former senior Victorian government adviser that he provided pornography for coalition MPs have been described as bizarre by Premier Denis Napthine.

Don Coulson was an adviser to former premier Ted Baillieu and was sacked in March last year just days after Dr Napthine became premier.

He has reportedly launched a County Court action claiming $67,000 and costs in redundancy payments he alleges he is owed.

The government has countersued, reportedly alleging Mr Coulson must return $30,000 in severance pay because he had pornography in his office.

Mr Coulson claims he ran a 'porn ring' that lent adult movies to coalition MPs and advisers from his office, the Herald Sun reports.

'These are bizarre and absurd allegations by a disaffected, sacked employee,' Dr Napthine told reporters on Thursday.

'They are not worth the paper they are written on.'

Mr Napthine said he was advised the material was inappropriate but not illegal, and said Mr Coulson had been sacked for other matters not related to this.

'Mr Coulson is lashing out as a disaffected, sacked employee and he is making bizarre allegations,' he said.

Mr Coulson, 59, was a former public servant who had worked with Mr Baillieu in opposition and was in charge of the government's Freedom of Information strategy before he was sacked, the Herald Sun reports.

It is also believed that some of the sexually explicit material included animal pornography.

But Mr Coulson has told the Herald Sun and ABC radio he will vigorously defend the allegation that he accessed pornography on any government system.

He told the ABC that he used USBs in his office to circulate 'hardcore' porn because staff were prohibited from acquiring such material on government computers.

The Age reported that Mr Coulson had 'at least three memory sticks'.

Deputy Labor leader James Merlino described the allegations as shocking and needed to be investigated by police.

'This would be breaking every rule, every code of conduct, common sense, decency,' Mr Merlino told Fairfax Radio.

'This needs to be referred and investigated immediately by Victoria Police and federal police in regards to allegations of illegal pornographic material. 

'Denis Napthine can't sweep this under the carpet. He needs to make a full and frank explanation to the parliament today. What did he know? How long has he known it? Has he spoken to each and every cabinet minister around his table?'
