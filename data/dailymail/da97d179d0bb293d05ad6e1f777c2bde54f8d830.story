Evidence: Glenis Freeman told police she tried to distract the animal from her husband

A widow described a fatal attack on her husband by a bull as a ‘complete and utter nightmare’, a court has heard.

Glenis Freeman, then 67, told police she tried to distract the animal from her husband Roger when it attacked him as they walked on a public footpath running across Underhill Farm in Stanford-on-Soar, in November 2010.

Mr Freeman, 63, died at the scene from multiple injuries, while his wife needed surgery for abdominal and chest injuries.

Farmer Paul Waterfall, who owns the farm in Nottinghamshire, is on trial at Nottingham Crown Court charged with manslaughter by gross negligence. He denies the charge.

Jurors were today played a DVD of the interview Mrs Freeman, now 70, gave to police two months after the attack once she had been discharged from hospital.

Describing the attack, Mrs Freeman told the officer: ‘It was as though we were in a nightmare.’

She said her husband was floored by the bull’s attack and could not get up. ‘Roger said "It’s got me in the groin. I can’t get up. I’m sorry Glenis, I can’t get up".’

Mrs Freeman told the police she tried to distract the animal from her husband by putting down her rucksack but it charged at her twice.

‘One of the times it hit me in the chest’, she told the officer. ‘I don’t know how many times it charged Roger.’

She said the couple had left Nottingham that morning after seeing a show at the theatre the night before.

They had planned to walk to Loughborough on November 12 and stay overnight at another hotel before walking on to their home in Glena Parva, Leicestershire.

They were walking along the public footpath at around 4.30pm when the attack happened.

She told police she was walking ahead when she heard an ‘oof’ from her husband and turned around to see him on the floor with the bull over him.

Mrs Freeman said she tried to distract the bull and at one point tried to get between her husband and the animal when it attacked her.

‘I felt like one time it was sitting on me. I think I was being rolled over as well. It then left me and went back to Roger.’

Describing the bull, she said: ‘He was brown. It was slobbering a lot. I think it looked at me straight in the face.

‘It looked as though, it wasn’t being playful, but it looked like it was wound up somehow, it looked excited. It wasn’t just a calm bull standing there... it looked excited.’

Mr Freeman, who was by this point wearing just his underpants and walking boots, shouted to her to go and get help.

‘The last time Roger said 
anything at all he shouted out ‘I’m sorry my baby, I can’t get us out of
 this’,’ Mrs Freeman told the officer. ‘We both had said ‘This is like a
 nightmare’.

‘The bull was attacking Roger. I think it was tossing him. It turned him around and that was when he shouted out. He was saying his goodbyes and I think he knew he wasn’t going to be saying...,’ Mrs Freeman then broke off.

A keen walker since the age of 18, she told police she had walked through fields with cows in them many times before but said: ‘I had never been in a situation like that before - never. I was absolutely petrified.’

Mrs Freeman ran from the field and flagged down a female motorist who called for an ambulance. She was taken to Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham where she had surgery.

Paramedics found Mr Freeman, a father of two, face down in the field.

He was declared dead at the scene and 
taken to hospital where tests confirmed he had died from multiple 
injuries including fractures to his ribs and shoulders.

Mrs Freeman told the police: 
‘I just keep thinking how could I have left him. How could I have walked
 out of the field and left him but I know he (Roger) wanted me to go and
 get help.’

Prosecutors claim Mr Waterfall, 39, 
knew the bull, named Moonriver Zac Pi, posed a ‘deadly risk’ to walkers 
who used the public footpath.

Known
 as Zac, the 19-month-old Brown Swiss bull had been involved in two 
previous incidents just weeks before the alleged fatal attack on Mr 
Freeman, prosecutor Andrew McGee told the jury yesterday.

Mr
 McGee told the court the bull had charged at three electrical engineers
 who had come to carry out work on the farmland and Waterfall allegedly 
told them that Zac was a ‘nasty and aggressive bull’ that ‘kept walkers 
on their toes’.

During his opening, Mr McGee told the court: ‘As a farmer, Mr McGee had a duty of care to those who used the public footpath. Paul Waterfall had that duty of care and knew his bull posed a real risk of death to people using that path.’

He added that Waterfall, of Underhill Farm, had been ‘grossly neglectful’ in failing to take any steps to prevent that risk.

‘The death was made all the more tragic because it was completely avoidable,’ Mr McGee told the jury.

Waterfall was charged with gross negilgence manslaughter last year following an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive.

It is alleged he breached his duty of care to the public by failing to ensure the bull was safely confined on his land. The trial continues.
