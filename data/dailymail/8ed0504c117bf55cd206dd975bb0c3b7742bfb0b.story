A woman solicitor has claimed that her bullying boss told her he wanted her to stay single and not have babies.

Kate Baker, 33, alleges that she was sacked from law firm Follett Stock because of her gender after she formed a relationship.

She claims in a statement to an employment tribunal that her married boss Chris Lingard ‘on many occasions told me that he did not want me in a relationship or to have babies.

'Bullying': Miss Baker, left, said managing partner Chris Lingard, right, 
would criticise staff for minor offences including not having the radio 
on or having the blinds shut. The company denies the claims

‘I have a text message from Mr 
Lingard’s wife [Fiona Higgins, a business director at Follett Stock] 
which says, “He does say he doesn’t want you in a relationship!!!”’

The tribunal heard she was told she 
was being sacked for making mistakes, but she said: ‘I am of the opinion
that Mr Lingard believed he lost control when I started a relationship 
and this was the true reason for dismissal.’

She also claimed she was expected to 
perform weekend marketing activities for the firm because ‘I was single 
with no children’, unlike her married male colleagues with families.

Her barrister also claimed that Mr 
Lingard used Miss Baker as a ‘distraction’ at meetings with important 
clients because they ‘seemed to like’ her appearance.

Complaint: Kate Bake, 33, claimed she was fired after forming a relationship because her boss could no longer 'control her'

Miss Baker, who earned £45,000 a year,
is claiming sexual harassment, sexual discrimination and unfair 
dismissal. Follett Stock denies the claims.

In her statement to the Exeter 
tribunal judge Christopher Carstairs, Miss Baker outlined a culture of 
alleged bullying by Mr Lingard, who is in his fifties and is managing 
partner of the law firm, which has offices across the West Country and 
London.

Miss Baker, from Budleigh Salterton, 
Devon, claimed that employees were not allowed to talk between the hours
of 9am and 1pm, which the company called ‘golden time’.

She said that in her first two weeks 
at the firm working in its Truro office in Cornwall she saw one woman 
reduced to tears by her boss and claimed Mr Lingard also shouted at 
another woman about swapping desks. She said she had witnessed phone 
conversations where he was aggressive with staff.

She also claimed Mr Lingard regularly 
complained to staff at the Exeter office. She said he criticised them 
for taking lunch, the way in which calls were taken, the sign outside 
the office not being displayed properly, and the radio not being 
switched on, not in the right place or being on the wrong station.

'Critical': The £45,000-a-year lawyer said Mr Lingard would verbally attack staff when visiting Follett Stock's Exeter office (pictured) and reduced one female employee to tears

He also complained about the blinds 
being shut, people leaving at 5pm, and staff looking miserable or 
grumpy, she claimed. She alleged that at a meeting last May Mr Lingard 
told her that her work was ‘s***’. ‘The treatment came out of the blue,’
she said. ‘Mr Lingard awarded me a prize in December 2011 after only 
being at the firm two months (and when I was single).

‘He then took to berating me for 1.5 
hours and attempted to dismiss me by email whilst I was off sick with 
work-related stress and harassment.’

She accused the firm of ‘a culture of bullying, oppression, and lack of good systems and support for the employees’.

Her barrister, James Bax, claimed that
Mr Lingard used Miss Baker as a ‘distraction’ at meetings with key 
clients. He added: ‘She was popular with the chiefs. They were all 
asking about her.’

Guy Hollebon, for Follett Stock, said 
some important clients were impressed with Miss Baker and ‘seemed to 
like you’, and ‘you were a real hit with him’, but denied this was to do
with her gender.

A full hearing will take place at a later date.
