Country Music Hall of Fame singer Mel Tillis is recovering in Nashville after heart surgery over the weekend.

According to a statement from his daughter, Pam Tillis, the 81-year-old singer required a 'routine heart procedure' but is expected to make a full recovery.

'In typical Mel Tillis fashion, he's already cutting up and cracking jokes with the nurses,' Tillis said in a statement.

Four scheduled shows have been canceled due to his surgery.

Tillis became a successful songwriter and singer despite dealing with a stutter, the result of a childhood bout of malaria. He has recorded more than 60 albums.

His hits include Good Woman Blues, Coca Cola Cowboy and Southern Rain. He's written top songs for George Strait, Ray Price, Bobby Bare, Kenny Rogers and many more.

Tillis is also well-known as the TV ad spokesman for the fast-food restaurant chain Whataburger during the 1980s. The fast-food joint is popular throughout the southern U.S.

The original Whataburger consists of a fresh,100 per cent American grilled beef patty, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and diced onions on a toasted five-inch bun.

In 2012, President Obama awarded Tillis the National Medal of Arts For his contributions to country music.
