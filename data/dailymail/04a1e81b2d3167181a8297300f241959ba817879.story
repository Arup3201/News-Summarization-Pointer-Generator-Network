Jailed: Rohan Pershad QC was today jailed for three and a half years for failing to pay £600,000 in VAT

A high-flying barrister who specialises in fraud cases has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison for failing to pay £600,000 in VAT.

Rohan Pershad, 45, who had been working as a Queen’s Counsel, a member of the legal profession’s elite, at London’s 39 Essex Street Chambers, enjoyed a gold-plated pay package.

But Blackfriars Crown Court heard how Pershad stopped paying tax in 1999.

He was found guilty of cheating the public revenue to pocket the cash over a 12-year period after trying to claim that he was 'extremely poor at paperwork'.

The court heard that most barristers are self-employed and legally required to pay their own VAT.

Pershad, whose income rose from £85,000 in 2001 to £346,000 by 2008, was charging VAT on his fees but failed to pass a penny on to HM Revenue & Customs between June 1999 and September 2011.

The money helped to buy a £1.1million home in Virginia Water, Surrey, and a £490,000 home in Somerset.

In sentencing, Judge Aidan Marron QC told Pershad: 'You have brought disgrace on yourself and have aggravated that position by fighting this case and lying in front of a jury.

'It saddens me that I have to deal with you.'

Describing Pershad as having been 'a person of substance to date', the judge added: 'It is sad that you, a successful and otherwise compassionate man, should have sunk to these particular levels.'

Pershad, who specialised in financial disputes, professional negligence and insurance cases, had been guilty of a 'persistent' fraud, the judge said.

Convicted: Pershad, a barrister, stopped paying his own VAT in 1999 - shortly before he moved to the Thirty Nine Essex Street chambers - and then fell off the tax register, meaning he 'disappeared off the VAT radar'

Hearing: Pershad was found guilty of cheating the public revenue at London's Blackfriars Crown Court after the jury was asked to give a majority verdict following more than nine hours of deliberations

During his nine-day trial, jurors heard that most barristers were self-employed and were legally required to pay their own VAT.

Pershad stopped doing so in 1999, shortly before he moved to the Thirty Nine Essex Street chambers.

He then fell off the tax register, 
meaning he 'disappeared off the VAT radar' and was classed as a 'missing
trader' but he continued to work, the court heard.

The prosecution said he knew what his legal responsibilities were.

Denial: Pershad denied the charge against him, claiming he believed Thirty Nine Essex Street paid his VAT

The judge said: 'It is clear to me and was clear 
during the trial that you decided to capitalise on that situation and in
the ensuing 12 years you cheated the revenue of £600,000.

'You willingly and knowingly engaged in persistent and consistent dishonesty.'

Pershad was called to the bar in 1991 and was made QC in 2011. .

Pershad, a father of four children 
aged from 13 to 21 years, is now a 'broken man' who has brought shame on
his family, according to Mukul Chawla QC defending.

Before this case he had been considered 'a man of previous exemplary good character', Mr Chawla noted.

He said: 'He will never live down the
very public humiliation caused by his actions to him but perhaps more 
pertinently caused to his family.

'Mr Pershad is a broken man. He is 
never going to be able to work again in the sphere he had previously 
worked. He is going to have to suffer the shame of going to prison and 
the consequences of that to his family.'

Mr Chawla suggested that Pershad was 
not motivated by finances and was not living the high life with 
expensive cars. His houses had large mortgages, he told the court.

He also suggested that 'in the latter 
period' of the fraud Pershad was 'suffering from a depressive illness 
exacerbated by the breakdown of his marriage'.
