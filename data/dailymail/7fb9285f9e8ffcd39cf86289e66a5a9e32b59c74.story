With a net worth of $72.8billion, business magnate Warren Buffett could indulge in a daily diet of caviar and champagne.

But the billionaire investor shuns luxury food and drink, insisting in an interview this week the only way to stay young and sharp is to eat like a six-year-old.

At the age of 84, the world's second richest man has admitted he drinks at least five cans of Coca-Cola day, enjoys chocolate-chip ice cream for breakfast and will often carry a tube of Potato Stix around with him.

Eat and drink like a six-year-old: Warren Buffett, 84, (pictured in 2010) insists the way he stays young and sharp is by consuming 2,700 calories a day including five cans of Coca-Cola

He told Fortune magazine: 'I'm one quarter Coca-Cola. If I eat 2,700 calories a day, a quarter of that is Coca-Cola. I drink at least five 12-ounce servings. I do it everyday. 

'I have three Cokes during the day and two at night.'

The CEO of Berkshire Hathaway drinks regular Coke at the company's headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska, but at home, he will treat himself to Cherry Coke.

The philanthropist owns $16billion in stock with Coca-Cola and has even considered buying the company who produce the Potato Stix - Utz. 

The reasoning behind his diet is that he believes it is the healthiest way to live.

'I checked the actuarial tables, and the lowest death rate is among six-year-olds,' he said. 'So I decided to eat like a six-year-old. It's the safest course I can take.'

It seems that Buffett's eating habits aren't new. In 2008 he reportedly mulled over an investment in Goldman Sachs while snacking on Cheetos and licorice pastel candies. 

During an interview with the New Yorker in 2012, he ate a hamburger and fries and ordered vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup for dessert. 

He said: 'I like today what I liked fifty years ago... I haven’t acquired a lot of new habits. I was happy when I was in my twenties, and I don’t see a reason to change things.'

In 2009, he revealed his favorite restaurant is Piccolo Pete's in Omaha - a family restaurant which specializes in ribs.

One of the venue's waitresses told CNBC he always finishes with a root beer float and he never orders vegetables. 

Buffett also highlighted his disdain for green food in his biography, The Snowball. He told writer Alice Schroeder: 'Broccoli, asparagus, and Brussels sprouts look to me like Chinese food crawling around on a plate. Cauliflower almost makes me sick. I eat carrots reluctantly. 

'I don't like sweet potatoes. I don't even want to be close to a rhubarb, it makes me retch.' 

Buffett's daily diet was questioned by a New Jersey nutritional dentist in 2009 who urged him to eat healthier foods.

However he defended his choices, telling the Omaha Herald World:  My diet, though far from standard, is somewhat better than usually portrayed. I have a wonderful doctor who nudges me in your direction every time I see him. 

'All in all, I’ve enjoyed remarkably good health — largely because of genes, of course — but also, I think, because I enjoy life so much every day.'  

Staying young: The business magnate, who this year celebrates 50 years as the CEO of Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway, has also admitted he eats ice cream for breakfast and carries round a tube of Potato Stix

A year earlier he said there is a choice between not eating bad food and exercising. He chose exercising because it is the 'lesser of two evils'. 

This year Buffett celebrates 50 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, and it seems his bizarre eating habits haven't affected his appetite to make more money. 

Last week he snatched up Detlev Louis Motorrad-Vertriebs, a German motorcycle equipment manufacturer.  

The deal was worth 400 million euros ($456 million), according to Bloomberg News.

Detlev Louis sells helmets, motorbike clothing and accessories in more than 70 stores in Germany and Austria, as well as online. The company's headquarters will remain in Hamburg, the law firm said. 

'We're probably going to buy a small business in Europe. But I'd love to buy big ones,' he told FOX Business.

Buffett's company typically focuses on acquisitions in the United States.

In the automobile sector, Berkshire Hathaway announced in October it was buying the Van Tuyl Group, the nation's largest privately owned auto dealership and the fifth largest of all dealership groups, for more than $8 billion.

The storied investor also lent $303 million in 2009 to Harley-Davidson to help the stricken US motorcycle maker stay in business during the recession. 

In August, his company's shares reached $200,000 for the first time.
