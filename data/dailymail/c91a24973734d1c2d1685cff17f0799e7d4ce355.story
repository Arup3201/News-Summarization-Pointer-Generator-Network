Maria Sharapova powered into her fourth Australian Open final on Thursday, beating fellow Russian Ekaterina Makarova in straight sets in Melbourne.

Sharapova made it six wins out of six against 10th seed Makarova, winning 6-3, 6-2 in an hour and 27 minutes on Rod Laver Arena, and will face top seed Serena Williams in Saturday's final after she beat teenager Madison Keys in the other semi-final.

Since saving two match points in her second round match with Alexandra Panova, Sharapova has not dropped a set and has lost just 15 games as she seeks to win a sixth grand slam singles title.

The 27-year-old had to save two break points in a 10-minute opening game and promptly broke Makarova's serve to surge into a 4-1 lead.

Makarova briefly threatened a comeback when she broke back to trail 3-4, only to lose her serve again in the next game before Sharapova served out for the set after 48 minutes.

Two more breaks in the first three games of the second set gave Sharapova a commanding lead and the French Open champion was never in danger of letting it go.

'It's so special,' the second seed said in an on-court interview. 'When you start off the tournament you take it a match at a time and it's been kind of a strange road to get to the final, but I am here and really, really happy.

'Playing another Russian and someone who was not necessarily the favourite coming into the match, I knew she would come out and play really well and I think I was ready for that, stood my ground and competed well.'
