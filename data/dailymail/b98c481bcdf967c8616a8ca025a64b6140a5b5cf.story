Amy Robach has opened up about her cancer diagnosis and treatment, saying how she is 'proud' of the 'Frankenstein-like' scars she has as a result of her double mastectomy and lymph node removal.

The Good Morning America correspondent has been off TV ever since an on-air mammogram led to the discovery that she had stage 2 cancer in both of her breasts and her lymph nodes.

'It’s going to be a crappy year, and then I'll be on drugs for probably the next 10 years and there are other issues down the road that we're discussing and we're dealing with. It's about being vigilant and taking care of myself,' she told People Magazine.

Looking great: Amy was first spotted back at ABC studios on Wednesday but she didn't go on air that day

Robach, 40, initially announced that her aggressive route of treatment meant that she would be able to return to the news set on Monday December 2 and while she hasn't been seen on the show yet this week, she was featured in a cover story in People where she told about the arduous recovery process.

After being initially hesitant to have a mammogram during a breast cancer awareness campaign headlined by GMA anchor Robin Roberts, Robach now credits the move with saving her life.

A few weeks later, she was called back to the doctor's office for further testing wherein they discovered that there was a second tumor in the same breast and abnormal cells in the other breast.

'For me, given my age, given the fact that I have young children, I was going to be aggressive,' she told People.

High spirits: Robach said that while the disease has taken an emotional toll on her, she is determined to live to see her young children grow up

'I want to be at my daughter's graduations, their weddings. I want to hold my grandkids. That just becomes your focus.'

The cancer had spread to her lymph nodes as well, and all told she had 13 nodes removed.

'That was the most pain. The breast surgery was painful, but there was nothing like the pain that my arm felt,' she told the magazine.

Due to the location and size of the tumors, Robach's surgeons were able to save her nipples and insert expanders that are placed where the removed breasts once were.

Staying positive: After an on-air mammogram revealed that she had a tumor in one of her breasts, further tests revealed that she had a second tumor, more abnormal cells and the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes

Support: Robach's husband Andrew Shue has been on hand throughout the ordeal, seen here on set when she announced that she had cancer

Driving force: Robach, 40, chose the most aggressive form of treatment- a double mastectomy- because she has young children and much to live for, saying she didn't want the chance of a second bout hanging over her

They will stay in place behind the chest muscle for a few months in an effort to stretch it out before implants are put in during a second surgery.

Even though she remains 'resolute' in her decision to choose the most aggressive form of treatment, it has been an emotionally taxing process.

October 1: In front of 
millions of viewers, a hesitant Robach undergoes her first mammogram as 
part of GMA's Breast Cancer Awareness campaign. Host Robin Roberts, who 
is a breast cancer survivor herself, urged the 40-year-old correspondent
 to have the test.

October 30:
 Robach goes back to the doctor's office for further tests where they 
confirmed that she had two tumors in one breast, abnormal cells in the 
other and 13 cancerous lymph nodes.

November 14:
 She underwent a bilateral mastectomy. They were able to save her 
nipples and doctors inserted expanders behind her chest muscle to 
stretch the area before inserting implants in a few months with a second
 surgery.

November 22: Robach writes an emotional and upbeat memo to ABC staffers saying she is 'excited' to be back at work on December 2.

December 4: Robach is seen entering ABC studios but does not appear on air.

'I'll be honest: there have been a couple of nights where I've sobbed myself to sleep,' she said.

Publicly, she has remained extremely upbeat throughout the process and wrote an email to her colleagues on November 22.

'Physically and emotionally I have been through the ringer, but I am emerging on the other side so much stronger,' she wrote in the memo.

She ended the grateful email with her plans to return: 'As of right now, I plan to head back into the building Monday, December 2nd and I couldn’t be more excited to get back to work.'

That never ended up happening and she has not made an appearance on the air at all this week.

Instead, the GMA staff had to deal with a surprise departure as well as her planned return as it was revealed this weekend that longtime weatherman Sam Champion was leaving the network and headed to The Weather Channel to launch his own flagship morning show.

Much of GMA on Wednesday was dedicated to Champion, with tributes, highlight reels and even the unveiling of a 100-square-foot mosaic of his face made entirely of marshmallows.

ABC press representatives refused to comment on the timing of Amy's return in relation to Sam's sudden departure, only reiterating how well she is doing.
