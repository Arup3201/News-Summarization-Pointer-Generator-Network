The most dangerous killer highways in Britain are revealed today in a chilling new accident road-map of Britain.

The study, which colour-codes roads according to their level of risk, also reveals that drivers are now seven times more likely to crash on an A-road than a motorway.

That risk has risen significantly from a six-fold gap just four years earlier.

Blackspots: The map highlights the most dangerous places to drive in the country

Travel on a single-carriageway is also three times riskier than on a dual carriageway, according to the study.

The report and ‘Risk Map’ reveal that the most dangerous stretch of road in Britain is seven miles of single-carriageway A537 from Macclesfield to Buxton, which has seen 44 fatal and serious crashes between 2007 and 2011.

It is followed by nine miles of the A5012 between the A515 (Pikehall) and the A6 in the East Midlands where four-year fatalities and serious injuries have increased from 18 to 25.

Third place in the A-road accident league table is 13 miles of the A682 near junction 13 of the M65 motorway near Nelson in Yorkshire. Twenty-four people were killed or seriously injured there in each four-year period.

The dangers for drivers on A-roads away from urban areas have been highlighted in a Road Safety Foundation survey which gives a risk rating to every road in the country.

The detailed survey looked at 28,000 miles of British motorways and A-roads outside major urban areas to create a colour-coded ‘Risk Map’ covering every major highway in Britain.

Danger zone: The A537 and A5012, shown on the map in black, are the two most dangerous stretches of road in Britain

The most dangerous high-risk roads are black, medium high risk roads are red, down to the safest, low-risk roads in green.

The report says although these major roads make up just 11 per cent of the road network they carry 56 per cent of all traffic.

It shows that vehicles running off the road account for nearly a third  (30 per cent) of all deaths on these roads while crashes at junctions are the most common accidents leading to serious injury.

The report reveals that for the period 2007-11 the risk to road users was seven times greater on single carriageway A-roads than motorways. In the 2002-2006 period this figure was six-fold.

And while almost one in ten (9 per cent of motorways)  are rated in the ‘low risk’ category, almost all (97 per cent)  of single carriageway A-roads are not.By region, the highest risk of death and serious injury on motorways and A-roads is in the East Midlands, and the lowest in the West Midlands and the poll revealed.

The most improved region is the East of England, with a 30 per cent fall in risk.

More than one in five (21 per cent) of fatal crashes and serious crashes on non-urban A-roads involve pedestrians or cyclists, with one in ten being head-on collisions, and one in 12 (8 per cent) shunts.

Risky: The A537 was ranked the most dangerous road in Britain

The single-lane road is only seven miles long, but sees an average of more than 10 fatal or serious accidents a year.

Some 1,754 people were killed on Britain’s roads in 2012.

But on average, 4 people are killed or seriously injured on each mile of motorway and A roads outside major urban areas each decade.

Motorcyclists make up just 1per cent of traffic but one in five (21per cent) of fatal and serious crashes on Britain’s motorways and A roads.

The report shows 'the dominance of crashes at junctions leading to serious trauma and of death from running off the road.’

But it also highlights improvements which could reduce the carnage including removing roadside hazards such as trees, rigid poles or lighting columns and introducing interactive warning signs, anti-skid surfacing and road studs.

At junctions, crash risks could be reduced by speed limits better suited to the conditions, improved road layout and  signing, and by resurfacing roads with high-friction treatments to reduce skidding.

Risk: The study found that A-road were more dangerous than motorways, and single carriageways more deadly than dual carriageways

The report notes how there has been a ‘remarkable’ 70 per cent  drop in serious crashes –  saving 250 fatal and serious injury crashes– on the ten most improved  roads across Britain.

The most improved road is a seven-mile stretch of the A4128 at High Wycombe, where changes to speed limits, warning signs, and other improvements saw the number of deaths and serious injuries over a four year period drop from 31 to just four - a drop of 87 per cent.

Second-most improved was a six-mile section of the M6 motorway at junction 44 (Carlisle) where deaths and serious injuries over four years dropped from 24 to 5 – or 79 per cent.

The roads were assessed using measures developed by the European Road Assessment Programme (EuroRAP), whose chairman  John Dawson said: ’The British public knows the safety rating of the cars they’re buying but not their roads.

'Our EuroRAP risk maps give an objective view of where people are being killed or seriously injured on a road network and where their crash risk is greatest.’

The ‘Risk Map’ uses the most up-to-date crash and traffic data from the national road injury and accidents database provided by the Department for Transport.

It includes all crashes resulting in fatal or serious injuries during the data periods 2002-2006 and 2007-2011 inclusive.

1,754 people were killed on Britain’s roads in 2012.

11,457 were killed on British roads in the 5 year survey period 2007-2011, compared with 16,533 in the previous 5 years - a drop of 31 per cent.

The 28,0000-mile network of motorways and A roads outside major urban areas analysed in this report represents just 11 per cent of Britain’s road length - but carries 56 per cent of traffic  and more than half (51 per cent) of all deaths.

Motorways and dual carriageways have seen the greatest improvement with a 24 per cent reduction in the survey. The improvement for single carriageways is 18per cent.

On average, four people are killed or seriously injured on each mile of motorway and A-roads outside major urban areas each decade.In the 2007-2011 data period, single carriageway A-roads are seven times more risky than motorways. In the 2002-2006 period this figure was six.

Travel on single carriageways is three times more risky than dual carriageways.

62 per cent of fatal and serious crashes occur on single carriageway A-roads, 12 per cent on duals, 15 per cent on mixed single/dual and 11 per cent on motorways.

The most common crashes on motorways and A-roads leading to death are run-offs (30 per cent). 

The most common crashes leading to either death or serious injury occur at junctions (36 per cent).

21 per cent of fatal and serious crashes involved pedestrians or cyclists; 10 per cent were head-ons  and 8 per cent shunts.

22 per cent of fatal crashes involved pedestrians or cyclists; 19 per cent were head-ons and 6 per cent shunts.

99 per cent of motorways are rated in the ‘low risk’ category; 97 per cent of single carriageways are not.

The British economy loses more than 2 per cent of GDP in road crashes.

British road users pay 1 per cent of GDP on motor insurance.

In the last five years, Britain suffered serious injury costs of £1.9 billion on motorways, £8.4 billion on primary A-roads and £5.9billion on non-primary A-roads.

Motorways account for 36 per cent of travel on the network analysed, 18 per cent on duals and 32 per cent on singles.

Motorcyclists make up just 1 per cent of traffic but 21 per cent of fatal and serious crashes on Britain’s motorways and A-roads.
