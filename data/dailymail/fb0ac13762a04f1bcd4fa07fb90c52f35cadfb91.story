A man who has worked on two of the world’s most luxurious cruise liners is being investigated by police over allegations he indecently assaulted child passengers.

It is claimed the crew member carried out the sexual assaults over the past five years on Cunard’s flagship the Queen Mary 2 and its sister vessel Queen Elizabeth.

Over that period, the ships have been packed with tens of thousands of British families enjoying luxury voyages across the Atlantic, Caribbean, Mediterranean and the Baltic.

Luxury: Trips on the 151,000-ton Queen Mary 2 (above), which was launched in 2004, can cost up to £120,000

Prestigious: The £400million Queen Elizabeth, launched in late 2010, charges as much as £5,000 for a 13-night Mediterranean cruise

Detectives started the investigation after a tip-off thought to be from the parents of one of the children involved, all of whom live in the UK.

Police in Wiltshire, where the unnamed man lives, have contacted parents in various parts of the UK whom they want to interview.

Cunard – part of the Carnival cruise company that owns the sunken Italian ship Costa Concordia – has also asked the children’s  charity, the NSPCC, to speak to  worried parents who may require counselling and advice.

Nobody has been arrested or charged over the allegations.

Another world: The QM2 even had its own planetarium

But police sources confirmed to The Mail on Sunday last night that the ex-cruise worker – who left the company before the police probe began six months ago – has been interviewed by Wiltshire CID.

Detectives are understood to have examined photographic and computer equipment at the man’s home.

The investigation, which began last summer, has taken so long because of the delicate nature of the allegations and the fact they involve young children.

Cunard bosses, headed by the  company’s president and managing director Peter Shanks, have launched their own inquiry into the allegations, which officials said had ‘deeply shocked’ them.

Company managers are understood to be reviewing Cunard’s strict vetting procedures, which are carried out on every applicant and include criminal-record checks.

Cunard refused to say what role the former cruise worker had  carried out on its ships, but he is known to have been a low-ranking employee who had regular, close contact with passengers on board.

The 151,000-ton Queen Mary 2, which entered service in 2004 and is as long as 41 double-decker buses, employs 1,253 crew and accommodates 2,620 passengers.

Passengers pay between £1,200 and nearly £4,000 a head for a seven-day transatlantic cruise from Southampton to New York. Round-the-world trips are available with a top price of about £120,000.

Stars who have travelled on the QM2 include The Who’s Roger Daltrey, Dame Shirley Bassey, John Cleese, Carrie Fisher and Jane  Seymour.

Right royal approval: Both vessels were launched to great fanfare by The Queen

Queen Elizabeth, the newest of the Cunard fleet, launched in late 2010, is much smaller than the QM2, at 90,900 tons.

It can take 2,068 passengers and has 1,005 crew. The Elizabeth boasts luxury cabins and ornate lounges.

The cost of a 13-night Mediterranean cruise, excluding return flights, is between £1,700 and £5,000, depending on the grade of cabin required.

Famous passengers on the Queen Elizabeth have included Sir David Frost.

Both the Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mary 2 were launched in a blaze of publicity by the Queen but the man under investigation has never met her, according to Cunard.

A Wiltshire Police spokeswoman said last night: ‘We can confirm we are investigating historical allegations of child abuse by an employee of Cunard cruise liners. Inquiries continue. The employee no longer works for the company.’

A Cunard spokesman said: ‘We are deeply shocked by these allegations as the safety and wellbeing of our customers is of paramount importance to us.

‘A thorough police investigation is under way which we are supporting and co-operating with fully.’
