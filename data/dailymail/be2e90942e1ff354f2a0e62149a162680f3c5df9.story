In the past year, 545 tons of red cabbage have been bought in Britain

Sales of red cabbage are booming as growing numbers of shoppers get wise to its health benefits.

In the past year, 545 tons have been bought in Britain – up nearly 50 per cent on the previous 12 months.

And the amount consumers spent on red cabbage soared by 26.4 per cent to £590,000, according to trade magazine The Grocer.

The variety is one of the most nutritious cabbages – containing ten times more vitamin A and twice as much iron as the traditional green type.

British supplier Produce World said that although red cabbage sales peaked at Christmas, they remain strong.

Other varieties are also selling well, with Sweetheart up by 29.9 in volume on the past year, figures from market analyst Kantar Worldpanel reveal.

Produce World agricultural director Andrew Burgess said that cabbages offer high ‘nutritional value and versatility’.

He believes more consumers are coming round to the high nutritional value of the vegetable and are eating it all-year-round and not just at Christmas.

'Cabbages have been part of a staple diet of many UK households for years due to its nutritional value and versatility as a vegetable,' he said.

'Luckily the UK has the ideal growing conditions to grow the best cabbages in the world, with Produce World providing enough for nearly half a million UK consumers every year.'

Cabbages are showing strong volume growth generally, including new varieties such as Pointed Sweetheart and old favourites like White cabbage and Savoy - which posted 15.2% and 7.2% volume growth respectively.
