Angry: Ambulance driver Andy Thomson was fined and had three points put on his licence, after being caught driving at 84mph on the A1 in Scotland on his way to deliver a child's liver for an emergency transplant operation in Leeds

An ambulance driver has been fined and had points put on his licence - after speeding to save a child’s life.

Andy Thomson was taking a child’s liver for an emergency transplant operation in Leeds when he was caught doing 84mph on the A1 in Scotland.

The father-of-three had expected to be let off because of his job but he was given a £60 fine and three points on his licence.

He had been driving a private ambulance - but, despite working for the NHS, he says police did not recognise his as an emergency vehicle.

And now the driver has spoken of his outrage at the decision of Haddington Sheriff Court in East Lothian.

Andy, 46, from Blyth, Northumberland, said: 'I think it’s an absolute disgrace.

'We’re now going to have to switch off our blue lights and go through that stretch at 70mph even if it is an emergency.

'That is going to cost somebody their life if there’s too much delay on one of these organs,' said Andy, who was driving a private ambulance for Lifeline Medical Transport Services.

His journey took him to St James’s Hospital in Leeds just in time for a seriously ill child’s liver transplant to go ahead on October 8, 2011.

'At the end of the day, somebody’s life depends on this organ and for me to be delayed in anyway and for the hospital turn around and say "sorry, you’re too late", would be awful,' he said.

The fine was the first time in Andy’s four-year career as a driver that he has been prosecuted for speeding.

He said: 'Lifeline was contracted by the Freeman Hospital to carry out work for the NHS.

'I drive all over the country taking organs between hospitals and I’ve never once had a problem, apart from in East Lothian.

'Last March, I was on the very same road taking an organ and was clocked [at] 108mph and no action was taken against me, so I don’t know why police have decided to come down on me now.'

After picking up the liver at Edinburgh’s Royal Hospital for Sick Children, cameras caught Andy at 7.06am on the southbound A1 at Gladsmuir.

Lifeline disputed the fine and asked police for a Section 87 exemption for the offence - which the NHS Scottish Ambulance Service uses to avoid fees.

But the company were told private ambulances don’t fall under Lothian and Borders Police’s definition of an emergency vehicle.

Andy said: 'I was aware of the speed camera flashing as I passed but wasn’t really that concerned as I knew my speed was anything but excessive for what I was doing.

'I’m really annoyed by how they apply the law so discriminately in Lothian and the Borders.

'It’s as if there’s one law for the Scottish Ambulance Service and another for us, yet we both work for the NHS.

'This ruling needs to change and be brought to the public’s attention, as it’s just wrong.'

A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said: 'Lothian and Borders Police Road Policing Unit work closely with the NHS to establish the authenticity and credibility of any agency claiming to be carrying out work on their behalf when caught speeding.

'The decision to prosecute a driver for any motoring offence is made by the Procurator Fiscal.'
