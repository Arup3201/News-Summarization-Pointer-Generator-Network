Mrs Doubtfire star Lisa Jakub has revealed the words of wisdom that the late actor Robin Williams imparted to her during their time together on the set of the 1993 hit movie.  

Lisa, 36, was just 14-years-old when she starred in the big screen comedy and went on to retire at age 22 - however she says that the advice and knowledge Robin shared with her during filming for the movie has stayed with her ever since.

'Robin would go off onto one of his brilliant tangents and I would stand there looking panicked,' she told Today.com. 'I learned pretty quickly that wasn't going to work and I needed to go with the flow and not just wait for my turn to talk.

Throwback: Lisa Jakub, pictured in 1993 at the premiere of Mrs Doubtfire, was discovered in a farmer's market at age 4, but decided to leave acting behind as an adult, choosing to retire at the age of 22

Family ties: During their time on set together Lisa (L) and her young co-stars formed a close bond with comedian Robin Williams, who played the title role of Mrs Doubtfire 

'Those things are helpful for an actor and in real life - you can assume you know exactly how it's always going to go, and you find that's not what always happens.' 

But even with his amazing ability to improvise, Lisa still says Robin had a quiet side.

She admits that she was often asked if it was 'exhausting' to be around the comedy star all the time, because of his seemingly over-the-top personality, however she insists that, behind the scenes, he was actually 'a little shy'.

'As a massive introvert, I found that so reassuring, that it was OK to be a little quiet and just listen sometimes,' she added.

Growing up in Hollywood: The actress, pictured with her co-stars in 1993, also appeared in 1991 hit Rambling Rose with Robert Duvall, 1993's Matinee with John Goodman, and 1997's The Beautician and the Beast

Robin also showed her that not everyone who works in Hollywood was as self-centered as she thought.

When  the actress was upset about being expelled from high school due to frequent absences during the filming of Mrs Doubtfire, Robin immediately jumped to her defense - and went out of his way in order to help her rectify the situation.

Revealing that the star 'showed up at her trailer' with a letter he had written to the principal, Lisa explained that Robin was unlike so many other people she had met in the industry, adding that he always 'had her back' and made her feel as though she had his support. 

The former actress-turned-writer mentioned that same heart-warming incident in a personal blog post she penned shortly after the actor's death in August last year, noting how his actions had helped her to change her already-cynical view of Hollywood - and people working within the industry.

'I was only 14, but I had already seen that I was in an industry that was full of back-stabbing. And it was entirely clear that Robin had my back,' she said in the blog post.

Lisa added during her Today interview that Robin ensured she knew that he cared about her future, too, and warned her and her young castmates about making the same mistakes with drugs that he did.

'I remember thinking that was so impressive, that he was so honest and he was making himself so vulnerable and that was so brave to me, that he was able to talk to us about these things in an attempt to save us from making the same mistakes,' she explained.

Since retiring from the acting industry almost 15 years ago, Lisa has gone on to pen a memoir, titled You Look Like That Girl, which is due out on June 15, about what life was like growing up in the spotlight.
