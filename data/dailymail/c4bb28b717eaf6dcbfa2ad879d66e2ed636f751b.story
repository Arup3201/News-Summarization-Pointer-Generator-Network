Parents of students at an Arizona high school are upset that the school's yearbook includes two pages students who either have young children or are expecting them.

The Mesa High yearbook includes photos of students with their children under the headline 'I'm working a double shift.'

Mixed emotions: Teen parents are seen with their children and describing their struggles

'These parents are too busy making time, grades, money and plans for their children, whom they love more than anything else in the world,' the yearbook spread reads, for 'high school drama.'

Parent Kathee Merkley told The Arizona Republic a picture which showed a pregnant student's belly hugged upset her.

'When you look at the pages at first, you think it is of a child development class,' she said. 'But then if you look closer, you see the photo of the boy hugging the belly. I think that was unnecessary.'

Mesa High Schools spokeswoman Helen Hollands told MailOnline there had been 'a few' calls from parents, but did not have an exact number. She said she was at the school yesterday morning for an hour and that there were no calls.

Student reactions: A spokesperson for the school district said student reactions to the yearbook, the cover of which is seen here, 'run the gamut'

Students' reactions 'run the gamut - some felt the content was inappropriate while others were fine with it,' she said.

Phone and email requests for comment to Principal James Souder from MailOnline were not immediately returned.

However, the school said in a statement to 12 News that its young parents are 'fully supported in their academic endeavors.'

'The subject matter presented on several pages in the student life section of the Mesa High School yearbook reflect choices made outside the school environment,' it says. 'The students depicted are fully supported in their academic endeavors by the school and district.'Â
