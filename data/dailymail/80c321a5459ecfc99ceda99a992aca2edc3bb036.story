A couple at the centre of an international five-year manhunt over an alleged £1million NHS fraud have been arrested in Cyprus.

Deborah Hancox, 44, and John Leigh, 53, are charged with eight counts of fraud and conspiracy to defraud the Greater Manchester Deanery, a teaching organisation.

They allegedly moved to Cyprus after 
police interviews in 2008. The pair were only able to be arrested when 
they moved from the Turkish-controlled north side of the island to 
Republic of Cyprus in the south.

Arrested: The pair were taken in by Cypriot police and appeared in court in Manchester on Tuesday

Unlike the north side, which has no extradition treaty with the UK, the Republic of Cyprus does, and allowed Hancox and Leigh to be taken in.

The couple stepped over the 
border to the Republic of Cyprus at the end of last year where they were
 taken into custody on a European Arrest Warrant.

The couple were flown back to Britain by Cypriot police and appeared before Manchester Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday.

Ms Sarah Johnson, from the CPS, said with a little research the couple would have discovered northern Cyprus to be a ‘non-convention’ country, and so has no extradition treaty with the UK.

Appeal on Crimewatch: The pair allegedly moved to Cyprus in 2008

A Crimewatch appeal to help trace the pair was made by the National Crime Agency in October.

They were wanted in a joint investigation by Greater Manchester Police and the NHS’s counter fraud unit, NHS Protect. Leigh was employed by the NHS as an IT manager from 2000 until 2009.

He was questioned by police over claims he had interests in three IT companies used to supply equipment, services and goods to the NHS.

The couple are suspected of being involved in a fraud that led to the NHS being defrauded out of more than £1million.

The case has been transferred to Manchester Crown Court for a preliminary hearing later this month.

Criminals have been able to take shelter in northern Cyprus for years thanks to diplomatic tensions over the area.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, dozens of criminals began fleeing there to take advantage of the fact that the Turkish-controlled part of the island has no extradition treaty with the UK.

The situation came about because the UK government does not recognise Turkey’s claim to the land. The Turkish government has offered to sign a treaty with the UK, but so far the Government has refused to avoid offending Cyprus or Greece.

Fears have been raised that the situation means the area could become the equivalent of Spain's Costa de Sol in the 1970s and 1980s, where criminals would often go to escape extradition.

Authorities in northern Cyprus have said they will co-operate with UK police. This, however, has not stopped the island being a problem.

Last year the Serious Organised Crime Agency released a ‘most wanted’ list of nine wanted men who were believed to be in Cyprus, in the hope that it would help them be brought to justice.

Police could only take them in after they strayed from northern Cyprus - which has no extradition treaty - to the Republic of Cyprus, which does
