EastEnders actress Linda Henry is due to stand trial over allegations she hurled racially aggravated abuse during a row outside a Jamie Oliver restaurant in London. 

The 51-year-old, who plays barmaid Shirley Carter in the BBC soap, faces trial after pleading not guilty to a charge of racially aggravated harassment at Bexley Magistrates' Court.

The charge is in connection with an incident outside Jamie's Italian in Greenwich on September 14.

Court case: Actress Linda Henry, 51, denies allegations she hurled racial abuse outside a London restaurant

Alleged dispute: The star is accused of hurling abuse during a row outside Jamie's Italian in Greenwich

She is accused of using threatening or abusive words which was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, and the alleged offence was racially aggravated, a court official said. 

Henry, who has appeared in the BBC One soap since 2006, has vowed to fight 'tooth and nail' to clear her name when the case goes to court next year. 

She reportedly chose not to attend the court hearing in south London on Wednesday, and instead pleaded not guilty via her lawyer.

A spokesman for the star told MailOnline today: 'She will be defending the allegation.' 

A source added to The Sun: 'Linda is horrified at the accusation and intends to fight it tooth and nail.

'Those close to her know the truth and the type of person she is.

'She has never been in trouble before.'

Henry, whose case is being heard under her married name Virilis, is due to stand trial on February 11 next year.

The manager of the restaurant has insisted none of his staff were involved in the alleged dispute.  

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Linda Valiris, 51, an actress, of south-east London, was summonsed to appear at Bexley Magistrates' Court on November 26 charged with a racially aggravated public order offence.

'The next court appearance is scheduled to take place at the same court on February 11.

'This follows an incident in Greenwich on September 14.' 

A BBC spokesman said the broadcaster will not be commenting on the allegations faced by Henry.

Aside from the court hearing, the actress has had a big month on EastEnders as her alter-ego Shirley returned to screens for the first time since Phil Mitchell's wedding.

The Carter family is set to be rocked forever by a series of shock revelations including the news that Shirley is in fact Mick's (Danny Dyer) mother.

Shirley had vanished after shooting Phil on his big day, but was eventually discovered hiding in an old family caravan.

Brought up in Peckham, south east London, Henry started acting as a teenager and studied at leading London drama school The Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. 

Before appearing in EastEnders, Henry was best known for her role in ITV prison drama Bad Girls, where she played Yvonne Atkins - G Wing's 'top dog' who was jailed for hiring a hit-man to kill a business rival of her gangster husband. She appeared in the role between 1999 and 2003.

She has also appeared in crime dramas The Bill, Touching Evil, Cracker, A Touch Of Frost and Trial & Retribution, as well as comedy series Birds of a Feather.

Mother-of-one Henry, who married husband Stavros Virilis in 1992, has been nominated for several awards for her portrayal of Shirley, who the actress has described as a 'strong proud woman'.

The BBC is yet to comment on whether Henry will be suspended from the show. However, it is understood that she will continue filming EastEnders until her trial date.

Earlier this year Ricky Norwood, who plays was Arthur 'Fatboy' Chubb, was suspended from the soap for two months after an online video emerged of him apparently smoking cannabis.

In May it emerged that Khali Best, known to viewers as mechanic Dexter Hartman, had been suspended for three months over a dispute with a London taxi driver, who said he was punched in the face and his vehicle doors kicked. Best accepted a police caution for common assault and criminal damage.

It was announced last week that he will be leaving the show in the run up to Christmas.
