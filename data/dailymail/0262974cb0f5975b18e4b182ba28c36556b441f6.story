Most people have surely pondered what they would save if their house was burning down. A disabled Georgia man went back into a burning home this week to retrieve his beer.

Walter Serpit's house was on fire Thursday, but that did not deter him from going back in for his most prized possession, a case of Bud Light.

Six adults and two young children made it out, but Mr Serpit - who walks with a cane - narrowly escaped death as he ambled back in for his beloved lager.

'I told them to get the kids out and everything, and me myself, being an alcoholic, I was trying to get my beer out,' Mr Serpit, Of Columbus, told WTVM.

I went back into the house like a dummy and the door shut on me because this back draft was about to kill me,' he added.

Remarkably, he made his way to the fridge, grabbed the beer and escaped certain fiery doom.

News footage showed Mr Serpit's case of beer on the ground while he spoke to the media.

No one was injured as a reult of the blaze and it is not clear in what condition the house remains, based on multiple local reports.

The Red Cross was on the scene to provide assistance to those affected by the blaze, WTVM noted.

A new water heater is suspected in the blaze, but the investigation is still ongoing.
