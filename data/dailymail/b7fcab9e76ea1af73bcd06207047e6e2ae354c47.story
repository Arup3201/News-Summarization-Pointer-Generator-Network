Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano has admitted that Sergio Aguero could make his life a nightmare as Manchester City chase down a 2-0 Champions League deficit in the Nou Camp tomorrow night.

City arrived in Spain this afternoon with a mountain to climb after losing their last sixteen first leg clash at the Etihad Stadium three weeks ago.

But former Liverpool player Mascherano told a press conference at Barcelona’s training ground this lunchtime that his international team mate Aguero could change things round in tomorrow’s second leg if he is given the chance.

Mascherano said: 'I know Sergio well and in my opinion he is one of the best five strikers in the world.

'He is a great player and if he is given space he can be a nightmare to play against.

'We
 will try and give him as little space as possible as the last thing we 
want is for him to be comfortable. We need to make things uncomfortable 
for him.

'I think we will 
see a very attacking Manchester City team. They always attack but the 
result from the first leg means that they will throw even more players 
forward.

'We will try to dominate the possession. That’s the only way to play against really good teams.'

Few
 people give City much chance of overturning the result from the first 
leg, even if Barcelona are getting it in the neck from their critics in 
Spain after a weekend defeat at Valladolid saw the slip to third place 
in La Liga.

One questioner 
asked Mascherano how Barcelona had gone 'from the fairy house to the 
monster house' in recent weeks while another accused the players of not 
training hard enough.

He 
said: 'Tomorrow is a different thing. It is the Champions League and the
 team has to go out there on the pitch and play as we usually do.

'I
 believe in what I do and what I see and, at the end of the day, I don’t
 know who said we aren’t training hard enough because we are the ones 
who are really training and working hard.

'This team and group, we have made this profession dignified. I can look straight into your eyes and say we do things well.

Something to smile about: Neymar was in high spirits as the Barca stars were put through their paces

'We
 cannot play as we did against Valladolid, but we can get back to 
winning and our best form and tomorrow is a good chance to do that.

'Right now, it is March and we have two months to end the season by doing something special.

'Now is the time to press the accelerator and achieve our objectives.'

Barcelona
 coach Gerardo Martino has come under great pressure in recent days with
 people questioning his right to manage the club.

Martino said: 'All I can do is be strong and be powerful.

'We
 have lots of things to play for. We are still in three competitions and
 I have to be strong and try to get us back to how we were playing when 
we went to Manchester City.

'I need to be a leader. If I’m not then I don’t deserve to be a manager.'
