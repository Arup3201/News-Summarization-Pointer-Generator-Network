Mike Ashley is poised to tighten his grip on Rangers with fresh emergency funding amid claims Ibrox will not be used as security.

Sports Direct, Ashley's sportswear firm, are preparing to lend the stricken club more cash, with a reported £10million on the table.

The Three Bear shareholding group, consisting of bus tycoon Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor, have made an alternative offer of £5million.

The future of the Scottish giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems

The lodging by Sports Direct of advanced notices of security against Ibrox and Murray Park last week has raised expectations, however, that the Rangers board will opt for a new loan from one of Ashley's companies.

Rangers refused to offer any comment on the Ibrox claims last night.

But sceptical fans groups have called on the club's board to provide proof the iconic stadium is safe after the news leaked out on Sky, rather than a legally binding stock market announcement.

Chris Graham of the Union of Fans told Sportsmail: 'They previously confirmed they are looking at Ibrox as a security. If you want to put that to bed you either put out another stock exchange announcement offering a categoric assurance.

'Or you get Mike Ashley to remove the advance notices from the Land Register.

'They have done neither of those things.

'I'm sure this information is coming from somebody close to the board – but that doesn't mean they are telling the truth.'

The news Sports Direct had taken an advance notice over Ibrox triggered a furious backlash.

Rangers Fans Fighting Fund backed a legal bid to halt the move while former director Dave King has called a General Meeting aimed at ousting the current board.

Ashley already holds Edmiston House and the Albion car park as security against previous loans worth £3million. 

Caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has added to the turmoil by resigning for 'personal reasons'

If the Rangers board now honour promises made last May not to use Ibrox as security they are likely to offer the club's Auchenhowie training ground as the safeguard to a lender instead.

'The original terms of Ashley's offer to lend more money clearly included Ibrox and Murray Park in the advance notices,' added Graham.

'You don't do that unless you are about to grant security – because it stops you granting security to anyone else for 35 days.

'If the board have backed off from that then either Ashley is receiving a different type of security or more Rangers retail.

'Whoever lends money at the moment is going to get Murray Park – because there is nothing else.'
