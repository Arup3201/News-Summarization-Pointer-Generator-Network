A defiant Pakistani schoolgirl has spoken publicly for the first time since she was shot in the head by the Taliban for campaigning for women's rights, and declared she wants every child to be educated.

Malala Yousafzai, 15, under went five hours of surgery in the UK on the weekend, when surgeons attached a titanium plate to bridge a gap in her shattered skull and fitted a cochlea implant to help her recover the hearing in her left ear.

The teenager had been targeted in her 
home country of Pakistan for bravely speaking out against the regime and
calling for greater women's rights.

Recovering: Malala Yousafzai speaks from her hospital bed following pioneering surgery on the weekend

Inspirational: The teenager talks to Dr May Manji, critical care consultant at Queen Elizabeth Hopsital

Defiant: The 15-year-old women's rights campaigner said she wants to continue with her 'mission'

She was flown to the UK after a Taliban assassin barged onto her school bus and fired at her from point blank range.

A short video clip of Malala speaking for the first time since the shooting was released today.

In the clip, which was filmed days before the operation, Malala said: 'Today
you can see that I am alive. I can speak, I can see you, I can see 
everyone and I am getting better day by day.

'It's just because of the 
prayers of people. Because all people - men, women, children - all of them have prayed for me.

'And because of all these prayers God has given me this new life, a second life. And I want to serve.

'I want to serve the people. I want 
every girl, every child, to be educated. For that reason, we have 
organised the Malala Fund.'

A second video of Malala sat up in her hospital bed following the operation was also released today.

Grateful: The schoolgirl showed incredible strength as she spoke publicly about her ordeal

Speaking in English, she said: 'I'm feeling alright and I'm happy both the operations are successful.

'Now they have removed everything from me and I can also walk a little bit and I can talk and I'm feeling better and it doesn't seem like I had a big operation.

'I think everything is fine, it's better. I think it will just get better very soon and there will be no problem. My mission is the same to help people and I will do that.

'If I try to speak about my whole treatment, it started in Pakistan and they did a very successful and a very good operation.

'And God gave me new life because of the prayers of people and the talent of doctors.

'Here in Birmingham they did the operation of my nerves so after four or five months the left side of my face was working.

'They took a lot of care of me and I think I'm really inspired from the doctors and nurses, they are like my mother and father. I will get fully recovered very soon.'

Brave: Malala Yousafzai speaks for the first time since being shot in the head by the Taliban for protesting

Determined: The 15-year-old, who had surgery in the UK, said she wanted every child to be educated

The inspirational videos were released by bosses at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, which treats soldiers shot or blown up on the battle field.

The schoolgirl escaped death by a matter of inches when she was shot on October 9 last year - as the bullet entered just above her left eye and ran along her jaw, 'grazing her brain'.

Doctors in Pakistan removed the bullet before Malala was flown to the UK, where she is likely to secure permanent residence.

Her father Ziauddin was given the job of education attache at the Pakistani consulate in Brimingham earlier this year.

Malala had been readmitted for the surgery after leaving the hospital to recuperate with father Ziauddin, 42, mother Toorpekai, 40, and brothers Khushal, 12, and eight-year-old Atul, at a safe house in the West Midlands.

Recovery: Malala's surgery has been described by a Queen Elizabeth Hospital spokeswoman as a success

Faith: The teenager said she is 'getting better day by day' thanks to the prayers of all people

A hospital spokeswoman said the operation was a 'success', and added: 'Her condition is described as stable and her medical team are very pleased with the progress she has made so far. She is awake and talking to staff and her family.'

He said she was aware of her high profile and Taliban threats to her, but added: 'She's determined to speak for her cause.'

The new Malala Fund has been set up to support the determined teenager's long-running efforts for children's right to education across the world.

The fund has been established by non-governmental organisation Vital Voices.

Alyse Nelson, Vital Voices President and CEO said: 'We stand with Malala and girls around the globe who are boldly speaking out as advocates for education and equality.

'When girls move forward, they take their communities forward too.'
