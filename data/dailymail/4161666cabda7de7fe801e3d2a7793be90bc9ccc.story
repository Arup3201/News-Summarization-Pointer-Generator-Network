Global management company IMG reportedly dumped Bernard Tomic on Tuesday

Embattled Australian tennis star Bernard Tomic has reportedly been dumped by global management company IMG.

News emerged on Tuesday that the agency had terminated its lucrative contract with the 21-year-old before it was due to expire.

Tomic first signed with IMG as a 12-year-old, spawning marketing deals potentially worth millions of dollars with the likes of Nike, Yonex, Optus and Qantas.

While the one-time Wimbledon quarter-finalist has fallen outside the top 100, it's understood Tomic's off-court behaviour was behind the split, according to the US-based Sports Business Journal and tennisworldusa.org.

IMG's Australian-based director of tennis, Brian Cooney, has not responded to AAP's calls for comment.

Tomic has been involved in a series of off court dramas, including clocking up a string of driving offences in his yellow Ferrari F430 Spider, worth more than $400,000, and losing his license in January 2013 for speeding.

He was doing 78kmph in a 60 kilometre zone and received a standard $220 fine and three demerit points, but due to his poor driving record had his license suspended, reported Fox Sports.

On Australia Day in 2012, he was pulled over three times while driving a high powered bright orange BMW worth $150,000, and received two $300 fines for the same offence, reported The Daily Telegraph.

It was reported he was first pulled over after allegedly revving at pedestrians and he was then pulled over a second time in the afternoon.

The third time police tried to pull him over that day, Tomic had refused to stop but was followed home, resulting in a standoff when the tennis player refusing to speak to police until his lawyer arrived.

The tennis player had an exemption to drive the sports car on the condition it was for activities related to tennis, including going to and from training.

In December 2012, he was given a 12-month one-point good-behaviour licence due to a series of hooning and driving offences across the Gold Coast.

Tomic's Ferrarri Spider is worth more than half a million dollars and bears the number plate 'SinCity', the name of a Gold Coast nightclub run by a friend of Tomic's family

The controversial player was photographed receiving a lap dance from young female dancers at the Sin City nightclub on the Gold Coast in November last year.

The nightclub is owned by Jamie Pickering, a family friend of the tennis player and is a favourite hang-out for Tomic, who held his 21st birthday party there last year.

Tomic has copped criticism for partying instead of training, as his antics have coincided with a drop in form for the player.

Among his critics are former tennis great Pat Rafter and Tomic's former coach Neil Guiney.

Rafter banned Tomic from a Davis Cup tie in Taiwan last year because of attitude problems, reported The Daily Telegraph.

During a press conference following his first-round French Open defeat in May, Tomic lashed out at a reporter who questioned whether his father was suitable to return as his coach after a 12 month suspension for assaulting Tomic's practice partner, Thomas Drouet.

The revelation follows Tomic's round-one victory at the Claro Open Colombia in Bogota on Tuesday (AEST).

The Australian wildcard beat Uzbekistsan's Farrukh Dustov 6-3 6-3 for his first win on hard courts since January, when he reached the final of the Sydney International.

Tomic, who was sidelined for two months after the Australian Open to have double hip surgery, fired 10 aces against the 140th-ranked Dustov and converted three of his four break-point chances.

He next faces either 2013 finalist Alejandro Falla or Japan's Tatsuma Ito.
