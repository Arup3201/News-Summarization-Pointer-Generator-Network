A 15-year-old boy will appear in court charged with a sex assault on a pensioner

A teenage boy is due to appear in court today charged with a sex attack on a pensioner in her home.

The 15-year-old was knocking on doors in the area when he was let into her home, in Rochdale on Sunday afternoon, it is claimed.

He allegedly exposed himself to the woman, who is in her 70s, indecently assaulting her.

Greater Manchester Police were called at around 12.30pm to reports of the sex attack on the elderly woman.

When they arrived at the sheltered housing they discovered the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been trying a number of doors in the area.

Officers arrested the 15-year-old from Norden and charged him with sexual assault.

He will appear at Bury Magistrates' Court today.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'Officers arrived at the scene and established the offender was let into 
the home of an elderly woman.

'While there he indecently assaulted her in
the bedroom.

'The victim is being supported by specially-trained officers.'

The sheltered housing development where the woman was attacked is comprised of 59 flats and a number of bungalows.

Residents live independently on site, with the support of resident management staff.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
