Marouane Fellaini insists that Manchester United's priority this season is to make a swift return to the Champions League.

The former Premier League champions failed to qualify for Europe last term for the first time since 1995 and are currently competing with the likes of Arsenal, Southampton, Tottenham and Liverpool for a top four finish. 

Although manager Louis van Gaal has not ruled out a late challenge for the title, Fellaini believes those hopes should be reserved for next season.

The Belgium international insists a top four finish is the priority this season

Speaking to Goal.com at the launch of New Balance Football, the Belgium international said: 'It is important because Manchester United have to play in the Champions League, and we have the quality for that. 

'We will see if we can win the league in 2015-16, but we have the FA Cup and Champions League qualification to aim for. Then we will see next season.

Fellaini was heavily criticised during his first season at Old Trafford after arriving as former Everton manager David Moyes' first signing.

The Scot was eventually sacked after a dismal set of results saw United finish seventh in the table, having won the league the previous year under Sir Alex Ferguson. 

'Last season was a bad one for us,' admitted Fellaini. 'Both for me and everyone at Manchester United it was disappointing.

'It was worse for me because I was the first signing for David Moyes, so I received all the criticism.

'I felt bad because I've known Moyes for a long time. I know he is a great man.

Fellaini insists he will play anywhere that manager Louis van Gaal asks of him

The 27-year-old has forced himself into the reckoning under Van Gaal, although he has largely been used as an attacking alternative as opposed to his preferred defensive midfielder role. 

“I’m a midfielder. I like to play a bit more defensive, but it’s up the manager to choose. If you put me up front you know why you’re doing it. 

'Wherever he tells me to play, that's where I play. I always play to win a game so I can't say to the manager that I can't play where he wants me.
