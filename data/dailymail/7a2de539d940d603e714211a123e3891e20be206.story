For a split-second, Nick Kyrgios, the tradesman’s son and great hope of Australian tennis, was out of Wimbledon to a double fault.

Then Hawkeye was clapped into life and from the tightest of margins came a second chance for a wildcard teenager who survived nine match points to spring one of the biggest shocks of these Championships.

On the other side of the net, Richard Gasquet, the 13th  seed, was shaking his head in disbelief. He knows a thing or two about teenage hype but — much like this match, in which he took a two-set lead and then lost 3-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-5, 10-8 — his has been a story of talent not quite fulfilled.

It’s anyone’s guess how far a prodigy can go in tennis, but already Kyrgios is racking up the endorsements.

His first came from Andy Murray earlier this month,  when he labelled the 19-year-old ‘the next big Aussie star’.

And Gasquet weighed in on Thursday night, saying: ‘He can be a top-five player and he can win a Grand Slam.’

The signs so far are more than encouraging for a player who remains outside the top 100 at 144, but who has made astonishing progress since  he decided five years ago to shelve thoughts of a career in basketball in favour of a sport he disliked when first introduced to it.

‘My mum brought me down to the local tennis centre in Canberra when I was seven and I wasn’t keen,’ he explained. ‘I didn’t want to play it. But I guess it wasn’t a bad choice.’

He has since acquired the junior title at the Australian Open,  the junior doubles title here and  yesterday took his first serious scalp from the elite.

He did it with the fuel of a singing and dancing contingent of  Australians, a backing he encouraged with fist pumps and screams.

When Kyrgios saved the first of those nine match points in the fourth set, he beat his chest and pointed at the noisy 10 or so fans in green and gold shirts.  

When he successfully challenged the fifth-set call made against his second serve at 6-5 Gasquet, advantage Gasquet, those Australians in the crowd responded with a rendition of the theme tune to the Rocky films.

Day to remember: Kyrgios plays a return to Gasquet during the clash

He was spared by  millimetres in that instance, and then survived a further three match points in a wonderful finale. ‘We all know his potential,’ said Gasquet. In the ambitious mind of Kyrgios, the plan is for that potential to take him to world No 1, as he was in the juniors. ‘My goal is to become the best,’ he said. ‘It’s a long journey. This was my biggest career win.’

And a win which he followed immediately with a trip to the gym and thoughts of the 20-year-old Jiri Vesely, whom he faces in the next round after his fellow  wildcard knocked out Gael  Monfils, the 24th seed.

The winner is likely to face Rafael Nadal for a fairytale opportunity in the fourth round.Meanwhile, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga emerged intact from a fourth straight day of play as he survived a major scare against Sam Querrey.

Longest match: It took Kyrgios 233 minutes to defeat the Frenchman

Much like his first-round match against Jurgen Melzer, the 14th seed’s clash went to five sets and was split across two days.

He resumed his second-round tie at two sets apiece and 9-9 with  Querrey serving, but the Frenchman battled through to win 4-6, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 14-12.

Milos Raonic, a Canadian with a huge serve, is also through after blitzing Jack Sock in straight sets. Raonic, who has offered only one, unconverted break point in two matches, beat the American 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.
