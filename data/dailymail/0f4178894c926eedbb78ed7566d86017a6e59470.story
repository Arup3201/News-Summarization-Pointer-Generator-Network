A removal lorry today arrived outside the home of former footballer Paul Gascoigne in Poole, Dorset, as photos emerged of him being turned away from an off-licence.

Gascoigne - known as 'Gazza' - hired removal men to help pack up his belongings - just one day before his lease on the luxury top-floor apartment runs out.

It is understood that the former England star was told by his landlord several weeks ago that he would not have his lease renewed after a string of disturbances.

A man comes to meet Gascoigne at the front of the shop, where he was then refused entry.

Photographs show the man from the shop, believed to be a member of staff, following Gascoigne out into the street, where appear to have an argument.

Gascoigne then visited an estate agents with a mystery brunette, who smiled happily as he put his arm around her.

The move comes just a day after photos emerged of a gaunt Gascoigne was pictured cradling a chicken at a pub in Hampshire.

He had been drinking with locals at the Starr Inn, in East Tytherley, while dressed in a fishing waistcoat.

It
 was reported that the 47-year-old enjoyed a pint of beer while he 
chatted to regulars at the pub, as he cradled a chicken on Saturday.

several weeks ago that he would not have his lease on the penthouse flat

Gascoigne
 - known as 'Gazza' - got removal men in to help pack up his belongings 
from his penthouse apartment the day before his lease on the luxury 
top-floor apartment ran out

In 
each, he is wearing a just an open fishing waistcoat on his top half and
 on his lower half, a pair of jeans which appear to be several sizes too
 large for his small frame. His shoelaces appear to have become untied.

It
 is not clear where the chicken came from, but the pub is close to 
several popular fishing lakes which could explain his unusual attire.

Gascoigne's love of fishing is well documented.

The
 photos, published in The Sun, emerged after it was revealed Gascoigne 
had been arrested for allegedly throwing a brick at a van.

The 
former Newcastle ace was reportedly arrested on suspicion of criminal 
damage on Wednesday outside his home in Sandbanks. It is believed it 
followed an altercation with a photographer.

Police
 arrested him at his penthouse flat shortly before 2pm after being 
called out to a disturbance. Officers arrived at the block of flats on 
the shores of Poole Harbour in one van and two cars.

A gaunt Gascoigne was seen playing football with the landlord's son using a giant inflatable ball,

Several remained outside the premises 
while others went inside the flats. They were then seen closing the 
balcony doors to his flat. A few moments later he was led into the back 
of the police van.

The 
troubled 47-year-old was wearing a dressing gown with the hood pulled 
up. He was driven to Poole Police Station where he spent several hours 
being questioned.

Other saddening photographs of him carrying - and dropping - a four-pack of Stella Artois lager cans also emerged this week.

The
 alcohol was brought for him by a friend who gave it to him in a Co-Op 
plastic bag covered by a Marks & Spencer carrier yesterday near his 
home in Sandbanks, Dorset, according to a witness.

Gascoigne
 then dropped the cans on the pavement before picking them up again, and
 also took a pack of cigarettes and a lighter from a wall which had 
reportedly been left there for him.

Earlier in
 the day he was seen with the four-pack of lager. Gascoigne was released on
 bail and must return to the police station next month.

A
 Dorset Police spokesman said: ‘At 1.42pm officers attended a 
disturbance (and) a 47-year-old man was arrested for criminal damage. He
 was released on bail until October pending further enquiries.’

In 2010, he called a 
radio station to inform them he was off to search for fugitive Raoul 
Moat while he was hiding from police officers, taking with him a fishing
 rod, lager and some chicken.

He later admitted he did not realise 
that the former bouncer had shot a police officer in the face and 
admitted he feels 'guilty' about the incident.

Moat
 died following a stand-off with police. Gascoigne said in a radio 
interview at the time: 'He is willing to give in now. I just want to 
give him some therapy and say "come on Moaty, it's Gazza."'

Spotted: Paul Gascoigne was seen emerging from a Dorset home and then walking along with the bag of cans

On the floor: Gascoigne dropped the cans (circled) on the pavement in Sandbanks before picking them up again

He
 later told the Daily Express: 'I thought I could take him fishing 
because stuff like that has worked on me. But his situation was 
different from mine.'

Earlier this week, it was reported that Gascoigne had to be helped to his feet after he
 lost control of a golf buggy he was driving and crashed into a ditch.

The
 former England footballer, who was admitted to hospital a fortnight ago
 after an alcoholic relapse, was driving the 15mph buggy when it swerved
 off the course and into a grassy ditch at a golf course in Bournemouth.

Delivery: The alcohol was bought for him by a friend - wearing a pink dressing gown and flip flops - who gave it to him in a Co-Op plastic bag covered by a Marks & Spencer carrier

Dressing gown: He also took a pack of cigarettes from a wall which had reportedly been left there for him

Fallen football star Paul Gascoigne has reportedly been arrested for throwing a brick at a van - days after he was seen in a pub garden wearing fishing gear and holding a chicken. He is pictured being escorted from his Bournemouth home by police to an ambulance two weeks ago

He
 was said to be dazed but unhurt after the incident, which happened at 
the Playgolf course in the south coast resort at 10.30am on Sunday.

In a TV documentary shown last 
September, Gascoigne described the pain of fearing he might start 
drinking again, despite knowing it could kill him.

He was first sent to rehab in 1998 by 
Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson, having been found unconscious after 
drinking 32 shots of whisky.

Since
 then he has fought a public battle against both drink and drugs, 
particularly after leaving the world of professional football a decade 
ago.

Last year his friends 
DJ Chris Evans and ex-England cricketer Ronnie Irani paid for Gascoigne 
to attend a rehab clinic in Arizona.

And
 for the past four years, Gascoigne has been living in Poole, where he 
is an occasional patient at the nearby Providence Project rehabilitation
 centre.

The arrest comes after reports that Gascoigne - 'Gazza' -  had been drinking with locals at the Star Inn, in East Tytherley, Hampshire, while dressed in a fishing waistcoat and holding a chicken

Hunter Davies, who co-wrote the former star's 2004 autobiography, said: 'He doesn’t even like alcohol. He hates the taste of it.

'I’ve been with him when he’s poured it into flower pots, because he finds it so revolting. But then he will get depressed, and just want to get obliterated.'

Despite his demons, he is still remembered fondly by fans of the clubs he played for - including Newcastle United, Lazio, Rangers, Everton and Middlesbrough - for his brilliance on the pitch.

He starred in midfield for Terry Venables' England side during Euro 96, where his virtuoso goal against Scotland was topped off with an equally memorable celebration.

Six years earlier he was seen crying on the pitch after being booked in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany. The booking making him unable to play in the final.
