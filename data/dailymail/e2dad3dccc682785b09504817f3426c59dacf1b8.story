A heavily-pregnant woman critically injured in a car crash woke up three days later - to find her baby boy had been born.

Wei Liu, 30, and her boyfriend Geng Yu, 24, were on their way home in a taxi when it was struck by a Golf car.

Wei, who was eight months pregnant, suffered serious injuries in the car crash in Ancoats, Manchester, and was rushed to hospital in a critical condition.

Reunited: Wei Liu woke up three days after being seriously injured in a car crash and met her baby boy Lucas for the very first time. The mother and baby are now both recovering well at home

Together again: Doctors carried out an emergency caesarian on Wei Liu after the car crash - but warned her boyfriend Geng Yu, pictured left, there was a chance neither would survive

Doctors at Manchester Royal Infirmary warned her boyfriend he may have to decide between saving the life of his partner or that of their baby. 

They performed an emergency caesarean in the A&E room to deliver baby Lucas a month early before operating on Wei and placing her in an induced coma.

Wei had suffered a severed artery above her heart, fractured ribs which had pierced her liver and a shattered pelvis, leaving doctors uncertain if she would survive her injuries.

But she made a remarkably recovery and woke up three days later to meet her baby boy for the first time.

Bonding: Wei Liu, pictured giving baby Lucas a kiss, said she feels incredibly lucky that both her and her baby have survived

And after 40 days in hospital Wei, a shop assistant at Selfridges, was allowed home.

She said: 'The last thing I remember is the taxi turning across Great Ancoats Street as I was on the phone to a friend.

'The
next thing, I woke up with people all around me. I had something in my 
mouth so I couldn’t speak but I realised my belly had gone smaller and 
my baby was gone.

'Because I couldn’t talk I kept just touching my belly and heard people saying "your baby is fine".

'I found out later the doctors had told my boyfriend to be prepared because they hadn’t seen that many people survive things like this before.

Injuries: Wei Liu suffered a severed artery above her heart, fractured ribs which pierced her liver, a fractured cheekbone, broken foot and shattered pelvis, in the smash but, incredibly, both her and her baby survived

'I think at one point he was asked if he
would rather save me or the baby. My heart had stopped beating for a 
few seconds and they thought I was dead.

'A few days later I woke up again and Geng was there in a wheelchair. That was when I got to hold Lucas for the first time.

'I still can’t work out how I survived. I just feel so lucky to be alive and that Lucas is okay.'

On the mend: Wei Liu still needs a wheelchair to get around because of the injuries to her pelvis and she is also still suffering from memory loss

Wei also suffered a fractured cheekbone, broken foot and a huge cut across her head, which needed 48 stitches.

She is now back at her Ancoats home and is recovering well, but remains in a wheelchair and has memory problems.

Geng was also injured in the crash on May 3, needing surgery for a punctured lung, broken ribs and injuries to his feet.

He said: 'I didn’t know what to do when they said I might have to choose between Wei and the baby, I was in so much pain.

'I
just didn’t want to go to the operating theatre myself until I heard 
the baby had been born - when I heard him cry I started crying too. I am
devastated I missed him being born but so happy he and Wei are alive.'

Intensive care registrar Dr Tuheen Huda was part of a team of doctors fighting to save both Wei and her son.

Dr Huda said: 'Their survival is entirely testament to the fact that we have had a really good major trauma system set up.

'In
Wei’s case we checked her baby and found its heart rate was dropping, 
and found a major blood vessel coming from her heart had been cut in 
two. Her and her baby’s lives really were in serious danger.

'But
after surgery, within a few days she was ready to be awakened. Her 
mother had come over from China and I took her off the ventilator and 
introduced them, then about an hour later we brought her baby in so she 
could see him for the first time. It was incredibly emotional.'

The driver of the Golf, a 19-year-old man, was
arrested by police at the scene of the crash on suspicion of causing 
serious injury by dangerous driving and other driving offences. He 
remains on police bail until July 8.
