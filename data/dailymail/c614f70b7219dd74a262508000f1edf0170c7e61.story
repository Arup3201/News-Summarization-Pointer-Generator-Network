A woman fired from her teaching job because of a menacing, abusive ex-husband's behavior is back in the news.

But this time it's good news. Thanks to her courage leading her to take her story to television, Carie Charlesworth has been offered a fresh start with a brand new teaching position.

Sometime after her story aired on San Diego local news, Charlesworth was contacted by a concerned viewer.

The woman, who did not want to release 
her name, runs a private school in Los Angeles and offered to take 
Charlesworth on as a new employee.

And Charlesworth, who thought all the
publicity would spell the end of her career as a teacher, was overcome 
by emotion.

'It's good to know that people generally care about other people,' a teary-eyed Charlesworth told San Diego's NBC 7.

Though Charlesworth said she would be willing to relocate for the job, she and the good Samaritan still have much to discuss.

Nonetheless, the offer itself was enough to bring hope back to a woman whose life was so recently torn apart.

A victim of domestic violence has been fired from her job as a sixth-grade teacher in California because the private school have deemed it too dangerous to keep employing her.

Darker days: Second-grade teacher Carie Charlesworth says the Diocese that runs her school called her a liability and fired her because of her menacing ex-husband

Carie Charlesworth recently received a
letter from the Diocese of San Diego informing her that her 
ex-husband’s ‘threatening and menacing behavior’ was too much of a 
concern, and they could no longer allow her to work at Holy Trinity 
School in El Cajon.

The
shocking decision not only impacted Charlesworth’s career and ability
to earn, but her four children who also attended the school have also 
been barred from returning.

‘They’ve taken away my ability to care for my kids,’ she said. ‘It’s not like I can go out and find a teaching job anywhere.’

The incident dates back to January when Charlesworth was forced to call police after what she called ‘a very bad weekend with him.’ 

The next day, she spoke to her principal to warn them about her ex-husband, Martin Charlesworth.

Not long afterwards he showed up at the school parking lot - forcing the entire school to go into lockdown.

Since then Charlesworth and her four children have not returned to the school. Her ex-husband was jailed on two felony charges, but is due to be released later this month.

A letter was sent to parents at the time of the incident explaining what happened and explaining that Charlesworth and her children had been put on ‘indefinite leave.’

In a letter from the Diocese who runs Holy Trinity School, Charlesworth was informed that she and her four kids were barred because her ex-husband was 'too dangerous'

Three months later Charlesworth received the letter informing her that she was fired – a move which despite 14 years working in the Diocese means she is now barred from working at any of its area schools.

The letter from the Diocese explained that Charlesworth was being fired because of her husband’s ‘twenty-plus year history of violence, abuse, and harassment of people - mostly women.’

‘We know from the most recent incident involving you and Mrs. Wright (the principal) while you were still physically at Holy Trinity School, that the temporary restraining order in effect were not a deterrent to him,’ stated the letter.

‘Although we understand he is currently incarcerated, we have no way of knowing how long or short a time he will actually serve and we understand from court files that he may be released as early as next fall.

'In the interest of the safety of the students, faculty and parents at Holy Trinity School, we simply cannot allow you to return to work there, or, unfortunately, at any other school in the Diocese.’

Charlesworth, who says she feels like she’s being treated like a criminal, has hired a lawyer and intends to sue the school.

But NBC reports that several parents at the school said the district did the right thing in a no-win situation because they feared for the safety of their own children. There was even a movement to  'pull kids out of the school' if Charlesworth returned.

'I mean that’s why women of domestic violence don’t come forward, because they’re afraid of the way people are going to see them, view them, perceive them, treat them,' said Charlesworth.
