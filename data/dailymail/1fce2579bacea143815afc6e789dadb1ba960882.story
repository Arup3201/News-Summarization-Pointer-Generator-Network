Aston Villa's Fabian Delph admits he 'went missing for a few years' but says he has progressed and would love a new contract with the Midlands club.

The 24-year-old was touted as a future England international during his days at Leeds but as the years wore on, Delph's admirers dwindled.

Last season was something of a renaissance for the Bradford-born midfielder who made 34 appearances - his highest figures since joining The Villans in 2009.

Delph said: 'I feel like I went missing for a few years and that's not something I'm happy with.

'The owner (Randy Lerner) has been brilliant. He's always believed in me and every time I've seen him he's been nothing but positive.

'I'd love to sign a new deal and am ready to talk but it's not up to me so we'll have to see.'

Aston Villa are half way through their mini pre-season tour of the US. They beat FC Dallas 2-0 last night and the Paul Lambert was full of praise for his players.

He said: 'I'm really delighted. I have been since they (the players) came back. They have come back in really good shape.

'They did well at Mansfield and again here against a team who have played several games in their own division. I'd like to get through these games with everyone fit. But it is nice to win'

Villa's remaining pre-season games are against Houston Dynamo (July 27), Chesterfield (July 30), Gronigen (August 2) and Parma (August 9).
