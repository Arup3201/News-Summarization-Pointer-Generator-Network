The Army recently published regulations stating that 'Negro' is an acceptable term for describing black personnel.

The policy published as recently as October 22 said that Negro is an OK term for, 'a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.'

CNN reported that the regulations also said that 'Haitian' is an acceptable term.

An Army spokesman named Lt. Col. S. Justin Platt came forward after CNN brought the terminology to light on Wednesday.

He said, 'The racial definitions in AR600-20 para. 6-2 are outdated, currently under review, and will be updated shortly.'

'The Army takes pride in sustaining a culture where all personnel are treated with dignity and respect and not discriminated against based on race, color, religion, gender and national origin,' he added.

An Army official defended the document to CNN by saying that the word Negro must have been added to it because a man chose to 'self-report' that he liked being called by that word.

A Military officer specializing in personnel issues for the Defence Department told CNN that excuse 'the dumbest thing I have ever heard.'

He also told CNN that the Pentagon doesn't use that word in any of its far-reaching collection of demographic data.
