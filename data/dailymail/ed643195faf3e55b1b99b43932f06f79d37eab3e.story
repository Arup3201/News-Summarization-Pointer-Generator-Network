England's trip to Estonia might not be one to grab the headlines but, personally speaking, it certainly brings back memories.

This is only the second time England have been to Tallinn but the first occasion we were there, on June 6, 2007 for a Euro 2008 qualifier, I realised that I could no longer carry on representing my country. That was the match that pushed me into international retirement.

A fortnight earlier, I had just played in my second Champions League final in three years. That game against AC Milan came at the end of a season when my form had been consistently good, so I felt I had solid claims to be considered for a starting role for England.

On the Friday before we headed out to Estonia, Wembley hosted its first England senior game since its redevelopment, against Brazil.

Rio Ferdinand was injured and I thought I'd take his place alongside John Terry but I played right back and wasn't overly thrilled with my performance.

I had hoped it was just an experiment but Ledley King retained his place next to Terry for the game in the Le Coq Arena, which England comfortably won 3-0. I stayed on the bench and when Steve McClaren made that decision, I knew the final nail had been put in the coffin for me, internationally.

It was in Tallinn that I knew the time had come to concentrate solely on Liverpool.

THIS WEEK I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO… Immersing myself in Roy Keane's book

I've just got my copy of The Second Half and although I am only a couple of chapters into it, it has not disappointed.

People have their own opinions of Roy and some would be fearful of him, given how outspoken he can be. I have always judged people how I find them and I can honestly say that I have never found a fault in him.

During Euro 2012, I worked with him on ITV as a pundit. As you can imagine, he was never afraid to say what he thought but, away from the cameras, he was always good company and he enjoys talking about football. This latest book has generated a lot of headlines but I don't think it should be forgotten what a magnificent player Roy was.

I would have loved to have been on the same team as him and it must have been a joy for centre backs to have him standing in front, for the cover he would provide.

Do not underestimate, however, the skill he had. I noticed Wayne Rooney said in a recent interview that he regarded Roy as the best passer of the ball he played with and I could see no reason to argue with that claim as his distribution was magnificent.

He had a fabulous career and I know I’m going to enjoy reading about it.
