A boy who was born with his skull fused together has had an operation to break his head apart and then pieced back together - just like a jigsaw.

While most babies are born with gaps in the skull which allow the brain to grow - Archie Outlaw, four, from Haverhill, Suffolk, was born with Craniosynostosis, which fuses the skull together before birth.

The little boy underwent a gruelling five hour life-threatening operation - which could have also caused brain damage - to reshape his skull and piece it back together.

Mother Kelly, 32, said: 'When me and my husband, Stephen, realised that Archie would need such a serious operation we were petrified.

'But with his skull fused together, his brain wouldn't have been able to grow and he was already experiencing some problems with his hearing and speech, it could have also have affected his mobility and eye-sight.

'He has a big zig-zag scar across his scalp, but that's now covered in hair. He's such a little fighter.

'People would often stare and point at his head when we were out in public which was really hurtful.

'I started dressing him in hats, in a bid to hide the shape of his head.

'Looking back I wish I hadn't, I'm proud of my brave boy and his rare condition.'

Ms Outlaw said that it was not until her son was five months old that she realised there was something 'not quite right'.

She said: 'I was a first time mum, I had no idea what was "normal."

Ms Outlaw said that it was not until her son was five months old that she realised there was something 'not quite right'

'I was just told he had a 'flat head' but with some time on his tummy it should change back so I trusted the experts.

'Archie had been suffering from a few breathing difficulties too and it wasn't until a hospital admission when he was seven months old that we found out what was actually wrong with him.

'A doctor there asked us what type of Craniosynostosis Archie had. We didn't have a clue what she was talking about.

'We were then referred to Great Ormond hospital in London when Archie was a year old and he was given a CT scan as well as hearing, eye sight and development tests when we finally got the answers we'd been desperately searching for.'

Archie was also diagnosed with Frontometaphyseal Dysplasia which only affects approximately 35 people worldwide.

The genetic syndrome causes abnormalities in skeleton development as well kidneys and bladder heart defects and problems with breathing.

Archie had to wait until he was three-and-a-half before he underwent the operation at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford to correct his skull.

Kelly added: 'Some doctors view Craniosynostosis as cosmetic because some children don't need to operation but in reality it can be fatal.

'Archie finally had the surgery when doctors realised his breathing was worsening, they had to do surgery to stabilise his airway with a tracheostomy then he had his cranio surgery.

'He is finally discovering what a four year old is all about.

'Archie is constantly smiling and such a happy sweet caring boy.

The family said Archie has made a remarkable recovery from his operation and his hair has since grown over his zig-zag scars

'Since Archie's skull surgery and windpipe surgery life has become physical easier for us and are now spending more time together as a family.

There is a risk that Archie's skull may re fuse again. If this was to happen it would mean more surgery.

Gill Ruff, the group administrator for Headlines, the craniofacial support group said: 'Normally when a child is born the skull is made of individual plates. If the plates have prematurely fused, the brain will grow but may make the skull shape different.

'The child could have brain damage or pressure on the brain if left untreated.'

After the end of the year old single suture children will not normally face anymore surgery.

If the child has a syndrome they will receive treatment at various times up to their teenage years.

Ms Outlaw has gone on to help other parents by setting up a supportive Facebook page called Cranio Ribbons.
