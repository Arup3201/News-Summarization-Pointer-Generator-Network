A financial advisor who swindled £5million from his elderly victims has been ordered to pay back just £1.

Terry Warrington persuaded dozens of vulnerable people to part with their life savings, after spending 25 years running a successful investment company with his business partner.

But the pensioners were left penniless when their investments were lost, and Warrington was jailed for four-and-a-half years in January 2014 after admitting fraudulent trading, theft and operating while unregulated.

At a proceeds of crime hearing hearing at Preston Crown Court, Warrington, who has now declared himself bankrupt, was made to pay back just £1, despite benefiting from more than £5million.

An elderly couple from Morecambe, Lancashire, who lost over £100,000 after investing on the advice of Warrington, said: 'That money was to help the family and give us something to fall back on and that worries us more than anything.'

A couple from Heysham, Lancashire, who invested £30,000 following advice from Warrington, said: 'Terry came to our house three times and told us he was having a bit of trouble raising the cash, but he would pay it out of his own pocket. We are still waiting.'

For almost 25 years, Warrington and his colleague Malcolm Barber ran an investment company offering fixed bonds and loans to hundreds of investors.

But in April 2007, the scam was uncovered and the business partners were jailed following a lengthy investigation.

They were both banned from being company directors for five years.

An investigation will now be launched into all Malcolm Barber's assets, to determine how to meet the £5.7million payback.

All the money eventually recouped will be paid back proportionately to the victims.

A further hearing will take place in September once investigators have analysed Barber's assets.

A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'Should Terry Warrington come into any money in the future, that will be confiscated.'
