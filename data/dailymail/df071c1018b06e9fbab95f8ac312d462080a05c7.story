'Vile': Jeanne Wilding, 64, arriving at Leeds Crown Court today to face charges of seven counts of breaching a five-year ASBO she was given in 2008

A 'vile' pensioner breached her ASBO when she allegedly terrorised staff at two different charity shops, a jury was told today.

Jeanne Wilding, 64, breached the order when she entered the premises of Emmaus and St Vincents charity shops in Leeds and caused 'harassment, alarm or distress', Leeds Crown Court heard.

Chloe Fairley, prosecuting, told how throughout last year Wilding was going into the shops and shouting at staff, refusing to leave or stay away when asked, and trying to leave without paying for items.

In some cases her behaviour was so 'alarming and distressing to staff' that police were called. On one occasion, when she refused to leave, she was led away in handcuffs.

Wilding faces seven counts of breaching an ASBO she was given in 2008.

One count relates to David Kirk, a member of staff who had been working for Emmaus, a charity providing accommodation and work for the homeless, for about three years.

Mr Kirk had moved out from the charity housing and into a flat beside Wilding. The pair went on holiday together, and she allegedly said she would find him work.

The jury were told that Wilding 'was constantly making David work for free' and if he refused to do some work she launched into 'a torrent of abuse'.

They heard that she 'flew into a rage' when he refused to do some work he was not comfortable with.

'The Crown say the behaviour towards him caused him harassment, alarm and distress,' said Miss Fairley.

On another occasion in July 2012, this time at the the St Vincents shop, Wilding allegedly used another person to hand a letter to a staff member - which when opened was seen to be from Wilding and was derogatory.

Just weeks after this Wilding again entered the St Vincents store and caused alarm to staff, and she was later arrested by police.

'These are two entirely independent stores and the prosecution say the defendant has deliberately ignored bans in the stores and engaged in behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm, or distress to staff in the stores,' Miss Fairley told the jury.

Giving evidence today the general 
manager of Emmaus, Alison Ward, said the homeless people who work there 
live above the shop, which sells items such as furniture, clothes and 
books and has a coffee shop.

Ms Ward told the jury that she has known Wilding for about 18 months. On May 4 she had a run-in with her regarding a letter the charity was to write to the bank on behalf of Mr Kirk, as he was leaving their accommodation.

Due to a delay the letter wasn’t written right away, something the court heard that David accepted.

But when Mr Kirk returned with 
Wilding, she put her foot in the door to get into Ms Ward’s office, 
allegedly calling her and her colleague bullies.

Ms Ward said that Wilding 'called me and Katrina bullies, said it was unacceptable of me not to do the letter for Dave, we had ruined his life.'

After getting Wilding to leave the office Alison said they spoke to Dave and wrote out the letter for him but still felt intimidated by Wilding’s manner.

'I didn’t take her words to heart, I had known Dave, I’ve known him along time but it wasn’t nice to be called a bully,' Ms Ward said.

'It is very difficult to have a conversation with someone who is continually shouting over the top of you.

'Standing so close to you and acting vile, [that] is the only word I can use.'

On May 25, the day after Wilding had been issued with a harassment order by police banning her from entering any of the Emmaus branches, she was back in the building.

The court heard that she was refused service from the coffee shop and then tried to leave the premises without paying for something, but Ms Ward stopped her and was shouted at for her troubles.

'You have no idea, she is just very intimidating,' said Ms Ward.

The police were called again and found Wilding in the coffee shop having a cup of tea. She raised her voice and told them 'it was an absolute waste of police time' but they put her in handcuffs.

'She told them she was a little old lady and it wasn’t right,' said Ms Ward. 'She was making a scene and being loud.'

The court heard that before leaving, Wilding shouted at Alison, telling her it was all her fault and she 'was the subject of a serious complaint'.

'I think it is the first time we’ve had to have somebody arrested from the shop in the six years I’ve been there,' added Ms Ward

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
