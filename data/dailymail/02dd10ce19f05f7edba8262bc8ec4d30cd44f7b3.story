After scoring in Chelsea's FA Cup win against Watford, Brazilian playmaker Willian treated his family to a trip to Stamford Bridge on Monday.

The 26-year-old scored the opener for the Blues' in their victory over the Championship outfit on Sunday, as they bounced back from their 5-3 defeat at the hands of London rivals Tottenham on New Year's Day.

After coming on a second-half substitute for Andre Schurrle it took Willian just 13 minutes to get off the mark, as Jose Mourinho's men eventually ran out 3-0 winners.

A day later the Blues midfielder posted a picture of him and his family on his Instagram account after another trip to Chelsea's west London home.

A message alongside the picture said: 'Family going away today, since I miss love y'all bjao'.

Next up for the Blues is a trip to Swansea in the Premier League as they look to steal a march on title rivals Manchester City - with alphabetical order the only difference between the two sides so far.
