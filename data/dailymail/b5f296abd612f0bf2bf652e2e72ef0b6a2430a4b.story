People diagnosed with ADHD are twice as likely to die prematurely than people without the disorder, according to new research.

Those diagnosed as adults were more than four times as likely to die early compared with those without ADHD at the same age - while children diagnosed before the age of six years had around double the risk of early death.

ADHD is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.

It's the UK's most common behavioural disorder and an estimated two to five per cent of schoolchildren and young people are affected by it.

The increased risk of early death was driven by deaths from unnatural causes, more than half of which were caused by accidents.

The study, published in The Lancet, is the first to shed light on the role of ADHD in premature death.

Dr Soren Dalsgaard of Aarhus University in Denmark said: 'Our findings emphasise the importance diagnosing ADHD early, especially in girls and women, and treating any co-existing antisocial and substance use disorders.

'It is however important to emphasise that although the relative risk of premature death is increased in ADHD, the absolute risk is low.'

The large nationwide study followed nearly two million people from the Danish national registers, including more than 32,000 people with ADHD, from their first birthday to 2013, for a maximum of 32 years.

The causes of premature death were then assessed to compare individuals with and without ADHD and found 107 with ADHD died.

Previous research showed individuals with ADHD are more likely to have a range of co-existing disorders including oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and substance use disorders. 

Commenting on the study, Professor of psychiatry Dr Stephen Faraone at The State University of New York Upstate Medical University said: 'For too long, the validity of ADHD as a medical disorder has been challenged.

'Policy makers should take heed of these data and allocate a fair share of health care and research resources to people with ADHD.

'For clinicians, early identification and treatment should become the rule rather than the exception.

'Although talk of premature death will worry parents and patients, they can seek solace in the knowledge that the absolute risk for premature death is low and that this and other risks can be greatly reduced with evidenced-based treatments for the disorder.' 

The findings also reveal that girls and women with ADHD have a higher relative risk of premature death compared with boys and men with ADHD.
