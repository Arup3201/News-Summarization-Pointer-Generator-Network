The Queen was all smiles today as she took part in the historic Garter Day service at Windsor Castle on the day the Duke of Edinburgh was discharged from hospital.

She joined members of her family and senior figures for the annual ceremony of pomp and pageantry staged in the grounds of Windsor Castle.

Philip is convalescing at the Castle after he left the London Clinic this morning following exploratory abdominal surgery more than a week ago.

The Duke will spend around two months recovering from the surgery before resuming his royal duties in the autumn.

The service was preceded by the procession of members of the Order of the Garter - one of the highlights of the royal season.

In a touching change with tradition, 
the Queen, who would normally walk with Philip, was flanked by the 
Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge.

With Charles on her right and William on her left, she smiled as she walked towards St George’s chapel for the service.

Wearing their blue velvet robes and 
black velvet hats with white plumes of heron and ostrich feather, the 
Royal Garter Knights walked past the thousands of spectators gathered in
 the grounds of the castle.

Other members of the monarchy who are
 also Royal Knights or Ladies of the Order and took part in the 
procession were the Princess Royal, Duke of York, and the Earl of 
Wessex.

The Duchess of Cornwall and Countess 
of Wessex watched the procession from the vantage point of the Galilee 
Porch at St George’s Chapel as their partners processed past.

Founded by King Edward III in 1348, 
the Order  of the Garter is the last remaining honour to be given at the
 discretion of the sovereign and is awarded to those who have 
contributed to national life or have served the Sovereign personally.

Every
 knight is required to display a banner of his arms in St George's 
Chapel at Windsor, together with a helmet, crest and sword and an 
enamelled stallplate and carries the letters KG after their name for 
life.

The splendour of the Queen's robe could be seen in its entirety as she leaves the chapel today

William was 
officially invested in the order in 2008 in a private ceremony at the 
castle Throne Room, accompanied by his father and grandfather.

The
 knights today enjoyed an elaborate luncheon in the castle's Waterloo 
Chamber before making their way to the chapel for the religious service 
of installation for new members.

More
 than 7,000 specially-invited members of the public cheered on the 
party, who were proceeded by trumpeters and elaborately costumed heralds
 as well as the 14 Officers of Arms, each bearing ancient titles such as
 the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and the Maltravers Herald Extraordinary.

The Queen travelled from the ceremony in a carriage with Camilla and Charles with two liveried footman at the rear

The Queen was the first to leave the service and she was joined in her carriage by Charles and Camilla.

They drove past squadrons of the Household Cavalry's Life Guards and Blues and Royals who lined the route.

Following soon behind was Edward and Sophie, sitting opposite William and Andrew in their carriage.

The Countess wore a hat perched on the side of her head and she hung onto the brim as the wind began to pick up.

William was photographed appearing to stick his tongue out as he went past.

The crowds cheered as they royals passed and they were soon joined in the Castle by members of the congregation for afternoon tea.

The Order welcomed a new Garter Knight, Air Chief Marshal the Right Honourable Graham Eric who was Invested by the Queen in the Garter Throne Room and installed as a Knight during the service in St. George's Chapel today

Crowds gathered outside Windsor castle to watch the members of the Order of the Garter walk by in procession

The Queen is sovereign of the order and a number of other British and foreign royals are additional knights of the order.

New appointments are announced on St George’s Day but the chivalric and 
installation ceremonies take place on the Monday of Royal Ascot week, 
known as Garter Day.

The former head of the UK’s Armed Forces Air Chief Marshal Lord Stirrup 
was invested by the Queen in the Castle’s Garter throne room, and later 
installed as a Knight Companion during the service in St George’s 
Chapel.

His appointment brings the total number of Garter Knights to 22 out of a
 maximum of 24.

The two vacancies were created by the deaths of Viscount
 Ridley and Baroness Thatcher.

Recipients of the honour are chosen because they have held public 
office, contributed to national life or served the sovereign personally.

The appointment of Knights of the Garter is in the Queen’s gift and is made without consulting ministers.

Other members of the order include former prime minister Sir John Major,
 Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, a past president of the Supreme 
Court, and Admiral Lord Boyce, a former head of the UK’s Armed Forces.

During the service hymns were sung and prayers said for the Order of the Garter.
