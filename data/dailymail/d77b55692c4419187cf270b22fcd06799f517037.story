A toddler has been scarred for life after being mauled by an Alsatian while in the care of his childminder.

Two-year-old Jack Ayton needed 20 stitches in his face after the dog sank its jaws into his nose, lips, cheek, and eyebrows.

He was attacked when his childminder Laura Tonks, 23, took him to visit a relative after picking him up from nursery.

Scarred: Jack Ayton needed 20 stitches when he was attacked by an Alsatian while with his childminder

Jack needed 90 minutes of emergency surgery and doctors say he was lucky not to have been blinded

Jack needed 90 minutes of emergency surgery and doctors say he was lucky not to have been blinded.

The toddler's family are now calling for the pet to be put down to avoid further attacks.

His mother Aimee, 21, a part-time support worker, said: 'I had a phone call from the childminder to say "I'm so sorry, we're in A&E. Jack's been attacked by a dog. You have to come up."

'I was in total shock, I phoned my dad and we rushed up there to see what had happened. I expected the worst, but it was more awful than even that.

'He was in surgery for 90 minutes - it was horrific. He was lucky not to have been blinded in his right eye.'

The attack happened last Wednesday 
morning after Miss Tonks, who is registered with Ofsted, had collected 
him from his playgroup in Gloucester.

But instead of taking him home she took him to visit a relative who owns the Alsatian cross dog.

She says the attack happened after Jack pulled the animal's tail in the kitchen.

After the attack Jack was rushed to Gloucester Royal Hospital, where he was treated for six hours.

Jack's granddad Phil Hicks, 44, said: 'His eyebrow was open and his lip looked like it had another lip coming from it.

'Jack had to have about eight stitches in his eyebrow, another six on the left side of his lip and more inside his mouth. He was in a terrible state.'

Miss Tonks will be interviewed by Ofsted this week and the organisation has the power to revoke her registered childminder status.

Jack is held by his mother Aimee, 21: 'I had a phone call from the childminder to say "I'm so sorry, we're in A&E. Jack's been attacked by a dog. You have to come up." 'I was in total shock ... I expected the worst, but it was more awful than even that'

But yesterday she defended herself and said she had followed all the correct procedures before and after the attack.

She said: 'I reported it to Ofsted as soon as I could. They are coming to talk to me.

'It's
a really unfortunate thing to have happened. I would not become a 
registered childminder to purposely have a dog attack a child.

'I have two children - they are my life. I will probably be shut down now because of this.

'The
family are not thinking what I am going through over this. I was the 
one who saw the attack and had to take Jack to hospital.

'I'm the one whose having nightmares about it.'

Asked whether she thought it appropriate to take Jack to a house with a dog, Laura said: 'I spoke to Aimee and she had said do what you like with him.'

Single mother Aimee and her family have asked Gloucestershire Constabulary to intervene, but officers say they are powerless to take action because the incident happened on private land.

Jack was back in hospital today having his stitches removed under general anaesthetic.

A spokesman for Gloucestershire Constabulary said: 'Our thoughts are with the child and his family at this time. It just goes to show that dogs and children don't necessarily mix.

'We will be speaking to the parents to offer advice on possible civil action that can taken, and to those who were responsible for the dog to warn them of the dangers.'
