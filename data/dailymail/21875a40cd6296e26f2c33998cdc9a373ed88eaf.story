Englishman is tied second in leaderboard after good start

American Russell Henley is setting the pace in Florida

Lee Westwood reckoned it was 21 years since the last time he was asked to strike the opening drive in an event as prestigious as the Players Championship.

‘There were about eight people gathered around the first tee and I think I knew them all by their Christian name,’ he said.

‘There were no shadows creeping up over the tee as the sun came up, no phones going off, and no rattling of change in pockets. It was nice.’

Good start: Lee Westwood is tied second on the early leaderboard

Last week at Quail Hollow he played with Phil Mickelson and Justin Rose. This time, rather bizarrely given he is a former world No 1, he was in the sunrise slot usually the preserve of journeymen.

But if that was a blow to the ego there were plenty of compensatory factors, with no wind and unblemished greens to add to his own aforementioned list.

‘It was like being a golfer with a handicap again, given it was probably worth a shot,’ he said.

The 41-year-old Englishman, who returned to the winner’s circle at the Malaysian Open two weeks ago, took full advantage with a five-under-par 67 that left him tied second on the early leaderboard headed by American Russell Henley on seven under.

Setting the pace: Russell Henley is the early leader in Florida

No European has won in America so far this season, so it was encouraging to see the opening salvo of Westwood (right) backed up by US Open champion Rose and Spaniards Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano and Sergio Garcia, who all returned 67s, while Graeme McDowell shot 69.

This was a heartening start from Rose given his modest record here, with no top 20 finishes in 10 previous appearances. This time he adopted a more cautious approach from the tee and was delighted to see it pay off.

Rose was in the same group as Rory McIlroy, and if ever an opening 70 could be considered disappointing this was it.

McIlroy began at the 10th and by the time he reached the turn he had the ball on a veritable piece of string. So good were his approach shots he birdied the 18th, first and second holes with putts of a combined length of just six feet three inches.

Five under and cruising, the idea that he would go on to drop three shots over the next seven holes seemed preposterous, but it has been that sort of nearly-but-not-quite season for the Northern Irishman to date.

‘A pretty average and frustrating round, given the position I was in,’ he admitted.

It was here last year that Garcia had his fall-out with Tiger Woods, admitting the pair were sworn enemies.

Two weeks later he made his racist-tinged remark at Wentworth that almost cost him his lucrative equipment contract and caused a storm of protest.

No Woods to worry about this year because of injury   — Tiger demolished him in the third round — and Garcia was quick to shoot down American attempts to revisit the incident.

‘It’s in the past so let’s leave it there and look forward to hopefully what’s coming over the next three days,’ he said.
