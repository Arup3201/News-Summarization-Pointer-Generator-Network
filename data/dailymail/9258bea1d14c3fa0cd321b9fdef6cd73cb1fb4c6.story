Getting an allotment is supposed to be the start of the 'Good Life' - as you begin growing your own cheap and healthy vegetables.

But the recent surge in popularity of allotments has apparently been accompanied by rocketing disagreements between plotholders.

And those dreaming of leading an idyllically self-sufficient life should be warned that those 'disagreements' can even extend from the deliberate sabotage of vegetables, to poisoning in water barrels, and even arson attacks on greenhouses.

New figures show that getting closer to nature not a guaranteed escape from rivalry and territorial arguments

According to the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners, it was called to step in to an astonishing 3,500 disputes last year.

The rise in rows seems directly linked to the recent growth in popularity of the hobby - sparked by both the recession, soaring supermarket prices and the increasing popularity of homegrown ingredients for cooking - which has led to a cut in size of some council plots.

And with more allotment holders rubbing shoulders, it seems they are increasingly ready to ball their green fingers into angry fists.

As well as simply having less space to move in, it seems modern-plot holders are more likely to anger others by erecting huge sheds, or controversial additions such as bee hives.

All this, on top of the traditional rivalry between gardeners desperate to grow the biggest cauliflower or carrot in the area.

There are 350,000 allotment-holders in Britain - with a record 150,000 more on waiting lists, which can be 40 years long. Many newcomers to the hobby have been inspired by TV chefs such as Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.

In Cheltenham in Gloucestershire the demand for plots is said to have trebled since 2009. As a result the number of tenants has increased from 555 to 814, with the council said to have cut the size of some plots to accommodate the rise in demand.

Problems have been reported nationwide. In Torquay, the chairman of the local allotment holders' association Tony Mason, 70, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Someone who has a grudge against me has been breaking into my shed.

'They aren't taking anything, they just move things around, as some sort of warning. The attacks aren't random, they only go after the chairman and other committee members.'

Mr Mason claimed a garden ornament owned by his wife Janet had even been moved by his mystery enemies to send him a sinister message.

'They've done it just to say, "If we want to get into your shed we can",' he said.

'I'd rather they just came and told me if they have a problem with the way things are run.'

He said the situation was so bad he had to grow his top crops at a new secret location - and said another member of the allotment committee had his tomatoes wiped out when weedkiller was put in his water tank.

Another committee member had his water tank poisoned with weedkiller, which ruined a tomato crop. In Oldham, Lancashire, gardening newcomer Ben Carcamo, 28, claimed he suffered from failing out with the allotment committee - and was told to vacate his plot simply because it was more vital than rivals'.

The local council stepped in to say he could stay - but he said he could not face returning, the animosity was so great.

Mr Carcamo said: 'My pumpkins are the biggest on the allotment because my land, which was left untended for eight years, is so fertile.

'I thought owning an allotment was going to be idyllic, harmonious, but it couldn't be more different. When I joined, someone actually warned me, "It's not like Alan Titchmarsh here".'

In 2007 only 2.9 per cent of all food consumed in the home was self-produced - but by 2011 it was 5 per cent.
