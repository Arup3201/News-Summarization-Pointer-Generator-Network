Teacher arrested: Former Greer High School choir teacher Jessica Bollinger was arrested last week after admitting to having sex with a student 'at least five times' but insists the affair happened after he graduated

A 31-year-old former choir teacher at a high school in South Carolina was arrested this week after admitting to having sex with a student 'at least five times'.

The principal of Greer High School confronted 31-year-old teacher Jessica Bollinger last November, following allegations that she had sex with a former student.

Bollinger told the principal that she had sex with the student, now 18, 'at least five times' but that their relationship started after he graduated.

Bollinger was officially put on suspension pending an investigation into the allegations on November 20, and she resigned two days later.

Now law enforcement officials are charging Bollinger with sexual battery, saying she had sex with the student months before he graduated - when he was still 17.

They say the relationship started on October 1, 2012 and lasted until the following June 5, 2013.

Though 17 is the age of consent, in South Carolina it is still illegal for a teacher to have sex with a student.

Bollinger had been a teacher at Greer High School since August 2004.

Following Bollinger's arrest, the school made a statement which read: 'Ms Jessica Bollinger, former choral teacher at Greer High School, resigned Friday afternoon, Nov 22, during the course of the district's investigation of the allegations.

Crossing the line: Police investigators believe that the affair started when the student was still 17 and in high school. In South Carolina, it's illegal for a teacher to have sex with a student

Charged: Greer was arrested Thursday and charged with sexual battery with a student 16 or 17 year old, no aggravated force or coercion. Above, Jessica's home in Greer

'She had been placed on administrative leave on Nov 20 pending investigation by the school district and law enforcement. District officials will report their findings to the State Department of Education to take action regarding her teaching certificate.'

Bollinger was arrested last Thursday and charged with sexual battery with a student 16 or 17 years of age, with no aggravated force or coercion. She was released on 8,000 bail.
