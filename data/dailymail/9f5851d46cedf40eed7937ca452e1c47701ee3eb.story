Jorge Luis Pinto has decided to quit as coach of World Cup quarter-finalists Costa Rica because of differences with the football federation.

The 61-year-old Colombian said he was leaving because of disagreements with unnamed members of his coaching staff.

He said they asked that he be fired 1 1/2 years ago.

'I slept with the enemy for 1 1/2 years,' Pinto said. 'I had my differences with the staff. They don't share my style. I'm demanding. I want dedication and effort.'

His two primary assistants were former players Paulo Wanchope and Luis Marin.

Pinto's contract ended after the World Cup.

'It wasn't possible to reach an agreement,' he added. 'I ask myself, "What use are the victories obtained in Brazil?".'

Federation president Eduardo Lee confirmed at a news conference that the two parties had not managed to agree fresh terms.

He said it could take up to three months to name a replacement and Wanchope and Marin would handle the team until then.

Costa Rica had their most successful ever World Cup in Brazil, reaching the last eight for the first time before going out on penalties to the Netherlands earlier this month.

Pinto, who had steered Costa Rica to their fourth finals, watched his team go out 4-3 in a shootout following a 0-0 draw after extra-time.

Rank outsiders Costa Rica began the tournament with a stunning 3-1 upset victory over twice champions Uruguay in their opening Group D match.

They followed up with a 1-0 win over four-times World Cup winners Italy before drawing 0-0 with England.

'Los Ticos' then beat Greece 5-3 in a penalty shootout in the last 16 following a 1-1 draw after extra-time.

One of Pinto's contract requests this month was to be able to choose his own staff.
