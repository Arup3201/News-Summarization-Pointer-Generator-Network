George Osborne's cat Freya has been run over outside the gates of Downing Street.

The Chancellor's pet was 'clipped' by a vehicle on Whitehall last night and has been rushed to a vets for treatment, MailOnline understands.

The concerned Osborne family are waiting for news about the tabby, who has been left battered and bruised by the incident.

George Osborne's pet cat Freya is being treated by vets after being struck by a vehicle outside Downing Street

News of the accident emerged on World Cat Day. Freya has gained a reputation for wandering far and wide from the family home in Downing Street.

Mr Osborne bought the tabby for his children in 2009 when the family were living in Notting Hill, West London. But a few months later, she vanished.

It was not until two years ago, having moved into Downing Street, that Mr Osborne’s wife Frances got a call telling her Freya had been found, apparently living as a stray.

Last year it emerged her tendency to prowl the corridors of power had sparked suggestions she should be being used by foreign spies.

It is thought she was trying to cross Whitehall last night when she was hit by a vehicle. The road stretches from Trafalgar Square, past Downing Street and down to Parliament Square and the Houses of Parliament.

Last year Mr Osborne tweeted a picture of Freya ahead of his Budget, joking there were 'no rabbits in the red box this week - but there was a cat'

Mr Osborne is said to be grateful for the help passers-by gave to Freya, and is hoping she will be allowed home soon

It is not thought her injuries are life-threatening, and family friends say they hope she will be allowed home this weekend.

Mr Osborne has made clear he will be picking up all of the vet bills. 

Freya's tenure in Downing Street has been eventful. In 2012 she was pictured fighting with Larry, the cat belonging to David Cameron brought in to catch mice in Number 10.

In May, the cat was chauffeur-driven back home after turning up frightened and lost in Vauxhall where she was found by homelessness outreach worker Kate Jones who identified her from the tag on her collar.

Ms Jones, who works with Thames Reach's London Street Rescue, said she had lots of experience helping the homeless in London - but that it was the first time she had helped a cat find shelter.

Freya spent the night on Ms Jones's pillow before being collected by Downing Street officials. She had somehow travelled south of the river and at least 1.5 miles before being found.

Ms Jones later posted a picture of the cat with a note to remind Mr Osborne that while she had been given shelter for the night in this instance, most homeless people are not so fortunate.

The Chancellor has built a reputation for being a keen animal lover. In addition to Freya, the Osborne's also have a dog, a young bichon frise named Lola.

Shortly after bowing to demands from their children Luke and Liberty, Mr Osborne said there were 'some early issues with toilet training ... but we don't care. We love her'.
