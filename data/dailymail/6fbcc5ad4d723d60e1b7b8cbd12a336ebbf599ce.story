It is estimated that one in five accidents on motorways are caused by people falling asleep at the wheel.

But a new watch that vibrates to stop divers nodding off on long journeys – and people falling asleep during tedious meetings – could help to keep you alert and safer.

The device, which is yet to be launched, looks like a normal wrist watch but features sensors that can tell if the wearer is awake.

Wakey wakey! The Spark Watch (pictured) which has yet to be launched, looks like a normal wrist watch but features sensors that can tell if the wearer is awake

Spark will use two motion sensors to keep track of a wearer’s movement patterns throughout the day.

Based on their unique patterns, the gadget will be able to detect when they are in the process of dozing off.

If Spark detects that a person has fallen asleep, it will vibrate to wake them back up.

Users will be able to adjust the intensity of the vibration to suit their own preferences.

If wearers want to keep wearing the device over night, they can put the watch in ‘Time Mode’ to turn off the sensors.

There is also a button to tell the time.

If someone wearing the Spark Watch starts to nod off, the built-in motion detectors will activate a vibrating motor, which will start buzzing.

The watch contains two motion sensors that detect movement velocity and frequency. The data collected is processed by a unique algorithm to judge the wearer’s conscious state.

While the vibration generated when a wearer nods off is painless, it is persistent and will continue until the wearer of the watch is awake.

The gadget runs on a lithium-ion battery and lasts between five to seven days on a single charge. It has a micro USB port for charging when needed.

It is designed to keep people alert on long car journeys (pictured) when accidents can occur from drivers nodding off, and during boring business meetings

As well as potentially preventing road accidents, the inventors of the watch suggest that it could be worn by students to stop them falling asleep during long revision sessions or by people trying to stay awake during boring business meetings.

Writing on crowd funding website Kickstarter, where the gadget can be ordered, the inventors said: ‘We created Spark to help you overcome fatigue and drowsiness so that you can be as efficient and focused as possible.

Eddy Zhong, 17, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, said: ‘Spark is a watch that keeps you awake by nudging you when you nod off.

‘The watch keeps track of your movement patterns and uses a unique algorithm to detect your conscious state.

‘Embedded are two custom motion sensors that keep track of movement velocity and movement frequency, respectively. If you doze off, it gently vibrates until you wake back up.

‘The watch keeps people awake during class, at work, or anything else important. You can't always have a cup of coffee, but you can always wear a watch.’

The invention has been launched on Kickstarter, where so far over $21,000 (£12,000) has been raised to put it into production, far exceeding its inventors’ $6,000 (£3,500) goal.

It is available to pre-order for $49 (£29 plus shipping) with an estimated shipping date of November.
