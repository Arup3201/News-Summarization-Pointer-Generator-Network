Nathaniel Clyne is set to make his England debut against Slovenia on Saturday as manager Roy Hodgson prepares to take Calum Chambers out of the firing line.

Nineteen year old Chambers has seen his form suffer in recent weeks and looked like a player in need of a break when Arsenal were beaten at Swansea on Sunday.

It has been a tumultuous few months since his transfer from Southampton, thrust into Arsene Wenger's team on a regular basis after injuries to first-choice defenders.

Hodgson promoted him too in the absence of Kyle Walker and Glen Johnson but now seems set to turn to Southampton full-back Clyne against Slovenia at Wembley.

Clyne has been in fabulous form for the Saints who have made a spectacular start to the Barclays Premier League season.

The 23-year-old has been in tremendous form for his club side Southampton so far this season

He has yet to win a senior cap but was first called into Hodgson's squad for the qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia last month and has impressed in training.

England will train at their camp at St George's Park in Staffordshire on Friday before travelling south for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on Saturday.

Andros Townsend and Michael Carrick have both withdrawn from the original 26 man squad.
