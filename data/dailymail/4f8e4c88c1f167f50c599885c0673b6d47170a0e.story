Harry Kane and Charlie Austin both earned themselves a place inside this week's EA Sports' Player Performance Index (PPI) chart despite both of their respective sides losing, while Saido Berahino was again impressive for West Brom as he scored a crucial winner against Hull.

Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the 10 best Premier League performers from the weekend. Chelsea striker Diego Costa makes the top three but who is this week's No 1?

 10. Laurent Koscielny, Arsenal (PPI score: 32.0)  

The French defender was in impressive form for Arsenal on Sunday as they secured a comfortable 3-0 win at home to Stoke. He gave Arsene Wenger's side the lead after just six minutes at the Emirates, heading home emphatically from close range after a superb assist by Alexis Sanchez. 

As well as this the 29-year-old made a number of key interceptions and clearances (both three), while averaging a 92.5% pass completion rate over the course of the 90 minutes.

The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League.

It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices?

1. Winning performance

2. Player's performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

9. Charlie Austin, QPR (PPI score: 33.1) 

Austin was again on target for Harry Redknapp's men on Saturday - coolly dispatching a first-half penalty against his former side Burnley - although it was all in vain as they fell to a 2-1 defeat against their relegation rivals. 

The 25-year-old put in another tireless display, completing 18 out of the 21 passes he made (85.7% completion rate), while also making two clearances and one interception for his side.

8. Paul Konchesky, Leicester (PPI score: 33.5) 

The experienced defender was sent off in the corresponding fixture against Aston Villa earlier in the season, but the 33-year-old was the difference this time around curling in a wonderful effort - his first for the club - to secure the Foxes a hard-earned win against Paul Lambert's side.

 7. Oscar, Chelsea (PPI score: 34.7)

The Brazilian playmaker was on target for the first time since November for Jose Mourinho's men on Saturday, scoring the opener as they edged past a battling Newcastle side. The 23-year-old successfully completed 30 out of 39 passes in the opposition's half, again impressing as Chelsea went two points clear at the top of the Premier League. 

6. Harry Kane, Tottenham (PPI score: 36.9)  

Tottenham's talisman notched his 18th goal of the season at Selhurst Park on Saturday evening, as he yet again displayed his predatory instincts in front of goal.

Despite giving the visitors the lead the north Londoners eventually fell to a disappointing 2-1 defeat, although through no fault of Kane, who again impressed in a lone role upfront.

5. Saido Berahino, West Bromwich Albion (PPI score: 37.1) 

The England Under 21 international continues to produce the goods for Tony Pulis' side - most recently scoring the all-important winner against fellow strugglers Hull City on Saturday.

Berahino played the full 90 minutes, proving to be a real livewire throughout, completing 21 out of the 24 passes he attempted in Hull's half. The 21-year-old has 14 goals in 25 appearances for the Baggies so far this season. 

4. Jason Puncheon, Crystal Palace (PPI score: 39.9) 

After being out-of-sorts earlier in the season, the Palace winger now seems to have picked up some form.

The 28-year-old scored just his second goal of the season against Mauricio Pochettino's side - earning his side a precious three points in the process.

Puncheon impressed throughout the match, completing 31 out of the 34 passes he attempted on the night (91.2% average), proving to be a real menance to the Spurs defence.

3. Dwight Gayle, Crystal Palace (PPI score: 41.8) 

Ever since he was recalled to the Palace starting line-up, Gayle has proved to be a real attacking threat for the south London outfit - scoring twice in as many games.

The 24-year-old kept his composure when it mattered most, converting a crucial second-half spot-kick for the hosts to level proceedings, scoring his fourth Premier League goal of the season as a result.

As well as being a threat to the opposition, he also carried out his defensive duties efficiently, making two clearance and one interception.

2. Diego Costa, Chelsea (PPI score: 46.1)

The 26-year-old yet again showed his class on Saturday, with his swivel and shot putting the game out of Newcastle's reach at Stamford Bridge.

The former Atletico Madrid striker now has 16 goals in all competitions for club and country so far this season - including four in his last seven games for Jose Mourinho's side. 

1. Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal (PPI score: 66.2)

By some clear distance the former Barcelona forward is EA Sports' No 1 player this week.

The Chile striker was unsurprisingly the Gunners' stand-out performer in Sunday's win against Stoke with yet another scintillating display.

The 26-year-old continued his brilliant run of form against the Potters with a goal and assist during the opening half at the Emirates.
