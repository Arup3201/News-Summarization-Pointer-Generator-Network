Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly is scheduled to undergo surgery Thursday after his oral cancer returned.

The former Buffalo Bills star will be treated at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital and a family friend said Kelly was weak and 'in bad shape' ahead of the procedure.

The tragic news comes as the football player's daughter, Erin Kelly, posted two heartbreaking pictures of her dad.

In one, she's sitting with Kelly on his hospital bed. The comment reads: 'Watching the Syracuse game with daddy... he's my buddy! Love him so much!!'

In another, Kelly is seen walking, assisted, in his hospital ward.

'So thankful that he was up for a little walk today!!! God is good!!!! And He HEALS!!!!' Erin wrote.

Kelly's wife Jill revealed earlier this month that her husband's cancer had come back, eight months after he had part of his jaw and some teeth removed.

Heartbreaking: In another picture, Kelly is seen walking in a hospital ward. 'So thankful that he was up for a little walk today!!! God is good!!!! And He HEALS!!!!' Erin wrote

She wrote on her personal blog late last week that 'the cancer's back, aggressive, and starting to spread.'

The Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo reiterated the sad news in a statement, adding that the cancer was found when the former Buffalo Bills star came in for follow-up testing after last June's oral surgery.

The statement said the hospital's head and neck cancer specialists were determining a course of treatment. Thursday's surgery will be the first step.

Buffalo: Kelly, shown left at 1992's Super Bowl, spent 11 seasons with the Bills before retiring following the 1996 season. He has since made Buffalo his home

Kelly spent 11 seasons with the Bills before retiring following the 1996 season. He has since made Buffalo his home and last week, former teammates Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, and Andre Reed visited the former quarterback.

Kelly and his family have asked that people keep them in their thoughts and prayers.

The cancer battle is not the first tragedy for the family. Kelly's son, Hunter, was born with Krabbe disease, an inherited nervous system disorder. Given little more than three years to live, Hunter died at the age of 8 in 2005.
