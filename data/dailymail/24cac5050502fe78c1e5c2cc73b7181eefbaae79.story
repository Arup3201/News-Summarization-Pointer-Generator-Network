Peter Zervas, pictured in 2009, had half of his nose bitten off in an attack at his Leichhardt home on Tuesday

The man accused of biting off the nose of a former Hells Angel bikie was refused bail because he might return to 'finish the job' and is at risk of a revenge attack.

Nicholas Harafias, 28, appeared in Burwood Local Court on Friday charged with affray and causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

It is alleged the Hurlstone Park man savagely assaulted Peter Zervas outside his Leichhardt unit building in Sydney's inner west on Tuesday.

The attack took place after Mr Zervas answered an intercom call.

The 37-year-old then had to pick the tip of his nose off the ground, drive to the hospital and have it surgically reattached.

Harafias was arrested by police near his Hurlstone Park home on Thursday.

His application for bail was refused, with the prosecution arguing the 28-year-old would return to Mr Zervas's home or work place to 'finish the assault'.

But in court documents, police also said Harafias himself would be at risk if he was released because Mr Zervas may still have strong connections with the Hells Angels.

'The prosecution have serious fears of a reprisal attack on the accused due to the recent and possibly current active senior involvement of the victim with the outlaw motorcycle gang Hells Angels,' the papers said.

Prosecutors did not reveal why the violent confrontation had occurred, but the court heard Harafias told police 'he [Zervas] deserved it'.

Harafis donned a black T-shirt and sat expressionless in the prisoner's dock, while his lawyers said if he was released on bail he would live with his mother in Hurlstone Park, obey curfew conditions and would not approach Mr Zervas.

It comes just days after the man accused of killing Mr Zervas' brother, Mahmoud Hawi (pictured) was granted bail. There is no suggestion the two incidents are connected

But Magistrate Margaret Quinn sided with the prosecution, agreeing the measures would not be enough to reduce the risk Harafias posed to both the community and Mr Zervas.

'They would not be sufficient, in my view, to mitigate those risks,' she said.

Ms Quinn noted even though Mr Zervas had not co-operated with police, the evidence against Harafias was strong.

The court heard the self-employed gym instructor had been captured on CCTV arriving at the Leichhardt residence and leaving covered in blood.

A search of Harafias's home found bloodied clothing and mobile phone data that allegedly incriminated him.

The attack on Mr Zervas came just days after his brother's alleged killer, Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi, was granted bail. There is no suggestion the two incidents are connected.

Mr Zervas' brother, Anthony Zervas, was bashed to death when the Hells Angels and Comancheros clashed at Sydney's domestic airport in 2009.

Days after the killing, Peter Zervas was shot six times outside his mother's home in Sydney's west but survived.

Harafias will return to court on Monday.
