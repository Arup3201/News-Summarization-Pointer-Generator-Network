The Thai government has labelled 65 provinces as disaster zones as residents struggle to cope with winter temperatures of 15C (59F).

In the North of the country a cold snap has seen the mercury drop as low as 1C (34F) in rural areas, with towns and city shivering in temperatures of 14C.

The Government is now handing out free warm clothing and winter blankets to chilly residents, and any province which has more than three consecutive days of sub 15C temperatures can apply for emergency funding.

One 51-year-old man has been killed as a result of the sudden heat drop. Doctors believe he died from the cold weather and rain as he had fallen asleep in the tent after getting drunk.

In the northern Nakhon Phanom province, governor Adisak Thep-art said 10 out of 12 districts have been declared disaster zones with some 100,000 people suffering. So far, 20,000 residents have received winter aid.

Maha Sarakham province in the northeast has also been swept by the cold spell, brought about by an area of high pressure drifting across from China, with up to 200,000 Maha Sarakham residents in danger.

Frost has also been seen for the third time this year on top of Thailand's tallest mountain peak Doi Inthanon in Chiang Mai, a province where six districts have so far been declared as disaster zones.

According to the Changrai Times the frost temperature was recorded at -1.4 degrees Celsius, while the overall temperature has dropped sharply by 6-8C, with temperature in downtown Chiang Mai province recorded at 14.3C.

During a weekly cabinet meeting today, members were briefed on plummeting temperatures in Thailand’s upper parts and the villagers’ lack of warm clothes and blankets.
