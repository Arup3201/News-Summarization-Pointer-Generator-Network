Hatem Ben Arfa has written an open letter to Newcastle United’s fans thanking them for their support.

The 27-year-old – whose contract expires next summer - has likely played his last game for the Magpies after joining Hull City on a season-long loan.

Ben Arfa had been relegated to the reserves by manager Alan Pardew, who criticised the player’s ‘professionalism’.

‘Thank you also to everyone at NUFC and to Hull for making this loan happen.
