Barcelona are ready to blow Arsenal out of the water in the battle to sign Javi Martinez with a £30million-plus bid for the unsettled Bayern Munich defender at the end of the season.

With Lars Bender insisting he will remain with Bayer Leverkusen next season, Arsenal have been alerted to Martinez's possible availability and are believed to have enquired about him.

The 25-year old, who can operate as a midfield anchor man or centre half, has become increasingly disillusioned with a lack of starting opportunities under Pep Guardiola and is seriously thinking about leaving the Allianz Arena.

Wanted man: Bayern Munich are ready to sell Javi Martinez this summer - with Arsenal and Barca interested

It is understood Barcelona are figuring most prominently in his thoughts after he was made aware they see him as the ideal candidate for a defence that has been short of numbers and quality this season, following a hip problem for Gerard Pique and series of niggling injuries that forced Carles Puyol to announce he will quit the Nou Camp this summer.

Martinez is viewed as a Barca-style centre back, with his natural defensive instincts supplemented by an ability on the ball that allows him to function so effectively in midfield. 

They will not hesitate to meet a 
£30m-plus valuation Bayern will demand, should the Bundesliga
 champions reluctantly decide they cannot stand in his way after seeing 
him slip down the pecking order since Guardiola succeeded Jupp Heynckes.

On the run: Martinez is viewed as a Barcelona-style centre-back - and it is understood the Spanish club will not hesitate to meet the £30million-plus asking price

While the Spain defender was a regular pick under Heynckes, following a £32m move from Athletic Bilbao in August 2012, he has struggled to force his way into Guardiola's starting line-up and was overlooked for both legs of Bayern's Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid.

It is thought he would prefer the Nou Camp as his next destination, which would leave Arsene Wenger pondering whether to try and convince Bender he is up to the task of reinforcing Arsenal's midfield.

It may not easy for the Gunners manager, after Bender recently delivered a blunt analysis of his form in the Bundesliga this season and admitted he was 'not yet ready to take command of a really big European club.'
