One of Morrisons' senior executives has been arrested after allegedly buying shares in Ocado before a £216million deal for the online grocer to deliver its food was announced, it emerged today.

Paul Coyle, the supermarket's group treasurer and head of tax, was held before Christmas after an insider trading probe by the Financial Conduct Authority.

He is accused of buying an unknown amount of Ocado shares before the deal was announced, which sent the price rocketing last March.

Ten months on Ocado shares are £2.81 higher and it was the best performing company on the stock market in Europe last year.

Mr Coyle was arrested in Harrogate by Yorkshire Police, but despite not being charged he has not returned to work, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The authorities would only say a 49-year-old Morrisons worker had been arrested as part of an insider trading investigation.

Morrisons has refused to comment.

If convicted, it can lead to a huge fine and up to seven years in prison.

The deal between Ocado and Morrison's allowed the online retailer to turn a profit for the first time, and it will secure at least one new distribution centre from the cash.

Ocado plans to build the centre with its new supermarket partner Morrisons, which began sending out deliveries for the first time this month.

Morrisons has suffered for not having a delivery service and also had a disastrous Christmas in its stores.

Festive sales were down by 5.6 per cent on a year ago and the company now says full-year profits will be at the lower end of forecasts, around £783million.

Its shares slumped 7.75 per cent after a trading performance described as ‘quite awful’ by Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital Stockbrokers.

The company’s growth has been hampered by its relatively small number of convenience stores and its slowness to offer an online shopping service.

Chief executive Dalton Philips said it is working hard to catch up and its first deliveries of online orders went out this month,

By contrast, Aldi and Lidl’s efforts to win over upmarket shoppers were met with success. The stores offered higher quality food and drink, from aged fillet steaks at £5 to award-winning mince pies and fresh turkeys.
