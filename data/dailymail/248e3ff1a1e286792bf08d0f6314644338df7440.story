The eyes of the world will fall on Brazil over the next few years as it hosts the two greatest sporting shows on Earth.

While millions of spectators and the world's press will converge on the South American country for next summer's football World Cup and the Olympics in 2016, a sporting spectacle which is taking place in Mato Grosso has attracted slightly less attention.

Around 1,500 competitors are currently taking part in the 12th International Games of Indigenous People in Cuiaba this week.

Tough competition: Members of the Brazilian Enawene-Awe indigenous ethnic group compete in a tug-of-war competition at the XII Games of the Indigenous People, in Cuiaba

Going for gold: Members of the Brazilian Kaypo Mekrangnoti indigenous ethnic group seem to be taking their event seriously as they strive to win for their tribe

Competitors: Around 1,500 athletes are taking part in the event in Brazil's Mato Grosso region this week

Tradition: Brazilian indigenous women of the Rikbaktsa tribe participate. The games are the 12th to take place since they began in 1996

It may not have the glitz and glamour of a major global sporting event, but the vibrant clothes worn by competitors and spectators alike are equally as colourful and the 30 athletic disciplines are taken just as seriously.

From tug of war, to the Corrida de Tora (race with a trunk) and spear tossing, natives from 49 Brazilian ethnic groups and 17 other countries strive to be the best in their chosen sport.

Each athlete is decked out in the traditional clothing of their people - in some of our images, the only thing that gives away the fact that it is a 21st century competition is the presence of a competitor or spectator using a camera phone to capture the action.

The event is aimed at celebrating and preserving native sports.

Let's all do the conga: It may not have the glitz and glamour of the World Cup or the Olympics, but the event is certainly colourful

Instead of the traditional gold, silver and bronze medals up for grabs, hand carved medals from natural materials taken from local forests are awarded.

The games began in 1996 and they are now considered to be the biggest indigenous sporting event in the world.

Among the other sports on show are 'huka huka' - a type of football in which players may only use their head and not let the ball touch the ground and a tree trunk foot race.

In 2011, the Brazilian Government reportedly spent more than Â£460,000 on the event - an amount dwarfed by the billions being splashed out on the World Cup and Olympics.
