Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe will be quizzed by the Home Affairs Select Committee

Britain's most senior policeman will today face damaging claims that a 2012 Scotland Yard probe into alleged police corruption was a whitewash.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe will be questioned on why his force was dismissive of renewed claims that a notorious detective had been in a corrupt relationship with the gangster father of one of Stephen Lawrence's killers.

In 2012, it was claimed John Davidson, a sergeant who worked on the first Lawrence murder inquiry, may have helped shield Stephen's killers.

Sir Bernard, who took over as Met boss
 in September 2011, asked Detective Superintendent David Hurley to 
investigate. Within a few weeks, he gave the Met a clean bill of health.

Today Sir Bernard will be quizzed about this by the Home Affairs Select Committee.

A
 major review of the Lawrence case by Mark Ellison QC has already 
accused the Met of 'providing misleading reassurance' on the corruption 
issue.

It said the Met's 
2012 report, compiled in a few weeks, stated incorrectly that the force 
had disclosed all 'adverse information' about Davidson to the 1998 
Macpherson inquiry into Stephen's death.

This
 was wrong, according to Mr Ellison, who suggested Mr Hurley should have
 considered police intelligence reports and any corrupt motive Davidson 
may have had for his 'deficiencies' while working on the 1993 Lawrence 
murder probe.

On the report 
by Mr Hurley, Mr Ellison said the Met's 'decision to commission such a 
wide-ranging and significant review over such a tight time-scale was 
unrealistic and ill-judged'.

The withering assessment of the review of the Lawrence corruption allegations in 2012 is deeply embarrassing for Sir Bernard.

Critics
 believe the Met boss should apologise publicly for the flawed report. 
At today's select committee hearing, Sir Bernard will also be grilled 
over a secret memo revealing the truth behind a 'lorry load' of 
anti-corruption files which were shredded by Scotland Yard.

A summary of the files says that investigators gathered evidence of wholesale criminal behaviour by police officers during an undercover probe at the Met in the 1990s.

The memo said corrupt officers: stole and trafficked drugs; shared reward payouts with informants; sold police intelligence to criminals; fabricated applications for more rewards; and accepted bribes to destroy and fabricate evidence.

But the 'lorry load' of information that contained the findings – including documents, photographs and videos – was mysteriously shredded during a two-day operation in 2003 when Sir John Stevens was commissioner and Sir Ian Blair his deputy.

No one at the force has come up with a convincing explanation  for why the files were destroyed.  As revealed in a special investigation in the Mail on Saturday, disturbing questions remain over whether a web of corrupt officers undermined the inquiries into the murders of Stephen Lawrence and private eye Daniel Morgan in 1987.

One potential link between the cases is Davidson, who is suspected of working on the Morgan inquiry in its early stages.

He is also alleged to have had links with gangster Clifford Norris, father of David Norris – one of the two men convicted of Stephen's murder. Davidson, now retired, denies any wrongdoing.
