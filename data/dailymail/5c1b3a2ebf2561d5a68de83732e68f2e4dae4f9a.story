Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson acknowledged that his position will come under scrutiny after the 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa - their 10th match without a win - but reiterated his desire to remain manager.

Those in the away section at Villa Park certainly seemed happy with him, singing his name before and during this game and returning applause when he walked over to clap their support.

His spat with a Leicester fan after the defeat by Liverpool on December 2 overshadowed the build-up to the match, and on Sunday he repeated that it had not been his intention to cause offence to anyone other than the individual concerned.

He took his usual place in the stands, and only travelled down to the touchline at half-time to greet his players in the tunnel and shortly before full-time to shake hands with his Villa counterpart Paul Lambert.

Leicester remain bottom, and an acid test both for manager and team will come when they return to the King Power Stadium to host Manchester City on Saturday.

‘Of course I am a proud man, I want to stay in charge but there is no point allowing these added pressures to affect how I am doing my job,’ he said.

‘I am being rational about the situation we are in and being prepared to work through what is a difficult time.’
