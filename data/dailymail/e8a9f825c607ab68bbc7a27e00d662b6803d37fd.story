Actor Colin Firth, who said he was ‘still processing’ his response to scenes such as gun battles in his new film Kingsman: The Secret Service

He made his name playing calm, civilised gentlemen in films such as Love Actually.

So movie-goers may be shocked at the graphic violence in Colin Firth’s latest film.

The actor, told Empire magazine he was ‘still processing’ his response to scenes such as gun battles in Kingsman: The Secret Service. He called for ‘legitimate discussions’ on whether film-makers should be encouraging audiences to enjoy violence.

Campaigners called his remarks ‘very encouraging’ but urged him to refuse roles in such films in future.

In Kingsman, rated 15 and due for release on January 29, Firth plays a spy training a homeless youngster to be a secret agent.

Kingsman also stars Sir Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson and is released on January 29 with a 15 rating.

It is the latest film from Matthew Vaughn, the husband on supermodel Claudia Schiffer and the director behind the films Layer Cake and Kick-Ass, which both drew attention because of their controversial content.

This latest project sees super-spy Harry Hart, played by Firth, take a rough street kid under his wing and train him to be a lethal secret agent.

But father-of-three Firth said: ‘I’m still processing my response. I did think, “I don’t know what I’m getting into now.” And there will be arguments, legitimate discussions, about whether it’s healthy to enjoy anything with violence. 

'Particularly when you’re dared to enjoy it. I still don’t have the answers on what’s supposed to be good and bad. But I was exhilarated as well.’

His comments have been welcomed by campaigners against on-screen violence, who have called on filmmakers to take note of Firth’s concerns.

Pippa Smith, co-founder of the Safermedia campaign, said: ‘I think it’s very encouraging that an actor of his standing does question this level of violence. I rather hope that at some point someone will say “I’m not going to act in this film because of the levels of violence and I shouldn’t be promoting this sort of violence”, but I’m very encouraged to hear what he’s said.

‘It’s made him worried and concerned obviously and he’s quite right to be concerned that viewers are almost expected to enjoy this sort of violence, otherwise why would they have it in the first place?

‘I think the people who ought to be listening to him are people like the government, like the British Board of Film Classification that classifies films, the people who produce the films, they are who I would consider as the target audience [for his comments]. I don’t know if the lad on the street will care what Colin Firth says.’

However, she is also not convinced that the film’s 15 rating will protect children from being exposed to Kingsman’s violent scenes and dismissed the claim that its tongue-in-cheek tone will lessen its impact.

She added: ‘There is so much violence in the media and it glorifies it for young people, the other thing of course is that it’s not going to be just 15 year olds and up who are going to see the film, once it’s in circulation young kids always see them, it’s just not healthy.’

‘The bottom line is violence is violence. I know a lot of people say if it’s funny it’s not as important but quite frankly, any high level of violence, whatever justification they might try and put forward to it, I don’t think there is any real justification for it.’

This is not the first time an actor has publicly voiced concern over the level of violence in a film they have starred in. In 2013, Jim Carrey criticised Kick Ass 2, which was produced by Kingsman’s director Matthew Vaughn.

Carrey, who played a masked vigilante in the comedy superhero film, said he could no longer support the project following the Sandy Hook school shooting which claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults.

He posted on Twitter: ‘I did Kickass a month b4 Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence.’ And added: ‘My apologies to others involve with the film. I am not ashamed of it but recent events have caused a change in my heart.’

Twentieth Century Fox, who are distributing the film, did not respond to requests for comment.
