Sasha Obama sparked a sellout when she wore a unicorn motif sweater to a basketball game two weeks ago. And now the First Daughter looks set to repeat the demand with her latest animal-themed choice.

The 12-year-old wore a green knitted sweater with a dancing panda intarsia pattern to join her President father for the pardoning of the White House turkey today.

Sasha, who was joined by her father and older sister Malia, teamed the $69 Urban Outfitters creation with a navy coat, purple snood, red jeans and Nineties-chic Dr Martens complete with traditional yellow laces. She gave the look a little polish with a slick of lip gloss too.

For now, Sasha's acrylic-nylon sweater is still in stock on the Urban Outfitters website, but if her last impact on the fashion industry is any indication, that won't be for long.

When she wore an $18 unicorn design to a college basketball game in College Park, Maryland, on November 17, 
its retailer, ASOS, was slammed with requests from shoppers keen to replicate the youngster’s look. It later confirmed that it would be reissuing the sweater, albeit at its original full price of $62.29.

Proud: The two girls flanked their father today as he pardoned a turkey he called 'America's top gobbler.'

Malia, 15, certainly held her own today too. She also opted for a knit, in rather more muted tones of navy and burgundy. She topped off her look with a boyish blazer-style jacket and elegant black leather gloves.

It was the first in a series of cheesy jokes from Barack Obama as a bird named Popcorn beat Caramel to
 become victor in the annual face-off that pits 80 birds against each 
other in a battle to the death.

It was 'quite
 literally the Hunger Games,’ the President quipped, as he granted Caramel a full reprieve from the fate of the dinner table as well.
