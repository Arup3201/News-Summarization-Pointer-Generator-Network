It weighs 33 tons, is made of solid steel and is supposed to be capable of knocking back crowds of rioters in the face of bricks and Molotov cocktails.

But one German police force has been left feeling rather washed out after they managed to damage their brand new €900,000 (£740,000) water cannon simply by pelting it with eggs and tennis balls.

Having taken possession of the Austrian-made 'WaWe 10' water cannon, Thuringia Police decided to test its performance with a series of mock demonstrations.

Pretending to be rioters, officers at first decided to hurl a number of less dangerous items such as bottles, tennis balls and eggs.

But they quickly found they had caused dents the size of fists in the armoured glass, according to The Local which cited broadcaster MDR.

A police spokesman said it did not expect such widespread damage.

What's perhaps more worrying for the government is that it has ordered 78 of the vehicles for use by forces across the country.

Germany's interior ministry has now written to the manufacturer, Rosenbauer, for an explanation.

The Rosenbauer Group is one of the world's three largest manufacturers of fire-service vehicles, based in Leonding, Austria.

Founded in 1866, the company has in recent years expanded into supplying water cannon for police forces.
