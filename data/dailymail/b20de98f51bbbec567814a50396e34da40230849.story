The widow of a slain Austin police officer read letters written by his heartbroken children in court after his killer was sentenced to death.

Brandon Daniel, 26, was sentenced to death late Friday night for the April 2012 shooting death of officer Jamie Padron, but he was not permitted to leave without first hearing from his grieving children.

‘How the hell do I tell two little girls that their daddy is dead?’ Widow Amy Padron said in court she thought after learning of the veteran cop’s death, according to the Austin Statesman.

Beloved father: Six-year-old Olivia's note said her father was 'smart' and 'funny,' but most of all - 'important'

‘Dear bad guy, why did you kill my dad? My dad was important,’ she read from daughter daughter Olivia’s letter while crying, in video of the proceedings broadcast by TWC News Austin.

‘You deserve to be punished. Please be a good guy now. Circle yes or no. You made me have nightmares,’ the six-year-old’s letter continued.

The heart wrenching scene saw Amy Padron alternate by bouts of hysterical crying and furious shouting at her husband’s killer.

‘Get a life behind bars, you will die behind bars....Why my dad? Why Walmart?’ Daughter Ariana’s letter asked.

‘Drunk or not, how stupid are you?’ The 10-year-old girl continued, her letter was 11 pages long. ‘You should be ashamed of yourself and your actions.’

Amy Padron thanked the jury when done, 
telling them it was time to ‘go home and help rebuild my daughters' 
lives. You will be their heroes.’

Padron, a 17-year veteran police officer and former Marine, was gunned down by Daniel after responding early April 6, 2012, to reports of a drunken man shoplifting at an Austin Walmart, according to Officer Down.

Daniel was tackled by Padron when he tried to flee, but shot him in the neck and vest in the ensuing struggle. The father of two was pronounced dead at the scene.

'You're a monster': Linda Diaz, the slain officer's sister, directly attacked Daniel from the witness stand after his death sentence was handed down

Linda Diaz, Jamie Padron’s sister, spoke to directly to her brother’s killer.

‘You are a monster,’ she said to Daniel. ‘You may have ripped my brother out of our lives, but let me tell you something, his spirit lives on, it's alive.

‘You don't get to come here, choose to do a crime and then choose your consequence. Do you understand what I am saying?’ She continued.

‘Yes ma’am,’ the convicted killer answered.

The parting shot came from Johnny Padron, Jamie Padron’s brother.

‘I
 respect our courts, so I won't speak my mind, but I will tell you I 
think you're a coward and I hope you rot in hell. Thank you.’

He later said outside the courtroom that the family feels justice was served.

The tearful confrontations came after Daniel was found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to death by lethal injection..

The former software engineer’s ex-girlfriend cried after the decision was handed down. 

Daniel shot Jamie Padron dead April with a .380 handgun during a confrontation at an Austin Walmart.

Texas law requires all death penalty sentences receive an automatic appeal, it was not immediately clear when Daniel would be back in court for those proceedings.
