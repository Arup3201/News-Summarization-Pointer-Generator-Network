New York City mayoral candidate Bill Thompson conceded the Democratic primary race to Bill de Blasio on Monday.

Thompson dropped out of the race and endorsed de Blasio at an event dubbed a 'unification rally' just after 11am on Monday at New York City Hall.

The move comes as a relief to frontrunner de Blasio, who will now avoid an October 1 runoff in what has become a dramatic battle to replace three-term Mayor Michael Bloomberg

With Thompson out of the race, de Blasio will face Republican nominee Joe Lhota on November 5.

'If this were a general election,' said Thompson, 'you could bet I'd fight to the last vote.'

Now twice an also-ran, Thompson graciously conceded to his fellow Brooklynite Bill de Blasio.

'Today I am proud to stand next to a great New Yorker and throw my full support behind him,' Thompson said.

de Blasio took the stage praising the man he bested and referring to the press event as 'a gathering of friends.'

'For years I've had the honor or working with Bill,' said de Blasio. 'There's no man of greater integrity.'

de Blasio also took the opportunity to praise New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose work for the state de Blasio called 'nothing short of miraculous.'

Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was also in attendance, played a role in brokering the deal, reports the New York Daily News.

'At the end of the day the voters acted and they acted smartly,' Governor Cuomo said at the concession event.

Like fellow Democrat Thompson, Cuomo threw his support behind de Blasio. 'It is my honor to support him,' said Cuomo.

In unofficial returns with 99 percent of precincts reporting, de Blasio had had 40.3 percent of the vote - slightly more than the 40 percent threshold needed to win outright. Thompson was at 26.2 percent.

A runoff had long been expected in the crowded Democratic race. But after last week's unofficial returns put de Blasio above the 40 percent mark, Thompson faced pressure to concede and spare the party further division ahead of the general election.

He said as recently as Sunday he would wait until the official tally was finished.

‘I think that's important. We want to see every vote counted,’ he said then.

Currently the city's elected public advocate, de Blasio has been riding a wave of momentum that built during the last month of his campaign, which he billed as 'a progressive alternative to the Bloomberg era.'

After lagging in the polls, de Blasio got voters' attention by protesting a hospital closing - and getting arrested - and airing ads in which his teenage son gave voice to his liberal platform and showed New Yorkers de Blasio's interracial family.

Thompson, a former city comptroller and the only African-American in the race, ran a more centrist campaign, offering himself as a seasoned, thoughtful manager.

He hadn't led in polls of the crowded Democratic field this year, but supporters noted that he had been underestimated in the past: Thompson came much closer than polls predicted to unseating Bloomberg in 2009, despite being vastly outspent.

De Blasio has said Thompson had every right to want the official count.

On Friday, elections officials began checking vote totals from more than 645,000 ballots cast via lever machines that were hauled out of storage for the primary, after the elections board worried it wouldn't be able to reprogram the city's newer, optical-scanner devices for a potential runoff. That count was finished Sunday night and was to be announced Monday afternoon.

The elections board was beginning to count some 78,000 absentee and other paper ballots Monday.

While a runoff had been anticipated, trying to figure out who would be in it had been something like Parcheesi for politics junkies.

City Council Speaker Christine Quinn was the front-runner for months and was jousting with Thompson for second place in polls as recent as early September. Ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner leaped to the front of the pack for a time after getting into the race in May, before the public learned that his X-rated exchanges with women online continued even after similar sexting spurred his 2011 resignation from Congress.

Regardless of the mayor's race, Democrats still will be asked to go to the polls again on Oct. 1. There's a runoff between City Councilwoman Letitia James and state Sen. Daniel Squadron for the party's nomination to succeed de Blasio as public advocate.

If de Blasio's final vote count ends up below 40 percent, the mayoral primary will also be on the ballot, because Thompson missed the Friday deadline to have it removed.
