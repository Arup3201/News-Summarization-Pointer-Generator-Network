He is supposed to be drumming up major foreign investment for London. But after a six-day photo-opportunity packed tour across India, Boris Johnson is still best known as the man who got stuck on a zipwire, according to one of the country’s top talk show hosts.

Many people in India have not recognised the mop-haired Mayor at all, and some have mistaken him for tennis star Boris Becker and even the King of England.

But chat show host Arnab Goswami – dubbed India’s answer to David Letterman claims millions of Indians do know Mr Johnson for his high wire antics during the London Olympics.

Boris Johnson has used a six-day trade visit to drum up publicity for London, playing cricket on Juhu beach with Mumbai school boys, taking part in a football game, meeting Bollywood film directors and appearing on one of India's biggest chat shows

Mr Johnson ended up dangling from a zipwire in London's Victoria Park in August when a publicity stunt at a public viewing area for the Olympic Games went awry leaving him stranded some 15 feet off the ground

‘Our viewers certainly know who Boris Johnson is because of the Olympics and that memorable moment when he was dangling on a rope, which made headlines all over the place,’ Mr Goswani told reporters.

‘I think that Mr Johnson is an up-and-coming politician. Everyone in India saw the Olympics so they are interested in him personally. Many people in India believe that Boris Johnson is going to go on to greater things.’

But when the London Mayor appeared on his TV show, he played down talk of one day making a bid for Number 10.

‘I can assure that is about as likely as me being decapitated by a frizbee,’ he said.

Mr Johnson also revealed how, when stuck on the zipwire while promoting the 2012 Games, he looked in vain to his special branch protection officer for help.

‘They gave me a security guard during the Olympics. He normally guards Tony Blair but I was given a security guard during the Olympics. I spotted him the crowd and I said: “Carl, can you do something?”

‘Very slowly he reached in to his pocket and took out his mobile phone and took a photograph. That was his contribution to my predicament.’

Earlier Mr Johnson used a trip to the Bombay Stock Exchange to urge George Osborne to consider cutting the top rate of tax.

The London Mayor compared the coalition’s 45 per cent tax rate for highest earners to the 30 per cent paid in India and said the Chancellor should ‘brood on’ whether Britain could be made more attractive for entrepreneurs .

He has spent almost a week on the sub-continent wooing playing football, cricket riding a bicycle and joking about his Bollywood dancing. Labour said he should be focussing on jobs.

The Mayor has insisted his trip is crucial to attracting more investment in London.

Today he met Mumbai-based businessmen 
who suggested the UK capital could lure more trade through lower rates 
of tax and less regulation.

Speaking at the Bombay Stock Exchange Mr Johnson claimed the tax regime ‘needed to be looked at’.

He added: ‘You've got tax rates here 
of only 30 per cent - a point George Osborne might like to brood on. 
It's 10 per cent for freelance income, and of course you have a market 
of about 600 million people under 25.’

Sporting: The children were more interested in the sporting equipment on offer than the presence of either Mr Johnson, right, or England cricketer Kevin Pieterson

Charity: Mr Johnson, pictured playing with a cricket bat and ball, right, and with cricketer Kevin Pieterson (back right) and rugby legend Lawrence Dallaglio (back left) left, took time out from his six day tour of India to see the work of the Magic Bus project

He later told reporters: ‘One 
businessman said to me this morning that he loved London, he loved the 
quality of life in London. There are so many attractions of living in 
London that you can't find anywhere else. That is a very high card.

‘But another businessman asked about 
making London more attractive in terms of tax and regulation and 
certainly the tax regime. As I have said many times before, that needs 
to be looked at.’

Mr Johnson also posed with a bull statue at the exchanges' main entrance, gripping its horns as if he was a rodeo rider desperately clinging on.

He has 
attracted huge media attention during his visit, but faced claims from 
the Labour party that he should have made trade trips during his first 
term as London Mayor.

A 
Labour source said: ‘Boris should spend less time on Bollywood dancing, 
cricket and football and more time meeting Indian business people. 
Taxpayers wanting getting jobs not on a glorified jolly.’

Mr Johnson might not be a seasoned sportsman -
despite being mistaken for Tennis legend Boris Becker during his trip 
of India - but he was able to show off his 
prowess on the football field yesterday as he joined in a game of 
23-a-side in the Mumbai slums.

Never one to find himself on the 
sidelines, the London Mayor donned a charity T shirt and played football
with children from the Magic Bus project, an enterprise ran by a 
British charity.

Until 
now Mr Johnson had enjoyed the royal treatment on his six day tour of 
the subcontinent and had been welcomed by everyone from Bollywood film 
producers to state governors.

But
the mayor took the afternoon off to meet some of the city's poorest 
children when he visited Mumbai's port slum, where the average monthly 
wage is just £25, untreated sewage flows through the streets and there 
is no running water or electricity.

Just
two years ago, the field where the children played was covered in 
'defecation and broken glass' according to one cameraman who had visited
and had to dodge puddles of sewage while the children ran in bare feet.

Now
there was grass and the children - who would otherwise have been out 
gathering rubbish from the dumps surrounding their homes so their 
parents could sell the scraps - were able to play freely.

Unconcerned
by the presence of Mr Johnson, England cricketer Kevin Pieterson or 
Rugby World Cup winner Lawrence Dallaglio, the children rushed to grab 
cricket equipment from the trio.

Joining the youngsters for a game of 
football afterwards, Mr Johnson said that the children had 'zap' after 
being hit repeatedly as the group kicked footballs at each other.

Indian
journalists asked the mayor about his favourite sports. Cricket, tick. 
Football, tick. But they had no idea about Eton’s Wall Game and Mr 
Johnson quickly realised it was best not to try to explain.

It was then time for a round of the hokey-cokey, with what appeared to be some Maori dance moves led by Dallaglio.

By that stage, the mayor’s convoy was moving on. Back through the slum and to Mumbai’s five-star Taj Mahal hotel.
