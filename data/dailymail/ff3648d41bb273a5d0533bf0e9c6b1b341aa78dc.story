There is a pressing issue threatening U.S./Russian relations that has forced some of each nation's highest dignitaries - from senators to ambassadors -  to get involved in what could potentially be the biggest clash between the two superpowers since the end of the Cold War.

The pressing issue du-jour: Yogurt.

The Russian government reportedly has blocked the shipment of thousands of containers of Chobani yogurt to U.S. athletes in Sochi, Russia, who are competing in the Olympic games.

The dispute has gotten so overblown that a sitting U.S. senator has written a strongly worded letter to the Russian ambassador to the United States urging him to allow a 'one-time shipment of Greek yogurt and solely for the consumption of U.S. citizens during the 2014 Olympic games.'

No-gurt: The Russian government has refused to allow U.S.-made Chobani yogurt into the country for U.S. athletes at the Olympics

Diplomacy: Senator Chuck Schumer wrote a strongly worded letter to Russian officials demanding the yogurt be allowed at the games

'With the Sochi Olympic Games starting at the end of this week, there is
 simply no time to waste in getting our Olympic athletes and employees a
 nutritious and delicious breakfast â€“ Chobani Greek Yogurt,' Senator Chuck Schumer - a Democrat from New York - 
said in a statement accompanying his letter to the Russian ambassador.

Worth noting is the fact that Chobani is headquartered in Upstate New York - and is represented in the U.S. Senate by Schumer.

According to the New York Times, there currently is a shipment of 5,000 containers of Chobani yogurt - that was bound for Sochi to be enjoyed by Olympic athletes - sitting in a cold storage unit near Newark Liberty Airport in New Jersey because the Russian government refuses to allow the dairy product within its borders because the U.S. government has not filed the proper paperwork.

Constituents: The Chobani company just happens to be headquartered in upstate New York - where its elected representative to the U.S. Senate is Chuck Schumer

According to Schumer, the customs certifications that the Russian government is requiring for the legal shipping of the yogurt is 'unattainable.'

In his plea for a lift of this yogurt blockade, Schumer argues that Chobani yogurt has become in integral part of many of the athletes' training regiments leading up to the games, and it would be unfair to deny them a key part of their diets.

The Russian government, however, doesn't seem to care.

Yevgeniy Khorishko, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington, said U.S. officials were told about the necessary paperwork, but had failed to comply.

'We are a
 lawful country,' he said. 'You should follow the rules.'

Training: Schumer argues that many athletes relied on Chobani during their training and should be allowed to have it even if they're in Russia

In his letter, Schumer goes on to further advocate for the yogurt company, writing that, 'as the world looks forward to a successful 2014 Winter Olympics, I urge 
your country's immediate approval of the entry of this shipment of 
Chobani Greek yogurt.'

He then thanked the Russians for their attention to this 'urgent matter.'
