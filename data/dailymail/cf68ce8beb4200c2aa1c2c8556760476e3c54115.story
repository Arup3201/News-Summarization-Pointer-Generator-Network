Selhurst Park reduced Luis Suarez to tears and bore witness to John Terry curling up into a ball like an upset child last season.

In both instances it was was the theatre in which Crystal Palace performed minor miracles to derail two title challenges and save themselves from relegation.

When Jose Mourinho told his Chelsea players they were away to Palace in March, most of them had no idea where it was.

They were on a title charge; top of the league since the beginning of February and with only six games remaining.

Mourinho looked set to display yet another stroke of genius by winning the Barclays Premier League in his first season back without a striker of any form or ability all season.

But then they met Tony Pulis's team full of guts and bravery who battled to 1-0 win – thanks to Terry's own goal – which sent Chelsea off course.

The Palace fans still sing about it, fondly remembering Terry curled up – both hands clasped around his head – in his own penalty area after heading past Petr Cech.

Afterwards, Mourinho was asked what his players lacked and simply wrote 'balls' on a piece of paper.

It's safe to say this season his squad will not need an A to Z of London to find Selhurst Park and they will be sure to pack a few extra match-day balls on the team bus.

Chelsea are steamrollering the league with six wins and a draw in their seven games, but Neil Warnock, who replaced Pulis, is not about to let his side be flattened.

'It has got to be a super-human effort,' Warnock said. 'Jose is on about players going through brick walls for him.

'You want your players to do things on a match day and show how much they care, and it's lovely when that happens.'

But he will not be going back through a DVD of the match last season for any tips on how to mastermind victory.

'No I won't,' he added. 'Some of our players are different. Certainly some of their players are different. You have got to concentrate a little bit more on yourself than the opposition.

'I thought they would have won the league last year with a striker.'

Selhurst Park was pivotal yet again in the title race when, with two games to play, top-of-the-league Liverpool visited.

In the famous 'Crystanbul' night, dubbed so by Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel, they came from three goals down to draw, with three goals in the final 10 minutes. The result left Suarez weeping on the pitch.

The body language of the shellshocked Liverpool players suggested they feared the worst and Rodgers conceded the title race in his post-match interview.

They must put something in the water at Selhurst Park; the old-style stands get filled to the rafters with 26,000 fans whose energy crackles and sparks through the cold autumn and winter air.

Warnock said: 'If you're an away team manager, you don't even know when to leave your hotel; it could take half-an-hour or two hours. The dressing rooms have hardly changed. It brings people down to earth. It’s special. It’s intimidating. It’s an old-fashioned ground.

'Palace fans love the name, love the club and they love the ground. It’s still the worst place in the world to get to!'

Perhaps Mourinho will pack the A to Z on Saturday afternoon, just in case.

Having said last season that some of his players hadn't heard of Crystal Palace before their shock 1-0 defeat at Selhurst Park, Jose Mourinho will surely have told his side to brush up on their history before Saturday's clash. Here's 10 things his players should know about the south London club...

1. Crystal Palace were founded in 1905.

2. Palace first reached the old First Division in 1969.

3. In 1973, under the management of Malcolm Allison, Palace change their kit from white with a red and blue sash to their current red and blue stripes. They also changed their nickname from the Glaziers to the Eagles.

4. After winning promotion back to the First Division under Terry Venables in 1979, Palace were famously dubbed the 'team of the Eighties'. Two years later, Palace were relegated after Venables had left for QPR and England left back Kenny Sansom had joined Arsenal, sparking a player exodus.

5. Their highest League finish is third place in 1990-91, the same season they won the Zenith Data Systems Trophy at Wembley.

6. That season Palace finished above Manchester City (5th), Manchester United (6th) and 20 points clear of Chelsea in 11th.

7. The year before, Palace reached their one and only FA Cup final, losing 1-0 in a replay to Manchester United.

8. Palace hold the record for the highest number of points to be relegated from the Premier League with (49 in 1992-93, a 42-match season).

9. The only time four teams have been relegated from the top flight, Palace finished fourth-bottom (1994-95).

10. Twelve players have earned England caps while at Palace, the last being Wilfried Zaha in November 2012.
