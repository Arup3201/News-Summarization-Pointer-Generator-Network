The soldier knew she had to decide quickly who she could save, so she grabbed a black marker and wrote a 'D' on the foreheads of the dead. To people lingering over those killed amid the chaos of the 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood, she shouted: 'You need to move on!'

Sgt. 1st Class Maria Guerra recalled those moments while testifying Thursday during the trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan. The Army psychiatrist is charged with killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 others during a rampage at the sprawling Texas military base.

When prosecutors asked Guerra to describe the scene inside the Soldier Readiness Processing Center, where she worked on the base, her voice began breaking.

In this courtroom sketch today, Staff Sgt. Michael Davis, a victim of the Fort Hood shootings, testifies during the trial of Maj. Nidal Hasan

'I see bodies. I see bodies 
everywhere. And I see blood,' the soldier said. 'No one is moving. There
was no movement. There was no sound. So I yelled out, 'Is everybody OK?
... I started hearing, 'Help me. I'm bleeding. I've been shot. Help 
me.'

Guerra is among dozens 
of witnesses giving emotional testimony about the attack to help 
prosecutors build a rock-solid case for the death penalty in a court 
system known for overturning such sentences. The testimony resumed 
Friday morning.

Hasan is 
acting as his own attorney and has said little during the trial. But he 
raised a rare objection when Guerra said she heard the gunman silence a 
woman who was crying out, 'My baby! My baby!'

Hasan interrupted to ask the judge, 'Would you remind Sgt. 1st Class Guerra that she's under oath?'

The judge, Col. Tara Osborn, did so. But Guerra responded by saying she didn't want to change her testimony.

It
was the only time Hasan objected as more than a dozen witnesses 
testified Thursday, continuing a mostly silent defense strategy that has
caused tension with his standby attorneys. Hasan took responsibility 
for the attack during his opening statement, and the lawyers — who have 
been ordered to help Hasan during the trial — believe he is trying to 
secure himself a death sentence.

The
military lawyers had asked the judge to either allow them to take over 
Hasan's defense or bar him from asking for their help with a strategy 
they oppose, saying his strategy was 'repugnant to defense counsel and 
contrary to our professional obligations.'

'We
believe your order is causing us to violate our rules of professional 
conduct,' Lt. Col. Kris Poppe, Hasan's lead standby attorney, told the 
judge earlier Thursday before witnesses testified.

Osborn
refused and ordered the attorneys to resume their advisory role. The 
attorneys said they would appeal, though no appeal had been filed by the
standby attorneys as of Thursday evening at the Court of Appeals for 
the Armed Forces, according to the court's clerk. A message left with 
the Army Court of Criminal Appeals wasn't immediately returned.

Jeff
Corn, a law professor at South Texas College of Law, predicted that 
such an appeal wouldn't delay the trial and would likely be dismissed.

'As
sympathetic as I am to him (Poppe) and the miserable position he's in, I
think he's stuck. The law is clear: If you are a standby attorney for a
pro-se defendant and the defendant wants to make decisions tactically 
disastrous, that's his prerogative,' Corn said.

Ulterior motives: A standby lawyer argued Maj. Nidal Hasan (shown here in court on Tuesday) is trying to blow his defense so that he is sentenced to death

Blatant: During his brief opening statements on Monday, Hasan said that all of the evidence would show that he was the shooter, and it is unclear how he plans to defend his actions

Admitted shooter: Major Nidal Hasan, seen here in 2010, is representing himself in his own defense as he faces the death penalty for allegedly killing 13 people on Fort Hood Army base in 2009

But
it could also be an intended strategy to spare Hasan the death penalty,
said Joe Gutheinz, a Houston-area attorney and former Army intelligence
officer.

'The judge allowed
him to defend himself, you raised a timely objection. That is the basis
for the appeal. And it was brilliant on the part of all the parties 
involved. If somebody thought up this idea, it was great,' Gutheinz 
said. 'I really believe this is the only way, at end of the day, he will
not be executed.'

As during
previous days during the trial, Hasan rarely spoke Thursday as witness 
after witness described a chaotic, bloody scene inside the Army post's 
processing center where soldiers had been preparing to deploy.

Asked to describe the rate of gunfire, Staff Sgt. Michael Davis quickly hit his hand on the ledge of the witness stand.

'I still thought it was a drill, but I heard some screaming that didn't sound like it was fake,' Davis said.

Davis
testified that he saw blood spray when someone was shot and quickly 
took cover under a desk. When he thought it safe to flee, he stood up 
but was quickly shot in the back.

'It was just a cold, calculated, hard stare as he shot everything that moved,' Spc. Megan Martinez testified.

She
recalled watching Hasan reload his pistol and the weapon's green and 
red laser sights sweeping through the thick, hazy smoke produced by the 
gunfire.

'He was walking back and forth, shooting for what felt like an eternity,' she told jurors.

Hasan is charged with 13 counts of 
premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. If 
convicted, he would face the death penalty.

Hasan,
an American-born Muslim said he was as a soldier who switched sides in 
what he described as a war between America and his Islamic faith.

Hasan wanted to plead guilty to murder and attempted murder, but military rules forbid guilty pleas in death penalty cases.

No American soldier has been 
executed since 1961, and military prosecutors showed that they would 
take no chance of fumbling details that could jeopardize any conviction 
down the line.

Precautions: Armed guards (seen here Tuesday) surround the courthouse on the Texas military base

High security: All cars are being checked for explosives as Fort Hood is operating under extreme caution during the trial

Connected: The government has said that Hasan, a U.S.-born Muslim, had sent more than a dozen emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen

The long-delayed trial was years in the making after judges in the case had granted a series of delays.

A fight over Hasan's beard, which violates military regulations, led to a stay shortly before his trial was expected to begin last year and eventual replacement of the judge.

The trial is playing out amid high security at Fort Hood, where armed guards stood in doorways and 15-foot stacks of shock-absorbing barriers obscured the view of the courthouse.

Jurors were told to prepare for a trial that could take months, and Hasan, who is in a wheelchair, needs regular breaks.
