Britain's housing boom has now spread to every major city, a new report shows.

The top 20 cities in the UK are all experiencing annual house price growth of 5 per cent or more for the first time in a decade.

Market analysts Hometrack said the housing recovery had finally reached northern cities such as Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow and was no longer the preserve of the south.

House prices are rising rapidly across many of Britain's cities according to a new report 

The three cities with the highest house price growth year-on-year are London at 18 per cent, Bristol at 13 per cent and Cambridge at 12 per cent, although momentum in these markets is slowing.

The lowest house price growth was recorded in Glasgow and Liverpool, where it is five per cent, but these cities are continuing to see house prices rising.

There is still some way to go, however, with 11 of the 20 cities recording house prices below the current UK average.

In Liverpool and Glasgow, house prices are 40 per cent below the national average.

London bucks the trend with an average house price of more than double that of the UK at over half a million pounds.

It comes as experts predict prices will rise faster in the UK than London next year because the capital has reached an affordability ceiling.

Estate agents Savills recently forecast that property prices will flatline in London in 2015 but rise by 10 per cent on average elsewhere in Britain.

Richard Donnell, Research Director, Hometrack, said: ‘The pick-up in house prices that started two years ago has spread across all UK cities.

House hunters in London, however, could see prices flatline in 2015 but rise by 10 per cent outside the capital

‘By the end of the year, we could well see monthly house price growth in London slipping below that of some of major cities outside the south east.’

Official figures show house prices are rapidly rising in the east and south-east as workers in London found themselves prices out of capital.

Values in London increased by 19 per cent on the previous year, although prices have fallen back from the record levels seen in August, according to the Office for National Statistics.

In contrast, prices in the East grew at its fastest rate in more than a decade at 13 per cent, while prices in the south-east rose by almost 12 per cent.

Economists said property in London, which now cost on average £508,000, had become so high that workers had been forced to move to the outskirts of the commuter belt.

This had driven up the cost of property in the Home Counties and beyond.
