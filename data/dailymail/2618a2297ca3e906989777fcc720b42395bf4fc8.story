The battle to nail down a starting place for England's World Cup opener against Italy on June 14 starts tonight.

With Peru visiting Wembley in the first of three warm-up matches ahead of the big kick-off in Brazil, manager Roy Hodgson will be looking for early clues as to the best balance of his side.

Nailed on: Glen Johnson (centre) and Gary Cahill (right) are guaranteed to start for England at the World Cup

Hodgson can lay down the foundations 
of his team: Joe Hart in goal with and a back-four which virtually picks
 itself - Glen Johnson, Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines -
 screened by Steven Gerrard.

The captain can either anchor a 
midfield trio, with energetic runners covering the ground on either 
side, or operate in tandem with one other deep-lying midfielder, most 
likely Jack Wilshere or Jordan Henderson.

Both are expected to be given chances to stake their claims tonight.

Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard (centre) will lead England in the World Cup in Brazil

Forward from this point lie the options for Hodgson to tinker with the balance, depending on the style of opponents, conditions and Hodgson’s tactical fancies. Extra pace on the break? Use Raheem Sterling? More defensive protection and industry? Send for James Milner?

Adam Lallana’s 30-minute cameo as a substitute against Denmark confirmed his place in the squad, but has he done enough to force his way into the team against Italy? Lallana looks made for international football, with the vision and invention to see patterns and find passes.

If anything, he looks even better with better players around him and he is versatile.

He,
 more than most, will give Hodgson the scope to flex his formation 
without making substitutions. He can pick Lallana wide in a 4-2-3-1 
shape or tuck him inside and play 4-3-3 for a period if the game 
requires.

What is certain 
though, is that Lallana will need a strong performance against unfancied
 Peru if he is to earn his place in the side.

Skills: Raheem Sterling had an impressive season for Liverpool and could now start for England

Skipper Gerrard is delighted with the competition in the side ahead of the tournament.

He told the Evening Standard: 'It's exciting. That's why the supporters are excited. There are two quality players in every position.

'The manager has gone on record today saying there are places available, which is why the training has been so high intensity and everyone has trained so well. Everyone's desperate to be one of those 11 places. It is a positive.'

Gary Neville on Friday admitted that Hodgson knew 'seven or eight' of his starting XI, with forwards Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge almost certain to start alongside Hart, Johnson, Cahill, Jagielka, Baines and Gerrard.

We will be a lot closer to knowing who will occupy those final three places come full-time tonight.
