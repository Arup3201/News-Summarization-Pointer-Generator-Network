Emma Sheppard, 33, pictured, was jailed for two years after she admitted using homemade 'stingers' to disable three police cars on New Year's Eve

An eco-warrior who disabled three squad cars rushing to New Year Eve call-outs with homemade 'stingers' wanted to 'give the police a taste of their own medicine'.

Emma Sheppard, 33, of no-fixed-abode, left the lumps of wood, embedded with nails across the road from Emersons Green police station in Bristol.

The homemade devices were hidden inside takeaway boxes and covered with leaves on New Year's Eve last. 

Bristol Crown Court heard that three police cars were damaged by the improvised devices as they responded to emergency call outs, destroying four tyres and causing £1,500 worth of damage. 

Sheppard, who denied she was an anarchist, later said her actions were in protest at the death of a black teenager in America, police brutality in Greece and cuts to legal aid.

The carer, who admitted one charge of conspiracy to commit criminal damage being reckless as to whether life was endangered, remained emotionless as she was jailed.

Judge Neil Ford QC, the Recorder of Bristol, said that anarchists in the city had caused £20 million of damage to police, commercial buildings and mobile phone providers in the past four years.

'Responsibility in relation to these incidents has been claimed by what have been described as anarchist groups,' the judge told Sheppard.

'I must make it clear from the start that your offending cannot be linked to that course of conduct, although of course this forms a backdrop to the sentencing process in this case.'

The judge said Sheppard had been caught trying to flee the scene by police officers who spotted her acting suspiciously with another person, who has not been identified. 

Sentencing her at Bristol Crown Court to two years in prison, Judge Neil Ford, QC, told her: 'This was an attack carried out on New Year's Eve when the police were likely to have a high number of calls because of revelry and drunken behaviour.

'This is particularly surprising for someone of your intelligence and behaviour.

'You targeted police officers who act to protect members of the public.

'This must be a demonstration to others that behaviour like this will be met with custodial sentences.

'Actions carried out as part of a campaign of deception will be met by very serious punishment.'

Sheppard and a second unidentified individual, left the improvised stingers outside a Bristol Police Station on New Year's Eve, to disable any squad cars responding to an emergency call for assistance 

The stingers were camouflaged in takeaway boxes covered in leaves and damaged three squad cars

Bristol Crown Court heard how Sheppard built the devices in protest at officers using them around the UK and other police incidents.

The judge added: 'You have told the probation service that when you carried out this offence you had in mind a very well covered case in America of the police reaction to a black man.

'You said you had in mind police brutality in Greece and your own experiences with police at protests you had attended.

'What you have failed to take into account is who it is who it is that is there to protect the people who suffer from domestic abuse.

'The people who are there for the victims of serious violence, the people who arrive at emergency road collisions.

Officers called colleagues for back-up and the three police cars accelerated out of the police station at Concorde House, a building on an industrial estate.

The first driver passed over the debris but suffered a slow puncture and lost control of the vehicle as he approached a nearby dual carriageway, the court heard.

The second car immediately suffered two punctured tyres and had to stop, while the third vehicle had one of its tyres punctured by the stinger despite trying to avoid it.

'The devices which had been secreted under the debris were a number of handmade stingers, fashioned from blocks of wood,' the judge said.

'Each contained five large, prominent nails.'

Sheppard was arrested and taken to Keynsham station where officers found takeaway containers, a plastic bag and leaves in her pocket.

The judge said he had received numerous glowing testimonies on behalf of Sheppard, describing her as compassionate and passionate about justice and equality. 

'Your dislike of the police generally in my judgment is peculiar for someone of your intelligence and sophistication.

'It is strange for someone with your compassion to take steps to endanger police officers who act to protect members of the public.'

Prosecuting, Mark Hollier said officers called for back-up after seeing Sheppard and another person dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered.

He said anarchist groups in Bristol had carried out arson attacks on buildings including North Avon Magistrates Court and at a police centre in Portishead.

Mr Hollier said there was no evidence to link Sheppard to previous offences in the city but he pointed out that the stingers were also aimed against police.

'While it is a matter of fact that no harm was caused to any person the potential is manifest,' Mr Hollier said. 'Three police cars were taken out of action.'

Representing Sheppard, Richard Nile said there was a 'juxtaposition' between the caring work Sheppard had carried out and her offending.

He said motivation from the attack had come from the death of a black teenager in America and police brutality in Greece.

'It is also partly her own observation of peaceful protest and what she perceived as the police going further than they should,' Mr Nile said.

'She had come to the realisation that police used stingers on quite a wide scale. What she was seeking to do was to give the police a taste of their own medicine.'

He said his client had sought to damage one or more police cars but had not intended for further harm to be caused.

Mr Nile said: 'She leads a good life. She is very busy caring for other people and is involved in a number of community projects.

'This is the juxtaposition of someone who works with such compassion and conscience.

'She is not a self-styled anarchist. She puts her time to good use in her community work.

'She has formed this negative view of the police. She has strayed beyond what is reasonable and respectful and has committed this serious offence.

'She very much regrets that. She has strayed beyond what she should have done and is realising the impact of it on those around her.

'She's quite ashamed of the way she has let everyone down.'

Detective Inspector Andy Bevan of Avon and Somerset Police said: 'We have a long and proud history of facilitating peaceful protest and also supporting people who choose alternative lifestyles.

'We respect their right to lead their lives however they choose and the large majority do so in a safe and law-abiding manner.

'Where protest crosses the line into criminality, we'll take a tough stance in order to keep our communities safe and feeling safe.'
