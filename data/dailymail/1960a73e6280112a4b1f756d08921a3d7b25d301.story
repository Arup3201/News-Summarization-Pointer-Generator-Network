An historic lighthouse keeper's cottage overlooking Sydney's clifftops is on the market again - three years after its owners first tried to sell it for $8 million.

The sandstone home on Old South Head Road at Vaucluse in Sydney's affluent eastern suburbs has been listed for $5.6 million. 

The 2,600 square-metre property was put up for sale  by owners Steven and Carmen Davidson in May after they bought it for $2.52 million  from neurosurgeon John Matheson and his wife Jeanne Eve in 2002.

The Davidson's had originally put it on the market in 2011 and were expecting offers around the $8 million mark.

The leasehold property cost $825,000 in 1992 when it was sold by the government and the 125-year lease still has 103 years left.

Towering over the four-bedroom Victorian cottage is the 1883 lighthouse clearly visible on Sydney's headlands.

It replaced the Australia's first lighthouse originally designed by convict architect Francis Greenway in 1818.

The sandstone four-bedroom home on Old South Head Road was built back in 1881 before it was renovated and restored by architect Clive Lucas

The property was believed to have been built around 1881 by James Barnet and was used as the assistant light keeper’s cottage.

The home has since been extensively restored and renovated by architect Clive Lucas.

It's believed to be the oldest intact freestanding lightkeeper's quarters in Australia.

The property is being sold by McGrath's Steven Chen and James Agostini.

'We've had a lot of interest (since) May. It's definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity,' Mr Agostini told Daily Mail Australia.

The home features a huge outdoor barbeque area with power, sink and wine fridge

The home, which has modern indoor entertaining areas, had originally been put on the market in 2011 for $8 million
