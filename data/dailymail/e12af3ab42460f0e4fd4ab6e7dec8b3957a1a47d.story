Gus Poyet is relieved that Seb Larsson did not follow Jack Colback in quitting Sunderland during the summer.

The Swedish midfielder has been the Black Cats' best player so far this season and was man-of-the-match during Sunday's 1-0 win at Newcastle.

Poyet, though, feared losing 29-year-old Larsson when his contract expired in June and thought he would join the likes of Colback, Phil Bardsley, David Vaughan and Craig Gardner in leaving the club on free transfers.

'Three or four players were finishing their contracts last season and we wanted to keep them. There were a couple of situations that broke down very quickly, especially Jack Colback,' said Poyet, whose side entertain Hull this afternoon.

'We were negotiating with both Seb and Jack and we ended up with Seb, so plenty of credit to him for wanting to stay here.

'He's been incredible. He's an important player and I think he's really enjoying his football.

'I cannot be more delighted to have him in my team. It was a great commitment from him as well. Three or four from that team are no longer here, which adds credit to the decision that he made.'
