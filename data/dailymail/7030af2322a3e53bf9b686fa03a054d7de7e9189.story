In the desperate search for bodies after Hurricane Katrina,  rescue teams waded through New Orleans armed with spray cans.

Each crumbling home they searched was marked with an X. 

A number sprayed next to it indicated how many dead bodies lay inside. 

Now, a decade on from one of the most devastating natural disasters in U.S. history that killed more than 1,800 people, the haunting red, yellow and green graffiti lingers in a once-thriving city that has been reduced to squalor.

Devastation: Hurricane Katrina killed more than 1,800 people and cost around $1 trillion in damage after destroying the city of New Orleans

In a series of images by photographer Johnny Joo, the urban area shows no sign of recovery, with overgrown streets and mouldy buildings

Homeless people and drug addicts line the streets, and homes are covered with moss. 

Despite years of work to rectify the damage - around $1 trillion of it - many of the properties look freshly obliterated. 

In a series of images by photographer Johnny Joo, the urban area shows no sign of recovery.

Ohio native Joo, 24, went to the east side of New Orleans, which has been largely neglected as other parts of the city were rejuvenated..  

He said: 'Even before the hurricane hit, a lot of the affected areas had a great deal of poverty, but I was still amazed that so many houses in areas lay in shambles, while people still continue to scrap to live, or support their habits.

'There were an incredible amount of homeless, drug addicts, scrappers all along the area, especially on the East side.

'It was crazy looking into these homes scattered around New Orleans, seeing the deaths marked on doors, along with other information from each home search.

'Xs on homes indicate the house has been searched and cleared after the disaster. Some have numbers and information on either side indicating if any bodies were found.

'At times, I felt scared and I'm pretty sure had we stuck around some of the neighbourhoods too long.'

Rescue teams spray a single diagonal line on a building to indicate that the search is in progress.

An X inside a square means 'Dangerous - Do Not Enter!', whereas an X with writing around it means 'Search Completed'. The writing will include the time and date above the X, who conducted the search on the left, the number of dead below the X, and additional information on the right.

Despite the poverty in the East Side of the city, Joo added that he was impressed with how the rest of the New Orleans has recovered.

He said: 'I was actually surprised by how much effort has went into the cleanup effort, along with how much they have actually accomplished after such an unprecedented disaster.'

The Cleveland-born photojournalist also visited the decaying Six Flags amusement park which was heavily damaged in the floods.

Joo said much like the rest of the East Side, the park had been struggling economically before Katrina hit.

'Six Flags was closed prior to Katrina due to low attendance and financial issues and even when it was open it was somewhat of a ghost town.

'After the hurricane, it was just deemed far too damaged to salvage, so it has been left abandoned and continued to rot.'

The snapper also insisted that more awareness was needed to highlight the continued problems which New Orleans faces, 10 years on.

He said: 'So many people lost their lives, family members, homes and are still living on the streets at no fault of their own - I wish more people could see this forgotten part of America.'
