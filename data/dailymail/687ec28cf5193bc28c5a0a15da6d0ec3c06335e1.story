Retired headmaster: Andrew Allen, 60, siphoned off the money from the bank accounts of his victim

A retired headmaster has been jailed for three and a half years after stealing £215,000 from an elderly woman who trusted him with her money.

Andrew Allen, of Birstall, West Yorkshire, siphoned off the money from the bank accounts of victim Kathleen Steele, who was a life-long friend he knew through his local church.

The 60-year-old Christian was granted power of attorney over her financial affairs in 2007 and began to abuse the trust placed in him, Leeds Crown Court was told yesterday.

Over three years, Allen - who was headmaster of a primary school - made around 250 illegal transactions which included cash withdrawals, transferring money into his own account and making payments to loan companies.

During the period of offending, married father-of-two Allen - who lived in a £240,000 house and was a senior steward and property secretary at Birstall Methodist Church - had also retired from teaching, receiving a lump sum pension payment of £60,000.

His crimes came to light a month after Mrs Steele died in a nursing home in August 2010, aged 83.

The solicitor responsible for her will's 
execution went to police after he had a meeting with Allen and was 
‘astonished’ at how he had behaved. Allen pleaded guilty to three counts
of fraud.

Prosecutor Sam Andrews told the court that investigators were unable to trace where the money went. The court heard a £400,000 High Court civil judgement had already been made against him.

James Keeley, defending, said Allen’s offending was a result of ‘financial mismanagement’, adding: ‘There is no evidence of him having a champagne lifestyle. He is deeply ashamed of himself.’

Judge Christopher Batty said: ‘What I can’t understand is where it has all gone. Mismanagement doesn’t deal with it. It was spent. But spent on what? Certainly the public will never know.’

In a letter to the judge, Allen said: 'I have betrayed the trust of a woman who had only shown me kindness and love and I have earned my punishment.'

Following his sentencing, a spokesman for Birstall Methodist Church told MailOnline: ‘Andrew Allen has pleaded guilty to a serious breach of trust concerning the financial affairs of a vulnerable elderly person and he must now accept the consequences of his actions.

‘When this matter first came to light, he resigned from his positions in the church. We have continued to give pastoral support to all those affected by this. We ask that people respect the privacy of all involved.'
