A Cabinet minister today accused the BBC of being 'utterly negative' about the government's flagship welfare reforms.

Iain Duncan Smith hit back at Radio 4 interviewer Mishal Husain's claims that the Universal Credit system had been 'dogged' with problems.

The Work and Pensions Secretary claimed the Corporation was determined to look for problems in his changes to the benefit system, but insisted they remain on track.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith today accused BBC Radio 4 presenter Mishal Husain of being 'utterly negative' about the government's welfare reforms

Mr Duncan Smith admitted making mistakes in the plans to roll out flagship benefit reforms and said the original 2017 deadline had been 'artificial'.

Universal Credit is now being rolled out to families in the north west of England but it is expected to take until 2019 to put all claimants on to the system.

He said the original plans for rolling out the welfare changes, which combine benefits into a single payment, had been wrong and he had taken the decision two years ago to 'reset' the timings of the project because he recognised that it needed a longer timescale.

But being interviewed on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Duncan Smith repeatedly hit back at the idea that the Universal Credit programme was in crisis.

Miss Husain suggested that ministers had so far only tackled the easy claimants – or the 'low hanging fruit' – and as time goes on it will take longer.

But Mr Duncan Smith insisted: 'I know you want to try and look at this in an utterly negative way.

' Let me explain to you... what we are doing. This is not about low-hanging fruit; we have deliberately set out to roll it out so that each bit of it is tested.

'There is nothing low-hanging about an individual looking for work needing better support.

'So a single person, we get that right; we've then got couples, that's right, that's rolling out; we're now doing families.

'This is deliberately done like this so that we can ensure that as we roll it out we get all the complexities ironed out.'

As the exchange became more fraught, Mr Duncan Smith went on: 'You've said that it's constantly dogged. That's not correct.

'I decided two years ago, having had some outside work look at this, that the wrong way to roll it out, as was originally planned, was to roll it out like tax credits, which as you may remember had been a disaster. They crashed and 400,000 people didn't get their payments.

'I hope anyone listening will recognise that if we do it carefully and we land it safely, they are far better off than trying to rush something for a simple deadline, which actually was artificial in the first place.'

Mr Duncan Smith announced to the Conservative conference in September that he was planning to accelerate the national roll-out of Universal Credit to every community in Britain by the end of 2015-16.

A BBC spokesman defended the interview, adding: 'The roll-out of Universal Credit is a key policy of the Government, and it was relevant to raise some recent criticisms with the Cabinet Minister responsible. Iain Duncan Smith was given ample opportunity to put his point across.'

The exchange happened as Miss Husain tackled the Tory minister over the progress of Universal Credit during the Today programme on Radio 4

The Department for Work and Pensions said today that this will mean one in three of the country's Jobcentres taking claims for the new benefit by spring 2015.

And six Jobcentres in the North West are now taking claims from couples with children and lone parents, who will receive support for childcare via Universal Credit for the first time. Payments will initially cover 70 per cent of childcare costs, rising to 85 per cent in 2016, as announced in the March Budget.

Universal Credit is already available to single and couple claimants in more than 80 Jobcentres in England, Wales and Scotland and will be available in nearly 100 Jobcentres by Christmas, said the DWP.

The department cited research suggesting that claimants find Universal Credit easier to understand than the previous array of benefits and considered that it provided better financial incentives to work.

But shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the Universal Credit programme had become 'a complete shambles'.

'The latest figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show just 17,850 people are claiming Universal Credit - less than 1 per cent of the million people Iain Duncan Smith said would be on the new benefit in April 2014,' said Ms Reeves.

'Labour wants Universal Credit to succeed but the Government's mishandling of the programme has led to huge waste and delays with over £130 million of taxpayers' money wasted on failed IT. It's another example of Tory welfare waste.

'A Labour government would pause Universal Credit for three months to examine whether the programme can be rescued from the shambles David Cameron's Government has left it in.'
