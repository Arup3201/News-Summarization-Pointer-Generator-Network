Following in the footsteps once again of her royal relatives, Pippa Middleton has sealed her new romance - with stockbroker Nico Jackson - at ski resort.

Back in March 2004, Prince William confirmed rumours he was dating Pippa's sister Kate, now his wife the Duchess of Cambridge, when they were pictured together on a ski holiday in Klosters.

Then last month, Prince Harry threw caution to the wind when he was pictured publicly embracing his new girlfriend Cressida Bonas while they were skiing in Verbier.

Now Pippa has confirmed the new love 
of her life is Nico by taking a romantic stroll with him in St Moritz where they walked along the street with their arms around each other.

The pair went for lunch with friends in the Swiss resort last week where they were seen pausing to look at a jewellery store's window display as they strolled arm-in-arm.

They were both wrapped up for the wintry weather with Pippa wearing a beanie hat, fur gloves and a beige knitted cardigan from Celtic & Co.

Pippa also made no secret of her romance on the slopes, planting a kiss on Nico's lips - despite the 
gathered crowds and photographers - at the finish of the Engadin Ski Marathon.

The 29 year old finished eight minutes 
behind 35-year-old Nico in the cross county marathon, in which her 
younger brother, James, also took part.

They were cheered over the finish 
line last weekend by their parents Carole and Michael.

Pippa was all smiles as she finished and embraced her new beau.

An accomplished skier, she said she wasn't 'tired at all,' after finishing 233rd out of 494 skiers in her class in the grueling event.

Pippa and Nico have been rumoured to have been dating since they met on a different ski trip earlier 
this year and Pippa seems to have stuck to the unofficial royal rulebook by confirming they are a couple with a kiss on the slopes.

Nico grew up in a red-brick terraced 
house in a middle-class family in Folkestone before making his millions
 as a stockbroker at Deutsche Bank.

Pippa, who has a six-figure publishing
 deal and a lucrative new column in Waitrose magazine, has previously 
dated investment banker James Matthews, 37, and financier and former 
England cricketer Alex Loudon, 32.

After her romantic trip to St Moritz with Nico, Pippa attended the Cheltenham Festival on Thursday without him. Instead, she was pictured enjoying the horse racing with her good friend, banker Tom Kingston, 34.
