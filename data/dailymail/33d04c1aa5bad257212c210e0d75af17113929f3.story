Syrian rebels have turned to making their own improvised weapons as they continue to fight more heavily armed forces loyal to the country's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad.

A portable rocket-launcher, a hand-grenade and various explosives are among the home-made arms which have been developed by the rebels, who have even resorted to using a PlayStation games console controller to fire mortar rounds.

Lacking in ammunition and anti-aircraft weaponry, they have produced the makeshift arsenal from all the materials they can muster.

Makeshift: Slingshots like these have been made by rebels starved of resources as their conflict with pro-government forces continues

They are trying to combat pro-government forces who are able to call upon tanks, artillery and warplanes.

Arms-maker Abu al-Fadhel demonstrated the unlikely weapons at a location in Aleppo province, which has become a key battleground in the conflict which has ravaged the country for 19 months.

He showed rockets with ranges of up to several miles, which the rebels direct by referring to Google and a compass.

Wearing a keffiyeh scarf to hide his identity on camera, he said he was a scientific researcher and inventor.

He said he had been an explosives engineer in the Syrian Arab Army in the 1970s but had since become opposed to the regime.

'I did not decide to make rockets or weapons only,' he told the AFP news agency. 'I decided to fight this tyrant and unjust ruler who is raining shells... on his people, who killed our children and displaced our women.

Under pressure: Arms-maker Abu al-Fadhel said the rebels needed to make their own weapons because they lacked foreign aid

'Even my son was martyred in one of the battles.'

Abu al-Fadhel said the rebels needed to make their own arms because they lacked foreign aid.

He said that, working with other technicians on a 'production line', he was able to produce hundreds of weapons a day.

The engineer said the materials for the weapons came from local sources and the arms were despatched as far as Homs, another major conflict zone.

They aren't perfect, though. In the Old City area of Aleppo, witnesses saw rebels struggling to unload a mortar powered by a car battery and fired using a Sony PlayStation controller.

A second rudimentary mortar failed to fire, but the rebels packed it away so they could try again later.

It illustrated the stark imbalance 
between the armouries available to Assad's forces and the resisters 
doing their utmost to bring down the regime.

It is not only a lack of weapons that
 has forced the rebels to improvise - as they have driven security 
forces out of cities, they have needed to create makeshift prisons to 
restore order to the streets.

Crime rose in the city of Minbej 
after anti-government forces took control of it in July, and the 
emphasis has turned to rebuilding the police force.

Prisoners have been kept in improvised cells in a hotel because of a lack of suitable facilities.
