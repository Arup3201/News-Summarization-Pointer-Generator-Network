Europe's billion-euro Herschel observatory has stopped working, ending three years of observation of the cool Universe, it was announced yesterday.

Instruments on The European Space Agency's (ESA) flagship observatory have warmed to levels that mean it is now 'blind'.

The demise of Herschel was expected by astronomers as stores of liquid helium that are vital to keeping the temperature close to absolute zero have finally been exhausted.

After 35,000 scientific observations, ESA staff say Herschel has left behind a 'treasure trove of data'.

The pioneering observatory was launched in May, 2009, and studied
the origin and evolution of stars and galaxies in a mission to discover
how the Universe came to be.

At the time of its launch, Herschel 
held 2,300 litres of liquid helium but that has slowly been evaporating 
over the past three years.

Astronomers confirmed it had 
finally run out at the start of the spacecraft's daily 
communication with the ground station in Western Australia.

The timing of its demise was accurately predicted by experts.

Professor Alvaro Giménez Cañete, 
ESA’s director of Science and Robotic Exploration, said: 'Herschel has 
exceeded all expectations, providing us with an incredible treasure 
trove of data that that will keep astronomers busy for many years to 
come.'

The space observatory amassed more than 25,000 hours of data from 600 observing programmes.

The telescope was launched from French Guiana in May, 2009. 

Weighs 3.3 tonnes and its lifespan was 11 months longer than originally predicted.

Its primary mirror is one and a half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope.

Made 35,000 scientific observations and amassed more than 25,000 hours of data.

The space observatory will be sent into permanent orbit around the Sun.

Herschel is named after Sir William Herschel, the discoverer of the infrared spectrum and planet Uranus, and his sister and collaborator Caroline Herschel.

Herschel carried the largest and most powerful infrared telescope ever flown in space and its  primary mirror was 3.5metres in diameter - one and a half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope.

Its telescope captured thousands of 
images of star-forming regions and was able to shine through obstacles 
that block visible light.

Göran Pilbratt, ESA’s Herschel 
Project scientist, said the telescope had given new insight into the 
secret workings of the Universe.

He said: 'Herschel has offered us a new view of the hitherto 
hidden Universe, pointing us to a previously unseen process of star 
birth and galaxy formation, and allowing us to trace water through the 
Universe from molecular clouds to newborn stars and their planet-forming
discs and belts of comets.'

Thomas Passvogel, ESA’s Herschel 
Programme manager, added: 'Herschel’s ground-breaking scientific haul is
in no little part down to the excellent work done by European industry,
institutions and academia in developing, building and operating the 
observatory and its instruments.'

In a demonstration of Herschel's 
work, the ESA released images taken of the Andromeda galaxy showing cool
lanes of forming stars in the finest detail yet.

The unparalleled power of its 
infrared telescope meant it could capture infrared light from some of 
the coolest areas of the Universe, allowing astronomers a glimpse of 
these regions for the first time.

The satellite, which is currently 
1.5million km from Earth, will be propelled into an orbit of the Sun, 
where it will remain indefinitely.

The billion-euro observatory will now be sent into orbit around the Sun, where it will remain indefinitely
