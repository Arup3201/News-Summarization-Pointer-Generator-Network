Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced last night that an ‘army’ of 18,000 people would be deployed by the health service to provide social care to the growing ageing population

A fund to give the elderly better and more dignified care at home is being boosted to £5billion a year, it emerged last night.

Ministers plan to join up health and care services to improve home care as well as cut A&E admissions and hospital stays, helping to save £532million.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced last night that an ‘army’ of 18,000 people would be deployed by the health service to provide social care to the growing ageing population.

The Better Care Fund is intended to prevent 2,000 people a year being admitted to expensive nursing homes and also prevent 160,000 hospital admissions every year, he said.

The fund was first announced by the Government in June 2013, with a value of £3.8billion – but the figure has been increased to £5.3billion each year, which will fund thousands more care workers.

Mr Hunt said it constituted a ‘transformation’ in how healthcare is delivered by moving to a system which ‘helps people stay healthy and happy at home’ rather than centred on hospital stays.

The Government has already promised to protect spending on the health service in the next parliament if they win the next election.

But the Health Secretary suggested some of it would be diverted into a three-pillar plan to adapt to the needs of an ageing society.

He said by 2015, there would be a million more over 65s than in 2010, with long-term conditions such as dementia, diabetes or arthritis.

‘The first pillar of our plan is to change the basic NHS model from one centred on hospital care to one that helps people stay healthy and happy at home,’ he said.

‘Prevention is better than cure – not just for the patient, but for the NHS that picks up the tab when things go wrong.’

The scheme will begin in 151 council areas, and he said it would save the NHS more than £500million in just one year.

The next two pillars of the scheme are to improve efficiency with better IT systems and giving patients access to their own medical records, and changing the health service ‘culture’ to ensure doctors and nurses ‘put patients first’, he said. ‘Too often doctors and nurses have felt frustrated by a culture that stops them putting patients first,’ he writes.

‘We need to change the NHS so that openness about outcomes becomes the norm and we are better at stopping the estimated 12,000 avoidable deaths we still have in the NHS every year.’

Liz Kendall, Labour’s spokesman for care and older people, said: ‘Patients and taxpayers urgently need more joined-up services that help keep people healthy and living at home, rather than ending up in hospital.

‘The Government’s Better Care Fund is depressingly unambitious. It only brings together around 4 per cent of the total we spend on the NHS and social care.’

The promise of better home care support comes only days after charity Age Concern hit out at government plans to restrict help for elderly people to only those who need help with two tasks or more.
