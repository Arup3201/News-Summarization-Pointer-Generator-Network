Online dating without any 'physical contact' is grounds for divorce in  France, a judge has ruled.

A 45-year-old woman was deemed as cheating on her husband for flirting  on the internet with men she had never met, a family court in the  southern city of Aix-en-Provence said.

The couple named only as Nathalie and Bruno, 43, had three children before  separating in 2008 after 18 years together.

A judge has now granted the husband's demand for a divorce, agreeing  that the break-up was the sole fault of the wife due to her online  infidelity and sharing of intimate photographs with a number of men.

She used the Belgium-based social network Netlog to contact the men.

In her defence, the wife claimed she was in contact with the men while she was suffering from depression.

But the judges decided that her depression was not a factor in her visits to the website and last month ruled in favour of Bruno.

The husband's lawyer Helene Poivey-Leclercq said after the hearing: 'Everyone agreed there had been no physical infidelity, but the judge  considered that the act of seeking an extra-marital relationship was  offensive behaviour towards the husband.

'French law states that spouses owe each other mutual respect, fidelity  and help. It was in this notion of respect that the wife had failed.'

A survey last month revealed that a fifth of people aged 18-35 have secretly used dating websites behind their partner’s back while in a relationship.

According to a new study, 21 per cent of coupled-up people in the UK between the ages of 18 and 35 have used dating apps or websites without their partner’s knowledge.

Respondents were initially asked ‘Have you ever used dating websites?’ to which 58 per cent said that ‘yes’ they had, whilst the remaining respondents claimed not to have done so.

They were then asked ‘Have you ever used a dating website or app whilst in a relationship?’ to which 21 per cent of all respondents said that ‘yes’, they had in the past.

A further 14 per cent, one in seven, admitted that they had used a dating website or app while in their ‘current relationship’.

The most commonly used dating websites amongst those in relationships were Plenty of Fish (43 per cent), followed by the dating app Tinder (37 per cent) while 29 per cent even paid to be members of Match.com.
