Team news

Hull 

Hull manager Steve Bruce must decide which of his four deadline day signings are ready to feature against West Ham on Monday night.

Record signing Abel Hernandez is doubtful as he awaits the correct work permit documentation and both Hatem Ben Arfa and Gaston Ramirez are short of full match fitness, making Mohamed Diame the most likely to start against the club he signed from.

Hatem Ben Arfa is lacking match fitness for Hull after signing from Newcastle

James Chester is available again after suspension, Andrew Robertson is battling a calf injury and Michael Dawson is set for a home debut.

Provisional squad: McGregor, Harper, Davies, Dawson, Rosenior, Robertson, Diame, McShane, Elmohamady, Huddlestone, Livermore, Ince, Brady, Jelavic, Aluko, Sagbo, Quinn, Meyler, Hernandez, Ben Arfa, Rodriguez.

West Ham

Both Alex Song and Morgan Amalfitano are in line to make their West Ham debuts in Monday's Barclays Premier League clash at Hull.

The duo were brought in at the back end of the transfer window and will be included in Sam Allardyce's squad for the game at the KC Stadium.

Alex Song was unveiled at Upton Park before West Ham's 3-1 defeat by Southampton last month

James Collins has recovered from a hamstring problem and will be in contention but Allardyce has cast doubts on whether Matt Jarvis (thigh) or Carl Jenkinson (hamstring) are fit enough to feature - with Andy Carroll (ankle) and Kevin Nolan (shoulder) definite absentees.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, O'Brien, Reid, Burke, Tomkins, Collins, Demel, Jenkinson, Noble, Kouyate, Song, Poyet, Morrison, Amalfitano, Downing, Jarvis, Vaz Te, Cole, Zarate, Sakho, Valencia.

The Hammers have won four of their last five league games against Hull City (L1).

Carlton Cole has scored four goals and one own goal in his last five games against Hull City.

The most recent occasion in which the Hammers scored seven (or more) goals in a league game came when they beat Hull City 7-1 in October 1990.

None of West Ham’s last 18 Premier League games have ended level (W8 L10).

Nikica Jelavic has scored with both of his shots on target this season.

Hull’s new signing Abel Hernandez scored just once in 14 appearances in his last top-flight season (2012/13, Serie A) though he did score 14 times in Serie B last term.

The Tigers have had fewer shots than any other Premier League side this season (18).

Steve Bruce’s side have also seen their woodwork hit a league-high three times.

West Ham have scored more goals from outside the box than any other Premier League team this term (3).
