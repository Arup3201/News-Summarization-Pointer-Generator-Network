A pensioner who battered his 74-year old wife to death with a garden statue after he went berserk at their seaside retirement home was today is facing jail.

Fred Gilliard, 75, beat wife June with an Easter Island head they kept on the front lawn and also stabbed her whilst suffering 'a major depressive episode.'

Police were called to the couple’s £150,000 seaside semi detached home in Blackpool, Lancs after it is believed they were called by Gilliard himself.

Guilty: Fred Gilliard, left, beat wife June, right, with an Easter Island head they kept on the front lawn and also stabbed her whilst suffering 'a major depressive episode'

His wife was lying dead inside and officers also recovered a knife from the scene. Gillliard was later led from the house in handcuffs.

A post mortem examination established June died from multiple injuries, consistent with being stabbed repeatedly and struck to the head with a heavy object. The motive for the killing is not known.

Today at Preston Crown Court Gilliard pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after his not guilty plea to murder was accepted by the prosecution.

Scene: Police were called to the couple's £150,000 seaside semi detached home in Blackpool, Lancs after it is believed they were called by Gilliard himself

Statues: Police cordoned off the smart house where a grey Nissan Qashqai was parked in the drive. The front garden has a statue of a puppy and a buddha's head

Dressed smartly in a suit, he had to use headphones to listen to the proceedings.

Stuart
Denney QC, prosecuting, said: 'A report has been received and it 
concluded that he was suffering a major depressive episode which caused a
loss of control and, in the opinion of the doctor, his responsibility 
got his acts was diminished.

The weapon: Mr Gilliard beat his wife to death with a souvenir garden statuette in the shape of one of the monolithic stone statues on Easter Island, in the Pacific Ocean

'Having
borne in mind the lack of previous history and having borne in mind the
nature of the attack, and what was said and done afterwards, we have 
concluded with family and senior police officers we cannot properly ask 
the jury to reject the medical evidence.'

Gilliard will be sentenced next month following the preparation of further psychiatric reports.

Judge Anthony Russell QC told him: 'The outcome is that you will be detained for some significant time but it is appropriate for me to consider whether that should be in hospital or in prison.'

The tragedy occurred last February 10 years after the elderly couple, formerly of Yorkshire, moved to the property so they could enjoy their retirement by the seaside.

Police cordoned off the smart house where a grey Nissan Qashqai was parked in the drive. The front garden has a statue of a puppy and a buddha’s head.

At the time a neighbour said: 'They were quiet, reserved and very nice people. They kept themselves to themselves - they were very rarely out in the garden. The lady was quite large and also came from Yorkshire - we had something in common.

'Her husband was quieter and I think he used to drive an ambulance or used to be a paramedic. They went on holiday to Canada a lot.'

'I think it’s really sad. It must be an absolute tragedy for the family.'

In a statement the Gilliard’s family said: 'As a family we are stunned and devastated by this tragic turn of events involving both of our parents.

'We are an extremely close family and both Mum and Dad are loving and cherished parents. We are struggling to come to terms with the tragedy of the situation.'
