Dozens of Twitter trolls are sending bomb threats to American Airlines, just days after a Dutch teenager was arrested for the same prank.

'Prank' messages are being tweeted to the airline, threatening specific flights or just claiming that bombs are set to go off on a certain date or time.

A user calling himself AldoFernz tweeted: '@AmericanAir the bomb goes of in 3 hours.'

Threats: Twitter trolls have been sending hoax messages to American Airlines

However, after a flood of abuse he took the comment down and wrote: 'my apologies go out to all, but why can't y'all take a joke.'

While another user, known as ComedyBatman, wrote: '@AmericanAir You really seem to not care that i’m about to bomb your plane that’s headed to Paris. Btw, my name is Ahmed.'

Prank: Twitter users have not taken heed of what happened to Dutch teenager Sarah, who threatened American Airlines

The theme of the tweets was to threaten to be a member of Al Qaeda, much as the Dutch teenager did with her prank from the Twitter account @QueenDemetriax_.

One called Sebastian Soko tweeted: 'HI STAY SAFE BECAUSE I'M GOING TO THROW A MASSIVE BOMB AT JUNE 3TH ANY AIRPLANE GOING TO US. ALQAEDA IS STILL ALIVE.'

And a user called Cinow75 wrote: 'In two days a bomb is going to explode in one of your planes.'

However, he seemed to back out of his prank with a follow-up message reading: '@AmericanAir It's #Joke don't panic ! hahaha'

Bad idea: The teen immediately regretted sending this 'joke' bomb threat

The flood of messages comes after a 14-year-old Dutch girl - named Sarah - was arrested in Rotterdam after tweeting a threat to American Airlines and claiming to be an Al Qaeda operative.

Roland Ekkers, a spokesman for Rotterdam police, told MailOnline that officers in the city had launched an investigation into the tweet after it was reported around the world.

But before detectives could track the girl down, she walked into a police station accompanied by a family member.

Mr Ekkers said: 'Police spoke to prosecutors to decide whether we could arrest her and, after some deliberation, we decided that we could arrest her and she has been arrested.

'She is now being interviewed by specially-trained officers who are used to speaking to young offenders.'

Mr Ekkers said the girl has not been charged with any offence, but could face charges related to 'making false threats'.

It was just a joke: The girl insisted she was joking and not from Afghanistan, but the airline did not reply

Worried: The girl expressed her fear and threw her friend under the bus, anything to avoid being in trouble

The teenager sent: 'hello my name’s 
Ibrahim and I’m from Afghanistan. I’m part of Al Qaida and on June 1st 
I’m gonna do something really big bye.'

However her prank went wrong when American Airlines replied, stating: 'Sarah, we take these threats very seriously. Your IP address and details will be forwarded to security and the FBI.'

The young girl's subsequent public meltdown on Twitter, in which she explained that she was joking and begged the airline to reconsider, went viral until her account was suspended., but not before her followers increased to more than 30,000.

The teenager wrote in response: 'I always wanted to be famous. But I meant like Demi Lovato famous, not Osama bin laden famous.'

Both the American Airlines and Sarah’s tweet were eventually deleted, and it is not exactly clear if any call to the FBI was ever made.

‘We took it down basically because it generated a lot of traffic,’ spokeswoman Dori Alvarez told the New York Daily News. ‘We took it down so we could better focus on our customers.’

Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the matter to the New York Post, but tweeted that ‘only law enforcement can request private information about Twitter accounts.’

Sarah expressed remorse for the stunt, wondering aloud why she did it – but the she wrote ‘I changed my name to Ibrahim.’
