Arsene Wenger said there is nothing ‘lucky’ about Arsenal's title challenge after they returned to the top of the Barclays Premier League with a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace.

Arsenal will be overhauled if Manchester City beat Chelsea at the Etihad this evening but Wenger said that his men were right in the title hunt, insisting: ‘You cannot be lucky over 24 games.

'We have faced questions about our ability since the start of the season, but where we are cannot be a coincidence.’

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored both Arsenal’s goals and Wenger said: 'I always believed that he could play wide and central, I said that many times that his future will be central.

'He has proven me right today, by scoring the goals but also by the quality of his performance.'

The Arsenal boss intends to keep an interested eye on events at the Etihad Stadium on Monday.

'It is two competitors against us and it is always interesting to see how they behave,' he said.

'We gained some points through some 
other opponents like Liverpool and Man United over this weekend, and I 
think we know that our results at the Emirates (Stadium) will be 
massively important until the end.'

Wenger also revealed that new signing Kim Kallstrom was signed on deadline day despite a scan showing the Swedish midfielder has a micro-fracture in his back.

His club Spartak Moscow have agreed a compromise deal and will pay his wages for the next six weeks.

‘It
crossed my mind not to sign him on Friday night and if we had two or 
three days more then maybe we wouldn’t have done it,’ admitted Wenger.

‘Let
us establish the truth. He felt his back two days 
before the medical. We discovered a micro-fracture and we have all 
played with them.

‘It is on his vertebrae, so the best case scenario is for him to play at the end of February, not before.’
