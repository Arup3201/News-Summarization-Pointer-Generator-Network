The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, now under fire for its sloppy handling of Ebola virus cases in the U.S., spent time and resources in 2011 to educate Americans about the epidemic threat posed by a zombie apocalypse.

'If you're ready for a Zombie Apocalypse, you're ready for any emergency,' read one CDC Internet graphic designed to be spread – virally – on social media.

The campaign, complete with a gorey 36-page graphic novella called 'Preparedness 101: Zombie Pandemic',' a 'Zombie blog' and slick horror-movie posters, drew applause from fans of the AMC series 'The Walking Dead,' but eye-rolls from most everyone else.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE CDC'S GRAPHIC NOVELLA 

The CDC ran a social media campaign in 2011 urging Americans to make a preparedness kit – to hedge again zombie attacks

This poster, produced by the CDC, was meant to capitalize on the popularity of the AMC series 'Walking Dead' 

Now, in the context of the Ebola crisis, the effort strikes some as wasted and frivolous.

'I know it was "cool" back then,' one tweet sent Thursday read, 'but in retrospect, maybe the time and effort put into the CDC's Zombie Preparedness 101 was poorly spent.'

But the Obama administration's CDC was deadly serious about using the brain-eating undead as a proxy for real crises, telling people to put together emergency kits just in case.

'If you are generally well equipped to deal with a zombie apocalypse, you will be prepared for a hurricane, pandemic, earthquake, or terrorist attack,' said then-Assistant Surgeon General Dr. Ali Khan.

At the time, he was in charge of the CDC's Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response.

Dr. Thomas Frieden, the CDC's director, was in charge of the agency in 2011. He took the job at the beginning of the Obama administration.

Frieden has come under fire for fumbling the first three Ebola cases diagnosed on U.S. soil, including one where the agency told a nurse with direct exposure to an Ebola patient that she could get on a commercial aircraft.

As serious a topic as Ebola is, the CDC was trying to latch on to pop culture with its zombie stunt.

'There are all kinds of emergencies out there that we can prepare for,' the agency's Zombie Preparedness website, which is still online, reads.

'Take a zombie apocalypse for example. That’s right, I said z-o-m-b-i-e a-p-o-c-a-l-y-p-s-e. You may laugh now, but when it happens you’ll be happy you read this, and hey, maybe you’ll even learn a thing or two about how to prepare for a real emergency.'

Reactions from Web surfers were mixed.

'This might just actually spur me to make that emergency kid (sic),' one wrote. 'CDC, you are made of awesome.'

The writer quickly amended those words: 'Guess I’ll stick to making an emergency kiT, since I’ve already made the emergency kid.'

The CDC's social media campaign helped urge Americans to prepare for zombies, suggesting that preparing for the undead would be no harder than preparing for Ebola

Twitter was a hotbed of zombie speculation on Thursday with manyn users nonplussed at the CDC's use of time and resources three years ago

Others were unimpressed, including an EMT, self-described as 'a huge zombie fan, and well prepared for disaster.'

'In a time when the Federal Government has a $14.3 Trillion debt, and cannot control spending,' that reader's message read, 'can you please post exactly how much government employee and/or contractor time was used to create this entertaining but wasteful page (including planning and approval), and how much it costs us (the taxpayer) in IT Services and support on expensive, secured government equipment to maintain such pages on a annual basis?'

'It’s not that I don’t think that you did a great jobs (sic), and I thank you for the laughs. I just want to know how much these moments cost us.'

Another remarked that 'the only thing more disturbing than the CDC posting this nonsense is the number of people who seem glad that they did.'

The USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism commissioned a case study based on the campaign, collecting responses from government, authors and other opinion shapers.

One news anchor at WGN‑TV in Chicago, the report related, 'dismissed her station’s report on the campaign by saying on air, "This is baloney".'

'Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly called it one of the "dumbest things of the week." And an editorial in a small North Carolina newspaper commented: "We believe Khan's time and our tax dollars could have been better spent providing instructions to readers on how to prepare for a real outbreak or hurricane or tornado."

The Gazette in Colorado Springs, however, praised the initiative.

'What's so great about this effort,' an editorial in that paper read, 'is that it cost the CDC all of $87 for a stock photo, and some staff time, rather than the millions spent on public information programs that nobody pays attention to.'

The cost of that staff time was never reported, nor was the cost of commissioning the graphic novella, nor the opportunity cost related to putting genuine crises on the back-burner.

Casting corpses that dine on brains as government disease antagonists, one conservative Republican campaign consultant told MailOnline, is full of irony.

'This is something the Obama administration can do without fear that it would blow back on them,' the operative said.

'The last time there were any brains in that building, Reagan was president. So if the zombies did come, the West Wing wouldn't look too appetizing.'
