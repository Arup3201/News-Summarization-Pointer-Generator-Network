A mother of five whose two-year-old son could die at any moment without round the clock care has told how she 'cried with happiness' after her campaign to stop her son’s help being cut was successful.

Sarah Walton pleaded with the South Australian Government after they announced they were going to take away the highly-trained nurse who helps look after her son Zackary one day a week.

Zackary has Treacher Collins Syndrome and also has a tracheostomy, which means his airway is compromised and could be obstructed at any moment.

‘We have to monitor him around the clock. It's already highly stressful and exhausting, and the one day of respite care allowed us to get by,’ Mrs Walton wrote on a change.org petition that has been signed by over 37,000 people.

The 27-year-old found out on Friday morning that the National Disability Insurance Scheme will reinstate Zackary’s nurse after public outcry about the decision to cut his help.

The family live in Mannum, in South Australia, about an hour and a half from Adelaide, and living rurally means their local hospital isn't trained to deal with emergencies for people with a tracheostomy.

Mrs Walton, who also looks after her four other children at home while her husband works long hours to make ends meet, said the response has been ‘overwhelming’.

‘I cried I was so happy. It just means so much. It means I will be able to manage, to look forward to things and plan things again,’ Mrs Walton told Daily Mail Australia.

On Mrs Walton’s moving change.org petition she wrote: ‘It's a scary weight to carry around, knowing that it's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive'

‘I can do all the things everyone takes for granted again – one day a week - now without worrying about equipment or life or death.

‘I can get in the car and just breathe,’ she said.

Mrs Walton is looking forward to being able to continue to take her other children, Patience, Imali, Briella and Kynan, to the movies and the beach one day a week in the school holidays.

‘Zackary can’t go anywhere like that so the other kids miss out,’ she said.

‘And I can get my hair done and go food shopping, pay the bills, get in and out of the car, have coffee and have time to organise birthday presents - just the little things.’

The mother described how Zackary ‘absolutely adores’ the nurse who looks after him one day a week and is ‘very particular with people’.

Over the next few years things are only going to get harder for the Walton family as Zackary begins major re-constructive surgery.

The relief Mrs Walton feels knowing that a nurse will be there to help – at least for the foreseeable future – is palpable.

‘If anything it will get worse, not him but the issues he faces. For example he doesn’t get head colds, it goes straight through his lungs… he will be starting kinder soon and the more he goes out the more he gets sick,’ she said describing the challenges ahead.

Treacher Collins syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of the head. 

It prevents the skull, cheek and jawbones from developing properly, causing facial defects and hearing loss. About one child in every 50,000 is affected. 

Problems range in severity from mild to very severe. In most cases, the child’s intelligence is normal.

‘He will also have some big surgery. From next year he will have a jaw… they will break it at the back and slowly turn it millimetres per day to bring it forward. He will also have his checks rebuilt and the surgery will go into adulthood.

‘There is no guarantee that he’ll ever not need a feeding tube.’

On Mrs Walton’s moving change.org petition she wrote: ‘It's a scary weight to carry around, knowing that it's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive. It's a weight parents of children with tracheostomies shouldn't have to bear just because they live in a rural area.

‘That's not right. We can't easily just move. We own our home, we'd need to uproot our other children, we have family here, we have hopes and dreams and aspirations for our future in this town. We just want to safely be able to include our son in that future.’

The family are still calling for more training about tracheostomy patients for doctors and nurses in rural hospitals.

‘This is my son's life at stake. It's also the lives of many other children with tracheostomy who are being ignored and neglected. Right now it seems like only a matter of time before the unthinkable happens, and someone like my son dies because of the lack of training and help the government is giving to rural tracheostomy patients,’ she wrote.
