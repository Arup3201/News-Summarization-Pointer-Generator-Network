Two teenage boys have been jailed for the murder of a young father after their gang gatecrashed a birthday party.

Ayomindy Bile, 15, and Jesse Quaye, 18, were convicted of brutally stabbing 20-year-old Connor Barrett after a four-week trial in November.

The father-of-one was stabbed in the chest and back at a party in a family home in Hemsby, Norfolk in May last year.

He was attacked after a large group of uninvited guests, including Bile and Quaye, turned up and began to cause trouble.

Norwich Crown Court heard Bile, who can be named after an anonymity order was lifted, pulled out a knife.

He and Quaye then attacked Mr Barrett and stabbed him in the back after he confronted them about punching his friend.

The court heard that Bile then bragged to his friends how he had 'hooked him' as his victim's young brother watched him die.

It also emerged the 15-year-old was on bail at the time for possession of a kitchen knife in a public place after being arrested two weeks earlier.

He also has two previous convictions for street robberies dating from when he was 13.

Quaye, of Cobholm, Norfolk, and Bile, of Great Yarmouth, were jailed for 15 years each on Friday after being found guilty of murder.

Judge Stephen Holt said: 'Connor was a much loved young man who was the life and soul of most parties. He preferred talking to violence.

'The whole atmosphere changed when you two turned up to a party with a group of friends.

'Before the violence kicked of Bile produced a flick knife. When asked why you were carrying a flick knife your response was "if anyone f***s with me they'll get it in there".

'Connor approached and he was unarmed. He was surrounded by you and your gang.

'One of the wounds on his back would have required severe force - according to the pathologist it splintered bone.

'We will never know who inflicted that fatal wound. Bile then bragged 'I hooked him'.

'Connor's family were at that party and his younger brother watched his life slip away.'

The judge added: 'This is a truly tragic case and there are no winners.

'A decent and loving young man has had his life taken leaving his family and friends distraught and young son's life devastated.

'The one message that must go out is that is if young men don't carry knives they are not going to be able to pull them out and use them

'If they do, they may use them with tragic results. This message has to be got across to young people.'

The teenagers were also found guilty of actual bodily harm to Ricky Halliday, the party-goer Mr Barrett was trying to defend.

Bile pleaded guilty and Quaye was found guilty of possessing offensive weapons.

A third defendant, Anthony McLean, 41, also from Great Yarmouth, was found guilty of assisting Quaye to evade justice.

A court heard he drove the teen to London in the hours after the attack. He was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.

Amjad Malik, prosecuting, said Mr Barrett had been DJing at the 21st birthday party when Bile and Quaye arrived having heard about it on social media.

When a fight broke out, Mr Barrett intervened in an attempt to protect his friend Mr Halliday and tried to talk to the defendants.

But instead he was brutally stabbed multiple times before the cowardly teenagers fled.

Paul Keleher, mitigating for Quaye, said he had a troubled upbringing and a 'misguided view' that he needed a knife for self-defence.

After the case, the victim's family said they had suffered 'immeasurable sadness' since his death.

They said: 'Connor was a considerate, kind, caring and loving great grandson, grandson, son, brother, nephew and cousin. He was also a dedicated and devoted father to his own son.

'His life has been cruelly stolen from him and his family, when he was coming into the prime of his life just a month away from his 21st birthday.

'The past eight months, we have suffered immeasurable sadness - there are no words which can describe the pain and grief we feel.

'We have taken no pleasure from hearing the guilty verdict, or the sentence given today.

'We accept the sentence but in no way feel that justice will be served, as no length of time will ever help us come to terms with what we have lost.

'We are relieved this horrific part of our lives is over and will go home today to begin to grieve for Connor and learn to come to terms with the life sentence that we were given on 11 May. We will never be given parole.

'Our thanks go to all that have helped the family and to convict the accused.'
