These young cubs know how to cross a river in style - they just ride across it bear-back.

The trio of little grizzlies refused to be left behind when their mother went for a paddle in a stream in Katmai National Park, Alaska ... so they clambered onto her back and stayed there until she took them along.

The hilarious photographs were taken by tourist Jon Langeland while on a fishing trip at the reserve last week.

Bear-back: These young cubs know how to cross a river in style - and that's to ride across it bear-back

Take us with you! The trio of little grizzlies refused to be left behind when their mother went for a paddle in a stream in Katmai National Park, Alaska

Stubborn: So rather than wait on the shore for her to come back, they clambered onto her back and stayed there until she took them along

But as soon as he saw the adorable scene, he forgot about his catch and picked up his camera - eager to record this remarkable act of nature.

'The feelings you get when seeing these beautiful animals and their behaviour up close is difficult to describe,' said the 60-year-old dermatologist. 'These cubs melted our hearts and it was touching to see how the mother always looked over her shoulder to be sure they were okay.'

He added: 'The photo where the mother bear stops in the water, stands up with her beloved cubs balancing on her back and looks at us is magical.'

Grizzly bears are protected in this area of the world and feed off salmon and berries in the summer.

Hold on tight: Once on board they clung to their mother's coat as she paddled in the crystal waters of the stream

Magical: He said this photo, 'where the mother bear stops in the water, stands up with her beloved cubs balancing on her back and looks at us is magical'

There is an abundance of beaches around Katmai, giving bears plenty of opportunities to feed and cool off.

Jon, from Oslo, Norway, said: 'These spring cubs - just a few months old - are totally dependent on their mother.

'These two boys and the girl still live mainly on milk from her.

Hang on! When she had cooled herself down, she padded back onto the beach, her three youngsters still hanging on

Clam-tastic: They also tucked in to a seafood spread, including clams that they picked up on the beach

'The little female cub kept very close to her mother most of the time, even hiding between her legs and tried to help with different tasks.

'The two boys were more up for exploring, even hopping in the water themselves.

'The first day the mother went into the water and left them on the shore was amusing - the little ones disliked that a lot. She didn't dare do that again.'
