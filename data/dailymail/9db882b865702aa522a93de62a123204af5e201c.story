Tony Abbott's perceived strong response to the Malaysia Airlines disaster has seen him achieve a ratings boost equal to any since the election campaign.

But Labor is still the most popular party and rival Bill Shorten has also received a boost in support from voters for the bipartisanship he has shown in standing with the Prime Minister in the aftermath of the MH17 tragedy.

Prime Minister Abbott's 12-point jump in net voter satisfaction is his best result in three months, according to the latest Newspoll published by The Australian.

Tony Abbott's perceived strong response to the Malaysia Airlines disaster has seen him achieve a ratings boost

The rise in support for the Prime Minister more than reverses the popularity setback he copped after the delivery of his widely criticised May budget, which saw thousands of people march in capital cities around Australia in protest that it was 'unfair'.

The boost lifts Mr Abbott to equal billing with Opposition Leader Mr Shorten as the nation's preferred leader after 12 weeks on the outer.

Mr Abbott and Mr Shorten have put their usual fights aside during the handling of the MH17 tragedy which killed 298 people, including 37 Australians.

Mr Shorten has echoed the Prime Minister by saying: 'We must see the victims identified, the bodies returned, the police investigation undertaken and those responsible brought to book'.

'If we ever in Australia thought that Australia was a small country far away without a place in global affairs, this illusion has been dispelled.'

While the support for the leaders has risen, the poll also shows there has been almost no change in the standing of the parties in the past fortnight, with the Coalition and Labor both recording a primary vote of 36 per cent.

The Greens hold 12 per cent and the Palmer United Party and the independents sit at 16 per cent.

In the two-party-preferred stakes, Labor still enjoys a lead of 54 per cent to 46 per cent.

Mr Abbott's satisfaction rating has risen five points to 36 per cent while dissatisfaction with him has fallen seven points to 53 per cent.

Newpoll was taken by 1157 people to assess how recent events may have impacted the politician's popularity but the next election will probably not be held until April 2016.
