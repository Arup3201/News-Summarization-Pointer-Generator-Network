Lionel Messi wants Manchester City star and Argentina team-mate Sergio Aguero to join him at Barcelona as he negotiates a new contract at the club.

Messi is close to striking a deal with the Catalan giants but has asked Barcelona to sign Aguero and offer goalkeeper Jose Manuel Pinto a contract renewal.

He is set to earn around £16.5million a year with up to £3m in bonuses and the economic terms are nearly settled upon.

Wanted: Messi is hoping that signing Aguero will help his floundering form at club level

Well-connected Catalan television station TV3 are reporting Messi would like those two sporting conditions to be met too.

Barcelona have endured a terrible season, being knocked out of the Champions League, losing the Copa del Rey final to Real Madrid and potentially their La Liga title too.

Messi and his father Jorge want Barcelona to strengthen and regain their place among Europe’s elite and the club will have to take his suggestions seriously.

Jorge met the club’s general director Antoni Rossich and economic vice-president Javier Faus on Tuesday, when it is believed the signing of Aguero was raised.

It raises the question of how Messi and Aguero could play alongside Brazil star Neymar, who would also expect a first-team berth.

Meanwhile, Messi also wants goalkeeper Pinto to extend his stay at the club.

The pair are close friends and even though Pinto has already told team-mates he is expecting to leave at the end of the season, could now stay if the club sanction it.

Victor Valdes, currently injured, is set to leave on a free transfer in the summer and Marc-Andre Ter Stegen is joining from Borussia Monchengladbach.

Messi’s current contract expires in 2018 but Barcelona constantly try to keep the four-time world player of the year happy.

If he signs the new deal it will be his seventh contract improvement in nine years at Barcelona.

Both Barcelona and Messi want to secure a new deal by the World Cup at the very latest and he could put pen to paper as soon as next week.

Club president Josep Maria Bartomeu previously told Esport3: ‘We are being unfair to Leo. Our club members need to understand that we must take care of Messi.

‘He has made such an important contribution to this club and he will continue to do so. That’s why we have no doubt that he will lead the future of the club.

‘He is young, he is the best player in the world, and we believe in him.’
