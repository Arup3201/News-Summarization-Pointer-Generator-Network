If you thought you were having a rubbish day then spare a thought for the driver of this minivan after she was swamped in garbage when a tractor-trailer overturned on a highway.

Minivan driver Deanna Langston, 37, was taken to hospital with minor injuries along with the trucker Ronnie Lee Crane, 46, following the accident on Thursday in Cherokee County, Georgia. 

Ms Langston's vehicle was barely visible in pictures taken by the local fire department after it was completely buried by bags of trash and other debris. Only the driver door stuck out, apparently where the woman made her escape.

The big truck flipped over because the driver was going too fast through an intersection, according to the Georgia State Highway Patrol

The rig driver was going too fast through an intersection in Canton and flipped over, spilling the load of garbage it was carrying on top of the minivan. The van and the big rig had to be towed following the collision for repair.

Diesel fuel was also spilled across the road and a section of the highway was closed after the accident which took place shortly before 10am on Thursday. 

Both drivers were taken to Northside Hospital-Cherokee with Mr Crane complaining of shoulder pain and Ms Langston suffering from a potential back injury. It is yet unclear whether there will be any charges.

The weather was clear and conditions were dry when the tractor-trailer rolled over, according to a report today provided to MailOnline by the Georgia Highway Patrol. The owner of the truck is the Moreno Trucking Inc.

It appeared as though the female driver had escaped through this door after the accident - as it was basically the only part of the car which remained visible
