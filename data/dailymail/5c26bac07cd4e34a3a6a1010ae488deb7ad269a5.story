Islamic State have released a new propaganda video featuring young boys undertaking military training.

Entitled 'The Blood of Jihad 2', it is the second video in a series revealing life inside the training camps of Islamic State. It was filmed in the IS held province of Nineveh, Iraq.

The highly choreographed video opens with dramatic slow motion shots of a group of young boys firing AK 47s advancing in a line - all are wearing matching military camouflage fatigues and chequered headscarves.

In the newest propaganda film from Isis five boys are shown patrolling in a line - their guns appear oversized in their hands as they move their weapons left to right as if searching for an imaginary enemy (pictured)

The first part of the film, which appears to be shot in soft focus and is set to music, then shows the boys undertaking training in martial arts.  

One of the boys can be seen holding the black flag of Islamic State whilst another of the boys, wearing a headband with a slogan in Arabic, leads the martial arts drill.

The boys stand in five neat lines, carefully holding their formation. Most of the boys look no older than 12 or 13 years old and their uniforms hang loosely off their slim bodies.

The video goes on to show similar scenes to the first video of the series which featured the training of adult IS fighters. 

Some boys are shown holding 'ceramic' slates over their heads and when the order is given each boy slowly takes it in turn to smash their slate over their exposed head - but it smashes surprisingly easily

A bearded adult fighter is shown striking a wooden cane over one of the child soldier's head - but the boy barely flinches, casting doubts over how solid the 'cane' is

A bearded adult fighter, acting as one of the boy's brigade trainers, is shown striking a wooden cane over one of the child soldier's head. 

The cane is shown shattering on impact with the young boy's skull - but the boy barely flinches, casting doubts over how solid the piece of wood really is.

In another highly choreographed scene the teacher is seen moving to another boy, 'punching' repeatedly into his abdomen - despite appearing to barely make contact.

With his his hands held behind his head, the boy withstands the 'punches' before he eventually staggers back.

His teacher then kicks him on the shins and continues to land punches on his stomach whilst the other boys watch on.

Next, ten of the boys are shown forming a two tiered human pyramid.

One of the boys performs a running leap and acrobatically lands on top of the boys. Standing upon their linked arms, the boy steadies himself before triumphantly holding aloft Islamic State's flag.

The video continues to show off the young recruits skills with the next scene showing one of the boys disarming a fellow trainee who is posing as a gunman and successfully demobilising eight other boys through unarmed combat.

When kicked in the shins the boy deftly turns the fall into a cartwheel - again suggesting the video has been very carefully, and heavily, choreographed. 

Despite their dramatic shouts, the boys do not seem to make contact with each other, and each falls carefully to the floor and remains there while the victor makes his way around the circle.

 Such ninja skills are a popular feature of IS training videos, despite most of their soldiers having few opportunities to use ninja skills on the frontline.

The video shows each boy take it in turn to run across the field, dive down behind some sandbags and fire off a few rounds of their AK 47s at the imaginary enemy

Other scenes show the boys undertaking more core training with their teacher, punching and hitting them with wooden sticks. 

Five of the boys are then shown holding 'ceramic' slates over their heads. 

When the order is given by their teacher each boy slowly takes it in turn to smash their slate over their exposed head - but again, the slates smash surprisingly easily, almost on contact.

It would appear the slate is either extremely flimsy or it has been prepared to snap easily.

The video then shows a set of press ups and squats are completed by the group of 30 boys.

Some of the boys are then shown in the press up position as their teacher goes around, 'kicking' each boy in the stomach to see if they collapse onto the ground. 

After receiving the blow with apparent ease, each boy leaps up, dusts themselves off and watches their comrades complete the task.

Gym training is followed by patrolling tactics with machine guns. 

Five boys, wearing chequered headscarves and black tunics are shown cautiously patrolling in a line.

Their guns appear oversized in their small hands as they move their weapons left and right as if they are searching for an imaginary enemy. 

They halt and form a small circle to discuss tactics whilst one of the boys is ordered to break off from the group and run across no man's land towards a steep hill.

Despite the fact the guns do not appear to be loaded, the scene is accompanied by the deafening roar of gunfire and explosions.

Each boy takes it in turn to run across the field, dive down behind some sandbags and fire off a few rounds of their AK 47s at the imaginary enemy.

Two of the boys then race up a steep hill, where they proceed to round up a number of 'prisoners'. 

They lead the prisoners back down the hill, forcing them to keep their hands behind their heads and dragging them by their scarfs with a gun barrel menacingly positioned in their back.

The shocking video finishes with the young recruits taking it in turns to thank each of their teachers, shaking their hands and kissing them on their cheek.
