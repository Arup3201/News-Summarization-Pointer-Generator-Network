This remote property has become an island in a sea of flood water - after its owner spent three years building a 6ft high clay bank to protect it.

Suzette Billington, 71, lives 200 yards from the River Tone on the Somerset Levels and her 150-year-old property used to be flooded nearly every winter.

But, after repeatedly bailing out the house, her late husband Douglas - a former Royal Navy lieutenant - encircled his two-acre garden with a floodbank.

Protection: This property 200 yards from the River Tone on the Somerset Levels was previously regularly flooded until the owner built an earth wall around it

Nowadays: The couple were attracted by the romance of the rural wilderness which flowers into a paradise during summer months

How it used to look: Douglas and Suzette Billington's flood-prone home in Stoke St Gregory, near Taunton, pictured in the 1990s before the flood barrier was built

Now, more than a decade later, the defences are still holding and widowed Mrs Billington is dry as the fields around her are submerged under 3ft of water.

She said today: ‘The defence was my husband’s idea - he decided the beautiful house did not always need to flood.

‘The land has flooded for the past two years and the defence has still held so I’m very grateful for it. I have lots of moral support now I’m on my own.

‘Friends bring me things and helpfully drive me to my car.’

Mrs Billington and her retired husband bought the flood-prone home in Stoke St Gregory, near Taunton, in 1994.

The couple were attracted by the romance of the rural wilderness which flowers into a paradise during summer months.

But each year they paid the price of buying a property which became a lonely island almost every winter.

Flooding
 was so regular that they kept a boat tied up outside the 
living-room window and would have to use it to make the mile-long trip to the 
‘mainland’.

Bright idea: After repeatedly bailing out the house, the late Douglas Billington encircled his two-acre garden with a clay floodbank

Mrs Billington said: ‘What we did was to put about a three metre bank of clay all the way around the property so the water itself does not come into the house or the gardens.’

But the years have taken their toll on the wall and it has sprung a few leaks.

Mrs Billington added: ‘It keeps the water out (but) also keeps it in, so I’m currently pumping out water from where it got in through a few holes.

‘I have two electric pumps and the Environment Agency have been nice enough to lend me another.’

The house has now been marooned for a week and Mrs Billington is being ferried to the ‘mainland’ - where she has left her car - by a friend in a tractor.

‘I have been coming and going with a friend picking me up with a tractor which is working quite well,’ she said. ‘I have been parking my Freelander up on the river bank so I can transfer into that and go about as I wish.’
