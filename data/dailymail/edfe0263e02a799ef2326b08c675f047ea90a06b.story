Pioneer: Lloyd Chamberlain 
Lloyd Chamberlain was one of the first to have the antibiotic cure

One morning four years ago, London businessman Lloyd Chamberlain woke up to find he could not walk. His back had seized up and when he tried to put weight on his right leg, the pain was indescribable.

Any movement could mean agony. It was a level of pain that meant he could not do anything else, and as the days went by there was little sign that it would disappear.

Only after he had lain flat on his back for two weeks did things start marginally to improve.Lloyd, 36, had suffered back trouble periodically since he was 19, when he slipped a disc.

But this time the pain was so intense, the immobility so crippling, that for the first time he was forced to consider surgery, with the attendant risk of paralysis.

Today, in contrast, his outlook could not be more different. His life has been transformed — not by going under the knife, however.

He has benefited from a revolutionary new treatment for serious back pain which involves nothing more than a simple and inexpensive course of antibiotics.

‘It’s been transformational,’ says the sports-mad businessman. ‘I’ve done a lot of things I wouldn’t be able to do at any point in the past ten years. I’ve been skiing in the Arctic, cycled 200km over a weekend in Ibiza and I’m going to enter my first triathlon in the summer.’

Lloyd is one of the first back pain patients in the world to receive antibiotic treatment — a pioneering approach which, say doctors, has the potential to cure hundreds of thousands of Britons from a lifetime of crippling pain.

The treatment was first recommended by scientists in Denmark who discovered that many cases of severe, long-term back pain are caused by bacteria that respond to courses of drugs, which means surgery is not necessary.

The breakthrough is so important that Peter Hamlyn, consultant neurological spinal surgeon at London’s University College hospital, who has successfully used the treatment on  his patients, has described it as ‘the stuff of Nobel prizes’.

It was at the recommendation of his physiotherapist that Lloyd went to see Mr Hamlyn and was given a choice after an MRI scan: he could still consider the surgical option which involved fusing vertebrae together, as well as the risk of paralysis and a year-long rehabilitation; or he could take 100 days of common antibiotic tablets at a cost of £114.

Mr Hamlyn had been introduced to the idea of using antibiotics in 2010 when he was invited to Denmark to witness the work being done by Dr Hanne Albert, a physiotherapist based at the University of Southern Denmark.

He admits he was sceptical at first — ‘a cure for back pain is a bit like the cure for cancer,’ he explains — and went without great enthusiasm.

But by the end of Dr Albert’s presentation, he thought: ‘Actually, that’s pretty startling.’Now, he says: ‘Having treated a number of patients myself, I think it’s extraordinary.

Dr Albert discovered not only that a particular type of infection was the cause of these patients’ pain, but also devised the test to prove it, the pathology and the cure. It’s the work of a Nobel Prize-winner.’

Agony: Four years ago Mr Chamberlain's back pain was so crippling he was considering surgery

‘Even so, I was extraordinarily cautious at the start. To give patients a big dose of antibiotics for 100 days is pretty unheard of, and I was imagining myself being hauled up in front of the medical council.’When Mr Hamlyn put the antibiotic option to his patient, Lloyd, he was keen.

‘Although the prospect of taking three months’ worth was pretty unappealing it seemed like a very low risk alternative,’ he says. ‘What shocked me about the surgical route was that things could go wrong, and at that point my disc had degraded so much fusion was the only option.’

Lloyd looked online for guidance. ‘There were some fairly conflicting reports. But I didn’t think Peter was a madman. I relied on what he told me and didn’t mind becoming what was essentially one of the guinea pigs.

‘There was very little effect for the first two months and then a very noticeable one which continued for six months after I stopped taking the treatment.’

And now, of course, he is able to take part in the sports he so loves. Lloyd had been managing his back problem ever since he tried to lift a double oven while installing a kitchen during his gap year.

‘I immediately felt something give in my back,’ he says. ‘I couldn’t carry my own tool bag home and it wasn’t heavy.

The revolutionary treatment consists of little more than a simple course of antibiotics

‘I went to Cambridge University about a month later and I basically couldn’t do any sport at all in my first year. It was an ongoing problem.

‘I’d hang from the big iron gates of Jesus College and my girlfriend would hang from my feet to try to give my back some traction. I’m not sure that’s medically recommended, but it seemed to help at the time.

‘No one told me I’d got a slipped disc until I had my first MRI scan four years later.’ At last he had an explanation for why he regularly suffered muscle spasms and vibrations in the leg. Why he sometimes couldn’t even stand. But as far as he could see there was no real cure.

It was his agonising case history along with that telling MRI scan taken by Peter Hamlyn which suggested Lloyd was suitable for the treatment.

Mr Hamlyn had become used to seeing a group of patients at his clinic whose back pain was both excruciating and notoriously difficult to fix.

‘The pain takes over their life,’ he explains. ‘It gets worse if they exercise. If they go for a walk, sit down for a meal, try to concentrate on their work, it’s with them all the time.

Painkillers gradually become less and less effective. It then pursues them into the night, so they can’t sleep. ‘It’s completely unbiddable, completely dominating and absolutely relentless.’

The chronic nature of the pain is not surprising given the discovery that the culprit is a bacteria known as proprioni acne, which has been found in high numbers in herniated discs and not at all in healthy discs.

‘The bacteria secrete acid which is wickedly painful. It corrodes the bone and the pain comes from the little micro-fractures of the bone next to the disc,’ says Mr Hamlyn. 

‘These patients are suffering mini-fractures every time they move. So sending them to Pilates — as has been the traditional response —  had hardly been ideal.’

The clue is in the MRI scan. All of the patients in greatest pain seemed to have a tell-tale whitening of their bone next to the troublesome disc. The medical profession’s traditional response had been to ignore it, dismissing it as irrelevant and certainly not painful.

‘I would see these patients and say: “That MRI scan looks really angry,” but I still had no idea what to do with them,’ says Mr Hamlyn.

‘We could try an injection of steroids, which made the pain go away for a while, and then they would come back and say: “It’s terrible,” so they would have a big operation and go back to being OK.

That big operation involved taking out the disc and fusing the bones together, getting rid of the infection coincidentally. It worked. But now it is clear that the infected disc can also be treated with antibiotics.

There remain two big concerns for the
proponents of this new treatment regime. One is the indiscriminate use 
of antibiotics for lower back pain when only a certain group should be 
targeted.

While
four of five of us in Britain will experience back pain at some point 
in our lives, only 20 per cent of those suffer from what is known as 
‘chronic lower back pain’. Of that number, approximately 40  per cent are estimated to suffer from this bacterial disease of the discs.

The treatment has the potential to cure hundreds of thousands of Britons from a lifetime of crippling pain

The treatment could prove highly controversial at a time when the chief medical officer has been warning that new ‘superbugs’ could pose a ‘dire’ threat to health following the over-prescription of antibiotics.

Given that sufferers make seven million GP visits annually to discuss their back pain, and the NHS spends a staggering £1 billion a year treating it, the pressure on local surgeries to dispense antibiotics to all-comers will have to be resisted.

‘You just have to do it properly,’ says Mr Hamlyn. ‘You need a specialist’s confirmation that your patient does indeed have the disease, you have to have the right scan which has to be looked at by a radiologist who knows what they’re doing, and you have to ensure the patient takes the full-course of antibiotics rather than just a little bit. The answer to this is education.

‘The second risk is that the medical community has a fantastic ability to ignore advances,’ he adds. ‘The trial does need to be repeated in more than one country and we need more research into the dose of antibiotic and how long it should be taken to make the treatment even more effective.

‘But I have absolutely no doubt of the importance of this discovery.’Lloyd, for one, will testify to that,

‘Before the treatment I had to make choices all the time  about what I could and couldn’t do,’ he says. ‘I had to carry my back around like a burden. Now I don’t have to compromise at all.

‘It’s eliminated the worry for the first time in my adult life.’

And the extraordinary truth is that so many sufferers of crippling back pain could well be endorsing that view in the future.
