A video has captured a manâ€™s final moments as he was swept off a jetty by a giant wave.

The 43-year-old, from Senegal, died after being swept into the ocean in Onadarroa, northern Spain.

Dramatic footage shows the man walking alone in wild weather conditions when waves begin to come over the top of the jetty.

At the last moment, he realises the danger and attempts to turn and run from the power of the sea.

But it is too late and he is swept away by the water.

The Red Cross managed to retrieve the man from the ocean and performed CPR on him, but he later died at the scene, reported El Pais.

Video of the tragedy has been posted on YouTube. It comes just days after a woman was filmed dancing on a Spanish beach as waves pounded the shoreline.

She too was swept away but survived after being cast up further down the beach.
