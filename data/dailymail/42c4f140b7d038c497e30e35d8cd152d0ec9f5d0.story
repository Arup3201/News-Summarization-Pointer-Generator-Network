An overweight shepherdess who kept being outrun by her sheep can now keep up with the flock after losing six stone.

Sadie James, 39, tipped the scales at 20st after years of eating rich dairy products like cheese.

Her weight meant she found it difficult to herd her 62 pedigree sheep and often ended up out of breath when chasing after them.

She embarked on a diet last year and after reigning in her love of cheese, she has dropped from a size 28 to a size 14.

Sadie, from Melplash, near Beaminster, Dorset, is now a healthy 13st 8lbs and has been nicknamed the Real Slim Sadie by friends.

She said: 'I breed and show a flock of pedigree sheep as a hobby and when they had lambs in the spring they used to outrun me.  

'I haven’t got a sheepdog so I have round them up myself but I would look really silly because I couldn’t keep up with them, especially the lambs.

'I started putting on weight in my teens because I was eating the wrong things like lots of cheese and milk.

'In my late teens I started getting teased at school about my size and I was just known as the large, jolly one.

'I joined Slimming World once and lost about two stone but I didn’t have the motivation to keep it up, so I put the weight back on and more.

'The maximum weight I reached was about 20st and I started having health problems so my GP offered to put me on an NHS-funded diet plan for 12 weeks.

'This time I saw it through and I have got down to 13st 8lbs.

Sadie can now keep up with the demand of the flock after losing an incredible 6st on an NHS funded 12 week diet

'I met my husband when I started putting on the weight and by the time we got married I was much larger. Looking back at pictures, I look like a sack of spuds on my wedding day.

'I now look in the mirror and often don’t recognise myself and I’m still getting used to being slimmer.

'The hardest thing to cut back on has definitely been cheese and milk, I used to milk cows so the temptation to have a bit of milk was very hard to resist.'
