A murderer who dodged prison for 17 years after stabbing a man to death in London has been jailed.

Kiranjit Uppal, 37, fled the UK after Harminder Singh Jhaghra, 28, was killed in Hayes, west London, during a gang feud in 1996.

Uppal had been living a 'relatively comfortable life' in India before he was arrested in September last year after boarding a flight to Heathrow, Isleworth Crown Court heard.

The court was told that Mr Jhaghra died after Uppal stabbed him in the arm, which severed an artery, causing him to bleed to death.

A night of attacks on February 7, 1996, began after two associates of Uppal, from the Cranford area of Hayes, were beaten up by another gang from the Southall area.

Despite receiving only cuts and bruises, word quickly spread about the attack, and a large group of Cranford men met up and made their way to a minicab office in Southall.

Once there, the group - which included Uppal - attacked a 15-year-old boy who was playing an arcade game. The boy was left with severe cuts to his head, and a broken elbow.

Mr Jhaghra was called about the attack and made his way to the minicab office, and after several phone calls between the two groups, the men agreed to meet in a nearby car park.

Some of the Cranford men, armed with weapons, hid in bushes nearby, while another group stayed behind as bait.

After the Southall men arrived, they were lured to the bushes before the group holding weapons jumped them. During that fight, Mr Jhaghra was stabbed in the arm.

A group of men, including Mr Jhaghra, were lured to this wooded area of Watersplash Lane where another group, including Uppal, ambushed them

He managed to flag down a passing motorist and was taken to hospital, but later died.

In their haste to get away, some of the Cranford group discarded weapons and clothing, some of which was linked by DNA evidence to Uppal, though the murder weapon was never recovered.

Uppal, of no fixed address, was found guilty of murder at Isleworth Crown Court on Monday. Today, he was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years in prison.

Detective Chief Inspector Charles King said: 'For almost 18 years Uppal thought he had got away with murdering Harminder Singh Jhaghra and had been living a relatively comfortable life in India.

'Today's sentence should send a strong message that, even with the passage of time, we will do all that we can to find those who insist on evading justice and put them before the courts.

'The events of that fateful day have left a profound effect on Harminder's family. They have had to wait 18 long years to witness this day and I would like to thank them for supporting us with this trial.

'I hope that the sentence handed down today provides them some measure of justice after such a considerable period of time.'
