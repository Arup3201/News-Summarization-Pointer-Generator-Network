New York’s fire service is not doing enough to cut down on discrimination against black people and other minorities in its recruiting, a judge claimed.

The Fire Department of New York (FDNY) has not committed enough time or resources to reverse a long history of discrimination, he said.

Judge Nicholas Garaufis made the damning comments about the FDNY in a memorandum after a civil trial in Brooklyn, New York.

The U.S. Justice Department had sued the city on behalf of a fraternal organisation for black firemen called the Vulcan Society.

Judge Garaufis praised the city’s efforts to sign up record numbers for an exam but pushed for a lasting solution, reported the New York Daily News.

The fire department had announced this summer that nearly half of the people who had signed up for its next exam were minorities.

But only around three per cent of New York City firemen are black. Judge Garaufis is expected to spell out a remedy in a separate ruling.

His ruling that the Vulcan Society of black firemen had proven its claims means a court-ordered monitor is now likely to oversee any changes, reported the New York Daily News.

Judge Garaufis wrote that ‘the underrepresentation of black firefighters in the FDNY’ is ‘a direct result and vestige’ of the city’s discrimination.

He added that this is ‘responsible for making blacks significantly less likely to’ work in the FDNY, without a formal recruitment programme.

A city spokesman told NY1: ‘We respectfully disagree with some of the court's findings and are continuing to study this lengthy 81-page decision.

'The next steps the city will take depend on what the judge's subsequent rulings are regarding remedial steps.’

'Whether it's systemic, whether it's intentional, whether someone didn't know they were doing it - they still broke the law,' Vulcan Society president John Coombs told NY1.

Former human resources official Sherry Kavaler testified in court that white candidates with difficult pasts can often get in thanks to family links.
