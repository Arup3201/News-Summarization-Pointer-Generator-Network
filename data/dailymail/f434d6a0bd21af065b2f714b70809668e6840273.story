More than two decades after Magic Johnson announced that he had HIV, the basketball player says he is still surprised at the impact the news had.

The former Los Angeles Lakers player said when he was first told he had HIV he was convinced he was going to die, but advances in drugs has helped Johnson - and millions of others - survive.

Johnson, who became the face of HIV/Aids 22 years ago, is now campaigning for more people to get tested for the disease, especially those in black or Hispanic communities.

'We have to drive people to get tested, 
because that's the most important thing,' he told CBS News. 'The stigma and fear
of knowing their status' is holding people back.

Johnson admitted that when his team's doctor told him blood results had revealed he had HIV in 1991 he was 'devastated'.

'At that time, people were really dying of Aids. I was just scared to death,' he said.

The NBA star began treatment with Dr Michael Mellman and Dr David Ho, a top HIV researcher, who reassured him that newly developed drugs would improve his chance of survival.

But it was a meeting with Aids activist Elizabeth Glaser who helped Johnson come to terms with the diagnosis, and influenced his decision to publicly campaign to raise awareness.

Johnson said that Glaser, whose HIV had developed to Aids, was able to answer questions from him and his wife Cookie, who was two months' pregnant at the time, about living with the disease.

'The one thing she did say was I was 
going to live for a long time. And the thing that she asked me to do was
become the face of the disease,' he said.

'She felt it was really 
important that I go public to help a lot of other people who were living
the same lifestyle who didn’t know they had HIV and needed to get 
tested ... And she was absolutely right.'

His wife, Cookie, who tested negative 
along with their son, told the Huffington Post: 'For us, it was super 
hard. That was back in the day, in 1991, when people were dying at 
alarming rates. That was when people didn’t know anything about the 
disease, so it was very frightening.'

The couple have been leading advocates for HIV awareness, and Johnson recently campaigned in Harlem's Apollo Theater to raise awareness about the high rates of the disease in black and Hispanic communities.

Despite representing only 12 per cent 
of the population, black Americans account for about 44 per cent of new 
HIV infections each year. They are also more likely to die from the 
disease.

Hispanic Americans are also more 
likely to die from HIV than white Americans. According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, Hispanics make up 21 per cent of new 
infections each year.

Overall, about 1.1 million Americans are living 
with HIV, according to federal estimates, with almost one in five 
unaware of their infection.

'In the black community, unfortunately, 
we’re still in denial that it can happen to us. We haven’t done a 
wonderful job of raising the awareness level or educating our people. 
Its gotten better since I announced 22 years ago, but it needs to get 
much better,' he said.

His campaign earlier this month was to raise awareness about Orasure’s OraQuick at-home HIV test. The event was held in the run up to World Aids Day on December 1.
