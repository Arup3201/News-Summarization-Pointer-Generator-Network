Kevin Pietersen’s Australian adventure came to an end here in Perth on Sunday but not before he provided one vintage glimpse of the talent that made him one of England’s greatest batsmen.

Pietersen’s Kevin Pietersen bowed out of the Australian Big Bash when they were defeated by Perth Scorchers in the semi-final of a competition that has showcased much of what is good in modern Twenty20 cricket.

Yet Pietersen gave an Australian public that has warmed to him something to remember with a switch-hit for six that conjured up memories of his prime before everything went so badly wrong with England.

‘That’s the shot of the tournament,’ cooed commentator Damien Fleming as Pietersen hit left-arm wrist spinner Brad Hogg for a six that was measured at 86 metres and for a moment we were transported back to Durham seven years ago when Pietersen unveiled his extraordinary left-handed hit against Scott Styris.

It was not enough for Melbourne as, with Perth turning the screw, Pietersen was unable to conjure up the match-winning performance so much of Australia would have welcomed with the England side that spurned him also in town.

So it was Perth, complete with another discarded England batsman in Michael Carberry, who thrilled the capacity crowd at the WACA – or The Furnace as it is known for the Big Bash – by reaching Wednesday’s final against Sydney.

Pietersen was out for 31 off 27 balls as Melbourne failed to reach Perth’ s 144 and was unable to add a decisive contribution to the three half centuries that have made him one of the outstanding performers of the tournament.

Melbourne fell 20 short of that to the delight of a Perth crowd who provided another glowing reference for a competition that has provided a template for England to follow if the new regime at the ECB are brave enough to implement it.

To watch Pietersen on Sunday was to be reminded of something I wrote this time last year when England decided that enough was enough and they should rebuild without a gifted player who became more trouble than he was worth.

It is possible, I said, to be sad about the sacking of Pietersen while also firmly believing it is the right decision and that is as true today as it was when the wounds were raw even though he has sparkled in this year’s Big Bash.

Nobody doubted that Pietersen was still capable of the odd flash of genius and it will be hugely satisfying to him that he has shown that here after being released by both Surrey and Delhi in the aftermath of his England demotion.

It was a wicked twist of fate that brought Pietersen here the day after England arrived to take on India in the tri-series but there was to be no fairytale script for him, with Peter Moores ensconced in a hotel barely a switch hit away.

Instead Perth and Hampshire’s Carberry hit a decisive half century to show Moores that Pietersen is not the only ex-England batsman in the Big Bash nursing a grievance and anxious to prove a point.

So Pietersen has, to a large extent, proved here that he can defy the flickering flame of his talent for a little while yet and continue earning a lucrative living around the world while trying to provide more embarrassment for England.

But what happens next to him will be fascinating. He admitted here on Saturday when he talked enthusiastically and with much cricketing sense that he will have to give his next move some ‘serious thought.’

Sportsmail understands that Surrey have no intention of re-signing him so it is possible he has played in English cricket for the last time, particularly with the ECB’s surprise move last week to reduce the counties salary cap.

If he was really serious about proving to England that he is still good and committed enough to play for them again, of course, he should knuckle down and play first-class cricket again, irrespective of the size of the pay-packet.

His friend Matt Maynard may be inclined give him the chance to do that now he has become Somerset’s coach but if, as expected, Pietersen would prefer to cash in on Twenty20 riches in India and the Caribbean then everyone should just accept that England are moving on without him. And enjoy any glimpses of his still rare ability when they are provided, as was briefly the case yesterday.

It must certainly be hoped that Colin Graves, expected to be made new chairman of the ECB, and new chief executive Tom Harrison have been watching Sky’s coverage of this excellently marketed and hyped tournament.

The Big Bash has proved that franchise cricket, watched by big crowds paying very reasonable prices, in a short sharp event can work, even though standards are not noticeably better than England’s much derided NatWest Blast.

Franchise cricket has been kept at arm’s length by nervous counties up to now but if England are to reclaim the bragging rights in the format they gave to the world then it really should be considered by the ECB’s new broom.

That would be something that Pietersen would approve of English cricket’s governing body doing.
