Damning: BBC staff turned a blind eye to up to 1,000 allegations of child rape and sexual assault by Jimmy Savile, according to a review published next month

BBC staff disregarded up to 1,000 allegations of child rape and sexual assault on the corporation's premises by predatory DJ Jimmy Savile, according to a damning review published next month.

The inquiry, led by Dame Janet Smith, will also claim that the true number of Savile's victims may never be known and that BBC executives were aware of the allegations, but consistently failed to take any action against the late Top Of The Pops presenter.

While due for publication this month, Smith's report has been delayed until February due to the large number of victim testimonies being examined.

An unnamed source close to the inquiry told The Observer that the report's conclusions will overshadow the investigation led by Nick Pollard, former head of Sky News, which sought to uncover why the BBC dropped its Newsnight programme on the Savile allegations.

The source said: 'It will go right to the heart of how Savile was able to get away with the most heinous of crimes under the very noses of BBC staff for more than 40 years.'

Smith, a former court of appeal judge, will also highlight the sheer scale of BBC employees who knew about Savile's behaviour, as well as his colleague, Stuart Hall, but remained silent.

Peter Saunders, chief executive of 
the National Association for People Abused in Childhood described the potential
findings in Smith's report as 'very sad'.

He said: 'You think, 'Oh my God, these people were offending almost in open sight and no-one thought to intervene.'

Liz Dux, a lawyer from Slater & Gordon, who is representing 74 of Savile's victims, added: 'This will not be a what-the-BBC-want sort of report.'

Smith, who led the inquiry into GP and serial killer Harold Shipman, is reported to have sent letters to every member of BBC staff past and present asking for witnesses to Savile's crimes.

More than 1,000 victims and witnesses, including 138 who are pursuing civil claims for compensation, have also been helping the inquiry.

Prolific: Police say Savile attacked more than 1,000 victims over 54 years, including at the age of 84 on the last ever Top of the Pops

Police investigations have so far uncovered that at least 450 people were abused by the Jim'll Fix It presenter on BBC premises.

They also say at least 1,300 people were attacked by him over the course of 54 years.

Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, is said to have carried out most of the attacks in the 1960s and 1970s, when his popularity as a BBC presenter was at its peak.

However, aged 79 he groped a teenage girl while filming the last Top of the Pops.

Described as Britain's worst ever paedophile, Savile's abuse also took place on NHS premises, prompting a further review expected later this year.

Abuse of trust: Savile with patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, which is also investigating claims of sexual assault

Over the years, Savile used his high-profile position to abuse patients at hospitals across the country, including Broadmoor, at which he had an office and living quarters and Leeds General Infirmary, where he was given widespread access.

In a 2009 interview with police, Savile even boasted that he ‘owned’ the NHS hospital at Stoke Mandeville and said he brushed off girls ‘like midges’.

Limited compensation will be available to Savile's victims through a scheme being agreed by the BBC, the NHS and the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust.

However, Dux hopes the BBC will increase the compensation available to his victims once Smith's findings are published.
