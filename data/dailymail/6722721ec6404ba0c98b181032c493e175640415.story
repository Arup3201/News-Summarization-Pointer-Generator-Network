After 15 months in orbit the U.S Air Force’s highly secret unmanned space plane successfully touched down yesterday, and it’s highly anticipated landing was caught on film.

The military's unmanned X-37B robotic space shuttle returned from orbit at 5:48 a.m. in California from a secretive test flight.

And now officials from the Vandenberg Air Force Base have released a short video of the smooth landing.

The first part of the 1.17 minute video, which captured the plane’s final descent, is shot in infrared light.

The
 miniature space plane touched down at California's Vandenberg Air Force
 Base, 130 miles northwest of Los Angeles. It was only the second U.S. 
vehicle to make an autonomous runway landing from space.

The space plane, also known as Orbital Test Vehicle-2, or OTV-2, fired its engine to slip
 out of orbit, then pierced through the atmosphere and glided down the 
runway  - just as an ordinary airplane would.

'With the retirement of the space 
shuttle fleet, the X-37B OTV program brings a singular capability to 
space technology development,' said Lieutenant Colonel Tom McIntyre, 
X-37B program manager.

'The return capability allows the Air Force to 
test new technologies without the same risk commitment faced by other 
programs. We're proud of the entire team's successful efforts to bring 
this mission to an outstanding conclusion.'

The military's first X-37B debuted
 in 2010 and autonomously landed at Vandenberg after 224 days in space.

Smooth landing: The unmanned Air Force space plane steered itself to a landing early Saturday capping a 15-month clandestine mission

This computer image shows the space plane re-entering Earth. Although it resembles a small space shuttle it is not designed to carry humans. It's wingspan is a mere 4.5m with a length of 8.9m. It is powered by batteries and solar cells

The former Soviet Union's Buran space shuttle, which made a single 
spaceflight in 1988, was the first ship to make an autonomous landing 
from orbit.

The military will not disclose 
what OTV-2 was doing during its 15 months in orbit, but a third mission 
already is on the calendar for launch this fall. OTV-2 blasted off 
aboard an unmanned Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station 
on March 5, 2011.

At 
launch, the space plane was accompanied by staff in biohazard suits, 
leading to speculation that there were radioactive components on board.

Boeing Phantom Works built two of the robotic space planes, which resemble diminutive space shuttle orbiters, as test vehicles.

The military, which took over the 
program from NASA, says it is using them to learn how to quickly and 
inexpensively refurbish reusable spaceships for flight.

However, the ultimate purpose of the mission has largely remained a mystery.

Questions: The unmanned space plane is the second of its kind to be sent up by the U.S. Air Force - but its purpose has never fully been explained

Finishing touches: Scientists in protective suits inspect the solar-powered craft prior to its mission

The top-secret robot plane is expected to land Saturday - weather and technical issues permitting

The X-37Bs also 
serve as orbital test beds for instruments that could be incorporated 
into future satellites.

It is not known if it carried anything in its cargo bay, which is about the size of a pickup truck bed.

The vehicles look like miniature 
versions of NASA's now-retired space shuttle orbiters, with a similar 
shape and a payload bay for cargo and experiments.

They are 8.9 metres 
long, compared to the shuttle's 37-metre length, and have a 
wingspan of 4.5 metres, compared to the shuttle's wingspan of 23.7 meters.

The solar-operated vehicles were designed to 
stay in orbit for up to 270 days. OTV-2 surpassed that milestone by 199 
days.

The X-37B due to fly this fall is the vehicle that inaugurated the program in 2010,'

However, many skeptics think that the vehicle's mission is defence or spy-related.

There
 are rumours circulating that the craft was kept in space longer than 
initially intended to spy on the new Chinese space station, Tiangong.

However, analysts have pointed out 
that surveillance would be tricky, since the spacecraft would rush 
past each other at thousands of metres per second.

And Brian Weeden, from the Secure World
 Foundation, pointed out to the BBC: ‘If the U.S. really wanted to 
observe Tiangong, it has enough assets to do that without using X-37B.’

Mystery:  Scientists work on a prototype for the rocket prior to its launch

Last May, amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first X-37B which

 included flyovers of North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan,
 heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for 
surveillance.

Other industry analysts have 
speculated that the Air Force is just making use of the X-37B’s amazing 
fuel efficiency and keeping it in space for as long as possible to show 
off its credentials and protect it from budget cuts.

After all, under budget cuts for 2013 to 2017 proposed by the Obama administration, the office that developed 
the X-37 will be shut down.

According
 to X-37B manufacturer Boeing, the space plane operates in low-earth 
orbit, between 110 and 500 miles above earth. By comparison, the 
International Space Station orbits at about 220 miles.
