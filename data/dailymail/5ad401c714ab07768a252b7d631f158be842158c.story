To be a competent radio newsreader takes a particular skill and talent but for Nas Campanella it is even more challenging with the hurdles of a vision impairment and little sensitivity in her fingertips.

The 26-year-old, from Sydney, has an inconceivable four streams of audio feeding through her headphones during the three-minute live news bulletins on Triple J which would be enough for anyone to throw in the towel. 

But Campanella, who also writes and cuts her own segments, reads the live reports effortlessly like a true professional despite not being able to read braille due to her condition.

Despite a vision impairment and little sensitivity in her fingertips, Nas Campanella is a newsreader at Triple J

Campanella did a 12-month post in in Bombala, in rural NSW, before landing a cadetship at the ABC

She lost her vision at six months old and then diagnosed with a condition preventing her from reading braille

To help make the magic happen - Campanella uses a laptop with speech software where whatever she types and anything the mouse scans over is read out to her.

The four different streams of audios when live on radio is a voice telling her what to say during the bulletin, her voice throughout the microphone reading out the news, the grabs that have been packaged before going to air, and finally a clock telling her exactly when to start and finish.

'It has taken the better part of four years to get it down pat and it's still not perfect - I can hear a voice telling me what to say so I listen and read at the same time, ' she tells Daily Mail Australia.

'I've got to be careful not to lag too far behind - it's got to be a split second after I hear it that I say it -so it's not a perfect system but it works quite well for the most part.' 

Needless to say by the end of a long working week, her ears need a well-earned rest from the sensory overload describing the experience as constantly stuck in 'busy traffic'.

'There is a lot going on and at the end of the week I feel like I need some quiet time,' she said.

At just six months old, blood vessels burst in the back of her eyes which caused them to detach from the retina leaving her with only vision of shadow and light.

To add to her difficulties, Campanella struggled to grasp reading braille until it was discovered when she was ten years old that she has Charcot Marie Tooth - a delayed sensitivity in the hands and feet due to the nerve endings.

'It was frustrating before being diagnosed because there was an assumption that I was lazy or not very intelligent,' she said. 

'It takes a second for my hand to register it's on a kettle that is hot or I will be walking along sand that is really hot but it might take my feet a little while to register.'

Campanella has always wanted to be a journalist since she was a child when she read newspapers

Campanella insists she would still be the same driven personality if she had her sight but admits her impairment has pushed her to be that bit stronger.

'To a certain extent I think fundamentally I'm a pretty determined, enthusiastic, pushy person anyway so I don't think that has really changed because of my vision impairment, she said. 

'But I've obviously had a lot more to prove than other people had when they approached employers for a job.'

When Campanella first started looking for work while still at university she was met with a lot of negativity from potential employers.

Her tactic was she wouldn't mention in her application that she was visually impaired but would explain her situation if she received a call back.

'The fact that I have a vision impairment is nothing to me - there's no reason why I shouldn't be looked at but it's something that other people have found a bit confronting so it's nice to be able to get people come around to the idea,' she said.

A keen jetsetter, Campanella's dream job would be to work as a travel writer

Thanks to great persistence it only took Campanella six months to look for a full time job when she landed a cadetship at the ABC in 2011 and has never looked back.

Following her 12-month training across all mediums, she was sent to do regional post in Bega, in rural NSW, for a year before landing a role as a newsreader with Triple J. 

Although she finds it surprising that people see her as an inspiration - she happily takes on that role.

'I became a journalist because it's what I love to do but it's also nice to know I can help break that mould and hopefully get other people with disabilities employed as well, she said.

She has always wanted to be a reporter since she was a child when she loved reading the newspaper. 

A keen jetsetter, Campanella's dream job would be to work as a travel writer which some people might question as she can't describe what she is seeing on her adventures.

'Using vision as a form of travel is narrow way of looking at things,' she said. 

'You can describe the food you ate, the kindness of the people, the smells around you and the feeling of the sand on your feet.'
