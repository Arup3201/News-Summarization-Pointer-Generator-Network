A Liberal Democrat MEP has been severely condemned by Nick Clegg for a ‘sick and offensive’ tweet saying terrorists had won a victory against David Cameron over the Algerian hostage crisis.

Sir Graham Watson, who represents the south west of England in the European Parliament, took to Twitter to say: ‘Al Qaeda 1, @David_Cameron 0’.

It was a reference to the Prime Minister’s decision late last night to cancel a much-trailed speech in Amsterdam on Britain’s future in Europe, so he could be in Downing Street to deal with the unfolding hostage situation.

Lib Dem MEP Sir Graham Watson sparked a furious reaction with his tweet, and was heavily criticised by party leader Nick Clegg

Provocative: Sir Graham Watson's Tweet which mocked the Prime Minister for postponing his speech to focus on rescuing British nationals from Algeria

Sir Graham, a former aide to ex-Liberal leader David Steel, was forced to apologise after Mr Clegg reprimanded him for the tweet, which a party spokesman said was ‘wholly inappropriate and offensive.’

Mr Clegg was ‘furious’, the spokesman said. ‘It's clearly sick and offensive and is utterly condemned by Nick Clegg.’

Users of Twitter called for Sir Graham’s resignation over the ‘disgusting’ message.

Last night Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘This tweet is revealing. It shows what the federalist fanatics really think.

‘They are so obsessed about protecting their great European project, that they can’t even see common sense.’

The offensive tweet was an apparent jibe at Mr Cameron's decision to postpone his planned trip to Amsterdam, where he was due to deliver a long-awaited speech on Europe yesterday morning.

Instead of being in Amsterdam to deliver his speech, Mr Cameron left Downing Street this morning to deliver a statement on Algeria in the Commons, with chief of staff Ed Llewellyn

But late on Thursday, the speech was postponed so Mr Cameron could stay in Downing Street to deal with the hostage crisis in Algeria.

Speaking to the BBC, Sir Graham defended his tweet. ‘It's a great shame that the prime minister has postponed the speech that he's allowed to become so over-hyped,’ he said.

But later, he sent another tweet, saying: ‘I wish to apologise profusely for the insensitive tweet I issued earlier. I have taken it down.’

Sir Graham represents south-west England and Gibraltar in the European Parliament. He is also president of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, which consists of more than 50 liberal parties from across Europe.

The Scottish-born son of a Royal Navy officer and a teacher served as head of the then Liberal leader David Steel’s private office between 1983 and 1987.

The offensive tweet was sent at a highly-sensitive moment in the hostage crisis, amid reports up to 30 foreign hostages are dead after a helicopter air strike by Algerian forces on the BP gas plant seized by Al Qaeda-linked terrorists led by veteran jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar (pictured)

He then worked for HSBC in their London and Hong Kong offices for six years, before becoming the first Lib Dem to be elected to the European Parliament.

In October 2011, the father-of-two was knighted in the Queen’s birthday honours. On his website he boasts of being able to speak four European languages, and that he is currently learning Mandarin Chinese.

His tweet attracted anger on Twitter. Conservative blogger and broadcaster Iain Dale said Sir Graham was a ‘disgrace’, adding: ‘What a disgusting thing to do.’

Twitter user @Biltawulf wrote: ‘Unelectable insensitive idiot. You just turned people's families into a football score.’

And @hughbs, tweeted: ‘Sorry, apology not accepted. You have revealed just how petty and self-serving you really are. Hope electorate will judge.’

Last night a Labour source said: ‘He’s been incredibly stupid. It was right that he apologised, and he should be more cautious in future.’
