David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have signed a joint declaration that promises more financial powers for Scotland if it rejects independence.

The move by the leaders of the three main parties is an attempt to rubbish claims by Alex Salmond that Westminster will not deliver more devolution if Scots vote ‘no’.

It comes ahead of tonight's TV debate between Scottish First Minister Mr Salmond and Alistair Darling, the former Labour Chancellor who fronts the pro-union Better Together campaign.

The three leaders of the main parties - David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband - pictured yesterday at a service to commemorate 100 years since the outbreak of World War One, have signed a joint declaration of more financial powers for Scotland if they reject independence

There are just over six weeks to go until voters in Scotland decide whether to remain in the UK or become an independent nation in the September 18 referendum.

Polls have so far failed to show a majority in favour of independence, but both campaigns are hoping to receive a boost as a result of tonight’s TV debate. The six leaders’ declaration states: ‘We support a strong Scottish Parliament in a strong United Kingdom.

‘We now pledge to strengthen further the powers of the Scottish Parliament, in particular in the areas of fiscal responsibility and social security.’

Currently, control over council tax and business rates means the Scottish Government raises about 15 per cent of its £30billion budget, with the majority of public spending funded by a block grant from the UK Treasury.

The LibDems have the most radical vision for further devolution, proposing to hand over full control of inheritance tax, capital gains tax, income tax and a good share of corporation tax. Holyrood, the  Scottish Parliament, would then control 60 per cent of  its revenue.

Labour has proposed increasing the figure to 40 per cent, although experts dispute their calculations. They want members of the Scottish Parliament to have control of a 15p share of the basic 20p rate of income tax, and be able to increase higher bands – but not lower them unless all levels are reduced.

Tory proposals would allow full control over all rates of income tax, with the block grant from Westminster reduced accordingly.

VAT levels must remain the same under EU rules, but a share of the revenue from Scotland would be controlled  by Holyrood.

Scottish MPs would also be allowed to ‘supplement’ welfare benefits, while housing benefit could be devolved. If around half of the VAT revenue from Scotland was allocated to Holyrood, the parliament would be responsible for more than 50 per cent of its budget.

Blair McDougall, campaign director for the Better Together campaign, said: ‘Voters in Scotland have been listening to the independence debate for over two years now.

‘Surely if Alex Salmond had convincing answers on the details of separation, we would have heard them by now.’

He added: ‘The referendum debate isn’t confined to TV studios. It is taking place in conversations between friends and family across Scotland.

‘The biggest debate is taking place on the doorsteps, around kitchen tables and in workplaces across the country.

‘And the more people talk about what leaving the UK would mean for our schools and hospitals, the more they are saying no thanks to separation.’

Yes Scotland chief executive Blair Jenkins said: ‘Independence is the opportunity of a lifetime for the people  of Scotland.

'We know Scotland is one of the richest countries in the world, wealthier than the UK, France and Japan, and only the powers offered by a ‘yes’ vote will enable us to make this wealth work better for everyone in Scotland.’
