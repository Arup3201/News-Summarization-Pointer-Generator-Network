The sprawling Tuscan estate where Tony Blair and his family holidayed at has been seized as the aristocrat owner allegedly faces a fraud inquiry.

It is understood that Prince Girolamo Strozzi is being investigated along with others about claims that public funds were misused for two local newspapers.

The Florence University law professor, who belongs to one of Northern Italy's oldest noble families, repeatedly welcomed the Blairs to the magnificent villa.

The Fattoria di Cusona estate, which boasts 1,300 acres and a 16th century mansion, has been in the nobleman's family since 1524.

But it is understood that it has been seized by an Italian magistrate as part of a probe into how government subsidiaries  were used between 2002 and 2011 in relation to two newspapers.

Mr Strozzi's lawyer said that the 75-year-old denies any wrong-doing, The Times reported.

The aristocrat was chairman on the Societa Toscana di Edizioni board for the Il Giornale della Toscana, The Times said.

He, with 21 others, are now under investigation for allegedly manipulating circulation figures and costs, so that the publication would eligible for government subsidies worth around £16.2 million), The Daily Telegraph reported.

Another local newspaper, Metropoli Day, is also alleged to have received €10 million in unwarranted subsidies.

Last month the assets of those involved were allegedly frozen.

According to the reports, Mr Strozzi's lawyer said that his client was challenging the seizure of the estate.

The region was until recently a favourite holiday destination of Tony Blair, and 'Tuscan Tony' was regularly under fire for accepting free stays in villas during his time as Prime Minister.

When the Blairs visited the area, they stayed with Italian aristocrat Prince Girolamo Strozzi. During one free stay on an estate near Pisa, Mr Blair was accused by locals of being a 'scrounger' after he left a paltry tip during a dinner at a restaurant.

In return, official figures show that Prince Strozzi has twice been a weekend dinner guest at Mr Blair's publicly subsidised country residence.

In each case, the invitations to Chequers came just months after the Blairs had stayed at their Italian friend's estate near San Gimignano.

The prince's daughters Natalia, a ballet dancer, and Irina have been regular guests at No10.

Natalia once said: 'The Blairs are so sweet they treat me like one of their children.'

No one was available to comment for Mr Blair when the MailOnline contacted them.
