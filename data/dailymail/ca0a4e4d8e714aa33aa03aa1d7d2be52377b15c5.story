Official World Cup partner Visa has been condemned for allowing touts to use its payment service to sell England tickets at more than ten times their face value.

Fifa has vowed to clamp down on World Cup touts – already illegal in the UK – yet Visa, one of only six ‘global partner’ firms for the 2014 tournament in Brazil, rakes in fees every time such a ticket is bought using one of their cards from shady websites.

We found one ticket with a face value of £47 for England’s match against Uruguay being offered for £676.

Thousands of fans risk being turned away from matches if they buy tickets through unofficial vendors, but The Mail on Sunday found firms on the internet brazenly offering illicitly obtained tickets at up to 14 times the face value.

Our investigation found the internet is flooded with websites offering inflated prices for England’s games, all of which are now sold out on the official Fifa website.

Many of the tickets are believed to have originally been allocated to sponsors, partners and officials, but resold for a profit in strict breach of Fifa’s rules – and Brazilian law.

Instead of cod and chips, England’s fans 
in Manaus will be able to try deep-fried tambaqui, an Amazonian fish – 
and member of the piranha family.

will be sold in paper cones for £2 – his blessing when he visited Manaus

Viagogo, founded in London and now based in Switzerland, is offering top category 1 tickets with a face value equivalent of £91 for England’s match with Costa Rica on June 24 in Belo Horizonte for as much as £974 – a  mark-up of more than 1,000 per cent.

The tickets appear along with category 3 tickets – £47 at face value – for the game against Uruguay on June 19 for as much as £676.

For England’s opening World Cup game against Italy in Manaus next Saturday night, £91 tickets are on offer at £884 on website Ticketbis.

Elsewhere on the web, Live Football Tickets and 1st 4 Football Tickets – operated by the same company – are selling the same category tickets for £501 each. Both sites advertise a UK phone number, with one boasting that they ‘proudly accept’ Visa.

Last night Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, co-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Ticket Abuse, criticised the firm, saying: ‘Visa, as one of the main sponsors of the World Cup, should not be facilitating and profiting from the dubious sale of these tickets.

‘Are they going to refund fans who have bought tickets using their Visa card and are left disappointed when they  can’t get in the stadium? I think they should.

‘Every ticket a tout is reselling is one a genuine fan has been deprived of buying at face value. If the ticket has somebody else’s name on, they’re going to be hugely disappointed if it is checked and they’re not allowed in.

‘It’s great The Mail on Sunday is highlighting this issue.’

When a reporter posing as a prospective buyer called the 1st 4 Football Tickets sales line, a staff member said: ‘We sell them on behalf of sellers who obtain them through their ways that they get them – could be corporate sponsorship, it could be balloting systems… not quite sure. We don’t really care as long as they work.’

When asked whether it was legitimate, the employee, who claimed to be working in Madrid, said: ‘It’s not and it is. It’s not in terms of you’re not buying them through Fifa.

'If you’re calling us, chances are that you’ve already tried that route and it didn’t happen and you’re looking for tickets. So that’s what we do.’

Asked about the chances of being turned away when using a ticket with someone else’s name on, he added: ‘I highly doubt it… they’re not going to check 90,000, or whatever the capacity of the stadium is.’

Ticketnetwork, which operates out of the US, is selling the same tickets for as much as £542. Asked by an undercover reporter whether the sales broke Fifa’s rules, a staff member said: ‘To my knowledge, it does not.’

Kevin Miles, of the Football Supporters Federation, said: ‘We have dealt with hundreds of heartbroken fans who have been ripped off by their genuine attempts to buy tickets through less than genuine websites.

'They have paid good money for tickets which don’t exist or were originally stolen, then cancelled, rendering them worthless.

Fifa officials have been accused of ‘hijacking’ the £30 million Viaduto Sao Cristovao walkway linking Rio’s Maracana stadium and the nearby Quinta da Boa Vista park.

Opened last month as a vital route for residents over a busy road, the mayor’s office has said it will be used only by ‘Fifa VIPs’ during the tournament – much to the anger of locals

‘A health warning should be placed against any site offering World Cup tickets outside official channels.’

Thierry Weil, Fifa’s marketing director, said fans ‘paying a fortune’ for tickets through Viagogo ‘will be disappointed’ when their tickets are rejected at stadiums. Fifa has identified some tickets sold on the platform and invalidated them, he said.

Viagogo admitted the company openly flouts Fifa’s ticketing rules, but added: ‘We do not make World Cup tickets available to anyone in the UK or Brazil. We have tickets to every game available to people in other countries, from well below face value, to above face value for high-profile games.

‘It is legal for people to resell tickets on our marketplace in those countries, and gives people who didn’t get a ticket from Fifa a chance to go.’

Visa said: ‘The issue of ticket reselling is the responsibility of Fifa and they have an enforcement team in place to deal with these matters.

‘Cardholders who transacted with unofficial sellers and didn’t receive promised goods should contact their bank to report non-receipt of promised goods and determine next steps for remedy.’
