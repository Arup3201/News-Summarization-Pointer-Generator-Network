It was perhaps his most famous act of open rebellion – unfurling the Scottish flag above David Cameron’s head at Wimbledon as Andy Murray lifted the men’s singles trophy last year.

But the person behind the plot was actually Alex Salmond’s wife, Moira, who smuggled the enormous Saltire into the All England Club in her handbag.

It was a typical gesture from a woman who has been conspicuous in her absence over the past few weeks as her husband works the Yes campaign trail.

While Mrs Salmond refuses to engage in the public displays of devotion expected of political wives, behind the scenes her support for her husband has been unwavering.

At 77, she is 17 years his senior, and those who know the couple say he relies on her shrewdness and wise counsel.

They also credit her with having the final say on his return to the leadership of the SNP in 2004.

Intriguingly, while the couple’s views are mostly aligned, he has said: ‘She’s much more radical than I am now in all sorts of things.’

Mrs Salmond has been so successful at avoiding publicity the vast majority of Scots have no idea what she even looks like.

‘I’m no Glenys Kinnock. I married Alex, not politics,’ she said. ‘I am happy to be in the background. One politician in the family is quite enough.’

Last night, a senior politician and close friend said: ‘Moira sees herself simply as Alex’s wife, not the First Lady of Scotland. She’s very charming, very kind and has a wonderful way with everyone.’

The couple met in Edinburgh in the 1970s. She was then 24-year-old Mr Salmond’s boss in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, where he was an assistant economist.

They married within three years, in 1981.

When Mr Salmond was elected to Parliament in 1987, his wife, then 50, gave up her job and supported his career.

As the referendum approaches, she has set up camp at their official residence, Bute House, and will quietly support her husband whichever way the vote falls.
