An extra £100million will be made available for homeowners to get cheap new boilers and double glazing, the Lib Dems announced today.

The extra money will allow more families to apply for grants of  around £8,000 to improve their home’s energy efficiency.

Those who have moved home in the past year, meanwhile, are likely to get up to £500 under the ‘Green Deal Home Improvement Fund’ - although the exact details are yet to be agreed.

The big six energy firms have also been ordered to slash the time it takes for people to switch to cheaper rivals, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said today.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced an extra £100million would be made available for families to get cheaper boilers

Mr Davey, speaking to the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow today, said the moves were designed to ‘deliver cheaper greener energy’.

He also confirmed plans  for families to get £100 off their council tax bill if they make their property more energy efficient and told delegates that the Lib Dems would seek to bring in laws to ban coal being used to generate electricity from 2025 should they be in government after next year's general election.

But Mr Davey's set piece announcement was the £100million boost to the Green Deal.

He said: ‘Today I can announce an extra one hundred million pounds to help people cut their energy bills.

‘We will extend the Green Deal Home Improvement Fund that proved so popular earlier this year. New boilers. Double glazing. Better insulation. So people can permanently cut their bills.’

Replacing an inefficient boiler and insulating cavity walls costs about £4,000, with an average energy bill saving of £200 to £300 a year.

Solid wall insulation costs between £5,000 and £10,000, but can save households up to £400 a year on heating bills.

Insulating a loft and installing solar panels costs £6,000 and saves about £200 a year.

Mr Davey claimed the energy market was in a ‘real mess’ under Labour.

He said: ‘Ed Miliband, Labour’s last energy minister, left an energy market dominated by the “Big 6”, with over 99 per cent market share.

‘Miliband had refused to take on these big business interests. Miliband was happy with Labour’s Big six.

‘Well, Liberal Democrats weren’t. We could see the dangers to people’s energy bills from Labour’s weak approach to energy competition. After all, fuel poverty had rocketed under Labour.

‘So we set out to grow new competitors to Labour’s Big 6. To make it easier and quicker for people to switch their energy supplier.

‘And it’s worked. We’ve nearly trebled the number of smaller firms. Two million people have switched from Labour’s big 6.

‘And prices are now being frozen – or better, in many cases, cut. And despite that success, I want to go much further.

‘That’s why I support the first ever independent review of Britain’s energy markets – a review Ed Miliband rejected three times when he was doing my job.

‘That’s why I can announce today that I am delivering on my promise to halve switching times this year. Every major energy firm is on schedule to deliver the faster switching I have demanded.’

Mr Davey attacked the Tories for wanting to ‘frack every square mile of Britain’ – but warned activists that the ‘real enemy’ was not shale gas but coal.

He said: ‘Coal is the climate destroyer. That’s why I’m pleased to announce that if the Liberal Democrats are in government after the election, we will legislate to ban the generation of electricity from coal from 2025.

‘But renewables cannot quickly replace all of the electricity we currently get from coal without carbon, capture and storage. We will need gas, as a bridge to a zero fossil fuel future, at least for the next two or three decades. That’s reality.

‘And I’d far rather use Britain’s gas, than Putin’s gas. Or even Middle East gas.

‘Our own gas is much more secure. And, thanks to our tougher environmental regulations, and not having to ship it round the world, our own gas is better for the climate.

‘As North Sea gas production falls, we simply cannot afford to turn our back on our own, home grown gas supplies.

‘But I have had to hold back the Tories’ desire to frack every square mile of Britain. Ensuring that gas exploration is safe. Protecting our national parks, areas of outstanding beauty and world heritage sites. Stopping a Tory free-for-all on fracking.’
