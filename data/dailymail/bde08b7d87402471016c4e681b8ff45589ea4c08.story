Ambulance workers reported 20 people 
had been injured in the commotion, also attended by President Shimon

and North Africa.

body systems'.

The 1km-long procession started in the district of Geula and ended at Sanhedriya cemetery

Family members and hospital officials made several pleas for well-wishers to not crowd the area, local media reported.

President Shimon Peres visited Yosef’s bedside at 11am, cutting short a meeting with the Czech prime minister.

Peres reportedly held Yosef’s hand and said goodbye before saying a prayer outside the room.

When staff informed the supporters of his death, they wept and one woman fainted.

Arye Deri (centre), leader of the ultra-religious Shas political party, looks on near the body of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, the spiritual leader of Shas, before his funeral. 'The sun has been extinguished.

Crowds gathered in the street, outside Yosef's family home and outside his hospital ward today

Desperate to glimpse their icon, boys climbed rooftops - the closest they could get as thousands swarmed the ground below

Rabbi Ovadia Yosef has suffered a series of health complications in recent weeks. His family had to ask well-wishers not to crowd the hospital's corridors as the stood, worrying, outside his eighth-floor ward

More than half a million of his followers attended the funeral, clambering over walls and buildings to play their part in the ceremony bidding farewell to a leader many brand as irreplaceable

Forlorn: Men young and old bow their heads solemnly as the shock passing of their spiritual leader sinks in. Many of Middle Eastern and African descent were thankful he celebrated their heritage

Crowded but solemn: With the streets cluttered, the best view was from up high. Not exchanging a word, the men clutch their faces in despair

Shas leader Arye Deri - currently in 
opposition - wept uncontrollably at a press conference before collapsing
in the arms of Dr Dan Gilon, who treated the late cleric.

He sobbed: 'The sun has been extinguished.

'The whole day I waited to be able to tell you that we are taking him home healthy and well.'

Referring
to Yosef as 'our father' on Kol Barma radio, he cried: 'What will 
become of us? Who will lead us? Who will take his place?'

Mr Netanyahu described Rabbi Ovadia as 'among the greatest rabbis of our generation'.

'Rabbi Ovadia was a giant in Torah and Jewish law and a teacher for tens of thousands,' he said in a statement.

'The Jewish People have lost one of the wisest men of this generation.

'I admired his amiable personality and his direct approach.

'In my meetings with him I was always made wiser and learned something.

The forceful political figure was blasted by many for chastising gay people, women, liberals, secular Jews and Arabs. But these men mourn the loss of the man they call 'The Sun'

Worshipped: A portrait of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef hangs on a wall in a yeshiva - a traditional Jewish education institute - during his funeral

National outcry: Yosef's health has been the centre of media attention over the past several weeks

Yosef promoted engineering peace talks between Palestine and Israel. People fainted outside the hospital in Jerusalem when doctors emerged with the news of his passing

The outcry from political figures of all stances demonstrated how influential Yosef was on public life. It is the largest-scale reaction to the death of a public figure the nation has ever seen

To his supporters, Rabbi Yosef was a revered spiritual sage who empowered masses of disenfranchised Sephardic Jews but among secular Israelis, he was widely perceived as a medieval figure

The crowds stayed in the streets long into the evening as Shas leader cried: 'What will become of us?'

Hundreds of yeshiva students and other followers gathered outside Yosef’s home in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof after he died.

One of the nation's most important figures, Rabbi Ovadia's health has been at the centre of media attention over the last few weeks.

He is known for chasitising Arabs, liberals, women and gay people as well as promoting peace talks between Israel and Palestine.

He was hospitalised last month after complications following kidney treatment.

After seemingly recovering late last week, he was taken off a respirator, but took a turn for the worse on Sunday.
