British photographer Tim Plowden captures the diversity and wonder of Alaska's wilderness in his new series of photographs.

From a peaceful lone moose to a river packed with pink salmon and the austere boreal forest to unpredictable glaciers, his month-long shoot offers the full spectrum of the Alaskan outback.

Plowden, who grew up enjoying the Chiltern Hills of the south-east and volunteered as a nature reserve warden in Norfolk, travelled by boat, plane, four-wheel drive and campervan around the unforgiving 49th state of the US. 

English photographer Tim Plowden gets the attention of one of a herd of barren-ground caribou in his remarkable series of Alaska images

He scoured the remote coastline, forests, mountains and tundra to shoot - with his camera, of course - some of the region's more elusive wildlife. 

Plowden's journey, which had no set itinerary, included encounters with feasting brown bear, a curious black bear, sea otters, a moose and a herd caribou up close and personal.

While it all sounds like a fairytale for the young Englishman, and his images evoke the beauty and peace from the harsh environment, some less than tactical methods were sometimes employed, he admits.

The caribou, not too dissimilar to the secretive roe deer which Plowden spent a year of early mornings and late evenings studying and developing his photography skills on in Nofolk in 2013, with one of his images winning the British Deer Society's 50th anniversary open photographic competition.

 'I put my own knowledge and experience of photographing wild deer in England to the test in the high tundra of Alaska's interior wilderness,' Plowden said. 'Having driven a thousand miles in beautiful autumnal scenery I wanted to stop for a while and get out into the wild'.

Tim stopped with a local family and headed out into the cold with the father, who was a licensed hunter and used to tracking the caribou.

Tim comments: 'We came across a majestic bull and his harem of cows crossing one side of the mountainous valley to the next.

'As they were about to disappear over the other side of a ridge my host, who wanted me to get the shot I'd been talking about, used one of his tried and tested caribou calls: '"Hey a**hole! Stop!"

'It did the trick; the bull stopped in his tracks and stared down as my host continued shouted out sporadic expletives as I tried not to collapse with laughter and to compose both myself and get the shot'.'
