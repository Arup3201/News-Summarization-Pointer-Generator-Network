David Pedersen who murdered four people in 2011 was treated to a lavish meal in an Oregon prison after he cooperated and admitted his guilt in the last two killings

A white supremacist killer who went on a nine-day spree which left four people dead was treated to a slap-up meal as a 'thank-you' from the state attorney's office for pleading guilty in an alleged bungled case.

David 'Joey' Pedersen was arrested in 2011 following the murders of his father and stepmother, an Oregon teenager and a California man.

He pleaded guilty in 2012 in Washington state to murdering his father David 'Red' Pedersen and stepmother Leslie 'Dee Dee' Pedersen and was sentenced to life in prison.

However, he had not pleaded guilty to the carjacking murders of Reginald Clark, 53, or 19-year-old Cody Myers. 

It was reported by The Oregonian that the case had many problems, including missing evidence. 

The paper revealed on Sunday that in May, Pedersen had been allowed to enjoy a homemade feast of salmon and greens before a cheese plate and dessert during the meal with his defense team.

News of the meal caused much anger among prison employees, The Oregonian reported. 

The lavish meal appears to be part of an agreement reached with Pedersen by the prosecution. 

Days before Pedersen sat down to the feast, he pleaded guilty to the murders of Reginald Clark and Cody Myers in exchange for the meal and  shortening of the sentence of one of his friends who gave him a gun, according to The Oregonian.

The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to MailOnline today that Pedersen's meal had taken place inside the jail.

It is unclear who paid for Pedersen's meal as his defense attorneys brought the food in with them during their scheduled client meeting. 

A public spokesman told MailOnline today: 'It [the food] was examined for safety and security reasons prior to entering. 

'It did not break a jail rule as the items were authorized to be brought in with the defense attorney and investigators for the meeting.'

He said that individual requests are considered on a case by case basis and it is not a common for a prisoner to be allowed an a la carte meal. 

The spokesman was unclear if such a meal had been allowed before at the jail. 

 Pedersen was sentenced to life in prison today for the murders of Mr Clark, 53, and 19-year-old college student Mr Myers.

The killer told those in the Portland federal courtroom that Monday's sentencing was 'rather anti-climactic,' because he had already been sentenced to life in prison in Washington state for the deaths of his father and stepmother.

Pedersen made a lengthy statement to the court in which he blasted police, prosecutors and American foreign policy. 

He had already been sentenced to life in prison for killing his father and stepmother. His sister, Holly Perez, shouted at him to 'shut up'.

MailOnline was awaiting for a response from the U.S. Attorney's office in Oregon.

However Pedersen's defense attorney Richard Wolf told The Oregonian: 'How badly did the U.S. Attorney's Office have to screw up the case to the point they allowed us to have a meal with our client?'

Defense attorney Mr Wolf told The Oregonian that Pedersen had read about one of his previous clients, killer Tremayne Durham, who received a meal of fried chicken, pizza and ice-cream in exchange for a guilty plea in 2008.

In April, allegations about the mishandling of the murder case came to light in court during arguments between the defense and prosecution. There were claims that crime scene evidence had disappeared and Pedersen's rights as a prisoner had been violated. 

Pedersen shot his father in the back of the head while the elder man was driving on September 26, 2011. 

Red Pedersen moved and moaned for at least 30 minutes before dying, prosecutors said. 

Joey Pedersen believed that his father deserved to die because he had allegedy molested one of his daughters, rendering him a degenerate unworthy of the white race in his son's eyes, according to court documents.  

Pedersen is the founder of a white supremacist prison gang, and told girlfriend Holly Grigsby about his desire to start a revolution with a killing rampage targeting Jewish leaders.

Pedersen, along with his sympathizer Grigsby, 27, then returned to the family home.

Dee Dee Pedersen was bound with duct tape, slashed in the neck with a pair of dull knives and left to bleed to death.

'Animals are treated more humanely going to slaughter than your victims were,' said Holly Perez, the daughter of Red Pedersen and sister of the murderer at the time of his 2012 sentencing. 

The couple then drove Red Pedersen's vehicle south into Oregon, where they shot and killed 19-year-old Oregon college student Mr Myers and stole his car, authorities said. 

They shot Mr Myers, who was Christian, because his name sounded Jewish, according to court documents.

Grigsby would later tell police they did not want any witnesses, and they regarded Mr Myers as a 'casualty of war'.

Pedersen and Grigsby then headed to northern California, where Mr Clark, a 53-year-old black man, was shot dead after he offered them a ride.

The persecutors wrote in court documents, cited by The Oregonian, that the pair viewed Clark not only as a potential witness who had to be neutralized, but also as a 'Negro degenerate'.

Grigsby and Pedersen were arrested October 5, 2011, outside Yuba City, California, when a police officer spotted them in Myers' car. 

Grigsby told officers they were on their way to Sacramento to 'kill more Jews,' court documents said.
