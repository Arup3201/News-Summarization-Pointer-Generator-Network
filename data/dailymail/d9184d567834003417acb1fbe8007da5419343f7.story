In court: Terry Potter had taken 20 diazepam tablets and was 'extremely high' when he got behind the wheel of the single-decker bus

A drugged-up bus depot worker got behind the wheel of one of the buses and went on a two-hour joyride, a court heard.

Terry Potter had taken 20 diazepam tablets and was 'extremely high' when he got behind the wheel of the single-decker Arriva bus and started driving around Bolton.

He was even caught on CCTV getting out of the driver’s seat to adjust the mirror at the nearside of the bus - while it was still moving.

Potter, of Halliwell,
Bolton, pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving 
and driving with no insurance yesterday.

Chairman of the bench at Bolton 
magistrates’ court, Sandra Whittle, said: 'The facts of the case bring a
whole new meaning to taking the bus home.'

The 28-year-old, who appeared in court wearing a t-shirt with the words 'I was amazing last night', was only caught when he was spotted by a former colleague at the Arriva depot in Bolton.

Arriva employee Simon Schofield raised 
the alarm when he saw the bus being driven along Green Lane and followed
it as he was returning to the depot.

Potter realised he was being followed, stopped the bus and ran away down a narrow path.

No damage was caused to the bus during the two-hour long joy-ride.

Potter hung his head and did not watch the footage of his driving while it was played to the court.

Claire Ludlam, prosecuting, said Potter had taken 20 diazepam tablets and was 'extremely high' and had no recollection of taking the bus at 8pm on April 12.

Potter, who is unemployed, had worked previously at Arriva for six months where he was responsible for checking the buses were insured and kept in a good condition.

To steal the bus he pressed a sequence of buttons to start the engine, which he learned during his employment at Arriva.

The court heard Potter was driving at a 'normal speed'.

James Towey, defending, said: 'It was a meaningless offence. There was no rhyme or reason behind it.'

Bailed: Terry Potter got behind the wheel of a single-decker Arriva bus (similar to this one) parked at the Bolton bus depot (pictured) and went on a two hour joyride but was only caught when he was spotted by a colleague

Potter, who has previous unrelated convictions, was not charged with driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs because he was arrested several days after the incident.

Colleagues identified Potter to police.

Mrs Whittle said: 'It was absolutely appalling that you took a public service vehicle on open roads in the evening. It was evident from CCTV how much light you had. It was just awful.'

The case was adjourned for probation reports to be drafted as magistrates could not rule out a custodial sentence.

Potter was granted bail until he is sentenced on Friday but was disqualified from driving but a term of disqualification has not yet been set.
