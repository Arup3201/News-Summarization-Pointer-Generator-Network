When Ava Galley, now four, from Cheshire, was born, her mother Nichola, 35, just had enough time to glimpse a pair of eyes and a tiny nose before her new daughter was whisked away by nurses.

By the time she next saw her daughter, she was in the midst of a tangle of wires as doctors frantically tried to work out what was wrong with the tiny baby and find a solution for her continual vomiting.

But more than four years on, Nichola and the doctors are no wiser and while they have managed to fix Ava's heart problems, precisely what sort of genetic disorder she suffers from remains unknown.

Rare: Nichola with her little daughter Ava who has a genetic disorder so rare, it doesn't even have a name

Enjoying life: Despite her condition, Ava has learned to walk with the aid of a walking frame

'It was like a punch in the stomach 
because we'd been given the all-clear from the amnio test,' says Nichola of the moment she discovered that her tiny baby wasn't the healthy daughter she had hoped for.

'The pregnancy
had been tortuous but we just thought she was going to be a very
 small baby. We were in the recovery room and laughing and joking when the doctor came in.

'The
 way the news was delivered to us… he walked into the room 
with a nurse and delivered it so abruptly - even the nurse was shocked.'

Convinced Ava wouldn't survive, doctors tried to prepare a devastated Nichola and her husband Paul for the worst but, much to the surprise of medics, the little girl clung on.

Initially, the biggest challenge was working out how to feed her: with Ava unable to suck and prone to vomiting whenever she was given milk.

'She was poorly
 and it turned out that every time they fed her, they were drowning her 
because the milk was going straight to the chest, straight to the lungs,' remembers Nichola.

'It was a good four months before we got her home and she has spent pretty much the first three years of her 
life were in hospital. This summer is the first that she hasn’t been in 
and out all the time.'

Despite her improving condition, Ava who suffers from microcephaly [an unusually small skull] in addition to the genetic disorder, is still unable to walk unaided, talk or feed herself.

She also continues to vomit uncontrollably, which means she regularly suffers from chest infections and needs a special bed, a feeding pump and round-the-clock care from her mother who has been forced to give up a promising career to care for her.

'She still vomits and I never know quite 
how much food to give her or whether her body is going to tolerate that 
feed,' explains Nichola.

Family: Ava with her big brother James, seven, who has also learned to live with his sister's genetic disorder

Tough: Ava requires round-the-clock care which means Nichola has been unable to return to work

Limited: Because Ava's condition is so rare, no one knows how long she will live - doctors estimated five

'It's easier now we've got the feeding pump but before, with 
gravity feeding, I would be there for an hour and I couldn’t leave her, 
not to go to the toilet, to answer the door or for anything.

'Then, you’d
 have to do it all over again. I was trapped. I was a proper prisoner in
 my own home. Now with the pump, I programme it to put the food in over 
an hour, although we still have to have vomit jugs around 
the house.'

Ava's condition has also had a huge impact on her older brother James, seven, who, says Nichola, has had to see things that a child should never have to.

More difficult to deal with is the lack of facts. Not only do Nichola and husband Paul have no idea what exactly is wrong with their daughter, they have no idea of what the future for Ava will look like.

Although doctors originally put her life expectancy at between three and five years, Nichola hopes that Ava will live longer.

'The prognosis has always been "we don't 
know",' she says, sadly. 'Ava has microcephaly and that combined with 
her chest infections has cut her life down a lot.

'She’s having fewer and 
fewer chest infections which is good but if her skull stops growing, 
then that's where we know that we won't have much time left with her. 
We're just ticking along at the minute.'

Not that she has any regrets about learning to love her daughter which she admits, in a bid to protect herself, she tried hard not to do at first.

'I did try 
not to fall in love with her [at first] because I thought we were going to lose 
her,' she confesses.

'I never thought we'd bring her home. It did take me a long time to 
let myself go and fall head over heels with her. I was trying to prepare
 myself to let her go, sort of protecting myself.'

Difficult though Ava's first four years have been, Nichola bubbles over with love for her daughter but says that she would have liked more help.

'No, I don't think we've had enough help,' she says. 'I 
want to return to work. I had to give up a career. I spent four years in higher education
 and I'm in debt with my student loan because I can’t pay it off.

Grateful: Although no one knows how long Ava has, Nichola says she is grateful to have been able to know her

'Instead, I work 24-hours a day caring for Ava. There is no rest from 
that. I get eight hours a week support but finding respite care at the 
right time such as on the school run is hard because they have families 
of their own.

'It can be a nightmare on the school run if Ava's being 
sick and I have to get to school to pick up James... Those are the times
 when I would like some help.'

She also says she has been less than impressed with the local council who, after refusing to pay for a specialist bed, offered to pay for a crash mat to place beside a regular one instead.

'She's on a feeding pump which is a long tangled wire,' explains Nichola. 'She’d fall out, trip over the wire, get tangled up or 
bump into the wardrobe which could then fall down on her.

'In the end, the New Life charity 
provided the bed that she's got. We are so very grateful to them for doing that.

'But you
 feel like you're constantly begging for help and it's demoralising. I 
don't want to be in this situation and begging for help. I’m just trying
 to join in with life - everything is a bit hard to be honest.'

Despite the challenges and uncertainty of life with Ava, Nichola is doing her best to be as positive as she can.

'You don't know how long
 you've got with anybody do you?' she says.  It's hard knowing that Paul won't be 
walking her down the aisle, that we’ll never go and get our hair done 
together or talk about boyfriends - that hurts.

'But I'm 
grateful that I've had the opportunity to get to know her.'
