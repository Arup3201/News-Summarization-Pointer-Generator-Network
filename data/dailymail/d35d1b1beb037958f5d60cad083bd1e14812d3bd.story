Emma Thompson, pictured with Greg Wise, her husband of ten years, said monogamy is an 'odd state'

She has been happily married for ten years.

But Emma Thompson says she thinks monogamy is an ‘odd state’ and that the ‘disbelief and horror’ of infidelity is unrealistic.

The actress, 54, who starred in Love Actually, playing a lovelorn wife mistreated by her cheating husband, made her surprisingly frank comments during a web chat on Wednesday night.

Miss Thompson, who is mother to daughter Gaia, 13, and adopted son Tindyebwa Agaba, 26, also revealed she worries about the lack of decent role models for young girls, the lack of acting roles for women and confessed she is always on a diet – even though she believes they are the ‘spawn of Satan’.

She said: ‘I do think that monogamy is an odd state, and actually I think it’s an odd state for women.

‘I think that we’re locked into certain ideas and certain romantic ideals that have shaped our thinking about relationships for some time. 

'And I do sometimes wonder about whether there are alternatives, and about whether our fury and rage and disbelief and horror about infidelity is quite realistic.

‘All the fairy stories end when people 
get married and go off into the sunset, there are very few stories that 
deal with the nuts and bolts and actualities of serious relationships.

‘I
think that relationships are very hard work, that we can take our eyes 
off the ball very easily, I think that children can be a huge strain on 
relationships – it depends on what kind of relationship you have.’

Miss Thompson married actor Greg Wise, 47, in 2003.

The Oscar-winning actress met Wise in 1995 on the set of the film Sense and Sensibility in which they co-starred.

Miss Thompson’s marriage to actor Kenneth Branagh was falling apart and she has previously described how Wise ‘saved’ her.

Thompson played a lovelorn wife married to a cheating husband (played by Alan Rickman). The actress said she wonders whether the 'disbelief and horror about infidelity is quite realistic'

However the Nanny McPhee star said she doubts whether the ‘happy-ever-after ideal’ exists.

She said: ‘All I’m suggesting is that there are other models and I’m also suggesting that we’d been a little bit caught by the happy-ever-after ideal.

‘All the fairy stories end when people get married and go off into the sunset – there are very few  stories that deal with the nuts and bolts and actualities of serious relationships.’

Miss Thompson also confessed to being on ‘endless diets’, but  recommended that others don’t follow her lead.

‘Don’t ever go on a diet,’ she said. ‘Just don’t. Walk away. From the diet. Ignore the books. Ignore the magazines. Make the diet the D word. Diets are the spawn of Satan.’

She added: ‘Young girls have no role models these days, its sad. There is too much attention paid to being empty in popular media.

'There aren’t many roles for any women, old or young. There’s a bald patch between 40 and 55 because you’re not the romantic lead anymore or the mother (although that’s all you’re offered).’

Miss Thompson made her comments on a live web chat on the parenting forum Mum’s Net, to celebrate the release of her second children’s book entitled Christmas Tales of Peter Rabbit.

It follows The Further Tales of Peter Rabbit, which was published in honour of the 110th anniversary of Beatrix Potter’s original series about the mischievous bunny.

And Miss Thompson, who won an screenwriting Oscar for her adaptation of Jane Austin’s Sense and Sensibility, said she regrets not reading more to her daughter.

‘Read to [your children]’ she advised a forum member. ‘Read things that you like. Don’t worry about them reading for a bit, children don’t have to start reading until quite late on I think.

‘I think it’s nice to be read to and I wish I had insisted on reading to my daughter for longer before she thrusted me to the side. I think it’s so valuable to take something that you love and read it.’
