Dressed in white and staring at the camera, the mugshots of bank-robbing stripper Lee Grace Dougherty and her two brothers were released today as the trio were put behind bars on a $1.25 million bond.

This morning a Pueblo County judge set bond for the infamous Dougherty siblings and rejected objections from their lawyer about photos of his clients being taken at the jail.

According to an arrest affidavit, Dougherty told police 'I deserved to get shot', after she was wounded and captured at the end of a high speed chase.

Appearing by video link, the trio face charges of attempted first-degree murder of a police officer and are expected to be charged with first-degree assault on a peace officer with a firearm after they led the FBI on a nationwide manhunt.

The suspects were finally captured in a high-speed police chase and shoot-out on a Colorado highway yesterday morning.

Bank-robbing stripper Lee Grace 
Dougherty was shot in the leg during the dramatic final shoot-out while 
her two brothers Dylan and Ryan were injured in the 20-mile, 100mph 
crash.

The injured trio were then taken to Spanish Peak's Medical Center to be treated before being transferred in the hospital outfits to prison.

During the earlier chase, Lee-Grace, 29, got out of the gang's high-powered Subaru Impreza and 
started shooting at police with a handgun. Officers returned fire, hitting her in the 
leg.

Her brothers Ryan, 21, and Dylan, 26, fled in a different directions and were 
arrested a short time later. One brother was apprehended with the help 
of construction workers who tackled and subdued him.

All three were arrested after the 
pursuit and gunfight south of the town of Pueblo.

Police
recovered two AK-47 assault rifles and a MAC-11 pistol at the crash 
site. At least one of the AK-47s were used in the rolling gun battle 
with police.

Pasco
County Sheriff Chris Nocco said about the gang's capture: 'I'm proud to say we won. We continuously said that if these 
three fugitives wanted a battle with law enforcement, we would win that 
battle. And that's what happened today.'

Kevin Widner, who was one of the police officers at the scene, today said: 'At first it was like, "Wow, you know, they're shooting at me." And then it turned to I just want to catch them before they hurt anybody.'

Three highway workers reportedly helped track and capture that sibling. Dave Dallaguardia told ABC's Good Morning America that he followed Ryan Dougherty in his truck even after the fugitive had motioned at him as if he had a gun.

Mr Dallaguardia said he had no idea he was chasing one of the Dougherty siblings and his wife later scolded him for pursuing him. He said he and his co-workers came from small, blue-collar towns.

'If you need to lend a hand, you lend a hand and help people out,' he said.

The Florida mother of the siblings said she is devastated after the week-long manhunt and arrest of her children.

Barbara Bell of East Palatka, Florida, said:'Thank God they're not tried 
by the media.

'They're tried in a court of law and their 
story will come out at that time.'

She added: 'I'm devastated and I'm 
trying to be strong for other family members. Throughout all of this, I 
think everybody just wanted it to 
stop. And now it's over.'

The trio had been on the run, hunted by police and the FBI, after storming a Valdosta, Georgia, bank on 
August 2 with guns blazing, shooting up the ceiling before making off 
with an unknown amount of cash.

Earlier that day, the siblings eluded a Florida police officer in a high-speed chase that 
ended when they shot out one of the officer's tires.

The Doughertys were spotted in Colorado on Tuesday as they shopped at an outdoors store near Colorado Springs.

The sighting led authorities to 
believe the bank-robbing stripper and her brothers may be looking for a 
campground or rural area to hide out.

Park
rangers were put on alert after three people matching their 
descriptions bought camping items at an outdoors shop near Interstate 
25.

Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said that the thrill-seeking siblings had a massive cache
of high-powered weapons - and they were not afraid to use them.

Neither one of the Doughertys were strangers to trouble with the law.

Lee-Grace,
29, who worked as an exotic dancer at Florida strip club Cheaters 
before the crime spree began, is wanted for a probation violation.

She was charged earlier this year for a hit-and-run crash and battery.

Dylan, 26, had previously been charged with marijuana possession.

Ryan, 21, a registered sex offender, 
had been fitted with an ankle monitoring bracelet, which was cut off and
found near the scene of the car chase.

He was convicted of sending 
sexually explicit messages to an 11-year-old-girl.

Records show he had registered as a sex offender on Monday.

His mother said that he was 
'unbearably discouraged by the terms of his probation' and said he 
feared the conviction would prohibit him from seeing his newborn son.

Beneath a Florida home the trio shared 
earlier this year, investigators found an bunker that neighbours say may
have been a den of illegal activity.

The
underground structure is made up of two 40-foot cargo containers buried
next to each other, with a man-made hallway leading to them.The structure was outfitted with both electricity and running water.

Pictures of them were splashed 
on billboards throughout the Southeast.
