An Oxford University student who claims she was raped by another undergrad after playing a drinking game, says she was 'ignored' and pressured into dropping the charges.

Writing under an assumed name, the student known as 'Maria Marcello' says she was raped in  her second year after passing out in her own bed due to the effects of alcohol.

She claims that the man bragged about it at dinner the next day, but police pressured her into dropping the charges and advised her to drink less in the future.

The student also slammed Judge Mary Jane Mowat's controversial comments which suggested  the rape conviction rate would not improve until women stopped drinking so heavily.

Ms Marcello said: 'Judge Mowat's recent comments about rape convictions are outrageous, but to me they are also personal.

'I was raped while passed out in my bed. Yes, my unconsciousness was due to alcohol.

'Poker rapidly descended into a drinking game and I, being a fatal combination of bad at poker and intolerant of alcohol, passed out. I have since learnt that I was put to bed, but I don't remember anything. Then a guy I didn't know had sex with me in my sleep.

'I have one very clear memory which still haunts me two years later.

Marcello slammed Judge Mary Jane Mowat's suggestion that the rape conviction rate would not improve 'until women stop getting so drunk'

'I remember waking up during the night and seeing him on top of me, my trousers around my ankles and my shirt still on. I pulled away and heard him mutter 'Oh no, it fell out' to himself, at which point I blacked out again. I assume he continued to rape me.'

She says that when she plucked up the courage to go to the police station, a receptionist insisted that she gave the details of the rape in front of everyone in the waiting room.

Two officers then came to her house, where she was questioned further.

She said: 'One described rape as 'just something that happens', especially at university. The only advice I received was to drink less in future.'

Ms Marcello then claims she was forcefully questioned by a woman who concluded that because she was drunk she would not be able to prove anything in court.

'The woman insisted on me deciding whether or not to press charges immediately,' she said.

'Still shaken and vulnerable, I was in no position to make such a decision on the spot, and frankly her description of the court process scared me. It was little wonder, then, that I dropped it.

'I was not allowed to leave the kitchen until I had made my decision. She didn't fail to emphasise how traumatic I would find the process or her certainty my case would not stand up in court: I would be unable to prove I was unconscious at the time or that I didn't drunkenly consent.'

The female officer allegedly said that there was not enough evidence, even though photos and videos had been taken of her by  friends which showed her unconscious on the floor and bed.

Ms Marcello said: 'Had the police cared enough they could have acquired DNA, but the woman told them to return the clothes, bedsheets and used condoms I had given them. 

'These all provided incontrovertible evidence that the guy had sex with me. In fact, given his bragging at dinner the following day, this was never really in question. 'I lost the poker,' he said, 'but I did pretty well if you know what I mean. Just typing that today sickens me.' 

The Sexual Offences Act 1956 lists 'evidence that by reason of drink, the complainant was unaware of what was occurring and/or incapable of giving valid consent' as a means by which to establish rape.

A spokeswoman from Thames Valley Police said: 'If a person if unhappy with the service they have received then we would invite them to make an official complaint to our quality of service department. All the details are on the website.' 

Ms Marcello says that she was largely 'ignored' by the welfare officers at her college at Oxford University

The student says that when she spoke to the welfare staff at her Oxford college she was largely ignored and her alleged attacker received a minor reprimand and no further repercussions.

She said: 'My Oxford college, when I spoke to its professional welfare staff, largely ignored me. 

'Despite several friends explaining on multiple occasions that his mere presence unnerved me, he seemed to devote his life to making me feel uncomfortable. On nights I was working behind the college bar, he would carefully place himself between me and the exit, sitting there all night.

'One time when I left a party as soon as he came in he followed me all the way out of college. I ran, and made it halfway back to my house before stopping. Whether his behaviour was intentional is irrelevant: I spent as little time in college as I could, rarely attending events there.

'I have contacted the welfare officers about this, but they have largely ignored me except to say that if he’s around I should just leave. I have a year left at Oxford, as does he. I still don’t understand why I should be the one leaving.'

A spokesman for Oxford University said: 'Sexual harassment and violence of any kind is unacceptable at Oxford. When such incidents do occur, our culture is one of strong support for victims, including guidance and advice on making complaints.' 

Judge Mowat's comments sparked outrage after suggesting that women should not get drunk in order to protect themselves from being raped.

The Oxford-educated judge said: 'It is an inevitable fact of it being one person's word against another and the burden of proof being that you have to be sure before you convict.

'I will also say, and I will be pilloried for saying so, but the rape conviction statistics will not improve until women stop getting so drunk.'

In response to this Ms Marcello said: 'Mowat is right in that rape conviction statistics are lower than they should be. However, the criminal justice system is to blame, not drunk women.'

In Oxford, only 24 per cent of rape trials result in conviction, according to the latest figures.

The president of the Oxford Union, Ben Sullivan, 21, was cleared of rape allegations in June this year and has called for the right of anonymity for those accused of similar claims.

He was on bail for six weeks after being arrested over claims he raped one fellow student and attacked another.
