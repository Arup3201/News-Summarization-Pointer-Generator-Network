Three men have been charged with murdering a bright teenager just days before he was due to receive his GCSE results.

Ali Akbar Choudhury, Muhammod Malik and Mashudur Rahman are accused of killing 16-year-old Ajmol Alom, in east London, on August 12.

They are also charged with the attempted murder of another 16-year-old, Ajmol's friend, on the same night.

Choudhury, 20, and Rahman, 22, will appear at Thames Magistrates Court later today.

Ajmol Alom, who was murdered in an apparently unprovoked attack, achieved eight grade As and three grade Bs in his GCSEs

Malik, 21, will appear at the Old Bailey on Friday. A fourth man, 19-year-old Aminur Nazir Khan, had already been charged by police over the attack and will appear before a court at a future date.

Ajmol, described as a star pupil with 'a very bright future' ahead of him, was stabbed after he and his friends were confronted by a gang in Spey Street, Poplar, at 9.50pm on August 12.

Ajmol was badly wounded, while a friend of the same age was also stabbed. Both were taken to an east London hospital, where the keen boxer died.

It was confirmed last month that Ajmol, who was described by his headteacher at Langdon Park School in Poplar as 'one of our brightest pupils', achieved top grades in his GCSEs.

The teenager achieved eight grade As in subjects including maths, science, English literature, geography, religious studies and citizenship; and three B grades in English language, humanities and physical education.

Ajmol was described as 'one of our brightest prospects' by his headmaster at Langdon Park School in Poplar

Shortly after his death his headteacher at Langdon Park School in Poplar revealed he had been considering a career in medicine.

Speaking after the teenager's GCSE results were revealed, headteacher
Chris Dunne said: 'One of the careers he was considering was in 
medicine, and these results would have made that a very real possibility
in terms of university entrance.

'All
the many journalists who interviewed me after the horrifying event of 
his murder wanted to know how "good" he was as a student.

'I
was able to say without hesitation that he was very able, looking 
forward to GCSE results at a very high level and very capable of going 
on to achieve the kind of grades which would have secured him a place at
any one of our best universities.'

He
said that he had interviewed Ajmol for a place in the school’s new 
sixth form a few weeks ago, and that he would remember most 'how 
hardworking he was as a student, and how very decent he was as a 
person'.

Ajmol's headteacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in Northern Ireland

Mr Dunne went 
on: 'Some youngsters as able as Ajmol don’t ever realise their full 
potential because they aren’t prepared to do what’s necessary to ensure 
success. Some are remembered for the way they show off their cleverness 
at the expense of other, less able students. Ajmol’s approach was the 
opposite.

'He would always have been the last 
person to boast of his ability. He regularly attended the extra classes 
and revision sessions run by his teachers, even when he probably didn’t 
need their help any longer. His friends could rely on him for help if 
they needed it, not for arrogance or scorn.'

The teacher said his last memory of the keen boxer was when he volunteered to be part of a peace project in Northern Ireland.

Mr
Dunne went on: 'We are constantly bombarded with negative stories about
young people, about their poor attitudes and anti-social behaviour. 
Working in schools and youth clubs for the past 40 years I have learned 
the opposite, that the vast majority of young people are in fact very 
decent, and undoubtedly go on to be equally decent adults.

'Our school, our community, our country 
has just lost one of its brightest prospects and we are all rightly 
shocked and depressed by it. The best comfort we can take from it is 
that, for however a short a time, those of us that knew Ajmol knew a 
very splendid young man and a fine citizen.'
