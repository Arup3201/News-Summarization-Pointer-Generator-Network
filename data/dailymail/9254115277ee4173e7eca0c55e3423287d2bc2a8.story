These moving new pictures show the desperate plight of India's most  vulnerable young children, left to fend for themselves on the streets of the New Delhi.

January was a bitterly cold month, with children withstanding the coldest day in the capital for 44 years.

In New Delhi there are 100,000 homeless children and 33 per cent of them are only six to ten-years-old, according to UNICEF.

Rather than looking after them, heavy-handed police officials treat them like any other petty criminals.

One homeless project manager even says that they are often beaten for being on the street.

Among the children struggling to keep going is Sanjay Kumar, 13, who sells car phone chargers at a busy traffic junction.

He came from Bihar, one of India's most impoverished states, and now survives by earning up to 300 rupees (Â£3.50) on a 'good day'.

Sanjay explained: 'I ran away from my home six years ago because my father used to beat me up.'

'One day I ended up on a train and when I woke up I was here. Sometimes I want to go back but I don't know how.'

Helped by the
computer industry, India's economy has grown to the tenth largest
in the world, according to the Centre for 
Economics and Business Research (CEBR).

CEBR
also estimates India will overtake the UK in 2017 to become the largest
Commonwealth economy - and yet there are hundreds of thousands of 
children living in abject poverty.

This winter has been particularly 
tough for the estimated 150,000 homeless people of New Delhi.

Since December 1 one hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, alone received 26 unclaimed bodies.

Delhi Police officials said they found several poor people frozen to death during the cold spell in January.

While
all street children are vulnerable, young girls are at most risk of 
exploitation, according to Chetna, a non-governmental organisation 
supporting homeless families.

Chetna
project manager Rila Singh said: 'Poverty remains the root cause. Many 
parents force their children to work.'

'Police officials often beat up these 
children for sleeping on the streets which makes them more susceptible 
to criminal elements and ends up isolating them even more.'

The hit film Slumdog Millionaire by British director Danny Boyle highlighted many of these issues and brought them to a global audience.

The story follows a poor teenager from the slums of Mumbai who gets on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and progresses to the 20-million-rupee question.

In real life, of course, these children do not get the same happy ending.
