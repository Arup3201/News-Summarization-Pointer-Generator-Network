Guilty: Michael Saunders, 48, was handed a 12-year prison sentence for brutally stabbing his partner in front of their four-year-old girl

A four-year-old girl was the key witness in a trial that saw her father jailed for an 'atrocious' knife attack on her mother.

Michael Saunders, 48, from Swindon, Wiltshire, was handed a 12-year prison sentence at Bristol Crown Court after pleading guilty to attempted murder.

Saunders attacked his partner, slashing her across the face in front of their four-year-old daughter, while their two-year-old was asleep in his cot.

The woman, who has not been named, suffered a number of knife wounds to her face and arms and was rushed to hospital after the girl pleaded with her father to call an ambulance.

The four-year-old was able to give a clear account to the police, telling them: 'Daddy had the knife. It was a big knife. He tipped the knife upside down and went like this (demonstrating a downward stabbing motion).

'Mummy got hit on the head.'

The girl told police that she saw her mother bleeding heavily and added: 'Daddy told mummy to die and he told the police that mummy had a knife but she didn't. That was a lie.'

The Crown Prosecution Service said the attack was a 'tragic' case of domestic violence.

The couple had been living together on and off for approximately six years after they met on a night out in Nottingham, the court heard.

Last year they moved their family to Swindon and while Saunders continued working in Nottingham, their relationship started to fall apart and he became abusive.

Rachael Marshall, senior Crown Prosecutor for Wessex, said: 'This is a tragic case of extreme domestic violence where the controlling and aggressive behaviour of the defendant led him to stab his partner in front of their daughter who was four-years-old at the time, while their two-year-old boy was sleeping in his cot.

'From the moment they moved to the Swindon area, their relationship deteriorated.

'On Friday 16 December 2011 the victim decided to go on a night out with her brother, leaving the children with Saunders.

'Not long after she returned home and went to bed, Saunders confronted her. He knew that she wanted to leave him and could not bear it.

'She went to the bathroom where he followed her with a large kitchen knife and launched a violent attack.

'The couple's child was woken up by the noise from the fight and witnessed the atrocious scene. No child should ever witness such a distressing scene. It was the child that urged Saunders to call for an ambulance.'

Ms Marshall said the girl's evidence along with other available evidence made a strong case against Saunders, of Freshbrook, Swindon, and it was clear that he did not act in self-defence.

'Thanks to his guilty plea, the victim and her daughter will not have to re-live their ordeal,' she added.

'We hope now that they will be able to move on with their lives. Our thoughts are with them at this moment.'
