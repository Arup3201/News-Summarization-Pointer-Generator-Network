The thought of his unborn child inspired Olympic champion Greg Rutherford to win Commonwealth gold in the long jump on Wednesday night.

The 27-year-old and his girlfriend Susie are expecting their first baby in the autumn and Rutherford said thinking about his 'family-to-be' had pushed him to jump 8.20metres and win the Commonwealth title.

He said: 'Absolutely. I'm always trying to do these things for my family and make them proud and do well for them and for my family-to-be.

This one's for you, son (or daughter): Rutherford hits the sand knowing he had hit a huge score on his jump

'It's obviously going to be lovely when the baby's old enough and a grown adult to see nice performances from me. I can always say: "I was thinking of you before I did it."

'It gives me another focus. It's something I'm already using in training and on the runway, before I even jump, and it helps me.'

Rutherford only allowed himself to celebrate by eating 'a scone with lots of cream on it' on Wednesday night as he is determined to win a second gold this summer at the European Championships next month.

On to the next one: Rutherford celebrates with his gold and he now wants to add another later this summer

The Olympic champion leads the world rankings after setting a new British record of 8.51m in April, but will face significantly tougher opposition in Zurich than he did in Glasgow, with the likes of Germany's Christian Reif, Salim Sdiri of France and Greece's Louis Tsatoumas all currently in the top 10 globally.

Rutherford said: 'I see the Commonwealths as the most important major of the year but also the idea of doing the double at the Europeans has been something I’ve been thinking a lot about.

'It was a matter of doing what I needed to do in Glasgow in order to try to win it and fortunately I pulled that off.

'I could have pushed myself further but, as much as I wanted to win, I didn't want to get hurt. I thought I would conserve a little energy, get ready for Zurich and see if I can pull off this double.'
