The 61-year-old tweeted directly to Koppenhaver issuing an ultimatum to the fugitive that he had 24 hours before he personally would begin his search to track him down.

'.@WarMachine170 better 2Give All You Excuses To The Judge ..you got 24 hrs to turn your self in or I am Coming After YOU.!#CMTDogAndBeth,' was Chapman's first message.

He later tweeted: '#CMTDogAndBeth War Machine YOU HAVE 6 HOURS LEFT !!SEE YOU SOON !!' as the countdown got closer before he finished with '#CMTDogAndBeth @WarMachine170 Time is up ! BEWARE OF THE DOG...' as the 24 hours elapsed.

Mack was allegedly beaten at the hands of her ex-boyfriend at their Las Vegas home.

She is in hospital and Koppenhaver, known in the ring as War Machine, is wanted by police.

Porn star Christy Mack released these horrific images of her injuries from the hospital, claiming they were sustained when she was assaulted by former boyfriend and MMA fighter Jon Koppenhaver

Mack said that not only did Koppenhaver beat her, but that he also attacked her with a knife stabbing her repeatedly before the blade broke off

'About 2 a.m. Friday morning, Jon
 Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he 
broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego,' Mack wrote on Twitter. 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed
 in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend;
 once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention 
to me.

'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me 
out and beat my face. I  have
 no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries 
that resulted from my beating. My injuries include 18 broken bones 
around my eyes, my nose is broken in 2 places, I am missing teeth and 
several more are broken.'

Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side.

'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote. 'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife. 

Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife

Mack said that Koppenhaver had long been abusive in their relationship but that this beating had made her fear for her life

'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts. He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.'

Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife.

'I ran out my back door, shutting it 
behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the 
fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house.
 Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the 
neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought 
to the hospital and treated for my injuries.'

Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she tolerated beatings and infidelity in the past.

'After many months of fear and pressure to keep this man happy, although I fear for my life, I feel that I can no longer put myself in this situation,' she wrote.

She added that there was a $10,000 reward for his capture.

Police have yet to identify the third party who was in Mack's home and assaulted. confirming only that both Mack and the third party sustained 'severe but non-life-threatening injures.'

Koppenhaver has not come forward but he has tweeted about the incident.

'@ChristyMack I love you and hope you're okay. I came him (sic) early to surprise you and help you set up for your convention. I can't believe what I found and can't believe what happened.

'I'm so heart broken...in all ways. I will always love you.'

TMZ reports that Mack is 'in very bad shape' after the attack and can barely speak from her injuries.

A representative for the porn actress told TMZ that Mack's friends and relatives are offering a $5,000 reward to anyone who can provide clues as to Koppenhaver's whereabouts.

Koppenhaver has also taken to Twitter about the incident, writing that he wanted to surprise Mack with an engagement ring but couldn't 'believe what I found.'

'I'm not a bad guy, I went to surprise my gf, help her set up her show 
and to give her an engagement ring and ended up fighting for my life,' 
he added.

Then: "The cops will never give me fair play, never believe 
me. Still deciding what to do but at the end of the day it's all just 
heart breaking."

'I only wish that man hadn't been there and that Christy & I would 
be happily engaged.I don't know y I'm so cursed.One day truth will come out.'

Later, she tweeted that she had endured 'several slapping, choking unconscious, smothering, kicking and throwings' at his hands.
