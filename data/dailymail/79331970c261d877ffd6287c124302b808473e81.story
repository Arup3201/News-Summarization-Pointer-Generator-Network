Watchdogs have launched an inquiry into the rip-off cost of watching live Premier League football on television, which can be more than £600 a year.

The move could cut monthly subscriptions and lead to a dramatic increase in the number of games that are shown live on TV.

However, this would involve reducing the number of matches that kick-off at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon in order to fit the live games into the TV schedules.

Any shake-up would mean that more games are played on Friday and Monday evenings, while there would be staggered kick-off times during Saturday and Sunday.

The TV regulator Ofcom is to consult with fans, including the Football Supporters’ Federation, to see what they would think about sacrificing 3pm kick-offs to allow more live games on TV.

The inquiry follows a complaint from pay TV and broadband company Virgin Media, which claims the way the Premier League sells the rights to top flight matches means armchair fans in the UK are hit with unfair fees.

The net result is that clubs like Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City are sharing in billions of pounds from fans whose passion and loyalty is being abused.

Currently only 41per cent of Premier League games – 154 out of 380 – are broadcast live in a season. It is claimed this system of rationing leads to higher prices for armchair fans.

By contrast all games played in the top leagues on Spain, Germany, France and Italy are broadcast live.

Virgin calculates that the minimum monthly cost of watching live Premier League games on the sports channels of Sky and BT comes in at £51.

That works out at £612 a year, which is more than four times higher than the BBC licence fee of £145.50, which covers all of its many TV and radio channels, including Match of the Day.

The £51 figure is much higher than the £21 month charge football fans in Germany must pay to see top flight teams such as the Bayern Munich and Dortmund in the Bundesliga.

It is also more than double the £25 charged in Italy to watch Serie A, and compares to £18 in Spain to follow Barcelona and Real Madrid and just £10 a month in France.

Research commissioned by Virgin found more than 15per cent of viewers say they could not watch the games they wanted through their TV provider, while 25per cent found that games were not included in their pay TV subscription.

Virgin argues that the way the Premier League packages and sells the TV rights to football in this country works to artificially inflate the price.

As a result, the cost of Premier League domestic live TV rights increased by 70per cent to a staggering £3 billion over three years in the last auction. It is predicted to rise by a further 60per cent when they are sold next time.

It also means there is absolutely no chance of live Premier League games ever returning to free-to-air terrestrial TV channels like the BBC and ITV ever again.

While the sports channel subscriptions are extortionate enough in themselves, BT and Sky have also been accused of putting up many other charges for all its customers in order to cover the millions of pounds they have paid to the Premier League.

Virgin Media claims the current regime causes ‘significant consumer harm’ resulting from escalating rights costs.

The inquiry comes after Virgin Media, of which Sir Richard Branson is a shareholder, complained about the way TV rights are sold

Chief executive, Tom Mockridge, welcomed the Ofcom inquiry, saying: ‘The Premier League is a global success story and one of the UK’s greatest exports and everyone wants that to remain the case.

‘The fact remains that fans in the UK pay the highest prices in Europe to watch the least amount of football on TV. Now is the right time to look again at the way live rights are sold to make football even more accessible.

‘We look forward to working constructively with the Premier League, the wider industry and Ofcom to ensure a better deal for football fans.’

Ofcom said: ‘Virgin Media argues that the proportion of matches made available for live television broadcast under the current Premier League rights deals – at 41per cent – is lower than some other leading European leagues, where more matches are available for live television broadcast.

‘The complaint alleges that this contributes to higher prices for consumers of pay TV packages that include premium sport channels and for the pay TV retailers of premium sports channels.’

It said: ‘Ofcom may conduct an investigation where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is an agreement which has as its object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the UK and/or the EU.

‘Ofcom will consider whether there is a breach of the UK and/or EU competition law prohibition on agreements and decisions which restrict or distort competition.’

The regulator said it will discuss any change n the rules that leads to a change to Saturday afternoon football.

It said: ‘Ofcom understands that the scheduling of football games is important to many football fans, in particular attending 3pm kick-offs on Saturdays. The investigation will take this into account and Ofcom plans to approach the Football Supporters’ Federation and certain other supporters’ groups to understand their views.’

The Premier League said: ‘The Premier League currently sells its audio-visual rights in a way that is compatible with UK and EU competition law and will continue to do so.

‘We will be able to demonstrate that as part of this process.’
