A fiery river of lava
from the Kilauea volcano flowed inevitably towards a village on Hawaii's
Big Island on Monday night, creeping to within just 70 yards of the nearest home. 

Residents in the destructive, unstoppable path of the lava flow were told to prepare to take what they could and flee their homes as its 5 to 10 yards per hour progress meant it could impact property in Pahoa Village sometime Tuesday.

Sympathetic Hawaii County officials, meanwhile, made arrangements that would allow villagers to bear witness to the destruction of their own homes.

That accommodation is being made to 'provide for a means of closure,' Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said Monday. 'You can only imagine the frustration as well as...despair they're going through.'

Dozens of residents have been told they might have to evacuate as lava from Kilauea heads toward their homes.

The flow, which first bubbled out of the continuously
erupting Kilauea on June 27, came to a standstill in late
September but resumed its trudge several weeks ago. It has moved
about 275 yards since Sunday morning.

The leading edge of the flow, which scientists said had
narrowed to about 55 yards wide by Monday evening, has already
overrun a cemetery on its path toward Pahoa village, a historic
former sugar plantation consisting of small shops and homes with
a population of about 800 people.

'We're a resilient community, so we'll get through this,'
said Tiffany Edwards Hunt, a small business owner and county
council election candidate. 'But as a mom, I'm uneasy,
anxious, and fearful.'

Oliveira said
residents whose homes may be razed by the lava will be allowed
into the restricted area to take photos and video for insurance
purposes.

Most residents have left or have made arrangements to go somewhere else if necessary. Oliveira said he doesn't anticipate having to issue a mandatory evacuation order.

Menacing: GMA anchor Rob Marciano stands in the path of Kilauea's lava. By early Tuesday, the flow's front was fewer than 100 yards from Pahoa Village homes

Unstoppable: The path of lava from Kilauea moved at 5 to 10 yards per hour over the weekend and into Monday, by which point the front was fewer than 100 yards from the nearest home in imperiled Pahoa Village on the big island of Hawaii

Additional dangers: Methane explosions have also occurred near the front of the lava flow, said Janet Babb, a geologist and USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory spokeswoman, likely due to decomposing vegetation which produce pools of the gas under the surface

Path of destruction: Two roads have been closed and the American Red Cross has opened an emergency shelter, Mayor Billy Kenoi's office said.Crews have been building temporary access roads and trying to protect Highway 130, a route traveled by as many as 10,000 cars a day

The couple living in the house closest to the flow have left but have been returning periodically to gather belongings, Oliveira said. 'They are out of the property and awaiting the events to unfold.'

Imperiled resident Imelda Raras, said she and her husband are ready to go to a friend's home if officials tell them they should leave.

'We are still praying,' she said. 'I hope our home will be spared.'

The Kilauea volcano has erupted from its Pu'u O'o vent since
1983. The last home destroyed by lava on the Big Island was in
Kalapana in 2012, according to Big Island Civil Defense. 

SLOW CREEP

Scientists began warning the public about the lava on Aug. 22. At the time, residents were cleaning up from a tropical storm that made landfall over the Puna district, toppling trees and knocking out electricity.

The lava has advanced and slowed as residents waited and watched.

Kilauea volcano, one of the world's most active, has been erupting continuously since 1983.

This is not an eruption at the caldera, the things that make for stunning pictures as red lava spews from the mountaintop.

Decomposition of vegetation in the lava's path has created methane gas, which if it accumulates and is ignited by heat can cause a blast, Babb said.

'It's not a massive explosion,' she said. 'But it can dislodge rocks. It can hurl large rocks several feet.'

Crater:  Kilauea's volcano Halema'uma'u crater billows into the sky at the Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. The volcano has been erupting continuously for 30 years. Its Pu'u O'o fissure is the source of the current dangers in Pahoa Village

WHO IS AT RISK?

Initially, the lava seemed headed for the Kaohe Homesteads, a widespread, sparsely populated subdivision in the Puna district.

It reached vacant lots in the subdivision before it stalled. It skirted the northeast corner of the subdivision and then headed toward Pahoa.

Pahoa has small-town, quaint and historic charm, but it's 'the only town in a commercial sense in lower Puna,' said state Sen. Russell Ruderman, who represents Puna and runs a natural food store in Pahoa.

Because the lava could change direction, any community in Puna is at risk. Everyone in the district lives on the volcano. The lush, agricultural district is about a 30-minute drive from the coastal town of Hilo.

The lava that crossed Apaa Street is on the other end of the street from the Raras home, but they're bracing for the possibility the lava will spread or change directions.

COUNTRY-STYLE LIVING

Why would someone live on an active volcano? Unlike Honolulu, the state's biggest city on the island of Oahu, the Big Island's Puna region has affordable land and offers a more rural way of life.

Located on the island's southeast side, the area is made up of subdivisions that have unpaved roads of volcanic rock.

Many live off the grid on solar power and catchment water systems.

Residents know the risks as there are special insurance requirements to buy land in certain lava zones.

PREPARATIONS

Sporadic suspensions in the lava's movement gave emergency crews time to work on building alternate routes to town in the event the flow covers the main road and highway.

Crews near the leading edge have been wrapping power poles with concrete rings as a layer of protection from lava heat.

Officials worried that if lava crosses Highway 130, it would isolate Puna from the rest of the island.

'Puna will be divided into the north side of the flow and the south side of the flow,' Ruderman said.

Raras said they began putting their belongings in storage in September. What they aren't able to take with them, they're photographing for insurance purposes.

Unpredictable: No one knows when Kilauea will stop erupting. In the 1990s, about 200 homes were destroyed by lava flows from the volcano, which is one of the world's most active. The last evacuations came in 2011

HOW LONG WILL THE RISK REMAIN?

No one knows if the lava flow will stop, change direction or hit homes.

In the 1990s, about 200 homes were destroyed by lava flows from Kilauea.

The last evacuations from the volcano came in 2011. One home was destroyed and others were threatened before the lava changed course.

CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE

Kilauea is home to Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess. Some residents expressed anger at suggestions to divert the flow. They say it's culturally insensitive to interfere with Pele's will.

YOUNG VOLCANO

The U.S. Geological Survey says Kilauea is the youngest volcano on Hawaii Island. Officials estimate Kilauea's first eruption happened between 300,000 and 600,000 years ago.

DON'T CANCEL VACATION PLANS

The lava isn't a reason to cancel a Big Island vacation because it's an isolated event.

Officials have warned people to stay away from the area and imposed flight restrictions because of helicopter tours hoping to see lava.
