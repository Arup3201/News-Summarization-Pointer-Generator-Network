The Duchess of Cambridge made a beeline for a group of flag-waving children as she arrived at a London Primary School this morning.

Wearing a shocking salmon pink dress by her new favourite label, Goat, Kate sank to her knees to chat to youngsters who cheered and waved the English flag. She wore her long brown locks in ringlets in a half up style.

The Duchess visited the Blessed Sacrament School in Islington, north London, to view the progress of M-PACT Plus, a project which helps address the difficult issue of addiction in families.

The children were delighted to meet her. One little four-year-old made Kate smile 
when she asked him what his favourite part of school was. Ezekiel 
quipped back: 'Lunchtime.'Â 

Kate
 asked a group of flag waving youngsters why they were so happy. And a 
little girl, Seyi, six, told her: 'I said it was because she has come to
 Blessed Sacrament school. I said I liked her dress.'

And beaming Abigail, seven, said: 'She looks good in pink.'

The Duchess launched M-PACT Plus with comedian John Bishop on a visit to Manchester in 2013 when she was pregnant with her son, Prince George.

The project is funded by The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry - the vehicle for the trio's charitable initiatives - in conjunction with Comic Relief and two charities of which Kate is royal patron, Place2be and Action on Addiction.

M-PACT Plus provides early support for school children affected by a parent's drug or alcohol misuse.

Personal involvement: The Duchess is given a tour of the school to check the progress of a charity project she helped launch last year

It involves training school staff to identify children affected by addiction and by bringing families together for an eight week pilot intervention.

A Kensington Palace spokesman said the project had been driven by a personal interest from the Duchess.

They said: 'MPACT-Plus came about as a result of The Duchess of Cambridge's desire to help children of addicted families break the cycle of addiction, and she has taken a close interest in its progress.

'Through her patronage of Action on Addiction, The Duchess of Cambridge became aware of the shattering impact of addiction, not only on those addicted, but also on their families. Research suggests that children of addicts are seven times more likely to become addicts themselves.

'The Duchess directed her charity, The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry to find a way to help. The Royal Foundation and Comic Relief commissioned research, which resulted in bringing together two charities together, Place2Be and Action on Addiction, to deliver M-PACT Plus and get specialist support to children at a young age, before problems have the potential to develop.

'Today's engagement is an opportunity for The Duchess of Cambridge to meet those delivering the programmes and discuss how the pilot is progressing.'

The Duchess met project co-ordinators and headteachers who are helping to roll out the scheme in Sunderland, Manchester, Essex and London. She then joined a private counselling session during the hour-and-a-half-long visit.

The pupils waited patiently for their chance to speak to the royal

Honest answers: Kate asked the children what they liked best about school and the responses included books and lunchtime

Kate joined John Bishop to meet members of the school and hear speeches.

The comedian had the Duchess in stitches when, during a speech to mark the occasion, he urged the assembled media not to focus on the 'style icon in their midst' - they were wearing, where their clothes were from or what hairstyle was in place - but to focus on the project.

'Basically, don't make the story about me,' he joked.

Kate burst into giggles and couldn't stop smiling throughout the rest of the comedy star's speech. After he sat down she leant over to him and whispered something, giggling again.

On a serious note, Bishop said Kate is 'genuinely committed' to the issue, and hailed the involvement of the Royal Foundation.

'What's good about it is that it will hopefully de-stigmatise the whole area. Addiction doesn't care what social class you're from. It's across the board. The levels of addiction in Knightsbridge will be as high, if not higher, than some of the most deprived areas in the country,' he said.

'I think, from the brief conversations I've had with her, she's committed to it as a person and probably even more so now as a mother, because you realise children are such fragile things and you've got to try and support them when they're at their weakest.'

The Duchess of Cambridge is well known for her polished look and perfectly quaffed hair, but she stepped away from her traditional blow dry for her visit to Blessed Sacrament School in Islington North London.

In a half-up style, Kate rang the changes with tightly wound glossy curls draped over either shoulder of her pink Goat dress.

This is opposed to the Duchess' usual style of loosely waved blow-dry.

As always her brunette locks had a high shine finish and there was not a hair out of place despite her busy day.

Hairdresser to the stars, Nicky Clarke says: 'This look is great for day old hair. The curls will stay in place much better with hair that has not been washed for a day. Perfect for a long day of meeting the public.'

He continued: 'Kate has probably been quite busy so her front lengths have grown giving the perfect base for this look.

'This style will also keep the hair off her face during the summer and gives an added something to the plainness of her dress.

'With her busy schedule, this look is perfect if your hair has grown a little too heavy at the front to wear loose as it will elongate the face. This look perks the face up and highlights Kate's cheekbones.

'It's regal, neat and well balanced and gives the 60's vibe of the dress a modern update.'

Jonathan Long of Lockonego salon in Chelsea added: 'Kate has gone for much larger curls on this occasion which can be achieved on smooth hair using a large barrel tong.

'This makes a nice change for Kate and the good thing about this style is that the curls will drop out as the day goes on, giving a less structured more relaxed look which we usually see on Kate.

'It's a great style to last all day in hot weather as the curls become more dishevelled as the day goes on. The key to this look is to start the curls a few inches from the root area to give a modern yet still classic look.'

A spokesman for Place2Be said: 'With one in three children in every classroom affected by a mental health problem, early intervention is vital. The Duchess of Cambridge became Place2Be's royal patron last year after expressing particular interest in helping to support children and families affected by mental health problems.

'At Place2Be we work with more than 80,000 children in schools across the country to provide integrated mental health support to those affected by domestic violence, abuse addiction, divorce, school transition, bullying and other complex social issues.'

Inside the school, the Duchess sat in on a steering group comprised of head teachers and charity workers involved in rolling out the M-PACT Plus scheme.

Kate, who had her hair half swept from her face, listened intently as she was updated about its success so far and was clearly interested as she asked several pertinent questions about its workings.

'Were the parents quite surprised by the things their children were saying?' she asked.

Nodding intently, she continued: 'Have you found it difficult to attract parents given the stigma that can be associated with these issues?'

She also remarked that the training being given to teachers to spot children who may have issues due to their parents' substance abuse 'gives them more confidence to approach the topics.'

'That's fantastic,' she said, as she learnt about some of the success stories so far.

As she left, the royal was presented with a work of art from a pupil. The painting was a Picasso style portrait of the Duchess cradling baby Prince George.

She appeared delighted with the gift and carried it herself back to the awaiting car.
