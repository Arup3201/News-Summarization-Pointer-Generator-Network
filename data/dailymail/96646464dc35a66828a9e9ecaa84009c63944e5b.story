It was the greatest party London had ever seen. As jubilant crowds flocked on to the streets to celebrate the end of the Second World War in Europe, few noticed a young Princess Elizabeth and her sister Margaret dancing incognito among them.

But while the future Queen did indeed do the conga through The Ritz hotel in Piccadilly, a new film is set to claim she also danced in sleazy Soho nightclubs – and ended the night being kissed by a dashing young RAF Lancaster gunner.

Girls Night Out is bound to raise eyebrows as, in real life, Princess Elizabeth, then 19, was besotted by Prince Philip, who was serving in the Far East with the Royal Navy.

The film, which stars Rupert Everett as King George VI, Emily Watson as Queen Elizabeth, Sarah Gadon as Princess Elizabeth and Bel Powley as Margaret, recounts the dramatic events on VE Day – May 8, 1945.

According to the ‘fairytale’ account by Kevin Hood and Trevor de Silva, after Elizabeth and Margaret, then 15, join in the fun at The Ritz, the younger Princess slips away from her guards and hops on a bus.

‘Princess Elizabeth has a race against time to find her,’ says Mr Hood, who was also responsible  for BBC drama Silent Witness and the Jane Austen biopic Becoming Jane.

‘When she gets on a London bus – something she has no clue how to use – she meets an RAF serviceman who comes to her rescue.

‘He is a Lancaster gunner who has had a pretty tough time of it and debates whether he is going to go AWOL or will return to his base  the next morning.

As they try to  find Margaret, they end up in a couple of sleazy Soho nightclubs. She does help him and as a consequence of that her real identity  is revealed.’

With filming already under way at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire and Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire, Mr Hood admits the decision about whether the future queen will be shown sharing a romantic kiss with the young gunner is under debate.

Indeed, film companies Lionsgate and Ecosse, which produced the critically acclaimed Mrs Brown – about the relationship between Queen Victoria and her manservant John Brown – plan to shoot alternative endings and will not make a decision on which to include until closer to the film’s release date next year.

While Mr Hood insists the film will be ‘a respectful’ retelling of an event which had huge importance in the Queen’s life, some Palace watchers are less impressed. Royal biographer Penny Junor said: ‘If it’s pure fiction it’s not a good idea. A film that mixes fact and fiction is a  cop-out. They’ve taken liberties.’

But Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said: ‘With the success of The Queen’s Speech and The Queen, it is a good time to do a bit of Royal movie-making.

‘The fact that the makers are debating whether Princess Elizabeth should be kissed show me  they are very conscious of how they portray the story. There has to be a bit of poetic licence.’

In her diary entry, Elizabeth wrote of the night: ‘Cheered parents on balcony. Up to St James’s Street Piccadilly, great fun.

'We walked through the streets, a line of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, swept along on a tide of happiness.’

The sisters returned to the Palace in the early hours having maintained their anonymity, but were so caught up in the excitement that they ventured out again the next day.

Elizabeth’s diary for May 9 says: ‘Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Pall Mall, walked simply miles. Saw parents on balcony at 12.30am – ate, partied, bed 3am!’

Looking back at their adventure, the Queen’s cousin Margaret Rhodes, who acted as their chaperone on VE Day, admitted: ‘It was a unique burst of personal freedom.  A Cinderella moment in reverse in which they could pretend they were ordinary and unknown.’

However, she never mentioned a kiss.

A day to remember: More than a million people took to the streets including in London's Piccadilly Circus
