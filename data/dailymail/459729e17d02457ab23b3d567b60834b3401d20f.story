A super-slimmer lost an incredible 19st in just 18 months after his wife joked he looked like Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars.

Alan Oates weighed a massive 33st 7lbs and had a 68 inch waist.

He was so large he needed additional oxygen for 15 hours a day to help him breathe.

Alan Oates, 55, decided to overhaul his diet and lifestyle when he saw this unflattering picture of himself

Mr Oates lost 19st to drop from 33st 7lbs to 14st 4lbs in 18 months - he was losing more than a stone a month

The former lorry driver piled on the pounds munching on fry ups, fish and chips, crisps, curries and Chinese takeaways.

But the 55-year-old revealed that it was a picture of him balancing a tiny-looking laptop on his enormous stomach that made him realise he needed to change his ways.

He joined Slimming World in January 2012 and has now dropped to a much healthier 14st 4lbs.

His incredible diet led to him losing the equivalent of more than a stone every month.

‘I've got a new lease of life,’ said Mr Oates. ‘My wife tells me she has finally got her husband back.

‘My wife has a photo of me which I hate. My laptop is balancing on my big belly, and she joked that I look like Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars in it.

‘It was taken in January 2012, around the time I joined Slimming World. I hate that picture.

‘If I had known I looked that big before I may have done something sooner.’

The father-of-one from Tamworth, who is now a transport planner, admits he piled on the pounds after leaving the army in 1988 and becoming a lorry driver.

He said: ‘I started eating loads of rubbish food - takeaways, crisps, and fast food, and doing zero exercise.

‘I would spend two or three nights a week away from home and would end up getting takeaways because it was easy.

Before his weight loss, Mr Oates was so unhealthy he needed extra oxygen 15 hours a day to help him breathe

Mr Oates (pictured with his wife, Helen) said: 'I've got a new lease of life. My wife tells me that she has finally got her husband back'

‘When I got home my wife would be at work, so I would get something processed out of the freezer - it was laziness.

‘In the end, I struggled with a short walk round the supermarket.’

A typical day would have seen Mr Oates eat nothing until 11am, when he would have a bacon and egg sandwich, closely followed by lunch of fish and chips then dinner of a processed ready meal.

His only hobby was his twice-weekly after dinner darts matches at the pub, where he would have another meal.

Eventually, persuaded by his wife Helen, 51, Mr Oates visited a doctor who suggested a gastric band.

But he refused, and determined to lose the weight himself, he visited Slimming World with his friend Penny in January 2012.

‘I think gastric bands are a short fix. I know of people who have had them and afterwards they return to their old eating habits,’ he said.

‘I knew I had to change my lifestyle, rather than have a short-term fix.’

Following the new eating plan, Mr Oates ditched the crisps and fried food, and began cooking from scratch.

He swapped the stodgy dinners and fatty fry ups for fruit and stuck religiously to healthy Slimming World recipes.

And his hard work paid off.

When he was at his heaviest, Mr Oates was offered a gastric band but he turned down the offer as he viewed it as a short-term solution. He decided he needed to change his lifestyle instead

On May 7 this year Mr Oates was named the second 'Greatest Loser 2014' at a Slimming World ceremony in London.

He said: ‘I was made to feel really welcome at the group, and I lost 12lbs in the first week. I still go every week religiously.’

Now Mr Oates has also had a lifestyle overhaul, and enjoys walking and swimming with his wife.

He said: ‘We still have a Sunday roast dinner every week, but we cook it differently.

‘I walk nearly everywhere now, whereas before I would drive the two minute walk to the shop because I would be out of breath.

‘There's no way I'm putting this weight back on!’
