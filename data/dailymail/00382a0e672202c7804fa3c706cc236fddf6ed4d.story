Arsenal stars Per Mertesacker, Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have swapped the football pitch for amateur dramatics, appearing in a 'mockumentary' video which sees actors - including Ewen Macintosh of The Office - take on the roles of their fictional relatives.

‘Face to Face with the Arsenal Family’ introduces larger-than-life ‘family’ members of each of the players, telling the story of their journey to matchday at The Emirates.

The film has been released by Europcar, the Official Car and Van Rental partner to Arsenal, and begins with champion baker ‘Trudy Mertesacker’ (played by Lillian Schiffer) being introduced by her 'brother' Per.

Trudy always attends matches to watch her famous brother in action but believes that baking is more challenging than football. 

Then, Wilshere reluctantly introduce ‘Uncle Kenny Wilshere’ (played by Grant Davis).

A former schoolboy footballer who now works as a plumber, as well as being a keen poet, Uncle Kenny travels to The Emirates to watch his star nephew in action but secretly harbours desires to play for the club himself.

The short film also features ‘Darren Oxlade-Chamberlain’ (played by Ewen MacIntosh), the plane-spotting cousin of winger Alex. Whilst Alex is a confident, outgoing member of his family, Darren is affectionately known as ‘The Shrub’ because he can stand still for long periods of time, key for plane spotting.

As well as ‘starring’ in the mockumentary, which follows the players’ make-believe relatives travelling to The Emirates on matchday, the players had input into the scripts and storyboards.

And they not only appeared as themselves but also as their ‘relatives’, through their faces being digitally super-imposed onto the faces of the actors playing those parts. The family ‘resemblance’ is therefore easy to see.

Talking about the acting experience to create the video, Oxlade-Chamberlain said: 'I enjoyed the chance to do a bit of acting in the video. I did drama at school and had to drop acting for football so quite enjoyed the chance to relive my past.'

Wilshere added: 'I’ve done a bit of acting in the past but it’s not something that comes naturally to me. I need more practice but enjoyed seeing the creation of Uncle Kenny.'

Joking about which of the three players was the most natural actor, Mertesacker said: 'Oh that would be me, for sure. I’ve done a bit of acting before but this video was something different, involved more expression and I felt comfortable and enjoyed the experience.”'

When asked who the players would like to play them in movies of their lives, Wilshere opted for Daniel Craig, Oxlade-Chamberlain suggested Denzel Washington, but said: 'It would be a bit of a stretch and he would be dropping down a peg or two.' Mertesacker revealed it would require 'a big lad, [NBA champion] Dirk Nowitzki.'
