A man has been arrested and charged with attempted rape after attacking a woman in the toilet of a New York gay bar.

Ricardo Lambert, 34, ambushed his 34-year-old victim as she left the bathroom, pushed her to the floor, ripped off her underwear, and used it to choke her until she lost consciousness, police claim.

His attack in Flaming Saddles bar, in the Hell's Kitchen district, was only stopped when a security guard walked past.

Lambert fled the scene clutching the woman's underwear before officials could determine what had happened.

Tonight, police revealed they have tracked him down and he is now in custody.

'Security walked over to the restroom area after noticing a man leaning over a passed-out woman, and the guy just took off when he saw them,' a police source told the New York Post.

'It was pretty clear what he was going to do to her.'

The woman is said to be in a stable condition and not seriously injured after being taken to a nearby hospital. 

CCTV footage taken moments before the attack at 10.30pm on October 3 shows Lambert, a short, thin man with dreadlocks and a gray hat, coolly walking towards the bathrooms. 

'All we care about is the safety of our customers and employees and the residents of Hell's Kitchen,' the manager said.

Flaming Saddles is known for its dancing cowboy bartenders and was named the best gay bar in 2012 by New York Magazine.
