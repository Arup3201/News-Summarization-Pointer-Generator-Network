An original ‘Golden Ticket’ used in the 1971 movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is to be sold at auction for an estimated £20,000.

Children who found the rare tickets hidden in chocolate bars won a tour of the factory, including poor Charlie Bucket and greedy Augustus Gloop.

It bears the inscription ‘In your wildest dreams you could not imagine the marvellous surprises that await you!’ and is printed on gold foil paper.

The film, which became a cult favourite, was based on the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl and starred Gene Wilder. It also spawned a remake starring Johnny Depp in 2005.

The ticket will be sold at the Profiles in History auction, which features amazing musical and film props and costumes.

The famous Superman leotard worn by Christopher Reeve likely to reach £50,000 when it goes under the hammer.

It features the trademark ‘S’ on the chest, red cape and blue tights.

Re-make: The story was also re-imagined in the 2005 film starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka

The auction house describes it as 'easily one of the most recognizable costumes in Hollywood history'.

Batman fans can snap up the caped crusader’s rubber suit worn by Michael Keaton as he stalked the streets of Gotham City in Batman Returns.

The suit has a guide price of £30,000.

And the original furry Chewbacca head from Star Wars has an estimated value of £50,000.

The brown haired wookiee allied himself with Harrison Ford’s Hans Solo after the smuggler saved his life.

The headpiece was worn by 7ft 3ins British actor Peter Mayhew in the original trilogy.

Joseph Maddalena, from Profiles in History, said: 'The scope and breadth of the collection is astonishing, having assembled instantly recognisable costumes, props, and memorabilia from the greatest stars and characters of film and music.'

The auction will be held in California, United States, on July 28.
