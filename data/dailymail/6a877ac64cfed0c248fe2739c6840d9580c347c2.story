Half a million drivers have been caught using their mobile phone while driving and Glasgow in the worst place in the country. 

The latest figures were released by the DVLA and reveal 28,000 motorists in the Scottish city have been caught. 

That is nearly double the number for the next city on the list which is Birmingham where 14,000 people have had points slapped on their licence.

Liverpool, Motherwell and Sheffield also fall in the top five worst offending areas, according to The Sun on Sunday.

Road safety group Brake is calling on motorists to switch off their phones before driving.

Julie Townsend, deputy chief executive of Brake, said: ‘We're living in an age when being constantly connected is the norm. 

'More and more of us have smartphones, and find it hard to switch off, even for a minute.

'While there are enormous benefits to this new technology, it's also posing dangerous temptations to drivers to divert their concentration away from the critical task at hand, often putting our most vulnerable road users in danger.

'Many people who wouldn't dream of drink-driving are succumbing to using their phone and other distractions while driving, oblivious that the effect can be similar and the consequences just as horrific.’

The number of UK drivers who now have a minimum three points on their licence with the code CU80 now stands at 574,955. 

Of these, 6.5 per cent have six points or more.

Meanwhile, 62 per cent of children aged between the ages of seven and 11 report being driven by someone talking on the phone and 79 per cent have seen drivers on mobile phones outside their school or home.

Brake also highlighted research showing 98 per cent of drivers are unable to divide their time without it affecting performance and that mobile phone use at the wheel as well as eating, drinking and smoking are all proven to increase the risk of a crash.
