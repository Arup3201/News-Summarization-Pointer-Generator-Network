Former Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan Jr is sitting in the jail that was named in his honour after pleading guilty to felony possession of methamphetamine and the misdemeanour of soliciting prostitution earlier this week.

But now, stunning police surveillance video shows the moment the former sheriff of the year is swarmed by police and arrested in a sting operation.

In the video, Sullivan is seen entering the room of one confidential informant, who made a deal to have sex with him in exchange for meth.

The sting: Sullivan can be seen handing the informant black underwear and a shirt

The informant said Sullivan had done this ‘time and time again’ – but once the crimes were committed to video, the arrest was made.

The 69-year-old former sheriff was sentenced to 30 days in jail, with two years’ probation. He was also fined $1,100. However, the rest of his charges were dropped in the plea deal.

The video was released only two days after he pleaded guilty.

It begins with undercover officers doing a check on the equipment and explaining that they’re waiting for Sullivan.

Around the five-minute mark, Sullivan enters the bedroom and asks the informant to try on a pair of underwear, saying: ‘See if these might fit you.’

As the informant is seen looking at the underwear, Sullivan says: ‘The problem with that one is, it doesn’t have any real elastic. Maybe too big for you. Try it as we mess around.’

He then takes out a laptop and lounges on the bed, watching a gay porno on his computer.

Shame: He once served on a methamphetamine task force

At one point in the video, the informant asks if Sullivan tried any of the meth he’s giving to him, to which Sullivan responds: ‘No, it’s a social issue, why smoke it yourself?’

Minutes later, several police burst into the bedroom, detonating a flash-bang grenade.

Sullivan does not resist arrest, but does ask that the police be mindful of his ‘bad leg’ – and ask them not to break it.

According to 7News, the video was shot November 29.

Deputy Attorney General Michael Dougherty, who investigated the former sheriff, said the law enforcement officer’s actions ‘disgraces the badge.’

Mr Dougherty told the court that Sullivan used the power associated with his position to garner the trust of gay meth users in the area.

He said: ‘(Sullivan) became a manipulator, someone who used his position.’

Sullivan served as the county sheriff from 1984 until he retired in 2002, and took part in the Colorado-wide methamphetamine task force in 2000.

After retiring, he became director of safety and security for Cherry Creek Schools before stepping down in 2008.

According to The Denver Post, there were no public hints to show that Sullivan began using meth. However, the shamed former sheriff promises to make amends.

He said: ‘I plan to seek forgiveness from those that I have harmed.’

Reading from a statement before his sentence, he said: ‘I apologise to this court, this country, and my family. There is no excuse for my behaviour.’
