He is arguably England's greatest ever writer, using tens of thousands of words to craft his plays and poetry.

Scholars say William Shakespeare was among the most educated men of his time, using around a quarter of those words used in the English language during his lifetime.

He invented many of the words that make up his 37 plays, but for others he turned to the Latin and Greek languages for inspiration.

Two booksellers in New York believe this dictionary, which dates to 1580, was once owned by the poet and playwright William Shakespeare

Experts say it will take months, if not years to assess whether the annotations adorning the book, were written by the Bard of Avon. Only six confirmed examples of his handwriting exist, making comparisons very difficult

But like many contemporary writers, experts have long believed Shakespeare turned to a reference book as a guide.

Today, as the literary world marks the 450th anniversary of the Bard of Avon's birth, two booksellers from New York have revealed they may have the answer to the mystery of where he learned his vast vocabulary.

George Koppelman and Daniel Wechsler say they have discovered the writer's dictionary, annotated by his own hand.

For more than 50 years, experts have believed Shakespeare consulted a 1580 dictionary published in London and known as An Alvearie or Quadruple Dictionary.

'The ordinariness of the individual 
annotations is, to me, precisely what argues for their authenticity'

- Expert Henry Wessells

Cambridge Latin tutor John Baret was responsible for publishing the dictionary, in English, Latin, Greek and French - giving it the name Quadruple Dictionary.

Many experts believe Shakespeare could have used Baret's work to craft his own.

Noted Shakespearean scholar T.W. Baldwin asserts in William Shakespere’s Small Latine & Lesse Greeke: 'Baret was in effect the standard English dictionary of Shakespeare’s schooldays, and must have had powerful influence in shaping the English definitions of Shakespeare’s generation.

'But it is not likely that Shakespeare would have preserved the patterns so accurately if he had not himself turned many a time and oft to Baret for his varied synonyms.'

And so, when in 2008 when a book bearing the 1580 publication date appeared on eBay, it caught the eye of Mr Koppelman.

The seller's reference to 'contemporary annotations', wet his appetite to find out more.

He paid $4,300 for the book, the New Yorker reported.

The 450th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare is being celebrated today. The Bard was born on April 23, 1564 and died on the same day 52 years later

Once in his possession, he and Mr Wechsler studied its annotations for clues as to the author, leading them to conclude the scribbles and markings adorning the pages are indeed those of Shakespeare himself.

The pair have published their own book, Shakespeare's Beehive: An Annotated Elizabethean Dictionary Comes To Light, reproducing parts of the Alvearie, while debating its authenticity.

The pair said: 'Over the course of discovery, it became impossible for us to neglect a host of personal markers that run throughout the annotated book - finger prints left by the annotator that reveal a personality and hint at an identity.

'In addition, there is a preponderance of natural history annotations, interest in the language of clothing and costume of the period critical to stagecraft, and annotations that connect with our understanding of Shakespeare’s father and his profession.'

But proving the dictionary is in fact that of Shakespeare, could be harder than it would appear. He is known to have signed just six legal documents, and is thought to have hand-written only three pages of an unpublished play.

While there is no categorical evidence of when William Shakespeare was born, historians widely believe today to be the 450th anniversary of his birth.

It is known that the playwright was baptized on April 26, 1564 and that he died on his birthday 52 years later.

The poet and writer was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, the third child of eight to his middle-class parents, John and Mary Shakespeare.

Over the next 30 years he would produce 37 plays, and countless poems and other works, making him one of the world's most celebrated playwright five centuries later.

Across the UK arts organisations have marked the 450th anniversary.

Today the Royal Shakespeare Company theatre in Stradtford will host a fireworks display on its rooftop, which is set to paint an eight-metre high portrait of the Bard in the night's sky.

At London's Victoria and Albert Museum, the Live Canon Ensemble will recite all of the Bard's 154 sonnets as part of an all-day event.

With so few examples of his handwriting to compare against the annotations in the dictionary, experts have questioned its authenticity.

Mr Koppelman and Mr Wechsler say they have discovered annotations that suggest borrowed ideas from one of his most well-known plays Hamlet.

Another antiquarian Henry Wessells, who had access to Koppelman and Wechsler's early work, has anaylsed the arguement that the book is Shakespeare's Alvearie.

He said in a blog post: 'The ordinariness of the individual 
annotations is, to me, precisely what argues for their authenticity: 
they form not a rough draft of any single text, but a tool kit.

'The 
connections between Baret’s word store and the plays and poems all point
 to the transformation that occurs in the space between an author’s 
notes and composition: the play of language.'

But others have urged caution, throwing doubt on the idea that the annotations were penned by the playwright.

Of the six confirmed fragments of Shakespeare's handwriting only the words 'by me' and his signature 'William Shakespeare' were written by him.

The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington D.C. is the largest collection of printed Shakespeare material in the world.

It also has a huge archive of handwritten and printed material from the Bard's contemporaries.

The library's director Michael Witmore, and curator of manuscripts Heather Wolfe, said in a blog on Monday that they cannot yet get excited about the alleged new piece of Shakespeare's history, The Atlantic reported.

'At this point,' they write, 'We 
as individual scholars feel that it is premature to join Koppelman and 
Wechsler in what they have described as their "leap of faith".'

They said there are a number of different research methods that experts must use to confirm the identity of the dictionary's annotator.

The Folger Library in Washington D.C. holds the largest collection of printed Shakespeare material in the world

The library's director Michael Witmore, and curator of manuscripts Heather Wolfe said in a blog that they feel it is 'premature to join Koppelman and Weschler in what they have described as their "leap of faith".'

They include paleography, or the study of old script. The handwriting used to mark the dictionary is italic-style.

Almost all of the existing examples of Shakespeare's handwriting are in another style, 'secretary'. Mr Witmore and Ms Wolfe say other writers in the 16th century are known to have used examples of both italic and secretary, keeping alive the possibility it is Shakespeare's Alvearie.

Verifying Shakespeare as the owner of the book is likely to take months, if not years, of research before experts will be confident to say beyond any doubt that the Bard himself scrawled the notes in the margins as he wrote his great masterpieces.

Responding the the skepticism Mr Koppelman and Mr Weschler added: 'The question is, does it make sense to imagine any book extensively written in by Shakespeare to realistically survive entirely unnoticed to the present day.

'In simplest terms (our claim) goes as follows: with Baret’s Alvearie we are faced with a book that has not once been reprinted since 1580. A most obscure book. A humble copy.

'An extensive network of annotations that, through obscurity and a lack of attention, comes to light only now, never previously studied or speculated upon.

'These are the basic stepping ­‐stones to providing plausibility to the dream that such a monumental discovery is possible. The rest is in the evidence.'
