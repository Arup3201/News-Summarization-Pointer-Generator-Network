A pet pig who lives in a pub with her owners has been banned from the bar after she started stealing pints and headbutting customers.

The micro-pig, who goes by the name of Frances Bacon, eats, sleeps and drinks at the Conquering Hero in south London.

But the four-year-old soon started polishing off the dregs from customers' discarded beer glasses and breaking into the bar's snack supply.

But she soon started finishing off the dregs from discarded beer glasses and helping herself to the pork scratchings 

The pig has a penchant for pork scratchings - but 'doesn't have a clue that between pork scratchings are her relatives', according to Mrs Taylor-Ross

Customers at the West Norwood establishment had also started letting the Vietnamese Pot-Belly take a sip from their beer or cider.

The pig, who must be kept on a strictly vegetarian diet, even recently broke into the bar and ate a big bag of dry-roasted peanuts, making her thirsty for days. 

Landlords Ian and Vicky Taylor-Ross only realised what was going on when the animal - who has her own space in the beer garden - started headbutting customers in the legs.

The couple has now warned customers not to serve the pig any alcohol in a bid to help  clamp down on her drinking.

They have also had to put their pork scratchings, crisps and peanuts on a higher shelf under lock and key in case Frances attempts to snuffle them. 

Mr Taylor-Ross, 43, said Frances has become a bit of a 'loveable menace.'

Mr Taylor-Ross, pictured with the pig, said he and his wife were 'keeping a closer eye on her now'

'She's lovely - definitely our favourite regular. We've had to bar her from having any beer though,' he said.

'She managed to nick a pint or two and then started butting into people. But we're keeping a closer eye on her now and that won't happen again.'

Mrs Taylor-Ross added: 'We have had to put locks on the bar to stop her coming in and stealing crisps and scratchings. She has got an incredible sense of smell.

'She eats a special dry feed for micro-pigs and eats all our vegetable peelings - as long as she's not eating her relatives it's OK. 

The couple said the pig is a fantastic pet for children Tavis, nine, Ruby, six, and three-year-old Mary (pictured)

Mr Taylor-Ross, 43, said Frances has become a bit of a 'loveable menace' and is popular with customers

The pig has her own area in the beer garden at the pub (pictured) near West Norwood, south London,

'She doesn't have a clue that between pork scratchings are her relatives. We used to keep them on the lower shelves but we had to move everything a couple of weeks ago.

'She broke in and ate a bag of dry-roasted peanuts. She didn't eat for two days after that, but she was incredibly thirsty.

'She is also up for drinking beer - she will try and get hold of anything that's there, especially cider.'

The couple, who are often seen taking Frances for a walk on a lead, said the six-stone pig is a fantastic pet for children Tavis, nine, Ruby, six, and three-year-old Mary.

She is also a big hit with their customers.

She added: 'Most of our punters really like her but it can be a bit weird for people especially as we are in London. She's just like a dog really, only craftier.'
