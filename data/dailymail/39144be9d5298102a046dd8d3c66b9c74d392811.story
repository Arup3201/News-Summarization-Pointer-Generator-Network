It is one of the most famous phone calls of the summer, a conversation that lasted less than two minutes but went viral on the internet.

Being granted an audience with Barack Obama could lead some to get an inflated sense of their own worth but, as you listen to Tim Howard relay the story of the day he and Clint Dempsey chatted with the President of the United States, one thing is quickly apparent.

Everton’s goalkeeper may have found requests for autographs and pictures increasing, while the days when he could slip back to America and relax in relative anonymity may be over, but this episode has not changed him one bit.

Top save: Everton and USA goalkeeper Tim Howard was USA's star player during the World Cup in Brazil

Phonecall: US President Barack Obama had a conversation with Howard to congratulate him

Success: US goalkeeper Tim Howard was telephoned by President Barack Obama after the World Cup

‘I’m fortunate because 99.9 per cent of people don’t get to speak to him,’ says Howard, as he revisits the events that took place after the USA’s interests in the World Cup were ended by Belgium. ‘I’ve met the President once before when we went to the White House, so to speak to him was really cool.

‘He watched it with his family and his daughters. He said he was proud of us and the team effort and it was exciting, thrilling, he was on the edge of his seat. It was cool that he was so excited.

‘I think I played well against a real tough Belgium team but I’m an old dog, I don’t get too excited. In 2010 we lost in the round of 16 and in 2014 we lost in the round of 16. We were poo-pooed then and we’re celebrated now. But we still lost in the round of 16, so it’s all a little bit lost on me.

‘We lost a game of football which we could have won at the end. We missed a golden chance and could have done it but I still don’t get caught up in all the mass hysteria.’

Howard chose to reveal this week that he is taking a break from international football to spend more time at home after 12 years of criss-crossing the Atlantic. If it is good news for his family, it is also good news for Everton.

New season: Tim Howard has returned to Everton and is hoping to have a successful campaign on Merseyside

Record: Tim Howard has kept 116 clean sheets since signing for Everton in 2006 from Manchester United

Form: Howard is playing the best football of his career and is hoping to continue that with Everton this season

As he showed during that breathless journey in Brazil, when his saves almost took the USA to the last eight, Howard is operating at his peak, thriving from long hours in the gym and reaping the benefits of the Paleo Diet, which advocates eating lean meat and fish while avoiding dairy and grain foods.

He also has clarity. Howard intends to retire when his current contract with Everton expires in four years’ time - the ambition is to finish, if possible, after one last hurrah at the World Cup in Russia - but before then, there are targets to be met.

His 116 clean sheets since moving from Manchester United in 2006 are the fourth best figures in club history - another five will move him beyond the fabled Ted Sagar, who played for Everton before and after the Second World War - while his durability and consistency will almost certainly take him into the top 10 most appearances before his time is done.

Above all, though, there are ambitions for the team as a whole. Everton came within a whisker of qualifying for the Champions League last season and the club has spent big this summer, smashing their transfer record for Romelu Lukaku. Howard knew that would happen soon after Lukaku had ended his interest in the World Cup.

‘We both got pulled for doping after the game in Salvador,’ Howard reveals. ‘I was in doping control and I was happy for him as a person because I regard the guys at Everton like my family. I love those guys. It was heartbreaking to lose but I was oddly happy for him.

‘I believe in him and love him as a person. He is not arrogant, he is a good person. We talked about our family, we didn’t talk about the game, we were just standing there trying to drink water, your mind is racing, he is looking forward and I am looking back.

‘We spoke a little about what was next, he said he had had some good conversations with Roberto (Martinez) so I was encouraged by that. I wanted to go cry in the locker room and he wanted to celebrate.

‘As much as I felt his joy, he felt my pain. We both peed and we left. I don’t think he needed me to tell him (how much we wanted him to sign), he had spoken to the manager — we made our case last year. I didn’t have to beat him over the head.’

Lukaku was instrumental in April’s 3-0 demolition of Arsenal and he will have a major role to play on Saturday evening when Arsene Wenger brings his side back to Merseyside. That performance set the barometer for what Everton can do under manager Martinez and Howard wants more of the same.

‘We switched things up last season and really hurt them, says Howard. ‘Will they come to defend against that or will they be trying to play straight up? I don’t know. Our job is to make being at Goodison an uncomfortable afternoon.’
