Police in Connecticut have appealed for witnesses to the brutal murder of a promising Yale student exactly 16 years after she was killed.

The body of Suzanne Jovin, a 21-year-old political science major from Goettingen, Germany, was found  slumped on a curb with 17 stab wounds in the East Rock neighborhood on December 4 1998.  

Investigators never caught her murderer but say they still have not given up hope that the culprit will one day be snared and brought to justice.

Cold case: Yale student Suzanne Jovin was brutally stabbed to death 17 times on December 4, 1998

At the time of the killing, several witnesses said they heard a man and a woman rowing loudly outside the Eli Whitney Luxury Apartments, about 20 minutes before the 911 call reporting that Jovin had been stabbed, Jack Edwards, chief investigator on the case for the Connecticut Chief State's Attorney, told CBS' 48 Hours' Crimesider.

He said police want to speak with a couple spotted leaving the building and walking past them. 

While detectives say they have no new leads, they are hoping to use the 16th anniversary of Jovin's death to bring the case back into the public eye and jog the memories of anyone who was in the area that night.

'We're trying to find out if any of those people may remember that night,' Edwards said. 'It's a little bit vague - it would be important for us to locate any of these people.'

The Political Science major, an American born in Germany, was fluent in four languages, sang in the Bach Society Orchestra, had co-founded Yale's German club and invested her time volunteering with programs to tutor inner-city students and help mentally challenged adults.

On that fateful Friday, Suzanne Jovin had spent much of the night organizing a social event for Best Buddies, an organization that pairs college students with mentally disabled adults. She had been volunteering with the group since her freshman year.

After the event wrapped up, she returned to her apartment at around 8:45pm. Friends had seen Jovin in her room at that time and invited her to join them for a movie but she had declined saying she needed to hit the books.

But at 9:25pm, she was spotted leaving the campus near Phelps Gate, the main entrance to Yale.

Less than an hour later, at 9:55pm her bloodied body was discovered by residents in a quiet neighborhood near campus. 

Though the young woman was killed in an upscale area, relatively early in the evening, there were no witnesses to the crime and no significant clues that have led police to a prime suspect.

Area residents said they heard a man and woman arguing shortly before they heard a woman screaming. Minutes later Jovin's body was discovered.

Investigators have said they believe the student knew her killer, who most likely approached the girl from behind. The killer, who they believe to be male, forcefully stabbed Jovin 17-times, thrusting the knife into her skull so severely that the tip of the knife broke off and was lodged in her head. The killer also slit her throat.

'We have lights on every single street here. … It's not secluded. I just couldn't imagine that anything like that could happen, number one in the neighborhood and then certainly not there,' LaJeune Oxley, a resident who lives at the corner of Edgehill and East Rock Roads where Jovin's body was found, told Vanity Fair in 2007.
