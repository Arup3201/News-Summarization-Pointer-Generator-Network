Opinion: Adrian Smith had posted a link to an article about plans for civil partnership ceremonies in churches with his own comment: 'An equality too far'

A Christian housing manager had his salary slashed after allegedly being ‘entrapped’ by a lesbian colleague into criticising gay marriage on his private Facebook page, a court heard yesterday.

Adrian Smith, 55, had posted a link to an article about plans for civil partnership ceremonies in churches with his own comment: ‘An equality too far.’

After a lesbian colleague asked if that meant he didn’t approve, he posted that he could not understand ‘why people who have no faith and don’t believe in Christ would want to get hitched in church’.

Another colleague complained that the comment was offensive, despite having not seen the post, and Mr Smith was disciplined and had his post downgraded and his salary cut by £14,000.

Yesterday the married father-of-one launched a court battle to overturn the decision and win back lost earnings. They stand at nearly £4,000 for the past 18 months, according to his legal team.

However, his future lost earnings which he could seek to recoup should he fail to overturn his demotion are likely to be at least £60,000.

It is the latest in a series of claims by Christians that they have been discriminated against for expressing their beliefs at work.

Mr Smith, of Tottington, near Bury, who attends an evangelical church in Bolton and preaches part-time, posted a link on his Facebook page to an article about gay ‘marriage’ on the BBC website in February last year. Under the headline ‘Gay church marriages get go-ahead’, Mr Smith had posted: ‘An equality too far.’

The hearing was told that of Mr 
Smith’s 200 Facebook friends, more than 40 worked with him at the 
Trafford Housing Trust. On his profile he gave his occupation as 
housing manager at the trust, which runs Trafford council’s housing 
stock. Later that day, a lesbian colleague with whom he was friends on 
Facebook, Julia Stavordale, 56, responded: ‘Does that mean you don’t 
approve?’

Hearing: Mr Smith gave evidence today at Manchester County Court at the start of a two-day trial where he is claiming his employers acted unlawfully in demoting him

A day later, Mr Smith responded: ‘No, 
not really. I don’t understand why people who have no faith and don’t 
believe in Christ would want to get hitched in church. The Bible is 
quite specific that marriage is for men and women.

‘If the State wants to offer civil 
marriages to the same sex then that is up to the State; but the State 
shouldn’t impose its rules on places of faith and conscience.’

Later that week another colleague, 
Stephen Lynch, who was not friends with Mr Smith on Facebook, complained
about the post, despite not having seen it.

The trust’s ‘equality and diversity 
lead’, Helen Malone, referred it to ‘service leads, neighbourhoods’ 
Debbie Gorman. Mr Smith was suspended on full pay from his 
£35,000-a-year post while an investigation began. Miss Stavordale backed
the complaint, saying the trust should ‘throw the book at him’ and he 
was ‘blatantly homophobic’.

The following month, Mr Smith was 
found guilty of gross misconduct by ‘assistant director, customers’ Mike
Corfield for a breach of trust disciplinary policies. Because he gave 
his job as a housing manager on his Facebook profile, his comments could
be construed as representing trust policy.

He was told he faced dismissal, but 
because of his eight years’ ‘loyal service’ he was instead demoted to 
money support adviser on just £21,396-a-year.

Unimpressed: Julia Stavordale (pictured right, with her partner Judy Simmons) was a lesbian colleague with whom Mr Smith was friends on Facebook.

That reduction was to be phased in 
over 12 months but, although Mr Smith’s appeal was rejected, that period
was doubled to 24 months.

Adrian
Smith’s bosses said the fact that he gave his job and his employer on 
his Facebook profile meant others might see his comments as trust 
policy.

However, he also revealed his liking for Tottenham Hotspur and for wholemeal toast and apricot jam on the site.

Manager
Deborah Gorman was asked whether Mr Smith’s post ‘Well done Spurs’ 
could have been liable for disciplinary proceedings because it might 
offend Manchester United fans. 

Judge,
Mr Justice Michael Briggs, also asked if Mr Smith’s references to toast
and jam might also be taken to represent trust policy.

Yesterday Mr Smith came to court with 
his claim for breach of contract and loss of earnings up to his planned 
retirement date of 2017 – likely to be as much as £60,000.

Mrs Gorman, Mr Corfield and Mr Barrow –
each of whom swore oaths on the Bible – all stood by the decision to 
demote him at the hearing before the High Court sitting at Manchester 
Civil Justice Centre.

Hugh Tomlinson, QC, representing Mr 
Smith, said that in response to his ‘uncontroversial comment’ Mrs Gorman
launched a ‘Leveson-style inquiry’.

He suggested Miss Stavordale’s 
questioning of Mr Smith’s views on Facebook were an attempt to ‘entrap’ 
him’. He argued that Mr Smith’s comments were clearly his personal views
and he told Mrs Gorman: ‘The whole thing is a huge and extraordinary 
over-reaction.’

Last night Miss Stavordale, 56, who no
longer works for the trust and was not called to give evidence, told 
the Daily Mail that she had not tried to entrap Mrs Smith.

Mr Lynch, who is understood to live 
with a male partner, was not at home. Mr Smith is being supported by the
Christian Institute. The case is due to finish today.
