A group of holidaymakers is suing an airline after a flight from Mexico to Manchester was delayed for 19 hours.

Hundreds of passengers were left stranded in Cancun when an administrative error grounded flight TOM195.

The jet was denied permission to fly through US airspace as some of the passengers' passport details had not been entered into a database as required.

Passengers spent five hours at the airport in Cancun as a result of the gaffe before being told the flight would not depart until the following day.

They were put up in a local hotel and eventually landed at Manchester Airport some 19 hours late.

Thomson Airways initially offered £10 compensation although later increased it to £100 per passenger.

But some travellers - furious at the 'token' original offer - believe new EU rules on delayed flights entitles them to up to £500.

Among those taking action is Nick Marriott, 46, who says the delay in November ruined his family's £4,700 dream holiday.

The council worker, who travelled with his wife and two children, 20 and 18, said he had to fork out £45 for airport food as well as fund an extra stay in a kennel for his pet dog. Passengers are also claiming for lost earnings.

Mr Marriott said: ‘Thomson Airways managed the situation terribly. It was only after over five hours that they offered us bottles of water and started to suggest that the flight probably wouldn't leave that night.

‘The whole experience was a nightmare and a terrible way to end what had been a fantastic holiday in Mexico.’

A
 spokesperson for Thomson Airways said: 'We would like to apologise for 
the inconvenience caused to customers travelling from Cancun, Mexico to 
Manchester Airport on flight TOM195 in November last year, after their 
flight was delayed.'

She
 explained: 'Thomson Airways operates a fair and thorough process to 
deal with EU Delay Claims in line with the regulation. The law in this 
area is complex and some situations will not result in an entitlement to
 compensation.

Long day: Passengers were forced to wait at Cancun Airport for five hours before they were eventually told their plane would not depart until the following day

Finally home: Thomson Airways initially offered £10 compensation to delayed passengers, although later increased it to £100 per person

'The clause ‘extraordinary circumstances’ does encompass a number of eventualities, and this can include the failure of communication services operated by a third party, which in this instance resulted in the US authorities being temporarily unable to authorise these customers to fly through their airspace. This failure was beyond our control and is extremely rare.'

The airline added: 'We’d like to reassure customers that we are committed to maintaining an excellent on-time performance across our flying programme, and we work hard to maintain the title of most on-time charter airline.

'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings we are unable to comment further.'

The Marriotts, from Sheffield, and 20 other passengers who were on the delayed flight are being represented by law firm Thompson Solicitors.

Solicitor Martyn Gwyther said: ‘The way in which Thomson Airways have treated their passengers is appalling, as were their attempts to get off cheaply by flouting their responsibilities.’

But a spokesman for the airline said: ‘We would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to customers after their flight was delayed. 

‘The law is complex and some situations will not result in compensation. As this is subject to legal proceedings we are unable to comment further.’
