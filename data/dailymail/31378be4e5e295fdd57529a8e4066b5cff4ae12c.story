Major food companies are 'hoodwinking' shoppers by naming products after ingredients that aren't even in the packet, an investigation has found.

Beef and Tomato Pot Noodle, Uncle Ben’s chicken rice and Schwartz bacon-flavour bits are just some of the big brands which fake their meat content to entice consumers.

Instead, manufacturers create phoney meat flavouring using lumps of soya protein, yeast extract and powdered vegetables.

One popular product even achieves its meaty appearance by colouring their food with crushed insects.

But an investigation conducted for MailOnline
 by leading consumer activist Martin Isark found that nearly all of this
 information was buried on the back of the packet where shoppers are 
often too busy to look.

Not what it says on the tin: Some of the big brands that name their food after meat that's not even in the packet. But what do they use instead? Find out below...

With the recent horse meat scandal making many people sensitive about what's in their food, campaigners now want firms to be more honest with their packaging.

Mr Isark, founder of the Can I Eat It? barcode scanning app and website, said: 'They’re not breaking any rules – but there are calls for clearer labelling to stop shoppers from being caught out.

'The information's all there on the back of the pot, but not on the front - and that’s the part facing busy shoppers.'

His supermarket survey found all Pot Noodles including Beef and Tomato, Chinese Chow Mein and Sticky Rib could be eaten by a vegetarian as they contain soya pieces and artificial MSG flavourings.

Even Schwartz bacon-flavour bits have come nowhere near a pig. They are instead fashioned out of textured vegetable protein.

And the bacon-style colour is achieved 
by a little-known ingredient called carmine or E120, a red dye 
made from the crushed bodies of beetles which may well be an unpalatable addition for many consumers, particularly vegetarians.

Meanwhile, a pack of bacon-flavoured, rasher-shaped Frazzles could also be enjoyed by non-meat eaters because they get their taste from smoke flavouring and flavour enhancers.

Mr Isark says companies can get round the law by using the term 'flavour' on their products, but claims these are often in obscure places or hidden in the small print.

Commenting on the findings, Liz O’Neill, head of communications for The Vegetarian Society, said: 'It’s important for everybody to know what’s in their food and it’s surprising how few people really do know what they’re eating.

'Vegetarians probably know more about ingredient lists than most consumers - indeed, that’s why many of us are vegetarians.

'However, we can all be caught out by misleading terms and it’s certainly a shame if vegetarians miss out on foods that they could enjoy because manufacturers believe that there are marketing benefits in the terms like "beefy" or "chicken flavour".'

Tom Hay, vegetarian judge for Great Taste Awards, said: 'If I can eat these products, I want to know about it.

'Unfortunately, for the veggie shopper that "suitable for vegetarians" logo is often pretty well hidden.

'When products don’t contain the thing they’re supposed to taste of, food brands don’t like to shout about it.'

Shopper Stuart Rhodes, 56, from Harrogate, told MailOnline: 'I think consumers are being hoodwinked by mislabelling of products.

'It’s just chemicals that are made to taste like the real thing - but they’re allowed to get away with it as long as they use the word ‘flavour’.

'And we’re being gullible enough to believe it. Some people don’t look beyond the label.'

Here, Mr Isark gives his verdict on some of the main offenders....

Schwartz bacon flavour bits and Walkers Frazzles are just two of the so-called 'meaty' products that do not actually contain any meat

SCHWARTZ BACON FLAVOUR BITS

Main ingredients: Soyabean flour, sunflower oil, Salt, flavourings, colours (Paprika extract and carmine).

MARTIN ISARK'S VERDICT:

'They are just textured vegetable 
protein and meaty insects in the colour.

'Most shoppers have no idea when the ingredient list display colour as carmine or E120 - that it is a red dye made from the powdered bodies of 
the cochineal insects.

'Manufacturers should stop hiding unpalatable information behind 
E-numbers or secondary names that don’t mean a jot to 99.9 per cent of 
shoppers/consumers.'

'It would be more honest for food manufacturers to say: colour from 
cochineal insects – the shopper would then be left in no doubt whether 
to leave it on the shelf or put it in the trolley.'

WHAT SCHWARTZ SAYS: 'We have clearly labelled our product "Bacon FLAVOUR Bits" to avoid any ambiguity and all ingredients are listed on the back of the pack.

'Carmine is a safe, natural and well-established food colouring.'

WALKERS FRAZZLES

Main ingredients: Maize, vegetable oil , bacon flavour (lactose from milk), flavour enhancers including monosodium glutamate, yeast extract, rusk, smoke flavouring, colour (paprika extract, beetroot red)

MARTIN ISARK'S VERDICT:

'These crispy bacon Frazzles fake their bacon flavour with milk, the dreaded flavour enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG), hydrolysed Soya protein and smoke flavouring.

'They colour them with paprika extract and beetroot red. Surely, real bacon would be a healthier option!'

WHAT WALKERS SAYS: Not yet responded to request for comment.

'There is no indication on the front label that these Pot Noodle do not contain chicken or beef ,' says Mr Isark, although they do both have 'flavour' written in a smaller font on the packaging

CHICKEN & MUSHROOM AND BEEF & TOMATO POT NOODLES

Main ingredients: CHICKEN: Noodles (47%), wheat flour, vegetable oil, salt, vegetables (4.8%), mushroom (1.6%), onions, sweetcorn)

BEEF: Noodles (47%), for the sauce and vegetables: water, tomato (8%), vegetables (6.6%) (Carrot, Onion, Peas), dried glucose syrup, wheat flour, soya pieces (texturised) (2.8%)

MARTIN ISARK'S VERDICT: 'There is no indication on the front label that these Pot Noodle do not contain chicken or beef – not helpful for the time pressed–vegetarian shopper'

WHAT UNILEVER SAYS: 'Pot Noodle has been vegetarian since it launched back in 1977.

'We have made a number of improvements to Pot Noodle over the last few 
years and as a result we have considerably reduced the salt content.

'Contrary to popular belief, there are no artificial colours or 
preservatives in a Pot Noodle with all flavours being 100% suitable for 
vegetarians – something which is clearly labelled on pack.'

Uncle Ben's Chicken flavour rice... but not chicken

UNCLE BEN'S SAVOURY CHICKEN FLAVOUR RICE

Main ingredients: Long Grain Rice, sweetcorn, red peppers, carrots, sunflower oil, natural flavouring, onion powder, roasted onion paste

MARTIN ISARK'S VERDICT:

'No
 Chicken. Most shoppers would assume that this chicken-flavoured rice 
would have had least seen a chicken in some way or other!

'Should
 say on the front: Suitable for vegetarians, but it contains garlic, 
onions and yeast extract – some shoppers have an intolerance or want to 
avoid these.'

MARS (WHICH MANUFACTURES UNCLE BEN'S) SAYS: Did not respond to request for comment.

WALKERS PRAWN COCKTAIL AND DORITOS BBQ RIB CRISPS

It's certainly no surf and turf: Neither Walkers Prawn Cocktail or Doritos BBQ Rib crisps contain any meat

WALKERS PRAWN COCKTAIL CRISPS

Main ingredients: Potatoes, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil , prawn cocktail seasoning. Prawn cocktail seasoning contains: flavouring, sugar, glucose, salt, citric acid, potassium chloride, dried yeast, dried onion

MARTIN ISARK'S VERDICT: Walkers  Prawn Cocktail? So where are the prawns?  If a chef served up a prawn cocktail without the prawns they’d be complaints a plenty!

'It would be helpful for the shopper if "suitable for vegetarians" was displayed on the front label, which these fake prawn cocktail crisps are!'

WALKERS SAYS: Did not respond to request for comment.

DORITOS BBQ RIB CRISPS

Main ingredients: Corn (whole maize kernels), sunflower oil, BBQ rib flavour (onion powder, paprika extract)MARTIN ISARK'S VERDICT: 'The BBQ Rib flavour has never seen a rib. That's why it can be labelled "suitable for vegetarians" on the back label! It would be helpful for the shopper if it was displayed on the front label.'

PEPSICO (WHICH MANUFACTURES DORITOS) SAYS: Not yet responded to request for comment.
