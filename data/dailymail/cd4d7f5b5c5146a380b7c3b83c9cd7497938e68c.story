Robber: Daniel Holland had attempted the robbery weeks after being released from prison eight years into a life sentence for a spate of robberies

This is a moment a silver-haired shop assistant got the better of a burly, masked robber during a scuffle.

The brave woman, aged in her late 50s, was confronted by armed thug Daniel Holland when he burst into a Tesco Express store just as she opened the doors at 5.30am.

The diminutive assistant grabbed hold of Holland and grappled with him on the shop floor.

CCTV images of the attack show the have-a-go heroine clinging on to Holland as he pushed her inside the shop.

But the woman, who is about 5ft tall and has not been named, soon turned the tables on the robber, pinning him up against a counter until support arrived from her colleague.

The male manager of the store in West Moors near Ferndown, Dorset, grabbed the plastic pipe Holland was wielding and used it to beat him around the head.

Holland, who is 5ft 8ins tall, was wearing a black beanie hat with eye holes cut out but he was forced to remove it after the tussle to catch his breath.

In doing so he showed his face to the security cameras, helping police to identify him.

Holland left the plastic pipe and the hat at the scene and police were able to secure DNA evidence from it to help convict the robber.

Shaven-headed Holland, 58, from Ferndown, was on licence after being released from prison eight years into a life sentence for a spate of robberies.

He was jailed for four years at Bournemouth Crown Court after pleading guilty to attempted robbery and carrying a knife.DC James Lees, from Dorset Police, said: ‘The offender came into the store holding the plastic pipe.

‘He had a short tussle with a female member of staff, after which he removed his balaclava.

‘A male staff member then ran over and took the plastic pipe off him and used it to hit him in the face.

‘The offender then ran off. The whole thing only lasted a couple of minutes.

‘I commend the prompt action and bravery of the store staff that enabled a swift police response.

‘Good witness accounts aided a thorough police investigation which successfully brought the offender to justice.’

Leslie Smith, defending, said Holland had warned the authorities that he hadn’t received enough help to combat a serious gambling addiction.

Mr Smith said: ‘He managed to abstain from gambling for around only six to eight weeks [after being released], and then he gambled away his pension and all the savings in his account.’
