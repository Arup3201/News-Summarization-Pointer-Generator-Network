The National Park Service has acquired a rare Civil War-era photograph of an enslaved woman who helped save Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's home in Arlington, Virginia.

The previously unknown photograph depicts Selina Gray, the head housekeeper to Lee and his family, along with two girls.

The photograph was unveiled Thursday at the Arlington House plantation overlooking the nation's capital that was home to Lee and dozens of slaves before the Civil War.

An inscription on the back of the image reads 'Gen Lees Slaves Arlington Va.'

Park officials said this is only the second known photograph taken of slaves at Arlington.

'It's extremely rare to have an identified photo of an enslaved person,' said National Park Service spokeswoman Jenny Anzelmo-Sarles. 'Since slaves were considered property, it's very rare to have a photo where you can identify the people in the photo.'

Gray is noted in history books for helping to save Arlington House after Lee's family left and the plantation was captured by Union troops during the Civil War.

As Lee was off leading the Confederate army, Gray supposedly told Union soldiers raiding the home to keep their hands off 'Mrs. Lee's things,' KSDK reports.

Among the heirlooms she saved at the Arlington House were several items that once belonged to George Washington. 

Wife Mary Lee was related he the Washington's and inherited various heirlooms.

Arlington House was originally built as a monument to George Washington. 

Lee's wife, Mary Custis Lee, entrusted the home to Gray, and she later confronted a Union general about soldiers pilfering Washington family heirlooms from the house. She was able to have the items safeguarded.

Gray was finally granted freedom in 1862. Her family then settled on land near Arlington. 

The photograph was purchased on eBay in September for $700 after a volunteer found it online.

The seller was based in England and found the photo in a box of unwanted images.

The photograph will be unveiled to the public Saturday, and it will be used in future exhibits after Arlington House and its slave quarters are restored over the next two years

The nonprofit Save Arlington House Inc. donated funds to acquire the image.
