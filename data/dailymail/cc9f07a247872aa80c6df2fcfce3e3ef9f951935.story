Promoted peace: David Haines, 44, oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines

The British father-of-two murdered at the hands of ISIS fanatics spent his career as an aid worker helping to protect innocent civilians across the Third World.

For more than two decades, David Cawthorne Haines travelled with aid agencies through Syria, Libya, the former Yugoslavia and South Sudan.

He dedicated his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines.

The 44-year-old was described as a hero by his family, who were inspired by him to travel the world on further aid missions.

He had a teenage daughter in Scotland from a previous marriage with his first wife, and a four-year-old daughter, Athea, in Croatia from his second wife.

Mr Haines was born in Holderness in East Yorkshire and brought up in Perth by his parents Herbert, 77, and Mary, 79, who now live in Ayr.

He studied at Perth Academy before joining the military aged 17.

According to his online CV he spent 11 years in the military, holding 'various positions covering security and threat assessments in a number of different countries' between 1988 and 1999.

It did not specify with which armed forces he served, although the Islamic State video claimed he had been in the Royal Air Force. His brother Mike later confirmed this, saying he was an engineer.

Despite getting married to his first wife when he was 22 – and having his first daughter five years later – Mr Haines was determined to continue working across the world to help civilians trapped in war-torn countries.

RAF engineer: Mr Haines spent 11 years in the military, holding 'various positions covering security and threat assessments in a number of different countries' between 1988 and 1999

 his captors to contact them. His second wife, Dragana Prodanovic Haines

Between 1999 and 2004, he was at a 
German NGO helping to revive abandoned villages and to return refugees 
to their homes after the civil war in the former Yugoslavia.

The
 work led to swift promotion and he left a few years later to become an 
independent consultant, spreading his experience in dealing with 
security to various charities and organisations.

He
 worked as a consultant director for manufacturing company Astraea, 
based in Croatia, and went to Libya three years ago, working with 
Handicap International on demining programmes.

The charity said Mr Haines had worked as 'a humanitarian' since 1999, helping people in the Balkans, the Middle East and Africa.

A year later, the aid worker 
travelled to South Sudan, where he was a security manager for Nonviolent
 Peaceforce, a civilian peacekeeping group.

Mr Haines was kidnapped by 'professional' ISIS gunmen on an isolated road in northern Syria in an attack that took just seconds, according to an eyewitness.

A Syrian translator, who worked for the same charity as Mr Haines, said they were driving back to Turkey via Aleppo as part of a four-strong group when the militants struck.

Travelling in two cars, the masked gunmen ambushed their vehicle, before ordering them to 'get out' and restraining Mr Haines and their Italian colleague Federico Motka.

They then threw the pair into the boots of their cars, while one placed a gun to the translator's head and threatened him with death if he told anyone what he had seen.

Finally, they shot out the tyres of the victims' car, before driving off with Mr Haines and Mr Motka, who was released by the terror group in May.

The group, all of whom worked for the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (Acted), had been travelling back from a three-day tour of potential new locations for Syrian refugee camps in March 2013 when they were attacked.

They had been taking a shortcut down an isolated farm road near the Atmeh refugee camp and were just miles from the Turkish border, reported The Independent.

The camp houses more than 30,000 refugees and is less than a mile from the hilltop of a village.

It has become a rallying point for foreign jihadists who have targeted aid workers, journalists and members of the Syrian Free Army.

Wanting more freedom and a 
shorter-term contract, Mr Haines left to join French non-governmental 
organisation ACTED, or the Agency for Technical Cooperation and 
Development, which works to support civilians affected by wars, natural 
disasters and economic and social crises.

Mr Haines met his wife, Dragana 
Prodanovic Haines, 45, when she was working as a translator. At the 
time, Mr Haines was helping refugees return to their homes after the 
Balkans war.

The couple ran a
 supplies business from their home near Zagreb, where friends said their
 relationship was 'a true love story' and they were ecstatic when she 
became pregnant with their daughter at the age of 41.

The
 couple, who married in Croatia in 2010 in a ceremony in which Mr Haines
 wore a kilt, were due to celebrate their fourth wedding anniversary in 
November.

Earlier this month, she described how she 'cries every day' for her husband, but has yet to tell their child of his capture.

He was with ACTED in Syria – whom he had 
been working for for just ten days - when he was kidnapped with a 
colleague, Italian aid worker Federico Motka, 31, in March last year by 
IS forces near the Atmeh refugee camp, by the Turkish border. Mr Motka was released in May, after a ransom was paid. 

Mr Haines's plight came to light at the end of a video showing the beheading of US journalist Steven Sotloff earlier this month.

He was being held by a group that included at least one of the British jihadis linked to the kidnap and killing of James Foley and Steven Sotloff, who have been nicknamed 'The Beatles'.

Reports from those with connections to the militants said Mr Haines developed vomiting and diarrhoea. He was also said to have been beaten so badly that his kidnappers were forced to arrange medical treatment.
