A cosmetic surgery clinic that submitted, to several magazines, advertising photographs featuring 'problem areas' of female patients, was repeatedly told to replace the images with something more 'aesthetically palatable'.

MYA Cosmetic Surgery, whose celebrity clients include Imogen Thomas and members of the TOWIE cast, said the adverts were a response to the recently published Cosmetic Surgery Review and a move away from using celebrities.

The promotion featured photographs of body areas of 'real women' with real problems, pinching their 'muffin tops', 'jelly bellies', and 'bingo wings', illustrating the problems that MYA report are the most commonly bemoaned treatment areas for their Vaser Liposuction procedure.

MYA beauty clinic, who offer minimally-invasive liposuction, were told to replace these adverts with something more aesthetically pleasing

The ads featured a banner asking, 'Can’t shift your…?' above the small, non-offensive pictures, before going on to offer information about the new procedure.

Advertisers at several magazines rejected the images, requesting that the body area shots be replaced with the body of a slim, tanned model in a bikini.

Michael Tilley, MYA's Marketing 
Manager and the ideas man behind the campaign said the surgery were trying to adhere to the new review asking clinics to use 'real women' in promotions, instead of scantily-clad celebrities.

He said: 'We are trying to 
respond to the Sir Bruce Keogh Review by using real women with real 
problems in our promotions rather than celebrity patients.

Advertisers at several magazines rejected the images, requesting that the body area shots from the clinic favoured by Imogen Thomas be replaced with the body of a slim, tanned model in a bikini like Miranda Kerr

'But it seems 
that the publishers cannot move away from the images of Victoria's 
Secret-esque bikini models.

'What the magazines objected to was posting pictures of models with real problem areas.'

MYA have since replaced the 'before' images with simply the names of the area.

Vaster Liposuction is a minimally-invasive form of 
liposuction that claims to help patients drop two dress sizes in two 
hours under local anesthetic with sedation.
