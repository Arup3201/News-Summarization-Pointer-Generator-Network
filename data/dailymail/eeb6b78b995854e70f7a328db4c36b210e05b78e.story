A lion who was saved from living in squalid conditions in a Romanian zoo has died after being mauled by the other big cats in his pride at a tourist attraction.

Johnny Junior was put to sleep by vets at Yorkshire Wildlife Park yesterday after he was injured during a fight with other lions, including four females. Despite staff intervening in the fight, 16-year-old Johnny was too injured to survive.

He was living in Pride 2 at the park alongside lionesses Carla, Frida, Julie and Crystal.

Johnny was one of the 13 lions whose 
plight was highlighted in a campaign to rescue them from appalling 
conditions in run down Oradea Zoo in Romania.

The
 story of the lions moved thousands of people to donate over £150,000 to
 bring Johnny and 12 other lions back to the purpose built Lion Country 
at Yorkshire Wildlife Park.

The
 13 lions arrived at the Park in 2010 and were slowly rehabilitated into
 their new home under much veterinary care and careful husbandry by 
staff.

A spokesman at Yorkshire Wildlife Park said: ‘Without any prior warning, the pride which included four females, had a fight in which Johnny was injured.

‘Staff managed to separate the other lions within minutes of the fight starting and called them into the house, where the vet attended Johnny.

‘Unfortunately, his injuries were such that there was no option but for him to be put to sleep.

‘This was extremely distressing for the staff who have cared for 16 year old Johnny since he arrived in the UK in 2010 and especially as the whole episode was completely unprecedented and out of character for the pride.’

The lions regained their health and strength and enjoyed life in Lion Country, and thousands of people have been to see them.

The spokesman added: ‘Yorkshire Wildlife Pak announces with great sadness that Johnny Junior, one of the famous lions rescued from Romania, has died.

‘The directors of Yorkshire Wildlife Park would like to thank the veterinary teams from Portland House Veterinary Group from Retford who responded so quickly to this unexpected event and who have worked and supported staff to help improve the health of Johnny and the other lions since their arrival.

‘The Park would also like to thank the dedicated staff team who have loved and cared for Johnny since his arrival and who today are shocked at the sudden loss of one who was a favourite at the Park for staff and visitors alike.’

Johnny Junior is the third of the lions to die since his arrival in the UK. Johnny Senior died in June 2012 while Cezar died in January of this year.

There are ten remaining lions at the park.

The death of Johnny Junior will inevitably conjure up memories of fellow wild animal Marius, a giraffe killed, chopped up and fed to lions last month at Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark.

Despite more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save the two-year-old animal, staff went ahead and shot Marius with a bolt pistol.

The Danish zoo said the drastic move, a killing witnessed by watching schoolchildren, was needed to combat inbreeding and insisted the display was educational.

But animal rights campaigners condemned the killing of Marius, saying it exposed the cruel reality of welfare even in Europe’s top zoos.

Marius’s plight had triggered worldwide outpourings of protest, including an offer to rehome him in Britain, with many saying they were sickened by a zoo killing a healthy animal.

Despite protestations, the zoo announced Marius had been killed with a bolt gun instead of a lethal injection, which would have contaminated the flesh.

His carcass was then skinned and chopped up while visitors crowded around and the meat was fed to the lion population.

After the autopsy Marius was fed to the lions, with staff calling the procedure part of the 'circle of life'

On the same day, Longleat Safari Park admitted it put down two lions and four cubs.

The Wiltshire park said it had too many lions and they were growing violent.

But visitors asked why new homes were not found.
