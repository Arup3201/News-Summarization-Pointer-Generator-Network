The Fourth of July fatal tragedies involving children being electrocuted while swimming has claimed its fourth victim.

Nathan Lynham, who was shocked during celebrations at Cherokee lake, Tennessee, has died in hospital.

The accident occurred when he was playing with his friend, ten-year-old Noah Winstead and the two jumped into a lake off a docked houseboat.

Investigation: In a second incident, in eastern Tennessee, one 10-year-old boy died and another was critically injured after being shocked while swimming in German Creek Marina. Evidence tape covers an electrical meter located near two house boats at the marina in Bean Station

Tragedy: 13-year-old Alexandra Anderson and her 8-year-old brother, Brayden, were electrocuted while swimming near a private dock in Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks on Wednesday

Noah died at the scene and Nathan was airlifted to Children's Hospital in Knoxville, Tennesse, but died of this injuries on Thursday night.

Seven people who 
tried to help the boys - four adults and three children -  were also shocked at the 
German Creek Boat Dock in Bean Station, where two families were 
celebrating Independence Day on a houseboat, officials said.

They were taken to local hospitals for medical attention.

'People on board the houseboat heard 
some screams and found the two boys floating in the water, with their 
life jackets on, unconscious,' said Matt Cameron, a spokesman for the 
Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.

Witness  Betty Hamilton said, 'People jumped into the water. My son and 
brother helped get the one little boy out. They gave him CPR and 
everything. I was comforting the parents the best I could.'

'We
believe that somehow or another, the electricity at this point got into
the metal of the boat, and when the children touched the metal ladder 
to get in, that's when the electrocution occurred,' Grangier County 
Sheriff Scott Layel said.

Devastating: Authorities said it was uncertain whether the boys were electrocuted in the water or when they touched the metal ladder of one of the houseboats

In a separate incident Alexandra Anderson, 13, and her
eight-year-old brother Braydon were killed by an 'unknown source of 
electricity' in the Missouri lake on Wednesday.

Police say the children were swimming 
near a private dock on the Lake of the Ozarks when they were shocked by 
an 'unknown source of electricity' just after noon.

Adults standing on a dock heard 
screaming and jumped in. Police say those who jumped in felt electricity
and cut off power to the dock. The adults got the children out of the 
water and immediately began CPR, but it was too late.

Investigators were looking at electricity powering lights and a pump used to supply water to a slide on the lake.

Electrocuted: People heard screams before finding the boys, who were wearing life jackets, floating unconscious in the water between two boats

In a separate incident, three children from the same family were drowned while out fishing in Marshallstown, Iowa.

Siblings Lee Meh, nine, Sae Reh, seven and their cousin Thay Mo, also seven, were swimming in the river and never resurfaced.

Their bodies were pulled from the water some time later.
