Frankly, it sounds like the plot of a charming little TV drama. An elderly couple on the eve of their 50th wedding anniversary set off on a canal trip around Britain, meandering through the countryside and meeting all sorts of characters, some more madcap than others.

They have their own eccentricities, which makes for vivid viewing. His steering isn't perhaps what it should be so there's always the possibility of a crash (and no, viewers aren't disappointed); she's the sort of woman who hankers for a haircut in the middle of a boating holiday.

The emotional punch comes halfway in, when it emerges that the 'slight condition' that makes her a tad forgetful (not least in remembering to undo the mooring ropes) turns out to be a form of Alzheimer's.

Is it a comedy or a tragedy, though? Possibly, like all the best productions, it's a bit of both, shot through with very British humour and lashings of tea (and occasionally something stronger).

But this programme isn't fictional - which somehow makes it even more gripping. It's a Channel 4 documentary where two of our finest actors, Prunella Scales and Timothy West - who've been married for 50 years - take a trip along a series of canal networks, and down memory lane in the process.

They may be well-known for being two of our most high-profile actors (and political campaigners to boot) but away from the TV studio or stage, Pru and Tim have long been keen narrowboat fans, having owned their own boat for decades.

While they've spent the last half-century building their careers (her most famous  role is still Sybil in Fawlty Towers; he's a renowned classical actor who most recently popped up in EastEnders), every holiday was spent cruising up and down the canal network in England and Wales and their sons Samuel (now an acclaimed actor in his own right) and Joseph joined them on their jaunts (Tim also has a daughter, Juliet, from his first marriage).

'We're canal nuts,' explains a gleeful Pru at the start of this televised adventure. 'We've been pottering around on them all our married life. We've had some of our best times. Whenever we get a break we dash off to our boat.'

Indeed, these two were canal nuts many years before narrowboating was fashionable, and the home movie footage that's spliced alongside film of their current trip is glorious - showing youthful faces and almost empty stretches of canal.

In narrowboat circles, they're quite famous (and for reasons that have nothing to do with acting). They spearheaded a campaign to restore the Kennet and Avon canal some 24 years ago, and steered the first boat through once the work was complete.

Nearly a quarter of a century on, they return to this stretch of water - now a tourist magnet where the towpaths are awash with day-trippers and cyclists - to see how things have changed. At first it seems that everything has.

The boat they hire (they still have their own, but it's moored elsewhere) has a TV installed, which appals Tim, who thinks boating holidays should be all about board games and books and conversation.

The other striking difference from those bygone days, though, is how they have changed. Although they look sprightly enough clambering over locks and on and off boats, there's no getting away from the fact that Pru is 81 and Tim is 79.

During the opening sequences they muse over the fact their 50th wedding anniversary is upon them. 'Fifty years - it feels more like 14,' says Tim, while his wife explains the thinking behind their trip.

'We're determined to make the most of what we love - while we still can.'

They've always been endearing figures but the glimpse into their marriage offered here is hilarious and touching in equal measure.

On the first morning, Tim bemoans the fact that his age means regular toilet trips at night which in the darkness, on an unfamiliar boat, can be 'bad news for the floor'. He wonders if he left a puddle. She reassures him, saying, 'Very good aim, darling.'

But it's Pru's health that causes more concern. It's long been known in showbiz circles that she has problems with memory loss. Here, however, they open up about what that actually means. 'Pru has this condition - it's a sort of Alzheimer's,' says Tim. 'It's quite mild, but she can't remember things very well.'

'You don't have to remember things on the canal, You can keep your mind vacant and enjoy things as they happen and as you see them. It's perfect for Pru, really.'

Not that it's stopped her doing anything. At least not boating. Indeed, it emerges that this trip is possibly one of the few activities Pru can do that won't accentuate her problems. 'You don't have to remember things on the canal,' he explains, neatly glossing over the mooring rope incident.

'You can keep your mind vacant and enjoy things as they happen and as you see them. It's perfect for her, really.'

They aren't the sort of couple who always have to agree (the funniest moments in this film are when they bicker), but here they do. 'It can be a nuisance sometimes,' Pru says, 'but it doesn't stop me remembering how to open a locked gate or make the skipper a cup of tea.'

Pru and Tim met in repertory theatre in the early 60s, and married in 1963. They reckon that between them they've performed in pretty much every theatre the length and breadth of Britain, although a few years back they bemoaned the fact they hadn't made it to the Scilly Isles.

Theirs is one of the longest and most successful marriages in showbiz, and they still live in the same house they bought when Pru was pregnant with their first child. Everything about them screams solidity. Which makes Tim's fleeting confession - that his wife is no longer the woman he married - all the more affecting.

'When you think back over a long period,' he says at one point during the trip, 'this person I loved and enjoyed this, that and the other with doesn't really exist any more. It's another person. That's quite painful.'

Prunella is most famous for her role as Sybill in Fawlty Towers

But as soon as the admission comes, it's brushed away and replaced with the optimism and joie de vivre that seems to characterise their marriage. 'But you mustn't think like that. Let's just take it from day to day. You notice how much she's able to do and how much she enjoys life.'

Pru is quick to accentuate the positive too - usually with a dash to the kettle. 'I certainly do enjoy life and I can still perform my duties as crew,' she says, making another cup of tea and serving up the shortbread.

'Her sense of humour is still there,' confirms Tim. 'The same things make her laugh and we have a lot of fun. She's just growing old and, in a certain area, more quickly than either of us would like. But we're very lucky, really.'

This is a three-part documentary series, each part focusing on a different canal trip. Viewers get a dollop of history ('when it was built the Kennet-Avon canal was the M4 of its day') and an appreciation of geography (although it was filmed pre-floods, when the sun seemed to be permanently shining).

Pru and Tim would probably quibble with the idea that the programme is about them, given that it focuses on them meeting all manner of fellow canal lovers. Pru manages to get her haircut during the trip - courtesy of a hairdresser who runs Britain's only known floating salon.

They also pop in to meet a young couple who not only holiday on the canals but have set up a permanent home on the water.

Yet as a portrait of their marriage, and well-lived lives, it is spot on (and the fact that it's gentle and completely unshowbizzy is a bonus).

So what's the attraction, for them, of a life on water? Pru sums it up. 'People are terribly friendly on the canal. There's a nice feeling about it. I think it's something to do with life at four miles an hour. It attracts people who like that rhythm. Each canal is different but they all offer this wonderful antidote to the hustle and bustle of modern life. You can't rush on a canal.'

The enduring image of them is of him steering, while she gazes out the window, lost in her thoughts.

'Do I know where we're going or why we're going there?' she says. 'Well, sometimes I do, and sometimes I just want to watch the countryside slide by.'

Long may they sail.
