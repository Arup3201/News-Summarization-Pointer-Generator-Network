For Burnley, a famous victory. For champions Manchester City, plenty of soul-searching required. After failing to stop George Boyd, not many will fancy their chances of coping with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at the Nou Camp on Wednesday.

It was a famous night at Turf Moor, their first win over City since 1974 ranking alongside their 2009 victory against Manchester United in their first season in the Premier League when Robbie Blake scored the winner.

City deserved what they got — absolutely nothing. Their manager, Manuel Pellegrini, looked pale and drawn by the final whistle as well he might. City dominated possession but not energy, commitment or even goal chances.

They are still five points behind leaders Chelsea, having played two games more, and the immediate reaction from TV pundit Jamie Redknapp was that this was the type of performance by City players that gets managers the sack.

It was City, not the underdogs of Burnley, who used illegitimate strongarm tactics. Sergio Aguero was lucky that referee Andre Marriner did not spot his studs-up challenge that caught Michael Duff on the ankle.

Martin Demichelis crudely targeted Clarets dangerman Danny Ings and caught him in the leg, chin and back of the head on at least three occasions. The Argentine was very fortunate not to sent off on the totting-up procedure.

Everywhere you looked there was a City horror story. David Silva gave one of his worst performances in a City shirt and was hooked after missing their best chance from Aguero’s pass.

Skipper Vincent Kompany was partly culpable for Burnley’s winner after being recalled to the side. Pablo Zabaleta claimed a late penalty when he was challenged Mee. Nothing was given, correctly.

Burnley are still third from bottom but only one point behind Sunderland in the Premier League safety zone. And their winning goal after 61 minutes was excellent.

Kieran Tripper’s delivery from a free-kick was fantastic, Kompany rose to head away from goal but only to Boyd, lurking on the edge of the box.

The celebrations were akin to another famous Burnley goal, Robbie Blake's winner against Manchester United

The Scot caught his half-volley sweetly with his left foot and it arrowed past Hart into the goalkeeper’s bottom left corner. Job done and Boyd described it as ‘the most important goal of my career’.

Pellegrini was measured but his words rang hollow. ‘I don’t think we played very badly, it was a normal performance,’ he said. ‘We just needed to create more chances. Football is not about money. In the Premier League any team can beat another.’

On his side’s fading title prospects, he added: ‘We are second so we are not doing so badly. Every point we drop, it will be more difficult, but when you have mathematical chances, you have to keep fighting. We must trust what we are doing and see at the end of the season.’

Burnley boss Sean Dyche, who has seen his side earn draws at Chelsea and City this season, said: ‘We deserved to edge it. A lot has been made of this tough run of games but I said this is the challenge we want.

‘This is what the league is about and we will have a piece of it. We take challenges on. We are brave, and were again today.’

Burnley did not let City settle and the visitors took half-an-hour to test goalkeeper Tom Heaton through Edin Dzeko and Aguero. Surprisingly, the champions resorted to rough stuff as they got frustrated.

Michael Duff was caught by that studs-up challenge from Aguero that Mr Marriner missed. Demichelis clumped Ings on the back of the head when they jumped for a high ball and was booked for a late challenge on the same player a few minutes later.

Dyche looked unhappy at the time but was magnanimous after the game. ‘You should have seen me as a centre-half,’ he quipped.

City’s big chance came when Aguero played in Silva. The Spaniard should have scored but his first touch was uncharacteristically poor and his final shot was comfortably gathered by Heaton.

City paid for it when Scotland international Boyd struck after 61 minutes. The champions sent on Wilfried Bony, Stevan Jovetic and, finally, Frank Lampard to try to salvage a point. The cost of their substitutes, £50million, equals the sum Burnley have spent on transfer fees in their entire history.

The visitors did have a late penalty appeal when Ben Mee challenged Zabaleta. It was 50-50 as to whether the Burnley player took the ball or player first, and Dyche said: ‘I haven’t seen it but we’ve been on the wrong end of margins this season. If it was a penalty, maybe that’s the balance you get over the season.’

City now need a miracle in Barcelona to overturn a 2-1 first leg deficit and keep alive Pellegrini’s hopes of landing a trophy this season.

At the other end of the table, Sunderland will be nervously looking over their shoulder after this great and deserved Burnley victory.
