A Colorado man who was arrested and has been charged with kidnapping a Connecticut teenager apparently met the young girl on a Disney website.

Prosecutors say Timothy Wind, 53, met Jillian Burgos when she was 13 on a website called Disney Fairies Pixie Hollow.

The site is a forum for children to discuss their favorite fairies, like Tinkerbell, and has been shut down since September of last year.

The two were in contact for almost 2 years before Wind drove from his apartment in Longmont, Colorado to where Burgos lives in Hartford, Connecticut on August 25, taking the girl from her home.

She was last seen by her father playing in their backyard. 

Wind then drove the teen back to Colorado, taking her on a 'honeymoon-style trip' along the way according to NBC Connecticut, with stops in New York, New Jersey and Kansas.

He even showed the young girl the spot where his parents fell in love

The teen was discovered at Wind's apartment yesterday, almost 2,000 miles from her home, over two weeks after she disappeared. 

Police said the teen was in safe and good condition.

Wind, who  was arrested  by Longmont police with the help of the FBI, is being charged with second-degree kidnapping, sexual assault of a child, Internet sexual exploitation of a child and enticement of a child.

Officials are still uncertain if the young girl, who initially lied about her age and name when officials came to Wind's apartment, willingly went away him.

The two reportedly slept together on an air mattress in Wind's apartment, and while the victim has denied they had sex, documents state, 'it is highly suspected unlawful sexual contact occurred based on totality of this initial investigation.'

While searching a laptop following the disappearance, officials found pictures of male genitalia and a love poem they assume was written by the victim from July of 2013. 

Documents also reveal that one of the victim's friends said she had a boyfriend of over a year named 'Tim.'

Wind's bond has been set at $100,000, and a judge has ordered that he have no contact with children.
