A single house peeks out of a swirl of mist, soft morning sunlight bathes a hillside in pink and orange light, heavy fog turns the landscape ghostly green. 

In these ethereal images Polish photographer Marcin Sobas captures the unreal world of early morning in two of Europe's most beautiful regions.

He travelled to rural villages in Tuscany in Italy and the Beskid Mountains in Poland, venturing out before dawn while the villagers slept in tiny wooden cottages and brick villas among swirling mist.

Every single picture tells a different story where the light and conditions are the main characters such as these rolling Tuscan hills shrounded in mist

The first rays of sunlight turns the clouds pink and the land orange in Marcin Sobas's image of this village in the Beskid Mountains in Poland

He said: 'It’s a compilation of pictures which were taken in Poland and Italy during several sunrises. The main themes are the houses, huts and villages because I am fascinated by such views and landscapes.

'When I was taking these pictures I stood higher than these houses and was enjoying the sunlight. People who live in these houses slept tight in the darkness of mists.'

Sobas ,who lives in Silesia in Poland, works in IT but his real passion is landscape photography and capturing the charms of nature.

Houses, huts and villages, such as these in the Beskid Mountains, fascinate Sobas

 He started taking pictures as a child when his father, from whom he inherited his love of nature, gave him a compact camera as a present.

His favourite themes are light and weather and the way in which they interplay to make familiar landscapes seem strange and unreal. 

He said: 'Ever since I can remember I have always been sensitive for the charms of nature. I believe this is originating from my father who was also the one who gifted me a compact camera.

'This was the very moment that have initiated my adventure with photography. The next key milestone was the purchase of a professional DSLR camera, from that moment on I started to take photography for serious – and in a much more conscious way. It has become my greatest passion.

'I specialise in landscape photography. My favorite themes are rolling farmlands, foggy mornings in the mountains and by the lakes.

 'I do my best to have every single picture to tell a different story where the light and conditions are the main characters.#

'These two factors make the world look extreme and unreal at various times of a day and year. In the future I plan to check myself also in other areas like birds and wildlife photography which I find fascinating.

'I hope that at some point of time I will manage to fulfill my greatest dream which is visiting all earth’s continents.'

The Beskid Mountains, Beskidy in Polish, are a discontinuous series of forested mountain ranges lying in the eastern Czech Republic, northwestern Slovakia and southern Poland.

They are popular for their historic wooden churches and skiing resorts.

A small but growing population of bears, wolves and lynx roam the mountains.

Autumn leaves and red roofs and green grass begins to emerge from the grey shroud covering this Polish village

This Tuscan house seems suspended in heaven as the mist surrounds it completely
