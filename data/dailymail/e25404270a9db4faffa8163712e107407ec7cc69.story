The White House committed today to a 'firm' deadline of Tuesday for Iran to make a permanent pact with a group of international negotiators not to build up it nuclear capabilities. 

'We’ve been clear that the end of March is a firm deadline, and that’s simply because these negotiations have taken place over the course of more than a year,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Friday afternoon. 

'That should be ample opportunity for us to reach an agreement.'

Major powers and Iran were pushing each other for concessions ahead of an end-March deadline for a preliminary nuclear deal, with Tehran demanding an immediate end to sanctions and freedom to continue sensitive atomic research, officials said

The timetable for the details of the agreement to be set in stone continues to be the end of June. 

'But where we need to start, is the outlines of a political agreement,' he said, which 'is something we are aiming to achieve by the end of March.' 

U.S. officials and their foreign counterparts in the P5 +1 group - the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council along with Germany - were in Switzerland on Friday with Iran's negotiators making a desperate last ditch bid to secure a landmark agreement - 13 years since the country's nuclear program became public.

Britain's Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said earlier this week an agreement was 'deliverable' but urged Iran to make 'tough decisions' ahead of the meeting in Lausanne, on the shores of Lake Geneva.

Along with five world powers, Britain is seeking a deal that would allow Iran to continue its Uranium enrichment program while reducing the likelihood of it gaining nuclear weapons. 

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters staking out the talks that he didn't have a strong sense if an acceptable agreement could be made in the next several days.

'The negotiations are difficult and complicated and there
are highs and lows,' Zarif said, according to Reuters. 

'We think an agreement is still
possible but when is another story. Our feeling is that we
certainly will be able to reach an agreement, but that will need
political will on the other side.'

The White House said Friday that it continued to believe the coalition had a 50 percent chance of convincing Iran to make the required concessions by the last day of the month, Tuesday, March 31.

'It’s still at best 50-50,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday. 'That’s the odds that I have previously given to the likelihood of an agreement being reached before the deadline, and those odds have not changed.'

Still 'fluid' next week is Obama's schedule. 

The White House declined to give reporters a preview on Friday, as is generally expected, of the president's plans beyond a Monday trip to Boston, Massachusetts, leaving him open to take on a more direct role in negotiations.

The president has been receiving regular and at least 'daily' updates on the situation, his spokesman said Friday. 

After the afternoon briefing the White House sent reporters a notice that Obama had called German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the state of negotiations. 

The statement said the two world leaders agreed that 'Iran must make decisions necessary to resolve several remaining issues.'

It did not provide details on what those deal-breaking matters were.

An Iranian official told Reuters, however, that lingering issues with the coalition, which includes, China, Russia and France in addition to Germany, Britain and the U.S., were over research and development and U.N. sanctions.

Iran reportedly wants an immediate draw down of sanctions, which the U.S. and its partners have said is a deal-breaker.

The White House reiterated on Friday that only after it verified, over time, that Iran was keeping up its end of the pact would it ask Congress to ease sanctions on the country. 

Another Iranian negotiator told AFP on Friday that as far as his country is concerned, 'It all depends on the willingness of the other side. All the solutions are on the table.'

'We have already done what we need to do,' he stated.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reached out directly to the leaders of France, Russia, Britain and China on Thursday in an attempt to break the stalemate and passed on letters to all six members of the international coalition, including President Obama.  

Elsewhere, the hawkish French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has warned against a soft deal during negotiations.  

'Tough decisions': This map helps demonstrate how Iran's nuclear program is spread across the country 

Britain's Hammond warned failure to achieve a deal over Iran's nuclear program could trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. 

Iran's nuclear program became public in 2002 when an opposition group revealed secret activity including construction of an uranium enrichment plant and a heavy-water reactor. 

Enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, while spent fuel from a heavy-water reactor contains plutonium suitable for a bomb.

Following that, Iran agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But the IAEA could not confirm whether it had tried to  develop nuclear weapons.

This led the P5+1 to press Iran to stop enriching uranium. Talks failed and in 2005 the IAEA referred Iran to the UN Security Council for failing to comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

Since then, the Security Council has adopted six resolutions requiring Iran to stop enriching uranium, some imposing sanctions. In 2012, the US and EU began imposing additional sanctions on Iranian oil exports and banks, putting pressure on Iran to negotiate.

Tehran insists its program is for civil nuclear power, but the international community has imposed sanctions amid concerns Iran harbors ambitions to create nuclear weapons. 

In a speech in London, Hammond said he was clear that 'no deal is better than a bad deal' if talks in Switzerland break down this weekend.

'But we should also be clear-eyed about the alternative,' he said.

'No deal means no restrictions on enrichment, no restrictions on research and development, and no independent monitoring or verification. It means a fundamentally more unstable Middle East, with the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the region.'

He added: 'So now is the time, with our key allies, to build on the recent momentum, to press Iran where differences remain, and to strain every sinew to get a deal over the finishing line. The door to a nuclear deal is open, but Iran must now step through it.'  

Iran and the P5+1 agreed an interim accord in November 2013 that saw it cut down on sensitive nuclear activities in return for temporary relief from sanctions that have crippled its economy.

A deadline of July 2014 was set to find a 'comprehensive solution', but the talks were subsequently extended by four months to give negotiators more time.

Despite 'significant progress' being made, both sides agreed in November that another seven months were needed. 

Diplomats now hope to reach a rough deal this weekend with all-important technical details decided by June 30.
