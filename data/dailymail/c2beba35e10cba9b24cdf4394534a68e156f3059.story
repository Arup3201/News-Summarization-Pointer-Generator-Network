Convicted D.C. sniper Lee Boyd Malvo says in a newspaper interview that seeing the reaction of a victim's husband made him feel like 'scum.'

Malvo expresses remorse in an interview with The Washington Post published Sunday.

The interview is timed with Tuesday's 10th anniversary of the beginning of the deadly spree in the Washington area carried by Malvo and John Allen Muhammad.

The pair has been linked to 27 shootings across the country, including 13 attacks in the greater Washington area which left 10 dead.

Teen on trial: Lee Boyd Malvo, who was 19 in this picture at the 2003 trial, spoke in a rare public interview in the lead up to the 10th anniversary of the shootings

Malvo tells the Post that the devastated reaction from victim Linda Franklin's husband as he stood next to his wife when she was shot. The image of Ted Franklin's eyes remains seared in Malvo's memory.

Lasting impression: Malvo said that he felt like 'scum' after he shot Linda Franklin (pictured) and he saw her husband's reaction

Describing how he felt when he saw the man's face right after the shooting, Malvo says: 'You feel like the worst piece of scum on the planet.'

'Words do not possess the depth in which to fully convey that emotion and what I felt when I saw it,' he told The Washington Post.

Mrs Franklin was 47-years-old when she was killed outside a Home Depot in northern Virginia. She was the 11th shooting victim.

The sniper-style attacks all but 
paralyzed the nation's capital, as people were shot at random while 
going about their everyday life - pumping gas, buying groceries, and for
one young boy, as he went to school.

The
shooters used a high-powered rifle, firing from the trunk of a modified
Chevy Caprice until they were tracked down at a Maryland rest stop.

Malvo
is serving six consecutive life sentences with no chance of parole in 
Red Onion state prison in Virginia. Muhammed was killed via lethal 
injection in 2009 for his crimes.

The shootings were details, 
meticulously planned, and far more widespread than initially predicted 
as Muhammed and Malvo later admitted that they also had victims in 
Louisiana, California, and Texas.

'There
is no feeling. At that point in time, I had been desensitized. I’d been
killing people for months, if not a whole year, day in and day out,' 
Malvo said in the interview with The Post's Josh White.

Impressionable: Malvo said that he has spent the past 10 years distancing himself from the teachings of John Allen Muhammed and reflecting on the way he got involved in the shooting spree

Life in solitary: Malvo spoke at length with the paper, telling of his remorse a decade after the crimes

'It
got to a point where I’d get in a zone. There was nothing else but 
whoever is before me, and anything that comes between me and, as you 
would say, the target, I’m either going to destroy, or if it’s too big, 
find a way around it. Nothing is going to stop me but death to get that 
done.'

Now 27-years-old, Malvo's defiant attitude that he showed during initial interviews and the trial have all but disappeared as he reflects on his role in the events.

'I was a monster. If you look up the definition, that’s what a monster is. I was a ghoul. I was a thief. I stole people’s lives. I did someone else’s bidding just because they said so. . . . There is no rhyme or reason or sense.'

When asked by the Post what he would say to victims' families, the remorseful Malvo said there's no way to properly convey an apology.

Punishments: Muhammed (left) was put to death via lethal injection in 2009 and, because the jury felt that Malvo (right) was brainwashed, he was sentenced to six consecutive life sentences

'We can never change what happened,' Malvo said.

'There's nothing that I can say except don't allow me and my actions to continue to victimize you for the rest of your life.'

He added: 'Don't allow myself or Muhammad to continue to make you a victim for the rest of your life. It isn't worth it.'
