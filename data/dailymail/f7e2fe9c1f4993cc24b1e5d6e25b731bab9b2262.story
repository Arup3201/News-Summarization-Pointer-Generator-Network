Lord Saatchi and his late wife Josephine Hart, who died after a long struggle with ovarian cancer

A controversial new law allowing doctors to use experimental drugs on dying cancer sufferers is set to clear a major Parliamentary hurdle today.

Conservative peer Lord Saatchi has reached a deal with opponents of his bill, which gives doctors the right to try innovative new medicines to stop patients suffering years of ‘brutal’ chemotherapy.

It means the proposal is likely to be backed by the House of Lords today, paving the way for a Commons vote before the election in May.

Lord Saatchi, the advertising mogul, could save people suffering the ‘horror and indignities of brutal chemotherapy and radiation treatment’.

The peer is pushing for changes in the law following the death of his wife Josephine Hart from ovarian cancer in 2011.

The Bill has been held up for months amid widespread concerns in the medical profession that it does not provide enough protections for patients.

It will now go to the Commons as long as there is no last-minute opposition. It is thought that a vote could take place before the general election.

Lord Saatchi said: ‘Those condemned to death by cancer suffer a worse fate than the worst mass murderer.

‘While they await death, they suffer the horror and indignities of brutal chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

‘The drugs, the cycles of their administration, and the surgical procedures are often decades old. They create the same symptoms as the disease – nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting and fatigue.’

He said allowing doctors to use untested new drugs could save lives rather than simply delay death.

Opponents of the bill – including the Labour peer and scientist Lord Winston – said the bill did not provide enough protection for patients.

But after talks with Lord Winston a new protection – meaning doctors will need seek the approval of at least one other medical professional before trying an innovative drug.

Lord Saatchi said peers ‘on all sides of the House’ are now expected to support his bill.

He told the Telegraph: ‘By the end of today the Medical Innovation Bill will have been forensically examined, tested and improved by my fellow peers on four separate occasions.

‘Those peers number among them some of the greatest legal and medical minds in this country, as well as representatives of patient groups and medical charities.’

Professor Lord Robert Winston, a Labour peer, is concerned that the new law does not offer enough protection for patients

Lord Saatchi added: ‘What the Bill will do is offer the same protection to a doctor who offers an innovative treatment to the dying patient – in advance of the treatment taking place, as long as they can get the support of at least one other relevantly qualified doctor.

‘It will encourage them to think beyond the standard treatment. It will allow them to see what else might – only might, for there are no guarantees – make a difference to the dying patient.

‘It will change the culture of defensive medicine to one where the balance of risk is gently recalibrated making it permissible to consider trying something new, something less well documented than the well-worn path to death.’
