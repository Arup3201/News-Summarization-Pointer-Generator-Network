World No 1 Novak Djokovic destroyed Tomas Berdych in a lop-sided contest to win his fifth China Open crown on Sunday.

Top seed Djokovic took 67 minutes to seal a 6-0, 6-2 win against Berdych, who raised his arms in celebration when he won a game to avoid the ignominy of a double bagel with the Serb serving for the match at 5-0 in the second set.

Berdych managed to win back-to-back games, but it was just a matter of time before Djokovic sealed an easy win to continue his love affair with the Beijing tournament where he now has a 24-0 record.

‘This was probably the best performance in a final I ever had,’ a beaming Djokovic said after the masterclass. ‘Everything I tried worked, it was incredible.’

‘Beijing is definitely my lucky place, I enjoy being here,’ he said before throwing his wristbands and towel to an ecstatic crowd.

‘Since my first China win in 2009 I have not lost a match on this court. It keeps on going,’ said Djokovic who belted 19 winners, compared to his opponent’s nine.

Berdych conceded he had not experienced such a mauling before.

‘I met somebody in the final who I’ve never seen before,’ said Berdych. ‘The way that he performed today was really outstanding. There is really not much I can add to that because, really, I was just swept off the court.

‘I just said to my coach now that I probably played over 700 matches in my career, and I met guys like Andre (Agassi), Roger (Federer), all those probably in their best times. But I have never, ever experienced anything like that.’
