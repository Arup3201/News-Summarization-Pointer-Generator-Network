Hidden behind locked gates and reserved solely for the enjoyment of a select few, it is an exclusive part of New York rarely seen by the outside world.

Gramercy Park, in Manhattan, has been off limits ever since it opened in 1831 with only the wealthy residents who live in surrounding apartments granted keys to its wrought-iron gates.

But thanks to a computer programmer and his trusty smartphone, anyone can take a tour of the tranquil two-acre park - after he posted his pictures of it online.

Thanks to a computer programmer and his trusty smartphone, the tranquil two-acre site (pictured) has suddenly become a lot more accessible

Requests for filming and photography in the park are routinely turned down, while just 383 keys exist for the wrought-iron gates

Requests for filming and photography in the park are routinely turned down, while just 383 specially-made keys exist for the gates – owned by those living in the 39 buildings bordering the patch of land.

But Shawn Christopher, a former Army sergeant from the Pittsburgh area, gained access when he rented an apartment through Airbnb during a honeymoon visit to Manhattan.

The room included access to one of the coveted keys – but he was not aware he was supposed to be accompanied by a key holder when visiting the park, or that commercial photography was banned.

Instead, he took a series of 360-degree shots using the Google app Photo Sphere before uploading them to the company’s maps site. Now anyone can enjoy a look around the park from the comfort of their home.

The organisation that runs the park receives three requests a day from people wanting to take pictures inside the gates - but each request is turned down

The New York Times reports him as saying: ‘When I found out where I was, I thought, “This has to be captured”. 

‘The Internet is all about sharing knowledge, especially these secret, hidden things.

‘I just really wanted to share this with other people. It’s such a beautiful part of New York, and people shouldn’t miss out on that.’ 

 Oscar Wilde, the Steinways and Thomas Edison all once had keys to the park while former presidents Teddy Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy played there as children

Celebrities including Uma Thurman and Rufus Wainwright are among those said to have access to the gardens, which are off-limits to outsiders

The newspaper says Oscar Wilde, the Steinways and Thomas Edison all once had keys to the park while former presidents Teddy Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy played there as children. Celebrities including Uma Thurman and Rufus Wainwright are among those said to have access to the gardens. 

The report says that Arlene Harrison, president of the Gramercy Park Block Association, receives up to three requests a day from people wanting to take pictures inside the gates – but that she always answers ‘no’.

But she said she had no intention of asking Google to remove Mr Christopher’s images.
