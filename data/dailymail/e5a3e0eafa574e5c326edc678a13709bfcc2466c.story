An Alabama mom is furious that her five-year-old daughter was forced to sign a contract saying she will not hurt herself or anyone at school after she pointed a crayon at a classmate.

The incident occurred at E.R. Dickson Elementary School in Mobile.

The mom, only identified as Rebecca, said the school asked her toddler, Elizabeth, whether she was depressed, which the little girl did not understand.

'They told me she drew something that resembled a gun,' Rebecca told WPMI-TV.

'According to them she pointed a crayon at another student and said, ''pew pew''.'

Inappropriate: A five-year-old Alabama girl was made to sign this contract after pretending a crayon was a gun

Depressed: The school, E.R. Dickson Elementary in Mobile, tried to assess whether the little girl was suicidal or homicidal 

Angry: The girl's mother is furious that the school made her daughter sign the form without consent

Confused: Rebecca (right) said her daughter Elizabeth (left) has now been asking what suicide is

The angry mother said the school then had her daughter sign a Mobile County Public Safety Contract without her consent.

'While I was in the lobby waiting they had my 5-year-old sign a contract about suicide and homicide,' Rebecca said.

'(They) asked her if she was depressed now.

'Most of these words on here, she's never heard in her life.

'This isn't right. She's 5-years-old.'

State law in Alabama outlines that minors cannot sign a contract.

The school also reccomended Elizabeth see a psychiatrist.

Rebecca is now fighting to have the incident removed from her child's record, but is also dealing with the aftermath at home.

'My child interrupted us and said, ''What is suicide mommy? Daddy what is suicide?'' Rebecca told WPMI-TV.

'As a parent that's not right.

'I'm the one should be able to talk to my child and not have someone else mention words like this in front of her at all.'
