North Koreans were treated to a exhibition of pro wrestling during a special two-day festival organised by a Japanese member of parliament. 

The bizarre event is part of a warming of relations between Japan and the hermit state run by Kim Jong Un.  

Some 15,000 residents packed the stadium to watch the show which featured to American wrestlers, one of whom was previously a pro American Footballer with the Minnesota VIkings and Chicago Bears.

Some 15,000 North Koreans packed the arena for the biggest international sporting event of the summer

The event was the first pro wrestling show in North Korea for 20 years. It was the first major sporting event with foreign 'stars' since Dennis Rodman and a group of former NBA basketball players staged a game in January for Kim Jong Un's birthday. 

The trip was organised by former Japense wrestler Kanji 'Antonio' Inoki, who is also a member of parliament. He claimed the event will help promote further exchanges with North Korea. 

However, Jang Ung, member of the International Olympic Committee and the North Korean organiser for the event used his opening remarks to attack the United States and South Korea. 

Jang claimed that President Obama was using military exercises in South Korea as a prelude to a nuclear attack on North Korea. The United States rejected that interpretation, claiming the exercises were purely defensive. 

When Americans Bob 'The Beast' Sapp and Jon Andersen took to the ring, the crowd of about 15,000 didn't seem to know how to respond.

'It was real eerie and a little scary at first,' said Sapp, who briefly played for the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears before becoming a celebrity in Japan as a mixed martial artist. 'But we were able to take control of the audience. It went over very well.'

Unusually, taking photographs of the the subject's back seems to be the preferred option in Pyongyang 

Feeling Blue: Unfortunately for the 15,000 fans who witnessed the exhibition, there was no sign of Kim Jong Un
