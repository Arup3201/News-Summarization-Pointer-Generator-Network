The world's biggest fan of comedy duo The Chuckle Brothers has spent more than £25,000 collecting rare memorabilia associated with the pair. 

Shaun Hope, 43, has spent the past 15 years collecting more than 500 autographs, posters, leaflets and rare merchandise featuring Barry and Paul Elliott. 

Mr Hope, from Willington, Co Durham, began his Chuckle Brothers obsession after seeing them play live at the Darlington Civic Theatre in 2001.

Such is his devotion to the Chuckle Brothers, Mr Hope has turned his spare room into a shrine to the duo

Such is the extent of his devotion to the brothers, Paul, 67, and Barry, 69, he has converted the spare room of his house in Willington, Co Durham as a shrine to display his unique collection. 

The Chuckle Brothers were major figures in children's entertainment during the 1990s with their own hit-rated television show.  

Mr Hope said: 'I first started collecting after I got up on stage with them. I took my family to see a show and they got me up to take part.

'I was dressed up as the daddy bear, from Goldilocks and the three bears. Since then I've met them a few hundred times.

'After the show, we got a few bits and pieces, a shirt and a cap and things, and it has just gone from there really. I've got stuff they've never even seen.'

Since his first meeting with the Rotherham-born brothers, stars of the hit 90s TV show 'Chucklevision,' Shaun has dedicated his time to run a string of fans sites.

He runs the official Chuckle Brothers Facebook page and is even in charge of a petition to get them back on TV.

He said: 'So far, we've got over 6,000 signatures in a couple of months.'

Mr Hope has also passed his obsession on to sons Ben, 19, and Jack, 13.

Mr Hope has even managed to track down incredibly rare memorabilia featuring the comedy legends

He added: 'My two sons are big fans as well. Ben is in the army now and when the lads all found out about it, he was quite popular.'

Among the items Mr Hope has collected are videos, DVDs and even part of the Chuckle Mobile, but he thinks his most valuable piece of memorabilia is a signed copy of the video Chuckle Brothers: Live and In Trouble.

He said: 'The video was never properly released. It was supposed to be but there was some trouble with the producers and they stopped it. Only four copies were let out in the end.

'I bought it for £50 and when I took it to them they signed it and promised that would be the only one they would ever sign.'

Over the years, the super-fan has become good friends with Paul, 67, and Barry, 69, whom he describes as 'the world's funniest performers.'

Barry said: 'When Shaun comes to see us we always invite him backstage and he has a cup of tea with us. He is more like a mate.'
