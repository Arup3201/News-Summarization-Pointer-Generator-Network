Prime Minister Tony Abbott has backed down on a major element of his government's proposed pay deal for Australian Defence Force personnel, in a win for renegade independent senator Jacqui Lambie. 

On Monday morning, Mr Abbott said the government would not continue with its plans to cut the discretionary leave, food and motor vehicle allowances for the nation's 57,00 servicemen and women.

But it's not a total victory for the Tasmanian senator, who was photographed discussing the matter over a drink with her estranged former party boss Clive Palmer.

It's a been a long time: Senator Lambie, right, refused to speak to her one-time party leader Clive Palmer for weeks. But on Sunday night, the two shared a drink at Canberra's Hotel Hotel, taking to tall tools to discuss a pay deal for Australian Defence Force personnel 

Once were friends: Senator Lambie and Mr Palmer worked closely together for around a year before their relationship took an acrimonious turn. Ms Lambie was elected to the Senate last year following support from Mr Palmer's party

Mr Abbott said he will press ahead with his plan to offer ADF personnel a below inflation 1.5 per cent pay increase - a pay cut in real terms.

'I want to acknowledge we are listening to the defence community on this subject,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Canberra. 

Last night, onlookers snapped Ms Lambie and Mr Palmer sipping beverages at the city's swanky Hotel Hotel. 

Senator Lambie confirmed the rendezvous this morning, telling reporters the ADF matter was a major discussion point.

'I did have a meeting with the devil himself,' the Tasmanian former army veteran told reporters, before adding, 'but I did not sell my soul.' 

Earlier on Sunday evening, Ms Lambie said in a statement that she would not accept a partial measure on the ADF deal. 

'It’s all or nothing on the ADF pay deal,' she said. 'I’m not going to take any prisoners. It’s time to empty the magazine, fix bayonets and charge.  

Change of clothes: Ms Lambie is rarely pictured wearing her distinctive Palmer United Party shade of yellow any more

'Our Diggers have done a magnificent job for Australia and deserve a fair wage rise, which keeps track with inflation and returns all their holidays and allowances.' 

Ms Lambie was hoping to meet with Mr Abbott on the matter on Monday morning but it was postponed. 

Her unusual discussion with Mr Palmer, however, raised some eyebrows, coming at a time of tension between the former colleagues. 

Just weeks ago, the mining magnate issued a statement headlined 'Jacqui Lambie is a liar' and claimed she had been plotting to set up an alternate political party.

Palmer dumped Ms Lambie as the party's deputy Senate leader after she stopped talking to him and attending meetings last month. 

She quit the party in late November.
