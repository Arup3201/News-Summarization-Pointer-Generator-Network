The Conservatives will today pledge to end six-figure pay-offs in the public sector if they win the general election.

Tory sources said the party’s manifesto will promise the swift introduction of a new ‘public sector redundancy pay cap’ to end the culture of obscene ‘golden goodbyes’ to fat cats employed by the State.

In future, pay-offs will be limited to a maximum of £95,000 in all but exceptional cases.

The BBC's former deputy boss, Mark Byford (left), received £949,000 in 2011. Katherine Kerswell (right) received a £420,000 payment in 2012 after just 20 months in charge of Kent County Council 

Senior managers will also have to hand back a portion of their pay-off if they take another job in the public sector within 12 months.

The new law will cover the entire public sector, including the civil service, the NHS, local government and the BBC – where some pay-offs have approached £1million.

The move will enrage civil service unions, particularly as Tory sources said the cap will be applied to people in existing jobs, not just those signing new contracts.

It follows public outrage over a string of gigantic payments to senior officials, many of whom went on to take other jobs elsewhere in the public sector shortly afterwards – a phenomenon known as the ‘revolving door’.

Former BBC director-general George Entwistle received a £450,000 pay-off in 2012 after just 54 days in the job. The Corporation’s former deputy director-general, Mark Byford, received £949,000 in 2011.

Other big winners included NHS managers Chris Reed and Karen Straughair, who received pay-offs totalling almost £1million in 2013.

The married couple went on to earn £120,000 for four months’ hospital work shortly afterwards.

Council chiefs have also cashed in under the existing system. Katherine Kerswell received a £420,000 payment in 2012 after just 20 months in charge of Kent County Council. The following year, she was handed a £140,000-a-year job by the Cabinet Office.

Michael Lockwood was given a £168,000 pay-off when his role as chief executive of Harrow Council was axed in February last year, only to be re-hired in November. 

Treasury Minister Priti Patel said last night that the time had come to end the culture of huge public sector pay-offs.

She said: ‘It’s not right that hard-working taxpayers, many on low salaries, have to fund huge payouts when well-paid people get made redundant.

‘So we’re going to do something that’s long overdue and that will bring some fairness back to the system.’

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will warmly welcome this announcement.

‘Over the last few years, these six-figure golden goodbyes have cost hard-pressed taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.’

The move has the potential to slash the cost of future public sector reorganisations.

Tory sources say the cap would have saved £125million in 2011/12 alone.

Only workers earning less than £27,000 will be exempt from the cap, in order to protect a small number of long-serving public sector employees on modest incomes.

The plans will also extend the ability of public sector organisations to claw back payments from people who immediately take a job elsewhere.

The Government has already changed the law to require some money to be repaid if a public servant receiving a pay-off of more than £100,000 takes a job in the same sector within 12 months.

But the Tories now plan to remove the £100,000 threshold so this applies to all pay-offs.
