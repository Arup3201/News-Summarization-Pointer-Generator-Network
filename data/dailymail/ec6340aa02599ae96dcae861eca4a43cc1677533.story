The coalition government has made decisions that are not in the national interest, David Cameron has admitted.

The Prime Minister said the Liberal Democrats have forced him into adopting policies that will damage Britain 'in the long term'.

But Deputy PM Nick Clegg hit back, insisting blocking some Tory policies was the 'right' thing to do.

Tour: David Cameron, who met staff at Air Radio in Kolkata, India, revealed the downside of sharing power with the Lib Dems

Mr Cameron and Tory MP Priti Patel walked through Kolkata, India, where they visited the Howrah Bridge which was built by the Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company

Mr Cameron made the explosive claim 
about his misgivings on life in coalition at a leadership conference in 
the Indian capital Delhi.

He
 has previously conceded that he has had to make compromises as a result
 of the coalition. But the suggestion they could erode the national 
interest is a distinct toughening of his rhetoric.

He
 told the audience of politicians and businessmen: 'I would prefer not 
to have a Coalition. We were confronted with a hung parliament after the
 election with a country in economic crisis. The most important thing to
 do was to get on and form a government…and make it work.

'We’ve
 shown it can work. And actually the good parts of Coalition are because
 you have these arguments within government and you have to proceed on a
 rational basis – that’s good.

Mr Cameron went on: 'I think what’s bad about it is that 
sometimes you have to make compromises that are not necessarily in the 
long-term interests of the country.'

He added: 'I think the clarity you get from single-party government.'

Mr Cameron did not specify precisely which Lib Dem policies he was referring to as damaging to Britain.

But senior Tories have been angered that Nick Clegg has blocked efforts to reform human rights laws, go further with welfare cuts and blocked the introduction of IT counter terror measures, dubbed the Snooper's Charter by critics.

A Tory source said: 'It's no secret there have been a few areas where we would like to have done more.'

Defiant: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was 'right' that his Lib Dems moved to block some Tory policies

Challenged about the remarks today, Mr Clegg was defiant about his role in forcing Conservative policies to be shelved.

'Of course there are compromises that the Conservatives have made that they don’t like,' he said on his weekly LBC 97,3 radio phone-in.

'They wanted to say employers could fire any employee at will, the Liberal Democrats said no you can’t do that.

'They floated a plan of having profit making in state schools and we said no. I so happen to think those are things we blocked because it was in the national interest to do so.

'Of course I understand he’s the leader of the Conservative party. He doesn’t like having to make those compromises.

'I so happen to think that with the Liberal Democrats in coalition government, we have not only proved that coalition government works but that it is still anchored in the centre ground.'

He defended his role in blocking the Snooper's Charter, which would have given the police and intelligence agencies greater access to communications data.

Mr Clegg added: 'I thought it was right for me to say I’m sorry I don’t think its in the national interest to have the Snooper's Charter going ahead, whatever you Conservatives think.

'And I have had to make compromises. I have wanted to go further on all sorts of things that I haven’t been able to, but I think on the whole comprise in politics just as it is in life, as long as you do it in a grown up way, actually works for all sides.'

Plea: Mr Cameron, pictured with Tory MP Priti Patel in front of the Shah Sayyid Tomb in the Lodi Gardens in Delhi, urged voters to return a single party government at the next election to prevent a repeat of coalition compromises

Mr Cameron is on a trade visit to India before attending a meeting of Commonwelath leaders in Sri Lanka.

The Prime Minister insisted the British public shared his desire for single party government.

'I prefer a more decisive form of government,' he said.

'I think what the British people want is a government with a very clear plan that acts on that plan.

'If the plan works then keep them in; if the plan doesn't work then kick them out.'

His words will be greeted with relief by Tory backbenchers who are concerned that Mr Cameron is plotting to form another coalition.

The Tory leader is already looking at plans to change Conservative Party rules so that all his MPs would get the chance to vote on a future coalition agreement in order to 'dip their hands in blood' and stop them complaining if there is another power-sharing deal.
