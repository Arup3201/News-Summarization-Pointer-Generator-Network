A pensioner who crashed his paraglider into a 120ft cliff miraculously escaped plunging to his death when when quick-thinking passersby raced to his aid - and sat on his chute to stop him falling.

A sudden drop in wind caused his canopy to lose height sending the man, from Taunton, Somerset, hurtling towards sheer cliff.

The thrill-seeker, 77, was left dangling helplessly 100ft above a beach after hitting the rock face.

Rescue: The 77-year-old had a miraculously escaped falling to his death after losing control of his paraglider when passersby sat on his chute

Miraculous: Quick-thinking passersby dashed over to the stricken paraglider's chute and sat on it before the pensioner could continue falling down the 120ft cliff at Eype, near West Bay, Dorset

Several heroic members of the public saw the emergency unfold and rushed to the edge as the yellow and white canopy draped over the top of the grassy cliff.

They sat on the chute to stop the pensioner, who was tethered to it by a rope, desperately clung on  to the rocks for 30 minutes until he was plucked off the cliff face by a coastguard helicopter.

The man, who has not been named, was then flown to hospital with a dislocated right hip.

The dramatic incident happened as the paragliding pensioner, who was part of a larger group, was flying above the cliffs at Eype, near West Bay, Dorset, at 6pm last night.

It was too dangerous for the members of the public, firefighters and coastguard officers to pull him up so the Portland coastguard helicopter was scrambled.

Saved: The elderly thrill-seeker was left dangling helplessly 90ft above a beach for 30 minutes while an army rescuers worked out how to reach him

After he was rescued the man was 
lowered on to the cliff top so he could be treated by paramedics before 
he was airlifted to the Dorset County Hospital at Dorchester.

Heroics: The paraglider was finally winched from the cliff by a coastguard helicopter and flown to hospital where he was diagnosed with a dislocated hip

Martin
Cox, 58, who owns the nearby Highlands End Holiday, said: ‘I arrived on
the scene and looked over the edge of the cliff and saw a chap attached
to a paraglider canopy that had got into difficulty.

‘He was just hanging from the cliff and people were sitting on his parachute to stop him slipping down.

‘The
fire service put a line down to try and reach him and then the 
helicopter winched him up to the flat on the top of the cliff where they
dealt with his injuries.

‘It was the first time I have ever seen something happen like this, despite an awful lot of paragliders using these cliffs.

‘I rather admire him for doing it at the age of 77.’

It is thought the victim is a member of the Devon and Somerset Condors hang-gliding and paragliding club.

A
spokesman for Portland Coastguard said: ‘The victim has all the normal 
kit with him and seemed to be an experienced and proficient paraglider.

‘But what seems to have happened is that there was a loss of lift in the wind and that caused him to drop.

‘After he dropped he crashed into the cliff but luckily his equipment got caught on the cliff.

‘He
was in a very precarious position and the cliff rescue team thought it 
best for the helicopter to winch him off the cliff face.

‘He suffered a suspected dislocated hip. After he was stabilised at the scene he was

airlifted to hospital.

‘He was very lucky considering the position he found himself in.’
