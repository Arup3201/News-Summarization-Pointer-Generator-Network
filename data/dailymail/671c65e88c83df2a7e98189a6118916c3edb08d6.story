On trial: Karen Carberry, 45, falsely claimed to be a qualified accountant to get a job with the recruitment giant Reed in 2001 and siphoned off £300,000, the Old Bailey was told

A finance director accused of stealing more than £300,000 to fund her 'love of shopping' told police she did it for her disabled daughter, a court heard.

Karen Carberry, 45, falsely claimed to be a qualified accountant to get a job with the recruitment giant Reed in 2001, the Old Bailey was told.

She began siphoning cash out of company accounts in 2009 and spent huge sums on shoes, holidays and a hot tub as well as gifts for her family, the jury heard.

When questioned about the missing money by her employers, Carberry supplied them with a bogus certificate from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), it is claimed.

Carberry was later arrested and made no comment other than to tell an officer: 'I knew this was going to happen. I'm so sorry. I did this for Charlotte [her daughter]. My husband is going to kill me.'

She told jurors at the Old Bailey that this comment referred to her fear she was going to lose her job.

Carberry explained: 'I hadn't done anything wrong. I was sorry to my family, how I was going to go home and tell my husband I wasn't going to have a job.

I worked as many hours as I could so that I could take time off to be with my daughter and go with her to hospital. I worked really hard for my daughter.'

Carberry insisted was an ACCA qualified accountant and passed the exam in 1996 after doing a distance learning course.

She claimed that the original certificate was framed and put on the wall at her parent's home and was lost when they moved house.

The copy supplied to Reed in 2012 was a copy supplied by the ACCA, she said.

'I paid a fee of £20 to get a copy,' she added.

Case: The Old BAiley heard that she transferred a total of £303,317.60 into her personal bank accounts

Carberry denied exploiting problems in the Reed accounting system to cover up her thefts and rejected claims she could 'blag' her way through audits by Deloitte.

She claimed that her claims for furnishings, flights, accommodation, fixtures and stationery were all related to work and that she received a bonus of £10,000 for setting up a reward scheme.

Her £1,000 long-service award was used to buy a hot tub for her family home, the court heard.

Carberry said: 'It has to be over £1,000 and we wanted a hot tub so we bought a hot tub.'

Prosecutor James Norman told jurors that Carberry stole money to fund her extravagant lifestyle and added: 'She would often have items delivered to the office and would joke about her love of shopping.'

Defending her shopping habits, Carberry insisted she made most of her purchases online.

'They were personal goods, handbags and shoes, children's clothes.

'We have a disabled daughter that does gymnastics and a son that plays football.

'I don't go out, I enjoy buying shoes.'

It is claimed she transferred a total of £303,317.60 into her personal bank accounts between 2009 and 2012 to lavish her family with gifts and pay off her credit card bills.

Carberry, of Epsom, Surrey, denies obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception between July 1, 2001 and July 31, 2001, fraud by abuse of position between 6 August 2009 and 9 July 2012 and two counts of using a false instrument between 13 August and 29 August 2012.

The trial continues.
