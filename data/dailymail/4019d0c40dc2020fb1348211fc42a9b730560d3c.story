Didn't vote in the last midterm elections? It turns out many of the celebrities pressuring young people to vote in tomorrow's off-year elections didn't cast a ballot last time, either.

According to the Washington Post at least five stars who participated in a recent Rock the Vote video urging youth to exercise their franchise didn't bother to show up to the polls themselves in 2010.

View co-host Whoopi Goldberg, Orange is the New Black's Natasha Lyonne, Glee's Darren Criss, Girls creator Lena Dunham and Rich Kids of Beverly Hills star E.J. Johnson did not vote in the last midterm election, the Post discovered. 

Lena Dunham and other celebrities in Rock the Votes Turn Out for What midterm election PSA didn't vote four years ago, their voting histories show

Records show that Glee's Darren Criss, Rich Kids of Beverly Hills star E.J. Johnson and Orange is the New Black's Natasha Lyonne didn't vote in the last midterm election

Dunham admittedly voted for her 'first time' in 2012 when she cast her ballot for President Barack Obama. 

However, the Post said it couldn't find evidence in the New York and Los Angeles voting records that her cohorts in the PSA visited the ballot box four years ago, either.

Others celebs who made cameos in the Rock the Vote campaign may not have voted, the Post said, noting that it was unable to find information for musician Lil Jon and six others who appeared in the election-themed video.

Asked about the apparent hypocrisy displayed by the celebrities who were determined not to have took part in the last midterm election, a spokeswoman for non-profit Rock the Vote said the stars had committed to voting this time around, and that's all that matters.

'Rock The Vote's approach is forward-looking,' Audrey Gelman told The Washington Post in an email. 

'The talent who participate in our campaigns are registered to vote and have pledged to turn out this Tuesday and in upcoming elections,' she added. 

'We believe individuals who have missed opportunities to vote in the past should not be disqualified from committing to participate in the political process in the future, and helping spread a positive message of civic engagement.'

Whoopi Goldberg, cast in the parody video as Lil Jon's aunt, didn't cast a ballot in 2010, either

The non-partisan get out the vote organization released a star-studded video spoofing Lil Jon's summer hit Turn Down for What last month as part of its campaign to get young people to the polls on Election Day.

Rock the Vote is a nonprofit get out the vote organization that targets young people. 

Though the organization itself claims to be non-partisan, its PSAs often feature openly Democratic celebrities.

Lena Dunham, for instance, appeared in an ad for Barack Obama's reelection campaign in 2012.

Darren Criss, who appears in the Turn Out for What video as well as a 2012 spot about the history of voting, headlined a fundraiser for Obama's reelection campaign. He also performed at Obama's second inauguration.

Furthermore, the stars in the Lil Jon jam say they are voting in favor of traditionally liberal policy positions, including 'global warming awareness' and 'reproductive rights.' 

In the parody, Lil Jon goes to his area polling place to cast his vote. He bumps Dunham and celebrity trainer Tracy Andersen while there. 

During a dance interlude later in the video Dunham drops her pants and hops around in her underwear as other popular celebs stop by to explain why they plan to vote on Election Day. 

Prison-drama star Lyonne claims to be supporting criminal justice reform. Lil Jon notes that he's voting in favor of marijuana legalization.

'Hi, I'm Fred, and I'm turning out because I want to impress my friends,' 47-year-old Saturday Night Live alum Fred Armisen states, facetiously. 'That's the only reason to ever do anything.'

A Harvard University Institute of Politics survey of young people released last week notes that only a quarter of 18-29 year olds voted in the last midterm elections and the same percentage plan to vote now. 

By a 51-47 percent margin the poll found young people prefer Republicans to win control of Congress - a stark contrast from just two years ago, when young people supported President Barack Obama en masse, and four years ago when they gave Democrats a 16-point bounce.
