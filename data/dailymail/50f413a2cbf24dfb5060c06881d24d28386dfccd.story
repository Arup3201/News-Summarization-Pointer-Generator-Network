Adam Gemili said Britain’s new generation of sprint stars are gunning for the Jamaican and American teams who dominate on the world stage after winning three of the four sprint relay titles in Zurich and adding bronze in the women’s 4x400m.

The women’s 4x100m team set a new national record of 42.24sec in the last race of these championships and the men’s 4x100m quartet — who earlier won their title in 37.93sec — dashed to embrace them.

Gemili, 20, said: ‘It is fantastic to be part of this team and hopefully we can use this relay victory as a platform to compete with the Americans and the Jamaicans.’

Harry Aikines-Aryeety, a 100m bronze medallist earlier in the week who ran a storming second leg yesterday, added: ‘This is a new generation of sprinters you are seeing. It is about enjoying ourselves now, then moving forward knowing what we are capable of.’

For the first time in the history of these championships, Great Britain posted a clean sweep of all three men’s sprint titles — 100m, 200m and 400m — thanks to the trio of James Dasaolu, Gemili and Martyn Rooney. That form translated into the relays.

Gemili anchored the 4x100m team, dipping on the line and only two-tenths off the British record. He had received the baton level with the German Lucas Jakubcyzk but accelerated away. Getting the baton round safely was itself a victory of sorts — amazingly, Great Britain failed to do so in the previous five major championships.

Turnaround: The Women's 4x100m team won gold in Zurich but had failed to qualify for the London 2012 games

The most remarkable turnaround in fortune has been for the women’s 4x100m team. They were not good enough to qualify for London 2012 but won bronze at the World Championships last year and now gold, breaking that national record.

Mo Farah reflected: ‘What impressed me the most here was the attitude of Adam Gemili, how humble he is and the fact that he just gets on with it.’

Champion: James Dasaolu sprinted to the 100m title in Zurich and will hope to challenge Usain Bolt soon

Double winner: Martyn Rooney sprinted to the 400m title and anchored the 4x400m relay team to gold
