Striker Diego Costa has vowed to do his utmost to deliver trophies for Chelsea.

The Brazil-born Spain striker joined the Blues from Atletico Madrid, who he helped to a first Primera Division title in 18 years, breaking the duopoly of Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Jose Mourinho's Chelsea are chasing a first Barclays Premier League crown since 2010 when the new season kicks off next month.

Costa carries a heavy burden, with Mourinho bemoaning his strikers last term and Chelsea's forward recruits having a history of struggling to make a prolonged impression, Didier Drogba apart.

Costa told Chelsea TV: 'I'd say to the fans that you need to be confident that I personally will fight for this club to make sure we are in contention to win as many trophies as possible

'I'm part of a great group here of players and we will do everything we can to give the fans what they want - and that's titles.'
