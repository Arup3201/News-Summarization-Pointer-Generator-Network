Row: Newham mayor Sir Robin Wales has been accused of trying to 'suppress diversity' in the London borough

A Labour mayor is under fire after banning foreign newspapers from libraries and cutting translation services to encourage immigrants to speak English.

Sir Robin Wales claimed he was trying to prevent ‘apartheid’ in the London borough of Newham.

He has invested public money in English lessons and refused to fund events which are only aimed at one section of the community.

The Tories accused Sir Robin of trying to suppress diversity in one of the country’s most diverse areas.

Critics also claim the cuts are designed to attract more white working class people into the area.

Around 139,000 of Newham’s residents were born in England, while 130,000 were born outside of the European Union.

Sir Robin told the BBC Asian Network programme: ‘I’m very strongly of the view that if you try and segregate people into different groups and try to keep them separate, that’s not only bad for everybody [else], it’s bad for the particular community you do it to.

‘Apartheid was wrong in South Africa, it would be wrong here.’

He went on: ‘Far from suppressing diversity, we respect and champion it. We are the most ethnically diverse borough in Europe and the evidence proves our approach of bringing our residents together is the right one.

‘Almost 90 per cent of our residents say this is a place where people from different backgrounds get on well together. We bring people together in a large number of ways including a range of annual free community events - attended by almost 100,000 this year.

‘It is absurd of anyone to say I dislike Newham. I love the borough, I have lived here for 35 years and I am proud to call it my home. We are building on everything that is great about Newham to make it a better place for everyone who lives, works and visits here.’

The council has begun giving £250 grants to street parties involving all but declining to support ‘single community’ events.

In the last year it has also rejected an application for a 'super mosque' in the borough.

Andrew Boff, Leader of the Conservative group on the Greater London Assembly, said: ‘I don’t think [Sir Robin] actually likes Newham. I think he wants to change it to some other borough. I think he’s a bit ashamed.

‘Integration is either respecting diversity or trying to suppress it and I think there’s more suppressing going on.

‘What’s happening in Newham is a big backwards step.’
