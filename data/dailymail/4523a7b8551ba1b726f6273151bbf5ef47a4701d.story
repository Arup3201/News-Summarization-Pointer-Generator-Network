A grandmother has been reunited with her French penpal 40 years after the pair lost touch – after bumping into her at an Aldi supermarket.

Sue Ellis, 60, recognised her former penpal Yvette Pearson when she overheard her Parisian accent while waiting at the checkout of her local Aldi store in Hednesford, Staffordshire.

Incredibly, the women, who wrote to each other for four years when they were teenagers in the late 1960s, discovered they had both moved to the same town and were living just one mile apart.

The women became penpals when they were teenagers (together above) and wrote to each other for years

However, after a lengthy period of letter-sending and meeting-up, the pair eventually lost touch in the 1970s

Ms Ellis, a retired police constable, first started writing to Mrs Pearson when they were both 14 and the pair met up a number of times in their late teens.

However, the women - who both recently celebrated their 60th birthdays - eventually lost touch and drifted apart a few years later in the early 1970s.

Mrs Pearson then moved to the UK when she finished her studies in 1976 and married Steve Pearson - a friend of Sue's ex-boyfriend.

Ms Ellis had no idea her French friend was living in England, even though she had introduced her to Steve on one of her visits from Paris.

In a bizarre coincidence, both of the women eventually ended moving to the Staffordshire town of Hednesford – and now live just one mile apart.

However, they had no idea they were living so close to each other until they bumped into each other for the first time in 40 years at Aldi last August.

They are now best friends, meeting up twice a week for coffee, and were guest of honour at each others 60th birthday party.

They were reunited when Ms Ellis (right) spotted her former penpal at Aldi last year and they have since become best friends, visiting each other several times a month and even attended each others birthday party

They both unearthed their former letters, which they sent to each other in the late 1960s and early 1970s

The letters, each carefully preserved and dated, show how the pair kept up-to-date with each others news

In one heart-warming letter, which was unearthed in the attic, Ms Ellis addresses the note to 'my best friend' 

Ms Ellis, who lives with her partner Steve Price, 59, said: 'I was standing at the checkout and I saw a woman in front of me and just knew I'd seen her somewhere before.

'I just couldn't place her but suddenly she spoke and I recognised her slight French accent.

'It's really funny to hear Yvette speak now as she still says some phrases in a really Midlands accent.

'We were chatting for ages blocking the entrance and then we saw each other a few days later and I went around her house which was less than a mile from mine.

'We now see each other every week and met up in time for her to come to my 60th party in September and I went to hers in January.

'It really is weird, even though we have been apart for 40 years it is like no time has passed and we are best friends again.'

Mrs Pearson, who works as a French teacher, added: 'Sue came over to me as she'd seen me come out of the shop on her way in and watched me for a while to make sure it was me.

In the box of  correspondence sent to one another in the 1960s and 1970s, the pair found this photo of Mrs Pearson in her hometown of Ivry near Paris, aged 15 in 1970. It was the first she sent to Ms Ellis of herself

One letter Mrs Pearson sent to Ms Ellis describes what she will wear when she arrives off the plane from France. It was sent to her penfriend when she was just 17-years-old and has been kept hidden away until now

One letter sent from Mrs Pearson to her penpal calls her 'My dear Sue, my best friend' and is dated 1973

'She just said my name and I couldn't place her but knew that I knew her.

'I started looking down her face and then she smiled and I knew straight away that it was Sue.

'I knew the second that I saw that smile. It was fantastic.

'It was really nice too because we met just two weeks before her surprise 60th birthday party so her partner turned up at my door and asked me to go to that.

'Through my whole career I've told the kids I teach that if they get the chance to have a penfriend they should take it because you never know where it will lead.'

The women were randomly matched as penpals when Ms Ellis was a pupil at Pool Hayes Comprehensive in Willenhall, West Midlands, and Mrs Pearson was living in Ivry-sur-Seine in Paris.

They wrote to each other every few months until the early 1970s when they started to plan to meet for the first time.

Mrs Pearson came to the UK to visit around seven times while Ms Ellis only managed to afford to go to France once before they drifted apart around the age of 18.

Ms Ellis, who worked as a police officer and as an advanced technician in the ambulance service, stayed in the Midlands and moved to Hednesford 20 years ago.

Her former penpal settled in Cheslyn Hay, Staffordshire, for 30 years after marrying Steve in 1976 before moving to Hednesford in July 2013.

Ms Ellis, who has three children and three grandchildren, has now found a bag in her attic crammed with 20 letters, ticket stubs and postcards from when they were penfriends.

In the correspondence, the teenage schoolgirls talk about music, fashion and their families, as well as making arrangements for their first ever meeting.

On one occasion, Mrs Pearson pleads with Ms Ellis to send her make-up and says she will send Parisian magazines, cigarettes and perfume in exchange.

The pair have enjoyed reading back through all their letters and correspondence, which they sent as teens

The pair reignited their friendship after bumping into each other at Aldi in Hednesford, Staffordshire (above)

Speaking about her trips to visit Ms Ellis in Willenhall, Mrs Pearson - who has three children and four grandchildren - added: 'I absolutely loved going to the Mander Centre, it was brand new and the shops were so cheap compared to Paris.

'We'd go shopping and then share a banana split at the Golden Egg across from Beatties.

'I just fell in love with Wolverhampton and couldn't get enough of it.'

Ms Ellis added: 'I was desperate to go and see Paris after Yvette had been here a few times.

'I swapped my job from Tesco in the Mander Centre to Sainsbury's in the Wulfrun Centre because they paid more and I needed the money for my airfare which was #26, a month's wages.

'Yvette was absolutely amazed that we ate chips in the street and straight out of last night's newspapers.'
