For centuries Cambridge students have worn their distinctive 
graduation robes to receive their degrees from the ancient university.

But
 now the sight of graduates in their academic dress could be a little 
different after it rewrote its traditional dress code to avoid upsetting
 transgender students.

From October, male students will be allowed
 to wear skirts to pick up their degree certificates while female 
students will be able to choose to wear men’s suits and white bow ties.

Cambridge graduation day: Students have traditionally worn graduation robes over dark suits with a white shirt and white bow tie for men, and demure black dresses , suits or skirts with white shirts for women

Under
 the old rules, men had to wear dark suits with a white shirt, white bow
 tie and academic bands with black shoes and dark socks when they 
attended graduation.

Women could either wear a black dress , suit 
or skirt with a white shirt and smart shoes. They were also asked to 
cover their legs and arms.

The dress codes were strictly enforced and students who broke the rules could be refused graduation.

But the centuries old rules based on gender will be dropped when the new academic year starts in October.

Students
 will still be required to dress smartly for their graduations, but they
 will have the freedom to choose what clothes they wear underneath their
 academic gowns and hoods.

The reforms have been introduced after a campaign by the student union’s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender group.

The
 group said that the requirement for graduates to dress in the clothes 
traditionally associated with their sex was ‘distressing’ for some 
students.

Charlie Bell, President of the Cambridge University 
Student Union LGBT+ group, said: ‘After a number of discussions at CUSU 
LGBT+, we decided it was time to act to ask the university to remove the
 gendered nature of their advice for graduation dress.

‘This has 
now been done through the Council, and I am delighted at how easy it has
 been, and how helpful the university has been throughout.

‘It’s a
 pleasure, at times like this, to belong to a university which not only 
talks the talk about equalities, but walks the walk too. I hope the 
colleges follow suit and that the gender label for graduation becomes 
truly something of the past.’

Mr Bell, 24, who is a medicine 
graduate from Queen’s College, added: ‘This was an issue that many 
students had talked to us about over the years.

‘From now on, 
trans students shouldn’t have to go through the sometimes distressing 
rigmarole of persuading their praelector (the college fellow who 
presents students during their graduation ceremony) that they can wear 
the outfit they feel more comfortable with.

‘It’s good to see the 
university receptive to helping us make changes to tradition when 
tradition no longer fits reality. But like in any city, or university, 
many hearts and minds still have to be changed before gender and 
sexuality stops being an issue, and just is.’

A Cambridge 
University spokesman said: ‘These amendments, proposed on the 
recommendation of CUSU LGBT+ and after consultation with the 
Senate-House Syndicate and the Praelectors of the Colleges, replace a 
reference to male dress with a gender-neutral description.’

Cambridge University holds its graduation ceremonies in the Senate House, built in 1730.

Mortarboards, often associated with graduation ceremonies, are optional and most students choose not to wear one.

Oxford University introduced similar rules allowing male students to wear dresses last year.
