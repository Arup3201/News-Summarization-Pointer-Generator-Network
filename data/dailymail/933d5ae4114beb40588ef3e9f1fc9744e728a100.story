Businessman Timothy Turner originally claimed he had been forced to take part in the raid by unknown people

A company director who took part in a gang raid on a brothel to try to solve his financial problems has been jailed for four and a half years.

Timothy Turner, 33, posed as a customer and made an appointment at the Exclusive Girls brothel in Camberley, Surrey.

He joined three other masked raiders, armed with guns and a machete, at the raid and made away with nearly £1,000.

One gang member, armed with a loaded shotgun, threatened to shoot brothel manager Miranda Fuoco and hit her in the face with a gun butt, leaving her bleeding and with loose teeth.

Customer Eddie Lau was robbed of £150 and his debit card while three prostitutes fled the detached house in Crawley Ridge.

Turner, of Vale Road, Ash Vale, was arrested after Mr Lau reported the getaway car's registration number.

He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob at Guildford Crown Court and admitted a separate charge of possessing cannabis.

Jailing Turner, Judge Michael Addison said: 'It must have been a terrifying experience for Ms Fuoco.'

The judge said that the use of the loaded shotgun to threaten and attack the brothel manager was an aggravating feature of the case, though he acknowledged the defendant was not the man who attacked Ms Fuoco.

Gino Connor, prosecuting, said Ms Fuoco had opened the door of the property to what she believed was a customer with a booking.

The balaclava-clad gang charged into the house, led by the man with the shotgun described in court as the ringleader.

He screamed at Ms Fuoco: 'Where's the f***ing money?'

Mr Connor said: 'He threatened to chop off her head and slice her face. She was almost delirious with shock.

'She was gratuitously struck on the side of her mouth with the butt of a firearm.'

Ms Fuoco eventually told the gang that there was cash hidden in the kitchen.

When the man with the shotgun got his hands on the cash, about £980, he yelled: 'Is that it? You're f***ing kidding me.'

Mr Connor said: 'The woman believed she would be killed because of the way that he was behaving.

'Because the men were wearing balaclavas, it's not possible to say which part the defendant played.'

The businessman, described as a man of 
previous good character, ran three cafes but had borrowed money from 
someone 'extremely dangerous' after running into financial problems.

The £980 was found at his home, along with a BB handgun and machete-style weapon.

Police also found thousands of pounds unconnected with the robbery, as well as shotguns for which Turner held a firearms certificate.

Philip Rule, defending, said his client had been reluctant to get involved in the robbery on December 2 2011 and was not the gang member who attacked Ms Fuoco.

Turner originally claimed he had been forced to take part in the raid by others unknown.

But Judge Addison refused the basis of Turner's plea.

Mr Rule said: 'This has been a salutary experience for Mr Turner. He does express remorse.'

The court was told that the premises where the raid took place is under new ownership and is no longer a brothel.
