Sci-Fi films such as Minority Report show people controlling computer programmes with expansive hand gestures.

And now there's a gadget called Flow that will allow users to do just that, which could one day replace the computer mouse. 

Flow is designed to be more sensitive than a mouse and will allow people to edit documents, draw and control apps by touching it or swiping in mid air above the gadget. 

Flow, a gadget that responds to gestures and touch could be used to edit documents, draw and control apps, replacing the computer mouse

It can be programmed with shortcuts for more than 30 applications, enabling users to control Spotify with the flick of their wrist or use it to manipulate images in Photoshop. 

The gadget, designed by engineers in Berlin, Germany, works alongside a desktop or laptop via a Bluetooth connection, with apps such as Final Cut Pro X, SoundCloud, Spotify and YouTube. 

The engineers and computer scientists are raising money on crowd funding site Indiegogo to put Flow into production.

Flow (pictured) works alongside a desktop or laptop via a Bluetooth connection, with apps such as Final Cut Pro X, SoundCloud, Spotify and YouTube. For example, a user could programme the device to skip tracks in a Spotify playlist by swiping in mid-air over the device

Flow  will allow users to manipulate images and documents using hand gestures, such as in sci-fi films like Minority Report (a screenshot is pictured) - without the light-up gloves

To begin with, the device will support Macs, with iOS devices, Android, Windows and Linux support in the pipeline. It could be used alongside work equipment or in the home (pictured) which may mean that smart appliances could one day be controlled using the simple device

Description: A programmable wireless controller that is small enough to fit in a pocket and could one day replace the computer mouse.

Materials: A metal ring and polycarbonate touch surface.

Connectivity: Bluetooth LE/4.1.

Compatibility: Macs, with more operating systems in the pipeline - starting with 30 popular apps.

Battery: Four months.

Size: Almost three inches (7cm) in diameter and half an inch (1.5cm) high.

Sensors: 360° angular positioning, capacitive touch, light and infrared hand gesture recognition.

They say: ‘We work on graphic design, video editing or CAD on a daily basis. Keyboard and mouse are great but they are far from giving you the same sensitivity and abilities as your hand.

‘The same applies for music, browsing or presentations. We need a tool that gives us flexible shortcuts and perfect control, a tool that makes the things we love fast, precise, intuitive and fun.

‘That's why we created Flow, a freely programmable wireless controller.’  

The team combined three technologies into their small circular device so it can recognise hand gestures, sensitive touch and precise haptics (such as being tapped) via sensors. 

They say that controls for more than 30 popular applications will be available at launch with more becoming available week by week.

‘Let us know which shortcuts or controls are important to you and we'll get right to work,’ they wrote.

The engineers creayed Flow beacuse they said that the computer mouse is ' far from giving you the same sensitivity and abilities as your hand,' whereas their gadget has more sensing capabilities

The gadget is open source so users with some coding know-how will be able to build new shortcuts and applications.

Flow is available to pre-order via Indiegogo for $99 plus shipping, with an estimated delivery date of June 2015.

Samsung has revealed a next-generation kind of eye tracking mouse, called EyeCan+.

When positioned below a computer monitor, the portable box allows disabled people to write documents or browse the internet by blinking and moving their eyes.

The device works by wirelessly calibrating with the user's eye as long as they sit or lie between 23 inches (60cm) and 27 inches (70cm) away from the monitor.

EyeCan+ only needs to be set up when a person uses it for the first time and remembers individuals’ eye characteristics.

The gadget was developed by Samsung engineers in their spare time, with help from quadriplegic grad student Hyung-Jin Shin.

By using the system for 17 months, the team were able to refine the tracking system - a number of which will be built for charities.

The technology is open source so that anyone can commercialise it.
