One thousand millionaires are expected to be created today as Facebook sells its shares for the first time.

In one of the biggest ever Wall Street flotations, the social networking site will sell 421million shares at up to £24 a share.

A successful sale will see the company’s value soar to about £64billion – bigger than the combined worth of Ford and Boeing.

Mark Zuckerberg, who created Facebook at university eight years ago, is likely to become one of the world’s richest men.

His 28 per cent stake in the company could net him as much as £18billion.

Hundreds of other Facebook staff and those who invested in the company during its infancy will become millionaires.

A smattering of the 100 London-based staff may also become millionaires.

Among them will almost certainly be Joanna Shields, the vice-president and managing director of Facebook’s Europe, Middle East and Asia division.

The 49-year-old executive, who lives in London with her husband, Formula 1 team boss Andy Stevenson, will be one  of the biggest British-based beneficiaries of the share sale. Facebook was planning to sell  337million shares but increased that figure to 421million because of huge demand.

Despite the interest in the stock, some analysts are uncertain as to how long Facebook can maintain its rapid growth.

Some advertisers are starting to wonder if the site is actually worth the money. They are particularly concerned about the number of users who are accessing Facebook on their smartphones whose screens are too small for advertisements to be effective.

On Tuesday the carmaker  General Motors, which is America’s third largest advertiser, decided to pull all its ads from the site, claiming no one was clicking on them.

Analysts predict that other advertisers may reach the same conclusion. Richard Hunter, from the City stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, believes the shares will perform well in the short term, but then face an uncertain future.

Mr Hunter said: ‘It is then down to the company to convince  analysts and investors that the confidence was well founded and that Facebook will be mentioned in the same breath as the likes  of Apple and Google in the years to come.

‘Ten years ago, there was no such thing as Facebook, or the iPhone or the iPad.

‘In the meantime some of the “next big things” have come and gone, such as MySpace.

‘Perhaps the only certainty is that the companies which remain are those which have been able to adapt, adjust, innovate and remain incredibly popular on a huge scale.’

He added: ‘That is a major consideration for potential Facebook investors.’

City spread betting firm Spreadex said Facebook shares could increase in value by more than  40 per cent after the first day.

The website’s revenue last year was £2.3billion, up from £96million in 2007 – an almost 25-fold increase in just four years.
