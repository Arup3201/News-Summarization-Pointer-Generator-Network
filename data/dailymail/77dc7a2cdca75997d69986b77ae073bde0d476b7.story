The father of Ram Singh, the key accused in the December 16 gang-rape case, has dismissed the police version of his son's death inside Tihar Jail and demanded a CBI probe to bring out the truth.

Mange Lal Singh said his son could not have committed suicide even though he was reportedly facing harassment inside the prison.

"We had been meeting him during trial and otherwise, and we know that he couldn't have committed suicide… he had only one good, functional arm, how could he have committed suicide," he said.

In a shocking claim, the father said 
Ram Singh had told him that he was sodomised inside the jail. "Jail mein
uska balatkar hua."

He also claimed that he had seen blade marks on his son's body during a jail visit.

Mr Singh said: "He (Ram Singh) was murdered and hanged...evidence is being tampered, and I want a CBI probe and commitment of security for my other son (Mukesh, also an accused in the gang-rape case)."

Many people at the Ravi Dass camp who knew Ram Singh expressed disbelief at his alleged suicide.

The infamous slum cluster in South Delhi's R.K. Puram was home to four of the six accused in the gang-rape incident which triggered national outrage in December last year.

"We can't be sure that a man like him could commit suicide. Anyway, it couldn't have been better that the monster is dead. No one should cry over it," said an elderly woman living close to the house of the deceased.

Ram Singh's father occasionally visits the family's house in the R.K. Puram slum cluster, though the families of the gang-rape defendants are treated as social outcasts in the area

In the wake of the incident, which was discovered early on March 11, the families of two other defendants - Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta - were worried about their safety inside the jail.

These families are already treated as social outcasts in the locality.

"Even though my son didn't have anything to do with the (gang-rape) incident or Ram Singh, we know that Singh couldn't have committed suicide. Not at this stage when the police's case is so weak. Will they do the same to Vinay too? I am worried. He's innocent. Someone save him," said Champa Devi, Vinay's mother.

She said she found out about the alleged suicide through neighbours, and maintained her son was innocent.

"He has only been arrested because of that unfortunate association with monster Ram Singh," she said.

Champa Devi claimed her son's reported statement of guilt, in which he reportedly said the accused should be hanged for what they had done, was made "under duress".

"That was extracted out of him by force... I am really worried about him now," she said.

Ram Singh's father has been visiting the otherwise locked house belonging to the family in the slum cluster.

"He (Mange Lal) comes around the time when there is a chance to meet his sons at the court, but none of us interacts with him," another woman at the camp said.

Hira Lal, whose son Pawan is the fourth man accused of involvement in the gang-rape, lives with the rest of his family a few meters from Ram Singh's residence. He was also shocked by the news.

"I am concerned about my son, yes! I will even go to the authorities tomorrow and check with them about the safety arrangements for him but there isn't much I can do. I am poor and have to earn a living for the rest of my family," Lal said. 

Every time there's a criminal case in Delhi that attracts media attention, chief minister Sheila Dikshit raises her voice against the police working under the Union home ministry's control.

Despite making public statements about it, the chief minister is reportedly yet to make an official request to the home ministry.

Taking her on, Union home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said on Monday that she had made no official communication to the home ministry requesting that control of Delhi Police be transferred to the state government.

Home Minister S.K. Shinde (left) said that if chief minister Sheila Dikshit (right) wants control of Delhi Police, she should make an official request to his ministry.

"She should write to us about the Delhi Police being placed under the state government. She is a senior leader, we will consider it if she writes to us officially," he said.

Senior officers of the Delhi Police have always expressed reservations about the prospect of the force coming under the control of the state government. Nonetheless, the chief minister has pressed on with her campaign to gain control of the state police to ensure better functioning and coordination with the city government.

Sheila has always been vocal about the deteriorating law and order in the Capital. After the December 16 gang-rape case, she reiterated her demand for placing the local police under the direct control of her government.

Dikshit also attacked Delhi Police commissioner Neeraj Kumar after the incident, which led to mass protests demanding immediate action to make Delhi safer for women. She was not alone. Even her MP son Sandeep Dikshit joined in and openly expressed his views on the inefficiency of the Delhi Police.

"He never told his family that he was depressed. There was no reason for Ram Singh to commit suicide. There is foul play," said V.K. Anand, the lawyer of the main defendant in the December 16 gang-rape case.

He was seconded by other defence counsels in the case, who termed Ram's death a "well-planned murder" and refuted all theories of it being a suicide.

They said they were informed by the four adult defendants on Monday that they were being subjected to harassment in Tihar Jail.

Lawyer V.K. Anand, who represented Ram Singh, said his client did not appear depressed and had no reason to take his own life

Talking to reporters in Saket, where a fast-track court is conducting the trial in the case, Anand said: "Till date, he did not say that his life was in danger or he was depressed. His family was being given access to meet him regularly."

But he added that on Monday the other accused, who appeared with their faces uncovered for the first time that day, had expressed apprehensions about going back to Tihar.

"They don't want to go back to Tihar. They are being abused, slapped around and sexually harassed. They said they are being treated like animals," claimed Anand, who is also defending Ram's brother Mukesh.

Advocate A.P. Singh, who is representing two other defendants Vinay Sharma and Akshay Thakur, blamed the Delhi government for Singh's "murder", saying that the government had got him killed.

"The government wanted to gain some brownie points before the assembly elections," the lawyer claimed.

Both the lawyers said they would move pleas to enhance the security of the accused in the case.

A.P. Singh said he will move the Supreme Court seeking the transfer of his clients to some other nearby jail in Haryana or Uttar Pradesh, while Anand said he will seek to have the trial transferred to a court outside Delhi.

Meanwhile, the fast-track court sought a report  on the alleged suicide from Tihar officials by Tuesday.

The other defendants lodged in Tihar Jail told their lawyers they are being abused, threatened and sexually harassed

The family of "India's daughter", the young paramedic student raped and fatally injured on December 16, reacted to the news of Ram Singh's alleged suicide with a sense of resignation.

"Ram Singh should have been hanged in public, but fate had a different plan. I am shocked but not saddened," the victim's brother said, adding that there was no point in blaming the staff and authorities at Tihar.

"If a person wants to commit suicide, he will do it anyway. We cannot blame anyone for the incident," he said.

Refusing to believe the conspiracy theory that Singh may have been murdered, he said he was most likely killed by his guilt.

"I think he must have felt guilty about the incident because he hurt an innocent person in such a brutal manner. Ram Singh was aware that he could be sentenced to death," he said.

"All the other accused should get the death sentence," he added.

The victim's father appeared worried that the suicide might damage the ongoing trial.

"I am worried that the suicide might affect the trial, which has been going on smoothly so far," he said.
