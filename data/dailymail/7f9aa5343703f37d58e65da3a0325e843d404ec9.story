This is the moment a man dressed as 'Friday The 13th' slasher Jason Voorhees was dragged out of a  city centre pub by armed police after locals mistook his  fancy dress knife for a real machete.

Shaun McKeon, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, was dressed up as the hockey mask-wearing horror villain  for a themed fancy dress party last Friday - the 13th - complete with toy wooden knives.

Mr McKeon, 26, said him and his friends were 'all quite big horror fans' and he  decided to model his costume on Friday The 13th Part VI.

In the film Jason wears a  utility belt with fake weapons including a machete, hunting knife and throwing  darts.

Unlucky for some: Shaun McKeon, dressed as Friday The 13th slasher Jason Voorhees, was bundled to the floor and handcuffed by armed police officers after someone called 999 - fearing his fake weapons were real

But armed response officers were dispatched after police received reports that 'a  masked man was walking around Leeds city centre carrying what appeared to be  knives at 5.25pm'.

Officers found him at the Angel Inn, pinning him  to the ground and handcuffing him before pulling him towards police cars.

Mr McKeon said the officers had tasers and he feared he was going to get shocked

Mr McKeon explained: 'I was at The Angel Inn drinking for a good  half an hour before the police turned up in force with guns and dogs.

'Though I was still in costume they managed to walk right past me twice before  I gathered that they were there because of the fake weapons I had brought, so I  handed my bag to the plain-clothes officer to be checked.

'At this point it was quite obvious to all, including the plain-clothes officer,  that I posed no threat whatsoever but the police still dragged me to the ground  and cuffed me anyway.'

He added he has gone out dressed in the same costume many times before without incident.

Mr McKeon, who makes horror costumes as a hobby, accepted the knives looked authentic but believes the police should have used some common sense.

He said: The costume does look realistic. But I have been out like this many times before and this has never happened.

'I think the police should have really used a bit of sense.

'When I got on the bus I said to the driver these aren't real and he said "yeah I got that".'

He claims that when police arrived at the pub, a plain-clothed officer emptied his bag of weapons and brushed his hand over them.

Shaun said: 'He seemed happy with that but then his friends came over, hauled me off the bench and handcuffed me. They had tasers and I thought I was going to get shocked, I think some of them had beanbag guns.

'After handcuffing me they took me on to the street and searched me before finally letting me go.

'The whole thing probably lasted about 25 minutes and after they were happy the knives were fake they let me go and we carried on our night out.'

A drinker who saw the scene unfold said: 'It all felt a bit heavy-handed really, he was just a lad in fancy dress'

A barman
 at the pub, who did not wish to be named, told: 'The police rang and  
asked if we knew of anyone wearing a Friday 13th Jason outfit, they said
 there  had been reports of this guy carrying a machete through town.

'We told them he was at the pub, and the next thing we knew, they were here  looking for him.'

Liz
 Goodwill, 53, of Leeds, who was drinking on the benches outside the 
pub,  said: 'This guy was drinking with around half a dozen friends 
outside the pub.

'We weren't really paying attention to him, they looked like students just  having a couple of drinks.

'The
 next thing I knew, around five police officers, wearing armour vests,  
bullet-proof vests, and with two police Alsatian dogs, were running down
 the  alleyway to the pub.

'This
 guy was shouting, "I haven't done anything wrong". But they pulled him 
 away and up towards the police cars which were parked at the top of the
 alley.

'It all felt a bit heavy-handed really, he was just a lad in fancy dress.'

West Yorkshire Police have since issued a warning about the 'distress' caused  by carrying toy weapons in public.

Superintendent
 Sam Miller of Leeds District Police said: 'This incident took  place 
during a two hour period in Leeds in which officers were deployed to a  
number of genuine emergencies including serious assaults, domestic 
incidents,  road traffic collisions and searches for missing people, 
which gives an  indication of how busy we frequently are.

'Residents
 quite rightly phoned us to inform us they had seen a man carrying  what
 appeared to be knives and as a result we had to dispatch critical  
resources to locate this individual.

'These were resources which could have been better deployed dealing with  genuine emergencies.'

Not dangerous: Mr McKeon said it was obvious he presented to danger to anyone, but he was still handcuffed, pinned and marched to a police car. But officers said this sort of incident wastes police time

He added: 'Officers were able to locate him and after checking the items he was carrying  were toys he was dealt with and given suitable advice.

'We would remind everyone that carrying toy weapons in these circumstances can  cause real distress as the items may well be mistaken by residents for the real  thing, as in this case.

'Such items should not be displayed and anyone who does so can expect to be  stopped by police and appropriately dealt with'
