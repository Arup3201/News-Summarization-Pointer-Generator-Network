It's the luxury holiday to die another day for, but at up to $8,000 a night you'll need a fair bit of moneypenny if you want to stay for long.

Imagine sipping vodka martinis while taking in a glorious Caribbean sunset at the very spot where the world's most famous super spy was born.

The lavish Goldeneye resort in Jamaica is where James Bond creator Ian Fleming dreamt up his most famous creation.

Double O-Heaven: The luxurious Goldeneye resort in Jamaica is where Ian Fleming penned all 14 James Bond novels

The lavish Goldeneye resort, in Jamaica, offers guests the chance to soak up the atmosphere that inspired 007 author Ian Fleming

All 14 of the James Bond novels were 
penned there, and guests can still sit at Fleming's original wooden desk
 where he imagined the adventures of the British lothario.

Ian Fleming built his villa on the site of a former donkey race track

Fleming bought the 15 acre plot, which 
had formerly been a donkey race track, in 1946 after hearing about the 
the property from a friend. His villa, which overhangs the sea was based
 on a sketch he made.

The property, near the town of Oracabessa, was also owned by Reggae superstar Bob marley who purchased it in 1976,12 years after Fleming's death.

Marley then sold the property to the current owner, Chris Blackwell, founder of the Island record label, who used it as a place to entertain friends before opening a small hotel.

A spokesperson for the luxury destination said: 'Fleming Villa is like an island unto itself.

'If you're looking for privacy then Fleming Villa, along with its satellite cottages, Pool House and Sweet Spot, is the perfect choice.

'You can enjoy your own beach, pool, gardens, and staff. Walk over to GoldenEye for a spa treatment, for sunset cocktails at the Bizot Bar, for dinner at the Gazebo. Walk back to Fleming Villa and, again, you're secluded.

Romance: Guests can expect to fork out as much as £5000 a night to stay at the famed island location with its stunning private beaches, a relaxing spa and free water sports

'And then of course, there's the history. Fleming, and his character, James Bond.

The villa can sleep up to 10 people in five individual bedrooms, and comes with a team of full time dedicated staff so visitors don't even have to lift a finger.
