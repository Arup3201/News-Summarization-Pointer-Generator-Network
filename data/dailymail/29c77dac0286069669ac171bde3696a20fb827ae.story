He celebrated his half century yesterday with a party attended by the Queen and other ROyals.

But today Prince Edward showed no signs of heavy night as he arrived bright and early at a primary school today.

The Queen's youngest son and his wife, Countess of Wessex, paid a visit to Robert Browning primary school in Walworth, London to see work carried out by Kidscape, one of the charities to receive money from the Wessex Youth Trust, the charity the couple set up shortly before 
their marriage in 1999.

The Wessexes received a warm welcome from locals who lined the streets outside the school and gave the couple a round of applause as they arrived.

Inside the school, a group of excited children presented Edward with a large card they had made and signed themselves.

Yesterday, to mark the occasion of Edward's birthday, Buckingham Palace yesterday issued a charming new portrait of the Earl of Wessex, the title he was granted on his marriage, his wife, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and their two children The Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James, Viscount Severn.

Taken in in the panelled dining room in their Berkshire home, Bagshot Park, by photographer Millie Pilkington, who also took the private photographs at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding, it is a particularly relaxed family portrait.

To mark Prince Edward's 50th birthday, Buckingham Palace have issued a charming new portrait of the Earl of Wessex, the title he was granted on his marriage, his wife, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and their two children The Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James, Viscount Severn

Edward,
 dressed in a lilac shirt unbuttoned at the neck to display a hint of 
hairy chest, and bottle green trousers sits holding his giggling son, 
six, on the arm of his chair.

His
 daughter, ten, wearing a grey pinafore and white jumper clutches his 
arm affectionately, while his wife of almost 15 years, Sophie, smiles 
broadly as she crouches behind.

Aside
 from the release of the official portrait, the prince has determinedly 
refused to make a big deal of out his landmark birthday, granting a 
single interview to a children’s news programme.

The couple will later accompany the Queen and other senior royals to the Commonwealth Observance Service at Westminster Abbey.

The Queen’s youngest child, Prince Edward, turns 50 today.  In honour of his birthday FEMAIL round up ten facts you may not know about Prince Charles’ little brother...1. Edward was born on 10 March 1964 and is the third son and youngest child of The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. 2. The prince completed his A-Levels in History, English Literature and Economic and Political Studies in 1982, and then decided to take a gap year. During his time abroad, he worked as a house tutor teaching English and History at the Collegiate School in Wanganui, New Zealand.3. Prince Edward currently holds 4 degrees: his BA in History from Cambridge, and 2 honorary degrees. He has also been awarded The Earl of Wessex a degree by both The University of Victoria awarded and the University of Prince Edward Island. As Chancellor of the University of Bath, he holds an honorary doctorate in Law.4. In 1986, after graduating, Prince Edward decided to embark on a career in theatrical productions. He has a successful run working at two companies, including Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Theatre Company. In 1993, Edward formed his own company Ardent Productions. Prince Edward also tried his hand at a military role and started training as an Officer Cadet in the Royal Marines in 1986. He didn’t take to military life and left the Marines in January 1987.5. Prince Edward met his wife, Sophie Rhys-Jones at a tennis event in 1993. Sophie was standing in for sports personality, Sue Barker, and had to pose for promotional photos with Edward for the event, leading to the start of their relationship.6. In June 1999, the couple of six years were married at Windsor Castle. The couple requested that guests didn’t wear evening dress or hats as they wanted a low key affair. However, the Queen Mother did wear a lavender hat. Princes William and Harry, and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie attended, but the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, was not invited.7. Edward’s full title is ‘HRH, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, Viscount Severn’. The title of Earl of Wessex was given to him by The Queen, on his wedding day. The last person to hold that title was Harold II, who died at the Battle of Hastings, 1066. Prince Edward is now 7th in line to the throne.8. In 2002, Edward and his wife both quit their private jobs in order to support The Queen during her jubilee. The Prince is currently involved with over 79 organisations, many in aid of charities that provide opportunities for young people.9. Edward has become heavily involved with the Duke of Edinburgh Award ever since achieving the Gold Award himself in 1986. After the passing of both his parents, it is intended that Prince Edward will be granted the title of Duke of Edinburgh.

10. The Prince became a father for the first time in November 2003. Despite birth complications, the Prince and his wife welcomed Lady Windsor into their family. The couple had their second child a year later, a boy, James, Viscount Severn.

In
 recent years Edward, often cited as the Queen’s favoured son, has 
become something of the quiet man of the British monarchy, conducting 
258 engagements last year with little fanfare.

He
 is also considered the successor to his father’s Duke of Edinburgh 
Awards scheme and been handed the plum role of International Trustee and
 Chairman of the International Council.

This has resulted in him becoming one of the most well-travelled members of the royal family last year.

In
 2013 he conducted 87 engagement overseas, bettered only by his wife - 
who carried out 95 - and Prince Charles, who also clocked up 95 jobs but
 undertook two lengthy foreign tours on behalf of the British 
government. The couple were in Barbados and Jamaica only last week.

It is, perhaps, seen as a reward for years of quiet service after being forced to give up his chosen career.

After leaving university, Edward famously joined the Royal Marines but dropped out of training within months.

He
 decided to pursue a career in entertainment, starting off as a 
production assistant for Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Theatre 
Company but also produced the ill-fate It’s A Royal Knockout in 1987.

In
 1993 he formed his own company, Ardent Productions, but was accused of 
profiting out of his position by making a series of royal documentaries

The
 company made a series of losses until, in 2001, one of his own film 
crews invaded his nephew, Prince William’s privacy, while he was 
studying in Scotland by secretly filming him, causing a public – and 
private – furore.

The 
following year it was announced that he and his wife, whose own PR 
business had been similarly dogged by controversy, would give up their 
business interests to concentrate on their royal duties.

Friends,
 however, say Edward, who is now eighth-in-line to the throne, is happy 
and relaxed in his new role as a dutiful son and now father.

He and his wife tried for several years to start a family and suffered the devastating loss of an ectopic pregnancy.

One
 friend said: ‘It really is lovely to see Edward and Sophie sitting down
 on the floor playing with their children. They are such hand-on parents
 and totally unstuffy. Louise and James were much longed-for children 
and are the centre of their world.’

Earlier
 this year it was revealed that Louise, the Queen’s youngest 
grand-daughter, had undergone surgery to correct a severe squint she had
 since birth.

This latest portrait shows the surgery appears to have been successful.
