The day before Mother's Day this year, police received a call from a wife frantic because her husband, who suffers Alzheimer's disease, had gone missing from the Little Rock, Arkansas home.

Police found Melvin Amrine two blocks from their home, unable to tell officers where he lives.

However, he wasn't confused as to where he was going: he was buying his wife Doris flowers for Mother's Day, as he had every year since she had given birth to their first child.

Heart and mind: Alzheimer's sufferer Melvyn Amrine went on a mission to buy his wife Doris flowers on Mother's Day, and received a little help from officers who had been dispatched to find him

Melvyn Amrine has been slowly deteriorating since he was diagnosed with the condition three years ago.

His wife has become her husband's carer, watching helplessly as the cruel disease steals her husband's memories and personality away from him.

Officers radioed dispatch to say they would take the elderly man straight home - but Melvyn Amrine was having none of that.

'He was pretty adamant,' Officer Troy Dillard told CBS.

Devotion: Although Melvyn Amrine can't remember whether he proposed to Doris or she proposed to him (it was the former), he did remember to do something he's done for her every Mother's Day since their first child was born: bought her a bouquet of flowers

Last love: The Amrines have been married for 60 years

'He wasn't going home until he got those flowers,' Officer Brian Grigsby said. 'That's what he wanted. He wanted flowers for his wife, because tomorrow was Mother's Day.'

So
 the officers decided to help Melvyn Amrine achieve his goal, secretly 
stopping in at a local supermarket and helping him select a bouquet of 
beautiful cream-colored roses.

'We had to get those flowers,' Grigsby says. 'We had to get them. I didn't have a choice.'

The kind officers even surruptitiously slipped the cashier some extra bills when Melvyn couldn't cover the tab.

A frantic Doris Amrine was relieved when she saw her husband of 60 years walking up their front stairs in the company of the police officers, but her relief turned to joy when he presented her with the carefully selected bouquet.

'As he came up those steps, and I saw those roses and the smile on his face, I just broke inside,' Doris told CBS. 'I just said, "Thank you, thank you." Because I saw his heart.'

'It's special, because even though the mind doesn't remember everything, the heart remembers.'
