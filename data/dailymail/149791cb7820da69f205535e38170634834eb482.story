Ministers have launched a review of the free nursery milk scheme amid evidence taxpayers are being ripped off by more than £10million a year.

Ministers claim that milk being supplied via 'middle men' has seen the Government billed up to £1 a pint – while it can be bought in shops for an average of 36p.

They have warned that the cost of the scheme has doubled in four years to £53million, which could soar to £76million by 2016 unless costs are curbed.

Milking it: All under-fives receive a third of a pint free each day

Public Health Minister Anne Milton said the Government would then face being overcharged £20million a year.

But the review has prompted toxic 
allegations of 'milk snatching' by critics who warned that it will lead 
to a fall in the 1.5 million children who currently benefit from free 
milk.

The Government's Nursery Milk scheme 
provides under-fives with a third of a pint every day. Older children 
entitled to free school meals are also offered free milk.

The Government's review was launched 
after it emerged from the Department of Health that 'middle men' – firms
 which supply nurseries, schools and childminders with milk and claim 
the money back directly from the Government – were deliberately ramping 
up their prices to as much as £1 a pint.

One option being considering by the 
Government would cap the amount that can be claimed back on a pint of 
milk – which could save as much as £40million a year. Another would see a
 system of national suppliers set up to cut out the middle men.

Mrs Milton yesterday insisted that the Government remained committed to providing free milk for all under-fives.

Rip-off: The Department of Health ended up over spending by millions after being over-charged for nursery school milk

Long history: The Government's Nursery Milk scheme, providing under fives with a third of a pint every day for free, dates back to 1940s and suggestions it would be axed in 2010 were quickly played down at the time

Margaret Thatcher, pictured here in 1970 with Prime Minister Edward Heath was nicknamed the 'milk snatcher' in 1971

She said: 'The current scheme has not 
changed operationally since it began, and costs have ballooned. In four 
years, costs have jumped from £27million in 2007 to a staggering 
£53million in 2011. Estimates show that modernising the scheme could 
save as much as £20million each year.'

The state first gave free milk to 
pregnant women and young children in 1940, to protect them against 
wartime shortages, and it was later extended to all schoolchildren.

However, Margaret Thatcher was dubbed the 'milk snatcher' in 1971 after scrapping free school milk for the over-sevens.

The nickname became shorthand for the 
Tories' supposedly heartless approach to spending cuts. David Cameron 
last year shot down suggestions that the free milk scheme could be axed 
completely – underlining the Tories' sensitivity over the issue.

But shadow public health minister 
Diane Abbott said: 'Trying to cut the cost of this scheme may end up 
snatching milk away from children, disproportionately affecting the 
poorest. In a recession, when there is a squeeze on families, it is the 
wrong time for risks with our children's health.'

Jon Thornes, chairman of the School 
and Nursery Milk Alliance, which is made up of a group of organisations 
that campaign to retain free milk, said: 'Drinking milk in schools, 
nurseries and while in the care of childminders is vital in helping 
children to develop important nutrition and social habits. The Nursery 
Milk scheme has proven incredibly popular and hugely successful in 
contributing to the healthy development of children.

'We will be engaging fully with the 
consultation to ensure the scheme continues to benefit as many children 
as possible – and would urge the Government to ensure its focus is on 
children's wellbeing rather than just the bottom line.'

John Sedgwick, managing director of 
milk provider Cool Milk, said: 'Making the scheme more burdensome for 
nurseries and childminders will only serve to reduce the number of 
children receiving milk.

'The risk is that the scheme will atrophy until it no longer exists. Cutting the scheme by the back door is not the answer.'
