Squatters have taken over a £5 million house in one of the most exclusive postcodes in London - because they 'can't afford' rents in the capital.

The group of Eastern Europeans moved into a large Victorian house in Highgate, north London, two weeks ago, close to the homes of supermodel Kate Moss and actor Jude Law.

They pinned a notice to the front window of Hillcrest Lodge claiming 'squatters' rights' under the Criminal Justice Act.

Valued by local estate agents at around £5million, it is directly opposite historic 18th century pub The Bull, which also became home to squatters at the end of last year.

Squatting in style: The basement of the house in Highgate, which has been inhabited for the last two weeks

Exclusive: The property is one of the most exclusive postcodes in London and has reportedly been empty for two years

The neighbours claim they were told 
by police it was 'none of their business' when they asked officers to 
take action against the squatting - and they also said the property 
developer owner is aware the house has been taken over.

However,
in a legal notice the squatters threaten him with legal action if he 
attempts to enter the building, stating: 'Any entry into these premises 
without our permission is a criminal offence as any one of us who is in 
physical possession is oppose to such entry.'

Farukl
Islam, who has owned adjoining restaurant Kiplings for 20 years, says 
he called officers after he noticed six Eastern European men moving into
the property.

He said: 'I 
saw some boys, about 18 or 19-years-old, Eastern Europeans, moving in. I
called the police and they said to me "it's none of your business".

'They
don't come out in the day time but I have seen them going in and out at
night. I am worried about how this will affect my business because I 
don't know who these guys are. I don't know if they are good guys or bad
guys. If they stay it is going to be a big problem for us.'

Mr
Islam said the property used to be owned by Haringey Council and was 
split up into flats before being bought by a property developer two 
years ago.

Too expensive: The occupants claimed they had been forced to squat in the house after being unable to afford rents in the capital

The developer began works on the building before being forced to stop when the recession hit, it was claimed.

Mr Islam said: 'He came in to see me last week and asked what happened. I told him what I had seen.'

A
24-year-old Polish occupant of the property claimed she had been forced
to squat in the house after being unable to afford rents in the 
capital.

The woman, who
did not want to be named, said: 'You have two types of squatters. Some 
people rush into these houses, but we are not that type of person.

'The owner, she knows we are here, so everything is sorted, and no-one suffers.'

She added: 'We always try to find buildings which are empty and abandoned.

'We have so many empty buildings which are just not in use and no one living in them. Why? It is a big waste.

'My
friend is a single mum and she was waiting for a very long time to get a
council flat. She was living in a squat because she couldn't afford to 
pay rent and make money. Squatting is a kind of solution.

'Squatting
for me is not forever, it is something I do for the moment. As long as I
don't hurt somebody else's feelings it is okay.'

Bricks and other debris remain strewn in the front garden.
