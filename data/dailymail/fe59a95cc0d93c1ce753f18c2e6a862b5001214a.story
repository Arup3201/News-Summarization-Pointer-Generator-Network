BYE BYE, BENOIT

Benoit Paire caused a bit of a stir following his first-round defeat on Tuesday when he told French newspaper L'Equipe that he hated Wimbledon and that the atmosphere 'displeases me greatly'.

The Frenchman will be delighted then that he can finally leave after also losing his men's doubles first-round match with Polish partner Tomasz Bednarek on Wednesday.

Paire has never gone further than the third round here.

Happy to leave? After stating he hated Wimbledon, Benoit Paire was knocked out in the doubles

MARTINA'S GUYBBC Radio5Live pundit Richard Krajicek was understandably delighted as he talked on air about the recent engagement of his half-sister Michaella to German doubles expert Martin Emmrich – the proposal took place on court at a tournament in the Netherlands.

Listeners may have been surprised to hear Martina Navratilova respond that she used to go out with Emmrich’s dad Tomas in the 1970s before becoming one of sport’s first openly gay figures when she came out in 1981.

DOUBLES DELIGHT

The mixed 
doubles at Wimbledon is the most prestigious of all the Grand Slams, 
featuring a 48-pair draw compared to 32 at the other three majors.

Former
 Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis was undoubtedly the showpiece name in
 the draw which was made yesterday as the 33-year-old teams up with 
Brazilian Bruno Soares, while the all-British pairing of Ross Hutchins 
and Heather Watson will prove popular with spectators.

Some trip: One Japan fan made his way back to his country from Brazil... via SW19, catching some of the action

LET'S BE FRANK

An iPad 
wielding employee was spotted at the Aorangi Park practice courts 
quizzing players for a satisfaction survey to gauge how they are finding
 the facilities here.

Generally,
 the players are often complimentary about their experience at SW19, 
although it would be interesting to find out the potential answers of 
Frank Dancevic after he blasted the qualifying facilities at Roehampton 
in a Facebook rant last week.

STOPOVER FUN

What better
 way to spend a few hours’ stopover in London than at Wimbledon? On his 
way home from the World Cup in Brazil where he had watched Japan v 
Greece and Chile v Spain, one Japanese man decided to head to the All 
England Club rather than hang around Heathrow Airport.

He
 spent much of his day in the queue, eventually getting in to the 
grounds around 2pm, before continuing his journey home in the evening.

Sights set: Jamie Murray claims he is more interested in the men's doubles event this year

MURRAY TARGET

Former mixed doubles champion Jamie Murray may have entered the event with Australia’s Casey Dellacqua this year but his focus is very much on adding the men’s doubles title to his collection.

Murray, after teaming up with Aussie John Peers to beat Dan Evans and James Ward on Wednesday, said:  ‘I’d rather do well in the men’s doubles. I would much rather we got a run going in that. Mixed is there to play and try to win, what happens happens.' A REPORTER? NA...

Li Na may be the second seed here but at the age of 32 is entering into the twilight of her career and has already considered what she will do when she hangs up her racket. The Chinese player has a degree in journalism but do not expect to ever see here asking rather than answering the questions at Wimbledon in the future. She said: ‘For my dream after I retire, I want to be a housewife.’

Career change? Li Na has a degree in journalism... but is more interested in becoming a housewife
