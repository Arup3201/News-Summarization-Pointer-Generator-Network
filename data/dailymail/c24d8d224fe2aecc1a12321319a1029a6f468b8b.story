A Russian student who went missing in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming has been found dead.

The body of 20-year-old Aleksandr 'Sasha' Sagiev was found in the park Friday. The student from Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, was reported missing Monday after going for a hike.

After a three-day search, Sagiev's body was discovered below a steep traverse, known as Cache Couloir, in Glacier Gulch. His body was found at an elevation of about 9,400 feet, and was removed via helicopter long-line.

Body found: Aleksandr Sagiev, 23, was last seen at a pizza restaurant three days before his body was found

The National Park Service said Friday that his body has been taken to nearby Jackson, Wyoming.

Sagiev was a seasonal employee at Dornan's Pizza & Pasta Restaurant, a shop near the park. 

He was last seen using his cellphone at the bar of the restaurant, park spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs said, and the alarm was raised when he did not turn up for his next shift.

'It's concerning because he's a very responsible person,' Skaggs said at the time.

About 60 searchers had been looking for him since he was last seen at work Sunday. 

Sagiev had spent a lot of time walking and hiking in the park since arriving in June, and rangers had talked to his friends to find out what his routes and habits were, Skaggs said.

Co-worker Nicole Nicklas said Sagiev recently talked about planning a day trip to nearby Yellowstone National Park.

On Wednesday, searchers used dogs and boats along the Snake River near the resort but found no trace of Sagiev. On Thursday, searchers said Sagiev may have been hiking Taggart, Bradley or Delta lakes.

The search was complicated by heavy rain and thick clouds near Taggart Lake Trailhead, where authorities believed Sagiev started his hike.

Authorities say that when Sagiev was found, he was wearing the metallic blue 'Sochi' jacket that he was last seen wearing. The jacket helped in locating his body in the rocky terrain, the park service reported.

There was no immediate word on the cause of death. An investigation is planned. 

It is unclear where in Russia Sagiev is from. His Facebook page says he's studying at the Higher School of Economics, which has its main campus in Moscow.
