Between the baking, stacking and frosting herself, one Queensland mother thought it would be a lot easier to order her two daughters’ shared birthday cupcakes off Facebook.

When Nicole Williams found a cake making and decorating ad through a classified section in Bundaberg, in Central Queensland, she was convinced that ‘Cup n Cakes by Ally’ would deliver what they had advertised.

But when the mother-of-three opened the box after the birthday dinner, her youngest daughter Kayla-Jaye, 4, was left in tears.

The 28-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that her cupcakes looked nothing like the photos advertised or described on the Facebook page. 

Nicole Williams made an order with Cup n Cakes by Ally, who promised the same Frozen design made by TheCakingGirl (pictured top) but when she opened the box, it looked nothing like she wanted (pictured bottom)

‘She had a lot of designs advertised so I told her that I wanted Pepper Pig ones and she said “I have no problems with doing that” and claimed she had previously made Pepper Pig cakes and even sent me photos to prove it,’ Ms Williams said.

Ms Williams agreed to pay $50 for two sets of cupcakes before they were made and she picked them up at the woman’s home, who lives just around the corner from her dad.

‘All I had to do was place the order through her page, pay for it and I didn’t have to queue in line through a bakery and flick through a lot of magazines to decide what I wanted.

Ms Williams said the lady even sent her a picture of her previous Pepper Pig cupcakes that she made but the ones she got was nothing like the photos

But when Ms Williams opened the boxes at a restaurant after the birthday dinner, she was outraged.

‘They looked gross – Kayla-Jaye wanted the Disney’s Frozen movie characters on her cupcakes but she started crying after she saw the face of the snowman,’ she said.

‘It didn’t look like a cuddly snowman. It looked more like it came out of a horror movie – it was really scary.

‘It was nothing like the pictures she had advertised and I’m pretty sure they weren’t baked that day because they tasted stale and dry.

‘It’s disappointing because my children were upset and I had to rush out and get new cupcakes, which only cost me $5.50 at a supermarket and they tasted delicious.’

Cody Brown, 20 and his partner Chloe Davis, 20, also had a similar experience when they ordered their cake through the same business

When Ms Williams asked for her money back, the woman claimed she had photo evidence of her children eating them.

‘I was really confused because I don’t have pictures of my kids eating them but she said I wasn’t entitled for a refund and started ignoring all my messages.’

Cody Brown, 20 and his partner Chloe Davis, 20, also had a similar experience when they ordered their cake through the same business.

‘Chloe spoke to the lady through Facebook and asked if she could make a dinosaur cake for our brother-in-law, Freedom Healey who is 21 and has a disability,’ Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia.

‘We even sent her a picture of what we wanted and the lady said she could make it.’

Random act of kindness: The couple was later approached by two strangers on Facebook, who offered to make the dinosaur cakes without charging

The couple was asked to pay $65 upfront but after the cake was ready to be picked up, the woman sent the couple a picture of what the cake looked like.

‘It looked disgusting and we didn’t want it.

‘But she refused to give us a refund and Chloe tried talking to her through Facebook and then she gave us two options – to take the cake or get a refund of $25.

‘Chloe posted the picture on the woman’s page so everyone could see what she was trying to do.

Another prime example of some global cake fails that has surfaced on social media. One baker attempted to make a Little Mermaid cake but found it was harder than it looked

‘All these other people started commenting and saying ‘that’s not right’ and eventually she showed up on Chloe’s mother’s front door and refunded all our money.

‘She was really rude to us and we had to go through a lot of trouble to get it back.

‘If you’re going to promise people, make sure you know how to make a cake properly.’

Not everyone can perfect the art of cake making. Another baker tried to make some Cookie Monster cupcakes

CAKE FAIL: Is this meant to be a melting yellow snowman with a raw carrot nose cake?

The couple was later approached by two strangers on Facebook, who offered to make the dinosaur cakes without charging.

‘It was a random act of kindness - These people went out of their way to make us two different dinosaur cakes after they had seen how disgusting the other cake looked. 

Cup n Cakes by Ally has since been removed from Facebook and Daily Mail Australia could not contact for any  comments.
