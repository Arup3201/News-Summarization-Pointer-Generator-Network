A brother and sister who spat in the face of a female bus driver walked free from court today after being ordered to complete a 'positive thinking' workbook.

Jason Fallas, 20, and his sister Chelsea, 21, swore at bus driver Ingrid Cumberbatch before spitting in her face as she tried to call 999.

Mrs Cumberbatch, 36, was forced to keep the spit on her face until police arrived so officers could swab it for DNA, a court was told.

The brother and sister walked free from court today, with Jason told to complete a 'positive thinking' workbook and Chelsea ordered to attend 'victim sympathy' meetings

The bus driver then had to undergo four hours of tests in A&E to determine whether she had contracted an infection, Llandudno Magistrates' heard.

The siblings admitted common assault and threatening behaviour during the incident on January 25 at Penrhyn Bay near Llandudno, Wales.

But the pair walked free from court after being ordered to go on 'victim empathy' sessions and complete a 'positive thinking' workbook.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said today: 'Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the independent judiciary.'

Ms Fallas was also given a 12-month community order while her brother given a four-month suspended sentence.

Prosecutor James Neary told the court Mrs 
Cumberbatch was driving her Arriva public bus from Rhyl, North Wales, 
when the siblings got on the bus.

Mr Neary said: 'During the journey 
Chelsea appeared to be speaking angrily on her mobile phone. After 10 
minutes the bus stopped for a while to keep to the timetable.

'Jason swore and threatened to tear up a paper the driver was holding and smash the bus up.

'He was shouting and screaming. After Mrs Cumberbatch told him to get off he spat on her cheek, his face contorted with rage.'

Mrs Cumberbatch, in a statement read to the court, said: 'Both got off the bus shouting and screaming. He came back again on the bus and spat again on my cheek.'

The court heard how Mrs Cumberbatch was left feeling 'incredibly dirty' after the incident.

She was told by police not to wipe the spittle off her face before they could take swabs for DNA.

She was then taken to A&E and was subjected to four hours of tests in case she contracted an infection from the pair's spit.

She told police nothing like this had ever happened to her in her six-year bus driving career and she was 'in disbelief' that people could behave that way.

Elen Parry, defending, said the brother and sister had been returning from a visit to their father who was seriously ill in hospital and they were 'stressed and emotional'.

She said 'red mist' had formed in their minds and they were now remorseful.

Court chairman John Mortimer told the pair: 'Your actions were disgraceful. This isn't the sort of behaviour we expect in a civilised society.'

Jason Fallas, of Llandudno, received a four months suspended jail term.

He was ordered to attend 'victim empathy' sessions, complete 100 hours unpaid work, pay £200 compensation and £165 costs.

Chelsea Fallas, also of Llandudno, was given a 'positive thinking' workbook to complete along with a twelve-month community order with 300 hours unpaid work. She must also pay £150 compensation and £145 costs.
