A family found an unwelcome surprise in their salad as they sat down to eat their dinner – a live two-inch locust.

Richard Loughton, 53, was dishing out the M&S Italian-style baby leaf salad to go with their pasta bake on Friday night when he noticed a ‘huge’ locust crawling around in the packet.

He pointed it out to his wife Helen, 51, and daughter Kate, 20, who were horrified.

Richard Loughton, 53, found a two-inch locust in a bag of Marks & Spencer Italian-style baby leaf salad, as he dished up dinner to his family

Kate, who is a healthcare assistant, said: ‘We managed to clip the bag shut but it kept crawling round inside it. I think because we opened the bag and gave it some oxygen it perked up and started munching on the lettuce. It was such a shock.’

Locusts are larger than 
grasshoppers and can be found in more than 60 countries.They are a 
farmer’s worst enemy because they descend in swarms and devastate crops.  

Helen read the packet, which said the salad was ‘produced in more than one country’. She said: ‘It could have come from anywhere.’

M&S have said the salad comes from their ‘trusted suppliers’ in Spain and Italy.

Kate added: ‘It really ruined our Friday night dinner. It was disgusting. I have no idea how it got in there without anybody noticing, it was huge, about two inches. You just don’t expect to open your salad and for there to be a locust inside.’

Richard, who is an engineer, purchased the salad from the Marylebone branch on his way home to High Wycombe from work.

The family rang M&S and asked what they should do with the locust and they were told to return the salad to their local store.

The locust was still alive and moving around inside the packet when Helen took the salad back the next day.

The family were given just £10 in compensation.

This is the second locust found in a packaged salad in just one month. A Waitrose customer also found a locust in her watercress, spinach and rocket salad at the beginning of April.

Kate said she’s going to be avoiding M&S salads for a while and checking what she eats very thoroughly.              

A spokeswoman for M&S said: ‘We’re very sorry to hear about the customer’s complaint. Quality is extremely important to us and we are working closely with our supplier to investigate the incident further.’
