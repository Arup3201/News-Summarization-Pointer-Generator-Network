Today 230 Ford Australia employees will work their last shifts at the car manufacturer's Geelong and Broadmeadows factories.

The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union confirmed exact numbers on Friday as Ford prepares to wind down its factory operations in Australia, planning an exit by 2016.

But it came as no surprise to the union with representatives telling MailOnline last week the cuts would be made at the Victorian factories.

On Friday, 230 employees will clock off for the last time at Ford's Victorian factories

AMWU national vehicles division secretary Dave Smith told AAP it was a 'tragic milestone' in the shuttering of Australia's automotive industry.

'Despite reducing the impact of its decision to lower vehicle production through a voluntary redundancy program and redeployment to other non-manufacturing areas, 230 workers are being shown the door against their will,' Mr Smith said.

'While the 230 Ford workers will be clocking off for the last time today, the impact will be felt right across the component and service supply sectors.'

This round of job cuts will see about 300 workers axed from the workforce, with 50 voluntary redundancies.

It will leave 450 workers at Broadmeadows and 350 at Geelong.

But Ford spokesman Wes Sherwood told AAP it was not over yet with job slashing to continue until the end of the year.

'As we have said all along, we expected the majority to be compulsory separations,' he said.

To help keep operations afloat, Ford has contributed $10 million to a federal government industry fund, and jobs fairs at its plants were attended by 30 potential employers.

It comes just over a year after Ford announced the two factories would close its doors in 2016.

Earlier this month AMWU representatives told MailOnline the job cuts were coming

Declines in sales of the Territory and Falcon are to blame for 230 forced redundancies and 50 voluntary redundancies

Earlier this month, regional secretary of the AMWU vehicle division Paul Difelice told MailOnline that Ford had attributed the cuts to slow vehicle sales in its Ford Territory and Falcon ranges.

'The Falcon is the one that has taken the most hits on the marketplace,' he said.

'There would have been around roughly 1,000 Ford Falcons sold this time last year and now it would be around the 690 figure.'

Ford's job losses come after Holden and Toyota announced in December and February respectively they would both cease Australian operations by 2017.

It follows six years of struggle for the auto industry since Mitsubishi closed its Adelaide plant in 2008.
