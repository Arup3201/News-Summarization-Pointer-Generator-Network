Baby bumps are nothing new in the Radford household.

But even though they are Britain’s biggest family, the sight of two together is a first.

When Sue Radford, 39, heard her eldest daughter Sophie, 20, was giving her a second grandchild she was thrilled.

Nine sons and seven daughters: Sue and Noel Radford are parents to Chris, 25, Sophie, 20, Chloe, 18, Jack, 17, Daniel, 15, Luke, 13, Millie, 12, Katie, 11, James, ten, Ellie, nine, Aimee, eight, Josh, seven, Max, five Tilly, four, Oscar, two, and Casper, one (not all pictured). Sophie is also mother to Daisy, one (far left)

Just a month later, the excitement was
 doubled when Mrs Radford discovered she was expecting her 17th baby – 
so now mother and daughter are sharing the pregnancy process.

The
 Radfords run a successful bakery and pride themselves on not claiming 
any extra state benefits aside from the regular child benefit. Mrs 
Radford, who has nine sons and seven daughters, said she was ‘ecstatic’ 
to find out she was pregnant.

She
 said sharing the experience with Sophie helps to stop her worrying 
about her own pregnancy after she suffered a miscarriage last September.
 Mrs Radford and husband Noel, 43, were ‘devastated beyond words’ when a
 12-week scan revealed the baby had died.

Yesterday,
 Mrs Radford said: ‘Baby No 17 is due in November and we couldn’t be 
happier. It has been fantastic being pregnant at the same time as 
Sophie.

Teamwork: The pair, who live in a nine-bedroom former care home, went for a scan together two weeks ago and they said they were both 'thrilled' to hear both babies are doing well

‘After everything we went through when we had a miscarriage, Sophie really helps to keep me calm.

‘I
 worried constantly during my last pregnancy but instead of doing the 
same this time, I just keep saying that what will be, will be. Because 
we are going through the same thing, we are able to talk about 
everything and reassure each other. It is great not to have to go 
through it all on your own.

‘We are craving all of the same things too, particularly junk food. We just laugh and say at least we will get fat together.’

Both pregnant: Mrs Radford said that sharing the experience with her daughter stops her worrying after she suffered a miscarriage last year

Sophie already has a 21-month-old girl called Daisy with her  22-year-old boyfriend Joe and they share a privately rented home.

She
 said: ‘It was strange. As soon as I found out I was pregnant I just 
knew my mum was too. When she told me I was so happy. It just makes 
everything less stressful and I feel like it has brought us even closer.
 It is lovely to be able to share this experience with my mum and we are
 both doing really well.’

A 
fortnight ago they even went for a scan together. Mrs Radford, whose 
family live in a nine-bedroom former care home near their bakery in 
Morecambe, Lancashire, said: ‘It was so lovely. Not many mums get to 
share that with their daughter so I knew it was really special. I feel 
like we have already made some amazing memories together.  Sophie knows 
she’s having a little girl and, although I don’t know for sure, I feel 
like I’m having a boy.

‘No matter how many scans you have it really is amazing to see a little life growing inside you.’

Incredibly,
 each day the family go through three loaves of bread, two boxes of 
cereal and 18 pints of milk, while an average supper can include 16 pork
 chops, 15lb of potatoes, three cabbages and 30 carrots.

Mr
 and Mrs Radford were childhood sweethearts and she got pregnant with 
their first child Chris, 25, at the age of just 14. Along with Chris and
 Sophie she is also mum to Chloe, 18; Jack, 17; Daniel, 15; Luke, 13; 
Millie, 12; Katie, 11; James, ten; Ellie, nine; Aimee, eight; Josh, 
seven; Max, five; Tilly, four; Oscar, two, and Casper, one.

The
 family were featured on Channel 4 show, 16 Kids and Counting. And will 
they stop counting at baby No 17? Mrs Radford said: ‘I always say “never
 say never” but maybe this time it is the last.'

House: The Radfords live in a £280,000 nine-bedroom former care home in Morecambe, Lancashire

Shoes: Each day the family eats three loaves of bread, two boxes of cereal and 18 pints of milk for breakfast
