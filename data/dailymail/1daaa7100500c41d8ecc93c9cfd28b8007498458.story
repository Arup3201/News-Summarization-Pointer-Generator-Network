The founder of a popular anti-sexism blog has spoken about her goal of making both men and women understand that sexism is unacceptable and must be talked about honestly and openly if it is to ever be stamped out.

Laura Bates, 26, is the London-based brains behind Everyday Sexism, the popular blog which publishes stories from men and women who have witnessed 'casual sexism' in action.

Speaking to the MailOnline, Bates said that she, like many women around the world, has been the victim of almost daily 'sexual objectification', from catcalls to bottom-pinching - and that it's time for people to realise that such actions are unacceptable, and in many cases illegal.

Grabbing, slapping or pinching a woman's bottom without her consent is sexual assault, despite what many people think

She said: 'Launching the blog was a combination of personal experience of everyday sexism and realising how common they were, and realising that I 
wasn't speaking up about them because they were so normal.

'In one week I 
was shouted at three times, so I started speaking to other women to see if they
 had similar experiences, and every single woman I approached had not one but hundreds.

'Street harassment, sexual harassment in the workplace... and not only were we altering our own behaviour to avoid it, we were being also told this wasn't an issue anymore, but clearly it is.'

People told Laura she was 'whining', and she realised a solution wasn't going to come about overnight. But she saw that if she was able to catalogue every woman's story in one place, disbelievers might begin to acknowledge the severity of the situation.

She added: 'Some of the stories are seriously shocking: schoolgirls as young as 11 being catcalled in the street, women being grabbed and manhandled by strangers, men driving up onto the pavement when a woman ignores his shouts.'

Laura said: 'If a girl had her bottom groped or breast stroked in a nightclub and then told her friends she'd been sexually assaulted, they¿d tell her to stop overreacting and being melodramatic'

Everyday Sexism catalogues vast 
numbers of stories from users with experiences similar to those of 'N', 
who writes: 'One day at school, when I was taking off my jacket to get 
ready for the lesson, the boy who sat at the desk behind me decided to 
reach forward and grab my breasts.

'I was only 13 years old at the time 
and was too shocked to do anything and didn't want to get told off by 
the teachers for making a fuss. Looking back I wish I'd done something 
though.'

Another user, 
Josie, writes: 'Overheard in trendy city bar at lunchtime - chap 
gestures nods woman at bar dressed in shorts and thick tights and says 
to his two friends, "and they wonder why they get raped".

'Well dressed, well spoken, the type you would want to introduce to your mother had you not caught this nasty little snippet.'

Bates outlines that under UK law being groped in a nightclub is sexual assault, but often neither the instigator nor victim realise this

Speaking to Anna Klassen of The Daily
 Beast, Bates outlines that under UK law being groped in a nightclub is 
sexual assault, but often neither the instigator nor victim realise 
this: 'The definition of sexual assault encompasses this [nightclub] 
experience.

'But if a girl had her bottom groped 
or breast stroked in a nightclub and then told her friends she'd been 
sexually assaulted, they’d tell her to stop overreacting and being 
melodramatic.'

'Again and again, 
people told me sexism is no longer a problem - that women are equal now,
 more or less, and if you can’t take a joke or take a compliment, then 
you need to stop being so 'frigid' and get a sense of humor.'

Everyday Sexism will celebrate its 
first birthday on 
16 April with nearly 25,000 entries, and Bates' plan is to now roll out 
the service internationally to 15 further countries and compare trends. 
The blog will also be made into a short film as part of the Gucci 
project, Chime For Change.

She said: 'What's great is that there's
 a huge sens of community and solidarity in the blog, with women telling
 me it's given them the strength and courage to report assault or call 
up colleagues for harrassment in the workplace. Women are able to share 
stories they were ashamed of before.'

The headteacher at a school I once worked at, said they should give the pill to every woman walking through the door, so they wouldn't get pregnant,' Michelle

'Refused entry to a gay club by door staff as I "don't look like a lesbian", being asked to prove it is a step too far,' Terri

'Followed home from bus by 5/6 men, whistling & calling out. Always wore flats not heels after that, in case I had to run,' Liz

'Found I was earning £40 a day less than a younger, less experienced and largely inept male colleague in exactly same role,' Rebecca

'Groped on holiday by the waiter after he gave me a free drink. My parents didn't realise and later asked me to tip the guy - I didn't have the courage to protest,' H
