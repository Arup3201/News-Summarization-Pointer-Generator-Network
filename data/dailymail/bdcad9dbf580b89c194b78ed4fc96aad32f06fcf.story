A huge increase in the number of rooms offered for tenants to share was reported today in London, as the capital's rental prices continue to rise.

A 71 per cent rise in room share searches has been reported by website Spare Room over the past two years - with two in five flat-sharers spending more than half their salary on rent.

Meanwhile Kangaroom, which helps people find a room in a house share, said 93,500 adverts were placed last year by people looking to share a bedroom - a rise of 48 per cent on the previous year.

Spare Room director Matt Hutchinson said: ‘Few people would choose to share a room, but the harsh reality is that London's housing crisis means rents are becoming increasingly unaffordable.

‘The demise of the living room and other communal spaces is another implication of the housing crisis - one in six shared homes now has no living room, compared to one in ten three years ago.'

An advert for one 'bright twin room' is being offered on the website in Maida Vale, west London, for an all-inclusive £259 a week - which is more than £1,100 per calendar month.

Suggesting reasons for the room sharing rise, Mr Hutchinson told MailOnline: ‘We don’t create huge amounts of work in areas where we used to build houses - around manufacturing and coal mining.

‘The scale that we would have to build on to change the UK’s property market would be a scale we haven’t built on since the 1970s. That is going to take time as there’s a lot of complex planning.

‘We need to look at how we use existing housing stock better. Just in England there are just between 15million to 20million unoccupied bedrooms in owner-occupied properties.’ 

Bedroom shares now make up more than 10 per cent of the market, according to Kangaroom founder Jinder Sidhu. He told The Guardian: ‘While rent prices in general rose by 7.5 per cent in 2014, room-share prices have decreased by 12 per cent due to increased supply and denser living conditions.’

The average monthly rent in London, which includes bedsits and shared flats, is now £1,418 - which is up 12 per cent in a year, compared to the national average of £867, it emerged last week.

But tenant reference processor HomeLet, which provided the figures, said that parts of Essex and south London have seen recent falls in rents thanks to ‘a relative boom in new property building’.
