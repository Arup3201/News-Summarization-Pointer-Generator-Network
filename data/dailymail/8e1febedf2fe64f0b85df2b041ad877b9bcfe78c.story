A damning leaked ECB document exposes Kevin Pietersen as a hypocrite and a divisive influence.

It also confirms the findings of a series of Sportsmail investigations into the controversial sacking of the England star.

Pietersen has used his new autobiography to portray a bullying culture in the England dressing room and has accused Matt Prior, Graeme Swann and Stuart Broad of being at the centre of it.  

A dossier of information on Kevin Pietersen put together by the ECB has been revealed

However, in the report, he is said to have described the very same dressing room during the first Ashes Test in November 2013 as ‘the best environment I’ve ever experienced’.

The dossier, which was leaked to the website ESPN Cricinfo, is a small section of a private first draft of a legal document that has been compiled in recent weeks by the ECB ahead of the publication of Pietersen’s book.

Yet even though it is far from the full story of the fall-out that led to Pietersen’s international demise, it is revealing enough to make a mockery of the maverick batsman’s side of a bitter and rancorous story.

Sportsmail revealed much of the content of the document both at the time of Pietersen’s sacking after the 5-0 Ashes humiliation and in the last few days but for the first time England fans can now chart on a day-by-day basis the behaviour that undermined captain Alastair Cook and coach Andy Flower.

The five-page section of the draft is marked STRICTLY PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL and reveals that:

In his book - and subsequent interviews - Pietersen states he was left crying and broken by a spoof Twitter account that parodied him. In a delicious irony, the leaked document reveals that Pietersen told his team-mates to ‘get a thicker skin’ when they complained about his friend Piers Morgan, who was making disparaging remarks about Cook on social media.

As revealed by Sportsmail at the time, Pietersen whistled insouciantly on his way back to the pavilion after his second-innings dismissal in the fifth Test. The document also claims that, after the game was lost, Pietersen walked out, saying ‘I don’t give a f***’.

It further alleges that Pietersen would pointedly look out of the window or at his watch while Flower was addressing the team.

Earlier on Tuesday, the 34-year-old rounded on his critics during a lively start to the extensive promotion of his autobiography, condemning Swann and then storming out on the BBC’s Jonathan Agnew when he tried to ask him about the text scandal that could have ended his England career.

Agnew, the BBC’s respected cricket correspondent, was brought in at the end of an interview on Radio 5 Live and was asked where Pietersen had gone wrong. Agnew brought up the derogatory texts sent by Pietersen to South African opponents about Andrew Strauss, a subject that he covered in an unsatisfactory manner in his book.

Instead of tackling that issue, Pietersen responded by again bringing up his hurt at the parody Twitter account @kpgenius that he claims was operated by the likes of Swann and Stuart Broad. Then he walked out without listening to Agnew’s reply. 

When asked earlier about the BlackBerry messages, which were uncovered by Sportsmail’s Lawrence Booth two years ago, Pietersen admitted regret at sending them but was again evasive about their content. ‘It’s something I regret because I got Andrew Strauss involved in a situation he should not have got into and I am sad that our relationship got a bit iffy after that.’

Upon receiving his 100th cap, Pietersen described the England dressing room in November 2013 as 'the best environment that I have ever experienced' only to then describe and deride a 'bullying' culture within the team

But what was in the texts? ‘I haven’t got a clue,’ he maintained. ‘There was a constant stream of messages and I know the theme was not complimentary towards Straussy because of the way he had been treating me.

‘The general feeling of the whole thing was that he was treating me badly. The South Africans picked up on it.’

Elsewhere during the interview by Adrian Chiles, Pietersen responded to Swann’s comment that his book was ‘a work of fiction’ by insisting that the retired spinner was at the heart of the bullying culture that he claims was rife in the England dressing room. 

Pietersen described Alastair Cook's captaincy of the England cricket team as 'weak' and 'tactically inept'

‘Swann is at the centre of this,’ said Pietersen. ‘I know that everything in this book I can stand by a hundred per cent. I put bullying into the perspective of the England dressing room, as to how certain individuals made others feel in that dressing room.

Pietersen did not dispute the dossier but said: 'It's a joke. I don't even want to give it any thought'

‘Jonathan Trott lost it in Bangladesh, he started screaming at Swann and Broad because they kept going at him. We’re supposed to be able to enjoy ourselves, not be scared to take a catch or field a ball.’

Pietersen, who was sacked in the aftermath of England’s 5-0 Ashes humiliation, again insisted that the alleged involvement of England players in the fake Twitter account was at the centre of his problems.

‘They can be funny if they are run by someone outside the dressing room making fun of you,’ said Pietersen of an account that Richard Bailey, a friend of Broad, admitted operating. ‘But when it is run from inside the dressing room, as I was led to believe, then it paints a very different picture. These are guys you go to battle with, these are guys you share the dressing room with for days and days, years and years, and then I get this feeling of total horror that I find out this is going on.’

Yet there is a strong feeling within English cricket that Pietersen is exaggerating the extent of his hurt at the parody, which the players strongly deny being involved in, to somehow excuse his texts about Strauss which came at the same time.

Pietersen did not dispute the contents of the dossier but said: ‘It’s embarrassing, they couldn’t even spell Cooky’s name right. It’s a joke. I don’t even want to give it any thought. I’m just getting on with my life.’
