Private CCTV systems may come under surveillance themselves, following a recent surge in complaints about spying neighbours.

Homeowners using security systems to protect their properties could be subjected to a new set of rules, following a report from the Government's surveillance camera commissioner.

Andrew Rennison warns that the growing trend of using private CCTV can cause ‘upset’ between neighbours where homeowners feel they are being watched.

I spy: Private CCTV users may need to follow new rules after surge in complaints of snooping neighbours

Although there are no current rules for private CCTV systems, the Coalition recently introduced a ‘surveillance code of practice’ for its public counterparts, particularly aimed at police and local authorities.

Ministers are also encouraging authorities to review whether the systems are ‘necessary, proportionate and effective,’ and to make information of the locations of security cameras available online.

New rules: Public CCTV are already under a 'code' and private systems might have to follow

In October Mr Rennison warned of a 'public backlash' unless proper steps were taken to regulate the more advanced camera technology used for CCTV.

‘The technology has overtaken our ability to regulate it,’ he said.

‘I’m convinced that if we don’t regulate it properly, there will be a huge public backlash. It is the Big Brother scenario playing out large.’

Today Whitehall sources told The Telegraph complaints about privacy relating to CCTV systems are becoming more common.

‘People put systems up for very good reasons,’ Mr Rennison said.

‘I will probably in the next year or so be publishing guidance to help people with that because although it is outside of the code of practice I think it is an area where people do want further advice.’

Mr Rennison urged private CCTV users to consider their neighbours when setting up their security systems, taking into account where the cameras are pointing so as to not cause upset.

‘I expect to receive complaints from people about inappropriate use of CCTV,’ he added.

‘But I suspect the highest number of complaints I receive will be from private users or people who have neighbours using private systems.’
