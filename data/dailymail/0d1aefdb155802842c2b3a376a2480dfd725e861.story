Wigan and Saints is a fierce rivalry befitting of Saturday evening’s Grand Final. It divides families, villages and, this year in particular, the staff room of St Edmund Arrowsmith High School in Ashton-in -Makerfield.

Just 200 metres over the border into Wigan from St Helens, its pupils come from both towns. On weeks like these, the split between supporters of the rugby league teams is accentuated and feelings at the school, known fondly as Eddies, are heightened by the presence of two of their former number on opposing sides.

Wigan’s brilliant young winger Joe Burgess and Saints’ robust forward Luke Thompson, both just 19, have earned their starting places in the biggest game of the year. It is just three years since they were classmates turning out in the same school team.

Headteacher Mark Dumican is a born-and-bred Wiganer. ‘The rivalry is incredibly fierce, it’s all-on even from school level,’ he said. ‘It’s in your blood, you get it knocked into you that whatever happens the rest of the year doesn’t matter as long as you beat St Helens. My best scenario will be for Joe and Luke to both play really well and Joe to score in the corner with 10 seconds to go.’

Incredibly, the last time Wigan and Saints met in the season- ending showpiece in 2010, Eddies again had a former pupil on each side with Darrell Goulding playing for Wigan and Jamie Foster for Saints.

John Griffin, head of rugby, proudly highlights the school’s wall of fame. Pictures of Burgess, Thompson, Goulding and Foster are displayed alongside recently retired England star Shaun Briscoe and Scotland’s John Duffy. Jane O’Donoghue, a former British tennis player who once faced Venus Williams in the first round of Wimbledon has her spot.

But in these parts nothing gets blood pumping like rugby league.

‘It’s a 60-40 split in favour of Wigan,’ Griffin informs me with a wry smile. ‘There’ll be plenty of friendly jibes and staff-room bragging rights are at stake.’

Griffin will take his seat in the executive box at Old Trafford as a guest of the Rugby Football League, in acknowledgment of his service to school rugby. ‘They always really stood out but for different reasons,’ he added, ‘Luke was quieter but always a big, strong lad. Joe has always been very quick but he’s grown four inches and put on five stone since joining Wigan.’

Barrie McDermott, a hall of famer turned pundit, identified Burgess and Thompson as players who would break through this season.

Burgess has made an instant impact with his speed and clarity of thinking — notably scoring the winning try in last week’s semi-final victory over Warrington. Thompson, meanwhile, has impressed in an injury-hit side.

It was Burgess’s dedication that most impressed PE teacher Sean Bradley. ‘We were playing our big rivals St Peter’s and Joe was really sick and off school. But I called his mum (Cath) and said, “We really need him,” so she brought him down. He was white as a sheet but he played well, we won, then he went back to his sick bed, poor lad. But that’s the mark of the man.’

Bradley, who has been goalkeeping coach at Wigan Athletic’s academy for nine years, considered putting Burgess in goal. ‘He was an all-round athlete, a runner and a footballer. He was over six foot, had great wingspan and handling skills, so could have been a goalkeeper. He could have been earning millions in the Premier League and he gets peanuts in comparison. But he had so much passion for rugby league.’

Jamie Foster (L) and Darrel Goulding also went to the same school as Burgess and Thompson and played on opposing sides of the 2010 Grand Final

Five miles down the road at amateur club Ince Rose Bridge, where Burgess played from seven to 16, when he then joined Wigan, he was often subject to mistaken identity.

‘A lot of people asked if he was another Burgess brother,’ said coach Chris Prescott, referring to the four brothers from Dewsbury who moved to Australia to ply their trade. ‘He was so talented, he’d score five tries a game and was hugely popular.’

He might not be a relative but Joe could soon be following his namesakes down under. Several NRL teams have shown interest in signing him and he could make the move as soon as next season.
