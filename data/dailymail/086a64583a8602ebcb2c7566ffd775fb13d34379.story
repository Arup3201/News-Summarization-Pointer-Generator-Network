And 
Parkhead sources have confirmed that the coach described as Norway’s 
answer to Jorgen Klopp is now the frontrunner to succeed Neil Lennon if 
compensation can be agreed with Stromdsgodset.

Deila delivered his current employers to their first Norwegian title in 43 years and won the Norwegian Cup in 2010.

Working
 under technical director Jostein Flo the former defender has emerged 
left-field candidate but has delivered success utilising the Celtic 
transfer model of fielding young, developing players and selling them on
 for high fees.

Deila is credited with developing Stefan Johansen, the midfielder who joined Celtic in a £1.5million deal last January.

Henrik
 Larsson, Roy Keane and Stevie Clarke have all been spoken to by 
Parkhead powerbrokers over the role vacated by Neil Lennon a fortnight 
ago.

However,
 a Celtic source told Sportsmail: ‘Ronny has been one of the main 
candidates from the start. He has turned Stromsgodset into Norwegian 
champions and was always one of the main targets.’

Deila is expected to comment on the Celtic link after leading his side in a cup game at Tromsdalen this evening, but Stromsgodset remain tight lipped on their manger's future.

'It’s
 always fun when there is speculation in the media about the players and
 coaches of Stromsgodset,' said the Norwegian club’s Chief Executive 
Erik Espeseth.

'It shows that we have arrived on the map of Europe. On behalf of the club it is flattering.

'But we have no comments in relation to any requests for our players or coaches.

'Generally
 speaking we think is it exciting and nice that they are being linked 
with major clubs in Europe. It says something that we have built the 
club over time.'

Norwegian
 media reports say Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell contacted 
Stromsgodset to express an interest in speaking to Deila on Tuesday 
night.

Deila’s
 agent Tore Pedersen took Stefan Johansen to Glasgow in January and was 
non committal on the latest reports of a new frontrunner in the race for
 the Parkhead hotseat saying: ‘It’s just speculation. I have seen many 
stories like this.

‘I speak with Celtic often. Partly because of Stefan Johansen. I was over there for the last game of the season.’

Deila
 stepped into the manager’s chair in 2008 after playing for the club and
 has improved their league position every year, culminating in the cup 
win four years ago and the title last season.

After winning the championship Stromsgodset moved to extend his contract until 2016.

Rosenborg
 and Swedish club Malmo have been linked with moves for the talented 
coach in the recent past, but Stromsgodset chairman Tom Saxegaard 
refused to comment saying: ‘You know for sure that we cannot comment on 
rumours'.
