World leaders and global celebrities flocked to the South African village of Qunu today to pay their final respects to Nelson Mandela.

Prince Charles, Oprah Winfrey and Richard Branson were among the mourners at the state funeral of the anti-apartheid icon, who died 10 days ago at the age of 95.

It was the second time this week that hundreds of well-known figures had gathered in honour of Mandela, after his memorial service at a Johannesburg football stadium on Tuesday.

Prince Charles, who described Mandela as the 'embodiment of courage and reconciliation' after his death, represented Britain at the state funeral.

Bill Clinton was also due to attend the ceremony, five days after he joined Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter at the star-studded memorial service.

The world of showbusiness was represented by actors Forrest Whitaker and Idris Elba, the British star who plays Mandela in a new film based on his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom.

David Cameron and other British leaders chose not to attend the funeral, having travelled to South Africa for the the memorial service.

However, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams did go to the ceremony, and yesterday he joined a guard of honour for Mandela at a celebration of his life hosted by the ruling ANC party.

Watching: Former French prime ministers Alain JuppÃ© and Lionel Jospin in the congregation

Prince Albert of Monaco and former French prime ministers Lionel Jospin and Alain JuppÃ© were also among the guests today.

The number of well-known people invited to the funeral has been a source of controversy, as a number of Qunu residents were barred from attending, instead watching the proceedings on a big screen erected nearby.

Mr Zuma was just one of many African leaders who travelled to the village, and he gave a eulogy in which he praised Mandela as a 'beacon of hope'.

'It is the end of an extraordinary journey that began 95 years ago,' he said. 'It is the end of 95 glorious years, of a freedom fighter, a dedicated and humble servant of the people of South Africa.

'Fountain of wisdom, a pillar of strength, and a beacon of hope for all those fighting for a just and equitable world order. Your long walk to freedom has ended in a physical sense - our own journey continues.'

Tribute: Mandela's granddaughter Nandi said 'Go well Madiba' as she delivered her eulogy

Coffin: Mandela's coffin was wrapped in a South African flag to mark his importance as a national leader

ANC deputy leader Cyril Ramaphosa, who was responsible for organising the proceedings, said: 'As we celebrate Madiba's life, we also remember important concepts that Madiba taught us - tolerance and forgiveness.'

Other African dignitaries at the service included Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and Zambia's first president Kenneth Kaunda, who gave an impromptu speech.

However, the most moving tributes to Mandela came from members of his family - granddaughter Nandi said: 'Go well Madiba. Go well to the land of our ancestors, you have ran your race.'

Don Dabula, the family chaplain, said that Mandela 'gave his life for the sake of justice and freedom, who lived the world healing practices of forgiveness and inclusivity, compassion and integrity'.

Chief Ngangomhlaba Matanzima added: 'A great tree has fallen, he is now going home to rest with his forefathers. We thank them for lending us such an icon.'
