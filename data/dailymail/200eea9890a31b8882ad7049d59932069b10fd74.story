The NYPD have released this sketch of a suspect they believe raped a 42-year-old mother in her bed while her daughter was beside her

A mother has been raped while she was in her bed with her seven-year-old daughter in New York city.

The 42-year-old woman told police that a man broke into her flat in Little Italy, Manhattan, at around 3.30am yesterday after climbing up the fire escape.

According to police reports the man flashed a knife at her before raping her, despite the fact that her toddler was sleeping by her side.

Police are now hunting for a suspect who they say was last seen wearing a black knitted hat, black leather jacket and black trousers.

They have also released CCTV footage that they believe to be of the attacker walking down Mulberry Street just before the attack.

According to reports the man was somehow able to get into a locked courtyard before scaling the fire escape and breaking into the apartment.

After the assault had taken place the man left through the front door of the property.

The woman was taken to hospital, but her daughter was not hurt, police said.

Elaine Dalessandro grew up nearby on Mulberry Street and has relatives in the building.Â 

Speaking to NBC New York she said: 'It's too close to home for me, I have a child and I live in this building. It's very scary.'

The news comes just days after a separate case where a woman was saved from being violently raped in the Willamsburg area of Brooklyn.

On Saturday at around 4.20am the 27-year-old was hurled to the ground by a man who then slammed her head into the pavement before trying to rape her.

The attack was only stopped when a passerby intervened in order to help her.

Police are still searching for a suspect described as a black male in his early 30s, standing between 5 feet 8 inches and 6 feet tall and weighing about 170 pounds. He had short hair and was clean shaven.
