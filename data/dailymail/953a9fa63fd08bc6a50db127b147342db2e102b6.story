Juan Mata has urged Manchester United to step up their bid for a top-four place, admitting it is hard watching their rivals play in the Champions League this season while Louis van Gaal’s side are excluded from Europe’s elite.

Mata moved to Old Trafford from Chelsea in a £37.1million deal a year ago this week but was unable to help his new club finish any higher than seventh after their disappointing season under David Moyes.

It meant that United missed out on Champions League football for the first time in 19 years, and their place in the top-four is once again under threat from a chasing pack after a run of two wins from their last six league games.

Mata warned that Van Gaal’s side are entering a decisive stage of the season as they prepare to meet bottom club Leicester City at Old Trafford on Saturday, and must go on a winning streak to avoid another season of frustration.

‘It’s difficult watching the games on TV every Tuesday and Wednesday,’ said the Spain midfielder. ‘It’s the thought that we all have in our minds that we need to be back in the Champions League.

‘It’s the most attractive competition in the world – we need to be there again.

‘This is our main objective for this season, to play Champions league football again because I think this club should always play in the Champions League.

‘It is going to be a fight until the end and not just between two teams. It will be between three, four, five teams, that we are now in a short difference of points.

‘We know we are arriving into a crucial moment for the season. The last months, the last 10 or 15 games probably, are the most important. We know we have to perform.

‘It’s very important, not just to win the games against your big rivals but also the weaker teams. If you want to be in the top four at the end of the season, you have to win almost every game. It doesn’t matter if it’s Leicester City or Manchester City. We have to go into the games trying to win.’

Asked why the goals have dried up in recent weeks, with United scoring just five times in their last six games in all competitions, Mata replied: ‘I don’t know why. I’m sure we will create chances again and I’m sure we will score goals again because we have very good strikers and very good midfielders. The chances will come for sure, hopefully this Saturday.

‘We’ve played very good football in some games, especially in November and December. We have to look back at how we did it and to do it again – because I think we can do it.

‘The way the manager wants to play is attractive for the fans and attractive for the players. I really like it. It’s just a matter of doing it how he wants.’

Mata has settled in among a growing number of Spanish speaking players at Old Trafford following United’s £150m transfer spending last summer.

He added: ‘Sunday was one year exactly. Obviously last season was not the best year in the history of the club but I’m very happy here.

‘I’ve scored some goals, I’ve assisted on with some goals. I’m looking forward to doing it more and more and trying to help the team get back to fighting for the title. This is what we have to do.’

The arrival of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera has increased the competition for places among United’s Gaalacticos. It has led to problems accommodating them all but Mata insists that he is happy with his playing time this season.

‘He is trying is to put the players in positions for the sake of the team,’ said the 26-year-old. ‘Obviously we have a lot of players and it’s difficult for him to figure out how to do it.

‘I guess it has to be difficult for the manager to choose from all the players we have, especially in attack. But I think it is also good for him because he has so many options.

‘He is experienced enough to handle it. For me personally, I feel very good and I’m just trying to help the team with my qualities.

‘I think you have to see it after the season has gone to see how many games I play, to see how important I was for the team. I feel important and I’ve played a lot of games so far so I’m happy.

‘There is a lot of competition for the first XI in the team, not just for me, so I’m happy that I’ve played a lot of games and I’m looking forward to playing more before the end of the season.’
