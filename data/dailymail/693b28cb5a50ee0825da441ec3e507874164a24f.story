It's happened to all of us.

Hours of a flight left to go and you're stuck next to a seat companion who doesn't quite understand the meaning of 'personal space.'

Thankfully, low-cost American airline, JetBlue, is here to help.

Low-cost American airline, JetBlue, asks, ' What's your Flight Etiquette?' in new campaign

Through the company's new #FlightEtiquette campaign, JetBlue hopes to inspire passengers to be more considerate of one another.

'The series stemmed from an insight that the things that happen to you while you're at the airport or in-flight is always a fun conversation topic among those who are passionate about travel,' Chan Tran, Brand Analyst for JetBlue Airways, explains.

'#FlightEtiquette is all about the situational behaviours that can occur between strangers during air travel.'

JetBlue hopes to inspire passengers to be more considerate by addressing common in-flight concerns

One of the most common concerns? How to exit your row to use the toilet when your seatmates are sleeping

She points out that while every airline tries to glamorise flying, very few provide a realistic, truthful perspective of what the experience is really like.

In this series of hilarious videos, JetBlue illustrates those uncomfortable moments that will inevitable arise while in close quarters with so many people for so long, including, how to handle those seat-hog sleepers and what to do when you really need to use the toilet but don't want to wake up your resting neighbour.

'Our approach is not only entertaining and humorous, it also says to our customers that we really get you,' Chan tells Skift.

JetBlue is here to help, with their handy 'How to Make an Exit' video - showing all of the things NOT to try

Using the hashtag #FlightEtiquette, JetBlue hopes customers will take up the conversation on social media

The series of videos is all about situational things that occur while in-flight - and how frustrating they can be

'We understand that on a plane, you're sometimes forced to rub elbows - literally - with people you don't know, and a little etiquette goes a long way.'

The campaign also calls upon those on Twitter to weigh in on what they would do in similarly awkward situations, hoping to create a dialogue among travelers.

'First and foremost, we want our audience to get the humour of the videos,' she adds.

As this actor shows, attempting to wake up your seatmate to go to the loo can be a serious challenge 

JetBlue insists the ads are over the top on purpose, but that there is always an underlying truth behind them

'They're over-the-top and exaggerated on purpose, and the actors we used are improv actors affiliated with New York's Upright Citizens Brigade.

'We also want our viewers to feel that they can totally relate or say that they've been in that situation before, and we hope to encourage engagement by having them tell us what they'd do in these awkward situations.

'In our Flight Etiquette videos, we're not telling people how to behave, but rather asking how you would react in these certain situations.'
