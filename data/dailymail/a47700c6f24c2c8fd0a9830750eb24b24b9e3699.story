This is the dramatic moment two of Ukraine's ousted leaders crashed through a metal detector and wrestled airport staff to the ground as they made a desperate attempt to flee the country.

Images shown on Ukrainian TV claim to show Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka, tax minister Oleksandr Klimenko and their bodyguards in chaotic tussles resembling an action film.

The pair, who were close allies of former president Viktor Vanukovych, were blocked from leaving the country in February after Ukraine's government collapsed amid violent protests.

Dramatic: CCTV images claim to show the moment two of Ukraine's top ousted leaders tried to flee the country. Several men are shown hurtling through a security scanner in Donetsk Airport, knocking it to the ground

Chaos: The escape bid was thwarted but Pshonka and Klimenko left the building after gunshots were fired  

Their bodyguards fired on border guards at Donetsk Airport when they were thwarted in their bid to escape, officials said at the time of the incident on February 22.

It was the same day Pshonka was ousted from the fast-collapsing regime with a vote of no confidence in Ukraine's parliament, as deadly clashes raged in the streets of the capital Kiev.

An arrest warrant was issued for Pshonka the next day.

In the images several men are seen hurtling through a security scanner in the airport's VIP lounge, knocking it to the ground.

At one point the man reported to be Pshonka, in a black overcoat with a distinctive shock of white hair, elbows a clutch of guards trapped in the fallen metal detector before scrambling over them and hurling open the door.

Interim prosecutor general Oleg Makhnytsky announced the details of the thwarted escape bid to the Ukrainian parliament.

'Measures have been taken to arrest Pshonka and Klimenko and initiate legal proceedings against them,' he said.

Ousted interior minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko and other colleagues were also reportedly seen at the same airport on the same day, he added.

Yanukovych himself was said to have tried to leave Donetsk aboard a private plane.

The former top politicians went on the run after leaving the airport building and their whereabouts are now unknown.

The footage was revealed by the Ukrainian TV station IHTEP on YouTube yesterday and has already been viewed around 500,000 times.

In the caption, State Border Service spokesman Sergey Astakhov was quoted as saying the pair escaped the airport building after their bodyguard shot at border staff.

'Protection of these citizens had physical resistance along the border, allowing them to leave the airport,' he said.

Days later Pshonka's opulent mansion near the capital Kiev was stormed by anti-government protesters who revealed it was filled with crystal chandeliers and plush golden furniture.

Opulent to the extreme, the lavish estate was just one of several extravagant homes inhabited by the country's former leaders and top officials.

The house in the village of Gorenichy outside Kiev was having its value assessed by experts after its owner went on the run.

However, it was only one of Pshonka's homes. He also had the use of a hunting lodge around 20 miles away on a compound with two other lodges, one of them for the use of the deposed president Viktor Yanukovych.

The hunting estate was also entered by opposition activists, who reportedly found guns and removed files.

The scale of the opulence of homes used by public officials is seen by opposition activists as proof of large-scale corruption among the country's elite, one of the key causes of public anger which led to the protests in Kiev and other cities.
