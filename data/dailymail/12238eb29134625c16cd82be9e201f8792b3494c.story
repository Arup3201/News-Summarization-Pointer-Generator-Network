Authorities stormed an arriving cargo ship believed to have Pakistani stowaways on board - some of which are reportedly dead.

The ship came in to New Jersey’s Port Newark this morning to waiting Port Authority police, Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and Coast Guard officials.

By midday Wednesday, all but one ambulance had quietly left the pier.

Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe said officials have inspected 150 of the 200 containers authorities believe could be carrying people.

At the ready: Authorities wait for the arriving cargo ship believed to have Pakistani stowaways on board

Alert: Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe said that crew members on the Ville D'Aquarius heard what sounded like people in a shipping container on the ship

Out in force: Police vehicles are parked at the entrance of the Port of Newark to investigate reports of stowaways in a container aboard the cargo ship

The New York Post reported that officials have also been using X-ray gear to examine the containers in question and are yet to find any stowaways.

The drama began early this morning when a routine inspection aboard the Ville D'Aquarius showed signs of what may be people in a container on the ship. 

Row told the Post: 'The
 boarding team went aboard for a routine inspection. They heard sounds 
that were consistent with people being inside a container.'

Coast Guard spokeswoman Michelle Krupa told the Star-Ledger: 'The officers were knocking on 
containers during a sound check, and they knocked on this one and they 
heard a knocking back.'

Customs and Border Patrol agents also met the vessel at the port.

Crews are now inspecting the shipping containers one-by-one as they are lifted off of the ship by huge mechanical cranes - a process that could take hours.

Search: Officials were seen scouring the ship's cargo containers one-by-one

Security: The ship's crew followed protocol by not opening the container believed to contain the stowaways in an effort to control the situation

The ship's manifest said the container in question was carrying machine parts to be unloaded in Norfolk, Virginia.

Rowe said the boarding party didn't open the container at sea in an effort to control the situation, following protocol.

A Coast Guard team boarded the 
850-foot-long vessel near the Verrazano Bridge outside New York Harbor at about 1am as the ship
 prepared to dock at Port Newark.

NBC New York reported that about 2,000 shipping containers are on board.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that officials are conducting a 'thorough investigation of the vessel.'

Inspection: Authorities were seen opening and checking the cargo containers as they were lifted off the cargo ship

Waiting: Numerous law enforcement vehicles, including ambulances were seen on the pier as the ship was investigated

Drew Barry, of the Sandy Hook Pilots Association, said he boarded the vessel at 5am, about 20 miles offshore.

Barry, who left the ship at around 9am, said he thought it would take several hours, if not much of the 
day, to get to the part of the ship, below the hatch cover, where 
officials heard banging noises.

He said: 'There are at least 30 to 40 containers on top of the hatch cover, and I don't know how many more below it.

Stowaway: Asem Haroon was detained after he claimed he had arrived in teh U.S. by stowing away on an Italian vessel

'If there are people down there, with no food and water for days, they're probably pretty desperate by now.'

Customs and Border Protection agents planned to open the container once it was unloaded.

Officials told NBC New York that harbours in and around the Empire State get about six stowaways each year.

The ship began its voyage May 30 in the United Arab Emirates, then made one stop in Pakistan and two stops in India.

Its last port before Newark was in Egypt on June 15.

The situation has raised security concerns over a possible new method for terrorists to infiltrate America's borders.

Last year, an Egyptian man found living in a New Jersey warehouse claimed he had arrived in the U.S. by stowing away on a ship to Port Newark.

The Post reported that the mysterious man, Asem Haroon, was suspected of fighting against U.S. troops in Iraq.

It's unclear how he managed to make the journey, or whether or not he came alone.

Port Newark is close to several oil refineries, a known al-Qaeda target.
