It was the story that had everyone paralysed with fear.

However, a group of spider specialists now claim the tale of the 'Bunbury Spiderman' belongs in nightmares, rather than real life.

Dylan Thomas, 21, was holidaying with friends last weekend when he woke up to find a strange red trail stretching up his stomach

Dr Volker Framenau, an Archaeologist, says: 'If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin'

Dylan Thomas was travelling in Bali earlier this month when he suffered from 'a really burning sensation like a searing feeling' in his stomach.

He claimed he sought medical attention, at which point a dermatologist removed a 'tropical spider' from his stomach with tweezers.

The Age have spoken with a number of local scientists who claim to have debunked the 'Bunbury Spiderman' story which went viral on Thursday, and was shared thousands of time around the world. 

Dr Volker Framenau, an Archaeologist from the Department of Terrestrial Zoology in Western Australia, said: 'If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin.'

Dr Framenau said it was much more likely the animal was mite, as some of these can resemble a spider.

He said if the creature had been collected, there would be less confusion as what it actually was, and would prevent the spread of a possible virus. 

Dr Mark Harvey, the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum, said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal

Dr Harvey said spiders would suffocate if they burrowed inside human skin: 'Spiders need air to breathe. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive'

Dr Mark Harvey says the fear of spiders fuels urban myths from people hoping to instil fear 

Dr Mark Harvey, the Senior Curator of Arachnology at the West Australian Museum, said he had never heard of spiders being able to survive beneath the skin of any mammal.

'Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive,' he told The Age.

Harvey said the fear most people have of spiders fuels urban myths from those hoping to instil fear.

It's not the first time spider fallacies has been debunked by science. Last month, Charles Griswold, a spider expert at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, said the popular myth that 'humans unwittingly swallow 8 spiders a year' was highly unlikely and unsupported by scientific evidence.
