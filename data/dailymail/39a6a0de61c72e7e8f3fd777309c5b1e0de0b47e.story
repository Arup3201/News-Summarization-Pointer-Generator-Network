On trial: Anxiang Du, 54, murdered a family of four with 'ruthless efficiency', a court heard

A businessman massacred a family of four in their home in revenge at losing a seven-year legal dispute, a court heard yesterday.

With ‘ruthless efficiency’, Anxiang Du repeatedly stabbed university lecturer Jifeng ‘Jeff’ Ding, 46, and his wife Helen, 47, in their kitchen, before moving upstairs where daughters Nancy, 18, and Alice, 12, were cowering in a bedroom.

The Dings had been former business partners with Chinese compatriot Du and his wife, but their relationship had soured, triggering a decade of legal action.

Du had travelled to the £350,000 property like ‘a man on a mission’, armed with a kitchen knife and out for revenge on a couple who had left him with court costs totalling £88,000, the jury heard.

The bloodbath unfolded on the day of the Royal Wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011.

The family were stabbed a total of 51 times.

A 999 call was made from Alice’s mobile phone that afternoon.

Prosecutor William Harbage QC warned the jury they would have to listen to the ‘distressing’ 20-second call, in which ‘more than one female scream could be heard’.

The court heard the catalyst for the horror was an injunction which had been served on Du, 54, the night before, preventing him from disposing of his assets. Mr Harbage said Du knew he ‘faced ruin’.

He added: ‘He resorted to violence, to murder in order to avenge himself of the people who had caused him such grief.

He did so not just by killing them – Mr and Mrs Ding – but also by murdering their wholly innocent daughters.

‘Mr Du made a plan and carried it out with ruthless efficiency.’

Mr Harbage said Du and his wife Can 
Chen, both herbal medicine practitioners, had run a string of successful
shops with the Dings until the relationship soured in 2001.

Du and his wife were dismissed from the business and in 2004 started legal proceedings against the ‘hard-working, decent’ Dings.

Seven years of civil litigation 
followed. Mr Harbage said that ‘although Du won the first battle, he 
lost the last’, and was left with the five-figure costs sum to pay.

Mr
Ding, who lectured in polymer science at Manchester Metropolitan 
University, was stabbed 23 times, while his wife, a translator, was 
knifed 13 times.

Their daughters – both talented violinists who toured 
Europe with the Northamptonshire Youth Orchestra – were stabbed a total 
of 15 times. Alice was found on the bed and Nancy was in a ‘prayer 
position’ on the bedroom floor.

All
four had been stabbed through the heart and lungs at the property in 
Wootton, Northampton. The jury heard Du’s fingerprints and other 
forensic evidence littered the bloody scene.

Following
the massacre, Du washed the knife and left it in the Dings’ sink before
escaping in their car.

The Dings’ bodies were discovered two days 
later. Du’s getaway car was found abandoned in London in May. 

He 
travelled by coach – under his own name and passport – to Paris, from 
there travelling to Spain where he took a boat to Morocco.

Sisters: Xing 'Nancy' (left), 18, and Alice (right), 12, were both killed in the attack in April 2011, the court heard

He was arrested there in July 2012 and extradited back to the UK earlier this year.

The
jury at Northampton Crown Court were told that Du, from Coventry, 
denies murder but does not deny that he carried out the attack.

He is 
expected to claim that he should be found guilty of manslaughter on the 
basis of either diminished responsibility or loss of control.

But
Mr Harbage said the premeditated, ‘grotesque killings’ were the 
‘clearest case of murder, with the obvious motive of revenge’.

He
told jurors: ‘This was a considered act of revenge executed in an 
unbelievably calm and cold-blooded manner.

'He (Du) planned to kill, he 
intended to kill, he did kill – four times. This is murder, nothing 
less.’ The case continues.

Scene: Du travelled in April 2011 to the family's house in Northampton (pictured) from his home in Coventry, via Birmingham, armed with a kitchen knife, the court heard

Home: Du killed the parents at their Northampton house before going upstairs to find their two daughters, Nancy and Alice, cowering in a bedroom, the court heard. He allegedly stabbed them to death as well
