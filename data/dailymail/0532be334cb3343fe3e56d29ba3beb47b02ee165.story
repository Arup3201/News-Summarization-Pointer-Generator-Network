From the elaborate turrets to the hidden room of reflection, it’s a painstakingly detailed tribute to a medieval castle.

But it seems Jools Holland was so engrossed in recreating the past that he forgot one very modern detail – planning permission.

Now the 55-year-old BBC presenter could be forced to tear down the structure, which he built in the seven-acre grounds of his country mansion near Rochester in Kent.

Holland bought the house, which is on the site of the 14th century Cooling Castle, 11 years ago. The ruins of the old castle still dominate the grounds, but evidently Holland wanted a new one, too.

So the musician built a two-storey walled structure to surround his swimming pool and his newly planted patriotic garden, laid out in the shape of a Union Flag. The walls contain a built-in parvis – a type of medieval room designed for quiet reflection.

Despite the size of the imposing  construction, he apparently did not realise that he needed to ask for planning permission.

The musician has now made a retrospective planning application to Medway council.

The application boasts of the wall’s ‘high standard of construction’ and use of local stone.

It reads: ‘The new wall and planters create a cohesive and attractive garden area viewable from the main house and the adjacent swimming pool and annexe.

‘Care has been taken to maintain the high standard of construction and detailing used elsewhere.

‘The wall itself has been constructed to match identically those already around the swimming pool, using natural local stone laid in lime mortar. The wall also has ‘crenellations’ along the top, which in a real castle would have been used by bowmen to fire arrows down on attackers.

The application continues: ‘At the west end of the wall, a set of steps leads up to a small room  sitting over a gateway that leads to the northern end of the garden.This room has no practical use but has been built as a visual feature using historic references.

‘As far as we have been able to establish, we think that such a structure is known as a parvis.’

A Medway council spokesman said: ‘The works that were carried out were undertaken by the owner on the assumption that planning permission was not required. He was subsequently advised that this was not correct and submitted a planning application.’

So far, no neighbours have objected to his plans.

Mr Holland is a well-known figure in the nearby village of Cooling and used its church for his 2005 wedding to long-term girlfriend Christabel McEwen.

Celebrities including Ringo Starr, Mick Hucknall, Lulu, Dawn French and Stephen Fry attended the ceremony.

Since buying the property, Mr Holland has added a music room, annexe and entrance hall to the manor house, as well as a large swimming pool.

A previous survey of the land, made when the swimming pool was built, said: ‘There was unlikely to be any archaeological remains of any significance in the area.’

Cooling Castle, which now consists only of four rough stone walls and a gatehouse, is on the ‘Heritage at Risk’ list of important listed buildings.

According to English Heritage, it is in a ‘very bad’ condition and in need of A-list priority attention.

Holland received an OBE in 2004 for services to the British music industry as a television presenter and musician. He is also a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent.

His wife is a member of a landed Scottish family and was formerly married to the Earl of Durham.

Holland formed his 20-piece Rhythm & Blues Orchestra after starting his own Big Band.

He has a weekly show on Radio 2, as well as hosting the television show Later... with Jools Holland. His annual Hootenanny has become a staple of New Year’s Eve television.

Last night Holland and his planning agent, architect Julian Bluck, were both unavailable to comment.
