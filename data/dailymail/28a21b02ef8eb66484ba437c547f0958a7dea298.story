This is the moment that a racist thug pushed a policewoman onto train tracks in a drunken rampage through a station.

Construction worker Kevin Pythian, 32, shoved the slightly-built woman officer onto the railway line as she bravely tried to restrain him in Oxford Road Station, Manchester.

Moments before he had accused a ticket inspector of being a member of Al-Qaeda and sprinted across the live tracks to get to the opposite platform. 

Pythian was jailed for two-and-a-half years at Minshull Street Crown Court after admitting a string of offences.

The court heard Pythian had been drinking in Manchester city centre when he walked into the station at around 8.55pm on February 17.

Northern Rail worker Narinder Singh asked to see his ticket he replied, 'I've got a ticket, I want to see your ID'.

When Mr Singh showed him his badge, Pythian said: 'I know you're Indian. I want to see your ID. As far as I know you could be Al-Qaeda.'

After being spoken to by supervisor Sean Lynch, Pythian staggered to Platform 4 but then ran across the track onto Platform 3 - causing an incoming train to break sharply.

He was then chased by the 36-year-old PC before a scuffle which resulted in her being thrown from the platform on to the track. 

The constable was knocked out and suffered a gash to the head, a broken finger and cuts and bruises. She remains off duty with her injuries.

Pythian went on to punch Mr Lynch and threaten to bite his ear off before running along tracks towards Deansgate.

Trains had to be halted for 11 minutes because of the incident.

Pythian had only recently been freed from prison, after being jailed for 10 years for an armed robbery at a north Wales supermarket in 2009.

Describing the attack on the slightly-built PC, prosecutor Barrie Darby said: 'He seemed to have calmed down and wiped his face but then he raised his hands and pushed her in the face with such force she went off the platform.'

For the defence, Graham Robinson said: 'Having assessed the CCTV and time to reflect, he is utterly remorseful for what he has done and totally ashamed of his behaviour.

Pythian, from Runcorn, Cheshire, pleaded guilty to two counts of assault, endangering rail safety and racial harassment.

Judge Geoffrey Lowe said: 'You could have stopped after each of these episodes. If you had things wouldn't be nearly as bad as they are for you now.'
