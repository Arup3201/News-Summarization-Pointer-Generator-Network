The Queensland home of international award winning designer Mark Gacesa is set to go under the hammer in a fortnight, hitting the market with high expectations.

Gacesa is the chief designer for Ultraspace, so it would come as no surprise that this property has been thoughtfully crafted to perfection to achieve the ultimate in modern, detailed glamour.

'I’m always creating original concepts that the client could never have imagined, but ultimately loves. I enjoy conjuring up innovative ideas with the use of new and exciting products and taking my clients on a journey with me that builds their excitement as we go,' he told The Interiors Addict.

'My extensive customisation affords my clients the opportunity to achieve their own incredibly unique signature look rather than mimic what’s been done (and overdone) before.'

175 Sawreys Road, Buderim is the first Ultraspace property to go under the hammer, with the 348 square meter home being described as 'like no other to hit the market'.

175 Sawreys Road, Buderim is the first Ultraspace property to go under the hammer, with the 348 square meter home being described as 'like no other to hit the market'.

Boasting four bedrooms and two bathrooms, this property is so more than simply a family home, it is 'a gift in architectural design and detail', according to the estate agent.

'We’re on two acres but it looks like 50 acres without a neighbour in sight. It’s still ahead of the curve even though I designed it ages ago and people are always stopping out the front to just look or take photos (the cheeky b*****ds)!,' said Gacesa.

The Buderim residence features a library with custom-designed fret panels, integrated gardens, mirrored ceilings and imported designer-pendant lighting, highlighted with seamless retractable doors. 

In the bedrooms, frameless full height mirror doors to wardrobes feature, with three rooms coming off the family wing.  

The kitchen boasts blue led lighting, concealed cabinets and a panoramic gas cooktop with illuminated and floating thermoformed Corian tops.

'The interior is mostly moody with injections of white to add contrast,' the international award-winning designer said

'I have a full DJ console in my living space that floats above a semicircle of artificial turf, which punches out through the stacker doors to become the daybed lounging space, along with a pool table area and large booth seating,' said Gacesa.

There is more to behold in the main living area, where a rotating suspended fireplace hovers over semi-circular feature turf with an illuminated custom alligator embossed leather media centre built-in.

Outside, sheer designer curtains cover walls of glass which encircle the al fresco deck. Featuring a built-in cocktail lounge with detail and mood lighting, the area is reminiscent of leading Hollywood bars. 

The master suite is a thing of beauty, with a floating chandelier, bronzed mirrors, and a woven sandstone and Corian bed head over cantilevered and integrated drawers.

The open ensuite features a customised water plane double vanity and in the bathroom a custom bronzed privacy fret panel is set.

'There are some awesome light fittings, fretwork paneling, loads of high end glass beaded and metallic wallpapers, some great art and heaps more features. It’s a showroom!' he said.

Next is an ensuite powder room, where European glass beaded wallpaper is embedded in various cuts of diamonds. Under-vanity piped sound and a custom walk-in creates an atmosphere of romance and exclusivity, featuring drawer banks, felt jewellery display shelves and pull-down hanging rails.
