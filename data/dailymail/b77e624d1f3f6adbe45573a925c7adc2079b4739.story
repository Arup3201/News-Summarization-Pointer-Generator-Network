The hunt for missing British girl 
Madeleine McCann has switched to the former Soviet Union after a 
confession from a serial paedophile that she could be in Russia or the 
Ukraine.

Serial 
paedophile Raymond Hewlett - who died three years ago from cancer - is believed to have told his son that he knew who had 
abducted Maddy from a Portugal holiday apartment in 2007.

A charity which specialises in finding trafficked children says it has been contacted by representatives of Madeleine's family to launch an appeal for information.

Posters in Russian with pictures of the youngster showing how she might look now are being distributed from the charity's offices in Kiev and Moscow.

Victoria Yanyko - from the Ukrainian Missing Persons Association - told local media: 'A representative of the family contacted us and we made a special, Russian language, leaflet to spread with the intention of finding this girl who went missing six years ago at the age of four.'

'We've distributed it in the Ukraine and in Russia, thanks to our Russian colleagues.

'A representative of the family contacted us after they got information from a dying man who said he took part in abducting Maddy and that she might be in this area,' she added.

Russian news website Life.ru says the new search was triggered by a call from Graham Perry, a volunteer with the Find Madeleine campaign.

'It is possible that Maddy now holds another name and speaks another language,' he told Life.ru.

Determined: Her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured) have led a high-profile worldwide search for their daughter since she went missing

Madeleine was nearly four when 
she vanished from her family's Portuguese holiday apartment in Praia da 
Luz as her parents, Gerry and Kate, ate dinner at a nearby tapas 
restaurant with friends.

The
case led to a worldwide search amidst fears the girl had been snatched,
but despite a number of leads coming to light no trace of Madeleine has
every been conclusively found.

Since
the disappearance, officials have from time to time issued digitally 
altered images showing what she might look like over the passage of 
time.

Madeleine's 
family have never given up their quest to track down their missing 
daughter.

Mrs McCann has ploughed £1million from sales of her book about the incident and its aftermath back into the search.

The bestseller, entitled simply Madeleine, was published in 2011 on the day of her eighth birthday.

Madeleine's Fund hit £1.8million shortly after the three-year-old vanished from her family’s holiday resort.

But by 2011, after four years of searching, it had dwindled to £125,000.

There have been a number of reported sightings of Madeleine from across the world since she went missing.

In 2011 the Chandigarh Tribune said that a 
British woman had seen a youngster bearing a remarkable likeness to 
the youngster.

But after studying a photo of the child, the McCanns announced the girl was not  their daughter.

More recently, DNA tests confirmed that a girl 
mistakenly identified in New Zealand as being Maddy was not the missing youngster.

Police launched a five-day investigation in January when a Queenstown retailer became suspicious of a man and the young girl.

The 'sighting' on New Year's Eve was the second time the girl was mistaken for Madeleine last year, the other being in March.
