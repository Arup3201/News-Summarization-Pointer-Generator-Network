A travel writer has spent the past year flying across America for free, by hitching lifts with pilots.

Jet hiker Amber Nolan, 29, from New York, has seen 42 American states and more than 250 towns and cities on her journey, made possible by the kind nature of pilots she has encountered on her way.

Amber said: 'As a travel writer, I've been all over the world but I hadn't seen much in my own backyard. I wanted to experience the United States in a unique way and started brainstorming ideas.'

Amber combined her love of travel with an aim to raise awareness about the aviation community outside of commercial airlines, and has been hitching lifts across America since July 2012.

But the process of getting the flights isn't an easy one.

She added: 'I spend hours and hours contacting people. I'll go to the airports and tell people what I am doing and wait around - and sometimes it is days before I find someone heading the direction I am.'

When she finds a pilot going her way, she relies upon the good nature of the pilots in the community to get her from place to place.

She said: 'The pilots have an adventurous spirit as well, and many of them have hitchhiking stories of their own 'back in the day.'

The other thing is that they love introducing people to aviation. It is their hobby and their passion so if they can show others a different side of aviation beyond the commercial airlines they jump at the chance.

'One pilot told me he asks everyone around the office if they want to go flying with him - it creates a reason for them to go and might spark an interest in aviation with someone.'

Amber has been travelling non-stop since 2012, apart from a few exceptions where she has run out of money and has found a job where she has landed.

She said: 'This adventure is almost complete. I have eight more states to go before the next adventure begins.

Ambitious Amber said: 'I've considered taking JetHiking global, by expanding to Canada, Australia, the Caribbean, and Europe.

'However, I would like to get my pilot's licence first and take some time to plan and save money for such an undertaking.

'In America, we have a long history with airplanes and a general love for flying within the community so it was a natural place for JetHiking to take off.

'Regulations and fewer pilot numbers will make it more difficult elsewhere, but I think it is still possible. There's a huge world out there, and I don't plan on staying still.

'I think an organised ride-share system between pilots and travellers to cut costs on both ends could make this a reasonable option for travellers with a limited amount of time.

'I definitely recommend visiting a local airport or flying club and seeing what the general aviation side is all about.'
