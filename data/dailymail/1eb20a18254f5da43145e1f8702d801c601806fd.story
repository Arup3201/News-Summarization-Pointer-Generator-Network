They were derided by opposing fans for not winning a trophy in nine years, now two have come along in a matter of months but you wouldn't have guessed judging by the faces of some Arsenal players.

The Gunners squad were out in London on Sunday night 'celebrating' their 3-0 Community Shield success against Manchester City at the Novikov Bar in Mayfair.

Rather than being pictures of happiness after the Wembley win, the FA Cup holders looked more downbeat.

New signing Alexis Sanchez was involved in the rather muted celebrations after marking his competitive debut with a 45-minute flurry of pace and skill against City at Wembley.

In tow with the £30million Chile star and his girlfriend Laia Grassi were England duo Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, as well as goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny and his girlfriend Marina Luczenko.

Mikel Arteta, who was recently appointed as Arsenal's new club captain following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona, also attended the celebrations with his wife Lorena Bernal.

Arsene Wenger's side start their Premier League campaign at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday.
