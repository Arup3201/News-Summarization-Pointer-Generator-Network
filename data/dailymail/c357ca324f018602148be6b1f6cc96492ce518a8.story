A young Boston University student was killed in a house fire over the weekend, the latest in an alarming series of deaths reported in the school community since April of last year.

Binland Lee, a 22-year-old senior from 
Brooklyn, New York, was killed over the weekend in a massive blaze at 
her off-campus apartment.

Boston fire officials said that 15 others, including six firefighters, were injured on Sunday morning at a 2-1/2-story wood frame house in the Allston neighborhood.

She is the 11th BU student fatality to be reported in 13 months.

Miss Lee's death came just two weeks after 23-year-old Lu Lingzi, a grad student at BU, perished in the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15 - one of three deaths reported in the horrific blasts.

Miss Lu had aced her qualifying exams in the days before the historic race.

The senseless deaths of the women have rocked the Boston University community - and for many, they are the latest in a long line of fatalities in anything from accidents to shootings to suicides.

Trend: At least 11 Boston University students have died in the past 13 months

Emily Overholt, the editor-in-chief of BU's student newspaper - the Daily Free Press - told ABC News: 'We get them in these little clusters. It's hard, because it's really catching up to people.'

She added: 'It's one thing after another.'

BU President Robert A. Brown told the Boston Globe that he too is coming to grips with the student deaths.

He told the paper: 'There’s a sadness because you see people come here with so much aspiration. To have what look like sets of random tragedies, you’d like to analyze each one and figure out why it happened... It's just so senseless.'

A town hall style meeting regarding the recent university tragedies was held on Monday.

Last month, freshman Anthony Barksdale II was found unconscious at an off campus apartment where a BU fraternity was holding an event.

Mr Barksdale was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

His death resulted in the suspension of the fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu, BU Today reported.

Communications student Christopher Weigl, an avid photographer and cyclist, was killed in December when he was hit by a tractor-trailer while riding his bike.

Weigl's death came just a month after another cyclist, Chung-Wei 'Victor' Yang, died after he was struck by an MBTA bus at the Harvard and Brighton Avenues intersection.

Chad DiGregorio, a BU grad student doing archaeology research in Turkey, was killed on July 19, 2012 after he went out alone and fell in a rugged area of the country, according to BU Today.

In May of last year, three BU students studying abroad in New Zealand were killed when the minivan they were riding in went off the road and crashed.

Daniela Lekhno, 20, of Manalapan, New Jersey; Roch Jauberty, 21, whose parents live in Paris; and Austin Brashears, 21, of Huntington Beach, California, were pronounced dead at the scene.

Another five students were injured.

Kevin Taylor, a police official, told the Associated Press it was not clear why the van drifted to the side of the road.

He said some of the students were thrown from the vehicle, indicating they may not have been wearing seat belts.

Kanagala Seshadri Rao, 24, was shot to death on April 19, 2012 just outside of his off-campus apartment in Allston.

No arrests have been made in the case.

Ten days earlier, pharmacology student Carolyn Brown, 25, killed herself in her South End apartment by ingesting a toxic chemical, the first incident in the disturbing trend.
