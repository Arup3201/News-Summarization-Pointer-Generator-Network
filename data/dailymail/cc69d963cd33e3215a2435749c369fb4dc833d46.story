Grieving widow Jamie Schare Friedland buried her husband on Wednesday just days after he was fatally shot in front of her during a 
carjacking at an upscale New Jersey mall on Sunday.

Dustin Friedland's funeral was held at the Beth Am Shalom synagogue, near where he had grown up in Lakewood, New Jersey.

In front of hundreds of mourners, 27-year-old Jamie said she could not have asked for a better and more loving husband.

Dressed in black, she spoke for almost 
ten minutes during which her voice broke several times and she had to 
stop and compose herself.

Dustin Friedland was remembered at Wednesday's funeral as a man full of integrity and chivalry, who insisted on carrying packages and heavy things for others - whose final act had been to open the car door for his wife

She remembered Dustin, 30, as a man full of 
integrity and 
chivalry, who always insisted on carrying packages and heavy things for 
her.

‘Dustin was the most chivalrous 
person. He would run to make sure he opened for car door for me. There 
wasn’t a bag anyone ever carried that Dustin didn’t help with.’

‘Dustin always did the right thing,’ she added.

Tthe last of six speakers during the service, Jamie
 told mourners that despite her loss, ‘I’m truly the 
luckiest person I know, and I still believe that because I married the 
best man in the entire world.’

‘I was lucky enough to be with him in the time we had,’ she said. The couple, who married in 2011,  had been hoping to start a family before the tragic incident.

‘There
 was not a better person, a better soul, in the entire world. He was my 
entire world and my happiness was the most important thing to him, 
always.’

‘He was kind, generous, giving, smart, loving, loyal, just the best person you ever met,’ she added.

‘Dustin, I love you more than anything in the entire multiverse,’ she said, standing just feet from the closed casket.

‘You are my everything, my hero. And I’m so proud to have known you, loved you and married you.’

The other eulogies were delivered by Dustin’s two siblings Daniel and Deanna, Jamie’s mom, Agnes Schare, a cousin and his best friend, Jospeh Cermatori.

Dustin's younger brother, Daniel told Jamie that he'd 'never seen anyone bring a bigger smile to my brother's face than you.'

He also called his brother 'the most giving person.'

'May God always keep you safe, Dustin,' he said. 'I will miss you and carry you with me forever.'

Earlier Jamie had stood outside the synagogue sobbing and hugging mourners as they arrived. When it was time for the service to start, she said: ‘I can’t go in there. I can’t go in there.’

A friend had had to help coax the distraught widow inside.

The couple had met while both law students at Syracuse University.

During the service, Jamie recalled how Dustin - who was two years above her - would regularly drive through snowstorms to visit her every other weekend after he graduated.

‘There was nothing that was going to stop him from seeing me, ever,’ she said.

When
 the couple had a pre-wedding meeting with the rabbi who would marry 
them, the rabbi told them that once wed, they would become 'one person,'
 said Jamie.

Her husband took that view to heart, often
 reminding her that 'we are one person' and that he would always be by 
her side.

'He wasn't here (with
 us) long enough, but he did so much while he was,' she said while 
fighting tears and tightly gripping the lectern. 'I was lucky to be with
 him for his forever.'

Dustin was shot in the head on Sunday night in front of his wife in the parking 
garage of The Mall At Short Hills, about 10 miles west of Newark, after 
being confronted by two carjackers. 

According to authorities, he apparently resisted handing over the keys to his silver 2012 Range Rover.

The suspects, who are believed to be black men in their 20s, fled separately in the Friedlands’ $80,000 vehicle and a green Subaru SUV.

Their car was 
discovered the next morning in Newark. A reward of more than $40,000 has
 been offered for information leading to the arrest of the killers.

Many
 in the standing-room-only crowd wept during the 90-minute service at 
Beth Am Shalom synagogue, which is near the New Jersey shore community 
where Friedland grew up.

He went on to get a law degree and went to work
 as a project manager for his family's heating and air conditioning 
business while living in Hoboken, a city on the Hudson River that is 
popular with young professionals.

The
 mourners heard Friedland's wife, his younger siblings and others recall
 him as man of integrity, a person whose ethics and values were never 
muddled. They joked about his warmth, his fondness for food, family and 
friends and his chivalry.

He opened the car door for his wife, they said, just moments before the carjackers confronted him.
