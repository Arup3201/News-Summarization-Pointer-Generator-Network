After their high street's Christmas tree was dubbed the worst in Britain, residents of Stockton Town Centre were left feeling a little less festive than others.

So, in a bid to restore the community's Christmas spirit, a local pub landlord decided to put up his own fir near the council's effort, which has been likened to 'an upside down cornet'.

But within hours of erecting the improved tree, council officials were on site to tear it down after branding it a 'health and safety hazard.'

Pub landlord Craig Harker worked tirelessly with local children to put up the tree outside his pub in Stockton

Craig Harker was left mortified by the attention the town's tree had received, with some critics slamming it as a 'disgrace'.

With the help of some local children, the 26-year-old decided to put up a real Christmas fir, complete with tinsel, baubles and beads.

The 26-year-old was among countless residents who were left red-faced by the council's effort

But despite being admired by customers at The George Pub, the tree was swiftly taken away on the back of  a JCB by council workers who deemed it 'dangerous'.

Mr Harker said: 'A bar worker saw the council workers driving away with the tree and she called me.

'She was too late to do anything about it, as they were already leaving when she saw them.'

Though the pub was open at the time, Mr Harker claims no one bothered to tell staff the tree was to be removed.

'When I rang the council I was told that it had blown over and that it was a health and safety hazard,' he added.

The landlord wasn't the only local resident who was left red-faced by the council's 'tree' which was likened to a dunce's hat and wigwam by passers-by.

'It's not good for the town to get such publicity, I wanted to do something positive.

'I am devastated, I don't understand why they could not have just spoken to me about it.'

'It meant a lot to me, I was running round trying to sort out the buying of the tree while by partner was in hospital with our newborn baby.'

Mr Harker has even offered to gift the tree to the council so they can put it back up, but is waiting for a response. 

Stockton Council has said it received a report that the tree had blown over - and that workers took it away on Monday morning 'while making efforts to establish who owns it.'

The council has since tweeted that it is talking to Mr Harker, but did not indicate whether the tree would be reinstated.

All that remains: Craig Harker is 'devastated' that the council removed his Christmas tree

Councillor Bob Cook, Leader of Stockton Council, said: 'The tree was blown over during the early hours, narrowly missing a passer-by.

'Thankfully nobody was injured but I think the CCTV footage speaks for itself really – this is not a case of the council overreacting, more a case of being sensible in light of the windy conditions.

'Our staff recovered the tree after a report that it had been propped up against a barrier.'

'Embarrassment': Residents were horrified by the council's white, cone-shaped Christmas tree

Stockton Council was not available for a comment this evening.

Last week the town's tree was lambasted as the country's worst, with critics comparing it to an upside down cornet and dunce's hat.

Local residents were dismayed by the effort, with some saying they would take their children and grandchildren elsewhere to see the Christmas lights being switched on.
