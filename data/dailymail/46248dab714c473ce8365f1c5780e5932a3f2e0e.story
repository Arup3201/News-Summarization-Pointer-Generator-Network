The husband of the late Lisa Flynt-Fugate, the daughter of controversial Hustler publisher Larry Flynt who died recently after a car crash, has accused an unnamed family member of stealing three golden eggs that belonged to his wife. 

Glen Fugate called the police to his home in Dayton, Ohio, on Friday to investigate the theft of the eggs, valued at $2,000 each

Fugate told police that he believes one of sister-in-laws took the valued possessions while she was helping his mother-in-law Amanda Carson move out of the home.

According to the police report, Fugate said he saw the unnamed sister remove the items from his wife’s glass display shelf.

Fugate said he told the relative to put the eggs back and she did, but later he noticed that the eggs were again missing from the display.

The sister denies taking the eggs.

‘It could have easily been one of the several family and friends that were in the house’ she told the cops when interviewed.

Fugate has said he won’t press charges if the eggs are returned to him.

Flynt-Fugate, 47, suffered critical injuries in an October 17 car crash and died seven days later after she was removed from life support

Flynt-Fugate had seven siblings - Tammy Carson, John (Nicole) Carson, Tonya Flynt, Kim Carson, Theresa Flynt, Ray (Rory) Carson, and Larry Flynt Jr plus six children of her own.

Aged 47, she suffered critical injuries in an October 17 car crash.

Flynt had left a local bar with 24-year-old friend Cierra Mallory before 5pm when she swerved in front of a semitrailer and rolled her Oldsmobile on Valley Pike in Riverside.

The Huber Heights resident was ejected from the vehicle in the crash, and rushed to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton.

She was put on life-support but succumbed to her injuries after she was removed from life support seven days later on October 24

Her father, Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, was on the phone with family at the hospital at the time of Lisa’s passing.

Flynt Sr, 71, is the publisher of Hustler and the chairman of a large adult entertainment empire. He is best known for being part of the landmark Supreme Court Case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell.

Flynt's magazine was sued by Evangelist Jerry Falwell after they published an ad which joked about the first time Falwell had sex.

Falwell tried suing the magazine, but the Supreme Court ruled that since he was a famous person, he couldn't receive damages for emotional distress - strengthening the First Amendment right to free speech.

The story about the infamous legal battle was turned into a movie called The People vs. Larry Flynt, starring Woody Harrelson as the pornographer.
