One of the world’s largest airlines is reportedly looking at cramming more seats onto a new subfleet of Boeing 777 aircraft, meaning its economy class passengers would have even less space than before.

A high-density configuration would see United Airlines install up to 364 seats on each retrofitted plane, almost 100 more than it currently has on many of its three-class 777s, Aviation Week reported.

The Chicago-based carrier would add a seat to every row in economy – bringing the total to ten per row – and shrink the size of its business class while leaving its premium economy class untouched with nine seats per row.

Aviation Week spoke to an anonymous source and quoted airline documents that reveal a proposal to have 28 seats in business class, 98 in premium economy and 238 in economy on some aircraft.

It did not say how many planes would be retrofitted, but added that many new 777s built by Boeing have 10 seats per row in economy.

Under that configuration the middle section has four or five seats in each row while each outside section has two or three seats.

A United Airlines spokesman declined to comment on the report.

He told MailOnline Travel: ‘We evaluate lots of options across our fleet and haven’t made any further announcements specific to the 777 fleet.’

According to United’s website it has four versions of the Boeing 777-200.

Two versions fly between the US and Europe with eight seats in first class, 40 in business, 110 or 113 in economy plus, and 108 in economy for a total of 266 or 269.

A third version seats 50 in business, 72 in premium economy, and 145 in economy (267 in total)

The fourth version flies to Hawaii, carrying 32 in first class, 98 in premium economy and 214 in economy (344 total passengers).

The seat pitch (the space between seats) on all of United’s Boeing 777s is 32in while the seat width is 18in or 18.3in.

Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, said if United changes its configuration to ten abreast in economy it will likely do so on routes where it doesn’t have a lot of traffic in its pricier business class.

He said: ‘If there’s not a lot of high-revenue business it allows (an airline) to obviously drive additional revenue by getting more bums in the seats in economy at a price that people are more willing to pay.’

He said the seat pitch isn’t likely to change when an airline goes from nine seats in a row to ten, but the seat width will shrink.

‘If you can cope with a narrower seat, and many people can, it probably won’t make a huge amount of difference.’

Air France, American Airlines, Emirates, Etihad and Japan Airlines are among the carriers which currently have ten seats per row on all or some of their Boeing 777s.

When an airline adds a seat to every row in economy it doesn’t necessarily translate into cheaper fares for consumers, said Mr Atkinson.
