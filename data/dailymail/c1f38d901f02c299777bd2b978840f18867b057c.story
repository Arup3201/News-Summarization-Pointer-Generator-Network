Attorney General Eric Holder suggested Friday that the Obama administration's opponents have in part staked out their positions because he and the president are black.

'There have been times when I thought that’s at least a piece of it,' he said.

But it's 'hard to look into people’s minds, you know, their hearts.'

The graceless exit interview will become grist for conservatives who remain convinced that Holder has used race issues to deflect attention from legitimate criticisms.

A Politico reporter pressed Holder on whether the White House's detractors were motivated by racial animus, declaring that they were 'more than (on the) fringe.'

Outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder suggested America is still cowardly on race – especially Republicans

Conservatives, the outgoing attorney general said, 'use a whole variety of things' to go after the African-American presdient and his top law enforcer.

'You know, "You weren’t born in this country, you are the 'other'",' he parroted.

'I mean, you come up with other – you come up with ways in which you try to be effective in your attacks.'

'And certain people have been, you know, less sensitive than they should have been to understand that certain things, given our history,' he said, seemingly invoking America's history of slavery from more than 150 years ago.

'There are certain places that you just shouldn’t – you shouldn’t go.'

Holder famously said just days after assuming his office in February 2009 that American had been 'a nation of cowards' on race.

'Race-related issues,' he claimed in a speech, 'continue to occupy a significant portion of our political discussion.'

On his way out of the Justice Department, Holder said he would soon call for a change in the standard of proof the agency uses when deciding whether it can prosecute Americans in cases where civil rights abuses are alleged.

He plans to make a move before his successor, New York federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch, moves into his office. 

The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Lynch yesterday, with three Republicans crossing the aisle to vote for her. A full Senate vote will come soon.

Changing the civil-rights prosecution standard would make it easier for the DOJ to prosecute Americans like George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed the unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in 2012.

The Obama administration announced this week that it won't move forward on that case since it had 'insufficient evidence to pursue federal criminal civil rights charges.'

Holder seemed to regret that outcome.

'I think some serious consideration needs to be given to the standard of proof that has to be met before federal involvement is appropriate, and that’s something that I am going to be talking about before I leave office,' he said. 

'I think that if we adjust those standards, we can make the federal government a better backstop – make us more a part of the process in an appropriate way to reassure the American people that decisions are made by people who are really disintereste' in the outcome.
