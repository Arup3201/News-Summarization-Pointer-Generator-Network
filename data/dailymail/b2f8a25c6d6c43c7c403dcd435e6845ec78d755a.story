A record 54 per cent of families are now using discount stores – and high street prices are showing ‘historic’ falls as a result.

The surge of budget chains such as Aldi, Lidl and Poundland, plus cheap fashion outlets including Primark, is delivering the biggest change in shopping habits since the 1950s.

Industry figures show the average price across 500 of the most commonly bought products fell by 1.8 per cent in September.

The price of non-food items was down by an average of 3.2 per cent with particularly big falls for fashion, shoes and electrical items.

Clothes were 10.2 per cent cheaper than a year ago, largely because retailers were forced to slash the cost of autumn coats and jumpers which did not sell because of the unusually warm weather.

The figures come from the British Retail Consortium, which said food prices showed a modest annual increase of 0.3 per cent – the lowest level since the BRC launched its Shop Price Index in 2006.

The cost of putting meals on the table has been tamed by a price war – triggered by the rise of Aldi and Lidl – forcing mainstream supermarkets to cut the cost of essentials.

Discount supermarket chains such as Aldi are eating into the profits of the 'big four' supermarkets

Market shares figures this year showed large growth for discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl

The high street revolution has been a financial disaster for the likes of Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.

Tesco has lost around half its market value – about £15billion – in just one year, amid a record fall in sales that has followed decades of growth. 

Such is the pressure on the chain that some senior executives stand accused of signing off suspect accounts which appear to have overstated profits by £250million.

Industry figures show Tesco’s sales are down by 4.5 per cent, while takings are down by 2.8 per cent at Sainsbury’s and 1.8 per cent at Morrisons.

Research by the Institute of Grocery Distribution found 54 per cent of consumers have visited a discount store in search of bargains in the past month.

As a result, sales are up by 29.1 per cent at Aldi and 17.7 per cent at Lidl as the two chains race to open new outlets at the rate of two a week.

Morrisons has announced its intention to match the low prices of discount supermarkets

Joanne Denney-Finch, IGD chief executive, said: ‘Over half of shoppers tell us they’ve used a discounter in the past month, which is the highest level for four years when we started tracking the data.

‘Examples of good retail disciplines that shoppers tell us they like about discounters include: it’s easy to find things, they can get around the store really quickly and the meat is clearly labelled as British.

‘Over half of shoppers want price cuts more than multi-buys … People want pricing that makes a real difference.’

Morrisons boss Dalton Philips has described the retail change as the biggest since the rise of the big-box supermarkets in the 1950s.

Last week he unveiled a bid to ‘neutralise’ the threat from Aldi and Lidl by launching a loyalty card scheme – the first to try and match their prices.

Mike Watkins, head of Retail Insight for Nielsen described the price falls as ‘historic’.
