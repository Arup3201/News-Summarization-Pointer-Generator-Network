An all-in-one home brewing kit that takes just 10 days to make 20 pints of cider, is launching this month. Victor's drinks aims to banish memories of dodgy home brews with its new no-frills kit that costs £20

Critically, the kit is made from apples without the addition of additives and preservatives and brewers can customise the drink to their taste by leaving it for different periods of time.

The cider has a sweet, fruity taste after just 10 days of brewing, but gets drier the longer it is left, according to the company.

The firm said: 'Remember the days of being offered some 
murky, acrid potion at a best-forgotten house party, along with “You must
try this, we’ve been brewing it for months”? Well Victor’s is in a 
different league.'

The product, which comes in a box with everything inside, has been created by a team of young entrepreneurs. Critically the kit is made from apples without additives and preservatives and home brewers can customise the drink to their taste by leaving it for different periods of time

Project manager, Cecelia Broadbent, said: '2013 has seen duty rise on alcohol and supermarkets being held to ransom over minimum pricing.

'One
thing is for sure, alcohol is only going to get more expensive, while 
people’s budgets are going to be under a lot more strain.'

The company hopes a younger generation of people will embrace home brewing.
