Taking precautions: Harris County District Attorney Mike Anderson now has a round-the-clock security detail because other lawmakers have been targeted by assassins

The district attorney for Houston is now being trailed by a 24-hour security team after a fellow Texas lawmaker and his wife were assassinated on Saturday.

Authorities have said little about the investigation into the deaths of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, whose bodies were found Saturday.

The couple's slayings came less than two weeks after Colorado's prison chief was shot to death at his front door, apparently by an ex-convict, and a couple of months after Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse was killed in a parking lot near his courthouse office. No arrests have been made in Hasse's January 31 killing.

The highest-profile official to accept the protection has been Mike Anderson, the district attorney for Harris County, which includes Houston.

'Mike has accepted additional security offered by Sheriff Garcia, just in case there are any immediate threats in Harris County,' his spokesperson Sara Marie Kinney told The Houston Chronicle.

'This danger is present every day. They put bad people behind bars everyday, and prosecutors and investigators carry this with them every day.

'It's sad, it's tragic. It weighs heavy on Mike, but it's not going to let it stop him, or anyone in this office, from doing their job.'

Kaufman County district attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia. were found murdered in their home Saturday

Authorities have yet to prove a connection the killings but are assuming one exists until evidence shows otherwise

Deputies escorted some Kaufman County employees into the courthouse Monday as other officers were seen patrolling one side of the courthouse, one holding a semi-automatic weapon, while others walked around inside.

'I don't want to walk around in fear every day... but on the other hand, two months ago, we wouldn't be having this conversation,' County Judge Bruce Wood, the county's top administrator, said Monday at a news conference.

Assistant DA Mark Hasse was gunned down in January, and had recently pursued cases involving the Aryan brotherhood

Law enforcement agencies throughout Texas were on high alert, and steps were being taken to better protect other DAs and their staffs.

In Harris County, which includes Houston, District Attorney Mike Anderson said he accepted the sheriff's offer of 24-hour security for him and his family. Anderson said he also would take precautions at his office, the largest of its kind in Texas, with more than 270 prosecutors.

'I think district attorneys across Texas are still in a state of shock,' Anderson said Sunday.

McLelland, 63, was the 13th prosecutor
killed in the U.S. since the National Association of District Attorneys
began keeping count in the 1960s.

Kaufman
County Sheriff David Byrnes would not give details Sunday of how the 
killings unfolded and said there was nothing to indicate for certain 
whether the DA's slaying was connected to Hasse's.

El
Paso County, Colorado, sheriff's spokesman Sergeant Joe Roybal said 
investigators had so far found no evidence connecting the Texas killings
to the Colorado case, but added: 'We're examining all possibilities.'

Colorado's
corrections director, Tom Clements, was killed March 19 when he 
answered the doorbell at his home outside Colorado Springs.

Evan
Spencer Ebel, a white supremacist and former Colorado inmate suspected 
of shooting Clements, died in a shootout with Texas deputies two days 
later about 100 miles from Kaufman.

In an Associated Press interview shortly after the Colorado slaying, McLelland himself raised the possibility that Hasse was gunned down by a white supremacist gang.

McLelland, elected in 2010, said his office had prosecuted several cases against such gangs, particularly one known as the Aryan Brotherhood.

The groups have a strong presence around Kaufman County, a mostly rural area dotted with subdivisions, with a population of about 104,000.

After Hasse's slaying, McLelland said, he carried a gun everywhere around town, even when walking his dog.

He figured assassins were more likely to try to attack him outside. He said he had warned all his employees to be constantly on the alert.

'The people in my line of work are going to have to get better at it,' he said of dealing with the danger, 'because they're going to need it more in the future.'

The number of attacks on prosecutors, judges and senior law enforcement officers in the U.S. has spiked in the past three years, according to Glenn McGovern, an investigator with the Santa Clara County, California district attorney's office who tracks such cases.

For about a month after Hasse's slaying, sheriff's deputies were parked in the district attorney's driveway, said Sam Rosander, a McLelland neighbor.

The FBI and the Texas Rangers joined the investigation into the McLellands' deaths.
