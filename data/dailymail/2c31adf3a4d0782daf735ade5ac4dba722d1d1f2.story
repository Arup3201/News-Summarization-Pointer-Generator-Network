Tragedy: Retired headmaster Denis Drew and wife Joyce, both 86, died after they were knocked down while on their regular evening walk

A devoted couple walking hand in hand on a quiet village road were knocked down and killed on the stroll they took together every evening.

Retired headmaster Denis Drew and wife Joyce, both 86, were last seen holding hands on their regular evening walk after 54 years of marriage.

Both were hit by a blue hatchback car and rushed to hospital.

Mrs Drew died hours later and her husband died in hospital after five days in a critical condition.

A 20-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of death by dangerous driving and released on police bail after the incident a fortnight ago.

The couple's family today described them as 'a duo' who were always holding hands right up until their last moment together.

Daughters Sarah England, 53, and Helen Adam, 50, said the deaths had left them 'completely devastated with a huge hole in our lives.'

Mr and Mrs Drew were pedestrians as they walked through their home village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, Gwent.

The family say one comfort is that the devoted couple were together up until their last moments.

Mrs England said: 'Everyone we have spoken to has said they can't imagine one without the other.

'We feel very privileged to have had them as parents. The effect that they had on a lot of people makes us feel very proud of them.'

Former RAF airman Mr Drew trained as a teacher - and met his wife on a blind date.

He was a headteacher in three primary school in Gwent before he retired.

His daughter said: 'He just seemed to have a very gentle and patient nature but he was actually very strong and tough.'

Mrs Drew was a registrar of births, deaths and marriages in Pontypool, Gwent, but was a stalwart member of village Woman's Institute.

Mrs Adam said: 'She ruled the roost but she also knew if dad put his foot down. They were a duo.'

Lifelong friend Glyn Parry, 86, said: 'They were a devoted and loving couple. He was a very good headteacher and teacher. It is such a tragic event.'

Village vicar Reverend Kevin Lake said: 'Their tragic death has devastated members of our church family. They will be truly missed but we have wonderful and cherished memories of them.'

Police have appealed for witnesses.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
