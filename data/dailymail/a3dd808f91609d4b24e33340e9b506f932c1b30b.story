The WW9000 machine is allows a person to control and monitor their washing using their smartphone

Finding time to put a load of washing on and take it out again before it starts to dry can be taxing when trying to juggle other household chores.

But Samsung has set out to make the job less onerous with the launch of a smart washing machine that can be operated using a smartphone app.

The WW9000 machine is the first domestic Wi-Fi washing machine to be sold in the UK.

It is also the first to be made by the company that allows a person to remotely control and monitor their washing using their mobile – letting them get about and about while their clothes are being cleaned.

Samsung is not the only manufacturer to offer machines that can interact with a smartphone.

LG and Haier have smart models and Samsung itself has equipped some current machines with a feature called Smart Check, which allows people to detect and diagnose errors with an app.

But the WW9000 is the only one in the range to let people start and stop a cycle from their mobile.

The futuristic washing machine, which will go on sale in May across Europe, also has a ‘super speed wash setting’ that cleans clothes in under an hour by quickly filling the drum with water through its twin water supply. It is not known if or when the model will be sold in the U.S. or Asia.

An 'auto optimal wash' option uses four sensing technologies to determine the right wash cycle, looking at temperature, washing time, rinse cycle and spin speed, based on the size of the laundry load and how dirty the clothes are.

It has intelligent settings to tackle specific kind of stains, including gardening and cooking, as well as sports and hygiene care functions, but Samsung has not yet said how much the smart machine will cost.

The array of options can be navigated by a 5inch colour touchscreen instead of knobs and dials so that the machine can easily display the most used and favourite settings to let users navigate all the options easily.

The machine has been designed to reduce the amount of energy used by using an ‘ecobubble’ generator to dissolve detergent quicker.

Air and water are pulled in to generate bubbles, dissolving and activating the detergent, which then penetrates faster and more evenly throughout the wash load, according to Samsung.

This helps to dissolve washing detergent, creating rich soapy foam that penetrates clothes faster, so less hot water is required, and therefore saves energy on every load, it claims.

The WW9000 model has an extra large door and a ‘translucent deep blue crystal finish’ that Samsung says ‘creates a beautiful spectrum of colours when it comes into contact with light’.

Design: A big door is placed higher up than usual on the machine so that people do not have to bend down as far to retrieve their washing from the machine, which has a streamlined appearance.

Easy to use: A five inch colour screen lets people choose cycles, including their most-used cycle, by touching a button. The washing can be started and stopped using a smartphone app.

Auto-optimal wash: Sensing technology is used to gather information about the size and dirtiness of the load as well as how much detergent is needed. Based on this information, the setting determines the most suitable wash cycle, temperature, time, rinse cycle and spin speed.

Super Speed Wash: Laundry can be done in 60 minutes as the machine uses a twin water supply to fill the drum quickly.

Specialty cycles: These are cycles designed to blitz garden and cooking stains, among others.

Energy saving: The washer uses ‘ecobubble’ technology. Air and water are pulled in to generate bubbles, dissolving the detergent faster so that temperatures can be lower and less energy is used.

Quiet: A 3D vibration sensor system keeps the drum well balanced at high spin speeds by ensuring 14 stainless steel balls spin together in the opposite direction to the laundry load. At lower drum speeds, powerful magnets hold the balls firmly in place and significantly decrease vibration and noise, the company said.
