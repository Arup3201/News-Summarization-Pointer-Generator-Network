Yemen says it has foiled an audacious Al
 Qaeda plot to blow up oil pipelines and seize key ports, as US special 
operations forces reportedly prepare for action in the country.

Security forces thwarted a plan by terrorists to take over oil and gas export facilities and a provincial 
capital in the eastern part of the country, a government official said 
today.

Rajeh Badi, press advisor to Yemeni Prime Minister Mohammed Salem Basindwa, said the plot involved dozens of Al Qaeda militants dressed in Yemeni army uniforms storming the facilities on the night of the 27th of the Muslim month of Ramadan, which was on Sunday.

The plot was apparently discovered after
 US intelligence officers intercepted a conference call between senior 
leaders of Al Qaeda.

More than 20 operatives were involved in
 the call, which mainly involved Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, and 
Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of Al Qaeda’s affiliate based in Yemen, 
according to The Daily Beast.

Badi said: 'The plot aimed to seize 
the al-Dabbah oil export terminal in Hadramout [province] and the Belhaf
 gas export facility, as well as the city of Mukalla [Hadramout 
provincial capital].'

He said the bid was prevented by 
Yemeni forces deploying extra troops around the targeted facilities and 
banning anyone from entering.[related]

News of the foiled plot emerged after the United States evacuated some 
American diplomatic staff out of Yemen and told nationals to leave the 
country immediately after warnings of potential attacks that had 
prompted Washington to shut missions across the Middle East.

Britain, France, the Netherlands and Norway also closed their embassies
 in Sanaa and some evacuated their staff.

It was not immediately clear if the foiled plot was linked to these security measures.

Bomb fear: Al Qaeda terrorists may have developed a new liquid explosive that can be applied to clothing and is completely undetectable by current airport security systems

Yemen, one of the poorest Arab 
countries, is the base for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), one
 of the most active branches of the network founded by Osama bin Laden, 
and militants have launched attacks from there against the West.

It emerged today that officials are 
investigating the theory that Al Qaeda terrorists could try to bring 
down planes using an undetectable explosive soaked into their clothes.

The
 organisation’s bomb-makers are reportedly developing an ‘ingenious’ 
system whereby shirts and trousers drenched in the explosive could be 
ignited when dry.

It would 
be undetectable under current security measures and remove the need for 
terrorists to mix liquid explosives on board, security sources told the 
American TV network ABC News yesterday.

The latest threat to air passengers is
 one of the reasons behind the current global terror alert, according to
 two senior US government officials.

British bomb expert Sidney Alford 
confirmed that the new method was possible using easily available 
chemicals, but pulling it off would be tricky as the soaking process 
would dilute the explosive.

He said: ‘The clothes act as a diluent and reduce the power of the explosives.’

However, igniting treated clothes 
could be done simply with a match. Passengers are allowed to carry a 
single box of safety matches or a cigarette lighter on flights.

The new explosive has reportedly been 
developed by the notorious bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri of Al Qaeda in 
the Arabian Peninsula, who made the device used by convicted ‘underwear 
bomber’ Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up a plane on 
Christmas Day in 2009.

Other reports have suggested that Al-Asiri is developing bombs that could be sewn under the skin of terrorists.

The level of ‘terror chatter’ being 
monitored by security services has been described as one of the most 
serious threats to American and Western interests since the 9/11 
attacks.

In response, the Foreign Office last 
night evacuated all staff from the British embassy in Yemen.

The U.S. State Department, based at the White House, Washington (pictured), has instructed its embassies and consulates in the Muslim word that would normally be open on Sunday to close this weekend amid reports of an unspecified threat

Those 
posted in Sana’a, the capital – including ambassador Jane Marriott, who 
has only been there a month – were told to return to the UK because of 
‘increased security concerns’.

The US also ordered all non-essential 
personnel at its Yemeni embassy to get out, and American citizens still 
in the country were flown to safety by military aircraft.

Dozens of Al Qaeda operatives are said
 to have streamed into Sana’a in the past few days, forcing the 
country’s military to use ‘extraordinary and unprecedented’ security 
measures to protect official buildings.

At the same time, at least four 
suspected terrorists have been killed in an American drone strike in the
 eastern Marib region of Yemen.

The drone fired a missile at a car carrying the four men, setting it on fire and killing all of them, the officials said.

On Sunday  20 US embassies and consulates were closed after conversations between two senior al-Qaeda figures. The U.S. Embassy in Amman (pictured), the capital of Jordan, is among those closed

In Kabul, Afghanistan, where thousands of U.S. troops remain stationed, the U.S. Embassy (pictured) will also be closed this Sunday

Speaking
 on condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to talk to the 
media, the officials said they believe one of the dead is Saleh Jouti, a
 senior Al Qaeda member.

It's the fourth drone attack in the past week to hit a car believed to be carrying Al Qaeda members.

On
 Sunday  20 US embassies and consulates were closed after conversations 
between two senior al-Qaeda figures, including top leader Ayman 
al-Zawahiri,  were intercepted.

Western embassies in the capital of Sanaa are also being protected.

The State Department said in a travel
 warning that it had ordered the departure of non-emergency U.S. 
government personnel from Yemen 'due to the continued potential for 
terrorist attacks' and said U.S. citizens in Yemen should leave 
immediately because of an 'extremely high' security threat level.

'As
 staff levels at the Embassy are restricted, our ability to assist U.S. 
citizens in an emergency and provide routine consular services remains 
limited and may be further constrained by the fluid security situation,'
 the travel warning said.

succeeded Osama bin Laden - and Nasser al-Wuhayshi (right)

The BBC reports that the White House and the US state department say the current threat comes from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but have refused to release further details.

The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: 'Due to increased security concerns, all staff in the British embassy have been temporarily withdrawn and the embassy will remain closed until staff are able to return.'

Several European countries have also temporarily shut missions in Yemen.

Known as Al-Qaeda's bomb-maker in chief, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri is believed to be behind a range of explosive devices including pant bombs and liquid explosive implants which contain no metal parts making them virtually undetectable.

Al-Asiri, 31, who is linked to the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) group, was reported to have recruited his own brother Abdullah al-Asiri as a suicide bomber in a failed 2009 attempt to assassinate Saudi Arabia's Deputy Minister of the Interior.

An early version of his pant bomb was used in the the 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot, when a Nigerian man attempted unsuccessfully to detonate the device aboard a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.

An updated version, which incorporated fail-safe triggers and used a new kind of explosive that was even harder to detect was supplied for a terrorist attack in May last year to mark the anniversary of Osama Bin Laden’s death.

That plot was foiled when the suicide bomber turned out to be a double agent and handed the device to the FBI

He is also believed to have been behind an intercepted pair of explosives-laden printers that were mailed from Yemen to the U.S. in 2010.

In September last year he was reported as having been possibly killed in a drone strike together with other AQAP suspects but a Yemeni government official later denied the claim.

He is currently considered to be one of America's most wanted men. 'He’s the main guy,' said one counterterrorism official. 'He’s the top of any list.'

Al-Asiri has been described as a critical component of al Qaeda's activities in Yemen and his death would be a significant blow to the organization.
