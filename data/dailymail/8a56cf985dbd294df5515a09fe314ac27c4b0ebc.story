Dropped: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is no longer listed among the top 10 most powerful people in the world but is now the 25th

Mark Zuckerberg has dropped out of the Top 10 Most Powerful People in the World after the bungled stock market floatation of Facebook.

The founder of the social network fell from ninth to 25th place in the Forbes rankings after what the magazine called a ‘debacle’ of a launch.

He is one of the biggest movers in this year’s list and is now only one spot above media mogul Rupert Murdoch.

He also trails fellow tech titans Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, who are jointly tied at 20.

Forbes
had already released its list of 400 Richest Americans for 2012 which 
found that Zuckerberg had lost nearly half of his $17.5 billion fortune.

He is now worth $9.4 billion having seen $8.1 billionvanish from his personal worth over the last 12 months.

The
only bright spot for 2012 for the 28-year-old was that he married long 
term girlfriend Priscilla Chan in a ceremony at his mansion in Palo 
Alto, California.

Facebook also hit 1bn users in October for the first time, or around one sixth of the world population.

In
its verdict on Zuckerberg’s influence, Forbes said that in May 
investors were ‘giddy’ when it went public and asked themselves: ‘How 
high will it go?’

Disappointment: When Facebook went public earlier this year, investors eagerly purchased stock in what would lead to shockingly disappointing results

Abrupt decline: Forbes mutually reports Zuckerberg having lost nearly half of his $17.5 billion fortune in the last 12 months

Forbes writes: ‘That was then. Facebook's IPO was a debacle, and its stock remains far below the original $38 a share’.

Barack Obama

Angela Merkel

Vladimir Putin

Bill Gates

Pope Benedict XVI

Ben Bernanke

Abdullah bim Abdul Aziz al Saud

Mario Gradhi

Xi Jinping

David Cameron

In fact, the price slumped by nearly half
to below $20 a share amid a flurry of lawsuits, finger pointing and 
recriminations that will linger for years to come.

Facebook’s floatation was dubbed the 
worst such event in modern history after a perfect storm of technical 
glitches and overpricing the stock rendered it a failure.

Zuckerberg
was personally sued for $2.9 billion for allegedly deceiving smaller 
shareholders by not telling them about his private concerns.

Meanwhile institutional investors were supposedly informed, giving them a chance to get out fast.

In September, in his first public comments on the episode, Zuckerberg admitted the stock market floatation had been bungled.

He also revealed that company had ‘burned two years’ by not working on Facebook for mobile devices.

Most powerful: U.S. President Barack Obama remains at number one since last year while German Chancellor Angela Merkel moved from fourth place to second

According to the Forbes list, the Most Powerful Person in the World is still President Obama, who held the top spot last year.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel moves up from fourth to second and Russian President Vladimir Putin is third.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates is fourth and Pope Benedict XVI, who recently joined Twitter, is in at five.

Among those who have dropped out of the list entirely are Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, both of whom have announced they won’t return to their posts for President Obama’s second term.
