Franck Ribery insists that he will never leave Bayern Munich for another European club and claimed his current manager Pep Guardiola is the best he's ever worked with.

The winger is seen as a key player at the Allianz Arena following his move from Olympique Marseille in 2007 and has established himself as a fan's favourite.

The 31-year-old's deal at the Bundesliga side runs out in 2017 but with moving to another European club out of the question - Ribery admits he could spend a season overseas.

'There will not be another club after Bayern,' Ribery told TZ.

'I don't want to go to another club in the future.

'Perhaps I might go for a completely different experience and play in the USA or Dubai for one season.

'But I will never play for another club than Bayern again in Europe. I have too much respect for the club and for everything they have done for me.' 

Ribery also praised manager Pep Guardiola and lauded the ex-Barcelona man as the best coach he's ever worked with.

The Spaniard's future at Bayern has come into question, with reports saying he could be set for a return to the Catalan side. 

'He is without a doubt the best coach I have ever had,' the French attacker said. 'I have never met a trainer who knows so much about the game. The level of detail he can go into.

'I have a great relationship with him. It's great that he joined Bayern. He already won a lot at Barcelona and took his qualities with him to Bayern. We learned a lot in his first season here.

'Things are going even better now we fully understand him. He is a great coach who tries new things all the time.

'I think he will stay at Bayern until after 2016, but the final decision is up to him.'
