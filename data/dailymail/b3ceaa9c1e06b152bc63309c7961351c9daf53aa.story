'RIP beautiful girl': PR executive Denni North was found dead in a swimming pool in Bali after moving from Australia to work at a beach club in Kuta

A vivacious public relations executive who moved from her Australian home to work in a luxury beach club in Bali has been found dead in a swimming pool in the popular tourist region of Kuta.

Denni North, 33, was reportedly found lying face down in the swimming pool – and the sudden death of the popular fun-loving adventure-seeking blonde has shocked her family and friends.

Police in Indonesia and Australia were today investigating the circumstances surrounding her death, but no further details of how she ended up in the pool were immediately available.

The location of the swimming pool has also yet to be revealed.

At
the Cocoon Beach Club in Kuta, where Miss North worked, staff expressed
shock at the death of the ‘beautiful and vivacious’ woman.

In
a post on the club’s Facebook page the management wrote that ‘it is 
with incredible sadness that we announce that one of our Cocoon family, 
Denni North, passed away suddenly on Sunday morning.’

They added: ‘Our sincerest condolences go out to the family and friends of this beautiful and vivacious young woman.

‘Denni, you will be so missed by so many. RIP beautiful girl.’

A close friend paid tribute to ‘a loving caring soul who always put others first.’

The
friend said on Facebook: ‘I still don’t believe my beautiful friend is 
gone. My dearest, closest friend, we shared so many stories and 
travelled the world together.

‘I love her so much. She will be missed every single day of my life.’

Australia’s
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed today that consular 
officials in Canberra were providing assistance to Miss North’s family 
in Australia.

An anonymous 
posting on Facebook said: ‘Denni was a PR professional (who) had been 
living and working in Kuta. She was found laying face down in a Kuta 
pool. RIP.’

On its website, 
the Cocoon Beach Club claims to be the most luxurious venue on Bali, 
nestling among palm trees and frangipani flowers.

‘Inspired
by the idyllic surroundings of the famous Bali beaches and combined 
with Mediterranean flair, Cocoon offers fine dining, relaxed ambience, 
fashion and fun’ the club says.

‘Long
after the sun has gone down and desserts devoured, Cocoon transforms 
again into a sophisticated bar/lounge offering the best in music, 
cocktails and a fashionably savvy crowd.’

The Cocoon Beach Club is located on the south of the Indonesia island of Bali
