The Royal British legion is launching a major campaign that it hopes will extend the traditional two minute silence on Remembrance Sunday to the Twitter-generation.

A new social media tool will allow millions of Facebook and Twitter users to pay their respects to servicemen and women who have lost their lives at war online.

The charity is the UK's first to embrace the American technology, known as Thunderclap, which allows social media users who have opted to take part to send a simultaneous Tweet or status update.

It is hoped that through 'likes' and retweets, the Royal British Legion message will reach a large chunk of the UK's 10 million Twitter and 33 million Facebook users.

Helen Hill, head of Remembrance at the 
charity, said: 'We hope to create the largest ever show of online 
Remembrance by using the communicative power of social media to remind 
millions of Britons that they have a very personal opportunity to honour
the men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice.'

Thunderclap is the first 
'crowdspeaking' platform that allows a charity or cause to produce a 
single message that can be mass-shared simultaneously.

It is the brainchild of New York 
studio De-De, a spin-off of advertising agency Droga5, and was developed
with the aim to get important messages to stand out above the babble of
social media.

Chief executive Hashem Bajwa said: 'Twitter is a wonderful way to say something, but it's difficult to be heard.

'Thunderclap lets people be heard by saying something together.'

Thousands gather to pay their respects on Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph in London. Thunderclap technology will allow millions of Twitter and Facebook users to simultaneously post their respects

More than three quarters of the UK population are expected to observe the period of silence next week which has been traditional on the second Sunday of November since 1919 following the Armistice to end the First World War signed at 11am on November 11 1918.

Social network users can join in the Thunderclap by clicking to authorise their Twitter and Facebook accounts to send the tweet or message that will read: 'I'll be remembering the fallen at 11 o'clock #2MinuteSilence #LestWeForget' at 9am on Sunday.

When they sign up, their Twitter or Facebook feed will also automatically display the message: 'I won't forget to Remember on 11.11.11 Will you? #2MinuteSilence.'
