Louis van Gaal has not gone trophyless in his first season at Manchester United after all as the Dutchman received the Anton Geesink Award in his native country on Sunday night. 

The award, named in honour of deceased Dutch judo legend Anton Geesink, is awarded every year to a person, city or organisation for their 'remarkable sport performance'. 

The judges felt Van Gaal was a worthy recipient on the back of his impressive performances leading the Netherlands at the World Cup last summer.

Van Gaal's last chance for silverware went up in smoke at the beginning of the month when United crashed to a 2-1 FA Cup quarter-final defeat against Arsenal at Old Trafford. 

The defeat to the Gunners all but ended Van Gaal's search for a trophy in his debut season in England.  

'For me this award is very special since I have personally known Anton for many years.' said Van Gaal.

'Anton and I have the same character and we have both struggled, although with different resistances.' 

United are currently fourth in the Premier League table as they look to secure a coveted Champions League spot for next season.
