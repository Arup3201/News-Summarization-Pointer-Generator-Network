When Sophie the cat saw snow for the first time, she didn't know whether to step on it or lick it - so she did both.

Adorable video captured the moment the curious kitty pawed nervously at the white powder before bravely gamboling across the snow-covered yard in Alabama.

A YouTube clip, uploaded by user mikegee00 on Thursday, has been viewed more than 268,000 times.

The sweet clip showed Sophie being gently poked by her owner to venture out into the yard.

The confused pussycat carefully tapped the icy powder before scampering away as the snow delicately fell around her.

But it didn't take long for Sophie to begin enjoying the experience - scampering across the snow, scooping mounds in her paws and even apparently licking the ice.

By the end of the clip, the yard is full of feline paw prints and Sophie is looking very happy with her new-found love of snow stalking.Â
