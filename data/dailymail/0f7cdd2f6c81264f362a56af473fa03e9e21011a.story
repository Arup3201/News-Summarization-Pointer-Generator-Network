A California man has been arrested after two quick-thinking brothers saw him beating his Cocker Spaniel for ten minutes and pulled out their camera to catch him in the sickening act.

The boys, age 12 and 17, were inside their home in Chino Hills with their mother last month when they heard the animal crying and ran upstairs to look out a window to see what was going on.

They were horrified to see a man - later identified as Qihui Zhai, 21 - allegedly taunting and beating the three-year-old dog, called Mookie, with a short stick as she desperately tried to out-run him.

One of the boys grabbed a camera and filmed the heinous act, while his mother called the Inland Valley Humane Society & SPCA, the animal welfare organization said.

Heartbreaking: Two youngsters filmed this man as he threatened and beat his Cocker Spaniel with a stick

'I'm sorry doggie,' one of the boys murmurs on the video as the animal whimpers and jumps in terror whenever her owner approaches.

'I bet you he beats it everyday,' the boy continues. 'And even
 if it did something really bad, like bite him, heâ€™s been doing this for
 the past seven minutes that I've been here.

'I heard him more 
downstairs, but I thought the dog was just playing around.'

Shortly
 after the mother called authorities, Humane Officer William Taber 
arrived at the scene and found that Mookie had been neglected and was 
being kept inside a 'very small, feces infested wire pen', a release from the society said.

Cruel: The man, later identified as 21-year-old Qihui Zhai, allegedly beat the pet for ten minutes as the young boys looked on, horrified. Their mother called the SPCA and officers later arrested Zhai

The
 officer took Mookie to the Inland Valley Humane Society & SPCA, 
where a shelter veterinarian examined and treated her. She has since 
healed and has been placed in a new home.

When animal control officers confronted Zhai, he initially tried to deny the allegations, but when he was told 
about the video, he changed his denial, CBS Los Angeles reported.

The welfare society said that they thanked the two youngsters, who have not been identified, for their help in catching the man.

'We are never surprised by the ingenuity of today's youth,' said Beth Les, Supervisor of Animal Services of the Inland Valley Humane Society.

Happy: Mookie, pictured after treatment, has now been placed in a loving home, the SPCA said

'Their 
quick thinking not only saved this dog from a life time of abuse but 
they were able to ensure we had the evidence to pursue criminal charges 
against the abuser.'

Zhai, a resident of Chino Hills, was charged on June 6 with one felony of count of animal cruelty and was scheduled to be arraigned on June 30 in Rancho Cucamonga Superior Court.

He had the dog for just three weeks before the alleged incident occurred

If convicted, he could face jail time and/or fines.
