A paraplegic man who says he was stranded in the New Mexico desert without his wheelchair dragged himself about four miles down a dirt road over three days before a motorist stopped to help him.

Tattered and dirty, Ricky Gilmore's blue jeans tell part of the story. His body tells the rest - the skin on his left leg and buttocks is shredded, his wrist is sprained and his kidneys are in bad shape from going without food and water.

'Ah man, I'm just a big mess. I ache and I'm just in the first stages of healing,' he told The Associated Press on Tuesday from his hospital bed at the Northern Navajo Medical Center in Shiprock, New Mexico.

Gilmore, 49, said he was dropped in the 
desert by a couple in a white truck who he met while he was hitchhiking.
He had invited them to his home for steaks and they later went for what
Gilmore thought was going to be a joyride.

When
he declined to share his alcohol with them, Gilmore said the man 
grabbed him by his feet and threw him out of the truck while parked 
along the desolate road.

It 
was early evening and Gilmore had nothing - no wheelchair, no food, no 
water, no coat - to help him endure the flat desert scrubland.

'It
was dark and I was shivering and the wind was blowing so I just crawled
to a bush and dug in right there. It was cold that night,' he said.

With the sunrise, survival mode kicked in.

'I started dragging myself. I did the same thing all day and I only got about two miles,' he said.

Two people passed by. Gilmore tried flagging them down but they only honked and kept going.

After spending a second night at the side of the road, Gilmore said he woke up sore and thirsty and didn't want to move.

'I
could have easily gave up and said forget it, but I said I'm not going 
to freeze out here and I just kept on going,' said Gilmore, who lives by
himself and lost the use of his legs in a car crash years ago.

On
the third afternoon, a man in a blue pickup truck stopped and called 
for help. Gilmore said doctors told him his body temperature was 94 when
he was found.

'I don't think I would have made it another night,' he said.

Gilmore is being treated for acute 
kidney failure from dehydration, a sprained wrist and a blood infection.
He spent two days in intensive care and it could be at least another 
week before he can go home.

The Farmington Daily Times first 
reported Gilmore's story. He was found along a seldom traveled road on 
the Navajo Nation about 10 miles from his home in Newcomb, which is on 
the eastern side of the reservation.

The Daily Times reported that Gilmore filed a report with the Shiprock Police Department. There were no officials at the department after hours Tuesday who could confirm details of the report.

Gilmore said he's bandaged up 'big time' and morphine is helping with the pain. Still, he had a nightmare Monday night in which he found himself sitting at the edge of a freeway waving his hands at the passing traffic, but no one looked at him.

His plan is simple for when he gets released from the hospital: 'Go home and pray, take inventory and just get a good night sleep in my own bed and heal.'
