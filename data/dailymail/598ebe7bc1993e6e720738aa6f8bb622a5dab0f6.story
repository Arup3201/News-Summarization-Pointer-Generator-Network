A mother with seven boys, who was so desperate for a girl that she spent $50,000 flying over to the US to ensure she could add daughters to her growing brood, said she was a victim of cyber bullying.

Jodi McMahon, from Tumut in rural NSW, decided to make the trip overseas to have the option to choose the gender of her youngest children via IVF.

Ms McMahon, along with husband Andrew, sparked a national debate in 2012 when they spoke publicly on Channel Nine program 60 Minutes about their choice to take matters into their own hands when their plans to use gender selection IVF in NSW were stalled by changes that outlawed the option in Australia.

Jodi McMahon said she bullied online after her story that revealed she would be spending $50,000 to choose the gender of her children aired on 60 Minutes

When their story was revealed, malicious critics took to the internet to shame the family's extreme lengths to have sisters for siblings Luke, Aiden, Josh, Billy, Cody and Declan.

Some went as far as threatening to drive to Ms McMahon's Tumut home to 'get the b****'.

'I got bullied [online],' Mrs McMahon told 9 Stories.

'There was only like a handful of people who took it to the extreme, they were just nasty, just plain out nasty.

'They said nasty horrible things, which I would be pretty sure not all those people would say to your face.'

She and her husband, Andrew, travelled to the US where gender selection IVF is legal

Now the McMahons have two girls, Addison - who born in 2011 - and Evie - born in 2012.

Despite the bullying and the cost of their conception, Ms McMahon does not have any regrets.

'I just look at [the girls'] when they go to bed at night and I just think every night how lucky I am that my dream and my plan all worked out and all paid off,' she said.

Ms McMahon was also adamant Addison and Evie received no special treatment.

'[They] aren't loved more than the boys, they're disciplined the same way, it's not like they're on a pedestal,' she said.

'There was no magic moment [when they were born], I've got to tell you,' Mrs McMahon said.

'It was just like, "That hurt and now the baby's out and now it doesn't hurt anymore".

'Even with Evie there was no magic moment - hers was the most unattractive birth.

'60 Minutes thought about wanting to videotape that [but] they wouldn't have put it on TV. I was vomiting while I was giving birth, it was not a pretty birth.'

With seven boys (only five are pictured here), Ms McMahon desperately yearned to have daughters. She now has two, Addison and Evie

Ms McMahon also added that she would not withholdhow much they costÂ  from her daughters and said the family already joked the girls were 'made in America'.

The McMahons were one of the estimated 100 Australian couples who travelled overseas each year to countries where choosing a baby's gender through IVF was legal - including the US, Cyprus and Thailand.

A poll done last year by Roy Morgan Research, which was commissioned by leading IVF expert Professor Gab Kovacs, found 92 per cent of Australians supported the costly procedure, but only 20 per cent agreed with gender selection.

Critics believe it encourages the concept of designer babies and are against it even when it is used as a tool to balance out genders in a family.

But research shows this never occurs in countries where gender selection is legal.
