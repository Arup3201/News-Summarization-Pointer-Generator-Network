Police have dropped an investigation into a stolen mobile phone even though the female victim tracked down the thief, giving police a dossier of evidence including the suspect’s photo.

Sylvia Parnell, 68, was ‘furious’ when police told her they were dropping the case despite the fact that she had traced the suspect to various addresses using a tracking device on her phone.

Her phone, a Samsung Galaxy worth £500, was stolen from a west London cafe but Ms Parnell was able to trace it to addresses in Harrow, north-west London and various addresses in central London using a tracking ‘find my phone’ app which was installed on the mobile.

'On a plate': Sylvia Parnell gave evidence to police, including a photo of the suspect and various addresses, to catch the thief who stole her phone from a cafe (in the background) but police have dropped the case

Police responded to one call after the phone was traced to a central London pub but were unable to make an arrest because there were too many people in the building.

Monitored by her son Thomas, an IT developer, he noticed that the suspect had returned to the same cafe where the phone was taken and Ms Parnell went there with a friend and noticed a man sitting alone who she says was acting suspiciously.

She took a picture of her friend with the man in the background and as the suspect left, Ms Parnell followed him to his car and recorded his registration details. She then gave this information to police.

Ms Parnell said she contacted police numerous times after first reporting the crime in June before they closed the case last week, telling her they did not have the resources to follow it up.

Suspect photographed: After tracing her mobile back to the cafe where her phone was stolen using a tracking app on her phone, Ms Parnell took this photo of her friend, with the man she believes stole her phone sitting behind him (to the right)

She said: ‘I had given him to them on a plate and in the same cafe - all they had to do was check it out. 

‘They just told me it wasn’t a priority and then said they wouldn’t be pursuing it any further.

'Gave them everything': Ms Parnell says she contacted police on several occasions but was left 'staggered by their attitude and frustrated that they wouldn't take any action'

‘I
told police all of this, gave them addresses, the photo and car 
registration. All in all I must have spoken to them seven or eight times
and wrote several letters. I was staggered by their attitude and 
frustrated that they wouldn’t take any action. 

‘I
am so angry. I feel like I have been fobbed off. How much help do the 
police want? I gave them everything.

'All they had to do was make some 
routine inquiries but they’ve just dropped it.

‘The police say they want help from the public to stop crime but my experience was the exact opposite.’

A police spokeswoman said: ‘The victim initially reported her phone as a theft on 5 July after she had left it in a cafe.

‘She did not recheck the tracker until over a month later on 15 August. It was reclassified as a theft-related crime on August 16 and the investigation was given to an officer to review the crime.

‘There was no evidence this “suspect” did have her phone, delay between original report of loss and tracking info given to police, more than a month, meant he could easily have obtained it innocently. Most robbers pass on within 24 hours.’

The case comes after a BBC reporter tracked down a robber who mugged him at knife point using a tracker app last week.

Following the incident, police said they had ‘had some real successes using tracker technology to trace stolen phones and computers’, urging members of the public to ‘help us to help you’.

Ms Parnell added: ‘I know it’s only a phone but if they can’t get the little things right how are they going to get the public to help on bigger crimes. 

‘For all I know this person could be a serial thief. All it would take is one junior officer to look into it, run the number plate through the system, that sort of thing.

‘My son wanted to go round to the address but I’m scared he will put himself in danger. We really shouldn’t have to do that.’
