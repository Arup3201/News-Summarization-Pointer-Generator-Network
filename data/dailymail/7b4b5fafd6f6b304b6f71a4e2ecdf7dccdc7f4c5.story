President Barack Obama caused quite a stir as he went for dinner at a restaurant with first lady Michelle Obama during their vacation on Martha's Vineyard yesterday.

The U.S. president was greeted with crowds as he arrived at The Sweet Life Cafe in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, while waitresses lined up at the windows of a nearby Thai restaurant to take pictures of the couple as they left.

The Obamas are in the middle of a two-week vacation on the island, from where he has had to deal with global crises involving Iraq, Gaza, Syria and terrorism and Ebola in Africa.

Earlier in the day it was reported that Hillary Clinton had mended fences with the president and 'looks forward to hugging it out' at a party just days after an interview was published in which she had harsh words for his handling of the crisis in Syria.

Speaking last week to The Atlantic, the former secretary of state said Obama's 'failure' to arm rebels opposed to dictator Bashar al-Assad 'left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.'

She was referring to the murderous terror group ISIS, which has left a swath of death and destruction in its wake as it plows through Iraq and claims to have established an Islamic caliphate.

A Clinton spokesman, however, said Tuesday that she had 'called President Obama to make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him, his policies, or his leadership.'

The statement, delivered first to Politico, acknowledged that Clinton and Obama have 'had honest differences on some issues, including aspects of the wicked challenge Syria presents.'

President Barack Obama is currently on vacation on the island of Martha's Vineyard

Hillary Clinton signs copies of her book Hard Choices in Huntington, New York last Wednesday. Clinton will be in Martha's Vineyard this week for another book signing

But '[l]ike any two friends who have to deal with the public eye, she looks forward to hugging it out when  they see each other tomorrow night.'

That could take the edge off of what may otherwise have been an awkward encounter at a party this evening on Martha's Vineyard.

The event will honour Ann Jordan, wife of Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan. 

Clinton, also a former first lady and senator from New York, served as Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Since then she has been touring the country giving a series of lucrative speeches and promoting her memoir, Hard Choices.

She will be on Martha's Vineyard to sign copies of her book today and is expected to meet Obama at the party tonight.
