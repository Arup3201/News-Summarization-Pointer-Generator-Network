Prosecutors have offered plea deals to the crew of New York City strippers accused of drugging wealthy men and taking them to strip clubs, where they would rack up racking up huge tabs on their credit cards.

A banker, a lawyer. a doctor and a real estate attorney were among the four unidentified victims plied with ecstasy, cocaine and prescription drugs and then taken to Scores in Manhattan and the RoadhHouse NYC Gentleman’s Club in Queens.

The four women — Samantha Barbash, Roselyn Keo, Karina Pacsucci and Marsi Rosen — were arrested in June on charges of grand larceny, assault and forgery after allegedly making a whopping $200,000.

Busted: Samantha Barbash is allegedly part of a crew of New York City strippers who scammed wealthy men by drugging them and running up extravagant bills at topless clubs while they were in a daze

Charged: Karina Pascucci arrives in court in June after being charged in connection with a scam involving exotic dancers in New York City

Barbash, the group's alleged leader, has been offered between two and three years in prison if she pleads guilty to grand larceny, conspiracy and assault, sources told the New York Post.

Pascuci and Rosen have been offered six months in jail and another six months in probation if they enter guilty pleas to attempted grand larceny and conspiracy, the Post reported.  

And Carmine Vitolo, a manager at RoadHouse, would get probation if she pleads guilty to conspiracy, grand larceny and tampering with evidence, according to the newspaper. 

The women would enter their pleas at their next appearance in Manhattan Supreme Court on December 5.

It is unclear if Keo has been offered a deal, the Post reported.

Prosecutors say the strippers would prowl bars in Manhattan and Long Island for their victims over a four month period beginning in September 2013.

They allegedly drugged the victims with Molly, a powerful powder form of ecstasy after arranging to meet them on 'dates'. 

Then the women would take the men to the clubs and bring them to private rooms for dances, where they would steal their cards and racked up huge charges, court records show.

The strippers falsely authorized tens of thousands of dollars to the victims' cards by forging their signatures and making them believe they were being charged for a lower amount.

'These individuals targeted and isolated victims in order to illegally obtain access to their credit cards and thousands of dollars of credit,' said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.

'Thanks to the hard work of the investigators and prosecutors in this case, these individuals will no longer be in a position to profit from this type of fraudulent activity.'

Prosecutors say Samantha Barbash led the extortion ring and threatened to blackmail some of her clients with photographs of them in compromising sexual positions from the night before

Ruthless: Samantha Barbash is allegedly the leader of a gang of strippers who have stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy male clients in New York City

The clubs paid the women for the visits, but the establishments were not facing criminal charges, authorities said according to the Post.

The men reported waking up in their cars or in hotel rooms with little or no memory of the encounters.

Those who tried to dispute the strip club bills received texts from the strippers threatening to go public with their transgressions, authorities said.

'The defendants were banking on the victims being too afraid to contact the police,' said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan to the New York Daily News. 'They made a serious miscalculation.'

Also charged: Marsi Rosen is also charged with being part of a crime ring of strippers who have allegedly stolen at least $200,000 from wealthy New York City men

In some cases, the strippers took photos and videoed the men in compromising sexual positions with women and men and threatened to blackmail them.

In May, Scores sued a cardiologist, saying he owed the club $135,303 for unpaid services.

According to the lawsuit, the doctor disputed the charges by saying 'he was drugged by plaintiff's employees and thus did not authorize the charges'— a claim the club says is contradicted by security video showing him freely showing up there on four separate occasions.

A source identified this man as Zyad Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.

According to The New York Daily News, Younan, denied he willingly authorized the $135,303 of charges.

Karina Pascucci is charged with assault and theft along with her three other stripper accomplices

'[This] indictment exposes a pattern of fraud that contributed to erroneous media reports,' said Michael Weinstein, attorney of one of the alleged victims.

'We were always confident that law enforcement’s efforts would expose that my client was preyed upon by this ring and not responsible for charges to his credit card.'

The three other unidentified victims were all allegedly conned for a total of $55,000.

Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan said the scam 'involved not only the theft of $200,000, but compromised the health, safety and security of victims by covertly giving them harmful substances.'
