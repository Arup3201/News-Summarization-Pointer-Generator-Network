England's friendly came with a Turin cloud for Manchester United as Chris Smalling was forced off before the end of the first-half.

His injury curse seemed to strike again when he crumpled under a challenge and was unable to continue.

Michael Carrick came on and Phil Jones curtailed his midfield experiment, which had not been going especially well, and dropped into defence.

Smalling looked groggy as he trudged down the tunnel, but a spokesman from the Football Association said he was unwell, rather than injured.

Manchester United will be hopeful he can be back in action quickly because his form has been excellent recently.

Ahead of the eve of the game, Smalling agreed that he felt as if he was in the form of his career having won the trust of Louis van Gaal at Manchester United.

'The manager has shown a lot of faith in me and especially in these last couple of months,' said Smalling ahead of the game. 'I have stayed fit. The manager has chosen me and I am enjoying my football.
