The BBC licence fee is ‘too high’ and should be decriminalised, its former chairman has admitted.

Michael Grade, who left the corporation in 2006 to lead ITV, said he feels ‘squeamish’ about the fact viewers can be sent to prison for not paying the £145.50 charge.

And although he said he supports the principle of charging all households to watch live TV, he called for it to be reduced when it is comes up for renewal in 2016. 

Former BBC chairman Michael Grade believes non-payment of the licence fee should be decriminalised

Lord Grade told a Royal Television Society debate: ‘I support the licence fee, but I think it is too high. That is a whole other debate, but nevertheless I fully support the licence fee for the next charter period.’

He added: ‘I think the big debate is going to be about the issues of criminality, compulsion and so on. I think we all feel a bit squeamish about the fact you can go to prison if you don’t pay the fine for not paying the licence fee.

‘If there is a way to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee, that would be a good thing.’

Lord Grade first joined the BBC as controller of BBC1 in 1984, and became its director of pro-gramming in 1986. During his time in charge of TV output, he courted controversy by cancelling production of Doctor Who, which he branded ‘awful’ and ‘outdated’.

Lord Grade said the BBC must still be allowed to impose penalties on those who fail to pay the licence fee, otherwise it would open the doors to pre-determined programming

After a stint at Channel 4, he became BBC Chairman for two years and now sits as a Conservative peer in the House of Lords.

Although he called for licence fee evasion to be decriminalised, Lord Grade said the BBC must still be allowed to impose penalties on those who fail to pay.

He said: ‘You have to retain compulsion, otherwise you are opening the way for subscription. Subscription means pre-determined, well-known programming that will be guaranteed to drive subscription. You won’t get Happy Valley. You will be getting whatever they can pick up in the free-market in competition with Sky.’

The Government is currently conducting a year-long review into whether to decriminalise the licence fee

Lord Grade added: ‘If you were inventing the United Kingdom today I think there are three institutions you wouldn’t create in a modern world. I don’t think you would create a hereditary monarchy, I don’t think you would create an unelected second chamber, and I don’t think you would create an organisation like the BBC and organise for it to have £4billion of public funding in an age of media plenty, expansion and so on.

‘But you have to believe that there is something in these three institutions that connects with the British public, and the BBC is one of those institutions that relies for its existence not on political whim, not on political dogma, but on the affection and support of the British public.

‘It faces an incredibly difficult few years coming up, not least with the whole argument about how it should be funded.’

The Government is currently conducting a year-long review into whether to decriminalise the licence fee. It followed a campaign by backbench MPs to scrap the threat of prison sentences for fee evaders.

In 2012, 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying their TV licence, accounting for one in nine of all magistrates court cases.

Most of those found guilty were landed with penalties of up to £1,000 and a criminal record, and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines.
