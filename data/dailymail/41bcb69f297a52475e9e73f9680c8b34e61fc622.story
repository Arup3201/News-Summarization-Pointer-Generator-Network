The Football Association has confirmed it is investigating allegations by Norwich striker Cameron Jerome that he was racially abused by Leeds defender Giuseppe Bellusci.

Jerome complained to referee Mark Clattenburg midway through the first half of the 1-1 draw at Carrow Road on Tuesday night, and the match official is to submit a report to the FA on the incident.

An FA spokesman said: 'I can confirm we are investigating this allegation.'

Clattenburg halted the game midway through the first half after receiving a complaint from Jerome following a verbal clash with his Italian opponent, who signed on a year's loan in August from Catania before agreeing a four-year deal.

The 25-year-old defender was spoken to by the referee, who also addressed both managers on the touchline. Clattenburg then booked Jerome moments later for clattering into the Leeds player

There were no further incidents between the two, but it emerged after the match that Jerome had accused his opponent of making a racist comment.

'Cameron Jerome has alleged he was the subject of a racist remark,' said Norwich manager Neil Adams.

'Because of that Mark Clattenburg, who I felt handled the incident very well, came over to the touchline to explain to (Leeds manager) Darko (Milanic) and myself what I have just told you.

'He spoke to Cameron because of the way he had reacted. That was what he explained to us. He spoke to the players at half-time with a representative from each club and statements have been made now.

'Mark will submit a report to the relevant authorities and it will be dealt with from there. He didn't take any action at the time. He merely relayed what Cameron had said. It must now go through the proper channels.

'Yes, Bellusci is the player who has been alleged to have made the remark.'

Leeds manager Darko Milanic confirmed he would be investigating the matter.

'I have not spoken to my player yet - I will speak to him later,' he said after the match. 'It's difficult for me to comment on something I didn't hear. This is all very new to me.'

Jerome said on Twitter he would not publicly reveal what was said to him but that the FA would deal with it.

He tweeted: 'On what was actually said would not be fair for me to say at this point but it will be a matter for the governing body to deal with.

'As all will know an allegation has been made by myself to the referee in which he made note of and will write it in his match report.'
