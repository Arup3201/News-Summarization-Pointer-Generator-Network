Until yesterday, its most thrilling tweet was 'Our proposal to protect clean water does not change the permitting exemption for farm ponds'.

But it seems staffers at the Environmental Protection Agency have a wild side - after a mystery Kim Kardashian addict linked their iPhone game to the government account.

The EPA's Office of Water stunned its 52,000 followers yesterday when the player announced he or she had become a 'C-list celebrity' on the addictive app.

Everyone's addicted: The Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Water stunned its 52,000 followers yesterday when a mystery player announced he or she was playing Kim Kardashian's smartphone game

The tweet - which said 'I'm now a C-List celebrity in Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. Come join me and become famous too by playing on iPhone!' - was reportedly retweeted 3,000 times before being quietly deleted.

No response has been offered by the EPA, so it is not known whether the account was hacked or a staff member was playing on taxpayers' time.

But that didn't stop a wave of amusement on the social networking site, where users adored - or feared - the idea of stern bureaucrats secretly trying to become celebs.

Michigan congressman John Dingell wrote: 'I'm
 the last original author of the Clean Water Act, but I have no idea 
who/what a Kardashian is and I rarely play games. You OK, @EPAwater?'

Addictive: The game shot to number two in the U.S. iPhone app chart and is set to net Kim £40m this year

Young San 
Diego Republican activist Eli Rubenstein ‏was more scathing, saying: 
'Glad to know @EPAwater employees (paid by taxpayers) are hard at work 
playing Kim Kardashian games on their iPhones.'

Twitter user Keely Galgano said it was 'in the running for best twitter mishap ever' while BuzzFeed journalist Adrian Carrasquillo put it quite simply: 'We had a good run, humanity'.

Launched by Glu Mobile earlier this month, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood has been a runaway hit with a report by Bloomberg suggesting it could net the star more than $40million this year.

Despite mixed reviews it took the number two spot in the U.S. iPhone app download chart as Kardashian fans became glued to their phones.

Dry: How the @EPAwater Twitter account usually looks - with no references to the Kardashians at all

Players 
have to build a celebrity profile for themselves by choosing their 
wardrobe, dating and dumping other celebs and posing for the paparazzi -
 with Kim's help, of course.

Whoever was playing the game at the EPA will be pleased to know 'C-List' is halfway up the game's rankings, which rate players from E-lister to A-lister.

But for now, they'll have to quietly get back to tweeting about algal blooms and low-mercury fish.
