Ravi Shastri has been appointed India's director of cricket for the One Day International Royal London Series against England which gets under way next week.

The former India captain and all-rounder comes into the role following a succession of one-sided defeats by England in the Test series, but Duncan Fletcher remains head coach.

A statement from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said: 'In culmination of the discussions among all the office bearers of BCCI over the last couple of weeks, the BCCI has decided to avail the services of former India captain, Mr Ravi Shastri to oversee and guide the Indian cricket team for the forthcoming one day international matches against England.

'Mr Duncan Fletcher will continue as head coach while Ravi Shastri will be the overall in- charge of cricket affairs of the Indian Team.

'In their continuing efforts to re-energise the support to the team, the BCCI has given a break to the bowling coach Mr Joe Dawes and the fielding coach, Mr Trevor Penny for the one day series and appointed Mr Sanjay Bangar, former Indian all rounder and former India fast bowler Mr Bharat Arun as the assistant coaches of the team.

'Mr R Sridhar will join the support team as the fielding coach for the one day series.'

It is not the first time that Shastri has been called upon in a time of crisis, as he was named India's cricket manager following their disastrous first-round exit from the 2007 World Cup.

India face England in Bristol on Monday in the first of five ODIs.
