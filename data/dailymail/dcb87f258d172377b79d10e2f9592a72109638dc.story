Snow is well known to cause havoc to the UK's transport network, and often leads to foreign visitors sniggering at our failure to cope with the white stuff.

And after watching this incredible video shot in Canada, it may leave us even more sheepish.

A freight train shows no sign of stopping as it ploughs through thick snow and gives the person taking the video a shower of avalanche proportions. 

The train ploughs through a mound of snow showing that whatever the weather, the show must go on

The person videoing the action is showered with a huge snow cloud as the train crashes past

Southern New Brunswick was hit with three major blizzards in less than a week, and there is more snow in the forecast.

But that is met head on by the driver of this train in spectacular fashion. 

The Canadian National Railway locomotive 2304 (ES44DC) plowed through huge snow drifts  as it leads the daily CN manifest train 406 West.

As well as the track being completely covered with high snow, the windscreen at the front of the train is also all blocked up.

Canada is well used to heavy snow, and as the driver of this train proves, it's all part of the day job

The extent of the depth of snow is portrayed brilliant in this show - how the driver sees is anyone's guess

And at this point, you'd be hard pressed to even guess there was a train approaching

Freezing rain on top of snow has draped much of Canada under a sheet of ice, making driving impossible. Minor accidents have been reported all over the country.

Hundreds of thousands in Quebec province have been without electricity.

In most major Canadian and northern US cities, temperatures hovered around -20 degrees Celsius, but with a windchill felt like -45 degrees Celsius in some parts, according to meteorologists.

At these temperatures, exposed skin can freeze in under two minutes.
