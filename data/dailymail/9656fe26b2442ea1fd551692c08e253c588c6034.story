Since AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd's controversial arrest, local businesses in his adopted home of Tauranga have resorted to taping messages on the door of his personal airport hangar to contact him for money owed.

The Australian-born musician has hardly been sighted in the city, 200km south-east of Auckland in New Zealand, after he was granted bail on Thursday under the condition he stay at his waterfront home until his next court appearance for allegedly threatening to kill a man.

When Rudd is not at home he is often seen at his two-storey hangar at Tauranga Airport where he stores his arsenal of luxury cars and helicopters.

The place also includes living quarters hooked up to cable television. 

At the back of the hangar, a black Western Star truck - which the racing enthusiast uses to transport his supercars - is parked outside.

Phil Rudd is being chased for money by a business who resorted to putting a note on his hangar door

A note is on the AC/DC drummer's hangar door at Tauranga Airport from a company asking him to pay $192.00

It has been estimated the total amount of Rudd's 11 cars - which include a 1991 Ferrari F40, two Lamborghinis and Bentleys, a Rolls Royce Ghost and an Audi R8 - are worth up to $3 million, stuff.co.nz reported.

Neighbours of Rudd's hangar said they often saw the reclusive rocker at his second home.

'We see him once a week. I've walked passed a couple times where the hangar door is open... and you glance inside and there are cars everywhere,' one man - who did not wish to be named - told Daily Mail Australia.

'There's a car that's parked outside which hasn't moved in 18 months, a Ferrari, there's a big racing car truck and a helicopter.'

But on Monday the hangar looked almost abandoned with wheelie bins and empty fuel drums sitting outside.

Tinted windows and blinds prevent people from looking in, and a note that read 'Phil Rudd, Please pay... $192.00...' was taped on the door.

When Daily Mail Australia approached the business who left the note, a woman sitting at the front desk said she did not want to get involved.

But it is understood the money is owed for a 'personal matter' and it was the only way the business could contact Rudd since his arrest.
