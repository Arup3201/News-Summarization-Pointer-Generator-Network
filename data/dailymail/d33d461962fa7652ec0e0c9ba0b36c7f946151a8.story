The 'lost city of Atlantis has eluded explorers for centuries and is almost certainly the stuff of myth.

Staggeringly, though, an ancient city that is Atlantis in all  but name has emerged from under the sea near Alexandria — and now the  lost world of Heracleion is giving up  its treasures.

Just as in the classical tale, Heracleion was once a prosperous, thriving city before it was engulfed by the sea around 1,500 years ago. It was grand enough to be mentioned by the Greek writer Herodotus, the 5th-century BC historian.

He told the fabulous story of Helen of Troy, the most beautiful woman in the world — she of the face that launched a thousand ships — travelling to Heracleion, then a port of ‘great wealth’, with her glamorous Trojan lover, Paris.

Among the most important monuments that were discovered at the temple area of Thonis-Heracleion is this monolithic chapel dating to the Ptolemaic period

But no physical evidence of such a 
grand settlement appeared until 2001, when a group led by French marine 
archaeologist Franck Goddio stumbled upon some relics that led them to 
one of the greatest finds of the 21st century.

Goddio was in search of Napoleon’s 
warships from the 1798 Battle of the Nile, when he was defeated by 
Nelson in these very waters, but came upon this much more significant 
discovery.

Goddio’s team has since been joined by
 the Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology and the Department of 
Antiquities of Egypt to produce a wealth of dazzling finds.

The archaeologists first faced the 
mammoth task of reassembling massive stone fragments on the seabed 
before they could haul them to the surface. Twelve years on, their 
fabulous finds have been exposed to public view for the first time after
 more than a millennium spent beneath the silt and water of Aboukir Bay,
 20 miles north-east of Alexandria.

Among the discoveries are colossal 
statues of the Egyptian goddess Isis, the god Hapi, and an unidentified 
Egyptian pharaoh — all preserved in immaculate condition by their muddy 
burial shroud. Along with these 16ft statues there are hundreds of 
smaller statues of Egyptian gods — among them the figures that guarded 
the temple where Cleopatra was inaugurated as Queen of the Nile.

It seems the Amun-Gereb temple at 
Heracleion was the Egyptian equivalent of Westminster Abbey, where our 
own Queen was crowned 60 years ago.

Dozens of sarcophagi have been found, 
containing the bodies of mummified animals sacrificed to Amun-Gereb, the
 supreme god of the Egyptians. Many amulets, or religious charms, have 
been unearthed, too, showing gods such as Isis, Osiris and Horus.

These were made not just for the 
Egyptians but for visiting traders, who incorporated them into their own
 religions and also, one imagines, kept them as trinkets to remind them 
of their far-flung journeys.

The importance of Heracleion has been 
further proved by the discovery of 64 ships — the largest number of 
ancient vessels ever found in one place — and a mind-boggling 700 
anchors.

Other finds illustrate how crucial 
Heracleion was to the economy of the ancient world. Gold coins and lead,
 bronze and stone weights from Athens (used to measure the value of 
goods and to calculate the tax owed) show that Heracleion was a 
lucrative Mediterranean trading post.

Heracleion was mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus, who told of Helen of Troy visiting the city with her lover Paris before the Trojan war

In the ancient world, the 
Mediterranean Sea was their equivalent of a superfast motorway. All 
their greatest cities, including Constantinople, Rome and Athens, were 
either on the coast or on rivers with easy access to it.

And now Heracleion can be added to 
their number as Egypt’s most important port during the time of the later
 pharaohs. It was, if you like, a major motorway junction — the spot 
where the Nile, Egypt’s lifeline, met the Med. Archaeologists have 
determined that as well as having a naturally navigable channel next to 
its ancient harbour, a further artificial channel appears to have been 
dug to expedite trade.

The Heracleion finds will add 
tremendous depth to our understanding of the ancient world — not least 
because, among the discoveries, there are perfectly preserved steles 
(inscribed pillars) decorated with hieroglyphics. Translated, they will 
reveal much about the religious and political life in this corner of 
ancient Egypt.

It was a similar inscription on the 
Rosetta Stone — discovered in the Nile Delta town of Rosetta in 1799 by a
 French soldier, and now in the British Museum — that cracked the code 
of hieroglyphics in the first place.

And like the Rosetta Stone, those 
steles found beneath the waters of Aboukir Bay are inscribed in Greek 
and Egyptian, too. Who knows how many more archaeological gems will be 
uncovered at Heracleion?

The very name of the city is taken 
from that most famous of Greek heroes, Heracles — aka Hercules — whose 
12 labours, from killing the  Hydra  to capturing Cerberus, the 
multi-headed hellhound that guarded the gates of the Underworld, 
captivated the ancient world.

Heraklion, Crete’s capital and largest
 city, is also named after Heracles, as was Herculaneum, the ancient 
Roman town that was buried under ash when Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD.

It appears that Heracleion faded in 
importance in the later classical period, eclipsed by its neighbouring 
city of Alexandria, which became the capital of Egypt in 312BC.

Still, Heracleion lingered on, later 
under Roman control, until it slipped into its watery grave some time in
 the 6th or 7th century AD. What a thrilling discovery we have on our 
hands now that the sea has, 1,500 years later, given up one of its 
greatest secrets.

Items including 16ft sculptures, gold coins and giant tablets are among some of the objects recovered from the ancient port city

One theory suggests a rise in sea level and unstable collapsing sediment combined to submerge the city
