'If you start hitting people in the head with a shovel, it can lead to death,' Major Steve Lord of the Miami County Sheriff's Office told WHIO-TV.

Notably, Olinger - who admitted to WHIO that she threw the shovel - faces the same charges as Fugate.

The girls told the TV station that the fight had been brewing for a long time - and that it was over a boy.

Olinger said she felt justified in throwing the shovel.

''I told her to leave again, and she refused, so then the first thing I saw was my shovel. I picked it up and then she said, "OK, OK" and by the time she said she was done, I already hit her with it,' the teen told WHIO.

'I've been bullied ever since I was in the fourth grade, and that's why I hit her with the shovel because I'm tired of it.'

As the video quickly spread online, with some dubbing it 'the best fight ever', an obviously-fake news story that Fugate had died as a result of the hit proliferated just as fast.

'Miranda Fugate died of serious head injuries after being hit with a shovel in the head by an old friend of hers named Emily Powers,' the story, which first appeared on curious website Huzlers, said.

'At first, It only seemed like a minor head injury as Miranda also temporarily lost one ear's hearing.

'Suddenly, while watching Mean Girls at home that same day, Miranda collapsed and died instantly.

'Doctors are saying she died of severe head trauma.'

Fugate soon took to Twitter to announce she was alive and well, posting: 'I'M THE GIRL that got hit in the head with the shovel lol ... ya'll made me famous for getting hurt LMAO.'

Online murmurings said the scuffle started 'over a boy'.

The original video, which is available on YouTube but contains explicit language, has got hundreds of thousands of hits, as have numerous of other edited ones that have been uploaded.

The girl's go for numerous rounds of slapping and kicking each other before the grand shovel finale, exchanging colorful dialogue in-between.

'I think I just broke my hand with your face, dude,' Fugate says at one point.

'I got a hard a-- head,' Powers replies.

'I can tell,' Fugate hits back.

After the fiery red-head gets knocked down, she scurries away to a nearby bush with her friends, saying she can't hear out of one ear.

'I beat her a-- though, so it's OK,' Fugate says, with the video cutting shortly after.
