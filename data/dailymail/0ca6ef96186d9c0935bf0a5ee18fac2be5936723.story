Hundreds of mourners gathered today to pay tribute to fun-loving TV chef Clarissa Dickson Wright - whose coffin was decorated with her favourite cooking ingredients.

The 66-year-old, who died in Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary last month, became a much-loved figure as she toured the UK in the sidecar of Jennifer Paterson's motorbike, as part of their television show, Two Fat Ladies.

Family and friends gathered in the city's St 
Mary's Metropolitan Cathedral, where her coffin bore a 
wreath made from red chillies, 
sage, broccoli, cardamom and artichokes.

The chef died on March 15 but had been in the hospital since the beginning of 2014. The cause of death has 
not been made public.

Catholic celebrant, The Very Rev 
Monsignor Michael Regan, said: 'Clarissa was a woman of contradictions 
who was a believing Catholic, who as she said herself was "bolshy from 
the beginning".

'Her life was a life of contrasts, of incredible wealth and incredible poverty.

'She
 has influenced so many people and we are here to give thanks, but also 
to pray for her, because as a catholic she wanted the prayers of the 
community.

'She
 will be remembered as a larger than life, colourful figure who 
contributed to so many lives and touched so many people in different 
ways.

'She
 will be remembered fondly by vast numbers of people, some of whom only 
knew her through the television, some knew her from her London life and 
some who knew her from her from her Edinburgh life.'

The
 90-minute service included a Horn Concerto by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 
an Entrance Hymn by Sydney Carter, Psalm 23, The Offertory Hymn by Cecil
 Frances Alexander and a Communion Hymn by John Greenleaf Whittier.

The service took place in Edinburgh's St Mary's Metropolitan Cathedral and was attended by family and friends

Miss Dickson Wright's friend Morag MacKay performed the 1930s ballad 'A Nightingale Sang in 
Berkeley Square' and Sally Merison recited Home is the Sailor by A. E. 
Houseman.

A recovering alcoholic, Miss Dickson Wright, who died in Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary last month, would have celebrated 27 years of sobriety this week.

The Very Rev Monsignor Regan told mourners: 'Through her education and upbringing she proved herself to be a brilliant woman and her career seemed destined for greatness but she had the self-destruct mechanism of so many gifted people and her downward spiral is well-known.

'But from that downward spiral where she found herself homeless and penniless she learned a sympathy with others that stayed with her and through her association with Alcoholics Anonymous she found and gave strength to others.'

Clarissa was born in 1947 in St John's Wood, London, as the youngest of four children to Molly and Arthur Dickson Wright, who was a surgeon to the Royal Family.

She attended Sacred Heart School in Tunbridge, Kent, and went on to study for the Bar at Gray's Inn while she pursued a law degree at the University College London.

At just 21 years of age, she passed the Bar and became England's youngest barrister.

She was an active campaigner for the Countryside Alliance on rural issues

But, after the death of her parents, Miss Dickson Wright fell victim to depression and alcohol addiction, which put an end to her legal career.

Marah Dickson Wright, the chef's sister-in law, said: 'I think she will be remembered with great humour.

'She was very, very clever and intelligent and funny - just a wonderful human being. Everybody will miss her greatly.

'Her sobriety was an absolutely fantastic achievement. I remember taking her into the drying-out place and on 10 April it would have been 27 years.

'Every year on that date she rang me up to say thank you from anywhere in the world.

'She hardly had enemies and if she did, they made it up in a moment or two.'

Clarissa went on to become a cook and worked at the Books for Cooks shop in Notting Hill, London, before managing the Cooks Books shop in Edinburgh, where she found TV fame.

From 1994, she starred in the successful Two Fat Ladies series, where she cooked feasts while touring the country in a motorbike's sidecar.

The show was broadcast around the world, but came to an end during its fourth series following the death of colleague Jennifer Paterson in 1999.

Clarissa then went to live in the coach house of plush Manor House close to her family in Inveresk, East Lothian, and starred in several more TV programmes and documentaries.

She campaigned for the Countryside Alliance and also became the first female rector of the University of Aberdeen, which said it was 'saddened' to hear of her death.

The coffin was carried out of the cathedral to the tune of My Home and Mist-covered Mountain, before her family and friends attended a private cremation

Edward Armitage, Miss Dickson Wight's nephew, said: 'Clarissa was an enormous ally of mine and great fun.

'She was one of the greatest human beings that walked the planet and influenced so many people into recovery from various forms of addiction. She will hugely missed by many people.'

Professor David Casson, a friend and member of Gray's Inn, said: 'I remember Clarissa as a very old friend.

'She was a remarkable personality and someone who enlivened every occasion at which she was present.

'She was an extraordinarily able and intelligent woman with many, many qualities.

'Her career started as a young barrister, where she was a well-known and prominent figure at among the junior bar at Gray's Inn.

'She was known, from very early days, to be a very sociable person who lived entertaining her friends and colleagues.

'She was much admired and often the centre of attraction. At this early stage, we are clearly mourning, that is inevitable, but we are also celebrating the remarkable life of a remarkable person.'

A lone piper then played her coffin out of the cathedral to the tune of My Home and Mist-covered Mountain, before her family and friends attended a private cremation.

A collection was taken for local charities campaigning on issues of alcohol dependence and homelessness.
