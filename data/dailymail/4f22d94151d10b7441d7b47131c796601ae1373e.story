A great white shark heading for British waters could be bringing some smaller ferocious fish with her, scientists have revealed.

The deadly predator – named Lydia – became the first tagged great white shark to cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and scientists charting her progress have now revealed that the 15ft shark might be swimming towards Europe to give birth to pups.

She is just 800 miles (1,255km) off the coast of Cornwall and Ireland in the Atlantic Ocean and has now turned away from the UK.

Very little is known about the reproduction of great white sharks.

Great white sharks are thought to reach sexual maturity aged around 15. The oldest female ever recorded was 40 years old.

The predators are ovoviviparous which means that eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth.

The great white shark has an 11 month gestation period and the pups' jaws start to form at one month.

Unborn sharks feed on ova produced by the mother and are born in spring and summer.

Mother sharks typically give birth to between two and 12 pups.

But experts think she may be aiming for Turkey in search of a nursery in the long-run.

Lydia, who weighs 2,000lb (907kg) has covered more than 19,400 miles in the past year since being fitted with a tracking device.

She is being tracked as part of a ground-breaking marine life study by Osearch that aims to learn more about sharks' movements.

Scientists have been following the ferocious fish for over a year and her progress can be followed on the project’s website.

‘Lydia pinged in this morning headed NW!’ researchers tweeted this morning.

Experts say they are shocked by Lydia’s recent dash towards Europe and she has travelled 313 miles in the past 72 hours.

Chris Fischer, expedition leader and founding chairman of the Ocearch shark tagging project, said Lydia may be looking for somewhere to rear young.

He said: ‘I would guess that Lydia is pregnant and that she has been out in the open ocean gestating her babies and that this spring she will lead us to where those baby white sharks are born - the nursery.’

He thinks her chosen location may end up being off the coast of Turkey.

Deadly cargo: Tagging the shark (pictured) was a feat in itself, with heavy machinery used to hoist Lydia from the water in order to fit the tracking device

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a ridge found along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.

This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, erupting as lava and producing new crustal material for the plates.

It forms part of the longest mountain range in the world and separates the Eurasian Plate and North American Plate in the North Atlantic, and the African Plate from the South American Plate in the South Atlantic.

Great White Sharks normally give birth to between two and 12 pups at a time after a gestation period of 11 months.

Blood samples didn't show Lydia was pregnant when researchers used a 34,000kg hydraulic platform to hoist her from the water to fit her tracking device.

But Mr Fischer, who has led numerous ocean expeditions, said there is uncertainty over how exactly Great Whites reproduce.

‘The sperm from the male comes in a packet with a shell on it. They [the female sharks] can carry it around for a while until a special organ inside them breaks down the shell and they get pregnant.

‘We know its 18 months from when we discover the breeding aggregation to when they lead us to the nursery.

‘What we don't know is how long they carry that sperm packet and how long is it until their body breaks down the shell.’

Lydia had been heading north but made a sharp turn back towards the U.S.

Ladbrokes bookkeepers revealed odds of 2-1 for Lydia visiting Cornwall as her first port of call.

Lydia has become the first tagged great white to cross the Mid Atlantic Ridge (pictured) - an underwater mountain range which separates the Eurasian and North American Plates - at around 10am on March 9

Her GPS tag only gives off a signal when she's near the water's surface so scientists sometimes have to wait days between new readings.

Mr Fischer said it was impossible to predict where she'll head next.

He said: ‘If you forced me to guess where that was, I'd say it was over in the Mediterranean, near Turkey - but that's long-ball I'm playing.

‘She could turn around right now and head back to Florida.’

She became the first tagged great white to cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - an underwater mountain range which separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates - on the morning of March 9.

Great whites are traditionally tracked off the coasts of South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the west coast of America from California up to Alaska, the Gulf coast and Hawaii.

Shark biologist Ian Fergusson tweeted: ‘WhiteShark Lydia pinged in on the other side of MidAtlanticRidge! Welcome to the history books, #Lydia,’ while Chris Fischer, who is involved in the project, tweeted: '#Lydia turns E toward #UK continuing first doc Trans/Atl migration n hist!’

Lydia was tagged by the Ocearch project, which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their movements

Dr Gregory Skomal, 52, senior fisheries biologist with Massachusetts Marine Fisheries, said: ‘I have no idea what to expect from her 
next. I've been working with sharks for a very long time now and I have 
never seen anything like this.'

‘It's anyone's guess where she is going to go next but she has been heading east so she might continue to do so.’

‘She's just short of 800 miles away from your coast now but in the grand scheme of things that really isn't far for her. It's all very exciting.

‘It's hard to say how long it might take her to get there. If she decides she wants to get to England she could get there in days.

‘Having said that, she is quite likely to meander. It could take her days, it could take her months, or it might not happen at all.

‘I think it would be great to see her turn up in the UK though.’

Though Lydia's journey is impressive, great whites are known for their marathon migrations.

In 2003 a great white nicknamed Nicole travelled from South Africa to Australia and back - some 12,400 miles.

In recent years there have been several sightings of Great whites off the coast of Britain.

In September last year, fisherman David Bond said he had spotted a 14ft beast swimming close to his boat off the coast of Looe in southern Cornwall.

The suspected sighting came just a day after a fisherman on board a lobster boat said he spotted a 'giant shark' get close to his vessel.

All those who witnessed the shark dismissed the idea it could be a basking shark, saying the creature was much larger, prompting experts to consider the possibility it was a great white.

Great white sharks are the largest predatory fish in the world, reaching up to 20ft in length and more than 4,400lb in weight.

Satellite tracking of the giant species has afforded researchers and scientists more accurate information about their habits and long-distance journeys.

The OCEARCH Global Shark Tracker Project has tagged around 100 sharks since 2009.

The study has shown that Great whites can travel up to 3,000 miles in three months.

They
 are traditionally tracked off the coasts of South Africa, Australia, 
New Zealand, the west coast of America from California up to Alaska, the
 Gulf coast and Hawaii.

The 
creatures have a ferocious reputation but are responsible for between a
 third and a half of the average 100 shark attacks across the world each
 year.

They are highly adapted predators, detecting a single drop of blood in 100 litres of water up to three miles away.

Their mouths are lined with around 300 serrated teeth, arranged across several rows.

Gathering
 speed and approaching their prey from beneath, Great whites can leap 
clear of the water, breaching like whales to attack.

They commonly feed on sea lions, seals, small toothed whales, and sea turtles.

The predators live for up to 25 years and eat around 11 tonnes of food each year.

If food is scarce, the sharks will try to avoid fighting, instead engaging in a tail-slapping contest along the surface of the water. The winner delivers the most slaps.

Scientists
 do not have a reliable idea of the species' population across the 
world, but agree their number are decreasing due to overfishing and 
sharks being caught accidentally in nets.

They are listed as an endangered species.

No one understands why she is taking such a strange route as great whites are usually found in warmer waters
