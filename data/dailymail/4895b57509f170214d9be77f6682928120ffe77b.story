A man stepped in to tell residents in an apartment building that it was on fire and guide them to safety.

ABC7 reported the individual is called 'Robin Hood 702' because he donates his prize money from Las Vegas casinos to help people. Las Vegas is under the 702 area code. 

'It looked like the roof was ready to catch fire, so I figured I had to act, and uh, jumped out [of my car] and ran up these steps here. As I got toward the step I heard a guy screaming,' he told the affiliate station.

ABC7 reported he grabbed a burning piece of wood so the apartment dwellers could flee and also knocked on doors. 

'Robin Hood 702' told the affiliate station 'Could have been a lot worse - for everybody, you know, so thank goodness that the people that live in this apartment complex rallied around [to help with firefighting efforts].'

He told ABC News 'There was a guy screaming who said he couldn't get out. I shouted to call 911 and I was screaming for a garden hose.'

He told the news station apartment dwellers assisted and 'I kept screaming "Buddy, I’m going to get you out of here." I grabbed him out of the doorway and walked him down the steps and by the time I hit the bottom of the steps four to five fire trucks showed up.'

He also said to ABC7 he is 'keeping the spotlight on the act and what I do is far greater than who I am, cause I'm a nobody. I'm just a regular guy trying to do extraordinary things.

'So I'm hoping that message gets out there and I'm hoping it inspires people.'

Building resident Douglass Cobb told ABC7 'Robin Hood 702' is 'Superman right here. Robin Hood gives back to the poor, but he saved everybody's life here, so.'

'God bless that man cause, yeah, it could have been ugly,' Cobb also told the station.
