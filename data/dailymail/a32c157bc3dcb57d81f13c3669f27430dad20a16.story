Poppy the tiny hare must be very confused as she recovers from a broken leg at an animal sanctuary.

A dog attack in a Surrey field killed her brothers and sisters and has left her an orphan - bad doggie.

But just as Poppy, as she has been named by rescue centre staff, faced death a second dog appeared on the scene.

Trooper: Poppy is recovering from the broken leg she suffered during her ordeal with a tiny cast to help it heal

The lurcher scooped little Poppy up in its jaw and whisked her away from danger, taking the tiny hare to its master - good doggie.

As Poppy recovers from her ordeal, and the broken leg suffered during her rescue, she has been making lots of new friends.

Despite wearing a splint that slows her down Poppy has become close to Betty the badger who is also a rescued orphan.

Queen guitarist Brian May, founder of conservation group Save Me, met Poppy when she was brought Harper Asprey Wildlife Rescue's centre in Camberley, Surrey.Â 

He said: 'She has a feisty spirit and I'm sure she'll recover and be OK.'

She has begun feeding through a syringe 
and it is hoped she will be fit enough to be released into the wild by 
the end of the summer.

Loveable: Rescue centre staff have been giving Poppy lots of help to prepare her for release back into the wild
