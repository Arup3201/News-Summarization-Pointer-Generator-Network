Indian broadcast journalist Rajesh Verma of news channel IBN 7 was shot in the chest while covering a communal demonstration in Abupura, and died at the scene.

Uttar Pradesh was at the heart of some of India's worst communal clashes in December 1992, after a Hindu mob razed the 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya.

The government has warned that India is seeing a rise in communal violence, with 451 incidents reported already this year, compared with 410 for all of 2012.

In August alone, communal violence killed two and injured 22 in a village in Bihar state, east of Uttar Pradesh, according to Indian media. Outbreaks have also been reported recently in Uttar Pradesh's district of Shamli, as well as in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
