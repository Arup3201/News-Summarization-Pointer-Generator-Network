A Polish mother and stepfather who murdered her four-year-old son using 'unimaginable acts of cruelty and brutality' have lost an appeal against their 30-year prison sentences.

'Callous and wretched' Magdalena Luczak, 27, and  Mariusz Krezolek, 34, killed Daniel Pelka after they force-fed him salt, beat him and locked him in a tiny room in a 13-month campaign of torture.

The couple, jailed for life in August last year, claimed their sentences were 'excessive' but a legal challenge was thrown out by the Court of Appeal today.

'Callous and wretched': Magdalena Luczak, 27, and Mariusz Krezolek, 34, killed her son Daniel Pelka after they tortured him and locked him in a tiny room - but they claimed their 30-year sentences were 'excessive'

Shocking: The murder of four-year-old Daniel Pelka was described as one of the worst to ever come before the British courts

Three judges in London also rejected a bid by Mariusz Krezolek to appeal against his murder conviction - describing his application as 'unarguable'. 

Lady Justice Hallett, announcing the decision of the court today, said the trial judge was 'fully entitled to treat this as one of the most serious offences of murder to come before the courts'.

She described the story of Daniel's suffering and death as 'heartbreaking'. 

Daniel Pelka suffered ‘chronic and systematic’ starvation, which stopped him growing and left him a ‘bag of bones’. She added: ‘He was literally wasting away.’

He weighed less than a toddler and stood six inches smaller than average when he died a few months short of his fifth birthday with at least 30 injuries to his emaciated body.

Krezolek beat Daniel around the head and then the couple left him to die alone on March 3, 2012, even having sex as he lay unconscious. 

THe judge in their murder trial said: 'Harrowing details of the unimaginable acts of cruelty and brutality inflicted on little Daniel, over many months, have exposed both the torment and despair he must have suffered and your callous disregard for his pain and distress'. 

A Serious Case Review into the death found Daniel was effectively ‘invisible’ to officials in Coventry, who failed to speak to the Polish child about a home life in which he was starved, poisoned with salt and held in a bath until he passed out.

Police were called to his home 27 times in his short life as his drunk mother got into violent rows with various lovers, often with the schoolboy watching.

Before his death Daniel resembled a ‘concentration camp victim’, weighed just 11kg and was so hungry teachers saw him eating food from bins and the school sandpit.

The report concluded 'at no point were practitioners who had contact with him prepared to think the unthinkable and consider that he might be suffering abuse'.

Luczak’s minimum term of 30 years is one of the longest jail terms given to a woman in Britain. It is the same as child-killer Beverley Allitt and is exceeded by only Rose West and Myra Hindley.

Convicted killers: Magdelena Luczak, Daniel's mother, and his stepfather Mariusz Krezolek who were found guilty of murder by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court. Krezolek failed to get that overturned

Prison: The tiny unfurnished box room that Daniel was locked in for hours on end. The door had been tampered with so Daniel could not get out

Filthy: A dirty mattress Daniel Pelka was forced to sleep on during his confinement in the box room in his home in Coventry

Murdered schoolboy: The catalogue of injuries inflicted on little Daniel Pelka, which were found when his body was examined

Yet at the time not one professional who came into contact with Daniel and his mother and stepfather from his school, social services, the NHS or the police has been disciplined.

Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Mr Justice Popplewell and Mr Justice Edis, said Daniel was subjected in the months before his death to a campaign of escalating cruelty including starvation.

'That anyone could treat a child this way is incomprehensible. That his mother and stepfather could is beyond any belief and understanding.' 

'In the context of weeks, if not months, of sustained cruelty designed to cause suffering to a four-year-old child, culminating in that child's death, in our judgment, a lack of intention to kill adds very little by way of mitigation.'

It was not a case where a child died as a result of one blow, because of an unexpected burst of anger by an uncaring parent, but where there was at least one final fatal bow to an already 'dreadfully abused and neglected child'.

Even after that blow was administered, help was not sought until it was far too late, said the judge.

'Both applicants were plainly far more concerned about their own future and their own responsibility than about getting help to a dying child.

'This was an extraordinarily serious case of its type and, in our view, clearly justified the impositon of a very long minimum term.

'That is what they received, and we do not find that the sentence was in any way excessive.'
