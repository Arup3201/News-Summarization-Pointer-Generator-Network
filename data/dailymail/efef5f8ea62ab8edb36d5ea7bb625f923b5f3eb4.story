Mario John Lopez, 26 (pictured), robbed a bride and groom on their wedding day this week. He was arrested a day later by Broward County, Florida police

Like many couples, Nathan Brooks and Julia Martinez couldn't sleep the night before their wedding - though not for nerves. 

The couple spent the whole night filing police reports and going to the hospital after being attacked by a robber in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 

As a sign of their commitment, the attack did not delay their wedding despite the newlyweds having to post for pictures with bruised faces.

'We didn't let this stop us from getting married. We're happy. Our wedding was fantastic,' Mr Brooks, 26, told the Sun-Sentinel. 

The groom was returning to his hotel from Tropic Cay Sports Bar just after 3am on Monday when he was approached by a man on the street who robbed him at gunpoint. 

'I just saw the gun and I said, "Take whatever you want," and he started beating me,' Mr Brooks recalled. 

The robber hit the groom in the face with his gun, knocking him over and beat Mr Brooks as he lay on the ground. All the while he sifted through Mr Brooks' pockets, stealing cash and a cellphone.

Worried about her soon-to-be husband's whereabouts, 33-year-old bride Julia Martinez and mother of the groom Sherrie Geisler, 51, went outside to search for Mr Brooks and found him in the street.

They also came upon the robber, who pointed  his gun at the bride who pleaded for her life. 

That move led Geisler to jump on the gunman, who went on to pistol whip both women, stealing their cash and another cellphone. 

'Luckily everyone survived,' Mr Brooks said. 

While both women refused treatment for their injuries, the groom was taken to Broward Health Medical Center where he was treated for stitches. He also came away from the fight with a broken nose, two black eyes, a chipped tooth, scrapes and bruises.  

Nathan Brooks was returning from a sports bar at this Fort Lauderdale hotel the morning of his wedding when he encountered Lopez and was beaten 

He was released from the hospital around 10am that morning, and returned to his hotel to get ready for his 3:30pm wedding at the Coral Gables courthouse. 

After the ceremony, the wedding party went to the Atlantic Hotel for a dinner reception.

'Me and my family and my wife and my friends — besides the injuries and being sore and getting beat up — at the end of the day, we had a great time,' Mr Brooks said. 'The ceremony was excellent. The photos are the only downside.' 

Investigators identified the robber as Mario John Lopez, 26, who they were able to track down the following day. 

Around 9:30pm on Tuesday, officers spotted Lopez in Davie, Florida, and he fled into a field in an attempt to evade arrest. 

Officers sent a police dog after the robber, who choked the dog until police were able to separate the two. The dog survived the attack and is now recovering.

Lopez was arrested and charged with three robberies with a firearm, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and resisting arrest with violence and battery on a police dog. 

He was denied bail at a Wednesday afternoon hearing, the same day Mr and Mrs Brooks set sail on their Bahamas cruise honeymoon. 

'They got the guy. That's the most important thing,' Mr Brooks said. 'One bad guy is off the streets. I'm glad they got him. At least he doesn't have the opportunity to kill someone or do this to someone else.'
