A teenage boy who suffered horrific 60 per cent burns when a fire ripped through his family's home has fought back after defying doctors' predictions.

Nathaniel Smith is now a healthy 13-year-old after undergoing countless skin graft operations over the last seven-and-a-half years.

The schoolboy's parents Marika and Chris were warned that he could die within hours after the fire in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in May 2006.

He is now near the top of the class in school, and planning to take his A-levels in the future - despite being forced to miss classes in the past because of his condition.

Nathaniel has now gone almost two years without a skin graft operation.

Speaking for the first time about the blaze, he said: 'I think about how I could have died and how I am very lucky but I do not let anything hold me back.

'No one has ever said anything bad to me about it so I have had a lot of support from people and that's helped me.

'I just want to be like every other teenager out there.'

Nathaniel, now a year 9 pupil in Gateshead, spent months in a specialist burns unit while doctors fought to save his life following the accidental fire caused by a candle.

His parents Marika and Chris and siblings Corrina, 18, and Andre, 16, have supported him as he made his recovery.

His mother, 48, said: 'That first night when I said "what's the prognosis?" they said he could last two hours, two days, two weeks or two months, anything could happen.

'Throughout that following year when he was in hospital we would think he was getting better then he would get another infection and would be life-threateningly ill.

'I remember saying to a doctor, "Will he be all right?", and the doctor just said, "I don't know, he might not be. It seems he is healing but he is not out of the woods".

'It used to be we would take one step forward then two back, it was just a roller coaster.'

Since the fire the family have lost count of the number of operations Nathaniel has had to endure, and his battle is not over yet.

'Because the operations were so intense the doctors decided it would only be over the next couple of years if it was essential,' said Marika, who admitted she still gets flashbacks to the night of the fire.

'More operations are in the pipeline as and when he needs them. He has a lot of operations still to come and he needs his nose rebuilding, reconstructive surgery.'

But looking at her son today Marika said she can not believe how far he has come.

'I did not think we would see him get to this age because of the injuries, you could never see that far into the future, you could not imagine what years down the line would be like,' she said.

'If someone told me seven years ago he would be fine and doing really well at school I do not know what I would have thought,' added Marika, of Low Fell in Gateshead.

Nathaniel has been doing particularly well in science, she said.

Paying tribute to her son's strength of character Marika added: 'He has never once said, "Why me?", he does not feel sorry for himself or want special treatment, he wants to be a normal 13-year-old boy. He sees himself as a typical teenager who happens to have been in a fire.'

And Nathaniel does not let his past stop him doing anything. Last summer he travelled to Mexico with a school friend and his family despite having to take extra precautions exposing his burns to the high temperature.

He also enjoys playing basketball and being active just like his friends.

Marika credits her son for his determination to get better after the fire and his desire for a normal life for how happy he is now.

'It's great to see him as a teenager, not hooked up to a machine, doing what he should be doing. I never thought I would see him playing on the playground again,' she said.

Taking time to thank those people who supported the family in the years following the fire, Marika added: 'It's a horrific thing that happened but it is not the end of the world, there's light at the end of the tunnel if you keep going and there's support and help.

'We have a great community and people in the region have been brilliant to us.'
