As the financial crisis hit in 2008, she spoke for the nation when she asked a group of economists: ‘Why did nobody notice?’

Four years on, the Queen finally got her answer – although it didn’t seem much to her liking.

The monarch was visiting the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street yesterday when she was buttonholed by one of its financial policy experts.

Golden look: Her Majesty examines the stacks of gold bars stored in the Bank's vaults

Royal inspection: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were shown the vaults at the Bank of England where thousands of gold bars are kept

Sujit Kapadia said he wanted to put 
her mind at rest after she famously described the credit crunch as 
‘awful’ during a visit to the London School of Economics in 2008.

At the time, she asked academics how the onset of the crisis could have been missed when it was so enormous.

Yesterday Mr Kadapia told her that it 
was partly because financial crises, like flu pandemics and earthquakes,
 are hard to predict.

People, she was also informed, got complacent because they thought the risk was being managed better than before.

The Queen grimaced at this and said: ‘But people had got a bit...lax, had they?’

Usually, she is notoriously discreet about her views on international events.

But, remarkably, the Queen went on to 
suggest that the Financial Services Authority may not have been 
aggressive enough in its policing. She said: ‘The Financial Services – 
what do they call themselves, the regulators – Authority, which was 
really quite new … it didn’t have any teeth.’

The Duke of Edinburgh didn’t help matters much, asking: ‘There’s not another one coming, is there?

He then fixed Mr Kapadia and his group with a typically gimlet eye and barked: ‘Don’t do it again!’

Afterwards Mr Kapadia was optimistic 
as he assessed the encounter, saying: ‘It was a real pleasure to be able
 to offer some explanation. I think she recognised that these things are
 very difficult and it’s not a straightforward exercise.

‘The strongest thing I got [from the Queen] is what are we trying to do so it doesn’t happen again.’

The FSA, which is being disbanded 
after failing to spot the financial crisis which engulfed Britain, later
 issued a stiff response to the Queen’s remarks.

It said: ‘We’ve widely acknowledged 
that the regulatory approach before the financial crisis in 2008 was 
flawed and has since been completely changed.’

It was the Queen’s ninth visit to the 
Bank. On her first, as the 11-year-old Princess Elizabeth, she signed a 
thousand pound note.

Interesting discussion: The Queen was taken with the discussion on how another downturn could be prevented, while the Duke joked with the Bank's staff

Reason why: The Queen spoke to Sujit Kapadia who explained why the financial crisis wasn't foreseen

During yesterday’s visit, she and 
Prince Philip were each given the honour of each signing a £1million 
banknote, known as a ‘giant’ by staff.

As she scribbled her signature next to the 1937 note, she muttered: ‘It hasn’t improved, really.’

On their tour, the Queen must have 
been a little over-awed by the £27billion worth that glittered in the 
Bank of England’s basement vault.

Visit: A large crowd had gathered outside the Bank as the Royal couple toured inside, which included an inspection of bank notes

It’s one of nine vaults dotted around London, in which the Bank stores around £200billion of gold.

This one contains 63,000 gold bars stacked in eight rows.

Each four-tonne stack is four pallets high, and each pallet carries 80 bars.

While, at 13kg – around 2st – a gold 
bar is a little heavy to steal, the Duke of Edinburgh did seem tempted 
by the £1million banknote he was asked to sign.

He joked ‘is this just lying about?’, adding ‘you won’t miss it, will you?’.

Signature: The Queen and the Duke each signed a £1 million bank note to go into the guest book

Afterwards the Governor of the Bank, 
Sir Mervyn King, thanked the Queen for her visit, describing the Bank’s 
staff as ‘unsung heroes’ who had kept the economy going ‘in the most 
difficult circumstances’.

And he asked the Queen for two early 
Christmas presents. One was her signature on the banknote, and the other
 was the Royal Assent on the Financial Services Bill.

‘When is the Bill due?’ The Queen 
asked. ‘It has gone through Parliament and should be with you before 
Christmas,’ Sir Mervyn replied.
