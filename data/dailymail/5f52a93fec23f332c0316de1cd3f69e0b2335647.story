An Australian photographer has been inspired to bring back to life black and white images found on a Flickr archive, the Costică Acsinte Archive.

The original 5,000 images were taken by a Romanian photographer Costică Acsinte, who died in 1984 and since been digitised by photo enthusiast Cezar Popescu from 2013. 

It was the photographer Jane Long's fascination with the post war images and their subjects, that prompted her to give each character a story through her new series 'The Dancing with Costica'.

Artist, Jane Long admits to having a favourite from the series; Innocence, which took the longest to become a character in the tales of her own invention

'I thought I needed some practice with restoration work so I did a search and that’s where I came across the Costica Acsinte Archive,' Ms Long told Daily Mail Australia.

'They were hauntingly beautiful.'

The Brisbane based conceptual photographer has worked as a graphic designer for 20 years, but over the past two years she has found herself only working in photography.

'I missed the photo-shop element, photography wasn't enough.

'Once I coloured up the original images I felt they looked quite real,' she said. 'I didn't want them to look too real, I didn't want people to think it was shot as a colour image.

Working with historical images and restoring them was a concept completely foreign Ms Long, but the beauty and mystery of the images drew her in, giving the artist freedom to create anything she envisioned.

The image, Fresh, was one of 5,000 images taken by by a Romanian war photographer Costică Acsinte

'I like ambiguity so it made sense for it to look real and then to create a fantasy scene around them.

'What people think is real is not, and what they think is not real actually is.'

Ms Long describes the concept of her series as the complete opposite to the original images.

'I was free to create anything I wanted, making them beautiful and happy. Many of the images are  post war so it was still a dark time for them.'

The artist admits to having a favourite from the series; Innocence, which took the longest to become a character in the tales of her own invention.

'Innocence was the first image that jumped out for me.

'It took me a long time to find a story for her, I kept going back to her asking myself "What would I do?", she said. 'She is close to my heart.'

Jane Long plans on continuing restoration of images and is currently working on a similar shot to Innocence.

Said said, 'restoring and recolouring the images is only part of the process, the rest is the dance.'

The post war images have since been digitised by photo enthusiast Cezar Popescu. Singalong, above, was another favourite of Longs
