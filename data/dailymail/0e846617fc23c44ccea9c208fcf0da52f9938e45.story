Two horses used for carriage rides at Queen Victoria's former summer house have been seized by police over fears they were being mistreated.

The RSPCA is now caring for the horses which were formerly based at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, and which were said to be so thin they nearly had to be put down.

The animals were used to pull carriages around the estate, which was built in the 19th century as a private home for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

Although the house is now under the care of English Heritage, the horses were owned by an independent contractor.

When English Heritage staff noticed the poor health of the horses, they called the RSPCA, and the contractor has now been sacked.

A source told Island Echo that the two horses had no body fat whatsoever, and would probably have been put down if they had not been rescued within days.

A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'We attended along with the police and an independent vet after a call from a concerned member of the public about the condition of two horses there.

'The police seized the horses and placed them in our care.This is now an ongoing investigation so we cannot comment further.'

Hampshire Police said that no one has been arrested over the treatment of the horses. 

The general manager at Osborne House, Rob Flower, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the situation. We were concerned about the treatment of the horses and alerted the RSPCA.

'Our first priority is the welfare of the horses and we are working closely with the RSPCA.'

English Heritage said that the contractor was given free use of the house's stables and paddocks to give carriage rides to guests.

However, Osborne House did not profit from the arrangement.

The home was designed by Prince Albert to look like an Italian palazzo, and was built between 1845 and 1851.

The couple would spend several months a year at the house, and after Albert's death Victoria continued to pay regular visits, dying there in 1901.

Osborne House was used as an officer training college by the Royal Navy after Edward VII gave it to the nation.

The house and grounds are now open to the public, while the estate's cricket pavilion can be rented out by holidaymakers.
