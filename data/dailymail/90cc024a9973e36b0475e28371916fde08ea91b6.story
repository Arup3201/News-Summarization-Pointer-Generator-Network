A 17-year-old boy was lured to a skate park in Baytown, Texas, by a so-called friend and then viciously beaten by the girl and two others.

Dylan Beard was punched and kicked him in the face and ribs and called ‘f*****’ and ‘booty lover’ during the October 12 incident.

Beard bit through his tongue during the attack and suffered chipped teeth, a broken nose, a black eye and lacerations to the knees and elbows.

He says his so-called friend, a 17-year-old girl, started hitting the home-schooled teen. 

‘Then two of her friends who are guys jumped in and they all started hitting me, got on the ground hit me and punched me,’ he told KHOU.

The girl is facing an assault charge, but the victim’s mom Jennifer Beard contacted local community activist and Nation Of Islam activist Quanell X after becoming frustrated at the local police’s lax response.

At a press conference on Thursday, Quanell accused the cops of being negligent by allegedly ignoring witnesses, refusing statements and openly insulting Beard, all because he is gay.

Quanell has filed a hate crime complaint with the FBI.

'We are asking for the department of justice to step in and investigate this assault as a hate crime. It was planned to target him because he's gay,' he said.

Beard's mom said he is currently scared to let her son go outside alone. 

'It was horrendous, I just couldn't even believe what I was seeing... It scares me now that he can be jumped because he's gay.' she told the Houston Chronicle.

Baytown police say they are still investigating the case.

'We are taking steps, reaching out if there is a misunderstanding, with that our doors are opens,' said Lt. Eric Freed.
