David Dimbleby, pictured as an undergraduate at Oxford University where he was editor the student magazine, said he was proud to be elected to the Bullingdon Club

It is the Oxford drinking society with some very important alumni – and a rather poor reputation.

But the Bullingdon Club was once a perfectly gentlemanly outfit, according to broadcaster David Dimbleby.

The Question Time host has revealed his pride at belonging to the controversial group that counts David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson among its former members.

The 74-year-old said: ‘I loved being elected to the Bullingdon Club and I’m very proud of the uniform that I can still get into.

‘We never did these disgusting disgraceful things that Boris did.

‘We
never broke windows or got wildly drunk. It was a completely different 
organisation from what it became when Boris Johnson, David Cameron, and 
George Osborne joined, who seemed to be ashamed of it, pulling their 
photographs and so on.’

This
comment appears to be a reference to attempts by the Bullingdon Club’s 
official photographers, Gillman and Soame, to prevent newspapers from 
publishing the picture featured here.

Bullingdon
stories typically involve drunk, well-off young men in expensive 
clothes smashing up restaurants – only to present the owner with a 
cheque to cover the damage at the end of the night.

Mr Cameron has told friends he is ‘deeply embarrassed’ over his Bullingdon days.

The Prime Minister graduated from Oxford with a first-class degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics in 1988.

Mr Dimbleby left with a third in the same degree more than two decades earlier.

Despite
the BBC star’s claims about better behaviour, critics may point out 
that ‘the Buller’, as its well-heeled members refer to it, was notorious
long before Mr Cameron and his Conservative colleagues became involved. 

Novelist Evelyn Waugh 
wrote of ‘the Bollinger Club’ in Decline and Fall, describing it as 
‘English county families baying for broken glass’.

Mr Dimbleby, speaking to Radio Times,
also criticised the BBC and other broadcasters for ‘demeaning’ older 
women by taking them off-air.

Mr Dimbleby – once labelled a 
‘charming dinosaur’ by former newsreader Anna Ford – said age should not
be a factor for women, claiming they ‘mature elegantly and better than 
men, very often’.

He 
added that executives are told that ‘attractive young women bring in a 
bigger audience than less-attractive older women, to say nothing of 
less-attractive older men’.

He continued: ‘That’s the way the TV industry works. I think it’s wrong. If you look at American TV, it keeps women at work.

‘They
use their experience in that same way that they would use John 
Simpson’s experience or mine. It is demeaning to women and a crazy loss 
of talent.’
