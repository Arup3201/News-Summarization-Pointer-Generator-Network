A small Colorado town concerned over government surveillance practices see an answer in drone hunting licenses.

Deer Trail, Colorado—population 500—is considering a permit that would allow its freedom-minded citizens to shoot down U.S. unmanned aircraft for cash rewards.

The seven-member town board will soon vote on the measure it hopes will be a real money-maker. And though they see the licenses as a fun jab at the federal government, the resident who drafted ordinance isn’t laughing.

Not on my watch: Deer Trail, Colorado (population 500) is mulling the idea of instituting a town-sanctioned drone hunting licenses. Mayor Frank Fields demonstrates what the hunting might look like

‘To [them], it’s a novelty,’ Phillip Steel, the man behind the idea told KHGH. ‘To me, I’m serious.’

Steel fears the country is becoming increasingly controlled by a government bent on controlling its citizens through surveillance and wants Deer Trail to stand out as an exception.

‘We do not want drones in town,’ said Steel. ‘They fly in town, they get shot down.’

Steel calls his ordinance ‘very symbolic,’ but its anything but a vague gesture. It was submitted complete with age restrictions, allowable ammunition types, and prescribed fee and reward amounts.

As per the ordinance:

‘The Town of Deer Trail shall issue a reward of $100 to any shooter who presents a valid hunting license and the following identifiable parts of an unmanned aerial vehicle whose markings and configuration are consistent with those used on any similar craft known to be owned or operated by the United States federal government.’

'I'm gonna shoot it down, ordinance or no': Phillip Steel drafted the ordinance and is serious about drone-hunting licenses even if some town boardspeople aren't quite convinced

Drone's eye view? An aerial shot of how a drone might see the town of 500, though Steel admits he's never seen one flying above Deer Trail

Drone days: The small town has, until now, been mostly known for hosting the 'world's first rodeo' in 1896. Now it may hold the world's first drone hunt

The licenses would cost $25 and shooters must be 21 or over.

‘The applicant,’ reads the ordinance, ‘must be able to read and understand English.’

‘Basically, I do not believe in the idea of a surveillance society and I believe we are headed that way,’ explained Steel.

Steel acknowledged that destroying a U.S. drone would be a federal offense.

Cash reward: Shooting down a drone would constitute a federal offense. Nonetheless, the ordinance even specifies bounty amounts of up to $100

He also admitted he’s never actually seen a drone.

‘I’m gonna shoot it down,’ said the defiant Steel. ‘Ordinance or no.’

But not everyone in the town best known for claiming to have hosted the ‘world’s first rodeo’ in 1869 is taking the drone hunting as literally as Steel.

‘Even if a tiny percentage of people get [a] drone license, that's cool,’ resident and town board member David Boyd told KHGH. ‘That's a lot of money to a small town like us.’

People like Boyd and town clerk Kim Oldfield haven’t given their full support to the idea of legalized drone hunting, but they can see fun and profit in a sort of ‘Drone Days’ celebrations with skeet shooting in lieu of the real thing.

‘I can see it as a benefit, monetarily speaking, because of the novelty of the ordinance,’ said Oldfield.

The town board is scheduled to vote on drone hunting licenses August 6.

'I haven't made my decision yet': Deer Trail mayor Frank Fields says he's undecided on the measure, which is up for a vote August 6
