A photo-holic father has created the ultimate family album - featuring his wife and daughters dressed as superheroes and captured in absurd, photoshopped poses.

Through the wonders of modern re-touching technology, John Wilhelm has turned his daughters into Batman soaring through the sky, a butterfly perched on a leaf and even a beaver chewing through a tree.

The 44-year-old from Winterthur, Switzerland has created hundreds of amazing images because he was bored of taking the same old photos.

It's BatLou! A photoholic father has created the ultimate family album of his wife and daughters dressed as superheroes - such as Batman soaring through the sky - because he was bored of taking the same photos

Alongside his three daughters - Lou, five, Mila, two, and Yuna, six months - the 44-year-old's favourite model is his wife, Judith.

John said: 'Judith and the kids absolutely love the pictures.

'They do think I'm a bit obsessed with my little hobby though.

'I wanted to try something new as our older photos were just standard and boring.'

Family album: John Wilhelm has photoshopped his daughters into scenes from Little Red Riding Hood

Bizarre: This one, named Mila Button and Lou-ke the Engine Drivers, was created - along with hundreds of other amazing images - because he was bored of taking the same normal photos

Skills! The Ropedancer shows his 6-month-old daughter seemingly tight rope walking amidst a mountainous scene

It's Lou-igi! The 44-year-old from Winterthur, 
Switzerland has three daughters - Lou, five (pictured here as a Super Mario brother), Mila, two, and Yuna, six months

How does he do it? He starts with a base image before layering them up with 3D objects ranging from mouse traps disguised with sweets and giant bisons

Plie! This snap, entitled Bolshoi Ballet  junior class warm up, is inspired by the Bolshoi Ballet

Snake charmer: This one, named 'Just an Italian snake charmer' forms part of the quirky range of snaps taken by a Swiss father

Practice makes perfect: The Swiss father of three has hundreds of hours of retouching

Just a special effect! He superimposes animals into a lot of his images alongside his children and they look scarily authentic 

Best model: The 44-year-old's favourite model is his wife, Judith. John said: 'Judith and the kids absolutely love the pictures'

Each image takes John more than five hours to finish, starting from the moment he takes the base image.

Then he layers them up with 3D objects, ranging from mouse traps disguised with sweets to giant bisons.

John said: 'My favourite picture is the one of Lou running through poppy fields.

'It was the first composite image and it's absolutely beautiful.

'Now after hundreds of hours of retouching I hope my work has become much better.'

Oops, mum I don't know where my little sister is! His children love to act out and help him create the snaps 

Helping hand: One of the pictures shows his children seemingly pump up Judith's pregnancy belly with air

Trick of the eye: He spends hours editing his photos and the results are quite extraordinary 

Ew! This one, named 'Journey to the center of the nappy' is a hilarious take on changing a baby's smelly diaper

Ouch! John has superimposed his eldest daughter into a mouse trap filled with her favourite sweets 

Animal behaviour: This snap is named 'just a little beaver' and shows his daughter as a burrowing woodland creature

Mini-me: This snap was created to depict his children in springtime

Gooooaaaal! His children have dressed up in their favourite football kits and been superimposed onto a pitch

When they're not dressed up: Alongside his three daughters - Lou, five, Mila, two, and Yuna, six months - the 44-year-old's favourite model is his wife, Judith

The man behind the lens: John Wilhelm is a photo-holic father who created the ultimate family album of his wife and daughters dressed as superheroes and in hilarious poses
