A wave of weddings among pensioners is driving a rise in the popularity of marriage, according to the latest official figures yesterday.

The number of those aged between 65 and 70 who were married in 2012 went up by a quarter among men and more than a fifth among women.

The growing trend to marriage in retirement points to a generation of pensioners who no longer believe their lives are settled when they collect their bus pass. It follows evidence of increasing levels of marriage breakdown among the newly-retired.

There was an annual rise of five per 
cent in the overall number of weddings in England and Wales to 262,240 –
 the highest total in any year since 2004.

Although the fast-rising population is partly the cause, marriage rates are also at their highest since the mid-2000s.

There
 were more brides and grooms in every age group, but the figures from 
the Office for National Statistics show that people are choosing to 
marry later in life. The average age of a bride is now 34, compared to 
under 29 in the 1970s.

The
 biggest leap in marriages was among those aged between 65 and 70. 
Grooms in their late 60s increased by 25 per cent between 2011 and 2012,
 to 3,520, and brides of the same age went up by 21 per cent, to 1,990.

Around one in 10 were single before tying the knot, two thirds were divorced and the rest widowed.

The overall rise in marriages was accompanied by an increase in couples choosing church weddings –
 up by 4.6 per cent in a year to 77,910 after years of decline. However 
seven out of 10 weddings are now civil ceremonies, most of them 
conducted in ‘approved premises’.

Harry
 Benson, of the Marriage Foundation think-tank, said the figures were 
‘excellent’ news but added: ‘Many more years of similar rises are needed
 to reverse the catastrophic long-term trend away from marriage.

‘The
 awful reality is that only one in six parents who don’t get married 
stay together compared to four in six parents who do get married. Less 
marriage means more family breakdown.’

The trend 
means the average age of marriage for men and women was 36 and 34 
respectively, a figure which has been rising steadily after a slight 
fall in 2007 and 2008. 

Andrew
 Newbury, head of family law at Slater & Gordon solicitors, said: 
'In the past, people might have considered that they might be too old to
 remarry once they'd reached pension age.'

'However,
 that baby boomer generation with longer life expectancy, improved 
health and financial security can see that it's not necessarily too late
 to start a new life.

'Going by current examples, it's still possible to have a long and happy marriage after the age of 65.' 

However, the ONS also found that a third of marriages will end in divorce by the 20th wedding anniversary.

Commenting
 on the rise in pensioner weddings, Andrew Newbury, of law firm Slater 
and Gordon, said: ‘The baby boomer generation with longer life 
expectancy, and improved health and financial security can see that it’s
 not necessarily too late to start a new life. It’s still possible to 
have a long and happy marriage after the age of 65.’
