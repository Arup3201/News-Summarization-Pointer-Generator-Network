Dr. Martin Salia, who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone, is in extremely critical condition on Sunday at a Nebraska hospital

A surgeon who contracted Ebola while working in Sierra Leone is in extremely critical condition on Sunday at a Nebraska hospital, his doctors said.

Dr. Martin Salia, who was diagnosed with Ebola on Monday, arrived in Omaha on Saturday to be treated at the Nebraska Medical Center's biocontainment unit that has successfully treated two other Ebola patients this fall.

Salia is 'extremely ill,' said Dr. Phil Smith, who is helping oversee Salia's treatment. The 44-year-old Salia might be more ill than the first Ebola patients successfully treated in the United States, according to the hospital.

'This is an hour-by-hour situation,' Smith said on Sunday, adding that a team of specialists is treating Salia's most serious issues. 'We will do everything humanly possible to help him fight this disease.'

Ebola has killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa, mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leona. Of the 10 people treated for the virus in the U.S., all but one has recovered.

After Salia arrived in Omaha, his ambulance to the hospital was accompanied by a single Nebraska State Patrol cruiser and a fire department vehicle - a subdued arrival in contrast to the August delivery of Dr. Rick Sacra, whose ambulance was flanked by numerous police cars, motorcycles and fire vehicles.

Salia has been working as a general surgeon at Kissy United Methodist Hospital in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown. It's not clear whether he was involved in the care of Ebola patients. 

Kissy is not an Ebola treatment unit, but Salia worked in at least three other facilities, United Methodist News said, citing health ministry sources.

Touch down: Health workers in protective suits transport Dr. Martin Salia, a surgeon working in West Africa who had been diagnosed with Ebola, from a jet that brought him from Sierra Leone to a waiting ambulance that will take him to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday

Salia, a Sierra Leone citizen who lives in Maryland, first showed Ebola symptoms on November 6 but tested negative for the virus. He eventually tested positive on Monday.

The U.S. State Department said it helped facilitate the transfer of Salia; the U.S. Embassy in Freetown said he paid for the expensive evacuation. The travel costs and care of other Ebola patients flown to the U.S. have been covered by the groups they worked for in West Africa.

Salia's wife, Isatu Salia, said in a telephone interview that when she spoke to her husband early Friday his voice sounded weak and shaky. But he told her 'I love you' in a steady voice, she said.

The two prayed together, and their children, ages 12 and 20, are coping, Isatu Salia said, calling her husband 'my everything.'

Nebraska Medical Center spokesman Taylor Wilson said members of Salia's family were not at the hospital on Saturday, but were expected to arrive 'in the near future.'

Sierra Leone is one of the three West Africa nations hit hard by an Ebola epidemic this year. Five other doctors in Sierra Leone have contracted Ebola, and all have died. 

Dr. Salia is the third Ebola patient to be treated by the UNMC, one of a handful of medical facilities in the United States specially designated to treat Ebola patients. 

Both of the previous patients survived. 

'Just as we have done in previous cases, every precaution is being taken to ensure the evacuation is completed safely and securely, that critical care is provided en route, and that strict isolation is maintained,' said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

'We immediately started preparing the unit and notifying staff members of this possibility,' biocontainment unit medical director Phil Smith said in a statement.

Wife: Isatu Salia, seen here with her husband, described him as 'caring' and 'hardworking'. She will now travel to Nebraska to be with him

'We've obviously been through this a couple of times before so we know what to expect.' 

There are currently no cases of Ebola in the United States, where nine people have been treated for the killer virus. 

Dr. Salia is the tenth. Only one - Liberian-born Thomas Eric Duncan - has died from the disease on U.S. soil.

The cases are part of the deadliest Ebola outbreak ever, which has killed more than 5,100 people in West Africa and infected nearly 15,000 in total, mostly in hardest hit Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Despite some hopeful signs - Liberia has lifted its state of emergency and the DR Congo announced the end of its own, unrelated, outbreak of Ebola - the recent deaths of three people in Mali have fueled fears of a new African hotspot.

There is no known cure for Ebola, one of the deadliest known pathogens, but trials for several possible treatments were announced this week in West Africa and Canada. 

The disease is spread through contact with bodily fluids.

Salia received his surgical training from a group called the Pan African Academy of Christian Surgeons, which seeks to train African doctors on a level comparable to training they would receive in the U.S., said Richard Toupin, of Auburn, Indiana, a fellow medical missionary.

'He is one of the best-trained surgeons in his country,' Toupin said. 'He is a very competent surgeon.'

Bruce Steffes, executive director of PAACS, said Salia graduated from the surgical training program in 2008. The training includes a requirement to practice in Africa for four years after completion. 

As a result, Steffes said, Salia was free to practice anywhere he wanted, but elected to stay in Sierra Leone, where the need for surgeons is immense.

Sons: The medic, who has at least two sons, including Hinwaii (left) and Maada (right), came down with symptoms of Ebola on November 6. Tests results on Monday were positive, according to the official

'People like Martin are just absolutely dedicated, highly trained... and doing their best in absolutely horrifying conditions,' Steffes said.

Jeff Bleijerveld, director of global ministries for the United Brethren in Christ church, said he last talked to Salia in February 2013, when they met to discuss planning for a hospital in the southern part of Sierra Leone. 

He recalled watching Salia perform a hernia surgery on a young boy, assisted by a handyman who was not actually a doctor. He recalled Salia leading the surgical team in prayer before the operation.

The United Brethren played an early role in Salia's medical training.

'He's a quiet leader,' Bleijerveld said. 

'Our people still have a real affection for him.'
