A four-man demolition crew on Tuesday started tearing down the squalid Massachusetts house in which the skeletal remains of three dead infants were found.

The home's owner had until 9am on Tuesday to contact the town or seek a court order to halt the demolition, but failed to do so, Blackstone Town Administrator Daniel Keyes said.

'We have a professional demolition team in there right now,' he said, as a backhoe clawed at the outer walls.

Erika Murray's home is guarded by a Blackstone police officer last month after a three-year-old girl and a five-month-old girl were found in the home along with three dead infants

All utilities had been shut off and someone went through the building to make sure no one was inside before work began, he said.

The town's fire department was hosing down the debris and dust to contain the offensive odors still emanating from the home which had been filled with dirty diapers, animal carcasses and infested with insects and rodents.

Blackstone's Board of Health ordered the demolition, which is expected to take two days.

Erika Murray, the woman who lived in the house with four children and her longtime boyfriend, is being held on $1 million bail on charges including fetal death concealment. She has pleaded not guilty.

Murray's lawyer Keith Halpern said last week that she appears to have mental health issues. 

He said Murray told him the dead infants were born starting about eight years ago and at least one was born alive and lived a few days before she found the child dead in a bassinet.

Accused: Erika Murray, pictured in court last week, told cops that one of the children found dead in her home had lived for several days before she found it dead. The remains of two other babies were also found

The state medical examiner has not determined how old the babies were or how they died.

Murray's other four children, ranging in age from six months to 13 years, were removed from the house in August. 

Authorities found the infants' remains in a more thorough search a few weeks later.

The remains of the three infants were found in Murray's older children's bedroom closets when authorities executed search warrants after neighbors raised the alarm. 

Her four children, ranging in age from five months to 13 years, were rescued from her filthy home on August 28 after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's home asking for help to quieten the crying five-month-old baby. The neighbor found the youngest child covered in feces.

Neither the baby nor Murray's three-year-old child have birth records and both are severely malnourished. authorities said. The infant is extremely sensitive to sunlight and the three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds.

In court last week, prosecutors said the three-year-old's muscle tone suggested that she had spent most of her young life on her back. 

Workers in hazmat suits spent days cleaning out the house. The town spent $20,000 on the cleanup and about $8,500 to take it down.

The house is owned by Kristina Rivera of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the sister of Murray's boyfriend, Raymond Rivera. 

She had no comment and city officials said she has not responded to them.

Raymond Rivera, who lived in the basement, has pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he grew marijuana in the home.
