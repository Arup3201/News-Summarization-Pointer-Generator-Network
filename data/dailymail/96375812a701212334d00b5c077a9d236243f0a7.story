Andy Murray heads into the US Open next week unperturbed by the fact that he has yet to win a title of any sort since Wimbledon last year.

The 27 year-old Scot, who has not made a final since returning from back surgery, remains among the favourites to replicate his Flushing Meadows triumph of two years ago despite the recent lack of silverware.

'I’m not concerned,' he said on Friday. 'It’s always tough when you come back from an injury and it always takes time to get the consistency. It maybe took me a bit longer than expected to get back to being able to train 100 per cent.

Gearing up: Andy Murray trains for the US Open, which begins on Monday and sees him take on Robin Haase

Back then: The Scot won the US Open in 2012 - the first Grand Slam of his career

Out of form: Murray has struggled this year and has not win a title since Wimbledon 2013

'The standard on the tour is very high, there are no easy matches and it is difficult to reach the semi-final or final of a tournament let alone win a title. I think its a very open tour right now.

'I’ve struggled a little bit in the later stages of the tournaments this year but I think I have also put in some very good performances and I’m confident that I’m back to where I want to be, so it’s just a case of being patient and believing in myself.

'Things with Amelie (Mauresmo) have been going well here this year on the practice court, and we had a really good training block in Miami as well. I trained harder and smarter there than I had been able to for a long while, so that’s important, both mentally and physically.' 

Turnaround: New coach Amelie Mauresmo has been tasked with getting Murray's career back on track 

Fully fit: Murray says he is over the back problems that have plagued him over the past year 

Murray has been handed a tough draw, beginning with Robin Haase, the Dutchman who nearly upset him over five sets in New York three years ago.

'Robin and I have had some great matches over the last few years, obviously the last time we met at the US Open in 2011 it was a tough match. Hopefully this year I will be able to get out of the blocks a little quicker, but he can be a tough player, so I won’t be underestimating him.'
