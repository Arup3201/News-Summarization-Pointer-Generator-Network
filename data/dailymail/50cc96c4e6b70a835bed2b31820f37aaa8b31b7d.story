Anger: Sandra Lee marched out of Bergdorf Goodman after thinking she had heard offensive comments about her 'semi-homemade' empire

Television cook and author Sandra Lee  marched out of Bergdorf Goodman restaurant  thinking she had overheard offensive comments about her 'semi-homemade' empire, according to a diner.

The 46-year-old was at BG restaurant when she reportedly picked up on remarks made by the new boyfriend of Calvin Klein’s ex Nick Gruber.

Gruber who was dining with new partner John Luciano on Tuesday evening, did not recognise the celebrity chef when she waked into the restaurant.

Ms Lee's vast Semi-Homemade empire is all based around her concept of culinary shortcuts - a typical recipe uses 70 per cent store-bought food and 30 per cent fresh produce.

Luciano told the New York Post that he proceeded to explain to Gruber what Ms Lee was famous for:  'She takes an angel food cake, slices it in half, opens a can of 
frosting, frosts the cake, calls it semi-homemade, and makes a lot of 
money.'

But he said his comments were overheard by Ms Lee who took immediate offence and complained to the manager of the New York restaurant.

'She said she was going to walk around the restaurant to find out who 
it was,' Luciano told the paper.

Luciano said that Ms Lee, whose boyfriend is New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, mistakenly confronted a group of confused Italian tourists, saying, 'I’m Sandra Lee, I have feelings, too.'

She then left the restaurant with her friend, while Luciano said a member of their group went after the mother-of-two to explain his comments were not malicious.

A spokesman for Ms Lee told the New York Post: 'It’s sad that people make up stories to see their name in the press.'

After 20 cookbooks, two cooking shows, a magazine and a memoir, Ms Lee's Semi-Homemade brand was built upon the concept that anyone can feed their family using pre-packaged goods with a little bit of imagination.

Raised by an abusive, drug-addicted mother, by the age of 12, Ms Lee was responsible for raising her four siblings on welfare and food stamps.

When asked by The New York Times earlier this year what she thought of the people who criticise her for using processed food in her recipes, Ms Lee responded: 'I think they’re snobs. I’m not sure that some of the food purists are in touch with what really goes on in American households.'

She continued: 'It’s shtick. That’s how some people get their press. There are 17 million children in this country going hungry every day, and we’re worried about my Kwanzaa cake from 10 years ago? That’s what I think is ridiculous.'
