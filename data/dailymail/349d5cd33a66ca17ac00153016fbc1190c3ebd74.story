Life has changed for Moeen Ali this summer but he has risen spectacularly to every challenge thrown at him, from proving his worth as Graeme Swann’s spinning successor to dealing with the fallout from expressing an opinion on Gaza.

Not many England players have made quite such an impact, on and off the field, in their first year of Test cricket, but then not many have the same potential to be both a key player and a positive role model for modern Britain.

Moeen talked with a rare maturity at The Kia Oval on Wednesday, if slightly more warily than before his beliefs became a national issue, as he contemplated his extraordinary introduction to both Test cricket and the public consciousness.

Controversy: Moeen Ali admits he did not realise how much would be made of his wristbands

The impression that English cricket has a gem in its midst, formed when meeting him for the first time in a Birmingham school in May, was certainly reinforced as Moeen tackled his unexpected off- spinning success, his problems against the short ball, his faith and those pro-Palestinian wristbands.

First Gaza and proof that Moeen is different from sportsmen all too often accused of lacking a hinterland. ‘I have a lot of opinions on a lot of stuff,’ said Moeen.

‘I wasn’t trying to be political. It was a humanitarian thing. I will speak about it at some point but I don’t think it’s the right time, before a Test.

Role model: The part-time spinner is a role model within the English side, particularly for British Asians

‘I didn’t think the wristbands would be such a big deal. I just totally forgot I had them on when I went into bat. I have to be a lot more careful. ICC didn’t allow me to wear them and I accepted that. I’ve had a lot of positive reaction and I’d like to thank the ECB for supporting me on it.’

A picture emerged after that third Test incident of Moeen seemingly at a political rally in his home city. The reality was a bit more prosaic. ‘I was actually on my way to ASDA with my family,’ he insisted while wearing Waitrose on his shirt. 

‘A guy recognised me and asked me to pose for a picture. I do like to do charity work but on that day all I was doing was going shopping.’

It was his six second-innings wickets in Southampton followed by four more in the second innings at Old Trafford that mark out Moeen as much more than the part-time spinner that Alastair Cook and Peter Moores thought.

Change up: The spinner has had to speed up his action to make an impact with the ball in test cricket

Stuart Broad was a notable absentee on Tuesday as England began preparing ahead of the final Test but he is still expected to take his place at The Kia Oval.

Broad’s nose was broken in two places when he was struck by a 88mph delivery from Varun Aaron while batting at Old Trafford last week but England’s medical staff have given him the all-clear.

He sat out Tuesday's net practice but England insist this was part of the plan and that he will be fit to take his place on Wednesday when Ben Stokes and Steven Finn get a final chance to force their way into the side.

Broad was considering wearing a mask here to protect his face but it now seems he will wear a protective nose splint instead.

‘It’s not very pretty,’ Joe Root said. ‘He’s not got the boy-band looks you’d normally associate with Stuart. He’s milking it, as you’ve probably seen on all the social media, but I’m sure he’s desperate to play.’

Another absentee at the Oval was India captain MS Dhoni who, instead of practising, decided to indulge his hobby of shooting at a London range. Dhoni, it seems, is very much a law unto himself.

Ahead of tomorrow’s final Investec Test he is on 19 wickets from four matches, just one short of the England record in a home series against India, held since 1967 by Ray Illingworth.

‘After the first Test, where I went for quite a few, I felt the need for change,’ said Moeen.

‘Ian Bell took me to one side and said, “Look, this is what you’ve got to do to be consistent in the Test side: bowl quicker and straighter, especially on a first-day pitch”.

‘Then I went into the nets and the umpire Kumar Dharmasena was there and I asked him, as a former off-spinner, how I could bowl quicker without it being flat.

‘And he said, “Just grab your pocket as quickly as you can with your non-bowling arm when you bowl”. As soon as I bowled one ball I knew it would work.

Delight: After a tough Test at Trent Bridge, Ali has improved markedly, after taking advice from Ian Bell

‘I’ve always felt I could take wickets, even at Trent Bridge where I didn’t bowl well, but it was about being consistent and getting the captain to keep me on for longer periods. My mentality changed after that first Test.

‘I don’t feel I’m there yet. But I do believe I’ve taken a big step towards being a decent Test spinner. I feel like I have more control, and that my captain and team-mates can trust me.’

Moeen, of course, is a batsman first as he demonstrated with a century against Sri Lanka at Headingley. But he has run into problems against the short ball against India. 

‘When you get out a couple of times the same way you think about it,’ he said. ‘I’ve probably been thinking about it too much, whether to take it on or not.

Running through: Ali has taken 10 fourth-innings wickets in the last two Tests to knock over the Indian line-up

‘I’m just going to go back to basics and my own game now.’ When we spoke in May, Moeen talked passionately about the good he could do to improve the image of Islam in this country and to encourage British Asian youngsters to be more inclusive and embrace the English system. 

His views have not changed even if, sadly, he has been advised to be careful when talking about religion because, as was the case in one report, it can be misconstrued.

‘I’ve always supported England 100 per cent,’ he said. ‘I was born and raised in England and am more English than people seem to think. 

'If a British Asian supports Pakistan or India I have always questioned it, but I think things are changing.

Centre of attention: The off-spinning batsman has already become a key character in a young team

‘I have never encountered prejudice and that’s what I want British Asian kids to know. That if you work hard, you can achieve anything.

‘That’s the kind of barrier I want to break down. That people think it’s tough or will treat you badly if you’re a practising Muslim or whatever.

‘That is the reason I like to play cricket for England — because I can break down barriers and inspire kids, not just Asian ones, to play.’

It is an attitude that has created a very impressive, modern young Englishman.
