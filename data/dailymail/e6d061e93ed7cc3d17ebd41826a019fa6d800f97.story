A Jet2 flight from Newcastle to Prague was forced into an emergency landing at Leeds Bradford International Airport earlier this morning.

Thirteen fire engines were scrambled to the West Yorkshire airport as the plane carrying 141 passengers was forced to abandon its journey due to what Jet2 have called an 'operational issue.'

The airline added that the incident is now being investigated now that all the passengers have disembarked.

A spokesperson for West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service told the Yorkshire Post that they had received reports of 'smoke in the cabin' caused by 'overheating brakes'.

The emergency services were made aware aware of the plane 'circling' the airport and that there may have been 'engine problems.' 

Thirteen fire engines met the aircraft upon landing at the airport. 

However the investigations are continuing after the plane landed safely at 11.25am, and there was no fire found to be on board. The problems were first discovered as the aircraft flew over the North Sea.

A spokesperson said for Jet2 told MailOnline Travel: 'Today's flight LS509 from Newcastle to Prague diverted to Leeds Bradford Airport this morning as a precautionary measure due to an operational issue. 

The 141 passengers were safely taken off the flight and put on another to continue their journey to Prague

'The aircraft has landed safely and customers will be transferred to an alternative aircraft so they can continue their journey to Prague as soon as possible. 

'We apologise to our customers for the delay to the start of their holiday but their safety is of paramount importance to us.'

A spokesperson for Leeds Bradford Internation Airport added: 'We can confirm the plane landed safely, and all passengers have now been moved onto different flights to continue their journey on to Prague.'
