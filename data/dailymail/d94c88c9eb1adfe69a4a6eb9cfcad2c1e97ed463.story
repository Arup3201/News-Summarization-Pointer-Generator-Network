A Reddit theory that Homer has been in a coma for past 20 years has been shot down by The Simpsons' executive producer.  

Al Jean said that the notion that Homer has been stuck in a coma since the '90s and all the episodes since have been figments of his imagination can be stashed in the 'intriguing but false file'.

A Reddit user proposed the theory based on a 1992 episode called Homer the Heretic.

Homer ended up in the hospital in an 1993 episode after a prank by Bart on April Fool's Day went wrong

Simpsons executive producer Al Jean told TMZ the coma theory belongs in the 'intriguing but false file'

Jean said the theory, and a similar one that claims Bart was killed in an episode that never aired, is false, according to TMZ. 

He said: 'It would mean back in 1993 we would presume the show was going on for years and years more and right before we left, threw this hidden monkey wrench in for all our successors.

'I'm afraid it goes with the 'Dead Bart' episode in the intriguing but false file.'

The Reddit user behind the theory, who posted it nine days ago, offered a response.

The theory also explains why celebrities like Sir Richard Branson (above) are always on the show  

The Simpsons (Bart, Marge, Lisa, Homer and Maggie, left to right) have been on TV for more than 25 years 

In the episode that prompted the coma theory, Homer ponders the meaning of life during a conversation with God.

He insists he can't wait until he's dead to find out, to which God says: 'You can't wait six months?'

Six months later, in an April 1993 episode title 'So It's Come To This: A Simpsons Clip Show', Homer is crushed by a vending machine after an April Fool's prank by Bart and ends up in a coma. 

At the end of the episode, Homer abruptly awakens from the coma to strangle Bart. 

Hardtopickaname wrote: 'I propose that Homer didn't actually wake up from his coma. He is still in a vegetative state and every single Simpsons episode afterwards is in Homer's imagination.

'Homer remembers Bart, Lisa, and Maggie as 10, 8, and 1 year old, so they will always appear that way in his dreams.'

Reddit user Hardtopickaname''s theory got some traction but was eventually shot down by producer Jean 

The theory about Homer being in a coma since 1993 was first posed on Reddit nine days ago 

The theory claims the celebrities who routinely appear on the show are simply examples of Homer's imagination running wild.

'The massive amounts of celebrity appearances are easily explained as well. 

People in comas can sometime hear what people in the same room are saying. 

While Homer wouldn't physically react, his mind processes that information and includes it in his dreams,' 

Simpsons creator Matt Groening has yet to comment on the theory,The Huffington Post reported.

The Simpsons has broadcast more than 500 episodes since its debut in 1989. 

It is America's longest-running sitcom and animated show.
