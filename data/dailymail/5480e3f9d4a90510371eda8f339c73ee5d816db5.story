Steve Bruce has challenged his players to write their names in Hull City folklore and make it a decade of pain for Arsenal at Wembley today.

Ahead of the club’s first-ever FA Cup final, Bruce told his underdogs they will be ‘remembered forever’ if they can upset the odds and make it 10 years without a trophy for Arsene Wenger’s side.

‘I know from experience, the Cup final is like a blur, so my message to the players will be to make sure they savour it and remember it,’ said the Hull manager.

‘Make sure you play a full part, because it’s not a nice memory if you don’t. Can you make a name for yourself? Can you be a hero? Can you go down in this club’s history as the team that beat Arsenal in the Cup final?

‘That’s what I’ll be challenging them to do, and we will have a plan of action to try and beat Arsenal. Just look at last season. Wigan’s players will be remembered forever as Cup winners, and that has to be the spur for us.’

Bruce will continue talks over a new contract after the final and also plans negotiations with Tottenham over a possible £7million move for on-loan midfielder Jake Livermore.

Former Tottenham midfielder Tom Huddlestone insisted Hull were ready to respond to Bruce’s promptings and leave Arsenal stunned.

‘If we were to win a trophy, it would live on for decades to come,’ he said. ‘When you’ve got someone like our manager, who’s won what he’s won, telling you to grasp the chance and have no regrets, you take it on board.

‘The message was, the day has gone before you know it, unless you take your chances, so we intend making the most of it. Occasions like this don’t come around often, so grab it with both hands. It would genuinely be a dream come true for us all.

‘Some unbelievable players over the years have never been to an FA Cup final, so I count myself lucky to be in this position. There’s no point getting there, though, if you’re happy to take a runners-up medal.

‘This is a massive week in our careers and the history of this club. There’s a lot of excitement but equally we know we’ve got a job to do. There was a bit of stage fright when we were there last time, for the semi-final, but we’ll be better for that experience. You only have to see how the players relished it in the second half to realise that.’
