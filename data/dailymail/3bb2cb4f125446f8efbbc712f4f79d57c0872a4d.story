An African-American mother has launched a petition urging Mattel to produce party supplies featuring a black Barbie after failing to find products themed around her daughter's favorite doll.

Karen Braithwaite was organizing daughter Georgia's Barbie-themed fifth birthday party when she discovered the only products available featured the blonde, blue-eyed version of the doll.

Surprised by the lack of black Barbies represented in the products, the mother, from Harlem, New York, launched a Change.org petition urging Mattel to offer a more diverse selection of party supplies.

Taking a stand: Karen Braithwaite (pictured with her daughter Georgia) has launched a petition for Mattel to offer more black Barbie party supplies

The petition has now amassed over 3,000 signatures.

Georgia - whose fifth birthday is this week - told DNAinfo that she wanted a black
Barbie-themed party because the dolls 'look like princesses and fairies,' she explained. 'They look like me.'

But when her mother set out to find party supplies, she found that the only line offered by Mattel included more than 35 products featuring images of the white doll.

Meanwhile, the sole indication of diversity was a 
brown-skinned Barbie and a brunette - 'possibly meant to be a HIspanic,' noted the mother - featured on a tablecloth 
and a handful of hanging decorations.

So Mrs Braithwaite launched the petition, along with an accompanying video and letter explaining her situation and requesting the signatures of others.

She explains in the video: 'This is about more than just my daughter's 
birthday party - it's about promoting diversity, inclusion and respect.'

'This is about more than my daughter's 
birthday party - it's about promoting diversity, inclusion and respect'

Mrs Braithwaite points out that 
Mattel is far from racist; in fact, the toy company sells black, 
Hispanic and Asian barbies and markets many of its products
to young girls of color.

But
she notes that if a black girl wants to have a Barbie-themed birthday party, she has no choice but to use products adorned with the white doll.

She asks in the clip: 'Is that really the message Mattel wants to send in 
2013?'

Mrs Braithwaite explains that the lack of diversity is not only disturbing in the modern world, but it can also negatively affect the image black girls have of themselves.

The petition website reads: 'Featuring the white Barbie so prominently on the party favors while relegating the "ethnic" Barbies to near-invisible cameos sends a clear - and troubling - message to young girls'

On the website for her 
petition she writes : 'Featuring the white Barbie so prominently on the banners, 
cups, napkins, plates, party favors, and invitations, while relegating 
the "ethnic" Barbies to near-invisible cameos sends a clear - and 
troubling - message to young girls.'

The accompanying video illustrates the diversity of Barbie fans.

It shows a sequence of young 
girls from various ethnicities playing with the dolls and saying to the 
camera: 'I am a Barbie girl.'

At the end of the clip, a banner appears that reads: 'Beauty comes in all colors.'

And it seems Mrs Braithwaite isn't the only parent who has experienced difficulty with the lack of diversity in Mattel's Barbie birthday party supplies.

Some of the supporters of the petition have listed their reasons for signing it on the website.

One such woman wrote: 'Every little girl should see herself and be proud.'

Like any other girl: Georgia Braithwaite - whose fifth birthday is this week - says she wants a black Barbie-themed party because the dolls 'look like princesses and fairies,' she explained. 'They look like me'

Another supporter said: 'As a parent of a child of color, it has always been important to our family to have toys that represent our child's image.'

When she contacted Mattel, they apparently told her that it was up to product licensees to produce black Barbie party supplies.

Still, she Mrs Braithwaite says she thinks that the company should play a more active role in ensuring there is a diverse selection of party supplies on offer for consumers.

Says the petition: 'Young girls of 
color have birthdays, and young girls of color love Barbie. So why only 
offer party supplies very prominently featuring one, white Barbie?'
