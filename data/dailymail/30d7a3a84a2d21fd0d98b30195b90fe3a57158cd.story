She certainly shares her older sister’s striking looks.

But despite being just 16 years old, it appears that Lottie Moss has also inherited her famous sibling’s penchant for rebellious behaviour and wayward stars.

The teenager, who was recently signed up to the Storm modelling agency which represents her half-sister Kate, has admitted having her tongue pierced and swooning over bad boys such as Justin Bieber.

The public school girl has quietly delighted in breaking the rules of her Home Counties school by wearing a stud in her tongue after getting it pierced last summer.

In her first interview Lottie discussed her home life with Miss Vogue magazine - a spin-off of the fashion bible aimed at teenage girls.

She said: ‘Sticking my tongue out at school is not wise. They’re quite strict about uniform.’

The model, who lives in Surrey with her parents, talked about a collage of photographs on her bedroom wall explaining: ‘It began with quotes then I started sticking up photo shoots from magazines.

‘On the door of my wardrobe it’s just Justin Bieber though. Then there’s a whole zone dedicated to Leonardo DiCaprio - in his Romeo & Juliet phase obviously. And Zac Efron has his own wall.’

Lottie’s father is Peter Moss, who divorced Kate’s mother Linda in 1987, before marrying Lottie’s mother Inga.

As a supermodel Kate Moss has built a 26 year career and £50million fortune since she was discovered by a talent scout at the age of 15 while on holiday with her father and brother in 1988.

Lottie came to the attention of the Storm modelling agency as a 13-year-old at Kate Moss’ wedding to musician Jamie Hince in 2011.

The supermodel’s rather dubious lovers have included hell-raising Hollywood actor Johnny Depp and drug addicted rock singer Pete Doherty.

Since then Kate has gone on to have a daughter, Lila Grace, 11, with magazine publisher Jefferson Hack and is now married to Hince, lead singer with rock group The Kills, with whom she lives in north London.

Taking over the mantle: The teenager describes her personal style as being as varied as her older sister's

Lottie has vowed to concentrate on her education rather than pursue a full-time modelling career, and is currently studying for her GCSEs this summer. However, she celebrated her 16th birthday by posting her first set of modelling pictures on Twitter in January.

Last month she was photographed in the front row of the Topshop Unique fashion show at London Fashion Week alongside 40-year-old Kate, American Vogue editor Anna Wintour and Topshop owner Sir Philip Green.

She went on to do her bit for the family business, giving her backing to the high street brand which Kate has designed a new collection for this spring.

In the interview Lottie talks of shopping ‘raids’ with her friends in Topshop adding ‘We would ransack it if we could’.

The teenager, whose long blonde hair and willowy frame are eerily reminiscent of Kate at the same age, goes on to describe her personal style as being as varied as her older sister - whose eclectic taste has helped build her into a global style icon.

‘Our styles merge together,’ she said. ‘One days it’s grungy jumpers, the next it’s preppy netball skirts.’

And despite her vow to put her educate first, it seems the lure of the catwalk isn’t too far away with Lottie going on to talk about her dreams of matching her older sister’s career success and hopes of modelling alongside supermodel Cara Delevingne - the 21-year-old society model and grand-daughter of former English Heritage chairman Sir Jocelyn Stevens, often referred to as the new Kate Moss.

‘I’d love to walk in the Chanel show.’ she added. ‘That would be amazing. Wouldn’t it be fun to be backstage with Cara? She’s so funky.’
