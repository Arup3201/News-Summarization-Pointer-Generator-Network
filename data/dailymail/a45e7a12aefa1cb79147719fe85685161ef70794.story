The stars of The Only Way Is Essex are slathering on the fake tan and packing their Louboutins ahead of their annual trip to Marbella.

And it seems that one cast member is pulling out all the stops to ensure she looks at her best poolside at the Ocean Club.

Gemma Collins, who has publicly battled with her weight, has been making every effort to shift the pounds ahead of the summer showdown in Spain - and her hard work has paid off.

Showing off the hard work: TOWIE's Gemma Collins is pictured leaving the ITV studios following a guest appearance on Good Morning Britain - where she revealed her 1st 8lb weightloss

The 32-year-old fashion designer today revealed that she's lost 1st 8lb in six days by cutting out processed foods.

Speaking to Susanna Reid on Good Morning Britain, Gemma said: 'All my life I've done every diet from 
the maple syrup diet, dieting pills, shake diets, the cabbage soup diet,
 the egg diet, the grapefruit diet. There's no diet I haven't done. 
Nothing has worked for me.'

Gemma went on to explain that she wanted to make the most of her time off filming the ITV2 reality TV show. 'I basically thought, I've got seven weeks off filming TOWIE and I thought, "What am I going to do?"', she said.

'I'm going to go to bootcamp, I want to 
get really healthy and the only thing that's worked for me is basically 
cutting all process foods. There is so much food out there high in 
sugar, fat and salt.

Looking good: Gemma revealed that she has tried every diet but simply going back to basics and cutting out processed meals is the only method that's worked for her

Speaking out: Gemma was speaking on the show about beach body diets ahead of her trip to Marbella with the TOWIE cast

'If you just take it back to basics, 
yes, it's going to take longer but if you prepare your food from 
scratch and cut out fizzy drinks, I know it sounds cliche, but that's 
what has worked for me.'

Committed Gemma recently spent time at No.1 Bootcamp in Norfolk, a favourite of Binky Felstead and Spencer Matthews.

The plus-size designer tweeted: 'Had the most wonderful day now off to @no1bootcamp to shake my booty for the bank holiday no partying for moi!'

It
 seems that Gemma was throwing herself wholeheartedly into the regime, 
later tweeting: '3 mile run BOOM shak a lak @no1bootcamp @gardenerskbar 
NO CARBS BEFORE MARBS'.

Radiant: Gemma's healthy new regime is certainly working wonders, the TOWIE designer looked positively radiant as she sat on the Good Morning Britain sofa today

Wise words: 'If you prepare your food from scratch and cut out fizzy drinks, I know it sounds cliche, but that's what has worked for me,' Gemma told Good Morning Britain

She knows what she's talking about: 'The only thing that's worked for me is basically cutting all process foods. There is so much food out there high in sugar, fat and salt,' Gemma said today

No carbs before Marbs! Gemma has used her time off filming to embark on a healthy new regime - and it's certainly paid off

She added: 'From trying every diet to every diet pill, you just pull your hair out. If anything, from all those diets, I just got bigger.

'In six weeks, I've managed to lose 1st 8lbs, I feel really, really good right now and I'm just going to keep going.'

'Everyone out there wants to lose 
weight, it's a big thing now. When you go into a supermarket, it's 
cheaper to buy a family-made lasagna than it is to buy fresh meat and vegetables, it's just quick on-the-go eating.

'For me, I didn't want to be a fad dieter anymore so I thought "What can I do to change my life?"'.

A spokesperson for No. 1 Bootcamp told MailOnline: 'Gemma popped out from No 1 Boot Camp to film Good Morning Britain and sort out a few other business commitments.

'She is coming straight back this week to continue her preparation for the TOWIE Marbella special.

'She was also here three weeks ago, again preparing for Marbella.

'So far she has lost 1 st 8lbs but she still has a fair way to go before she will have the bikini body she wants for the big Marbella "reveal"'.

Miles ahead! Clearly keen to get in shape ahead of the casts' trip to Marbella, committed Gemma checked into No.1 Bootcamp in Norfolk

Training hard: Gemma, pictured with her TOWIE co-star Lewis Bloor at No. 1 Boot camp, says she has upped her exercise regime

Long way to go: A spokesperson for the bootcamp said Gemma will return to get in shape for her Marbella "big reveal"

Well done, Gemma! Miss Collins may not have enjoyed her time at Slimmeria but the designer decided to give bootcamp another go, this time in Norfolk

Speaking to MailOnline, Gemma revealed: 'We're heading to Marbella in seven weeks, it's going to be amazing, watch this space.

'Let's just say, I'm going wild in Marbella!'

And it seems that Romford's 
finest fashionista has reason to celebrate. Last week she won the 'Editor's Choice' award at the 
Reveal Magazine Online Fashion Awards, where she was hailed a 'role 
model' for the industry.

Gemma is most certainly making waves in the fashion industry after 
scooping her second award in less than a year for her plus-size fashion 
collection - the bubbly blonde was named plus-size designer of the year, too.
