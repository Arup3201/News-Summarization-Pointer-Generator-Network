India's tour match against a Cricket Australia XI due to commence in Adelaide on Friday has been postponed following the sad death of Phillip Hughes.

The game at the Adelaide Oval, the home of South Australia, was India's second and final warm-up for the four-Test series against Australia beginning in Brisbane on December 4. 

Hughes died on Thursday afternoon aged 25, two days after being struck on the head by a bouncer while playing in a Sheffield Shield game for South Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Cricket Australia tweeted: 'The CA XI v India match at Adelaide Oval has now been cancelled. It was scheduled for Fri-Sat, then moved to Sat-Sun but now abandoned.

'The Indian team will train in the Adelaide Oval nets on Friday but not on the ground proper, as a mark of respect to Phillip Hughes.'

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) tweeted: 'Our condolences and prayers with Phil Hughes' family. May his soul rest in peace.'

However, England's one-day international against Sri Lanka in Colombo will go ahead on Saturday.

There will be a minutes silence before play and the teams will wear black armbands. 

The England and Australia matches at the Blind Cricket World Cup that were scheduled for Thursday have been cancelled.

Pakistan's Test against New Zealand in Sharjah was also abandoned for the day. 

The Indian team will continue to practise in the nets but will not use the main ground at the Adelaide Oval

The four-Test series between India and Australia is due to begin at the Gabba in Brisbane on December 4 before the second Test at the Adelaide Oval on December 12.

The teams will then move on to the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before ending the series with the New Year Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

A one-day triangular series also involving England is then due to take place in January before the World Cup commences in February.

The Australian rugby union team will decide later on Thursday whether they will wear black armbands or request a minutes silence in memory of Hughes at Twickenham on Saturday.
