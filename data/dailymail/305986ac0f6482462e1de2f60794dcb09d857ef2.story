Newly-released videos have revealed the chaotic, last minutes of a team of 'hotshot' firefighters before they were killed while battling the Yarnell Hill Fire in June 2013.

The Arizona State Forestry Division posted the clips on its website this week that were recorded by other firefighters on the day that 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots died.  

Some footage, including that which showed the bodies of the Granite Mountain crew, was redacted by the Forest Service.

The clips revealed the immense danger being faced by the hotshots as they were surrounded by walls of fast-moving flames and 2000F heat.

Videos released this week revealed the chaotic last-minute attempts to save 19 firefighters (some are pictured here) on Granite Mountain before they were consumed by 2000F heat and walls of fire

Winds from a thunderstorm fanned flames towards the crew and made communicating difficult and patchy.

At one point, another firefighter is heard asking for the cell phone number of a hotshot because he is having trouble reaching him via radio, CBS reported. 

The clips range from 30 seconds to more than seven minutes. They include one previously released clip that showed firefighters listening to radio traffic between the Granite Mountain crew and command staff. 

The crew seemed puzzled about what was going on. One said he thought the crew was in a safety zone. 

On one of the last transmissions from the hotshots came from Eric Marsh, the superintendent of the Granite Mountain crew, who is heard saying: 'Our escape route has been cut off. We are preparing a deployment site and we are burning out around ourselves in the brush and I'll give you a call when we are under ... the shelters.'

The clip ended with command staffers trying repeatedly to reach the crew by radio. The calls go unanswered.

Other videos showed firefighters planning their attempt to rescue the Granite Mountain crew and making their way to the area.

Once the bodies were found, the emotion in the clips is apparent. At one point, a voice utters a profanity and confirms that the bodies of the crew have been found.

Another voice is heard over the radio, reporting solemnly that there were no survivors. A rescuer said: 'Yeah Todd, on scene. 18 confirmed.'

A total of 19 firefighters died, making the tragedy the deadly blaze marked the greatest loss of life from a U.S. wildfire since 1933. 

As other fire crews made it to where the 19 'hotshots' had been fighting the blaze, one voice can be heard on the radio saying: 'Yeah Todd on scene. 18 confirmed'. 19 firefighters in total died

Roxanne Warneke, whose husband, Billy Warneke, was one of the 19 men killed, watched the videos in her Marana home. For her, there still are questions.

In one clip, a man's voice is heard saying: 'I don't have anybody else that I feel comfortable sending that way.'

Mrs Warneke said that sounds as if someone had specifically sent the Granite Mountain crew into the area where they were trapped and killed.

'We'll never understand. We will always ask why,' said Tammy Misner of Santa Ynez, California, whose son, Sean Misner, was a Granite Mountain hotshot.

Mrs Misner heard the bewilderment, the fear and then sadness in the men's voices as she watched the videos, which include images recorded before the hotshots were overcome and after their bodies were found.

She said: 'It was just disturbing to look at and watch, but at the same time I don't think I heard anything that would make any changes to what we already feel we know happened.

'You're watching this, and you know what's going on. Our guys are gone.'

Attorney Patrick McGroder, who represents families of the fallen hotshots in wrongful-death and benefit legal cases, had not seen the footage.

He criticized the forestry division's handling of the release, saying officials were insensitive and lacked decency.

A few weeks ago, families of the Granite Mountain Hotshots had been warned by J.P. Vicente, a Prescott fire captain, that the videos might be released. 

Families had asked that no footage of the bodies of their loved ones or photographs be made public.
