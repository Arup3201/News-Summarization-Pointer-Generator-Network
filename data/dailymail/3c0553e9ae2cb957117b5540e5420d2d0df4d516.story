Top job: Helle Thorning-Schmidt is backed by Cameron in bid to be the next President of Europe

David Cameron is willing to back Neil Kinnock’s daughter-in-law in her bid to become the next President of Europe at crunch talks in Brussels today.

Government sources last night said Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is one of a handful of leaders he thinks he could work with as he tries to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the European Union.

She is best known here for posing for a flirtatious selfie photograph with Mr Cameron and Barack Obama at Nelson Mandela’s funeral earlier this year.

She leads Denmark’s social democrats and is married to Lord Kinnock’s son Stephen.

A Government source said the 47-year-old had forged a ‘very strong relationship’ with Mr Cameron and could ‘work with us on the reforms we seek in Europe’. 

The Prime Minister is also expected to hold talks today with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker about securing a senior post for his controversial candidate Lord Hill of Oareford. 

Britain is demanding a major economic portfolio in the new European Commission, despite Lord Hill’s low profile.

But Mr Juncker has warned Mr Cameron and other EU leaders that he plans to give most of the best jobs to women in order to improve the Commission’s gender balance. 

EU leaders will gather in Brussels to decide who will replace Herman van Rompuy as President of the European Council. A replacement for the EU’s foreign affairs chief baroness Ashton is also likely to be decided.

None of the candidates for the presidency have publicly declared their hand, not least because most are already holding public office.

But the leading candidates are understood to be Miss Thorning-Schmidt, the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, the Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and the former Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, who is emerging as a possible compromise candidate.

Government sources last night said Mr Cameron could work with all the leading candidates for the job, despite having clashed with Mr Tusk over Britain’s demands for curbs to the free movement of workers in Europe.

Pawel Swidlicki, of the think tank Open Europe, said the choice of European president was critical to Mr Cameron’s hopes of securing major reforms ahead of an In/Out referendum planned for 2017.

He said: ‘The European Council President will play a crucial role in brokering David Cameron’s potential EU re-negotiation. Therefore, London should invest most of its political capital securing an honest broker for Council president and a leading job in the next European Commission for Lord Hill - such as the internal market or competition portfolios.’

Diplomatic sources said Italian foreign minister Federica Mogherini is emerging as the favourite to replace Baroness Ashton, despite criticism that she is ‘too soft’ on Russia.

Mr Cameron appears to have abandoned hopes of blocking her appointment, but officials insisted her personal views were of little importance as it is EU leaders who dictate foreign policy.
