He 
explains: 'I bought my first reflex camera soon after I arrived here; it
 is this city that made me want to do photography. Living in an 
urbanised place, I naturally specialised myself in cityscape and 
architecture shots.'

Romain explains that he had great feedback after releasing the fist book and was able to exhibit his work for the first time.

'Somehow
 in April or May in 2013 my photos went viral on the internet. Then I 
was contacted by press from all around the world and my photos were 
featured in major publications in the UK, France, Spain and many other

square-miles, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated areas in 
the world.
