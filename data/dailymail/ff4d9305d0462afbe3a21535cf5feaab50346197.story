Labour's plans for a mansion tax have been attacked by critics who say middle class families and pensioners will be hit in the pocket more than the super-rich who are the intended target.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls told the party’s conference in Manchester that the measure would only hit houses worth more than £2million.

But with property prices having shot up in the past decade, families who moved into relatively affordable homes could suddenly face huge tax bills because their home has increased in value – even if their income has not.

According to figures from the Halifax House Price Index, a property in Greater London bought for£500,000 in 1994, would now, 20 years later, be worth £2,056,381 - a rise of more than 311 per cent.

And according to the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, almost one third of properties worth more than £2million have been owned by the same people for more than a decade, and around a sixth for more than 20 years.

Greg Hands, Conservative MP for Chelsea and Fulham, today told MailOnline a mansion tax would be more accurately described as a 'homes tax'.

In Stoke Newington this five-bedroom semi-detached home would set buyers back £2million. A neighbouring home which sold for £750,000 in 2006 is now estimated to be worth £2,396,310. If property values continue to grow at the rate seen over the last ten years, homes now worth £1.2million would cross the £2million threshold by 2023.

In Islington a four-bedroom terraced property was on sale for £2,000,000. A similar house on the same street sold for £430,000 in 1999, and is now estimated to be worth £2,036,764.  Conservative MP Greg Hands said: 'Elderly people would find it impossible to pay amounts of up to £30,000 per annum to live in their family home which in many cases they have been in for 30 years or more.'

In Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, a Victorian five-bed home, spread over three floors and close to Richmond Park, was on the market for £2,200,000. The idea of a mansion tax has been pushed by Liberal Democrat MP and Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills Vince Cable, who proposed that any home worth more than £2million would be taxed at an annual rate of one per cent of its value above that threshold.

In Oxford, semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city, where homes sold for around £400,000 in the mid-90s, are on sale for more than £2million. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value.

A four-bedroom semi-detached riverside home in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was being sold with a guide price of £2,000,000, in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years. There are also fears that, if the tax is introduced, the threshold could later be reduced as an easy way of boosting Government revenue.

In Teddington, Middlesex, this four-bedroom detached home is on sale for £2,100,000. Property agents Knight Frank have also estimated that the majority of the homes affected by a potential mansion tax are located in the south east and London, meaning homeowners in the region would be subsidising services across the country.A spokesman said: 'There are approximately 110,000 £2million properties in the UK, 86.4per cent of which are located in London and the south east of England. Assuming Labour forecasts are accurate, residents in these two English regions will be responsible for an additional £1.04bn in tax funding for the UK's NHS service.'

Ed Miliband's own home near Hampstead Heath, was bought in his then girlfriend, now wife Justine Thornton's name in 2009 for £1.6million, but is now thought to be worth around £2million. Mr Balls's home in the more modest Stamford Hill area of Hackney, East London, which he shares with wife and fellow MP Yvette Cooper and their three children, is thought to be worth around £650,000.

A three-bedroom detached house in Heddon-On-The-Wall, outside Newcastle Upon Tyne is on sale for £2.2m. There are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value, having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry.

Offers of around £2million are being taken for a four-bedroom farmhouse near Tregony in South Cornwall, an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009. It could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the UK, and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky-rocketed and who now have a low-income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax.

A recently-built home in sought-after Alderley Edge in Cheshire is on the market priced at £2million. Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills, said the effect would be unknown until Labour confirmed the percentage of tax charged. He said: 'Prices have risen by 530per cent in London, but in the rest of the country it's gone up by 200per cent and that market has disproportionately performed.

For just under the £2million threshold, a six-bedroom Victorian villa in the highly-desirable Morningside area of Edinburgh is taking offers of around £1.95million. Sales of the country's most expensive homes, around 1.6per cent of the total market, already provide 26per cent of all stamp duty land tax, and the top 0.7per cent contributes 36per cent of the amount received in inheritance tax on homes.

In Glasgow, a four-storey home, built for Saracen Foundry founder Walter MacFarlane is listed as being open to offers of more than £2,000,000. As well as being suitable for a private home, the building is also described as being suitable for an art gallery or a library. The value of the property dwarfs that of surrounding homes, which have an average sale price of £485,640, but this has risen by £20,480 in the last five years.

Just outside Glasgow, a four-bedroom former farm house is on sale with a guide price of £2,100,000. The property, which was completely rebuilt in 1999, boasts five acres of formal gardens and an open plan design. Other homes in the surrounding area have seen their value rise by an average of 2.88per cent in the last year.

Looking out onto the highly sought-after Sandbanks Penninsula in Dorset, this four bedroom property is on sale for £2,175,000. The area is popular with many wealthy celebrities, and homes regularly sell for more than £2million, with average prices rising by 13.6 per cent in the last five years.

A guide price of £2,095,000 would buy this four-bedroom farmhouse near Ilkley, West Yorkshire, which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa. Homes in the area sell for an average of £962,016, an increase of 12 per cent from 2009. Critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued, which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost.

This six-bedroom detached house in Formby, Merseyside is on sale for £2million, and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room. Average prices on the street currently stand at £910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago. A neighbouring ten-bedroom property sold for £2million in 2005, and is now thought to be worth £2,152,966.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, pictured with Ed Miliband, confirmed that Labour would introduce a 'mansion tax' on the 'highest-value properties', and plough the money back into public services such as the NHS
