A council spent £338,000 on private education for just one disabled boy in the last academic year, it can be revealed.

Authorities paid £525million to teach nearly 11,500 youngsters with special needs in independent schools nationwide - which works out at nearly £46,000 per child.

Disabled children educated privately have either severe physical disabilities, behavioural problems, emotional difficulties or suffer from severe autism.

Private sector: Councils paid £525million to educate 11,500 children in independent schools in the last academic year. While some authorities were able to educate the majority of pupils in their own schools, others racked up large bills putting children in private schools

But while some authorities are able to teach youngsters in their own state-run special schools, others hand thousands of pounds over to the private sector instead.

Critics have said this is often not in the child's or the parents' best interests because the special schools can be a long way from home.

Campaign groups also questioned whether local authorities are getting good value because of the huge annual bills.

Wiltshire Council paid £338,000 to educate one disabled boy in a secondary school last year, according to the figures released to MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act.

The money pays for the child's education, transport and day-to-day healthcare costs.

Responses from 124 local education authorities revealed 11,459 special needs pupils were educated privately last year.

Reading Borough Council paid £307,183 to educate one male pupil in a secondary school while Merton Council, in London, spent £304,272 on secondary education for a child.

In contrast, Wolverhampton City Council managed to educate 31 pupils privately at a cost of £1,730,965.

The most they paid for education was £90,241 to teach a secondary school boy - less than a third of the bills elsewhere.

The huge disparity in the cost of private
school places for disabled children was seized upon by critics as 
evidence that some authorities are not getting good value for money.

Chris McGovern, chairman for the 
Campaign for Real Education, said the figures show some local education 
authorities are overspending on private schools for children with 
special needs.

‘There are 
some children who need 24-hour care, some of whom are autistic children,
and it is right that resources are devoted to looking after these 
people,’ he said.

‘The 
figures suggest that while some authorities can look after 
children “in house” others are having to outsource to the private 
sector.

‘Huge discrepancies 
between the amount of money local authorities are spending on education 
for children with special needs would suggest some are relying too heavily 
on private providers.

'This is obviously going to be more expensive for the taxpayer.

‘These
discrepancies should not exist – local authorities need to get value 
for money. Councils have to weigh up getting good value for money and 
providing the best possible care.’

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of 
the Taxpayers' Alliance said: 'It’s important that pupils with special 
education needs have access to teaching that caters for their 
requirements.

'But carting a
select few pupils off to private school is neither good value for 
taxpayers’ money nor does it improve special education provisions in 
mainstream schools.

'Local 
schools should be able to cater for all pupils rather just those who 
don’t meet requirements that mean they get sent elsewhere.

A spokesman for Wiltshire Council defended sending children with special needs to private school and said they were working to reduce the cost to the taxpayer.

'Since 2006 the number of placements of children in independent schools has fallen from well over 140 to between 80 and 90 depending on the time of the year,' he said.

'This has resulted in savings of over £2million being made from the Dedicated Schools Grant, which has been re-invested in local schools to improve the special educational needs provision available.

'The needs of some children are so complex and specialised that we will never be in a position to meet them completely within the county, and a single specialist school would not cover the needs of every child.

'However, we have developed robust procedures to monitor all  plans to ensure these children and their families receive the best possible support.'

A spokesman from the Department for Education said it was for individual councils to decide how best to educate disabled children.

'Children with special educational needs should be educated in a school which can meet their needs. It is for councils to make decisions about placements based on the individual needs of the child,' he said.

'Special free schools and academies are giving parents of children with SEN more choice within the state sector, with open and approved special free schools providing more than 1,100 places.'
