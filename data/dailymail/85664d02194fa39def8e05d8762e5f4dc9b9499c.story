At first glance they look like scenes from one of the most dramatic train journeys ever made.

But no passengers were on board to enjoy the stunning scenery as the locomotive involved was just a two-inch high model.

Photographer Jeff Friesen placed the replica 1955 Canadian Pacific Railways 'Streamliner' at different locations across Canada to showcase the country's incredible natural beauty.

Miniature: The view from this train as it travels through Five Islands, Nova Scotia, in Canada, is spectacular - but sadly no passengers will be enjoying it as it is just a two-inch high model

Soaking: The train, seen here teetering on a branch at Luskville Falls, in Gatineau Park, Quebec, was taken on a tour of Canada by its owner Jeff Friesen

Dramatic: Mr Friesen used the model train - pictured here on a farm near Brandon, Manitoba - to showcase Canada's breathtaking natural beauty

From a dramatic stone outcrop skirting the sea in Five Islands, Nova Scotia, to a field of corn in Manitoba, the incredible images show the huge contrasts in landscapes across Canada.

To the untrained eye the train looks to be moving through the countryside, often on some of the most inhospitable terrain.

Giveaways of the train's true size include a tree root pictured arching over the track in Rock Lake, Algonquin Provincial Park, in Ontario and the wooden rail of a bird viewing platform in Chaplin, Saskatchewan.Â 

Lake view: the 1955 vintage model appears to be travelling across the water as it skirts the shore of Lake Louise, Banff National Park, in Alberta

Fog Forest: In this image the 'Canadian Pacific' train is seen apparently climbing a moss-laden hill as a huge waterfall thunders beside it. The photo was taken in Fundy National Park, near Alma, New Brunswick

'Golden Harvest: They may look like trees but in this picture the train is seen weaving through a field of corn on the outskirts of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada

Mr Friesen said his work, entitled The Canadian: Ghost Train Crossing 
Canada, evolved from his wish to showcase his native country.

'I started The Canadian project to show Canada from an unexpected vantage point,' he said.

'The
journey has a surprise twist: I carry the train rather than it carrying
me. At just two inches tall, it fits into a shopping bag.

'While it is tempting to document such a huge country from a 
helicopter or plane (in fact, it has been done several times) I wanted 
to get closer to the heart of the land. Two inches off the ground seemed
about right.'

'Algonquin Morning': A tree root arches over the track as the train is pictured on the shore of Rock Lake, Algonquin Provincial Park, in Ontario

'Prairie Skyway': It looks like a huge wooden bridge, but in fact this picture shows the train perched on a a bird watching tower near the town of Chaplin, Saskatchewan

Rocky terrain: The model is shown disappearing into what looks like a mountain tunnel on the shore of Lake Huron in Bruce Peninsula National Park, Ontario

Mr Friesen said the model train 
provides 'a vehicle for the journey's visual narrative, linking far 
places with a ribbon of tiny steel rails.'

The
model is an exact scaled-down replica of the 1955 Streamliner that was 
first named 'The Canadian,' which travelled the route between Montreal 
and Vancouver.

'There is some peril in introducing a model train to the full scale 
world,' said Mr Friesen.

'The Crossing': The train is partly obscured as it sits under a waterfall in Black Brook Beach, Ingonish, Nova Scotia

'Salish Sea': A pile of what looks like driftwood provides part of the dramatic backdrop to this photograph on Dallas Road Beach, Victoria, in British Columbia

'Totem Forest': The blurry image of a totem pole can be seen overlooking the model as it appears to be travelling over rocky terrain in Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia

The train fell
into a fast moving stream in Nova Scotia while in Algonquin Park, Ontario, it tumbled 
from a log into a marsh of 'thick mud and dark water.'

'I had to 
feel for the train in the bog's murky depths,' said Mr Friesen.

The photos will be particularly interesting for model train enthusiasts - most of whom could only dream of running their miniature collections through such dramatic scenery.

'Early Autumn': The autumnal shades on the distant trees are captured by the sun in this beautiful image taken at Taylor Lake, Gatineau Park, in Quebec

'Tree Bridge': the train looks to be making its way over a moss-covered log in this picture, taken in La Mauricie National Park, Quebec

Mystical: These small stones are made to look like huge rocky outcrops by the model train as it was balances on a log in Cape Breton Highlands National Park, Nova Scotia

'High Water': The 'Streamliner' looks to be ploughing through the water in this picture taken at Roche Lake Provincial Park, near Kamloops, British Columbia
