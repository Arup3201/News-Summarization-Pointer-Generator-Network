An Arizona entrepreneur, his wife and daughter were killed when their home-built airplane crashed in a San Diego nature preserve as they returned home from a family vacation.

Medical examiners said on Sunday that the owner of the plane was 65-year-old William A. Stern, who was piloting the four-seat Lancair IV-P aircraft when it crashed just north of Santee, California.

His 53-year-old wife, Jennifer Jane Sterm, was found in the front passenger seat, and his 19-year-old daughter Katelyn Jane Stern was in the back passenger seat.

Mr Stern is the owner of Stern Produce, a family-owned and operated food supplier in Arizona.

In a statement to KSAZ-TV, Mr Stern's son Billy, who was not aboard the doomed plane, said: 'On Saturday, Stern Produce Company lost a great leader.'

He added that he would take the reigns of the company and 'while our hearts are heavy, we will continue in the direction set forth by Bill.'

Stern Produce, which was founded by Mr Stern's grandfather in 1917, is a top supplier of food items to Arizona restaurants, according to The Arizona Republic.

Witnesses saw the single-engine plane go down and strike a hillside Saturday in the Sycamore Canyon Open Space Preserve.

FAA spokesman Ian Gregor says the plane had departed from San Diego's Montgomery Field en route to Deer Valley Airport in Phoenix.
