A federal judge has lifted a temporary restraining order that had stopped the U.S. military from force feeding a hunger-striking prisoner at Guantanamo Bay naval base, saying the man's life hangs in the balance.

U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler said the military must be allowed to carry out force feeding in the case of Abu Wa'el Dhiab because of the 'very real probability that Mr. Dhiab will die.'

Abu Wa'el Dhiab was rapidly deteriorating
 and she would not reissue a temporary order from last week that stopped
 the military from force-feeding him.

Lawyers for Dhiab are challenging force feeding during the hunger strike as abusive.

Dhiab's lawyers have argued that the 
practice of forcibly extracting him and other prisoners from their 
cells, restraining them and feeding them through a tube inserted into 
their noses, was also illegal.

The Defense Department has said the military only feeds prisoners against their will to keep them alive, and follows all laws when it does so.

Kessler says the detainee is willing to be fed at a hospital at Guantanamo Bay if he can be spared what the judge calls the agony of having feeding tubes inserted and removed for each feeding.

The judge says the Defense Department refused to make any compromise from current procedure.

On Wednesday, the judge brushed aside the Justice Department's objections and ordered the government to produce 34 videotapes that show Dhiab being forcibly removed from his cell, followed by force feeding the hunger-striking prisoner.

Earlier this week, Kessler said she urged
 the government and Dhiab's lawyers to reach a compromise on the 
procedure used to feed Dhiab, but that the Defense Department has 'refused to make these compromises.'

In her order Thursday night, she said the court will move quickly in the case to consider the merits. Kessler issued the temporary restraining order a week ago.

'The court is now faced with an anguishing Hobson's choice,' Kessler said, in lifting the temporary restraining order.

U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler ordered the administration to preserve and turn over the videotapes of the forced feeding of detainee Mohammed Abu Wa'el Dhiab

If she issues another temporary order to stop the forced feeding, Dhiab probably will die, the judge said.

Alternatively, allowing the force feeding possibly will result in great pain and suffering, she added.

Lieutenant Colonel Todd Breasseale, a Pentagon spokesman, said: 'As the court has asserted, this is a deeply complex issue.

The Department has long held that we shall not allow the detainees in our charge to commit suicide and it's particularly worth noting here that we only apply enteral feeding in order to preserve life.'

Enteral feeding refers to the delivery of a nutritionally complete food directly into the stomach or small bowel of a person suffering from or at risk of malnutrition.

Prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay naval base have engaged in hunger strikes for years, but only won the right to challenge in U.S. courts the military's practices of forcing them to eat in February.

Dhiab's lawyers are ultimately seeking an order that would force the military to change the practices.

On Wednesday, Kessler ordered the government to turn over more than 30 videos of Dhiab's feedings, some of his 2013 medical records, and the protocols the military uses to force-feed prisoners.

Former inmates have described a feeding process in which detainees who do not wish to be force-fed are restrained, sometimes violently, and taken to a force-feeding chair
