This is the terrifying moment an innocent taxi driver was bitten and punched in a frenzied, unprovoked attack by a drunken passenger.

Leigh Curtis, 52, was left with cuts and 
bruising, a broken nose, broken ribs and needing stitches to two 
fingers, after being bitten so hard it hit the bone.

His attacker, 43-year-old James Pilgrim,
was today sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison at Lewes 
Crown Court for one count assault occasioning actual bodily harm and 
possession of cannabis.

Horrifying: Pilgrim, who was drunk at the time, appears to lean in to bite Mr Curtis who looks to be stunned

Request: Taxi driver Leigh Curtis (pictured on the left in this CCTV footage from his cab) discusses the fare with passenger James Pilgrim - who had seemed calm beforehand

Attack: Pilgrim leans over and grabs Mr Curtis as he launches the vicious assault on the taxi driver

Pain: The taxi driver struggles to restrain Pilgrim as he continues to throw punches

Mr Curtis, from Hastings in Sussex has been a taxi driver for 32 years 
and was working a night shift just after midnight on July 17 this year 
when he was subjected to the frenzied attack.

He said: ‘He didn’t say a word throughout the whole journey, usually people do make idle chit chat.‘When we were nearing where he wanted to go he said he didn’t have any money.

‘I radioed the office and they said he was known and had used our taxis before so it would be OK.

‘I told him not to worry, that these things happen and to go into the office to pay at a later date.

‘The next thing I knew he lunged forward and was trying to bite my neck and my ear - he was pulling me backwards.

Injured: Mr Curtis suffered a broken nose, cracked ribs and was bitten in the unprovoked assault. He now suffers nightmares and flashbacks of the violence and cannot bring himself to drive a taxi again

Black eye: The taxi-driver was shocked by the ferocity of the attack. He said taxi drivers often face abuse while doing their job

‘I thought he was going to kill me, and if he had had a knife he probably would have done.

‘Then he got out the cab and head-butted me and tried to pull me through the driver’s window.

‘I thought he was on drugs, normal people don’t just fly off the handle like that.'

Mr Curtis said there was nothing leading up to the attack.

The assault was captured on CCTV cameras installed in the vehicle which was instrumental in the conviction of Pilgrim.

During sentencing the shocking footage was played to the court and Pilgrim can be clearly seen to suddenly ‘flip’ launching a vile and foul-mouthed tirade of abuse at Mr Curtis before physically beating him.

Towards the end of the clip Mr Curtis can be heard shouting ‘help me’. It has since emerged Pilgrim had been drinking with friends all day and estimates he had drunk ten pints of strong lager.

Prosecuting Charmaine Wilson said: ‘The dispute centres in the taxi when he was agreed he would make a payment at a later date.

Painful: Mr Curtis received deep bite marks to his fingers while fending Pilgrim off

‘He was calm at that time until he dropped his bottle of wine getting out of the vehicle.

‘We have seen the evidence and in his statement Mr Curtis describes being punched in the face several times, headbutted several times and when he put his hands in front of his face to defend himself Pilgrim bit his fingers until they bled.’

Defending Laura Plant said Pilgrim could not bear to watch the video when being interviewed by the police and that he was on medication for depression.Mr Curtis’ firm, 247 taxis in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, have 100 vehicles and have installed CCTV at £500 a time in all of them because of previous abuse.

Mr Curtis said the attack was 'serious' and that if had happened to someone young or older things could have been much worse.

Jailed: James Pilgrim, 43, arrives at Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex. He was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for the assault. No order was made for compensation because he is on benefits

‘People don’t realise what taxi drivers have to put up with,' he said.

‘I have been threatened countless times over the years put you just drive away and try to forget about it.

‘We aren’t trying to hurt anybody we are just doing a job but the people we deal with are largely drunk and in recent times more people are on drugs.’

The brutal assault only came to an end when the handbrake was released in the struggle causing the car to roll backwards colliding with parked vehicles.

The impact caused Pilgrim to release his grip.

Mr Curtis managed to restrain him and he was arrested at the scene.

He still suffers flashbacks and insomnia caused by post-traumatic stress and doubts if he will ever be able to return to work in a taxi.

Sentencing Judge Charles Kemp said: ‘I have seen, as you have the video footage from the CCTV in Mr Curtis’ taxi cab and chilling it is.

‘You were that night drinking with friends, you don’t normally drink such a huge quantity of alcohol, you estimate you had seven to 10 pints of strong lager.

‘You were carrying a bottle of wine and said you had no money to pay the fare.

‘He agreed reasonably you could go into the office at a later date.

‘The exchange was perfectly calm and reasonable.

‘You then dropped a bottle of wine and broke it.

‘You then launched into a vicious and repeated attack with Mr Curtis and the driver’s seat of the cab.

‘You screamed abuse at him. You punched him, head-butted him and bit his fingers.

‘You got into the back of the vehicle and went for him from behind, trying to throttle him while screaming foul and abusive language in his direction.’

He added six members of the public had called the police that night.

Pilgrim was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, no order was made for compensation because he is on benefits.
