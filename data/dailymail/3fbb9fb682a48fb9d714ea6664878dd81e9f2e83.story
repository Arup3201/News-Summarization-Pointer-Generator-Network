Stoke City have made an official complaint to the BBC after John Hartson said Victor Moses ‘cheated’ to win a penalty during Swansea’s defeat at the Britannia.

The club are furious at the language used by Hartson, the former Wales striker, when assessing the encounter on Match of the Day 2 on Sunday night.

Peter Coates, the Stoke chairman, branded Hartson’s comments ‘disgraceful’ and insisted Moses’s fall following contact from Angel Rangel warranted a spot-kick.

Garry Monk, the Swansea manager, is expected to be charged by the FA on Tuesday for his enraged post-match statements and criticism of official Michael Oliver.

‘For John Hartson and Garry Monk to call Moses a cheat is disgraceful,’ said Coates. ‘He didn’t cheat, he’s not a cheat and we firmly believe those comments crossed the line.

‘I thought Mark Hughes dealt with the matter well after the game but when Hartson made his comments on the Sunday night we couldn’t let it go.

‘I’ve never heard such a more one-sided view from a pundit and there was a total lack of objectivity. Hartson is a big fan of Swansea and their manager and it showed.

‘We’ve made a complaint and we’ll have to see if we get any feedback from them. We’ve also asked the FA to keep us informed. There comes a time when you have to take a stand.’
