NBC is planning a competition show with a grand prize that's out of this world: a ride into space.

The network said on Thursday it is teaming with Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and veteran TV producer Mark Burnett on Space Race, a competition where the winner gets a ride on the space liner that is expected to begin commercial flights sometime next year.

NBC offered no estimate on when Space Race would air.

Richard Branson aimed to bring clients into space by 2014, when Virgin Galactic is due to kick off

'The term "trip of a lifetime" has for once been delivered on,' said Paul Telegdy, NBC's president of alternative and late-night programming.

'This will be a remarkable experience for anyone who has looked at the night's sky and dared to dream of space flight.'

Virgin has been testing its 
rocket-powered space vehicle this year, with pilots reaching a height of
69,000 feet on a September 5 flight that landed in the Mojave Desert 
near Virgin Galactic's facility there. Virgin has said the goal is to 
begin commercial flights next year, with Branson and his family taking 
the first ride.Â 

Behind the scenes is Mark Burnett, who became a big deal after coming up with the hit Survivor

Virgin has already collected $80 million in deposits from 640 people interested in experiencing the weightlessness of space.

A
TV show could be great publicity for Branson's company. Competitors, 
such as billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX, are also working to
make commercial spaceflight a reality.

Burnett, the producer behind The Voice
and Survivor, said he has wanted for 10 years to make a show with the 
goal of letting an average person experience looking down on Earth from 
the black sky of space.

He 
wasn't immediately available Thursday to talk about how the show will be
structured. He has made the finales of Survivor and The Voice live 
television events, and it is unsure whether a winner's ride on Space 
Race could be televised live.

NBC and other broadcast networks have been
pushing for more live 'events' that can become sensations on social 
media.

He promised, though, that 'viewers at home will have a first-class seat.'

Another businessman, namely Elon Musk, is behind a competing brand: SpaceX, a company with billions of dollars behind it
