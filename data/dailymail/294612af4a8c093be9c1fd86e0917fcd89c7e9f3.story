Case: Nursery assistant Kyshia Cammock was sacked for smacking her own daughter at work and is suing for unfair dismissal

A nursery assistant is claiming unfair dismissal after she was sacked for smacking her own daughter at work.

Kyshia Cammock, 25, lost her job at Little Folks Nursery in Birmingham after she hit her two-year-old on the bottom for misbehaving, a tribunal was told.

The mother is suing her former employers, Mishi Nurseries Ltd, for unfair dismissal and seeking compensation.

But Mishi Nurseries is fighting the claim and maintains Miss Cammock was sacked for gross misconduct after the incident, which is against company policy.

The police were informed at the time, the hearing was told, but no action was taken.

Miss Cammock was on a training scheme at the centre.

She has accused her employers of favouritism among staff, claiming she had been treated less favourably than others.

At the hearing, Miss Cammock said she had been told by management not to deny the smacking accusation because there had been CCTV footage. But it was revealed there was no such footage.

Tribunal judge Victoria Dean said she could not find any reference in a witness statement by Miss Cammock that acknowledged she knew about the firm’s policy against smacking children on the premises.

But Miss Cammock said during the hearing: 'I knew I was not allowed to smack a child.'

The nursery owners claimed the member of staff had been fully aware of the firm’s 'behaviour policy' regarding staff.

The case was adjourned to a later date, to allow more evidence to be provided.

Miss Cammock has yet to give verbal evidence.
