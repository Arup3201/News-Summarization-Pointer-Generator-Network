Cricket Australia has decided to trademark the phrase ‘63 not out’ to prevent people from cashing in on the death of Australian cricketer Philip Hughes.

Tributes have flowed for Hughes since his death on November 25 when he was hit in the head by a Sean Abbott bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The batsman will again be in everyone's thoughts as the Boxing Day Test starts in Melbourne today. In what has been an emotional series for the home team because of Hughes' death, they go into the encounter leading the series 2-0.

Hughes was on a score of 63 not out when the tragedy occurred and that number has been immortalised in Australia since then. However, to stop those out to make a quick profit from of it all Cricket Australia applied to have the phrase ‘63 not out’ trademarked under the name, and an agreement was reached.

To preserve the memory of Philip Hughes Cricket Australia has decided to trademark the phrase ‘63 not out’

Since Hughes' death merchandise has already been on sale online featuring the phrase 

The move came after representatives of Cricket Australia and its legal representatives K & L Gates had discussions with Hughes' family and management last week to prevent potential unlicensed memorabilia.

The West Australian reported that the agreement will cover several classes of goods and services including clothing and other memorabilia. It now means Cricket Australia controls the use of the phrase on all merchandise - a move they say was purely ‘defensive’.

‘Cricket Australia registered the trade mark in conjunction with Phillip's management purely as a defensive registration to prevent others trying to exploit Phillip's memory,’ a spokesman said.

‘There was some evidence of that starting to occur which is why we have taken this action.’  

Hughes will again be with his team mates in spirit when they play the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne today

Cricket Australia's main concern was unlicensed memorabilia. Merchandise relating to Hughes has been on sale online with T-shirts and stickers featuring the phrase already being sold, along with plaques detailing Hughes' career stats - including his final innings.

It has been a difficult period for the Australian team since Hughes's death, particularly during the Christmas period. Australia captain Michael Clarke was devastated by his friend's death. 

On Christmas Day he took a moment to remember the best friend he called a brother.

'Today you will have Christmas with us bro,' he wrote next to a candle with Phillip's photo sitting on a mantle piece next to a framed picture of his friend with himself and wife Kyly Clarke on a night out.

Clarke is currently injured but was at the MCG on Boxing Day for the start of the third Test against Australia. Before the match he could be seen chatting with his team mates as well as congratulating Joe Burns on making his debut for the side.

The skipper limped off the field on the final day of the first Test in Adelaide against India holding his right hamstring and was forced to miss the rest of the series.

Clarke, 33, had surgery on the hamstring injury last week and had initially feared that his career could be over. But he's not ready to hang up his bat just yet.

In his column for the Daily Telegraph, Clarke wrote: 'The biggest thing for me at the moment is getting back on the field for the World Cup.

'I have been told by medical staff that I am in as good a condition as I can be a week after undergoing the surgery.'

Australia will co-host the World Cup with New Zealand. The tournament begins on 14 February.

Hughes was the 408th person to be selected to wear the famous baggy green cap and Australia’s Test cricketers are all wearing their late teammates numbers on their shirts in the four Tests against India this summer.
