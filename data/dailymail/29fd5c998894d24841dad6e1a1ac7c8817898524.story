Fists were flying at a New York zoo when these two young gorillas starting throwing punches in a fierce fight.

The brothers, who are both blackback western lowland gorillas, punched, nipped and pushed each other around in their enclosure in the Bronx Zoo.

The animals, which can weigh up to 150kg (330lbs) and are the largest of all the primates, also chased each other through the trees as they tried to win the fight.

The images capturing the moment the gorillas clashed were snapped by Dr Michal Samuni-Blank, who has been monitoring them.

But despite the seeming sibling rivalry, the Israeli-born zoologist says the primates rarely hurt each other and are a close family.

Dr Samuni-Blank explained: 'Blackbacks need to practice and develop their fighting skills in order to become successful adults.

'The gorillas were fighting on and off for an hour, biting, punching and pushing each other around.

'Although gorillas are very big and strong, they are mainly vegetarian and will rarely harm other creatures.

'Between fights they sit close to each other in a very friendly fashion.'

Gorillas are the closest living relative to humans after the chimpanzee and display many human-like characteristics

This gorilla decides to sink his teeth into his sibling's arm

Gorillas are the closest living relative to humans after the chimpanzee and the young males share an exhibit at the Bronx Zoo, meaning they are separated from the females, babies and silverbacks.

The zoologist, who now lives in New York, added: 'The gorillas tend to fight in rounds, so once I noticed their chasing pattern, I was able to aim the camera in the best possible direction.

'In my eyes they will always be gentle giants.'

Zoologist, Dr Sumani-Blank says he will always see gorillas as gentle giants despite their fun of fighting
