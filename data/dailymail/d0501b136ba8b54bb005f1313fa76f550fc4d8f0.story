Being a home owner and still living relatively close to your capital city is not something many Australian's consider an option.

But new figures from RP Data have highlighted the cheapest five suburbs to buy a house or unit within 10 kilometres of each Australian city.

In Sydney, Wolli Creek was revealed to be the cheapest suburb to buy a home, with a median value of $710,303, closely followed by Waterloo which has a media house price of $761,054.

Median house and unit prices for each capital city in Australia, up to the week ending August 17

Eastlakes and Darlington were the cheapest Sydney suburbs close to the CBD to purchase a unit in, with median prices of  $452,776 and $453,413 respectively.

Despite these prices still being quite expensive, RP Data's research analyst Cameron Kusher told Daily Mail Australia that out of 146 suburbs within 10 kilometres of Sydney's CBD, only 28 had a median price which fell below a million dollars.

'Those areas all tend to have a lot of industrial presence or commercial areas and are not largely residential suburbs,' Mr Kusher said.

However, he added that despite this drawback, the areas have scope for urban renewal in the future due to their proximity to the city.

Rocklea and Keperra were revealed to be the best suburbs to look for a home in Brisbane, with median house prices of $330,848 and $416,036

Glendalough in Western Australia was revealed as the cheapest suburb to buy a house, with the median price of 
$438,995

Near Adelaide, Dry Creek and Gepps Cross were the cheapest suburbs within 10 kilometres of the CBD, at $255,349 and $313,467 respectively

'Looking at Melbourne and even Perth and Canberra, your still paying a lot to get closer to the city but certainly nowhere near as much as you would in Sydney.'

In Melbourne, the suburbs of Bellfield and Maidstone will see you secure a home for just over half a million dollars while Carlton was to found to be the cheapest suburb to purchase a unit close to the capital city, at less than $300,000.

Rocklea and  Keperra were revealed to be the best suburbs  to look for a home in Brisbane, with median house prices of $330,848 and $416,036.

Clarendon Vale near Hobart, with a median house price of $159,159, was found to be the cheapest suburb near Tasmania's CBD

In Darwin the suburb of Malak has a median house price of $585,478, while Alawa was the cheapest suburb for unit prices at around $366,947

Page was the cheapest subrub in Canberra with a median house price of $445,417

A unit close to Brisbane can also be secured for around $332,317 in Tingalpa or $335,633 in Kedron.

According to Mr Kusher, the heightening of prices closer to the CBD reflect where all the amenities are.

'Inner city suburbs are generally better serviced by both essential and desirable amenities such as schools, medical services, shopping centres, social amenity, roads and public transport infrastructure,' he said.

'People don't want to be sitting in traffic or public transport for hours if they don't have to,' he said.

'The competition and desire to be so close to the city centre is what's pushing those values so high.'
