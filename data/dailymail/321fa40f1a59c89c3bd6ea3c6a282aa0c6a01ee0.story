This takes the expression 'cat's got her tongue' to a whole new level.

Adeline McNeil, 21, a student the University of Florida, filmed herself singing the 2007 hit rap sing Buy U a Drank by T-Pain.

But as she starts reciting the lyrics 'I got money in the bank' with a big smile on her face, a tabby cat decides to put an end to the singing session and launches an attack.

The feisty feline is seen clawing at McNeil's face and opening its mouth wide.

It lets out a big meow at the same time, in an apparent fit of rage.

McNeil manages a surprised yelp as she is forced to stop rapping.

The advertising major filmed the incident as she lay in bed. 

Her catty friend didn't to seem to draw any blood.

McNeil later uploaded footage of the attack to Instagram. Viewers joked that she appeared to be in an 'abusive relationship' with her kitty.
