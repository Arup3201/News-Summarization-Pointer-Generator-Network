While the internet is full of amazing stories, for many, there is still nothing quite like leisurely flicking through crisp sheets of newspaper.

Now one Glasgow-based group has decided to combine the tailored-made service of online sites with the layout and form of traditional broadsheets.

Its new service, PaperLater, allows readers to turn their favourite articles on blogs, websites and journals into their own newspapers of between eight and 24 pages.

PaperLater allows people to compile and print their own newspapers of between eight and 24 pages. It collates any online articles with the finished product being shipped straight to a reader's door in newsprint

The service collates these online articles with the finished product being shipped straight to a reader’s door.

PaperLater was launched by the Newspaper Club early in June, and one of its founders Tom Taylor, said the team have stumbled in to a unique gap in the market.

Mr Taylor claims despite what people say the format is still very much alive. ‘There is a lot of writing that doesn't lend itself to reading on a screen,’ he said.

‘We are trying to appeal to people who haven't bought a newspaper in quite a while, or even people so young they never have.

Readers can upload favourite stories from online news sites found on computers and smartphones to read later in print format

Mr Taylor said despite what people say the format is still very much alive. ‘There is a lot of writing that doesn't lend itself to reading on a screen,’ he said

‘In some ways, [the fact it takes a couple of days to come through], there's a joy to it.

When a reader finds something they would prefer to read in print, they can press the ‘Save for PaperLater’ button in their browser.

This alerts The Newspaper Club which stores the entry. When the reader has enough articles, they can hit print and the service automatically layout, print and ship them a newspaper.

He said there's a limit on what we can do because it has to go through the postal service.

It's not good for delivering news, Mr Taylor added, but is ideal for pieces that are less time dependent, such as features.

‘There is a real mix of everything from interviews to long form pieces,’ he said. ‘I spoke to a doctor who is reading open access medical journals though it.’

Since beta testing in January, the company has gone from 40-50 customers, to printing more than 100 issues a week.

The paper comes with a custom front cover, saying how many words and articles feature throughout.

Currently, the PaperLater service is only available in the UK and costs £4.99 ($8.40) per issue.
