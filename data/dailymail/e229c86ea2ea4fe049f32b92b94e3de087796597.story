John Prescott is to make a surprise comeback to the political frontline, after Ed Miliband called on the bruiser to 'bash heads together'.

Despite Lord Prescott frequently criticising Mr Miliband's party handling, he is to become the Labour leader's special adviser on climate change.

The appointment of Lord Prescott, who once punched a voter on the campaign trail, comes just weeks before the general election amid claims Mr Miliband is at 'logger-Eds' with his shadow chancellor Ed Balls.

The decision to call on Lord Prescott ahead of the general will be seen as an attempt to turn the clock back to when Labour used to win elections.

The move was backed by Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former spin doctor, who also pledged to join the effort to get Mr Miliband elected.

The involvement of senior figures from the last decade contrast with Mr Miliband's repeated claims to have moved on from the New Labour era. 

The Labour leader said that he wanted to exploit Lord Prescott's experience in negotiating the landmark Kyoto Protocol in the run-up to a crucial United Nations summit in Paris at the end of the year.

Writing in The Observer, he said: 'His abilities and experience, as one of the architects of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, must be used at this critical time for our future and there is no one better than John at bashing heads together to get a deal.'

However, it raises the prospect of him playing a high profile role during the election campaign. 

Douglas Alexander, Labour's election co-ordinator, told Sky News: 'I fully expect that as well as that policy role, he will continue to support the Labour campaign in the months ahead and I welcome that.'

However, just months ago Lord Prescott launched a scathing attack on Mr Miliband's 'too timid' approach to winning in May.

Lord Prescott said: 'He might as well have said at the end of his conference speech, 'Go back to your constituencies and prepare for coalition.'

The Labour leadership is in the grip of a crisis, amid claims of deep divisions between Mr Miliband and Mr Balls.

Tensions have mounted over how to pay for Mr Miliband's flagship pledge to cut tuition fees from £9,000 to £6,000.

A meeting last week designed to thrash out how to fund the plan 'did not end well', according to a report in the Sunday Times.

Problems at the top are now so bad that Labour MPs refer to "the Ed aches" or the two leaders being "at logger-Eds".

Mr Miliband is now being urged to ditch Mr Balls from the key economic brief if he wins the election to prevent a repeat of the deeply damaging clashes between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in the last Labour government.

"They don't like each other and they don't respect each other," another insider said.

A new poll for The Observer put the Tories ahead in an Opinium survey for the first time in three years

The latest survey sees David Cameron's party rise two points to 35 per cent, with Labour on 33

Tory hopes of an Election victory were boosted last night as a second opinion poll in under a week put them ahead of Labour.

The survey sees David Cameron's party rise two points to 35 per cent, with Labour on 33. 

Ukip are on 15, the Greens on seven and Lib Dems on six. 

It's the first time in three years that pollsters Opinium have put them ahead of Ed Miliband's party, and follows an ICM survey last week which gave the Tories a four-point lead over Labour.
