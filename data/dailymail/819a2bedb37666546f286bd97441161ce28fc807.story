The German-owned energy giant Npower received the highest number of customer complaints

Customer complaints against German-owned energy giant Npower have soared by 25per cent, confirming it as Britain’s worst supplier.

The company, which imposed the highest price rise this winter, is generating 253.1 complaints per 100,000 customers.

That is around eight times more than the best-performing energy company SSE, where the complaints ratio is just 38.3.

The figures suggest that the company is not only causing real hardship with it high prices, but adding to the woe by failing customers on service.

The company had a particular problem with providing accurate bills on time to customers following the installation of a new computer system.

Npower has been at the centre of a series of controversies in recent months, not least over a decision to raise prices by 10.4per cent before the winter.

It has also announced that hundreds of jobs will be exported to India and thousands of call centre workers are to be transferred to outside third party companies.

The 25per cent rise in complaints was seen during the July to September 2013 period compared to the previous three months.

The figures are compiled by the official customer body, Consumer Focus. Its director of energy services, Audrey Gallacher, described Npower’s performance as ‘very disappointing’.

She said: ‘While Npower has acknowledged and apologised for its poor billing systems and agreed to pay vulnerable customers who have been disadvantaged, its deterioration in performance is still wholly unacceptable and the company must address the failure of its systems, processes and customer service to put things right.

‘Energy companies have repeatedly said they want to rebuild consumer trust.

'Good customer service and complaints handling are key ingredients to achieving this and suppliers still have a long way to go.

'Along with price, good service is important to customers.’

The company apologised for customers' inconveniences and promised 'none' would lose out financially as a result of customer service problems

Citizens Advice Chief Executive Gillian Guy said: ‘Rising energy bills are eating into people’s already stretched budgets, often consuming money that could have been spent on other daily essentials like food.

‘With people paying such a high price to have a warm home or keep the lights on the service provided by energy companies should be exemplary, but all too often we’re finding that’s not the case. 

‘The findings from Consumer Futures should serve as a stark reminder to energy firms that there is much more for them to do in order to improve service and increase consumer trust.’ 

Npower’s Roger Hattam said many of the problems surrounded the installation of a new billing system.

He said: ‘I know that we’ve let many of our domestic customers down and I want to apologise personally for this and promise that they will not lose out financially as a direct result of these issues.

‘We’re working on these issues as top priority and, while we still have a long way to go, we’re making good progress.

'Our customers deserve to get the best service possible and this is my commitment to them.

‘As part of our commitment to be open and honest with our customers, we have added web pages on npower.com so customers can find out more about our system issues.’
