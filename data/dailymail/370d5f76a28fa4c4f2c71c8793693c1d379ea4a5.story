Despite living in the remote mountains of Central Africa, this baby gorilla had no problem showing off his natural talent for entertainment in front of the cameras.

Showing no signs of fearing neither the visitors not the attention, he put on an acrobatic show doing the splits and hanging upside down from the tree branches.

The young mountain gorilla performed just yards from a group of biologists and hikers visiting Virunga National Park in Rwanda – possibly reassured by the presence of his huge 35stone silverback father.

The baby daddy, alpha male Guhonda, is believed to be the oldest and heaviest mountain gorilla in the world.

The
 youngster is the latest addition to Guhonda’s tribe, the Sabinyo, which
 make up part of one of the just two mountain gorilla populations in the
 world.

Despite being under constant threat from poachers, the visitors did not scare the young ape.

Photographer
 Peter Stanley, 39, said: ‘This little male seemed to warm to my 
attention as soon as I lifted the camera and went into a three minute 
acrobatic routine directly in front of me.

‘It
 really felt like he was simply showing off and loved the attention. He 
even gave me a mock dominance display with the classic chest beating 
that you see in the movies.’

This
 baby was the latest addition to the Sabinyo family, led by alpha male 
Guhonda - believed to be the oldest and heaviest mountain gorilla in the
 world.

And it was this powerful ape who greeted Peter, the group and their armed escort, as they entered his territory.

Peter,
 a biology teacher who lives in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, said: ‘There 
was only one moment that got my blood moving and that was when Guhonda 
charged our group, shattering bamboo stalks above our heads with his 
outstretched hand.

‘It was very clear that this was just a friendly warning that we were visitors in his domain.

‘I did not feel in danger, instead I felt a sense of awe for the speed, power and beauty of this phenomenal species.’

After being accepted as visitors the group watched as the family playfully interacted and ate vegetation.

On the rise: Recent efforts has seen the population of the mountain gorilla increase, with 480 individuals now believed to be living in the Virungas

One female even appeared to be getting drunk on alcohol in the fermented bamboo.

Elsewhere,
 there were reminders of the dangers faced by mountain gorillas with one
 handless female seen carrying a baby on her back.

She had a hand amputated after getting it caught in a poacher's trap.

This is just one of reasons mountain gorillas in the Virunga National Park are listed as 'critically endangered'.

Other
 threats include loss of habitat from human encroachment - such as 
deforestation for farms - as well as illegal trade of live animals and 
animal parts as trophies and poaching for meat.

In
 1981, the population was nearing extinction with 280 individuals but 
thanks to efforts of conservationists and governmental support, the 
global population has now reached an estimated 980 with healthy young in
 most family groups.
