Pepsi flavored Cheetos exist.

That’s right, you read correctly. Pepsi-flavored Cheetos are a thing. But they are only on-sale in Japan. Officially named ‘Pepsi Shuwa Shuwa,’ the snacks will not be sold in the US, according to a Frito-Lay spokesperson.

Reactions online have ranged from amusement and disgust to one person professing their love for the strange snack.

Pepsi Shuwa Shuwa: these strange snacks are named after the sound of carbonation

In a country known for having strange food, the cola flavored snacks named after the sound of carbonation are getting mixed reviews.

The nouveau Cheetos actually smell like Pepsi, according to multiple online reviews, and reveal what a naked Cheeto would like if stripped of all its cheese.

If pictures are worth a thousand words, the look on the face of one taste-tester on YouTube was priceless.

‘Oh, that’s so weird,’ the reviewer immediately said with a confused look on his face as he reached back into the bag for a second helping, almost in disbelief of what he was eating.

Not convinced: This reviewer wasn't a fan, calling the snacks strange and weird

Explaining the texture is ‘basically a Cheeto,’ the disappointed snack enthusiast said ‘I’m not gonna say it tastes good.’

Laughing incredulously, he described a carbonation sensation on the tongue similar to Pop-Rocks ‘you can feel the carbonation as you’re eating the corn snacks, it’s really weird.’

Calling the Frito Lay-Pepsi collaboration ‘interesting,’ the reviewer says that soda-flavored Cheetos are considered ‘crazy’ even by most of his colleagues.

The original: It appears most people would rather just stick to plain old Cheetos

Retailing for only a few hundred yen in Japan, the snacks can be bought on eBay for varying prices ranging all the way up to almost $50, as part of an assortment of other weird snacks.

‘Amazing Pepsi flavored Cheetos… they’re yummy,’ tweeted one person, complete with a picture of her new favorite snack.

'I think I just threw up in my mouth,' tweeted another person. 

Despite early reports the snacks might make their way to the US, a Frito –Lay spokesperson immediately shot down the idea.

‘The answer is no,’ the spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times.
