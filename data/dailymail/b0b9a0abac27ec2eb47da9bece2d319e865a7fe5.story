An eyewitness today said a woman screamed 'help me, help me, it's murder' in the moments after she was stabbed with a meat cleaver as a man went on the rampage.

The attacker knifed a 28-year-old woman, named locally as Keisha, to death a few roads away just minutes later and also attacked her 17-year-old sister.

The woman who witnessed the first attack on a 46-year-old mother said she saw the man land repeated blows to the victim's head and shoulder in Streatham, south London.

Attack: Blood is seen around a door frame at the property in Streatham, south London, where a woman was left in a critical condition after being stabbed

Investigation: Police stand guard today outside the flat where a 40-year-old woman was knifed last night as a man started a rampage. A woman was later killed at another address

Probe: A police officer can be seen stood outside the flat where a 46-year-old woman was stabbed. She is currently in a critical condition

The victim, who is 
believed to be the suspect's partner, was rushed to hospital last night 
after apparently being attacked in front of her three-year-old son.

Police said today that she remains in a critical condition.

Just after midnight a 40-year-old
man was arrested on a bus around 1.5 miles away after police boarded it
and carried out a search.

Today the suspect was being held in a south London police station as he was questioned on suspicion of murder.

An eyewitness said she saw the knifeman moments after he carried out the first attack on a 46-year-old woman.

The woman then rushed upstairs to the
flat, to find the victim on the balcony and the couple's son sitting 'zombie-like' watching cartoons on the television.

She said: 'I was in the park with my son when I heard this screaming and shouting coming from the nearby block.

'I looked upstairs to see a man 
hitting this woman. First it thought it was a bat but then I saw the 
shiny bit and realised it was a meat cleaver. He was hitting on the head
and back, just over and over again. There was blood pouring out from 
everywhere.

Attacks: The three women were stabbed at properties close together in Streatham, before the suspect was arrested on a bus nearby later

Horror: Blood is seen outside the property where the woman was stabbed. Police have cordoned the area off while they investigate

'Everyone saw what was happening. 
Kids started screaming. Then he comes running down the stairs, blood all
over his shirt. Blood everywhere.

'He seemed very angry but not like crazed or anything. He ran off towards Brixton Hill.

'I phoned the ambulance and then went
running up to where she lived. I don't know them so I didn't know where
they lived but one of the neighbours told me.

'When I got there the woman was 
slumped on the balcony, passed out. The little girl (police have since confirmed the child was in fact a boy) was just sitting in 
front of the TV zombie-like.Â

'She must have seen the whole thing. 
Him doing that to her mum I said "Are you OK?", but she didn't say 
anything.

'I got the woman inside the flat and 
took the little girl into the kitchen. The police turned up and told me 
to start applying pressure to the wounds.

'She was in a terrible state. Her 
fingers were all bent back like they had been broken, she had loads of 
deep cuts on her head and back.'

'It has traumatised me. Keep thinking
why did I speak to him, he could have done it to me. The whole thing is
surreal. Can't believe it happened.'

Another witness claimed that the woman screamed "help me" as she was being attacked.

She said: 'I was making my dinner when
I heard screaming. All the kids were out playing. I could see them all 
looking up so I walked out on to the Green area and all of sudden the 
kids started screaming and running off.

'I looked up and saw a man, a black 
guy, he had her, she was black as well, by the scruff of the neck. She 
was saying 'please no' and then 'help me, help me, it's murder'

'The next thing I know he stuck the 
knife in her back, right there on the balcony. It was in the top of her 
back near the shoulders. I couldn't see too well but it looked like a 
kitchen knife.

'I just ran back inside. It was 
terrifying. I couldn't believe what I had just seen. I hope I never have
to see something like that ever again.'

Witness Blazej Makowski, 17, said he heard the 46-year-old woman screaming 'where's my baby, where's my baby'.

The teenager said: 'I was upstairs with my brother and his girlfriend when I heard screaming. I thought it was the kids playing at first, but then I realised it was adults screaming.

'I went to go downstairs, but my brother stopped me said "Don't get involved".

'But I thought I have to go down because I could hear the woman. She was screaming "he's going to kill me, he's trying to kill me".

'I went downstairs. He was gone, the man was gone, but the woman was there.

'She was outside on the balcony, she couldn't get in so I unlocked the balcony and got her inside. Me and this other girl.

'The woman was crying "where's my baby, where's my baby". I think she was talking about her son, who was just sitting there. He wasn't saying anything.'

Detectives said they are not seeking 
anyone else in connection with this investigation, and it is believed 
that all three victims were known to him.

The local MP Chuka Umunna said: 'The entire community will be deeply disturbed and upset at what happened on the Roupell Park and Clapham Park estates last night.

'The thoughts of all of us are with the loved ones of the woman who was fatally injured and the other victims of these horrific attacks.

'I have been fully briefed by the police on this incident and an investigation is currently ongoing. Our hope is that the perpetrator of these acts will be brought to justice. As a community, we will give the loved ones of the victims all the support that we can.'

Murder probe: The block of flats where a woman was killed and a 17-year-old girl was left with serious injuries after a double stabbing

Arrest: The suspected, aged 40, was held after police boarded a bus on Leigham Court Road, near Streatham, around 1.5 miles from the scene of the killing

Detective
Inspector Will Reynolds, from the Met's Homicide and Serious Crime 
Command, said: 'I can confirm the suspect was at large for up to five hours in and around the Lambeth area.

'It was a difficult circumstance as details of the suspects whereabouts continued to change.'

When asked why it took so long to apprehend the suspect, he said: 'It is very early in the investigation so I can't say.

'What I can say is that a huge 
manhunt was undertaken, with specialist teams brought in with expressed 
intention of finding this person. Huge resources were used and every 
attempt was made to apprehend him as quickly as possible.

'I would also like to thank the local
community who played a vital role in this persons arrest. In fact it 
was a member of the public who notified us of the whereabouts of this 
person, who we were then able to arrest.'

Speaking outside Brixton Police Station this afternoon, he also confirmed that very young children had witnessed both attacks.

He said: 'There were children present at both scenes. This was a series of extremely brutal attacks.

'This would have been very 
traumatising for these you children. They are currently being looked 
after and will wait until later in the investigation to see if it is 
necessary to speak to them about what they saw.'
