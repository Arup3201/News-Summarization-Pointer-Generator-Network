It took Graham Hughes nearly four years to cover 201 nations to become the first person to travel the world without flying.

Now fans can undertake the same journey in only four minutes without needing to leave the house.

The 33-year-old from Liverpool used
 buses, taxis, trains and his own two feet to travel 160,000 miles in 
1,426 days - all on a shoestring budget of just $100 (£65) a week.

Graham Hughes' madcap trip around the world has been edited into four short minutes - starting with Brazil

His mission began in South America, taking in Guyana along the way

Hughes' job of editing the footage was made a little easier by the fact that he remembered to film himself saying where he was - seen here on the Caribbean leg in Antigua

Hughes filmed his travels for a documentary after setting off from his hometown on New Year's Day 2009.

By December last year, he crossed the border into the newly-created South Sudan and cracked open the champagne to celebrate completing his mission.

Now he's edited days of footage into a whirlwind tour of the globe, taking in one nation every second.

Handily, Hughes filmed himself announcing where he was for his tour diaries, making his task of including every stop a little easier - even if he did forget Malta on his first attempt.

A whistlestop visit to Guinea-Bissau happened on his way from The Gambia to Senegal, where he made it through four African countries in noe day

The Liverpudlian adventurer filmed himself in front of the sign marking the Zimbabwean border

The 1,426-day journey started in Uruguay and ended with its 201st nation, South Sudan

The video sees him posing in the sunshine of South America and the Caribbean, wrapped up warm in Canada, and even pretending to be under arrest by locals in the South Pacific island of Vanuatu.

In almost every shot he wears his trusty fedora hat, while his beard ranges from neatly trimmed, to bushy and even a handlebar moustache for his visit to Papua New Guinea.

Without planes, some of the nations were harder to reach than others - but not the ones you might expect.

Hughes, who has raised nearly £9,000 for WaterAid so far, said it was easier to get into North Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan than it was to reach remote islands such as Nauru in the South Pacific, the Maldives and the Seychelles.

Despite going off the typical backpacker's trail for much of his trip, Hughes still found time to fit in a wonder of the world by visiting the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt

In Bangladesh, Hughes proved he was really there by holding up local currency

Hughes also filmed some of the people he met on his travels, including this woman in the Philippines

It took seven attempts to get into the Seychelles because of the threat from Somali pirates.

He mainly crossed the seas by hitching lifts with cargo ships but struck lucky on the way to the Dominican Republic when a cruise ship let him come aboard.

Hughes spent four days 'crossing open ocean in a leaky boat' to reach Cape Verde from Senegal without any means of communications.

He was jailed for a week in the Congo for being a 'spy', was arrested trying to 'sneak into' Russia and had to be 'rescued from Muslim fundamentalists by a Filipino ladyboy called Jenn'. 

For his visit to Papua New Guinea, Hughes showed off an impressive handlebar moustache

Hughes also shows himself receiving a warm welcome in the Pacific island nation Vanuatu

The end! South Sudan didn't exist as a country when Graham Hughes set off in January 2009, but he crossed its border in December last year and toasted the end of his challenge

His favourite place was Palau, an island state in the Western Pacific.

Other highlights included dancing with the Highlanders of Papua New Guinea, befriending orangutans in Borneo, riding through the badlands of Kenya on an 18-wheel truck, meeting the Prime Minister of Tuvalu - and 'warning schoolchildren in Afghanistan about the dangers of men with beards'.

Graham Hughes visited 201 nations, including the 193 members of the United Nations, Taiwan, Vatican City, Palestine, Kosovo, Western Sahara and the four home nations of the United Kingdom.

Territories are marked with a 'T' before the number.

The countries are listed in the order they appear in the video, not in the order he visited.
