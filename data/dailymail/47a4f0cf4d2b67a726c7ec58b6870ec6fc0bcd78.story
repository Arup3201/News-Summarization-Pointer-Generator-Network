Day release: Michael Wheatley, who is charged with being unlawfully at large, was on temporary release when he fled an open prison

More than 1,600 murderers, druglords and other hardened criminals were granted day release last year.

They joined 518,000 other convicts who were handed freedom passes in 2012-13 - almost double the rate 10 years ago.

But 431 failed to return, and seven are still at large.

The shocking figures reported in The Sun have emerged after 'Skull Cracker' Michael Wheatley fled an open jail last week while serving 13 life sentences.

Last July, Ian McLoughlin, 55, was convicted of murdering Graham Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day release.

Murderer Joseph Williams, 52, carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010.

And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a Â£14million cocaine deal.

Parole officers insist the system is a necessary part of rehabilitation.

A temporary licence is designed to help prisoners settle back into the community towards the end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training.

Some can be granted a pass to visit a dying family member or seek medical treatment.

However, campaigners and politicians last night blasted the restraints as 'uncontrolled', allowing convicts to escape.

Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan has written to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling calling for tighter restrictions and demanding an explanation as to why Michael Wheatley was granted release.

He told The Sun: 'Prisoners mustn't be let out willy-nilly, but only for hood reasons after suitable checks.'

Michael Wheatley will appear at Guildford Crown Court on May 29 charged with robbery, possession of a firearm or imitation firearm, and being unlawfully at large.
