It’s more James Bond than Philippe Starck - a UK-based firm has spent millions creating the house of the future using space-age technology that would be more at home in Q Division, the research and development arm of the secret service, than Ikea.

The so-called Cornflake house - named after the company that installed the devices - includes a secret wall and floor that rotates to reveal a hidden two meter television screen and a virtual security guard complete with Alsatian ‘patrolling’ various rooms by projector.

There’s also a £10,000 hot drinks maker operated remotely by an iPad that shoots beverages into vacant cups, magnetic wallpaper, a cinema and other high-tech gadgety that cost a total of £750,000.

The lounge of the Cornflake house in Tottenham Court Road, London, pictured, features a projector and lighting that adjusts to what colours are on the screen. The lights will also pulsate in time with music. UK tech firm Cornflake decked out the property, dubbed The House of the Future, with high-tech gadgets costing £750,000

The Thunderbirds-style bar in the Cornflake house, pictured, converts into a lounge at touch of a button with the floor and wall rotating to reveal a hidden TV. The walls and floor are controlled through an iPad and can turn a sitting room into a home cinema into a games room and more

And forget ever running out of Martinis.

The drinks glasses in this house are fitted with electronic chips that send messages to whoever is manning the bar that a drink needs to be replenished.

Privately owned technology firm Cornflake has teamed up with a range of high-tech manufacturers to fit out its house off London’s Tottenham Court Road with gadgets costing a collective £750,000 that most have never even dreamt of let alone can afford.

A showcase of high-end devices for the rich and famous, the house is spread over two levels and comes complete with movie room containing a cinema-grade screen.

Forget ordering your TV in inches you know you have made it when you’re ordering in meters - Cornflake’s App-artment features a 4m widescreen television with state of the art sound system.

The Cornflake bar room also has a 'flat frog' screen, shown in the foreground, which is a very high-end multitouch table that four or five people, such as a whole family, can use at the same time. It can recognise and distinguish each separate pair of hands. Images from the table can be beamed to the projector, shown in the background

When the flat frog screen isn't being used as a touchscreen device or beaming images, it can be used with specially-created beer glasses, pictured, that have chips built into the bottom. These chips connect to the screen, which can then tell when the glass needs to be refilled

A £10,000 tap that is controlled by an iPad makes lattes at a touch of a button. It is the world's first i-coffee machine, designed originally for super-yachts, and makes hot drinks within 45 seconds. The machine can also remember how you take certain drinks. It also makes fresh orange juice, chilled water and boiling water for cooking

The light, vision, sound and heat are controlled by an iPad that fits snuggly into the world’s first motorised in-wall dock, so it is never misplaced again.

And as for drawing the curtains at sunset, Lutron’s automated shades are activated based on an outside sensor that can tell when it’s getting dark.

It also shuts the curtains automatically when a movie is selected and the lights are turned down.

Security being a high priority, the system mimics your habits when you are on holiday opening and closing curtains and activating lights to deter burglars.

The house is spread over two levels and because there are no windows in the basement, an LED Growlight, pictured, hidden beneath wall units keeps plants and herbs alive while a watering system can be operated remotely while on holiday. Cornflake sells the various gadgets separately or as part of a package

Director of Cornflake Gary Lewis, pictured, controls the 4-metre projector in the cinema room from his iPad. The cinema room has a state-of-the art sound system built into the walls, which themselves are covered in magnetic wallpaper. Numerous smaller TVs, including a 2-metre one in the lounge, are built into walls or furniture

Operated by iPad, it is linked to various beverages in a chilled area and only a designer spout is visible.

At the touch of a button it provides tea, hot chocolate, fresh orange juice, chilled water and boiling water for cooking.

The firm, which counts a number of Middle Eastern billionaires and celebrities as clients, sells the various gadgets separately or as part of a package to transform people’s homes.

A recent survey showed London’s property boom has been fuelled by foreign millionaires.

Only around 45 per cent of buyers in central London are UK nationals with many purchasing second and third homes.

At upmarket One Hyde Park, only 17 of the 76 apartments sold were registered as primary residences and in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea average prices are over £1million.

Many buyers hire technology firms to install the latest kit in their homes prior to moving in. At the Cornflake house the kitchen is state of the art.

It features a De Dietrich’s piano hob – understood to be the world’s most advanced induction hob.

It solves the age old problem of when a pan boils over and runs dry – the smart technology turns the heat off.

Also as you move the pan across the surface, the heat follows it, allowing you to cook anywhere on the hob making space for more receptacles.

An extractor fan also emerges from the counter top rising vertically and then extending horizontally whirred into life.

There’s a self-cook and self-clean oven that can tell when a meal is ready by sending you a message and then turning itself off.

The worktops have the appearance and toughness of granite, but they are made from recycled paper and cost from £250 per square metre.

And as there are no windows in the basement an LED Growlight hidden beneath wall units keeps plants and herbs alive while a watering system can be operated remotely while on holiday.

Director Gary Lewis said his customers have yet to feel the strain from the worsening economic climate.

‘We haven’t been affected that much,’ he said. ‘There is a lot of Chinese and Russian money about and you only need to drive through London to see the amount of scaffolding around houses. It’s these homes that tend to want new technology in some form or other.’

At £750,000 a pop – its unlikely to catch on around the country.
