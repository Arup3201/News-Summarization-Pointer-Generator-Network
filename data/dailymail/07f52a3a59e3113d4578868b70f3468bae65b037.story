This is the horrifying moment a wealthy legal highs seller wheeled a drugged 22-year-old to a hotel room to rape her.

Lloyd Phillips had told the woman he would take her to a pop concert at Wembley Stadium.

Instead, he plied her with a cocktail of drugs and alcohol, leaving her barely conscious.

Moment the abuse began: Lloyd Phillips, 48, drugged the 22-year-old and put her into a wheelchair before raping her at a hotel near Wembley Stadium - he is now beginning an 11-year jail term

The married 48-year-old then took her to a hotel, telling staff he needed a wheelchair for his ‘drunk and disabled girlfriend’.

CCTV
 images show him pushing his helpless victim through the building. Once 
inside the hotel room, he raped her for nine hours – leaving her with 
horrific injuries.

Phillips,
 who made £10,000 a week selling legal highs, drug paraphernalia and 
event tickets at his shop, Lucid, in Southampton, was jailed for 11 
years.

Depraved attack: Phillips, from Southampton, had told his victim they were going to a concert

Police described
 him as a ‘sexual predator’ who tried to impress women by ‘flashing 
cash’ and bragging of his luxury Sunseeker yacht.

And
 they fear it is ‘highly likely’ he attacked many others in a similar 
manner, luring them with the promise of concert tickets.

After his sentencing, his victim said: ‘He is a vile human being. I hope he dies in prison so he cannot hurt anyone else.’

A
 court heard how Phillips, who lived in a luxury £250,000 Southampton 
apartment with his wife, had picked the young woman up from her home in 
the city to travel to a concert given by The Saturdays band.

Once in the car he gave her a capsule and a can of ‘Crunk juce’ – an American, high-alcohol energy drink – to wash it down.

The capsule was later found to be the class C substance BZP, a stimulant that can trigger epileptic seizures and fits.

The drugs left the woman with little memory of the car journey to the hotel near Wembley Stadium.

They caused her to suffer seizures and she had no sense of her surroundings as Phillips pulled up at the hotel.

The CCTV footage shows Phillips wheeling her towards a lift and then to the room where he carried out the nine-hour assault.

Many
 of the details of what he did to her while she was incapacitated – and 
the injuries she suffered – are too horrific to report.

Phillips told staff at the hotel that his 'girlfriend' was drunk and disabled before he borrowed a wheelchair

Aside
 from a brief memory of a clock that read ‘3.48’ and a feeling that she 
was ‘contorted’ the woman, who had regarded Phillips as a friend, had no
 memory of what happened, Harrow Crown Court heard.

She woke confused, with Phillips telling her they had engaged in a night of consensual sex, the jury was told.

On the way home, he told her he was glad she did not ‘feel weird’ about it, adding that some girls ‘might cry rape’.

Speaking after the case, she said: ‘I started to come round the following morning and had no idea what had happened.’

She recalled how she felt ‘sick and confused’ as she sat in the passenger seat of his car on the way home.

Later she went to hospital where doctors called police.

‘I just felt like it was my fault, that I was stupid to have let myself get into that situation. I blamed myself,’ she said.

Phillips was convicted of two counts of rape and four sexual assault charges.

His
 victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, collapsed in court while
 giving her evidence and still suffers from nightmares

She said: ‘I would urge anyone in my situation to be brave, come forward and speak out.’

Superintendent Stuart Murray said the crime was a ‘cruel and cynical abuse’ of the victim’s trust.

He
 added: ‘[Phillips] used his shop and concert ticket business to 
befriend young people, often at vulnerable times in their lives … The 
level of planning involved, his behaviour towards his victim and his 
casual demeanour afterwards lead us to believe he has done this before.’

Jailed: Phillips is now serving 11 years, while his Southampton 'head' shop is under new management

The shop owned by rapist Lloyd Phillips was one of hundreds of similar outlets which have sprung up on high streets in recent years.

And there are around 690 online sellers of legal high drugs based in in Britain.

They package the drugs as research chemicals, plant food or bath salts – and label them as ‘not for human consumption’ – leaving councils and the police powerless to stop them selling the often harmful substances.

When Phillips was questioned by local press in 2010 about the potentially lethal drugs he said: ‘Do I feel bad about selling legal products to adults?

‘No, no more than I would selling cream cakes or pies to a fat person, selling alcohol to an alcoholic, selling cigs to someone with cancer.’
