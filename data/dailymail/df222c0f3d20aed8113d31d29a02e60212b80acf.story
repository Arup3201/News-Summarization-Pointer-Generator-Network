A mother-of-three has revealed how she created the illusion of having a perfect family life when she and her husband were in fact addicted to heroin.

The former drug user, who only wanted to be identified as Marie, shared her story on today's This Morning.

Her experience echoes that of Peaches Geldof, whose death from an overdose recently shocked the nation. The star, 25, gave the impression of being the perfect wife and mother-of-two via her social media posts and public appearances. But her recent inquest revealed she was secretly taking heroin. 

Heroin-addicted mother: Marie shared her story on today's This Morning

Shock overdose: Like the late Peaches Geldof, Marie appeared to be the perfect mother but took drugs behind closed doors

Like Peaches, Marie told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford how she kept her addiction secret while successfully fulfilling her roles as a doting mother and reliable employee.

Her children, neighbours and other mothers she met on the school run had no idea about her life behind closed doors.

She said: I was like a chameleon, I would blend in wherever I was...  it was like two totally different worlds.'

Marie confessed that during the day, she was the perfect mother and was a complete professional in her job as a therapist.

But after the children had gone to school or bed, she and her husband, Francis, would take heroin.

'Nobody knew. We over compensated on how we looked,' she explained of their public image.

They soon both became addicts and as their wages weren't enough to cover the cost of their habit, Marie started shop lifting.

Likening herself to a modern-day Robin Hood, Marie said she said she felt like it was her 'purpose' to shop lift from stores including Tesco and Marks and Spencers and give many of the goods away.

She admits shop lifting also became an addiction and as the amounts she stole eventually exceeded what she needed to buy heroin, she would then shower her ill-gotten goods on friends and family.

They thought she was a successful and generous career woman sharing her wealth and had no idea their gifts had actually been stolen.

Another addiction: The mother-of-three told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford how she started shoplifting to fund her drug habit

Recalling how her drug use began, Marie - also like Peaches - had a childhood marred by tragedy.

When she was seven, her younger sister died in a terrible accident.

Marie said that the loss of her sibling was 'without a doubt' the trigger for her drug use.

'Nothing made sense after that and I really struggled at school,' she explained. She first started taking drugs at the age of 13 and by the age of 17, she was admitted to rehab.

Unable to break her habit, she began her prolific shop lifting to fund it - which eventually led to her being imprisoned and then being put on another rehabilitation programme.

Kicked the habit: Martie realised she had to stop taking drugs for the sake of her children

It was there that she met her husband and the couple embarked on a clean life together, getting married and having three children.

But when their lives were touched by tragedy again, they turned back to drugs to cope.

'Francis's mum passed away and my mum passed way and there were a few other bereavements in family,' Marie said. 'I don't want to glorify heroin but it gives you a "Ready Break" feeling - a warm glow, it took the pain away.'

She added: 'We thought it would be a one-off but were quickly both addicted again.'

Marie admits that her facade as a perfect mother eventually began to crack and she 'lost the plot and started self harming'.

As Francis returned to rehab, she realised she had to support him and change her own life for the sake of her family.

'I thought I have these three amazing children - why do I I keep doing the same behaviours?' she said.

She gave up the drugs and 'weaned' herself off shop lifting and has now been clean for seven years.
