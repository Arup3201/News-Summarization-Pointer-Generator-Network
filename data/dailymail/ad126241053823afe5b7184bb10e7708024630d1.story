Whoever thought up the phrase doggy paddle has obviously never met Morph, an cat who is more than happy to take a dip in the pool.

Swimming helps relieve the 14-year-old feline's arthritis, stimulating blood flow, easing pain on the joints, and helping to build strength.

According to staff, Morph was less-than-happy about taking the plunge at first, but he is now confident enough to swim laps of the pool at South Coast Hydrotherapy School in Wimborne, Dorset.

Morph, a 14-year-old cat, has been taking hydrotherapy lessons to help with his arthritis

Morph was reluctant to take the plunge for the first time, but is so confident he now swims laps

While the centre caters for dogs, who are more accustomed to swimming, the treatment with Morph has been so successful that they now plan on rolling it out to cats as well.

Jo Scott, principal at South Coast Hydrotherapy School, based at Verwood Hydrotherapy Centre, said: 'The treatment is usually reserved for dogs.

'It is the hydrostatic pressure that helps. It is an all over pressure, helps to ease the joints, mobility, blood flow and circulation while reducing swelling.

'It is a non-weight bearing exercise which is good for building muscles, fitness, weight control and fun.'

The centre usually offers its services to dogs, but is now considering allow more cats to come

The South Coast Hydrotherapy School also offers people classes in hydrotherapy treatment for animals

Vaughn Stoman, director of the centre, said: 'It is our philosophy that we are not just happy to treat disease, but we want to see our companions contributing to a more fulfilled and meaning full life.

'That is why we offer clinical treatment as well as the fun stuff like agility, obedience training, hydrotherapy, under water treadmill and puppy classes.

'Here you are not just a clinical case, we like to build a relationship with you and your pet, one you can trust.'

The centre is not the only place to offer swimming classes for dogs.

As well as treating medical conditions the sessions can also help obese animals work out and lose weight

Vaughn Stoman, director of the centre, said: 'It is our philosophy that we are not just happy to treat disease, but we want to see our companions contributing to a more fulfilled and meaningful life'

In the US, the Happy Tails resort in Virginia offers swimming classes for canines, giving them two ramps and a pool to play on with several pets at a time having a go.

The pool is part of a 12,000ft luxury care centre with custom made beds, recessed lighting and piped in music for the pets.

It also features the indoor pool, which has two ladders for the dogs to get in and out and is surrounded by decking so they can have a lie down when they get tired.
