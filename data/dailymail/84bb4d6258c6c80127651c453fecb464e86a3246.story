Timothy Jarvis, 18, was just days into starting a maths degree at the University of Essex when the tragic accident occurred

A mother condemned the ‘dangerous culture’ of freshers’ week binge-drinking yesterday after her student son died in a drunken fall.

Timothy Jarvis, 18, was in the first week of his maths degree when he downed an entire bottle of rum in 15 minutes for a bet.

The former grammar school boy then suffered fatal head injuries after tumbling down a flight of stairs at his university’s hall of residence.

Despite being taken to hospital, it was 90 minutes before he was assessed by a doctor and he died the next day.

His grieving mother Marina, 54, said: ‘I don’t see the point of freshers’ week at all and I think it should be banned.

‘They think they are adults, but they are not – they have left the nest but they are still children.

‘They are there to study, not drink, and this tradition of cheap drinks and getting drunk is a very dangerous culture.

‘Suddenly this antisocial binge-drinking is only acceptable because it’s happening at university where the young intelligentsia are.

‘It is truly tragic what happened to our son, but this could happen to all parents with children at university.’

Mr Jarvis, from Orpington, Kent, won a place at Essex University last year after achieving four good A levels at St Olave’s Grammar School.

His inquest heard the popular musician had made a bet with friends on his corridor that he could drink a bottle of rum in half an hour.

Fellow student Dimitris Vachaviolos, 19, said: ‘Tim was drinking a bottle of rum and my friend had a stopwatch going. It was just a game.

‘He had a bet that he could drink a bottle of rum in 30 minutes. He did it. He drunk it in 15 minutes, actually.’ 

Mr Vachaviolos said he helped Mr Jarvis downstairs and out of the hall of residence, where he was sick, before he tried to help him up to bed.

‘As we tried to get him into bed he turned and started chasing me and a couple of girls,’ he said.

‘Again, it was just a game, there was nothing malicious about it.

‘My room was at the end of the corridor, with a stairwell next to it.

'I closed my door and expected him to follow me in, but he didn’t come to my door, he went straight into the stairwell.

‘I heard what I can only describe as a tumble or fall.’

He found Mr Jarvis unconscious at the bottom of the stairs with a large swelling near his eye.

When paramedics arrived and found Mr Jarvis unconscious, they made a ‘red alert’ call to Colchester Hospital to warn them to expect a serious case.

But when they arrived at 12.35am, 
there was no trauma team to meet them, Mr Jarvis was left on a trolley 
in a corridor and was not assessed by a doctor for nearly 90 minutes.

NHS guidelines say every patient should be examined by a nurse within 15
 minutes and by a doctor within an hour.

Eventually at 2am, a junior doctor noticed the teenager was ‘very unwell’.

CT scans revealed severe bleeding on 
the brain and he was transferred to the neurosurgery department at 
Queen’s Hospital, Romford, where he underwent emergency surgery at 5am.

He died the next day.

Death: University of Essex halls of residence in Colchester. The former grammar school boy suffered 
massive head injuries after drunkenly stumbling down a flight of stairs 
following a night of heavy drinking

Although Walthamstow coroner, Chinyere Inyama, recorded a verdict of accidental death, he was highly critical of the hospital.

‘A public authority needs to have systems in place to prevent such a death, any death,’ he said.

‘The word tragedy is used a lot but I can’t think of a more appropriate word in this case – it was a true tragedy.’

Verdict: accidental death.
