The wife of Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling says that they have been estranged for the past year and has debated formally filing the divorce papers.

'I don't love him. I pity him and I feel sorry for him,' Shelly Sterling said in an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters that will air in full Monday evening.

The timeline of their relationship remains murky, because while the 79-year-old said that she and her 81-year-old husband have only been estranged for a year, she has been thinking about divorce for much longer.

Shocked: Shelley Sterling says she could not believe what she was hearing the first time she listened to the recordings

'For the last 20 years, I've been seeing attorneys for a divorce,' she said during the Walters interview.

'In fact, I have here- I just filed- I was going to file the petition. I signed the petition for a divorce. And it came to almost being filed. And then, my financial advisor and my attorney said to me, "Not now."'

She went on to say that the formal act of divorce has a lot to do with 'financial arrangements' but added that 'eventually, I'm going to do it'.

Donald Sterling's net worth is estimated to be somewhere around $1.9billion and he bought the LA Clippers in 1981 but now Shelly legally owns half of the team.

'I've been with the team for 33 years, through the good times and the bad times. And it's my passion and I love it,' she said.

One legal action that Shelly has launched into is a formal suit against V. Stiviano, her husband's alleged mistress who is the other voice on the now-infamous racist recording.

Mrs Sterling said that Stiviano had been given three luxury cars- a Ferrari and two Bentleys- as well as other gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Shelly is fighting for half of those gifts.

In spite of their troubled 60-year marriage, Shelly Sterling maintains that she does not believe Donald is racist.

'I - in my opinion, I think he - it's the onset of dementia,'  she said during a Sunday interview with ABC News.

'I don't remember saying that. I don't remember ever saying those things,' she recalled him saying after hearing the now-infamous tapes.

'I said, 'Well, this is the tape.' And
 he says, 'Hmm. I don't remember it,' she told Barbara Walters. 'That's 
when I thought he had dementia.

The interview came almost two weeks 
after NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced he had banned Donald 
Sterling from the league for life after recordings of his racist ranting
 at presumed mistress V Stiviano were made public.

Silver
 urged owners to move quickly to force Donald Sterling to sell the team,
 and the league has since even installed a former Time Warner 
executive to oversee the team's operations - but it was soon revealed 
that Shelley Sterling legally owns half of the team.

And she has repeatedly said she will 
fight to retain her stake, adding an unwanted twist to the NBA's plan to
 force new ownership on the franchise.

'I will fight that decision,' she said, adding the team is her 'passion,' and 'a legacy to my family.

'I've been with the team for 33 years, through the good times and the bad times,' said Shelly Sterling.

Shelly Sterling also asked if there had even been an instance where an owner was forced to sell his stake in a sports franchise after his wife had spoken inappropriately.

She then suggested she 'would love him to' transfer his ownership stake in the team to her, but said she hadn't yet broached the possibility with him or his attorneys.

Her steadfast refusal to part with her
 stake in the Clippers was first reported earlier this week when her 
attorney Pierce O'Donnell, said his client 'will not agree to a forced 
or involuntary seizure of her interest.

'As her lawyers, we will fight vigorously to defend her property rights,' he said.

O'Donnell said Mrs. Sterling has no 
interest in managing the Clippers and wants a new investor group to come
 in with a professional management team.

O'Donnell
 also said that Shelly Sterling has been separated from her husband for 
the last year and is considering divorce. There is no record of legal 
separation documents being filed, though O'Donnell said the couple is 
living apart.

Last month, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Donald Sterling from the NBA for life and urged league owners to force him to sell the team. The move came after a recording surfaced in which Sterling made racist comments, telling friend V. Stiviano that he didn't want her to bring black people to Clippers games.

At a news conference announcing the bann, Silver said no decision had been made regarding whether she or any other Sterling family member will be allowed to retain an ownership position.

O'Donnell said he spoke with NBA officials Thursday morning but declined to elaborate. He said his client has been working cooperatively with Silver and his staff and supported his announcement seeking a new chief executive officer for the team and the NBA's decision to place longtime team President Andy Roeser on leave.

NBA spokesman Mike Bass said the league wouldn't comment on its discussions.

O'Donnell said Shelly Sterling 'abhors' her husband's comments and that 'the Sterlings may share the same last name, but she does not share his values on race.' The Sterlings have been married 57 years, O'Donnell said.

'We abhor guilt by association in America,' O'Donnell said. 'The sins of the husband cannot be imputed to the wife or children.'

Shelly and Donald Sterling faced allegations that they discriminated against tenants based on race in Los Angeles according to a lawsuit filed by U.S. Department of Justice in 2006. The Sterlings, who at the time owned and managed about 119 apartment buildings or 5,000 apartments throughout Los Angeles County, agreed to settle the suit for $2.725 million.

The settlement also included two suits filed by former tenants at one of the properties, including an African-American family and an interracial married couple with biracial children, who alleged the Sterlings demolished their private yards among other actions because of their race, according to the Justice Department.

'The charges against her by former tenants are false, unfounded and were never ever determined to be valid in a court of law,' O'Donnell said. He said the case was settled without any admission of liability. 'She doesn't have a racist bone in her body,' O'Donnell said.

Clippers coach Doc Rivers said Thursday at the team's training facility that 'it would be a very hard situation' if Mrs. Sterling retained her portion of ownership in the team.

'I guarantee you every person wouldn't be on board with that,' Rivers said. 'Whether I would or not, I'm not going to say.'
