Kevin Pietersen has been in talks with Surrey ‘for several weeks’ about a possible return to county cricket after approaching senior figures at the ECB about a shock international comeback before new chairman Colin Graves was appointed.

The 34-year-old batsman’s hopes of an England return are gaining momentum, with Surrey seriously interested in re-signing the maverick star provided he is released from his Indian Premier League contract.

Sportsmail understands Pietersen, currently exiled from the England squad after being sacked by team managing director Paul Downton, has been talking to Surrey’s director of cricket Alec Stewart, who is known to be open to him re-signing if he becomes available for all three formats - and not just Twenty20 cricket as he has been in the past.

It emerged on Saturday that Pietersen’s IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad are unlikely to object to releasing the star, leaving the unlikely prospect of Pietersen forgoing the IPL to play in the County Championship second division this summer in a bid to resurrect his England career.

With incoming chairman Graves showing an appetite for significant regime change at the ECB, he has told Pietersen he will be considered for England selection again if he scores heavily in county cricket.

It is understood Pietersen  first made contact with the ECB before Graves appointment was announced last month.

‘There will be a change of scenery at board level with the ECB and I’ve always expressed my desire to play for England again if I get the opportunity,’ Pietersen told Fox News on Saturday.

‘It seems encouraging but I’ve obviously got a few steps that I’ve got to climb. It just makes perfect sense to explore different things, that’s what I’m doing. I’ve still got more decisions to make - it’s the weekend now so nobody will be picking up their phones, but Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday it’ll be very exciting hopefully.’

Downton’s decision to sack Pietersen following last winter’s crushing 5-0 Ashes whitewash was welcomed by senior players in the dressing room who were further angered by the star’s autobiography.

The relative paucity of Pietersen’s current IPL deal - which at £205,000 is worth barely 20 per cent of any of his previous deals - is understood to be a factor in his willingness to return to the grind of county cricket.

At the centre of his attempt to return is the imminent departure of ECB chairman Giles Clarke, who clashed repeatedly with Pietersen following his requests for special treatment over his release for IPL duty.

England’s players would resist Pietersen’s return but their position has been weakened by their dire form since he was sacked. ‘They’d just have to suck it up if he does come back,’ said one insider on Saturday.

If Pietersen - who has a debilitating knee condition - does re-sign for Surrey he would have just three County Championship games to prove himself ahead of England’s first Test of the summer against New Zealand at Lord’s on May 21 before the Ashes later in the summer.

England name their squad for the Test tour of West Indies on Wednesday, with injury doubts hanging over Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, while Jonathan Trott is in line for a recall.
