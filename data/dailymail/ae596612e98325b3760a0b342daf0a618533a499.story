Cancer deaths are soaring in parts of the UK with the highest obesity levels, new figures have revealed.

In pockets of the country where vast swathes of the population are overweight, rates of the disease are rocketing.

It comes as it emerged the mounting obesity crisis is costing the UK economy a staggering £47 billion each year - the same as smoking and war and terrorism.

Campaigners warned today if drastic action is not taken to stem the rising tide of obese and overweight people, cancer will continue to claim more and more lives.

Cancer deaths are soaring in parts of the UK with the highest obesity rates. Copeland in Cumbria recorded the largest increase in death rates linked to the disease over a 10-year period, rising 30 per cent. Three quarters of the population in the Cumbrian borough are overweight or obese - a UK high

For both men and women the first and second most common forms of cancer leading to death were cancers of the digestive organs,  the respiratory and intrathoracic organs. For women the fourth most common form was breast cancer, pictured under the microscope, while for men it was testicular, prostate and penile

Obesity is measured using the body mass index (BMI) score which is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.

Anything under 25 is fine. BMI of 25 to 29.9 is classified as overweight and clinical obesity is defined as 30 or greater. 

New figures published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, found cancer continues to kill more people under the age of 75 than any other disease.

For every 100,000 people in England aged 74 and younger, 142 died from cancer in 2013, compared to 166 in 2003. 

Of the 326 local authority areas included in the report, the death rate from cancer among the under-75s fell in 298 areas, and rose in 246.

The largest increase in cancer death rates was in Copeland, Cumbria, where three quarters of the population are obese or overweight - a UK high. 

There the death rate rose by 30 per cent in a decade, from 149.3 to 193.3 per 100,000 residents from 2003 to 2013. 

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told the Sun: 'This is a real wake-up call and proof that being fat can kill.

'Bad diet and being overweight means you are more likely to die of many cancers.'

People living in Salford face the greatest risk of dying from cancer, with death rates at 201 per 100,000 of the population.

Blackpool and Manchester rank second and third with rates at 196.

Gosport - where 72.9 per cent of the population are obese - came fourth with 195.

Meanwhile, those people living in Hart (95), West Oxfordshire (95), Spelthorne (96) and North Dorset (97) faced the lowest risk. 

• 6,451 women under 75 died from cancers of the digestive organs in 2013, a 10.2 per cent rise from 5,856 in 2003

• 6,497 women under 75 died from cancers of respiratory and intrathoracic organs in 2013, an increase of 15.7 per cent on 5,617 in 2003

• 5,810 women under 75 died from breast cancer in 2013, a 13.3 per cent fall from 5,037 in 2003 

• 10,948 men under 75 died from cancers of the digestive organs in 2013, an increase of 3.0 per cent from the 10,630 deaths in 2003

• 8,677 men under 75 died from cancers of respiratory and intrathoracic organs in 2013, a 7.0 per cent fall from 9,330 deaths in 2003

• 2,381 men died from cancers of the genital organs in 2013, a 9.7 per cent fall from 2,636 in 2003

Spelthorne in the South West recorded the largest fall in the death rate over the decade of 39.1 per cent.

For both men and women the first and second most common forms of cancer leading to death were cancers of the digestive organs, the disease of the respiratory and intrathoracic organs. 

North East (68% are overweight or obese)

North West 66%

West Midlands 65.7%

East Midlands 65.6%

Yorkshire and the Humber 65.4%

East of England 65.1%

South East 63.1%

South West 62.7%

London 57.3% 

For men the third most common form of the disease was cancers of the genital organs - testicular, prostate and penile cancers - while for women it was breast cancer. 

HSCIC chair Kingsley Manning said: 'As the report shows, cancer kills more people under 75 than any other cause and so most of us will have been touched in some way by this.

'So many people will take a keen interest in these statistics and the story they tell about the overall drop across the country and the different pictures in local areas.' 

A report published yesterday by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) found the spiralling obesity epidemic costs the UK economy £47 billion each year.

It found the burden of treating and caring for those who are overweight or obese has the second largest impact after smoking.   

They predict a series of 44 interventions could bring 20 per cent of overweight or obese people in the UK back to normal weight within five to 10 years.  

It would save around £16 billion a year in UK, including an annual saving of about £766 million in the NHS, according to the study. 

It comes as a report by the McKinsey Global Institute found obesity costs the UK economy a staggering £47 billion each year - the same as war and terrorism, and just a shade less than smoking

The study found the UK Government's efforts to tackle obesity were 'too fragmented to be effective', while investment in obesity prevention was 'relatively low given the scale of the problem.'

The UK spends less than £638 million a year on obesity prevention programmes - about 1 per cent of the country's social cost of obesity, researchers said.

But the country spends about £6 billion a year on the medical costs of conditions related to being overweight or obese and a further £10 billion on diabetes.

Meanwhile, the cost of obesity and diabetes to the NHS is equivalent to the UK's combined 'protection' budget for the police and fire services, law courts, and prisons. 

The current rate of obesity and overweight conditions suggest the cost to the NHS could increase from between £6 billion and £8 billion in 2015 to between £10 billion and £12 billion in 2030, the study found.  

MGI director Richard Dobbs said: 'Efforts to address obesity have been piecemeal up till now. 

'Yet obesity is a systemic issue, born of many interlocking factors, and only a systemic response will do.'
