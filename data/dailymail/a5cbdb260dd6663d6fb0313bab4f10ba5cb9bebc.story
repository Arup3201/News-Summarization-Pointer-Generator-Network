A Chinese-born Australian artist has reportedly been arrested in China following his recent media interview about the student-led protest and military crackdown in June 1989, also known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

Although Australian authorities are yet to confirm whether Guo Jian has been detained by police, it is believed the 52-year-old made contact with friends via text message to inform them that he'd been taken from his home in eastern Beijing on Sunday night.

The former soldier has also caused a stir with his latest art work - a diorama of Tiananmen Square covered in 160kg of minced pork.

Chinese-Australian artist Guo Jian reportedly contacted friends by text message to inform them that he had been arrested by police in Beijing and will be detained until June 15

The alleged arrest comes after a profile of Guo, a former protester in China's 1989 pro-democracy movement, appeared in the Financial Times newspaper on May 30 in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the military crackdown on the student protest centered around the large city square.

The article also featured images of his latest installation 'The Square' covered in ground meat - which had turned a greyish green hue due to the hot weather - was created by the artist as he 'wanted to do something privately to mark the anniversary'.

Guo was also highly critical of the People's Liberation Army's actions during the 1989 incident.

'The army is regarded as a loveable institution. But at Tiananmen I realised it’s not, they will kill you if ordered to. And how do they build up this machine? In part, they use women,' he said in the interview.

Discussions of the protest and its military suppression are taboo in China as authorities tighten security ahead of the anniversary each year.

Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Australian embassy in Beijing was attempting to confirm with Chinese authorities that the former soldier had been detained.

'As an Australian citizen, we'll do what we can to release him if the case is he's been detained,' she told Sky News television in the Australian capital, Canberra.

An Associated Press reporter spoke to the controversial artist as he was taken away from his home in suburban Beijing on Sunday night. Guo also told friends he would be held by police until June 15.

This is the latest in a string of detentions of artists, lawyers, scholars and journalists ahead of the Tiananmen anniversary amid intense government efforts to deter coverage by foreign media of its remembrance.

After a stint as a soldier, Guo was studying art in Beijing when he was swept into the 1989 student protests and witnessed the military action that began on the night of June 3, 1989.

'I didn't believe it, even though I had been a soldier,' Guo said in the article.

'In the army I had never seen that sort of violence. Then I saw the tracers and people falling around me - they were just gone.'

This year's suppression has been harsher than in previous years, as police round up activists who had received no more than warnings in the past.

Since early May, the authorities have detained or put under house arrest dozens of people, including prominent human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, in an attempt to prevent any commemoration. Other activists have been warned by the authorities not to speak to foreign media.

Police also have cautioned foreign journalists not to cover any sensitive issues leading up to the anniversary or face 'serious consequences'.

A French broadcaster said its journalists were interrogated for six hours by Beijing police when they were found interviewing people on the street about the events 25 years ago. The journalists were forced to say in front of a police video camera that they did something 'very sensitive' that could cause 'disturbance', and promise not to do it in the next several days, before police returned their press cards, the broadcaster said.

The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China condemned the practices and called for them to halt.

Guo has since removed the minced pork on his miniature model as the meat had rotten.
