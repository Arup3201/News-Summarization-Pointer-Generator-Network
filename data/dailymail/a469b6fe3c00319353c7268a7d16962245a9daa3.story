Hundreds of mourners, including Springboks skipper Jean de Villiers, paid tribute to South Africa captain Senzo Meyiwa, who was shot dead on Sunday, during a moving memorial service in Johannesburg on Thursday.

The Standard Bank Arena was packed full as people united to pay tribute to Meyiwa and two other South African sports figures who died in the past few days. Former world champion 800-meter runner Mbulaeni Mulaudzi was killed in a car crash on Friday and female boxer Phindile Mwelase died on Saturday.

South Africa have been allowed to move their next African Cup of Nations qualifier to the hometown of the slain national team captain  as a tribute.

South African Football Association President Danny Jordaan made the announcement at the memorial service  and also promised a statue of the goalkeeper would be built to stand outside SAFA's headquarters at Soccer City in Johannesburg.

The goalkeeper was shot and killed in an apparent house robbery on Sunday, unleashing dismay and anger in South Africa over the violent death of one of its most popular players.

Meyiwa had captained South Africa to the top of their qualifying group and was yet to concede a goal in qualifying, putting Bafana Bafana on the brink of sealing a place at next year's continental championship.

To honor Meyiwa, SAFA was given special permission by the Confederation of African Football to move next month's qualifier against Sudan from Nelspruit in the north to Meyiwa's hometown of Durban on the east coast, Jordaan said. South Africa will qualify for the Cup of Nations if they win.

The game on November 15 will now be played at Moses Mabhida Stadium, where Meyiwa's funeral will be held on Saturday.

Meyiwa was fatally shot while visiting his girlfriend in Vosloorus township near Johannesburg. He was attempting to protect Kelly Khumalo during a robbery at her home.

The 27-year-old skippered his club side Orlando Pirates in their 4-1 win against Ajax Cape Town on Saturday night, and was pictured looking happy with girlfriend Khumalo, a South African pop star, earlier on Sunday.

But the South African police service say Meyiwa was fatally shot when armed men broke into the house where he was staying at around 8pm..

Police are hunting three suspects in the shooting and have offered a reward of around £14,000 to catch them. 

On Thursday, Jordaan challenged South Africans - who are used to high levels of violent crime - to hand in illegal guns, which he said will be put in a furnace and melted down to build Meyiwa's statue. Jordaan said the more illegal guns given up, the bigger Meyiwa's statue would be.

'That statue will stand in front of SAFA House and when you walk into SAFA House, you must walk past Senzo,' Jordaan said.

Meyiwa had been in superb form for both club and country recently, leading Orlando Pirates to last season's African Champions League final, including a superb performance against TP Mazembe during which he saved two penalties. 

Since breaking into the national team last year, he claimed the No 1 spot in the absence of Itumeleng Khune, and was made captain in September.

The South African goalkeeper played for Orlando Pirates from 2006, becoming first choice for the club in 2012.

In 2008 he swapped shirts with Wayne Rooney when Manchester United played the Pirates in a pre-season friendly in Durban.

In 2013 his performances in the African Champions League were nothing short of exceptional. He kept seven clean-sheets in 16 games, helping the Pirates to the final.

After making his debut in 2013 against Swaziland, Meyiwa won six caps for South Africa, the most recent coming this month, as captain.

During the current Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign Meyiwa has played all four games for South Africa, without conceding a single goal.

In September he was made captain of the national team in the absence of Itumeleng Khune.
