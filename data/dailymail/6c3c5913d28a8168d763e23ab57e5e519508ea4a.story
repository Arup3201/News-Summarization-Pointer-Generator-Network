Clueless actress turned Fox News contributor Stacey Dash issued an apology this week following comments she made regarding the issue of rape at UVA that many saw as unabashed victim blaming.

The controversy started after an appearance on Fox's Outnumbered, when the outspoken conservative said the school's recent ban on sorority members attending frat events was unfair to 'good girls' when it's the 'bad girls -- bad women -- or the ones who like to be naughty, [who] might go out and play and get hurt.'

'But the other thing about this is that it then blames the alcohol instead of the person who over-drinks. It's the same thing with guns. Guns don't kill people; people kill people,' she continued.

Apologized: Clueless actress turned Fox News contributor Stacey Dash issued an apology this week following comments she made regarding the issue of rape at UVA that many saw as unabashed victim blaming

Critics quickly pounced and said the 48-year-old's comments excused sexual assaults on 'bad girls' who choose to drink alcohol.

And on Monday, Dash responded by clarifying what she meant via a Facebook post in which she called her 'naughty girl' comments 'a failed attempt at humor.'

Dash continued:

'LET ME BE CLEAR: I am a victim of physical and sexual abuse. My point was that there IS NO EXCUSE for a man taking advantage of women under any circumstances. 

'I believe that these universities focusing on alcohol consumption as a means to stop evil behavior takes the focus off the real issue of the objectification of women and how that can be prevented. 

Dash apologized via Facebook, where she called herself a victim of assault

'I apologize to anyone who believed I was blaming the victims of these horrible acts.'

While the response was enough to quiet most critics, at least one found the apology offensive in its own right.

In her article titled 'Look, Stacey Dash, We Thought You Were Victim-Blaming Sexual Assault Survivors Because You Were Victim-Blaming Them', Kirsten West Savali of The Root wrote:

'If Dash had said that the ban was "ridiculous" because it disempowers women, that would have been a more solid argument. Instead, in some sort of conservative-talk-show sleight of hand, she used the misguided ban to attack the character of "naughty" girls who get hurt when they "go out and play."'

Dash implied that 'naughty girls' who go out and drink are somehow to blame for sexual assault
