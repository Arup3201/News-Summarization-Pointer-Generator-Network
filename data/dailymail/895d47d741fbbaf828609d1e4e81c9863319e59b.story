Livingston have been hammered with a five-point deduction and £10,000 fine for non-payment of tax.

At a SPFL disciplinary hearing on Monday, the club admitted rule breaches after failing to advise the governing body that it had previously been in ‘default of its tax obligations in relation to payments made to players’.

Had the league hierarchy been made aware of the issue, Livingston would have been banned from signing players during past transfer windows.

The stringent punishment handed down by the SPFL pushes the West Lothian outfit seven points adrift of Cowdenbeath at the foot of the Championship.

Livingston chairman Gordon McDougall attended the hearing and said: ‘The club are working with their accountants and HMRC to establish exactly how much tax is due to be paid. We will be making no further comment on the situation.’

SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said: ‘The tax default and reporting rules are an integral part of maintaining a fair league competition.’

Livingston are already operating under a registration embargo because of the case, having volunteered information in August.

In an open letter to the SPFL, the board alleged that former chief executive Ged Nixon, who resigned from the club last October, paid undeclared bonuses to players and then manager Gary Bollan in 2010 and 2011. Both the players and Bollan deny receiving such money.

Prior to that release, Nixon had launched legal proceedings against the club in a bid to recoup a £311,000 director’s loan. That case is due to be heard in March 2015.

Livingston could face yet more turmoil on Friday when the SFA is expected to finish hearing evidence in the complex case surrounding the shareholding of Neil Rankine.

Rankine owns 50 per cent of the shares in the company which owns the club.

Livingston have been charged by the governing body of breaching five rules relating to ownership after Rankine was accused of holding interests in both fellow Championship outfit Dumbarton and League Two side East Fife.

Rankine has said publicly that he is owed money from Dumbarton after selling the business in 2008 for £1.6million. He denies having any influence at East Fife.
