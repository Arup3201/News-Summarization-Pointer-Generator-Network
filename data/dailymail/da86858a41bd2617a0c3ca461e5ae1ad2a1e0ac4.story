Whenever the outspoken 39-year-old has posted messages online in recent days his remarks have been met with the response 'Parklife' - the name of one of band's best known hits.

Whenever Russell Brand has posted messages online in recent days his remarks have been met with the response 'Parklife' - the name of one of Blur's best known hits

Twitter user Dan Barker posted a line from the comedian's book and remarked that his writing 'feels like someone is about to shout "PARKLIFE!" at the end of every sentence'

Twitter users have wasted no time responding to Russell Brand's Tweets by repeatedly making reference to the Blur classic

It comes after Twitter user Dan Barker posted a line from the comedian's book and remarked that his writing 'feels like someone is about to shout "PARKLIFE!" at the end of every sentence'.

The 1994 song includes lines spoken by actor Phil Daniels, including 'Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as…' before Blur's lead singer Damon Albarn sings out the name of the hit.

Mr Barker pointed out that the song was a good fit for some of the comedian's comments - and his observation was retweeted thousands of times.

Twitter users have even been poking fun at some of Russell Brand's less controversial remarks

Since then, Twitter users have wasted no time responding to Brand's online comments by repeatedly making reference to the Blur classic.

The entertainer-turned-campaigner – said to be worth £15million - recently released a new book called Revolution, which he insisted was about giving ordinary people more of a say over their lives. 

Last week the Hollywood actor sparked controversy when he was the star guest on BBC Radio 4's flagship current affairs show 'Start the Week'.

He accused Nigel Farage of being a 'racist' – and David Cameron of only being 'marginally' less prejudiced. The multi-millionaire star also defended his call for people not to vote.

The comedian, who is said to be worth £15million, has continued to Tweet to his 8.5million followers 

But Twitter users have repeatedly responded to Russell Brand's posts with the word 'Parklife' 

The craze has resulted in a number of videos appearing online where Parklife has been remixed to include comments made by the entertainer

It came just days after he appeared on Newsnight and sparked fury by claiming the US government may have been responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks on New York.  

But in recent days, Twitter users have even been poking fun at some of his less controversial remarks.

In one Tweet he urged followers to watch him read 'Pied Piper' with an illustrator - only for users to repeatedly make reference to the Blur song.

It has even resulted in a number of videos appearing online where Parklife has been remixed to replace Phil Daniels' lines in the song with footage of the comedian and recordings of some of his comments

Mr Barker told Buzzfeed that another user @paperclipracket had made the observation before he did and hoped the comedian 'can eventually forgive me'.
