Wrapped up warm in his 80s retro ski gear of a turquoise jacket, blue hat and green trousers, the Prince of Wales looked perfectly content as he made his way down the slopes in Klosters last week.

Prince Charles, 64, was pictured smiling on a skiing holiday on Friday at the luxury resort in Graubünden, Switzerland, which has been a favourite with the royal for more than three decades.

Two years ago it was suggested that Charles would never again visit the millionaire’s playground because of his 64-year-old wife Camilla’s vertigo, hatred of the cold and lack of interest in skiing.

But ahead of a tour of Saudi Arabia 
with the Duchess of Cornwall, which begins tomorrow, Charles was seen 
back on the slopes where he regularly took Princes William and Harry as 
children.

The Swiss 
pictures were released ahead of the soon-to-be grandfather speaking of 
his concerns for Britain's rural areas in a special edition of the BBC 
One flagship Countryfile programme on tonight.

The
 Prince said it was important to ‘work in harmony with nature’ for the 
benefit of future generations and highlighted the problems facing many 
of the country's farming communities.

Charles
 spoke to Countryfile presenters Julia Bradbury and Matt Baker after he 
agreed to guest-edit the weekly rural affairs show, which airs tonight, 
as part of its 25th anniversary celebrations.

He said: ‘We need to think about what kind of world we're handing on to our successors, particularly grandchildren.

‘If you think of it in those terms, it should make us reflect a little bit about the way we do things so we don't ruin it for them.’

The Prince said smaller family farms faced ‘enormous’ problems due to uncertain sources of income and diseases such as Schmallenberg and tuberculosis affecting livestock.

He is shown visiting his rural initiatives aimed at improving the lives of people working in the countryside and the show features his organic farm in Gloucestershire, where he spoke about his favourite countryside activities of walking and building hedges.
