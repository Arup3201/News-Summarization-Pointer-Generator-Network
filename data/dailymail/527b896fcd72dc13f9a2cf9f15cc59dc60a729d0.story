Not many Chinese farmers can say they own a Lamborghini.

But, thanks 5,000 yuan (£500), some scrap metal and six months' hard work, Guo can make that very claim.

And although his vehicle measures only 2m in length and is 1m tall, it can reach speeds of up to 60mph.

This Chinese farmer, Guo, has built a mini replica Lamborghini as a present for his grandson

Comparison: The car cost 5,000 yuan (£500) to make and measures 2m in length and 1m in height

Guo built the vehicle with a rear-view mirror, a horn, a stereo and even has a reverse gear

According to the Zhengzhou Evening News, Guo, who is in his 50s, spent six months working on the car.

He also bought Lamborghini logos to stick on to the car’s engine hood and steering wheel.

‘It's just a toy for my grandson,’ he said.

‘But I can drive him to school in it. It's much better than an electric bike.’

The car is made out of mainly scrap metal and motorcycle parts.

It also has five sets of batteries and can travel as far as 37 miles when fully charged, according to local reports.
