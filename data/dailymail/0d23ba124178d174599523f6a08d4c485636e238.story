For newlyweds Danielle and Justin Foley their big day simply wouldn’t have been complete without a picture with their beloved pet Coco the cat.

Unfortunately for the happy couple their feline friend wasn’t about to play ball just because it was supposed to be a happy occasion.

Poor Coco looks like she’s possessed by an evil spirit in this pictured taken by wedding photographer Luciana Justice.

A wedding not to forget: Danielle and Justin Foley's big day wouldn't have been complete without a picture with their beloved pet Coco the cat

Model behavior: Coco shows that she can pose nicely for the camera when she chooses

Other photographs show Coco is more than capable of taking a lovely photograph, but as any cat owner knows a moggy won’t always do what you want them too.

Danielle and Justin's wedding took place July 6 at the couple’s home in Houston, Texas. 

It was a small affair with about 20 guests and Coco joined the party, although only because her dinner was in the middle of it.

Bride Danielle has described Coco – a rescue animal - as ‘viciously beautiful and beloved.’

Bad day: Another snap of Coco from the wedding suggests that perhaps she wasn't having the best of days
