Drones are fast becoming a videographer's favourite new toy when it comes to changing our perceptions of scenery, animals and events.

We celebrate some of the most astonishing  footage on the internet with a montage featuring everything from dolphins and whales to castles and fireworks - all captured from above. 

Some of the footage sees a mini quadcopter soaring through abandoned buildings covered in graffiti and performing aerial acrobatics in Virginia City, Nevada.   

In other shots a drone flies through a giant fireworks display over West Palm Beach, Florida - and remarkably landed afterwards undamaged. 

Captain Anderson of Captain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Safari in Dana Point, California is behind the dolphin footage.

He filmed a mega-pod of thousands of common dolphins stampeding off Dana Point, California. 

He says of the experience, 'I learned so much about these whales and dolphins from this drone footage that it feels like I have entered a new dimension! 

Footage shows a camera whizzing around deserted building and slicing through trees at great speed

'I have not been this excited about a new technology since we built our underwater viewing pods on our whale watching boat. Drones are going to change how we view the animal world.'

The whale footage was caught by Eric Sterman and shot on the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii. He used a Dronefly and Gopro Hero 3+ to follow the whales up to a mile out to sea while he navigated from  land.

In another shot a drone slowly flies over a beautiful castle in a move that requires two people to pilot the aircraft from the ground. 

One steered the hexadrone - a six armed drone - used to get the shot and the second manoeuvred the camera  to perfect it.

This drone took two people to fly it and shows majestic views of a castle
