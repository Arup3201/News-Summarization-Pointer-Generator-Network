Mead is making an unlikely comeback thanks to a surge of interest among trendy youngsters in the medieval brew

It was a favoured tipple for characters in Beowulf and Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales.

And now mead is making an unlikely comeback thanks to a surge of interest among trendy youngsters in the medieval brew.

The honey-based drink romanticised in Norse legend and medieval tales is being sold increasingly to supermarkets and restaurants, brewers have said.

There has been a huge spike in demand in the past six months, after the drink became fashionable in America, where there are now almost 250 meaderies.

In the UK, mead brewers in Cornwall  are now selling about 50,000 litres of mead a year and a new London-based producer makes 2,500 bottles a month, with capacity for double that amount.

It is thought young drinkers have led the trend, with the drink being used in cocktails and sauces at top restaurants.

It follows the rise of craft beer, now a common sight in pubs across the country.

Sarah Thompson, the director of Lurgashall Winery in West Sussex, said that mead was previously an ‘underground drink, popular with medieval re-enactment groups, pagans, and students’.

‘But we’ve seen a big difference in attitude in the past six months. It’s one of the last drinks to have its comeback, after cider and gin. But it’s coming,’ she added.

Sophie Fenton runs Cornish Mead with her brother, Matthew Leiworthy.

‘We’re trying to start a new trend for using mead to make cocktails. It’s finding a new, younger market,’ she said.

Mead is referenced frequently in medieval literature, having been a popular drink at the time at weddings and special occasions.

It dates back to pagan times, when the bride and groom would drink mead for a month after their wedding.

The tradition was the origin for the term ‘honeymoon’.

The drink was available in Tudor times, with monasteries creating it as a by-product of beekeeping, but when the monasteries  were dissolved by King Henry VIII in the 16th century, mead largely disappeared.

In recent years, however, the brew has been reintroduced by top chefs including Britain's Simon Rogan at the L’Enclume restaurant in Cartmel, Cumbria, and Fera at Claridge’s in Mayfair – and René Redzepi, the chef at Noma restaurant in Denmark, rated as the best in the world.

Tom Gosnell started brewing Gosnells London Mead in Peckham, south London, at the end of last year.

He now produces the drink for restaurants in London and as far as Edinburgh.

While mead was traditionally very alcoholic, with a content of about 16 or 17 per cent, Mr Gosnell’s is 5.8 per cent and made using Spanish blossom honey.

‘I wanted a modern twist; something that was easier to drink and more accessible,’ he told The Independent on Sunday.

Chet Sharma, the head of research and development at Simon Rogan’s L’Enclume, said the restaurant makes a modern mead based on elderflower.

‘The only difference between mead and beer is they use malt as their sugar source instead of honey. Why can’t there be as much diversity in mead as there is in craft beer?’ he said.

Legend has it that mead is a powerful
 aphrodisiac, enhancing virility and fertility - an unfortunate 
side-effect considering it is thought first to have been drunk in the UK
 and Ireland by monks.

It 
was most likely discovered by accident, with thirsty men drinking 
rainwater from a beehive, unaware that fermentation will have occurred 
and that they would become intoxicated.

The
 term ‘honeymoon’ refers to the pagan tradition for brides and grooms to
 drink mead, made from honey, at their wedding and for a month 
afterwards.

The drink has 
been described in books for centuries. More recently, it was the 
alcoholic beverage of choice for many in the Harry Potter series and 
almost killed Ron Weasley, when he drank a glass of oak-matured mead, 
which had been poisoned.

Chaucer’s
 Canterbury Tales referenced mead as a drink for urban lovers. In the 
Miller’s Tale, Chaucer (right) wrote: ‘He sent her sweetened wine and 
well-spiced ale and waffles piping hot out of the fire, and, she being 
town-bred, mead for her desire.’ 

Mead’s
 chief ingredient is honey but modern versions play with the flavour, 
adding elderflower, dried fruit and a range of unusual herbs and spices.

In
 ancient Greece, mead was called Ambrosia or Nectar and was said to be 
the drink of the gods, descended from heaven as dew before being 
gathered by bees.

The drink
 was brewed with herbs and spices to treat a number of illnesses and 
became known as Metheglin, from the Welsh word ‘medcyglin’, meaning 
medicine. When mixed with the borage or starflower herb it was used on 
hypochondriacs.
