Google will claim solidarity with thousands of websites preparing to 'go dark' at midnight tonight, Eastern Time, in protest against draconian plans to police the 
internet and combat piracy.

Some of the world's biggest tech 
companies are planning to take part in the blackout, including 
Wikipedia, Mozilla, Reddit and WordPress.

But the search giant has ruled out the possibility of blacking out itself. Google instead said it would change its home page to show its support.

'Like many businesses, entrepreneurs and web users, we oppose these bills because there are smart, targeted ways to shut down foreign rogue websites without asking American companies to censor the Internet,' a Google spokeswoman wrote in a statement seen by the Huffington Post.

'So tomorrow we will be joining many other tech companies to highlight this issue on our U.S. home page.'

Wikipedia is to shut down its 
English-language site. An estimated 100 million people will be
affected by the one-day closure of Wikipedia alone, which has 
become a vital tool for businesses and students.

Jimmy Wales, who founded the site, warned students via Twitter to ‘do your homework early’ ahead of the shutdown.

The blackout is part of a widespread protest 
campaign orchestrated via social sites such as Reddit - and other 
internet heavyweights such as browser company Mozilla are to join in. 

They are angry about the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA), which are going before the U.S. Congress.

Twitter is not joining in the protest. Its CEO Dick Costolo said at the weekend that applying single-nation politics to a worldwide service was 'foolish'.

However co-founder Jack Dorsey did stand with other top tech companies who wrote an open letter to Congress last month warning of the dangers that SOPA would bring to business and innovation.

The laws are designed to  prevent online pirates from making music, film, television shows and eBooks available  free of charge.

However,
critics argue they go much further and amount to an attempt to control 
and censor the internet, so curtailing freedom of expression.

The Stop Online Piracy Act and the 
Protect Intellectual Property Act in Congress - designed to 
crack down on sales of pirated U.S. products overseas - has pit internet giants, consumer groups and freedom of speech advocates against film studios and record labels.

The
House bill (SOPA) would allow a private party to go straight to a 
website's advertising and payment providers and request they sever ties.

Supporters include the film and music 
industry, which often sees its products sold illegally. They say the 
legislation is needed to protect intellectual property and jobs.

Critics say the legislation could hurt 
the technology industry and infringe on free-speech rights. Among their 
concerns are provisions that would weaken cyber-security for companies 
and hinder domain access rights.

The
most controversial provision is in the House bill, which would have 
enabled federal authorities to 'blacklist' sites that are alleged to 
distribute pirated content. That would essentially cut off portions of 
the Internet to all U.S. users. But congressional leaders appear to be 
backing off this provision.

Supporters say the legislation is 
needed to protect intellectual property and jobs. Critics say the 
legislation is too broad and could hurt the technology industry and 
infringe on free-speech rights.

There are also fears they will give 
the U.S. authorities even greater powers to pursue alleged law-breakers 
on both sides of the Atlantic.

Last week, UK courts decided to extradite British student Richard O’Dwyer to the U.S. on charges of online piracy.

In theory, the 23-year-old could be 
jailed for ten years for setting up the TVShack website, which provided 
links to free pirate downloads of films and TV programmes.

His defenders claim he is small fry in
the piracy industry and say Google, which has huge financial and 
political muscle, is a major player.

Google has never been prosecuted even 
though its search engine gives links to many sites that offer illegal 
streaming or pirate downloads of films, music, TV shows and eBooks.

Wales said in a statement: 'Today Wikipedians from around the world have spoken about their opposition to this destructive legislation.

'This is an extraordinary action for our community to take - and while we regret having to prevent the world from having access to Wikipedia for even a second, we simply cannot ignore the fact that SOPA and PIPA endanger free speech both in the United States and abroad, and set a frightening precedent of Internet censorship for the world.'

According to a press release, users of the site have discussed for more than a month whether it should react to the legislation and, in the past few days, tried to decide how.

The foundation behind the site, Wikimedia, said it collected input from users over a period of 72 hours before making its final decision on Monday evening based on that feedback.

'This is by far the largest level of participation in a community discussion ever seen on Wikipedia, which illustrates the level of concern that Wikipedians feel about this proposed legislation,' a statement on the Wikimedia Foundation website reads.

'The overwhelming majority of 
participants support community action to encourage greater public action
in response to these two bills.'

'Of the proposals considered by 
Wikipedians, those that would result in a "blackout" of the English 
Wikipedia, in concert with similar blackouts on other websites opposed 
to SOPA and PIPA, received the strongest support.'

Mr Wales told the BBC: ‘Proponents of 
the Stop Online Piracy Act have characterised the opposition as being 
people who want to enable piracy or defend piracy.

‘But that’s not really the point. The 
point is the bill is so over broad and so badly written that it’s going 
to impact all kinds of things that don’t have anything to do with 
stopping piracy.’

Social news community Reddit has already announced that it will 'go dark' on Wednesday to protest against the bill.

High-profile blog BoingBoing has also announced that it will protest.

Browser maker Mozilla has
said that it also intends to protest by 'going dark' briefly and 
hosting anti-SOPA content, although copies of its Firefox browser will 
continue to work as normal.

Comedy network Cheezburger (host of Failblog) also said it will join in.

Several sites such as SopaStrike offer 'do it yourself' kits for smaller websites to 'go dark' in protest at SOPA.

SopaStrike hosts a list of smaller sites that have said they will black out in protest.

Not all sites who join the protest will 'switch off' entirely - some will host banners or turn the front page black instead.

Facebook has voiced opposition to the bill but has not committed to any form of protest this week.

Twitter will not join in - its CEO said that applying single-nation politics to a worldwide service was 'foolish'.

He claimed the proposals were part of a wider attempt by governments to regulate the internet.

‘All around the world, we’re seeing 
the development of legislation intended to fight online piracy, and 
regulate the internet in other ways, that hurt online freedoms.’

Barack Obama has hinted he may water 
down the proposals, which would remove the possibility of Google and 
others being prosecuted for directing people to pirate websites.

Big Brother Watch, the UK civil liberties campaign group, backed the  protest.

Its director Nick Pickles said: ‘The 
proposals represent a blunt attack on freedom of speech, based upon a 
deeply flawed understanding of how the internet works.’

A large-scale blackout is 
expected from midnight Eastern Standard Time on Tuesday 
until midnight on Wednesday.

'We are looking at a powerful protest,' said Jay Walsh, spokesman for the foundation.

Tech
companies such as Facebook, Yahoo and others have also 
questioned the legislation and said it poses a serious risk to the 
industry.

Several online communities such as Reddit, BoingBoing and others have announced plans to go blackout in protest.

The Obama administration has also raised concerns about the legislation.

The administration said over the weekend that it will work with Congress on legislation to help battle piracy and counterfeiting while defending free expression, privacy, security and innovation in the Internet.
