Two men were killed Sunday evening in a plane crash while filming a low-budget zombie movie in Central Florida.

Dennis Monroe, 65, was piloting the small single-engine airplane around 7:30pm while 70-year-old Joseph Sardinas filmed him from the back seat.

The two men were in the air about Monroe Airpark in Summerfield for about an hour before witnesses heard the engine stall and the plane took a nose dive.

'Then all of a sudden the last pass around, the sound stopped and it just dropped,' neighbor Jennifer Crandall told WESH.

'They were neighbors and very nice neighbors, they've been here for years and years, Ms Crandall added. 'He's flown for years, had his own plane, he built that plane, he'd fly quite regularly.'

Both Monroe and Sardinas were killed instantly.

The two were filming the finale to zombie film 'What Tomorrow Brings' and according to Monroe County fire officials, there were 'lots of extras' nearby at the time.

'It could've been much worse, because if it came down where all those people were it could've been very tragic,' Ms Crandall remarked.

According to the film's Facebook page, 'What Tomorrow Brings' follows the lives of seven people as they fight to survive as zombies takeover Ocala, Florida. 

One of the filmmakers posted an event invitation for the shoot of the 'epic movie finale'.

'What Tomorrow Brings is hitting the skies with an explosive airplane finale sequence filming!!!!

'...There will be planes. There will be guns. And, of course, zombies!' the post read.

Agents with the Federal Aviation Association and National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the crash site Monday.

Monroe was flying a Van's RV-7 plane, a single-engine, two-seat plane that is sold in kits to be assembled by the owner.

Monroe, from Summerfield, was the public works director and neighbors said he built the plane years ago.
