Under pressure: Christopher Bailey with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley

Burberry shareholders have voted against an ‘obscene’ £28million pay package received by the new boss of the fashion house.

Chief executive Christopher Bailey was handed 1.35million shares in the business prior to taking the top job earlier this year.

But in a humiliating blow for the company, 53 per cent of investors voted against the controversial measure – one of the biggest revolts in British boardroom history.

It is only the sixth time that a major UK firm has seen its pay arrangements defeated in a ballot.

However, it is likely Mr Bailey will get  to keep the awards because the vote is  not binding.

The Burberry boss, who had been creative director at the design label, was appointed to the top job earlier this year, replacing Angela Ahrendts who left to join technology giant Apple.

From the outset Mr Bailey’s pay and perks have raised eyebrows.

As well as a base salary of £1.1million and pension contributions of £330,000, he was entitled to receive up to £6.6million from two annual incentive schemes.

He was handed free shares worth £1.8million when he took the post and an executive discount of 80 per cent.

Mr Bailey also receives an unexplained ‘cash allowance’ of £440,000, which is paid in monthly instalments. The company refused to say what this was for.

But the measure that galled shareholders was free shares worth £20million, handed to him before he took the job and only disclosed once he became chief executive – a post that requires the firm to reveal his rewards.

Unlike most schemes used by other companies, Mr Bailey is due to receive a payout from these shares irrespective of Burberry’s performance, providing he stays with the firm for five years.

The Investment Management Association, which advises pension funds on how to vote, gave the company an ‘amber’ warning over the scale of its pay deals, and corporate governance group Pirc labelled the payouts ‘excessive’.

Burberry chairman Sir John Peace, who is now facing calls to resign, told shareholders at the London meeting that it was ‘essential that we retain Christopher in the business’.

He warned 
that a rival firm had tried to poach the executive, who will also keep 
his position as creative director, and that Burberry had to open its 
cheque book to keep him.

Was handed to him before he took the job and only disclosed once he became chief executive)POTENTIAL TOTAL: £28million

But
 the argument did not wash with shareholders and 53 per cent of them 
voted against the group’s pay arrangements of the past year.

Speaking
 after the meeting, Sir John said it was ‘disappointing’ that 
shareholders did not back the awards – but pointed out there was nothing
 they could do to stop them.’

He added: ‘What we have to do is reflect 
on that and talk  to shareholders.’

Shareholders
 vote twice on pay – once on the directors’ rewards from the past year 
and once on the company’s pay policies going forward.

The
 vote on pay from the past year is only symbolic, because the directors 
have already received the money and it would be impractical to claw it 
back.

But the ballot on future pay arrangements is binding.

Yesterday only 16 per cent of shareholders voted against Burberry’s forthcoming pay policies.

Deborah
 Hargreaves, director of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘The message to 
Burberry is loud and clear – multimillion-pound pay packages are 
obscene, unnecessary and will damage the economy in the long-term.

‘If
 those at the top are seen to grab such vast rewards while wages 
stagnate for everybody else, it completely undermines public faith in 
business.’

Chief executive: Christopher Bailey, who was appointed to the job earlier this year

When he took the job as boss of Burberry, Christopher Bailey knew he had one man to thank more than any other.

The fashion veteran’s interest in design and technology was sparked by his electrician grandfather, who bought him the latest gadgets as he was growing up – as well as his first Burberry trench coat.

The son of a carpenter, Mr Bailey studied at the Royal College of Art before being headhunted by Donna Karan for the post of creative director of women’s collections.

The American fashion designer was so taken with the young graduate’s work that she is said to have stripped in front of him just three minutes into their meeting in order to try on his collection.

Mr Bailey rose to senior designer at Gucci before being poached by Burberry in 2001, when he became part of a team that increased the value of the business from £1.1billion to £6.5billion.

Now 43 and in a civil partnership with actor Simon Woods, he has taken one of the most prestigious jobs in the fashion world by becoming chief executive.

But he will also keep his position as creative chief. Part of his success in the role was linking the firm to its British heritage while modernising the brand.

He has said he will donate 10 per cent of his salary after tax to the Burberry Foundation which supports disadvantaged children.
