Facebook is getting rid of a privacy feature that let users limit who can find them on the social network.

Facebook Inc released a statement Thursday saying it was removing a setting that controls whether users could be found when people type their name into the website's search bar.

The company warned about the change last year.

Found on Facebook: The social network announced yesterday that it would be removing an old privacy feature which allowed users to keep their names hidden in the search results

Facebook says only a single-digit percentage of the nearly 1.2 billion people on its network were using the setting.

Those still using the feature will be reminded about the switch in upcoming weeks.

The change comes as Facebook is building out its search feature, which people often use to find people they know — or want to know — on the site.

Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer Michael Richter wrote that the option had become confusing for some users.

'People told us that they found it confusing when they tried looking for someone who they knew personally and couldn't find them in search results, or when two people were in a Facebook Group and they couldn't find each other through search.'

Facebook, which is based in Menlo Park, California, says users can protect their privacy by limiting the audience for each thing they post about themselves.
