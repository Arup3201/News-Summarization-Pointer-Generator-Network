New York Mayor Bill de Blasio should have stayed at City Hall today instead of showing his face at Citi Field. 

The mayor threw the first pitch at the Mets opening day game but was booed by fans in the stadium twice, once when his name was announced and again when he took to the pitcher's mound.

But the boos didn't have anything to do with de Blasio's performance. The mayor practiced his 'knuckle ball' with son Dante at the Park Slope Armory last night and he successfully threw a strike to catcher Travis d'Arnaud.

Fans in the crowd said booing for politicians is common at Citi Field.

'I think they just booed because he's the mayor,' 35-year-old Robin Junicic told the New York Daily News.' 'They would have booed for any political figure.'

But Junicic's cousin added that 'it wasn't just a few boos'.

'I heard a lot of boos,' Indira Junicic said.

Before he took the mound, Mayor de Blasio seemed to expect a cold welcome from the Mets faithful, who braved the 45-degree whether to attend the 1pm game.

'I think everyone's going to be too cold to respond,' de Blasio said.

'But whatever it is, it is,' he added. ;I'm a sports fan. I think sports fans have a right to express themselves anyway they want.'

De Blasio, a diehard Red Sox fan, wore a Mets cap and jersey over dress pants but played homage to his favorite team with the number on his shirt.

The mayor was also joined on the field by a group of children from an East Harlem tutorial program who were affected by the recent gas explosion that leveled two apartment buildings and killed eight.

After the pitch, de Blasio retreated to the stands where he ate an Italian sausage while watching the game from near the Mets dugout.

In the fifth inning he disappeared to a private suite where her mingled with the Mets owners and left in the seventh inning - just before the Mets lost their lead against the Washington Nationals.

The Mets opening day game resulted in a dissappointing loss in the 10th inning and some in the crowd were disgruntled at the mayor's early absence.

'It shows he has no heart. It's upsetting [the mayor leaving so early],' 33-year-old Matthew Lipskey told the New York Post. 'He's suppossed to be a leader. What does that show?'
