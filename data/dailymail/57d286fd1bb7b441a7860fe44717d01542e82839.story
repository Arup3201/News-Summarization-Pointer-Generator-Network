When Billy Browne's cat 'began to resent him' after suffering from a painful ear infection, the video director hit upon the perfect way to make it up to him.

He designed the animal his very own 'cat castle', and spent four hours stacking and cutting holes in cardboard boxes to build the impressive structure.

Mr Browne, from Victoria, Australia, used colourful tape to stick together the tower for Rufus - who was delighted with his new home.

Now the adorable five-minute video of the bizarre DIY project has gained cult status on YouTube and has been viewed more than 400,000 times.

The footage begins with Mr Brown, a commercial and music video director, explaining that his relationship with his pet had become strained following the ear infection that required Rufus to suffer painful treatment.

'I would return from work and he would run from me,' said Mr Browne. After the cat's ear healed, his owner wanted to give him a present that would make up for the unpleasant experience.

'It came to me in the shower where all great ideas come,' added Mr Browne. 'Rufus loves boxes.'

Labour of love: The sweet video has received more than 400,000 views on YouTube

The 33-year-old sketched out his plan at his kitchen table, looking to Rufus for input at every stage.

'The tower took four hours to build, the boxes were delivered by IKEA and cost 123 Australian dollars (£80),' he said.

The video, which is set to music by Mr Browne's brother Ollie's band, Parallel Lions, has received plenty of praise online.

One user wrote: 'On behalf of all cat lovers, I take my hat off, and thank you for showing us how much you care.'

Others called it 'sweet' and 'inspiring', with one commenter saying the clip had left them in tears.

Mr Browne insists he is not a born cat-lover, however. 'I was engaged to someone who wanted a cat,' he said. 'I am not a cat person, but we got him anyway.

'We broke up and he stayed with me and now we get along like housemates. I had a severe struggle with anxiety and he really helped having a friend around.

'I am not a crazy cat person I just love my little mate.

'The video was a bonus meant for friends but it has made a lot of people very happy which makes me happy.'
