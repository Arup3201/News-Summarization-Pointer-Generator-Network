Sunderland are in talks over a swap deal for Marcos Alonso and Modibo Diakite.

West Ham and Swansea have also shown interest in 23-year-old defender Alonso, who made 20 appearances on loan for the Black Cats last season.

However, Fiorentina are interested in a 
swap plus £2million cash after French defender Diakite spent part of the
 campaign on loan there. 

Loan star: Marcos Alonso could return for another spell at Sunderland

On the lookout: Black Cats boss Gus Poyet is trying to strengthen his squad

Diakite was deemed surplus to requirements at the Stadium of Light last January, playing nine times after his switch to the Serie A outfit.

Meanwhile, Sunderland want to sign Chelsea’s new £12million centre-half Kurt Zouma on loan for the season.

Loan star: Zouma signed for Chelsea in January but was immediately loaned back to Saint Etienne
