Sir Michael Parkinson  yesterday revealed he has prostate cancer.

The 78-year-old began radiotherapy last week after a routine medical led to the diagnosis.

In a candid interview, the veteran broadcaster said: ‘I have prostate cancer – and I must admit it is a bore. I am 78. Of course mortality is on the mind. But I’m not afraid.

‘I have been told to expect to make a full recovery. And that is the goal.’

He hopes to use his situation to raise awareness and encourage men to get themselves checked if they notice symptoms of the disease.

The Yorkshireman said: ‘On a  Friday night, in the pub, you’ll find yourself in a urinal. So try to hit the wall from 2ft.

‘If you can’t, go to the doctor. There may be no pain or discomfort. There may be no symptoms.

‘But get checked immediately.’

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in Britain with over 40,000 new cases a year.

Sir Michael said his wife Mary had been a ‘tremendous support’.

‘Once she realised I wouldn’t let it 
affect me, Mary was fine,’ he said. I don’t feel ill. And I will keep  
working. I have no intention of stopping working.’

Tests led to the cancer being confirmed in May, months after a routine medical last October indicated there could be a problem.

Sir Michael is having radiotherapy at West London’s Cromwell Hospital and his prognosis is good.

Outlining the ‘pain-free’ treatment, 
he said: ‘You lie in a tube. You drop your pants. No one sees you naked.
You lie there while a machine makes a gentle sound. There is no pain. 
For six minutes. It’s boring. In fact, I started memorising songs in my 
head that would last six minutes but I could never get the timing spot 
on.’

He added: ‘I’m not playing it down. 
The point I want to make is that if prostate cancer is identified early,
it is treatable and curable. All that concerns me now is for men around
the country to stop and take notice of any symptoms that might save 
their lives.

‘I’m not a softy. If you show the 
symptoms of this dreadful disease, get help. Cancer is very real. But it
is something you can only beat down if you stare it in the face. For 
that you need to be diagnosed.’

He said he wanted to make the most of 
his high profile to save lives, adding: ‘I am a journalist. I am also a 
public figure. With that comes a responsibility. And mine is to raise 
awareness for this disease.

Sir Michael’s chat show, Parkinson, was launched in 1971.

By its end in December 2007 he had interviewed more than 2,000 celebrities, among them the world’s biggest stars.

He has just finished a second series 
of Parkinson Masterclass for Sky Arts, in which he speaks to artists 
about their influences and  the creative process. 

The  journalist, who 
has three children and eight grandchildren, said that men find it 
difficult to deal with illness, adding: ‘Men are terrified of disease, 
which is not our fault.

‘But it’s ridiculous all the same. Live or die.

‘For any person reading this who might
think, “Yeah, there have been a few problems, but it will pass”, go to 
the doctor. Do it today. Honestly, it could save your life.’

Sir Michael, who lives in Berkshire, 
explained that the months of tests helped to prepare him to deal with 
the news that he had cancer.

He said: ‘I expected it so there wasn’t this great moment of fear.’

He will start treatment with three weeks of intensive radiotherapy.
