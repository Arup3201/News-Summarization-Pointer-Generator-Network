A new mother who suffered a devastating 19 miscarriages over 14 years has spoken of her joy at finally meeting her miracle baby.

Jo Short, 37, had been diagnosed with endometriosis - a gynaecological condition affecting almost two million women in the UK, where womb tissue grows painfully in other areas of the body - but she and her husband Steve were told by eight different medical consultants that this should not be affecting her ability to carry a baby to term.

The couple from Newport, Wales, appeared on ITV's Daybreak with their healthy baby Emily-Kate to explain that they successfully conceived her just months after Jo had pioneering surgery.

'It's been a real emotional rollercoaster, really quite difficult, but it's been well worth it', said Jo, holding Emily-Kate. 'The challenge was there's limited research into the link between endometriosis and miscarriage.

'The frustration was in being told by eight different consultants that everything was normal and to go away and keep trying.'

Steve added: 'The real difficulty is they tell you there is nothing categorically wrong. And every time you roll the dice and you get pregnant you hope something will change but you know deep down it won't.'Â

Jo explained that over the years she had had four laproscopies - a laser procedure that involves sticking a tiny telescope into the body to see what's happening inside and to carry out surgery - each to a depth of 2.5mm.

Each session would involve doctors removing parts of the womb tissue from inside her stomach, which would relieve the pain for about a year but still leave Jo miscarrying.

Then the couple met Cardiff consultant Richard Penketh who told her about a pioneering surgery being trialled in Canada that involved cutting back deeper than 2.5mm - all the way to healthy tissue.

'The ramifications for other women are huge,' said Dr Sarah Jarvis, who joined the couple on Daybreak. 'One miscarriage is utterly devastating.

Endometriosis is a common condition in which small pieces of the womb lining (the endometrium) are found outside the womb.

Endometriosis affects around 2 million women in the UK. Most of them are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40.

Endometriosis is a long-term (chronic) condition that causes painful or heavy periods. It often causes pain in the lower abdomen (tummy), pelvis or lower back. It may also lead to lack of energy, depression and fertility problems.

However, the symptoms of endometriosis can vary and some women have few symptoms or no symptoms at all.

'You don't lose a pregnancy, you lose a baby and everything that goes with it.

'As soon as you find out you're pregnant you're dreaming of them getting married! When you're ready to try again is when you're ready for that emotional reattachment.

'A couple who have had three miscarriages are at risk of having more - lots of women have one or two.

'The good news for a woman who's had recurrent miscarriages is that your chances of having a healthy baby are much greater than if you can't get pregnant in the first place. Getting pregnant in the first place is often a huge issue.

'This won't help everyone, but there may be women out there for whom it does.'
