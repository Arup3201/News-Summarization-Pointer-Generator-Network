When Simon Hayman's weight rocketed beyond 19 stone, he decided to do something about it.

But instead of sharing his diet plans, the Shropshire man, now 24, felt 'it was too embarrassing to tell my friends', and kept his new eating regime a secret from everyone apart from his mother.

But Simon is not alone when it comes to clandestine calorie-counting: one in three men admits to dieting in secret, even though 90 per cent of them want to lose a bit of weight.

A new survey by home delivery diet brand Diet Chef shows 31 per cent of men have been on a diet and kept it quiet.

Like Simon - who shocked his friends by dropping four stone on his hush-hush health kick - over 90 per cent of the men questioned want to lose weight, but nearly one in three would 
not divulge that they were dieting to friends or family.

When questioned, 14 per cent said they see diets as something only women do, and 25 per cent wouldn't tell families and friends out of sheer 
embarrassment.

Some 29 per cent worry they would be seen as vain, and 18 per cent worry their family and friends would tempt them to break their diet with 
sugary and fatty treats.

The average weight of the men questioned is 15st and 46 per cent of those want to lose an average of one to two stone to get to their perfect weight.

Over a third of 
the men questioned admitted to being unable to control their 
weight because they love eating chocolate - a passion still thought to be
the reserve of the fairer sex.

Pies and the full English are also two 
things men wish they could give up but just can't seem to resist, 29 per cent of
men wish they could avoid these moreish dishes but struggle to find 
tasty, healthy alternatives with 26 per cent of men admitting they can't bear to
eat salads as a main meal.

Kevin Dorren, Founder & Head 
Chef at Diet Chef UK, said: 'In modern society men are also very concerned about 
their appearance.

'We have had a steady increase in the number of men who
sign up to Diet Chef as it helps them bring a pattern of healthy eating
and portion control into their lives.

'A lot of the men use the diet 
plan specifically because it is a way for them to become healthy and see
steady progress whilst still enjoying complete meals and healthy 
snacks.'

Simon, who has lost over four and a half stone (63lbs)  in total on his secret diet, said: 'The best thing about losing the weight is
it is such a good feeling when you see friends or people you know that 
haven't seen you for a few weeks and the looks on their faces, they do a
double take and some even have to check if it is really you!

'It’s also
great that I can go shopping for clothes now and look at what I want to
buy rather than check there’s a size that will fit me before I decide 
if I like it or not!'
