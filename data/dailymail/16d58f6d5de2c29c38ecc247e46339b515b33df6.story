This is the terrifying moment a passenger threatened to kill the bus driver – because he missed his stop.

The unnamed American man screamed obscenities at the frightened driver in China and tried to climb into his booth, yelling 'I'm going to kill you b*****.'

But fellow passengers - including women and the elderly - ganged up on him and drove him off the bus - to the relief of everyone on board.

The violent outburst was filmed by a young woman who uploaded it to YouTube where it has been watched nearly 400,000 times.

Shocked passengers watch on as the tanned, muscular man screams at the driver: ‘You got a problem? Say you’re sorry.’

He then takes his cross-body bag off and squares up to the cowering driver while a brave male passenger tries to calm him down, before being told: ‘Shut the f*** up. What are you looking at you?’

After three long minutes, the man finally leaves the bus, still screaming obscenities.
