Michelle Obama has had an awkward start to her visit to Japan as she was pictured towering over Emperor Akihito and stumbling as she tried to bow, shake his hand and curtsey at once.

The First Lady, dressed in a florid combination of a blazer and skirt, dwarfed the Emperor in her silver stilettos, while he maintained his composure and smiled politely. She then squatted slightly while shaking his hand, seemingly trying to disguise the difference of height between them.

Mrs Obama, who is 5ft 9in tall, also caused embarrassment earlier in the day when she grabbed Akie Abe, wife of Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, in a hug-and-handshake combination while the Japanese First Lady was trying to bow.

I'm going in: Michelle Obama stumbles as she attempts an awkward combination of curtsey, western handshake and Japanese bow when meeting Emperor Akihito in Tokyo. Matters were not helped by the fact that she towers over him

Just nod and smile: The Japanese Emperor is the height of politeness as he greets Mrs Obama, who squats slightly as she tries to disguise the dramatic height difference between them

Don't look down on me: Mrs Obama is back to her full height, but the incline of her head indicates that she remains intensely aware of the fact that she is at least a head taller than Emperor Akihito, centre, and his wife, Empress Michiko, right

Excessive physical contact is frowned upon in Japan, and strict traditions govern the practice of bowing. Despite intensive etiquette coaching, successive U.S. officials have famously got it wrong.

In 2009, President Barack Obama was was photographed bending to nearly a 90 degree angle when he greeted the Japanese Emperor at the Imperial Palace. His efforts were widely mocked.

In another example of over-enthusiastic bowing, the President was pictured bowing to a robot in 2014 while the Japanese people around him remained upright.

In 1994, then-President Bill Clinton went to the other extreme, causing offence by inclining his head and shoulders forward and mysteriously pressing his hands together when he met the Emperor.

Awkwardness and tension underpins much of the First Lady's visit.

Her three-day trip is being described as a 'makeup call' after she 'snubbed' the Japanese by failing to accompany her husband during his state visit to Japan last year.

Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzō Abe, is due to make a reciprocal visit to America next month.

Mrs Obama's previous no-show  upset members of the Japanese establishment so deeply that one politician, Kazuyuki Hamada, made the outrageous claim that the Obamas were getting divorced, as the president had been using Secret Service agents to cover for his extramarital affairs.  

Worried: Japan's first lady listened attentively to Mrs Obama's speech, but it is likely that in the back of her mind, she was concerned about the prospect of further hug-and-handshakes

Big in Japan: Mrs Obama waves upon her arrival at Haneda International Airport in Tokyo, wearing a green printed dress from Kenzo’s Fall 2014 collection, which costs around $700, offset by a chunky belt. Her visit is being described as a 'makeup call' after she snubbed the country last year

Mrs Obama's trip comes at a time of high tension for Americans in Japan, as Tokyo police investigate phone calls threatening to kill U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and Alfred Magleby, the U.S. consul general based on the southern island of Okinawa.

Her arrival also coincides with a visit by former president Bill Clinton, who is in the country to deliver a keynote speech at the JFK International Symposium held at Waseda University in Tokyo.

During the five-day trip, Mrs Obama will also visit Cambodia - whose leader, Hun Sen, has a reputation for ruthlessness, and where child prostitution and human trafficking is rife - to highlight a campaign supporting education for girls. 

There were so far no details on the cost of the trip, but the First Lady's group spent $222,000 over two days in hotel expenses during her 2014 trip to China, the Washington Examiner reported.

Mrs Obama will then become the first sitting U.S. first lady to visit Cambodia, one of 11 countries participating in the Let Girls Learn initiative.

Cambodia's government is led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has a reputation for ruthlessness and little tolerance for dissent. The country also has child prostitution and human trafficking problems.

Evan Medeiros, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, told reporters that while in Cambodia, Mrs Obama plans to discuss the need for open and inclusive politics and highlight basic values and principles that are important to the U.S.

In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal earlier this week, Mrs. Obama called it a 'tragic waste of human potential' when 62 million girls worldwide are not in school.

'It is also a serious public-health challenge, a drag on national economies and global prosperity, and a threat to the security of countries around the world, including our own,' Mrs. Obama wrote in her online travel journal.

'This visit is part of a journey that began decades ago, back when I was a little girl.' 

YouTube celebrity Michelle Phan is joining Mrs. Obama in Tokyo to help spread awareness for the Let Girls Learn campaign, and pose questions to the first lady submitted through Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
