It's one of the biggest dates on the party calendar and one of the few which sees fashion heavy-hitters such as Natalie Massanet and Sir Philip Green hobnob with the A-list and models alike.

With so many style setters in one room, competition for the title of best dressed is fierce with party-goers pulling out all the stops to ensure they make headlines for all the right reasons.

But not everyone gets their look spot on. From the highs (Tamsin Egerton's glorious red skirt) to the lows (Courtney Love and Rihanna), FEMAIL reveals which BFA guests deserve a sartorial round of applause - and those who need to go back to style school.

LOOKING GOOD

Miss Perfect: Emma Watson has mastered the art of red carpet dressing and looks wonderfully understated in this elegant ensemble

Tamsin Egerton was the standout success of the night, with her chic red skirt and white top combining to make everyone else look a trifle over-dressed - but she wasn't the only one to shine.

'Tamsin Egerton looked gorgeous,' says fashion expert Simon Glazin. 'I always love red on a red carpet, and this mermaid skirt looked great on her. She's not the biggest star here, and she knows it, hence, she didn't try and compete with a gown. I admire that.'

Others to come top of the class included Emma Watson, who, as usual, offered a masterclass in low-key red carpet dressing and the night's big winner, Victoria Beckham.

'Emma Watson looked every inch the young starlet,' comments  Glazin. 'She loves to work the masculine look, and this is a masterclass at how to do it but still remain girly and current.

'This is actually a wide-leg jumpsuit, and the addition of the oversized Dior blazer is just perfect for her.'

Equally gorgeous were the two Delevigne sisters, Cara and Poppy, who both chose sequins in simple black and shimmering gold. Models Karlie Kloss and Erin O'Connor also pulled off glamorous gowns - leaving Glazin impressed. 

Style sisters: Both Delevigne sisters know a thing or two about fashion and, as usual, looked immaculate on the red carpet

Pretty dramatic: Pixie Geldof picked a figure-flattering prom shape in on-trend snake print while Kate Moss opted for a signature boho dress

Long lines: Olivia Palermo and Victoria Beckham can always be relied on to get it right and they didn't disappoint at the BFA's

'Leave it to the super models to show everyone how it's done,' he says. 'Karlie Kloss has everything to smile about in her gorgeous, sexy gown. It's like liquid silver has been poured and draped all over her.

'Erin O'Connor is equal parts drama and romance in Emilia Wickstead. I love how she always embraces her height and with the bold red lip, she looked devastatingly good.'

And O'Connor and Kloss weren't the only models to give the actresses a run for their money. Perennial fashion favourite Kate Moss proved that while she might be 40, she's certainly not over the hill when it comes to fashion. 

'Leave it to Kate Moss to parade around in something fun, flirty and retro,' says Glazin. 'Her Alexander McQueen bat-wing mini dress was a welcome relief from to all the long, floor-length gowns too. Big hair on Kate is brilliant.' 

Short and sweet: Proving that red carpet doesn't have to mean floor-length are Laura Carmichael, Tanya Burr and Anna Kendrick

Hollywood glamour: Victoria's Secret Angel Karlie Kloss and model Erin O'Connor wowed fans in sweeping floor-length dresses

Looking good: Model Laura Bailey was gorgeous in a fabulous floor-length pink gown while the ever-dapper Tom Ford sharpened up in a suit

Impressively pulled together though Moss and the model posse were, not all of them got it right, among them Naomi Campbell, whose dress was one of two halves - both ill-fitting.

'I love Naomi Campbell, but this is not OK,' says Glazin. 'It doesn't scream supermodel - more Morticia Addams on a bad day. The bottom half is creased, and for me, there's no excuse for that, especially early in the evening. 

'She should always stick to Versace for events like this. Donatella would have done her proud.'

Lily Donaldson, usually a classic dresser, attempted to inject a shot of sex appeal via a long, sheer skirt but ended up looking a little frumpy as a result of her Bridget Jones style underwear. 

But while Donaldson and Campbell failed to set the red carpet alight, Courtney Love and Rihanna did, although for all the wrong reasons. ' Where to start with Courtney?' says a horrified Glazin.

'Well, actually, from the beginning: whose idea was it to match your eye shadow with the dress and with the shoes? Good God, it looks awful. But that's Courtney's thing, ugly clothes work for her.'

MUST TRY HARDER 

Dreadful: Courtney Love needed a bra to make her pink dress work, while Rihanna would have looked better if she had found an outfit to wear

Step down! The skirt was nice but Rita Ora's sparkly crop top was more school disco than awards show - as were her awful platform shoes

Try harder: Alexa Chung was swamped by her dress while sandals would have improved Daisy Lowe's dress. Ellie Goulding looked like a bride

Love, at least, did bother to wear some clothes, unlike Rihanna who opted for an ill-fitting oversized tuxedo jacket and very little else. Despite a huge diamond necklace, all eyes were on the huge tattoo on her breastbone, while the opaque black tights seemed strange given all the flesh being flashed elsewhere.

'At first glance, I loved Rihanna's Stella McCartney get up, but the more I look the more I hate it,' says Glazin. 'And I cannot abide tights, especially dark tights, with sandals.'

Equally dreadful was Rita Ora, who managed to ruin her pretty black skirt by adding a crop top and pair of platforms that looked as if they had been hired for a school disco.

Others opting for fancy dress included Ellie Goulding, who appeared to have come as a bride, and Laura Haddock who was channeling the Regency period in a flowing silk and lace gown that came in a jarring shade of pistachio.

'Who told Laura Haddock this was a good look? It's frumpy and completely the wrong shape for her,' insists Glazin. 'Leave this kind of thing for Strictly Come Dancing contestants. Or a poor bridesmaid.'

Too much: Pretty print, pretty ruffle, pretty neckline - but too much together  Nicole Scherzinger.  Singer Ella Eyre had a similar problem

Oh dear: Naomi Campbell's frock was a dress of two halves - both ill-fitting - while Lily Donaldson's dress erred on the frumpy side

Not so clever colour: Katie Denham and Laura Haddock both suffered from bad colour and poor fit, while Lily Allen was crumpled in blue
