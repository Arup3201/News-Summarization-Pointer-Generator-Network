Team news

Southampton 

Ronald Koeman has no fresh injury concerns as he prepares his side for the visit of Leicester on Saturday.

Saints sit second in the Premier League table following a fine run of form, aided by the fact Koeman has been able to select from the majority of his squad for much of the season.

Only James Ward-Prowse (foot) and long-term absentee Jay Rodriguez (knee) are missing with Sadio Mane pushing for a start having come off the bench late on in the win at Hull last weekend.

Provisional squad: Forster, K Davis, Cropper, Clyne, Fonte, Gardos, Alderweireld, Bertrand, Targett, Schneiderlin, S Davis, Wanyama, Reed, Cork, Tadic, Yoshida, Mane, Long, Mayuka, Pelle, Gallagher.

Leicester 

Leonardo Ulloa is set to return for Leicester after being rested following a groin injury last week.

The striker was on the bench for the 1-0 home defeat to West Brom but is primed to return at Southampton.

Matt Upson (foot) is still out but Foxes boss Nigel Pearson is hopeful the defender, who is yet to play since joining in the summer, could return before Christmas.

Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Smith, Morgan, Moore, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Drinkwater, Hammond, James, King, Cambiasso, Albrighton, Mahrez, Knockaert, Vardy, Ulloa, Nugent, Schlupp, Wood, Powell.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Victor Wanyama has scored three goals in his last six Premier League appearances, having failed to net in his previous 26.

The last eight league meetings between Leicester and Southampton have been in the Championship, with the teams drawing both matches the last time they were together in the top flight in 2003-04.

Southampton have conceded just five league goals this season; fewer than any other team in England’s top four divisions.

Leicester City have failed to score in four of their last five Premier League matches.

The Saints have won five and lost none of their last seven Premier League matches at St Mary’s.

Southampton have conceded only three goals in their last nine on home soil and kept six clean sheets in that run.

If Southampton win this game without conceding they will have the same W-D-L and goals conceded record as Wigan did after 11 games in 2005-06. The Latics eventually faded to finish 10th.

The average finishing position for teams who have conceded five goals or fewer in their opening 10 games in the English top-flight is fourth.

Southampton only conceded four goals in their opening 10 Premier League games last season; they conceded 19 in their next 10, only managing one clean sheet.

Leicester have attempted just one direct-free kick shot this season, which was blocked.

Only nine opposition players have been booked facing Leicester this season, fewer than any other club.
