The Premier League big four were each given a kind home draw, which was made after Bradford saw off 10-man Leeds United with a 2-1 win at Valley Parade on Wednesday night.

Four other ties see Premier League opposition pitted against each other. 

Swansea City and Everton couldn't avoid matching, and will meet at the Liberty Stadium.

Crystal Palace's new manager Neil Warnock will look to orchestrate a win over Newcastle United, while Hull City face a trip to West Brom.

Gus Poyet admitted he was hungry for more after surviving Premier League relegation and making the League Cup final last year, and the Sunderland manager will have to see off Stoke City at home if he is to do so again. 

Elsewhere, Tottenham Hotspur are to face Nottingham Forest at White Hart Lane.

Leyton Orient and Burton Albion, having both seen off Premier League opposition in Aston Villa and QPR respectively, earned their own home ties. Orient will meet fellow League One club Sheffield United, while Albion face tougher opposition in Brighton & Hove Albion.
