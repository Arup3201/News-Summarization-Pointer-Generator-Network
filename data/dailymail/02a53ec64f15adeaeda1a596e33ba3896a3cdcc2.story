Disgraced celebrity chef Paula Deen has lost millions of dollar after high profile sponsors such as Target and Walmart severed ties with her, but now one company has announced it is sticking with the embattled star.

North Carolina-based Universal Furniture International has revealed that it will continue to market the ‘Paula Deen Home Collection’ furniture and home furnishings line.

Deen has been under fire since the revelation earlier this year of a legal deposition in which she admitted under oath to having used the N-word.

Good news for Paula as finally a sponsor announces that they're sticking with the embattled celebrity chef

Many companies have dropped Deen since the deposition became public including Target, Home Depot and The Food Network, pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk and her book publisher.

But on Wednesday Universal Furniture President & CEO Jeff Scheffer announced the company is going to stand by Deen after ‘a very difficult few weeks.’ 

‘Obviously, we feel terrible for Paula. The Paula we know – and the one I believe you have gotten to know – is not the same person as the one being portrayed in the media,’ Scheffer said in a letter sent to retailers.

‘Yes, she has acknowledged saying some hurtful things but she has also apologized, and we accept that. We also feel equally dismayed for those hurt by Paula’s remarks, which for certain do not represent our own diverse culture and beliefs at Universal.’

In the letter, Scheffer said after careful consideration, ‘we have decided to move forward with the Paula Deen brand and will continue to market her collections as the Paula Deen Home Collection from Universal Furniture.’

Scheffer said over the past few weeks, they heard from many retailers expressing ‘passionate support’ for Deen.

‘Several factors contributed to this decision – our belief that Paula is not the person portrayed by the media, our confidence that the brand will continue to have significant retail value, and most importantly the feedback that we have received from you, our customer,’ Scheffer said.

The announcement comes hot on the heels of another employee of Deen coming forward to make accusations about the celebrity chef.

Dora Charles, Deen’s longtime chef, has accused Deen of asking black kitchen workers to wear Aunt Jemima-style outfits and claims African American staff were also asked to ring a bell while hollering ‘come and get it’.

Charles also alleged that she was paid just $10 an hour and had to endure the TV chef using racist language around her.

In a statement to the New York Times, Deen’s spokesman denied asking anybody to dress like Aunt Jemima and denied using racist words in relation to her staff.

According to a Deen spokesman: ‘Fundamentally Dora’s complaint is not about race but about money.

‘It is about an employee that despite over 20 years of generosity feels that she still deserves yet even more financial support from Paula Deen.’

The claim is the latest blow to Deen, who is currently scrambling to salvage what is left of her $17m a year empire over the race row.

A message for her ex-sponsors: Hardcore Paula Deen fans are sending butter wrappers to the companies that dropped her as a protest

Die-hards Deen fans have taken to 
sending empty butter wrappers to her former sponsors as a protest at 
what they believe is her unfair treatment after admitting to using 
racial slurs.

The ‘We Support Paula Deen’ campaign is the brainchild of John Schmitt, a hotel night auditor in Indianapolis.

When a host of sponsors severed ties with Deen following her infamous ‘I is what I is’ interview on 
the Today show, he decided to do something to show his support for her.

‘In a lot of ways, she reminds me of my mom - this funny, gracious lady from a different era,’ he told CNN. ‘My mom probably used that word and she wasn’t a racist.’

He describes her sponsor's actions as a ‘betrayal’.

First he setup the 'We Support Paula Deen' Facebook page, which has attracted over 600,000 likes.

Then he and fellow supporters hit upon the idea of sending butter wrappers to her old sponsors as a form of protest - inspired by her favorite cooking ingredient.

‘The butter itself is Paula and these wrappers are void of butter, just like these companies are void of Paula,’ explained supporter Chris Ford.

Initially Schmitt wanted to mail actual butter sticks until he realized that would get very messy.

Schmitt and his fellow Deen fans don’t expect that the sponsors will take her back as a result of their efforts, but they wanted to do something to express their support for her and what they feel has been a witch hunt against their favorite celebrity chef.

‘I sent a butter wrapper knowing that the chuck-a-lucks down at the Food Network probably wouldn’t even open it,’ wrote Liz Vannah, a supporter from Connecticut, in a Facebook message.

‘But I felt compelled to do something to show that this kind of railroading, for whatever hidden-agenda-ed reason it happened, is not looked kindly upon by the consuming public.’

As well as the Facebook page there is also the ‘Butter for Paula’ website which features the slogan – ‘A corporation without Paula Deen is like a butter wrapper without butter’.

Joyce Dixon, from Claxton, Georgia, volunteers her time to helping run the campaign and believes Deen has been made a scapegoat.

‘It wasn’t about the N-word; it was about the extortion thing, about this one crazy employee,’ Dixon told CNN.

‘My interest is in Paula’s business. To me, it’s about a self-made woman. You have to ask yourself, “If she was a man, would this happen? If she was from the North would this happen?” And you know, I don’t think it would.’
