The geiger counter wristwatch worn by Sean Connery in the James Bond film Thunderball is to go under the hammer after it was bought for £25 at a car boot sale.

The whereabouts of the Breitling Top Time watch had been a mystery for years until it turned up at the sale.

The
prop - one of the many gadgets used by 007 during his 50 years 
on-screen - helped Bond locate stolen atomic weapons during underwater scenes in the 1965 film.

James Bond's Breitling Top Time watch, seen in Thunderball, was bought for £25 at a car boot sale following years of mystery as to its whereabouts

Now the watch is to be sold by 
Christie's in London with an estimated price of up to £60,000.

The
Top Time model by the Swiss firm was the first watch that audiences saw being adapted by Q's team of boffins in the series.

It was one of a 
number of items given to Bond by Q - played by Desmond Llewelyn - when 
he headed over to Nassau in the Bahamas to give him extra equipment.

One of the hands of
the watch shows the strength of radioactivity, to help him track down two Nato atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE.

The
basic watch was originally made by Breitling in 1962, then adapted by 
the James Bond art department. It was the only one produced for the 
movie.

It is thought that the watch was passed on by someone who worked at Pinewood Studios, where most of the film was made.

The watch helped Sean Connery's Bond to track down two Nato bombs stolen by SPECTRE in 1965's Thunderball

Christie's, which will sell the watch in a Pop Culture sale on June 26, had little further detail 
about the bargain hunter who found the watch, or where it was found.

A spokesman said: 'This is a great opportunity for collectors to acquire a unique piece of James Bond memorabilia.'

Bond's watches became an essential part of his armoury - as well as money-spinning merchandise for the franchise.

Thunderball was the only time a Breitling made an appearance in the films, while Hamilton and TAG Haeur made one-off appearances in Live and Let Die and The Living Daylights respectively.

But the classic Bond watch was decided in Ian Fleming's novels - the Rolex.

In 1962's Dr No, producer Cubby Broccoli had to lend Sean Connery his own Rolex as the company would not loan one for the production.

The Rolex Submariner became synonymous with Bond, appearing on his wrist in Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun, returning for one final outing in 1989's Licence to Kill.

Bond's watches were far more than accessories, with the timepieces adapted into gadgets by Q-Branch.

In Live and Let Die, Roger Moore used his Rolex to unzip the dress of agent Miss Caruso with the line: 'Sheer magnetism, darling', while it also doubled as a buzz-saw to help his escape death-by-sharks.

The Breitling in Thunderball helped him track down atomic bombs, while the production team opted for Seiko digital watches in the 1970s and 80s.

In The Spy Who Loved Me, Bond received ticker tape messages out of his watch, while in Moonraker his Seiko had built-in explosives and a detonator.

Other Seikos included GPS tracking devices and a TV screen for 007 to take video calls.

Bond's timepiece became a sleek Omega Seamaster in the 1990s, thought to be more modern than the Rolex. 

It first appeared in GoldenEye on Pierce Brosnan's wrist and is still worn by Daniel Craig, who became an ambassador for the brand.
