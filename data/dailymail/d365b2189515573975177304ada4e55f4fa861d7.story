For 21 years, Ryan Giggs has been ingrained in FIFA video game history. But now, as the 2015 version of the game was released into the public domain at midnight on Thursday, Giggs did not feature in the Manchester United squad for the first time ever.  

FIFA was first produced in July 1993, under the guise of 'FIFA International Soccer', and has been released every season since, but after Giggs' retirement at the end of last season, FIFA 15 features a Manchester United squad without their most capped player.

Hundreds queued overnight on Thursday to be some of the first to get their hands on this year's release. Tottenham's Eric Dier also appeared in GAME's Stratford store to play against some lucky youngsters prior to the game's launch at midnight.

This year's version of the popular video game also includes plenty of new features, as the game prides itself on improving year on year. 

1. Lionel Messi 93

2. Cristiano Ronaldo 92

3. Arjen Robben 90

4. Zlatan Ibrahimovic 90

5. Manuel Neuer 90

6. Andres Iniesta 89

7. Luis Suarez 89

8. Bastian Schweinsteiger 88

9. Franck Ribery 88

10. Eden Hazard 88 

Experts claim it is now much more lifelike - the corner flags bend if your player collides with it, the advertisement hoardings alongside the pitch have moving animations. 

Should you strike a ball against the woodwork from range, you may notice the bar shaking as play continues, or if your star striker misses a sitter early on, his willingness to shoot and accuracy thereafter will decrease with his lack of confidence. 

Most professional footballers love trying out the game - Manchester City players were pictured this week picking up their copies before general release - but this year is the first time Giggs will not be able to pick up a controller and play as himself.  

It has been a difficult start to the season for Manchester United - they currently sit 12th in the Premier League
