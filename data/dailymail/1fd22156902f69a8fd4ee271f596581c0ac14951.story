It's not uncommon to fork out $400 for a pair of luxury sunglasses, and now, it has been revealed why.

Luxottica, a 'little-known but very big Italian company' appears to have gained total domination over the world's eyewear production; making prescription frames and sunglasses for nearly every designer brand, from Prada and Chanel, to Ralph Lauren and Versace.

Last night, CBS‘ 60 Minutes revealed that half a billion people own a pair of Luxottica-made glasses, a fact that has resulted in an eyewear market monopoly.

Market monopoly: Luxottica, a 'little-known but very big Italian company' appears to have gained total domination over the world's eyewear production

In the segment, reporter Lesley Stahl
 interviews Luxottica CEO Andrea Guerra, who revealed his company also 
owns Ray-Ban, which they 'refurbished' from a $29 per pair gas station 
brand into the top-selling sunglasses in the world, as well as Oakley, 
and Oliver Peoples.

In 
addition to making the glasses, Luxottica also owns nearly every major 
retail outlet that sells eyewear, including prescription eyewear chains 
LensCrafters and Pearl Vision. It also runs Target Optical and Sears 
Optical.

Luxottica 
also owns Sunglass Hut - the world's largest sunglass chain. As well as 
EyeMed, the second-largest vision care insurance plan in the U.S.

What started as a small tool shop in 
the Italian alps has turned into a compnay that last year made 65million
 pairs of frames, bringing in $8billion.

Brett Arends, a
 columnist for SmartMoney.com, said: 'One company has excessive 
dominance in the [eyewear] market. The appearance of variety is an 
optical illusion.

'Oakley was a big competitor,' he continued. 'Then they had a fight with Luxottica, a dispute about pricing, so Luxottica basically said, "We're dropping you from our stores". [Oakley's] stock price collapsed. How is Oakley going to reach their consumer if they can't get their glasses into Sunglass Hut?'

Having it all: Luxottica also makes Tiffany & Co glasses -  only Walmart, Warby Parker and Cosco are its main competitors

Luxottica bought Oakley in 2007. As Ms Stahl said to Mr Guerra, 'Oakley tried to compete, they lost, so Luxottica bought them.'

Mr Guerra contends that there are 'lots of things' his company doesn’t own - Walmart, Warby Parker and Cosco are its main competitors - but it continues to hold its competitors hostage, said Ms Stahl.

Mr Arends explained: 'If
 you make glasses you want to be in their stores. If you have a store 
you want to sell their glasses. So Luxottica can set its prices as high 
as it wants and other people have to follow in it's wake.'

Too expensive? The lack of competition results in 'routinely pricing glasses at $200 or more that cost less than $30 to make'

Total domination: Luxottica also owns Sunglass Hut - the world's largest sunglass chain. As well as EyeMed, the second-largest vision care insurance plan in the U.S.

This lack of competition results in routinely pricing glasses at $200 or more that cost less than $30 to make, he added.

Mr Guerra's explanation? 'Everything is worth what people are ready to pay'.
