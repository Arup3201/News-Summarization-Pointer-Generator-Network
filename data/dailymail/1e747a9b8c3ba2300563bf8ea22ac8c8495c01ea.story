A soldier who died following an SAS training exercise in the Brecon Beacons suffered multiple organ failure, an inquest heard today.

Corporal James Dunsby died in hospital 17 days after collapsing on South Wales’s highest mountain, Pen Y Fan, on one of the hottest days of the year.

Aberdare Cororner’s Court was told that the 31-year-old was one of six soldiers who collapsed during the military exercise on July 13.

Fellow reservists Edward John Maher and Craig John Roberts also died after falling ill during training exercise for the SAS’s tough selection process.

The armed forces have long used the Brecon Beacons for exercises as its rugged terrain and harsh conditions provide ideal preparation for combat situations.

It is thought the reservists were carrying out an exercise known as the 'Fan Dance' - which involves marching up 886-metre high Pen Y Fan and down the other side carrying a weighted pack and rifle, before doing the route in reverse, in a set time.

North Walian and teacher Lance Corporal Roberts was pronounced dead on the mountainside, while Lance Corporal Maher and Cpl Dunsby were taken to hospital.

L/Cpl Maher died three hours later in Merthyr Tydfil’s Prince Charles Hospital, while Cpl Dunsby remained in critical condition.

The political science graduate was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, which has the the largest single-floor critical care unit in the world and is home to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine.

Despite the efforts of doctors and the hospital’s state-of-the-art facilities, Cpl Dunsby was pronounced dead 17 days later on July 30.

During the opening of Cpl Dunsby's inquest today, Coroner Louise Hunt said results of a post-mortem examination gave the official cause of death as 'multiple organ failure'.

Ms Hunt said further tests needed to be carried out and stressed the purpose of the inquest was 'not to proportion blame'.

She promised investigations would be conducted thoroughly, with medical reports, witnesses testimonies and video footage playing a key role.

She added: 'It’s important that the full circumstances are addressed to the families so they can understand what happened to their loved ones.'

Proceedings were adjourned to September 3 when an interim inquest hearing will take place.

It is expected this will give an update on Dyfed Powys Police’s investigation into the deaths.

The date for a full inquest is not yet known, but Ms Hunt said all three cases should be heard together.

The men became ill close to Pen y Fan, which at 2,900 feet is the highest mountain in South Wales. Army chiefs say the rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for war
