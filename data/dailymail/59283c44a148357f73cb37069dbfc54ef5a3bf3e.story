Facebook has bought a fitness tracking app that can tell users exactly where they walked, and how many calories they burnt.

Facebook announced the deal today, but did not reveal how much it paid for ProtoGeo Oy, the 2-year-old Helsinki company that makes the Moves app.

It is the latest in a spree of acquisitions for Facebook which have included WhatsApp and virtual reality headset maker Oculus.

The Moves app allows users to track how far they walk each day, and exactly how many calories they burn - as well as showing them exactly where they went.

The app uses a smartphone's built-in sensors to track a person's physical activity, recognizing movements such as walking, cycling and running.

The free Moves app has been downloaded more than 4 million times for iPhone and Android phones, according to ProtoGeo.

The app can use GPS, or the motion sensor built into Apple's latest iPhone 5S handset.

The move gives the social networking company an entry into the nascent market for fitness and health monitoring technology.

Facebook did not disclose the price it paid for ProtoGeo Oy, the 2-year-old Helsinki company that makes the Moves app.

A Facebook spokesman said the price for ProtoGeo, which has fewer than 10 employees, was not anywhere near what the company had paid for other higher-profile acquisitions recently.

Facebook has begun 2014 by going on a shopping spree, paying $19 billion for mobile messaging service WhatsApp in February and $2.3 billion for virtual reality headset maker Oculus VR a couple of weeks later.

The app maker took to its blog to announce the deal, and assured custiomers their data would not be gioven to Facebook.

'For those of you that use the Moves app â€“ the Moves experience will continue to operate as a standalone app, and there are no plans to change that or commingle data with Facebook,' it said.

Fitness tracking is attracting the attention of large and small technology companies, with companies such as Fitbit and Jawbone selling electronic bracelets that measure the wearer's activities.

In March, Google Inc announced a special version of its Android operating system aimed at smartwatches and other types of wearable computers.

The Android Wear project will enable devices that can be outfitted with a variety of sensors to track a user's heart rate or measure the distance jogged, Google said.

With the Moves app, Facebook can enter the market without developing its own wearable computing hardware.

The app can track walking, running and cycling

The app uses a smartphone's built-in sensors to track a person's physical activity, recognizing movements such as walking, cycling and running.

Facebook said Moves, which would continue to operate as a separate app, fit into its recent strategy of offering a variety of standalone mobile apps, such as Instagram for photo-sharing, Facebook Messenger for messaging and WhatsApp.

Sampo Karjalainen, whose official title is 'designer CEO' of ProtoGeo, began working at Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters last week, the Facebook spokesman said.

The free Moves app has been downloaded more than 4 million times for iPhone and Android phones, according to ProtoGeo.
