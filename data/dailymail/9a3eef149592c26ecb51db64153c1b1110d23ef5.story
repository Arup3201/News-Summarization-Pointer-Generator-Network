'Cracking innovation': Peppersmith co-founders Dan Shrimpton, left, and Mike Stevens are behind the sweets that are good for you

A range of sweets that are good for children's teeth is set to reach the shops this week.

The sugar-free treats called Tingz contain xylitol – a naturally occurring sweetener that is said to reduce plaque and tooth decay.

Available in strawberry and vanilla and orange and mandarin flavours, the products have been accredited by the British Dental Health Foundation.

They are made by Peppersmith, which sells sugar-free mints and gum to adults, and will be launched at this week’s IFE food
and drink exhibition in London, before being rolled out to retailers 
including Ocado and Whole Foods Market.

Peppersmith co-founder Dan Shrimpton 
told trade magazine The Grocer yesterday: 'The concept of great tasting 
sweets that are good for you is a bit of a shock but once retailers have
seen and tasted them, they have appreciated that Tingz is a cracking 
piece of innovation. '

Mr Shrimpton said that recent investment had given Peppersmith the resources to make Tingz its biggest-ever launch.

Marketing activity would be focused on education and trial and would include consumer PT alongside sampling.

Last December, Peppersmith claimed sales of its gum and minted had rocketed following newspaper articles extolling the virtues of natural sweetener xylitol.

The company said the reaction of consumers had been phenomenal, with webshop sales up 2,000% and orders on Amazon up 8,000%.

Health food chain Holland & Barrett reported that sales of some xylitol products were up 350% on the same period last year.
