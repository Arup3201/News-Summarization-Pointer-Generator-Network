Lucky man, Louis van Gaal. Very lucky, in fact. At this point last season, the heat on David Moyes was being turned up mercilessly, so why is his successor escaping?

Think about it: United have exactly the same points (37) from the same number of games (21); they have scored one goal fewer in the Barclays Premier League than the 35 Moyes’s side had managed, even after spending more than £150million last summer.

But it goes deeper than statistics.

Both the Manchester United fans and players believe in Louis van Gaal thanks to his pedigree in the game

Moyes was preparing for a Capital One Cup semi-final against Sunderland and had the Champions League last 16 on his horizon; Van Gaal has had no Europe and overseen one of the most embarrassing defeats in United history.

Yet the 4-0 drubbing they suffered at the hands of MK Dons in August was quickly forgotten and when United failed to have a shot on target against Southampton last weekend, again there was no major inquest.

Watching how that contest unfolded, I couldn’t help thinking back to a similar match under Moyes, particularly when Van Gaal put Marouane Fellaini up front and started playing long but took off the players who would provide the best crosses — Luke Shaw and Angel di Maria.

The game in question was against Fulham. United drew 2-2 and Moyes argued afterwards that his side were unlucky because they had put in 81 crosses.

No United fans had sympathy with him, nor did his players. Rio Ferdinand, for one, was openly critical about that approach in his book.

That wouldn’t happen now and there is a reason — just as there is a reason why Van Gaal is not having his performance — or the performances of his team — scrutinised to the level that Moyes experienced 12 months ago.

It comes down to one word: belief.

David Moyes had the weight of the world on his shoulders when Fulham pulled off a draw at Old Trafford

Van Gaal strode into Old Trafford after leading Holland to third place in the World Cup, exuding authority, certainty and, above all, with a c.v. that included league titles in Germany, Spain and his home country, not to mention a Champions League trophy. Do not underestimate what that is worth to players and supporters.

I remember an incident not long after Gerard Houllier had become sole manager of Liverpool. It was January 1999 and we had been drawn against United in the FA Cup but had not won at Old Trafford since 1990.

Michael Owen put us ahead early on and we were within minutes of seeing out the tie but were hit with two sucker punches in the last few minutes. The dressing room afterwards was like a morgue. The goals had left us feeling hollow but then we heard Houllier speaking on television.

Gerard Houllier (centre) said he knew Liverpool would win at Old Trafford one day following the defeat in 1999

‘You know what,’ he said. ‘We have lost but, I guarantee, we will win here one day.’

Suddenly you start thinking to yourself, ‘he really believes this’.

Houllier had been part of France’s technical committee when they won the World Cup six months earlier. His words, then, carried extra significance and they clearly worked. We lost only one of our next six trips, winning three.

Something similar happened with Rafa Benitez.

Before the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea in 2005, his message could not have been more emphatic. ‘We will win,’ he told us. There was no wavering. He arrived with two La Liga titles and a UEFA Cup, so we did not doubt him.

But it should not be forgotten that both Houllier and Benitez had some awful results in their first seasons — Houllier was dumped out of Europe by Celta Vigo, Benitez was beaten in the FA Cup by Burnley — yet, like Van Gaal, they were never subjected to an intense focus.

Rafa Benitez was convinced that Liverpool would beat Chelsea in the 2005 Champions League semi-final

Benitez's belief was proved to be correct as Liverpool did win to progress into the Champions League final

There is an underlying problem for British managers there. I wrote last season how we needed Moyes to succeed at United, for Brendan Rodgers to flourish with Liverpool and for Roy Hodgson to do well with England to show that our coaches could compete at the top level.

That is where the swagger Van Gaal possesses comes from; that is why he can speak as he did  in a press conference and be so blunt about Radamel Falcao. What reaction would there have been to Moyes saying one of the best strikers in the world has to prove himself?

I love watching Van Gaal in front of the cameras every week; I love how he can be so dismissive if he doesn’t like a question and find his reactions very funny.

Van Gaal is known as a winner and that helps him even when his side are under-performing 

Just like Sir Alex Ferguson, there is meaning to every word he puts out each Friday afternoon.

People tipped United to win the title at the start of the season purely because of Van Gaal and I’m convinced that, had they beaten Southampton, he would have started talking up their credentials, especially with Manchester City dropping points at Everton.

A victory would have left them nine points behind Chelsea but many players in the dressing room, along with countless supporters, would have believed him. Why? He is Van Gaal and has the record to back it up, particularly in big games.

Having a name for winning is priceless. Things clearly aren’t working as well as Van Gaal would want.

As the injuries that United have suffered shows, there have been issues with regard to his training methods and his adapting to the Premier League.

He has also been lucky that Liverpool and Arsenal, who disappeared over the horizon when Moyes struggled, have not been more of a threat. This year, he has capitalised, beating both clubs, as well as drawing with Chelsea.

Clearly he has had some fortune but not with his reputation. And that is why, no matter how underwhelming United have been, they will believe at Old Trafford Van Gaal has them heading back to the Champions League.

Stones had a let-off but all bosses hate taking risks

John Stones got off lightly during Everton’s FA Cup replay against West Ham on Tuesday.

The young England defender took on three players on the edge of his own penalty area and nearly cost his side a goal. I expressed that view on Twitter and the reaction I got was colourful, to say the least, but the main responses were that ‘you would have hoofed it!’, I was ‘a typical English dinosaur’ and, my favourite, that I was nothing but ‘a yard dog’.

John Stones was criticised by Jamie Carragher on Twitter for taking on three players on the edge of his box

That last term never fails to bring a smile to my face. My Dad used it to refer to the old Coventry defender Brian Kilcline or Manchester United’s Graeme Hogg when I was a kid. Those two did not mess around!

On a serious note, we have an idea that foreign coaches encourage this type of game, dribbling the ball out from the back. It is nonsense. Jose Mourinho bombed out David Luiz for taking chances at the back. Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez would have been furious if I, or anyone else, had tried that.

Brian Kilcline (left) and Graeme Hogg (right) were two defenders who did not mess about

It was the same with England. Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello would not have stood for that. Another thing all those coaches do is select a target man for their teams — whether it be Emile Heskey, Peter Crouch, Didier Drogba or Diego Costa. Isn’t that typically British?

We all want technically gifted players, for them to be brave, to show and receive the ball.

John Stones does that really well but no manager in world football wants a defender who dribbles in his own box — whether they are from Barnsley or Brazil.

This week I’m looking forward to seeing if the old Fernando Torres is back... 

The Madrid derby again made for compelling viewing on Thursday and the story of Torres scoring twice could not have been more romantic for Atletico fans.

Is Diego Simeone the man to coax Torres back to the form he showed when he played for Liverpool?

Certainly there were flashes of his best in the Bernabeu, not least in the emphatic finish for Atletico’s opener.

Fernando Torres scored twice for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey

I started thinking about how he celebrated in front of the Real Madrid supporters when we beat them 4-0 at Anfield in the Champions League back in 2009.

Torres was at his peak then and it has been a sad football story to see how things have gone for him since.

Now he is back at his first club, it could be that his career is going to finish on a high.

There is a lot for Atletico to play for this season — La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa del Rey — and if Simeone can get Torres back to somewhere near his most clinical, they will have an excellent striker.
