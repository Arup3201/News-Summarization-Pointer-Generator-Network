US Navy SEALs 'destroyed everything' with the failed attempt to rescue Al-Qaeda hostages just a day before one of them was due to be released, a charity said.

South African teacher Pierre Korkie and British-born photojournalist Luke Somers were shot by militants during the raid.

But the project director of a charity working with Mr Korkie said would have been freed by the terrorists today. 

The Navy SEALs landed by helicopter six miles from the Al-Qaeda compound where the hostages were being held.

Speaking anonymously to the BBC, senior officials said 40 special forces soldiers, backed by Yemeni troops, advanced to within 100m of the site, but they were spotted by a militant.

The terrorist was briefly seen running into the compound, which is likely to be when the hostages were shot. Mr Korkie died on a helicopter and Mr Somers died on board a US navy ship.

Gift of the Givers' Yemen project director Anas Hamati said: 'Pierre Korkie was very sick - he had a hernia.'

Mr Hamati added that mediators had been working on an 'arrangement to take him out' and that his passport was ready.

'In that time, the attack happened by US special forces in Yemen and that has destroyed everything.'

Mr Korkie's wife Yolande said she was 'devastated' to learn of her husband's death and that she had been preparing to leave South Africa for Istanbul  to meet her husband's planned flight from Yemen.

A spokesman for the family said today: 'Yolande is extremely distressed, as you can imagine. She had built up hope that Pierre was coming home after so many months of waiting, and now is coming to terms with the fact that he is never coming home. 

'She does not hold anyone to blame, she has never even said a bad word about Al Qaeda, she is an extremely strong woman, guided by her faith.'

Meanwhile, South Africa's main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), called on the government to demand an explanation from Washington over the timing.

Yolande Korkie, pictured, said Al-Qaeda had agreed to release her husband  from the Yemeni hideout after months of negotiations aided by South African charity Gift of the Givers and a local tribe

Stevens Mokgalapa, the shadow foreign minister, said: 'The DA believes that the South African government must urgently engage with American representatives to get to the bottom of the circumstances that led to Mr Korkie's death, reportedly a day before his captors intended to release him.' 

The mother-of-two was held with her husband for seven months before her release in January, after South African charity Gift of the Givers convinced Al Qaeda the couple were not American.

Ms Korkie had spent the last 11 months campaigning for his freedom which was agonisingly close to fruition after the Muslim charity and local tribal leaders liaised with the jihadists.

Yesterday, as she and her children were being comforted at home by family, she thanked those who had secured her freedom and risked their own lives on behalf of her husband.

Just hours before Gift of the Givers boss Dr Imtiaz Sooliman briefed reporters after Pierre was gunned down Ms Korkie had texted him that 'the waiting is almost over' for his release. 

She later wrote: 'Please accept our deep appreciation for your immeasurable commitment ... and the tribes. I am too emotional to speak to Anas [the charity field worker who negotiated with Al Qaeda for her and her husband's freedom] right now.

'But remind him of my words to him in Sana: if anything happens, it is NOT his fault. And neither your or the tribe's fault.' 

Last night a spokesman for the family said: 'Teaching was Pierre's life. His heart took him to Yemen. He loved teaching the poor.'

Dr Sooliman told MailOnline he'd told Mrs Korkie about a premonition he'd had that American forces might attack the compound where her husband  was being held.

They were making last-minute arrangements for his liberation in a late-night conversation, even as the audacious rescue attempt was under way.

'We were speaking on the phone after midnight and I said to Yolande, 'if the Americans attack to release the hostages, the danger is Pierre can get killed,' Dr Sooliman told MailOnline.

'She accepted that, she knew there was a real risk of that happening following the threat by Al Qaeda to execute an American. 

'She is an incredibly strong woman, she has got stronger every day that we have been working on this. She is calm, she has faith and very resolute. 

'We have been handling the negotiations, but she has been informed of every detail, every step of the way.'

He added: 'The psychological and emotional devastation to Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was about to be released by al Qaida.

'You can't blame anybody for this. You can't accuse or blame them [US forces]. It's just unfortunate that it happened.'

There had been just three sightings of Mr Korkie, who is deaf, since he was captured 18 months ago and there were serious concerns for his fading health.

The family had lived in Yemen for four years before Mr and Mrs Korkie were snatched off the street outside their hotel in May last year as they were preparing to fly home for the funeral of Mr Korkie's father.

The children returned home without their parents and were cared for by family until their mother's release seven months later.

In an interview recorded on the first anniversary of his capture, Mrs Korkie, a therapist who specialises in using horses as healing aides, revealed how she and the children slept in her husband's t-shirts every night and refused to eat his favourite food until his return.

British-born photo-journalist Luke Somers, 33, was also killed by Al-Qaeda terrorists during the raid 

Mr Somers was kidnapped in September 2013 from Yemen's capital Sana'a (shown in the map above)

'He continues to live in the most difficult circumstances,' she said.

'Time in captivity does not go by in hours, it goes by minute to minute. The world as he knows it has stopped. Surviving becomes the only reality.'

Mr Korkie was well-known and liked in the family's small, conservative Afrikaner home town of Bloemfontein, where he was a teacher at the local school and one-time athletics coach to its most famous daughter, Olympic running sensation Zola Budd.

Last night, Ms Budd declined to comment on her old friend's death, but her agent said she was 'devastated by the news'.

Dr Sooliman revealed that as part of the release plan, Mrs Korkie had written a letter to her husband which was to be given to him by the Abyan tribal leaders to whom Al Qaeda had agreed to hand him over.

In the note, written in Afrikaans, she explained that he could trust the men who were helping to get him home in time for Christmas.

The architects of 9/11 had even agreed to waive their US $3million ransom for Mr Korkie when they finally confirmed he would be freed three weeks ago.

The charity decided to approach the tribal leaders for their assistance after contact with Al Qaeda broke down after Mr Korkie's family had failed to raise the ransom the group had demanded.

Mr Korkie's body is held by the US forces. The South African government will liaise with military officials and the Yemeni government for the repatriation of his remains, Nelson Kgwete, a spokesman for the South African government said.
