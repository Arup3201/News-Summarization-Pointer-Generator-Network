Danish side FC Midtjylland have failed with a bid for Manchester United goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard.

Midtjylland, who are part-owned by Brentford chairman Matthew Benham, opened talks with United last week about a deal for the Denmark international but could not find common a ground over the fee.

Lindegaard is also understood to be looking for a move to a bigger club.

Danish side FC Midtjylland have failed with a bid for the 30-year-old Danish stopper

Molde have shown an interest in the 30-year-old.

His advisers have been in England to establish what his alternatives are with United keen to move him on following the signing of Victor Valdes on an 18-month contract.

Sam Johnstone has joined Preston North End on loan and the club will listen to offers for Ben Amos also.

Midtjylland have since announced the signing of Sweden goalkeeper John Dahlin.
