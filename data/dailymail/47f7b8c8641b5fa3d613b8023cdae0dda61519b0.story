Planning minister Nick Boles will use a speech today to warn homes need to be built on green sites or else only the rich will be able to afford homes

Britain will be dragged back to the 19th century when home ownership was the preserve of the wealthiest unless homes are built on untouched greenfield land, the planning minister warns.

Nick Boles will dramatically raise the stakes over the housing crisis, saying the Government has a ‘moral’ duty to force councils to find land for development to defend Margaret Thatcher’s dream of a ‘property owning democracy’.

And he has warned grandparents who oppose new housebuilding risk 'propping up their kids and their grandkids' who cannot afford to buy their home own.

He has unveiled plans to bribe local communities with hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash to accept new house building.

In future, neighbourhood groups who back plans for estates will be handed money to build community centres, save a pub or re-roof the local church.

Mr Boles will also deliver a threat to town hall chiefs, warning those who refuse to find land to build on will be overruled.

Ministers have given council bosses until March to come up with land to build 270,000 homes for each of the next five years.

Mr Boles has previously sparked controversy by revealing that greenfield land equal to the area of London will have to be built on to solve the housing shortage. In a speech in London to the leading centre-right think tank Policy Exchange, which Mr Boles set up, he said: ‘We can turn a blind eye while Margaret Thatcher’s dream of a property-owning democracy shrivels.

‘We can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends.

‘We can shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th century: a privilege, the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents.

‘Or we can accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land and resolve that we will make these decisions locally.’

In a warning shot at green groups and rural campaigners who have opposed the Government’s liberalisation of planning laws, Mr Boles added ‘we simply can’t squeeze much more out of brownfield sites’ which have been built on before.

Mr Boles will vow to protect the greenbelt and areas of outstanding natural beauty. 

But he said people who have been lucky enough to buy a home should not oppose extra houses for the next generation.

People had to recognise that 'either 
they will spend their retirement propping up their kids and their 
grandkids, or they can accept more development so their grandkids don’t 
have the problem,' he told the Daily Telegraph.

'I genuinely think that the single biggest way in 
which we are failing to deliver social justice in this country at the 
moment is unaffordable housing – more than schools, more than jobs, more
than benefits,' he said.

Home ownership in England fell for the first time in 60 years during 2011 from 68 per cent to 63 per cent.

Mr Boles will starkly detail the way price rises have excluded millions from the housing market over the past 30 years.

If the price of food had risen at the same rate as housing over the past 30 years, a supermarket chicken would now cost £47 and a jar of instant coffee £20. He will say: ‘No aspiration is more deeply embedded in the British psyche than the desire to own your own home.

‘But the prospect of doing so has been slipping ever further out of the reach of millions of hard-working people.

‘This is a result of our decades-long failure to build enough houses. And the root cause of this is our decades-long refusal to release enough land for development.’

The policy would allow neighbourhood groups, along with parish councils, to get together and approve development plans to build homes. Local people would be asked to back them in a referendum.

Those communities would then receive a slice of a fund called the Community Infrastructure Levy to spend on local improvements – worth around £500,000 to a group of local residents.

Mr Boles will say: ‘This Government is determined to persuade communities to accept more house-building by giving them a tangible share of the benefits it brings.’

But councils who fail to help out will be overruled using the Government’s National Policy Planning Framework.

Mr Boles will say: ‘They must identify immediately developable sites sufficient to supply all of the new homes that are needed over the next five years.

‘Some are dragging their feet. And a few are looking for ways to evade their responsibilities. That is not acceptable. Councils which do not produce credible plans to meet local housing need will find that the presumption in favour of sustainable development will trump local decisions.

‘The Government will not support those local councils who abdicate their responsibility to meet their fair share of our common housing needs.’

Mr Boles will also take aim at Labour, saying the last government only built 147,000 new homes a year while running an open-door immigration policy which helped increase the population of the UK by 3.8million between 2001 and 2011.
