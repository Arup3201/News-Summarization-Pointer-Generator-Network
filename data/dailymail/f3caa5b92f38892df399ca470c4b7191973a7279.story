Britain's biggest water company wants to impose a £29 surcharge on millions of customers.

Thames Water has made profits of £1.7billion over the last five years on the back of a succession of inflation-busting increases in bills.

At the same time it has paid dividends of some £1.4billion to its private owners, including investment funds owned by the governments of China and Abu Dhabi.

Thames Water is expected to pay about £4million pounds for the damage done in Herne Hill when a three foot wide water main burst

But it now wants its 14million customers to dig deep into their pockets yet again to pay the one-off surcharge because of a raft of extra costs it faces.

The proposal was immediately condemned by the official customer body, which called on the industry regulator, Ofwat, to block it.

Thames Water justified the surcharge by saying it had suffered a bigger than expected drop in income because of customer bad debt.

There had also been a £66million bill for maintaining thousands of miles of private household sewers, it said.

The company is also having to find millions of pounds to buy land for the Thames Tideway Tunnel – a vast super-sewer for London.

Last week dozens of businesses and homes were flooded in south London after a three foot wide water main burst near Herne Hill station, with parts of the suburb submerged under a metre-and-a-half of water on Wednesday.

Thames Water and its insurers are expected to pick up a bill of around £4million for the damage.

Critics say the company would have more than enough money to cover all these costs if it had not given away so much in dividends.

Sir Tony Redmond, chairman of the Consumer Council for Water in the South East, said: ‘Many other water companies absorbed the costs that Thames say they are facing – and without applying for a further price increase. Thames Water should do the same.

‘Our research shows one in seven customers say they can’t afford their water bill. Thames Water’s price hike will add to the problem.’ 

The company already plans to put up bills by 1.4per cent above RPI inflation in April, which will raise the annual figure from £354 to around £370.

With the new surcharge, the figure would rise to almost £400.

Water bills are set to rise next year - with or without an extra charge from Thames Water

Thames Water has gone through several foreign hands since privatisation in 1989. Since being sold to a consortium headed by the Australian bank Macquarie, in 2006/07, it has been weighed down with billions of pounds of debt, and massive interest payments.

This tactic has played a part in allowing the firm to pay  zero corporation tax on its huge profits.

A recent study by the Centre Forum think-tank condemned the way water companies have been allowed to give billions of pounds in dividends to largely private investors.

It called on the government to limit the stellar dividends.

Thames Water provides some eight million homes with water and 14 million with sewerage services.

Its prices – as with all water companies – are set on a five-year cycle with figures agreed by Ofwat.

Thames insists this regime allows it to come back and argue for a surcharge to cover unusual costs.

Chief financial officer Stuart Siddall said: ‘These significant costs could not be quantified at the beginning of the current pricing period; their scale is unique to Thames Water’s operations, project commitments and catchment area.’ 

The company would prefer the £29 surcharge to be spread over several years to ‘avoid a spike in bills for our customers’, he said.

The decision on whether to allow the surcharge will be made by Ofwat. Chief executive Regina Finn said: ‘We have made it clear to companies we expect them to talk to their customers, listen to them and take account of their customers’ views.’
