Former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela made sure David Moyes’ reign at Anoeta started in style scoring a hat-trick in Real Sociedad’s 3-0 win over Elche.

Despite the best efforts of fussy referee Carlos Velasco, Moyes picked up his first win and it was largely thanks to the Mexican international who scored twice in the first half and then again after the break to help Real Sociedad move away from the La Liga drop zone.

Vela had the ball in the net inside three minutes when Sergio Canales tricked his way down the right and rolled the ball into Carlos Martinez’ path. The right back crossed to Real Sociedad’s leading scoring and he scored with a powerful header.

Real Sociedad: Zubikarai, Martínez, Elustondo, Ansotegi, De la Bella, Bergara, Granero, Vela (Castro, 87), Xabi Prieto, Canales (Rubén Pardo, 71), Agirretxe (Finnbogason, 8)

Goals scored:  Vela 3, 32, 53

One of the things that Moyes will need to get used to in La Liga is the tendency for some referees to penalise the slightest physical contact.

In recent years match officials’ style has change and become closer to that of Premier League referees but Velasco is old-school and frustrated Moyes by whistling every Real challenge in the early part of the game.

Moyes has demanded his players be more physical but both Canales and Jon Ansotegi went into the book for what looked like harmless challenges.

Real Sociedad’s football was bright though with Canales linking well with the excellent Vela and shooting over as the home side went for the second goal.

Striker Imanol Agirretxe pulled up with a hamstring injury and had to be replaced by Alfred Finnbogason but it did nothing to knock La Real out of their stride and Vela soon had the second. He ran onto a perfectly weighted pass from skipper Xabi Prieto and sprinted between Elche’s two central defenders to score past Przemysław Tyton.

Elche threatened through their Brazilian striker Jonathas but he squandered two chances in the first 45 minutes and Real Sociedad goalkeeper Eñaut Zubikarai saved well from Denis Suarez.

Vela was on form though and he played Canales in with a brilliant pass only for the former Real Madrid forward’s cross to be blocked. Vela almost scored at the start of the second half but Tyton turned his shot away for a corner. Vela has a superb record against Elche who came into the game never having won at Anoeta and having lost this fixture 4-0 last season.

The Mexican has the quality to lead Real up the table and his third goal was the pick of the three burying a shot in the far corner through through the legs of Elche defender David Lomban.

Vela is a reminder of why Real Sociedad were playing Champions League football last season and when he was hauled down by Victor Rodriguez Velasco pulled out perhaps his first justifiable card of the night.

He is not the only jewel in the squad Moyes has inherited. Ruben Pardo came on for Canales in the last 20 minutes and orchestrated some of the best football of the night. The Spain under-21 international has lost his way of late but Moyes will be encouraged by this cameo.

He will also be delighted with a second clean sheet from his players. If that and the form of Vela, who went off to a standing ovation four minutes from time, keeps up then Real will soon be back at the right end of the table.
