Zlatan Ibrahimovic got himself on the scoresheet as PSG advanced to the last 32 of the French Cup with a comfortable victory against Montpellier on Monday night.

On a poor playing surface at Altrad Stadium the French champions turned on the style after a tight first half as Clement Chantome opened the scoring in the 63rd minute.

The midfielder, making just his second start of the season, rolled the ball into an open net after after the instrumental Ibrahimovic combined with Marquinos before squaring to Chantome.

Ibrahimovic added a second 15 minutes later to effectively kill the tie as the Sweden international stooped to head home Javier Pastore's cross from close range.

The Argentina international picked Ibrahimovic out superbly for the striker to net his 16th goal of the season in all competitions.

Lucas Moura added extra gloss to the win in the first minute of injury time as he raced clear down the right flank before unleashing a lethal finish across Montpellier goalkeeper Jonathan Ligali.

Montpellier's best chance fell to Lucas Barrios but the former Dortmund striker hit a tame effort straight at PSG goalkeeper Nicolas Douchez 10 minutes into the second half.

It served as a warning for PSG who moved through the gears in the final half-an-hour to set up a last-16 clash with Bordeaux with a place in the quarter-final up for grabs.
