Bombshell details of salacious messages sent by a top Tory official on a gay dating service, referring to a sex party funded by Conservative MPs’ expenses, were revealed last night.

Messages the official exchanged with another man on Grindr, a gay dating app, refer to ‘cute boys’, ‘orgy’, ‘gay party’, ‘hottie MPs’ and ‘all in one bed’ said to be ‘on offer’ in a luxury hotel suite hired for Tory researchers at the party’s annual conference in Manchester.

The messages name two top Tory MPs: one of the most senior Government Ministers and an MP tipped as a future Party leader.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the exchanges involved Tory official Iain Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for  by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses.

Insiders say there was near panic at 10 Downing Street when the Grindr messages were reported to David Cameron last month.

He ordered an urgent investigation, which led to Mr Corby’s departure in an attempt to limit the damage.

The shocking disclosures came as:

It adds to a fevered atmosphere at Westminster, with wild, and for the most part, anonymous, claims that young gay researchers are bullied – or even drugged – into accepting sexual advances from MPs and other senior political  figures under the threat of missing out on political careers.

The ‘sex party’ on MPs’ expenses at Manchester’s Light ApartHotel, where rooms cost up to £2,500 a night, was first revealed by The Mail on Sunday last week. At that stage, this newspaper faced legal restrictions over the amount of detail that could be reported.

Today we can reveal full details of the Tory PRU chief at the centre of the row – and of how claims that the PRU scandal was covered up for years forced No 10 to act. 

The body responsible for MPs’ expenses and pay, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), is now investigating the hotel ‘sex party’.

An IPSA source expressed ‘deep worry’ at the allegations. IPSA has good reason to be concerned: the event was funded by money claimed from it by MPs.

Furthermore, it could have been a breach of IPSA rules to pay for the PRU accommodation at the Light ApartHotel, regardless of what went on there. 

IPSA rules state ‘staffing expenditure may not be claimed for any party political activity.’ Nor can MPs claim expenses for ‘attendance at political party conferences’.

The PRU is a team of 20, mainly young 
male and female researchers, whose job is to advise Tory MPs on all 
political issues, from climate change to potholes.

Each Tory MP pays the PRU £4,000 a year for research services. The MPs claim it back from IPSA as an expense. 

One researcher, Anthony Pickles, quit after a year working at the PRU, dismayed by its ‘drinking culture’.

‘Anthony flagged up his concerns very
 clearly but nothing was done,’ said a source. ‘He was appalled at the 
way people went out drinking.He did his best to draw it to the attention
 of the authorities.’

Speaking out: The shocking disclosures came as ex-Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans (right) called for action to stop public figures being subjected to a 'witch-hunt', while former Minister Michael Fabricant (left) revealed he reported Mr Corby to party chiefs  after being approached by PRU whistleblowers three years ago

Mr Pickles is now Chief of Staff of the Welsh Conservative Party.

To avoid blame for the PRU fiasco, Ministers were quick to point out last night that technically, the unit is not part of the Conservative Party.

It operates in Parliament and is answerable to a board of Tory MPs.

Senior Tory MP Oliver Heald, former chairman of the PRU, held an inquiry two years ago into the ‘sex party’ claims at the 2011 Tory conference in Manchester, and the allegation that Mr Corby was rude after returning to work under the influence of alcohol.

Mr Corby was given a formal warning.

Casual: The photo of Iain Corby in an open-necked shirt portrays a man at play, not at work

The message – accompanied by a ‘selfie’ – posted by Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU) chief Iain Corby on gay dating app Grindr at the Tory conference in Manchester in 2011 seemed clear.

The photo of Corby in a casual, open-necked shirt, portrayed a man at play, not at work.

‘Open to offers!’ it announced. It appeared to be an open invitation to anyone else logged on to Grindr nearby to join him at his three-bedroom suite at the Light ApartHotel.

Helpfully, it gave details of Corby’s location and personal information: ‘The light hotel, 35 years old, 173cm, white.’

It even gave the hotel’s address, ‘20 Church St’.

There was only one problem: Corby and 
his PRU team are employed to advise Tory MPs on party policy and were 
there funded by taxpayers, via MPs’ expenses.

A very different type of ‘party’ features on Corby’s Grindr messages: a ‘gay party’.

Tory
 chiefs were well aware of Corby’s Grindr exchanges and his 
taxpayer-funded stay with a group of PRU aides at the Light ApartHotel.

They
 were alarmed by references to two well-known and powerful Tory MPs with
 close Downing Street links. Neither attended any sex party – or went to
 the Light ApartHotel. The Mail on Sunday has redacted all names in the 
Grindr messages.

When the 
Grindr claims were followed by allegations of a ‘heavy drinking culture’
 in the PRU and unsubstantiated claims concerning gay sex and young male
 aides, Tory chiefs launched an official investigation after a 
complaint. Corby was given a warning.

Party chiefs congratulated themselves that a potential scandal had been swept under the carpet.

But
 it has come back to haunt them after word swept Westminster last month 
of a new Tory scandal involving the PRU. Two weeks ago, Corby resigned. 
The official reason was he wanted to ‘return to the commercial world’.

Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed the Grindr row – and this week we disclose full details.

Corby’s Grindr messages in Manchester start just before midday: ‘Enjoying the penthouse.’ It has the desired effect, soon afterwards, another Grindr user, who is not named, replies: ‘Penthouse? I’m only in standard.’

‘Yep. Top 2 floors. Quite nice!’ Corby replies.

The exchanges soon get more intimate. ‘Sharing with two colleagues but I chose the cutest boys from my team!’ says Corby, teasingly. ‘All in one bed!’ comes the excited reply.

The steamy theme continues with a suggestion that a married Tory has cheated on his wife with a ‘girl’ in one room; references to ‘orgy!’ ‘your fit housemate’ and a named man who ‘did come to  the gay party’. Corby’s anonymous respondent then quips: ‘Sleep to the top!’

It is at this point that the first senior Tory is referred to, apparently as a joke. Corby replies with mock outrage: ‘Oh please.  I don’t need to sleep with MPs.’

His Grindr ‘playmate’ takes issue with him, stating some younger MPs are ‘hotties’, naming one whom he says he ‘likes’. He continues: ‘How about a trip up to your room later?’

Corby replies: ‘XXXXXX is just out of the shower walking around naked. He knows how to keep his boss happy even if he claims to be straight.’ Back comes the reply: ‘He wants a pay rise! Am I competing with him?’

It is not known what happened after the exchanges.

One member of the PRU who visited the Light ApartHotel during the 2011 Tory conference told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I didn’t see any sex parties when I was at the hotel, but rumours of wild goings on there were the talk of the conference.’

Mr Corby was unavailable for comment.
