For parents worried about lending 
their precious car to their even more precious teenage children, it 
sounds like the answer to their prayers.

An
electronic system will be fitted to new Ford cars from next year that 
will force young motorists to drive safely when they ask to borrow the 
family motor.

The system will limit the car’s top speed and even stop teenagers turning the volume up too high on the stereo.

Key to safety: Ford's MyKey system will allow parents to limit the speed of the family car when their teenage children drive it

The
safety feature, which has already been dubbed ‘teenage mode’, springs 
into action when the young driver uses a special second car key.

Officially known as MyKey, the system is programmable by parents, allowing them to set a top speed of between 45mph and 80mph.

Once the car reaches a certain speed, a chime sounds, and the car plays a spoken warning to slow down.

The system also features an early warning when the driver is running low on fuel.

Neat: The MyKey system uses programmable keys

Another safety feature is ‘emergency assistance’ in the event of a crash serious enough to trigger the passenger airbags.

If
there is such a collision, the car’s on-board computer will send a 
message through the mobile phone network to the emergency services. The 
message will include the co-ordinates of the accident.

It is not only ‘boy racers’ whose antics will be curtailed, but teenage girl drivers, too.

Ford
cites research which shows that while excessive speed is the cause of 
30 per cent of accidents involving young male drivers, it is also the 
cause of 21 per cent of accidents with young female drivers.

Paul
Mascarena, Ford’s chief technical officer, said of MyKey: ‘It’s 
targeted at young drivers, though it is useful for fleet operators as 
well.’

The car maker said 
that it had feared the ‘electronic spy’ would prove unpopular with 
teenagers, but initial trials in America have proven otherwise.

It was found that parents were more willing to lend their car with the safety feature operating.

‘We
were concerned that children would see it as Big Brother watching 
them,’ said Mr Mascarena. ‘But they are now getting more access to the 
vehicle. And from a parental perspective, there is peace of mind.’

Ford
said research shows that 46 per cent of parents say speeding is their 
biggest worry while their offspring are driving, followed by talking on 
mobile phones while at the wheel (37 per cent) and their child being 
distracted by others in the car (35 per cent).

Matthew
Avery, crash and safety research manager at safety testing company 
Thatcham, said it was possible insurance companies might reduce young 
drivers’ insurance premiums for using the system.

MyKey will be introduced into all new Fords in Britain next year.

The
move was welcomed by a spokesman for London Ambulance Service, who 
said: ‘We work closely with the other emergency services to try to 
educate young people about the dangers of speeding.

‘It
can sometimes come down to peer pressure, but the results can be 
devastating for themselves, their passengers, families and other road 
users.

‘Our staff can also 
be affected by responding to calls where youngsters have been killed or 
seriously injured and it is even sadder because a lot of the most 
serious incidents could be avoided.’
