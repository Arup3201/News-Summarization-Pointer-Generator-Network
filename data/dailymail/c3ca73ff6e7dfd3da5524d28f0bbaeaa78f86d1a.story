Food and fashion isn't the most likely of pairings (unless it involves kale), however one North London bakery is determined to marry the two together.

Bunny Little's Bakery in London's Tuffnell Park runs with the ethos 'food is my fashion' and creates delicious bespoke cakes inspired by the latest catwalk trends.

The bakery is the brain child of Katy Taylor and her wife Anabel Fielding and draws on Katy's experience in the fashion industry to create the stylish sweets which such as 'Stella McCartney star biscuits' and 'Erdem cupcakes'. 

Fashionable foodie: Katy set up Bunny Little's bakery where she combines her style knowledge with her passion for baking 

Katy  is no stranger to fashion having worked as a fashion writer, editor and stylist for top global magazines including Vogue and Tatler.

She had previously dipped her toes into the catering world by helping to cater for events hosted by Anabel in her role as CEO of global event company for the stars Quintessentially Events.

Katy had always dreamed of opening her own bakery and finally quit the fashion rat race to pursue her passion nine months ago.

If anyone is able to fuse the unlikely pair of fashion and food Katy is the woman for the job but even she admits that it isn't the most obvious combination.

'As a stylist, for me I have always related fashion back to food which is a bit of a weird combination but it comes down to the same concept.

'It's about creating a look and editing it down, both industries are very entwined.'

Celebrity favourite: Bunny Little attracts all sorts of famous faces including Damian Lewis and Kate Beckinsale 

For Katy the process of turning haute couture into hot cakes is one that requires a lot of thought. 

The pieces that inspire her creations affect everything from the decoration right down to the texture of the cake.

'I look at the brand and the latest catwalk images and I examine the colours and get a feel for the trend. I look at the fabrics, are they light? Then I might create a lighter cake.'

Katy is well aware of the fashion industry's mild phobia of sugary food and has catered accordingly.

'I think about who would buy the clothes if they were female then maybe I would make a brownie bite rather than a great big slab.'

Bunny Little's bakery gained it's title from Katy's nickname after friends compared her to the Energiser bunny. However, Katy is not one to lend her name to a company she isn't involved with and insists on being as hands on as possible.

Katy was inspired by the floral design of Erdem, right, when she created these lemon and pistachio cupcakes

Knows her stuff: Before opening the bakery had worked at many fashion publications including Vogue and Tatler

'The bakery has been open nine months now and I am there every morning. We are a little local bakery and opening a small business is really competitive.

'I think it is really important to go in every day in order to build up a relationship with your customers.' 

Katy has entered an industry that is booming. The first episode of this year's Great British Bake Off fetched viewing figures of 6.3million and Mary Berry's empire is currently worth a tasty £5m.

Katy agrees that she has entered the business at the right time and she believes that we all deserve a treat.

'Oh there’s definitely a huge trend for baking right now. Everyone works so hard these days I think baking provides that bit of escapism especially during the winter when you’re nesting a bit more.

'It's great to produce something where you know where all of the ingredients have come from. I think that is really important to people these days because we are all so educated about food origins.'

That's another thing about Katy, she knows her audience and isn't as complacent to believe that she can make a business out of pretty cakes alone.

The 32-year-old has now expanded the bakery into a deli too selling gourmet sandwiches every lunch time.

'And we have three different kinds of sausage rolls!' she adds.

'We have also just got a license to sell alcohol which is great so customers can buy a lovely red or rose that I have picked out and take it away for dinner.' 

Despite having been open for less than a year, Bunny Little has gained itself quite the reputation with several celebrities frequenting the bakery.

'Damian Lewis comes in all the time,' says Katy adding that her bakery is soon to make an appearance in a Hollywood blockbuster.

'Simon Pegg and Kate Beckinsale have been filming Absolutely Anything together and they set some of it in the shop. We closed it for four days so I hope they don't edit us out!' 

Although Katy is thrilled to have attracted several A-listers her ambitions for her shop lie much closer to home. 

'We want people to come and buy their morning coffee from us rather than a coffee chain where it all tastes a bit burnt.

'Me and Anabel always regret the things we don't do and we wanted to make something that our community would be proud of.'
