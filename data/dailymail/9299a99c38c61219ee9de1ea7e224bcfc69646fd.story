Crystal Palace's London derby with West Ham was the highlight of Saturday's special 50th anniversary edition of Match of the Day... but not for the events on the pitch.

The BBC brought back legendary commentator Barry Davies for a one-off appearance to guide viewers through the action at Selhurst Park.

And the 76-year-old, rolled back the years with his masterly, unrehearsed commentary while looking resplendent in a bright green blazer.

It lead to colleague Dan Walker tweeting: 'Davies is so good he's even won the Masters.'

BBC's flagship football show topped off the seventies theme with retro scoreline graphics and old-style team formations.

TV viewers were also impressed that Crystal Palace coach Gerry Francis had appeared to join in the fun by sporting a splendid mullet but the 62-year-old has had the hairstyle for years.
