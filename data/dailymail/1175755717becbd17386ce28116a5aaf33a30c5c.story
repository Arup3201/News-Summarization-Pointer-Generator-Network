Alan Irvine is acutely aware that defeat at Stoke City on Sunday would put his position deeper in doubt — but the West Bromwich Albion head coach maintains that a positive result to match their performances is coming.

West Brom lost 3-1 to reigning champions Manchester City to leave Irvine conceding that he could ‘not necessarily’ be confident of keeping his job.

They have lost six games out of eight and are two points above the relegation places. Chairman Jeremy Peace has shown a decisive touch in the past.

‘I think we have been playing better than the results have shown,’ said Irvine.

‘I’d love to have more points but I don’t think anyone who watches us can feel we’re playing badly. We created a lot of chances.’

Irvine has managed to inspire a result when under pressure this season, but West Brom have a woeful record against Stoke, winning three of their last 34 meetings — losing 21.

Cutting out individual errors is crucial — Ben Foster and Joleon Lescott were at fault against City — and having Saido Berahino back firing could prove decisive.

The England Under-21 striker has not scored since October but was restored to the starting line-up on Boxing Day and had two good chances that went wide.

‘His movement was good and our passing was good to get him in,’ said Irvine.

'He snatched at a few things which you do when you are desperate for a goal. I would expect Saido to score one but he hasn’t been too far away.’

Meanwhile, Stoke midfielder Glenn Whelan admits he is playing for his future. The Republic of Ireland midfielder will be out of contract in the summer but he wants to extend his six-year stay.

After making his first start in almost three months in the 1-0 win at Everton on Boxing Day, Whelan indicated that he still has to convince the club he is worthy of a new deal.

‘At the moment anything could happen,’ said the 30-year-old. ‘I’ve got myself back in the team now and my aim is to stay in so I can prove people right and wrong.

‘Personally, I only have five months left and ideally I want to stay, but if not I’ll go elsewhere.’
