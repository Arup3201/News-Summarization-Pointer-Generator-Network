A picture posted on France's official Twitter account revealed a fundamental error ahead of their friendly match against Sweden... they'd spelled their own player's name wrong on the back of a shirt.

PSG defender Lucas Digne has made a number of appearances for his country - every age category from Under 16s to the senior team - but it appears someone behind the scenes isn't quite sure how to spell his surname.

In a picture posted on social media, it became immediately apparent that they had missed the letter 'I' from his shirt.

Digne, whose kit is sandwiched between Dimitri Payet's and Yohan Cabaye's in the changing room, had no such problem on his second shirt, which was all present and correct.

The 21-year-old plays his club football for Paris Saint Germain, for whom he signed in 2013, winning a league title in his maiden season.

He began his career at Lille, where he played 49 games before his move to the Parc de Princes.
