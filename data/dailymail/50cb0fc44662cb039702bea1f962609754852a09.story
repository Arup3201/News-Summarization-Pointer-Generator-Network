Accused: Christopher Sena, 47, allegedly sexually abused children for more than a decade

A father who is accused of sexually abusing children for more than a decade told victims he would kill them or break their legs if they told anyone about the assaults, it has emerged.

Christopher Sena, 47, his wife, Deborah Sena, 50, and ex-wife, Terrie Sena, 43, who all lived together in a trailer in Las Vegas, are accused of abusing at least eight children over 13 years.

Some victims were relatives, while Christopher Sena also encouraged his children to bring their friends over to the house so that he could abuse them, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported. 

He allegedly told one girl and one male victim to 'bring female friends over' and to make sure they wore bathing suits, according to the police report.

Another female victim, who is now an adult, said she saw Christopher Sena take 'a number of her friends' into his office, police said. 

One woman who says she was sexually abused told investigators that she believes her high school friends were assaulted by Sena.

Neighbors told the Review-Journal that he would seem 'excited' when his sons brought girlfriends over to the house.

Others described the Sena property as the place many neighborhood kids would hang out. Christopher Sena would erect a projector screen in the yard and hold movie nights, they said.

To stop his victims from speaking out about the abuse, he told at least two of them that he would kill them or break their legs if they spoke out, they told police.

Christopher Sena was arrested in September when Deborah, who recently split from him, another woman and a child told a family attorney about the alleged abuse.

The attorney went to police, as is required by law, and a SWAT team stormed the house on September 18 to arrest Sena and seize his recording equipment. 

Authorities allegedly found videos showing all three adults engaging in sex acts with children, which led to the arrests of Deborah Sena and Terrie Sena last week. 

At least eight minors were involved and some encounters were filmed as part of a child porn operation, police said. 

One alleged victim told authorities that when Sena started abusing her as a child, the two women were not aware of it, but when she was 17, she was forced to engage in sexual activity with them.

That victim started to strike her stomach with a piece of wood, fearful that he would fall pregnant with Sena's child, police said.

Some of the victims say they were abused for years; one boy said the abuse started when he was three and continued until he was a teen, while another woman said she was abused two or three times a week by Sena for more than a decade.

But according to police, who called it 'one of the most horrific sex rings in memory', he was not the only one carrying out the abuse. 

His ex, Terrie Sena, told police she was attracted to young male and female teens, and said it was 'really enjoyable' when one of the boys started to look like Christopher Sena.

But she told authorities that she later felt 'ashamed' and 'dirty'. 

Terrie and Christopher Sena had three sons and a daughter together before splitting in 1997. But after they split, Terrie continued to live with her ex and their children, even when he took a new wife.

Authorities also allegedly found footage of Deborah Sena, who left her husband in August, involved in sexual acts with the family dog.

Deborah Sena told police that there was 'fear and intimidation' involved when it came to dealing with her husband Christopher (pictured together in an old photo), whom she split from in August

 Deborah says her husband said that, if she loved him, she would do what he wanted her to do

She claims her husband told her she would do what he wanted if she loved him. 

One of the seized recordings also allegedly shows two Sena children having sex with the family dog, The Daily Beast reported.

Christopher Sena is facing 23 charges, including incest, bestiality and felony child abuse. Many of the charges carry a sentence up to life in prison.

The women, who were arrested on December 11, together face 27 charges, including child abuse and neglect, sexual assault of a minor and incest.

Police said they expect more charges to be brought against the trio. All three have been held without bail.
