A 5p charge on throwaway carrier bags came into force in Scotland yesterday, leaving England as the only home nation yet to tackle the blight and waste they cause.

The new levy is designed to encourage shoppers to switch to re-usable bags. 

It is hoped the move will have the same positive effects as in Wales and Northern Ireland, where there has been a massive reduction in the number of bags issued at tills.

Scotland has introduced 5p charge on carrier bags, making England the last home nation to introduce the levy

At the same time, profits from the bag charge will be donated to good causes, providing a financial lifeline to charities, particularly those involved in tackling litter and improving parks and green spaces.

More than 160 retailers including Marks & Spencer, McDonald’s and The Co-operative Group have registered for Zero Waste Scotland’s Carrier Bag Commitment, launched earlier this year.

This means organisations have agreed to donate the net proceeds from the charge to good causes.

The introduction of a charge has proved popular with shoppers where it has been introduced, based on the evidence that it reduces waste, litter and harm to the environment.

But the Coalition government in Westminster has dragged its heels on adopting the system in England.

England is expected to see a 5p charge introduced in October next year, however this is not certain and it is wrapped in a series of small print caveats which means it will be more complex and less effective.

The scheme in England will exempt small shops, despite the fact the Association of Convenience Stores say they do now want to be left out.

It will also exempt paper bags, despite the fact they are considered more damaging to the environment than plastic in terms of the energy used in production and the gases created when they are dumped.

The British Retail Consortium (BRC), which speaks for the biggest supermarkets and other national chains, said the adoption of the different and ‘overly complex’ scheme for England will confuse shoppers.

The Daily Mail’s ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign launched in February 2008 called for action to end the waste and litter blight caused by discarded bags. The introduction of charges in other countries, from Ireland to parts of the US, India and China, has led to reductions of more than 80per cent in the numbers handed out at the tills.

The Scottish government estimates that 800 million single-use bags are given out by supermarkets every year in Scotland alone. Campaigners hope this figure could be cut by 750million.

The Scottish Environment Secretary, Richard Lochhead, said: ‘I’m extremely proud that this landmark legislation is now in force. Our carrier bag addiction is symptomatic of our throwaway culture and has serious implications for the environment.

He added: ‘Huge numbers of these bags end up as litter, blighting our communities and clogging up our seas and natural habitats, affecting many sorts of wildlife and marine species in particular.

‘We want that to change and for people to stop and think about whether they really need to take another bag. Alternatives like bags-for-life are easy to get and are much more sustainable.’

The Marine Conservation Society said the moves in Scotland highlights the lack of action by the Westminster government.

Emma Cunningham, MCS Pollution Campaigns Officer, said: ‘It’s truly unbelievable that England is being left behind in this matter.

‘Despite successful and popular actions from all the Devolved Administrations – the latest from Scotland – which we applaud, it looks like the English charge will not follow the successful systems in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland but instead will have caveats for the charge depending on the size of the shop and the type of material.’

MCS Pollution Programme Manager, Dr Laura Foster, said: ‘A 5p charge on all single-use carrier bags, regardless of the material they are made from is a really encouraging step forward and millions of bags will now not end up in Scottish waters thanks to this decision.’

She added: ‘We have strong evidence that turtles and other sea creatures mistake plastic bags for food like jellyfish. They eat them and then die a painful death from choking or stomach blockages. Gulls are regularly seen eating bags looking for the food they once carried, and many other animals are known to consume plastic bags accidentally.’

MCS hopes retailers will donate the charge to environmental organisations that, for many years, have been spending time and money campaigning for a ban on bags and, more importantly, clearing them up.
