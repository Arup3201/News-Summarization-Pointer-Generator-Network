Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has confirmed he is interested in Loic Remy and is monitoring the QPR striker's situation following the collapse of his move to Liverpool.

The French frontman was poised to complete an Â£8.5million switch to Anfield last week, only for the Reds to pull the plug on the deal due to doubts over his medical.

Uncertain future: Remy is in limbo after his move to Liverpool collapsed

Hoops boss Harry Redknapp has urged the former Marseille forward to decide his future as soon as possible as he shapes his squad for the new campaign.

However, Pardew is ready to launch another bid to land the 27-year-old, who fired 14 goals in 24 starts during a successful loan spell last season, on a permanent basis.

'I am surprised about what's happened with Loic because I thought he was signing for Liverpool and the door was slammed shut,' Pardew told the Chronicle Live.

'I didn't expect that, and we certainly had no problem with Loic during his time here. So we shall monitor his situation.'
