The team that supported Vincenzo Nibali to victory in this year’s Tour de France were faced with suspending themselves from racing on Friday after one of their riders failed a test for the banned blood-boosting drug, erythropoietin.

Maxim Iglinskiy was a member of the nine-man Astana squad that helped Nibali secure victory in July and the Kazakh-funded team have already provisionally suspended their rider after the UCI reported that he had failed a dope test on August 1.

Now, however, regulations could demand that the team has to suspend itself as well, causing huge embarrassment to Nibali in what would amount to another crushing blow to the sport in its battle against doping.

Astana team manager Alexandre Vinokourov, the Olympic road race champion in London in 2012 and himself a convicted doper, said in a statement: ‘In accordance with regulations of the MPCC (Movement for Credible Cycling) to which the Astana team first adhered in 2013, the rider is suspended provisionally and shall remain out of competition in anticipation of the results from the B analysis. All Astana Pro Team riders are contractually obliged to respect strict ethical rules and regulations.’

The MPCC regulations also demand that a team must suspend itself from racing for eight days in the case of multiple positives over a 12 month period. Only last month Iglinskiy’s brother and fellow Astana rider Valentin was also suspended for failing an EPO test in August.

Astana – which was also the team Alberto Contador rode for when he won the 2010 Tour, only to then be stripped of the title because of a doping offence - are now set to miss next week’s Tour of Beijing.
