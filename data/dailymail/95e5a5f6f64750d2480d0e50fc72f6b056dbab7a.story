Boris Johnson and Chancellor George Osborne have announced more 24-hour rail services in London in a £6.4 billion boost to the capital's economy.

The pair donned hard hats and neon orange hi-vis jackets  to join the London Underground night shift team ahead of the announcement that night-time services will be expanded to include the London Overground and the Docklands Light Railway- creating half a million jobs.

The Mayor of London and Mr Osborne shared a tea break with Tube workers and viewed overnight engineering works on the Victoria line before before going on to outline a six-point plan including 24-hour London Overground services in 2017 and all-night services on the Docklands Light Railway by 2021.

But shortly after their night-time stint, the politicians were back in hi-vis- this time in a fetching yellow- to demonstrate their plastering skills at a new London housing development.

Both the Chancellor of the Exchequer Mr Osborne and Johnson attempted to help plaster at the Aura residential development which is under construction, in the Edgware district, before announcing plans to identify public sector sites in London for future housing developments.

There they also announced the expansion of 24-hour rail services in London, as well as extended wi-fi on the Tube.

However, rail unions described the announcement as a 'blatant pre-election stunt' and queried how the £6.4 billion had been worked out.

Currently 24-hour services are due to begin on the Northern, Victoria, Piccadilly, Jubilee and Central lines from September 12.

Night-time Tube services will also be expanded to the Metropolitan, Circle, District, and Hammersmith and City lines once Transport for London's modernisation programmes are completed. 

The Government said it will provide £10 billion of funding for investment in new TfL infrastructure over the next parliament, including new Tube improvements, better roads, more buses and cycle lanes, amid predictions that London's population will top 10 million by the early 2030s.

The Mayor of London also confirmed plans for 200 more Routemaster buses this year and committed to 800 new buses a year from 2016, securing jobs in Ballymena and Falkirk, where 90 per cent of TfL's buses are manufactured.

Mr Osborne said: 'We are today committing to provide London with £10 billion for new transport improvements.

'We live in a 24-hour city, and the Mayor is going to set out how our plan will deliver a 24-hour Tube operation to support it.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson and Chancellor George Osborne said that night-time services will be expanded to include the London Overground and the Docklands Light Railway- creating half a million jobs

'I am also asking the Mayor to think big about the capital's long-term needs.

'I want these plans and others worked up, properly costed and prioritised so we can make a decision to go ahead in the Government's spending round this summer.'

Mr Johnson said: 'As London's population continues to grow, it is investments in infrastructure such as this which will ensure that the capital remains competitive and the best big city to live in.

'Today we have committed to additional night Tube services, the first 24-hour London Overground and the purchase of hundreds of brand new buses. This, combined with the promise of future investment in projects such as Crossrail 2 and the Bakerloo Line extension, will ensure we keep the capital's economy moving well into the 21st century.'

Mick Cash, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, said: 'This announcement has been dropped on London by the Mayor as a blatant pre-election stunt without a shred of consultation with the union. That is a ridiculous way to conduct important negotiations and to unveil major service developments.

The pair, pictured enjoying a tea break, have outlined a six-point plan including 24-hour London Overground services in 2017 and all-night services on the Docklands Light Railway by 2021, an expansion of 24-hour Tube services, as well as extended wi-fi on the Tube

Mr Osborne, who had visited the tunnels of the Victoria line with Boris Johnson, said Londoners lived in a 24-hour city and needed a 24-hour Tube operation to support it

'RMT is not opposed to extended running but there are massive issues on staffing, safety and maintenance which have not been addressed and which would need to be signed off by our reps.

'This announcement has been made against the backdrop of a near doubling in assaults on staff, cuts to over 1,000 jobs and the axing of guards on London Overground.

'Night running would mean increased drunkenness and risks to both passengers and staff alike and could only work with substantial increases in staffing right across the board, and that means an immediate reversal of the current cuts programme.'

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'Boris Johnson's publicity stunts are getting more and more desperate and deluded as he heads for the exit door at City Hall to become an MP on May 7 for Uxbridge.

'How he and George Osborne think they can dream up policies in Tory Central Office for the next Labour mayor to follow when he or she is elected next year is beyond me.

'His night Tube starting in September will lose millions and is not due to break even for another 18 years, and yet here he is, with another back-of-a-fag-packet publicity stunt.'
