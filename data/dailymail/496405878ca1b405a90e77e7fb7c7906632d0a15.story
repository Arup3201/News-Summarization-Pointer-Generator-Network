A man was arrested this weekend after he allegedly vandalized a Burger King and then he posed for his mugshot with a very dirty face.

Police say Jamie Henson, 36, was intoxicated when he placed at order at an Orlando Burger King on International Drive at 3:20 a.m. on Saturday morning but he was arrested before he even got to eat his meal.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that Henson pushed the door of the Burger King so hard that it fell off of its hinges.

When officers arrived at the scene after responding to a criminal mischief complaint, they found Henson talking on his cell phone.

An officer told the Orlando Sentinel that as he approached Henson, he could hear him saying, 'the police are here' and that he had to 'get off the phone.'

Henson attempted to run away from the officer but he was detained after running just 100 feet away.

Henson is charged with criminal mischief and resisting an officer without violence.

'No force was used to detain Henson and no injuries were sustained by myself or Henson,' Officer Matthew Davis said in his report.

Henson's face was drenched in mud when he posed for his mug shot but the police report nor Henson ever explained how he got so dirty.

Henson caused the Burger King around $500 in damages.

'I was able place the door back on the hinges but noticed there was still damage to the hinges and closing mechanism,' Davis said in the report.
