Manchester United duo Robin van Persie and Daley Blind have been called up to the Holland squad for their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Iceland.

The Oranje need a win after losing their first qualifier 2-1 against Czech Republic in manager Guus Hiddink's first competitive game back in charge.

The United pair will link up with fellow Premier League players Leroy Fer of Queens Park Rangers, Stoke defender Erik Pieters, and Newcastle's Tim Krul and Daryl Janmaat.

Holland will also be boosted by the return from injury of Bayern Munich forward Arjen Robben and Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.

One player who won't be involved in the Dutch squad is former Liverpool utility man Dirk Kuyt who announced his retirement from international football on Friday. 

Kuyt made 104 appearances and scored 24 goals for his country, including playing at three World Cups and two European Championships in a variety of different positions.
