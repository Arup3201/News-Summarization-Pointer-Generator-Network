The brother of two of the Bali bombers has pleaded for his family to be forgiven on the tenth anniversary of the atrocity which left 202 people dead.

Ali Fauzi, whose brothers Ali Ghufron, also known as Mukhlas, and Ali Amrozi were executed  for their role in the 2002 attack, apologised to victims' families saying his siblings' actions were wrong.

He told Australian News Channel ABC: 'I think it is counterproductive. It resulted in a negative response from society.

'I think all forms of violence, I disagree with, because violence will only give birth to more violence.

'Whether it's done deliberately or not, violence will always have a dangerous impact on humanity.'

On October 12, 
2002  the al Qaida-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group launched terror 
attacks on two Bali nightspots packed with tourists in the resort of 
Kuta beach.

Various members of Jemaah Islamiyah were
later convicted. Three - Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Huda bin Abdul 
Haq - were executed by firing squad in November 2008.

Among the 202 dead were 88 Australians, 26 Britons, nine Swedes, seven Americans, six Germans and four Dutch nationals.

Around 4,000 relatives and friends of the victims are in Bali to mark the anniversary. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and 
Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono are among those due to attend.

Susan O'Donnell, whose daughter Amber 
was killed while on her way home from dinner, was among the many 
Australian families who made the trip.

She told ABC: 'And one of the girls said, "Oh look, there's the Sari Club, I've heard it's really good, let's go in there".

'One minute, they walked in the door and the bomb went off.

'Just fate played its hand.'

'They deserve to be remembered. They were young people just enjoying themselves. They weren't doing anything wrong.

'It wasn't like they were killed in war. They were killed for religious fanatics and we're not even religious.

'It just seems so unfair. It's so unfair to just murder 200 people like that. It's terrible.

She added: 'And we're glad they got a bullet between the eyes. We're glad.

'We went to the trials, and they deserved a bullet between the eyes and that's what they got.'

Authorities have raised the country's
security alert to its highest level after receiving intelligence of a 
threat to the ceremony.

In the last six weeks alone Indonesia's anti-terrorism squad has broken up two cells in the central Java city of Solo.

One, calling itself Al Qaeda in Indonesia, were found in possession of bombs primed and ready to go.

Indonesian police have warned of 
possible attacks  and have brought in reinforcements to 
protect the thousands due to attend.

The attack was a watershed for 
Indonesia, which has the world's largest Muslim population and forced 
the secular state to confront the presence of violent extremists.

Indonesia has been largely successful 
in containing militancy and there have been no big attacks on Western 
targets since 2009, when suicide bombers attacked two hotels in the 
capital, Jakarta, killing nine people and wounding 53.

But the warning over Friday's 
commemoration is a 
reminder of the lingering danger.

Deputy Chief of Bali Police Ketut 
Untung Yoga Ana said: .'From the information that we have gathered, 
there are indications of movements aimed at VIPs who will attend the 
event.

'Therefore, the police and army forces, including the community, have made sure their readiness.'

Yoga Ana said police had brought in reinforcements from Jakarta and the military was also helping with security

'There are 1,003 police officers in Bali and 118 personnel reinforcements from headquarters,' he said.

'This excludes security officers for 
VIPs from the TNI which will be as many as 1,000 personnel,' he added, 
referring to the armed forces.

After the bombings, security forces detained nearly 600 militants, most of whom have been jailed.

In March, police shot dead five 
suspected militants planning attacks on Bali, including an assault on a 
night club popular with foreign tourists, the national counter-terrorism
agency and police said.

During the attack three bombs detonated - a backpack carried by a suicide bomber and a car bomb which both devastated Paddy's Pub and the Sari Club opposite, followed by a third device outside the US consulate in Denpasar.

Many relatives are calling for renewed efforts for a final suspect to stand trial.

One
British campaigner Susanna Miller, whose brother Dan, 31, died in the 
attacks, which left his wife Polly seriously injured, is calling for a 
final push to make sure those responsible are held to account.

One
of the terrorists associated in the bombing, Riduan Isamuddin, known as
Hambali, is still believed to be being held in detention in America.

She
said: 'We have been campaigning very hard over the years for him to 
stand trial and be charged. He has been in Guantanamo for nine years.'

Ms Miller, 45, branded the situation an 'open travesty of human rights', adding: 'It plays brilliantly into hands of the recruiting sergeants for al Qaida.

'We find ourselves in this slightly curious position of fighting for the rights of one of the people responsible for the deaths of our relatives.'

Ms Miller visited the Foreign Office last week to discuss the issue and a spokesman confirmed it is being looked into.

She said feeling justice had been served would make victims' relatives 'minds quieter'.

'My
brother was a lawyer, he believed in justice, he believed in the rule 
of law and it's particularly invidious that the single most important 
trial has not taken place and the detention of this terrorist actively 
helps recruit others.'

Remembering
the moment she found out what had happened, Ms Miller said she was in 
Mumbai with her partner while her brother was in Bali with wife Polly - 
the couple, who lived in Hong Kong, had married just five weeks earlier.

Destroyed: Three masterminds in the Bali bombing attack already have been tried and executed, and authorities have made big strides in dismantling their regional terror group, Jemaah Islamiyah

'I turned on my mobile when I woke up in the morning and it exploded with texts and missed calls so I opened the first text message and it said, 'phone home'.

'I spoke to my father who told me a bomb had gone off. We immediately turned on the TV.'

She returned to the UK then later flew to Bali to help in the hunt for her brother, but it was later confirmed that he had died. So had his and Polly's bridesmaid Annika Linden, 30, and several of their friends.

Ms Miller said many relatives of the British victims were not travelling to Bali for the 10th anniversary because of security concerns.
