Andrew Williams (pictured outside Leeds Crown Court today)  was handed a 12-month supervision order and told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work

A Mayor who pocketed £220 in takings from an ice cream truck during his town’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations has been spared jail.

Andrew Williams, 44, was wearing his official chain as Mayor of Ripon, North Yorkshire, when he was handed the money by an ice cream seller who meant for it to be passed on to the council.

However, instead of passing the money on to Ripon City Council, Williams - who was depending on payday loans and had a gambling problem - took it for himself.

The offence, which occurred during a Diamond Jubilee event in Ripon in June 2012, came to light when the council’s accounting committee noticed the money had not been paid.

Williams was found guilty of fraud by a jury at York Crown Court in June and sentenced at Leeds Crown Court today.

Judge Guy Kearl QC said Williams had brought disgrace on his office and said the most appropriate sentence was for him to work in the community he deprived.

He said: ‘It is the fact you were Mayor of the city at the time which is of greatest significance because you were trusted to look after people’s money.

‘What you did is unforgivable.

‘You have brought disgrace on the position you occupied and you have eroded the confidence of the public in the position of Mayor of Ripon.’

The court was told that in return for selling ice cream at the Jubilee event, John Taylor of Harrogate-based C&M Ices had agreed to hand over 20 to 25 per cent of his takings to the council.

At the end of the day, he owed £220 and put it in a bag which he later handed over to Williams.

However, Williams fraudulently kept the money for himself having racked up a number of payday loans and gambling debts.

Prosecutors told how Williams, who was then chief executive for a law firm, was estimated to have lost around £31,000 through gambling and had borrowed around £14,000 in loans.

However, Alasdair Campbell, representing Williams, disputed he had lost as much through gambling as the prosecution claimed and argued he had since sought help for it.

He said as a result of the case, Williams had lost not only his job but another as a credit controller for an asbestos removal company when there was publicity about his conviction. 

He also did not seek re-election for Harrogate Borough Council or for North Yorkshire Council but chose to remain a councillor at Ripon until next year to save the cost of a by-election.

The judge handed Williams a 12-month supervision order to address his gambling problem and ordered him to carry out 200 hours of unpaid community work.

The money taken by Williams has since been repaid to the council by an anonymous person.
