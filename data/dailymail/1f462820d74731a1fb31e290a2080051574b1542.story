The 1998 book was a New York Times bestseller

The 1998 book, which was a New York Times bestseller, aimed to help readers overcome their darker side.

In the book, which includes practical exercises, Ford claimed that by denying our dark side, we reject these
 aspects of our true natures rather than giving ourselves the freedom to
 live authentically.

She explained that it is possible to acknowledge 
and accept our weaknesses because these qualities may be
 important, hidden strengths.

For example, perhaps some 'selfishness' 
can save us from exhaustion and resentment.

Her sister, Arielle, said in a statement that the author wanted to help people break free from their emotional baggage and fear.

Ford wrote eight more books, led workshops and hosted TV and radio shows related to that topic.

She often shared her battle with drug addiction, divorce and other personal struggles in her work. She is also survived by her mother, son and brother.
