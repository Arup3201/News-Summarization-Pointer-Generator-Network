Concerned parents in South Carolina are up in arms after their children returned from school with fliers encouraging them to participate in a beauty pageant.

The pageant at Indian Land Elementary School was to find a warrior king and queen to 'represent their school all year long during school events.'

Winners would be judged on their 'facial beauty, sparkling personality, and overall appeal,' read the flier, and there would be extra prizes for 'best smile, best hair and best eyes.'

Protest: Angry parents took to Facebook to voice their concerns about a local beauty pageant

Parent David Dodson was so angered by the pageant that he started a Facebook page to protest.

The ‘Say “No!” to Indian Land Elementary Warrior School Pageant’ page featured an image of Honey Boo Boo, the infamous seven-year-old television star who loves beauty pageants, with a red line through her to illustrate their objection to the pageant.

'We try to teach our children that there's much more than someone's outside appearance,' David Dodson told Channel 9.

'I think that kids get enough pressure today to look a certain way, to act a certain way, without bringing something like this in, that is being promoted and is tied to the school, I don't think that's right.'

The protest proved popular with other parents and within three hours, the page had received 100 likes and messages of support from other concerned parents.

One parent posted that her daughter had come home crying because she didn’t think she was going to be beautiful enough to enter, let alone win, the contest.

Organizers have acted quickly following the outraged reaction from parents and the event, which was due to take place on October 20, has now been cancelled.

Event organizer Tracy Hyland has been involved in pageants with her daughter for more than 20 years and is a national certified pageant judge.

'As a parent - watching my child go across the stage - it's wonderful,' she told WBTV.com.

'Let's think about the other activities children do - football, dance, soccer, swimming, ice-skating - all of those things are judged.'

She says that she received approval from the principal to use the school's name and the pageant was intended to raise funds to buy playground equipment.
