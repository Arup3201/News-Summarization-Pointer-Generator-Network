Action: Foreign Secretary William Hague said Britain and France want to be able to ¿take urgent action¿ in the event of future atrocities

Britain will try to tear up the EU arms embargo against Syria next month so weapons can be supplied to rebels in the country, William Hague announced yesterday.

The Foreign Secretary claimed chemical weapons have been used in Syria and said Britain and France want to be able to ‘take urgent action’ in the event of future atrocities.

He announced that Britain will supply 34 vehicles, including five armoured 4x4s, and 20 sets of body armour to those seeking to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad.

Mr Hague revealed that he will press the case for an end to the EU arms embargo in talks with foreign counterparts in Istanbul on Saturday.

He said no final decision to arm the rebels has been taken, but stressed that Syrian moderates lack weapons that are easily obtainable by the regime and Al Qaeda extremists.

The Foreign Secretary told MPs: ‘The use of chemical weapons in Syria would demand a serious international response.

'The UK is increasingly concerned that there is evidence of the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Our policy on Syria cannot be static in the face of this growing calamity.’

He added: ‘We have taken no decision that we would like to send arms to the Syrian opposition but the UK and France argue that we will need further amendments to the EU arms embargo or even to lift it.

‘We need greater flexibility if we decide that urgent action is necessary, for example in response to a specific incident or continued grave deterioration on the ground.’

Government sources say the UK and France want the embargo lifted to help persuade Russia to stop arming the Assad regime. Under EU law, the embargo has to be adopted by all 27 member nations at the end of May or it will lapse.

A senior source said: ‘We want it rewritten or scrapped. The French are with us. The hope  is that that will focus minds  in Moscow.’

Jordan is already spearheading efforts to arm the rebels using weapons paid for by Saudi Arabia. Mr Hague’s words will fuel concerns that Britain risks being sucked into a civil war which has left more than 70,000 dead and which shows little sign of abating.

Critics have warned that arming the rebels will be especially problematic because many opposition groups have been hijacked by Al Qaeda supporters.

Mr Hague said: ‘There are legitimate arguments against [arming Syrian rebels]. If we were to take that step we would have to assure ourselves to the maximum degree, not only of the legal position but that they could not be misused by other people for whom they were not intended.’

But he added: ‘It must also be a major consideration that a regime that is not bringing the conflict to an end can get weapons, that extremists can get weapons, but that people that are in favour of a free and democratic Syria find it very difficult to do so.’

In addition to the armoured vehicles, Britain will also deliver eight trucks, six SUVs, five pick-ups, a recovery vehicle and four forklifts to the rebels. The equipment is part of a non-lethal package worth less than £3million that also includes 107 generators, 130 solar-powered batteries and civil resilience kits.

Mr Hague faced criticism from his own side. Tory MP Dr Julian Lewis said that if the Assad regime fell, the Government could not guarantee that chemical weapons would not fall into the hands of extremist fighters in Syria. ‘It just took a couple of dozen people to organise 9/11,’ he warned.
