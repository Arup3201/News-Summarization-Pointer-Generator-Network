Caught out: Jeremy Clarkson has been given the first points on his driving licence in 30 years after being caught speeding

After being chased out of Argentina by an angry mob, you would think that Jeremy Clarkson would keep a low profile for at least a few weeks.

But the under fire Top Gear presenter has found himself in trouble again after getting a speeding ticket for the first time in 30 years. 

The controversial motoring show host wrote in his column that he had been travelling '80 something' in a 60mph zone, and brushed off the incident, saying it was 'nothing catastrophic, nobody died.'

Clarkson was snapped by a speed camera while driving too fast on a 260-mile drive from Whitby, North Yorkshire, to London. 

Despite noticing the cameras on a stretch of the M1 near Derby, Clarkson, 54, was caught out for the first time in three decades.

He was told he was driving too quickly to attend a speed awareness course and was given points on his licence. 

When asked what speed he was doing when he was snapped by the fixed camera, Clarkson told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I can’t even remember, 80 something, 82 in a 60, nothing catastrophic.’

He added: ‘I was only a couple of miles over being allowed to do the [course], it’s not catastrophic, nobody died.’

Road safety campaigners jumped on his comments as irresponsible. Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of RoadPeace, a charity for crash victims, said his comments were ‘absolutely shocking’.

‘We should penalise people for excessive speed – it’s risk-related and it’s dangerous,’ she said, adding: ‘We should expect more from him and he should be able to afford a car with a speed limiter if needs be.’

Clarkson previously caused offence with a speeding remark in 2008 when he claimed to have driven 186mph on a public road, saying: ‘The speed limit’s annoying for people who have a job to do.’

Writing in his column for The Sun last month, Clarkson moaned about the number of speed cameras he passed while on the long drive to London in a BMW M3.

Earlier this month,  Clarkson and the Top Gear crew were attacked by an angry mob in Argentina after a row over the number plate on a car he was driving through the South American country

Firstly, the Top Gear host passed a speed camera van on what he described as a 'magnificent road' over Fylingdales Moor.

He said he was still 'lightly fuming' when he was then restricted to a 50mph speed limit for a long stretch of the M1 between Sheffield and the turn-off for Derby.

The furious BBC presenter wrote in his column in September that he would like to 'stick some cocktail sticks into [the] eyes' of the person who came up with the speed restriction.

He added: 'And it gets worse because when the roadworks finally ended, I found myself on a stretch where there are speed-camera gantries every few hundred yards, to catch those who are desperate to make up for lost time.'

It seems that despite taking note of the cameras, Clarkson did not slow down enough.

Today he complained that the cameras had caught him, handing him his first points since the 1980s.

He wrote: 'Last month, I wrote in a blind fury about how many speed cameras I'd encountered on a drive from Whitby to London.

'Well, it seems one of them got me. Sadly, I was going too quickly for the speed awareness course to be an option. Which means I'm getting some points on my licence. My first in 30 years. Grrrrr.'
