Volkswagen's controversial Super Bowl ad that some have called racist because of its use of white actors impersonating Jamaicans ran during the end of the second quarter on Sunday despite calls for the company to cancel the spot.

The commercial, which was unveiled nearly a week before the big game on Monday, ignited claims of racism with one critic saying 'it’s like blackface with voices.'

The 60-second spot features a white man who is apparently so happy about his Volkswagen that he speaks with a Jamaican accent as he tries to cheer up others in his office.

But the advert, which cost the German car maker about $8 million to air during Super Bowl XLVII, struck many has being offensive since it suggests that people in the Caribbean are relaxed and don't feel stress.

'It's just saying, ''Black people are happy,''' Barbara Lippert, editor-at-large of Mediapost.com, said during an appearance on the Today show earlier in the week.

'Didn't anyone look at this? This is so racist,' she added.

Lippert wrongly predicted the car company would pull the ad before the game, which is routinely watched by more than a hundred million viewers and costs companies $4 million for 30-seconds of airtime.

During a segment Monday on CNN's Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien, New York Times columnist Charles Blow also blasted the ad.

'I don’t like it all,' he said during the roundtable discussion.

'It’s like blackface with voices. I don’t like that.'

The ad begins in a crowded office elevator with one person complaining about Mondays, with another quickly chiming in that they are 'the worst.'

'No worries man, everything will be alright,' the Volkswagen owner tells his colleagues in a thick Island accent.

The man is later seen hanging out at the coffee machine and then approaches a co-worker who appears overwhelmed.

'Julia, turn the fround the other way around,' he instructs her.

Later, the man admits to a co-worker that he is from a place as opposite as a tropical island as one can find - Minnesota.

He then tells a conference room full of people hearing terrible news about the company that: 'You know what this room needs? A smile. Who wants to come with us?'

He then takes his boss and another person along for a ride in his red Beetle.

When they get back to the office, an uptight man tells them they are three-minutes late, prompting the other two men in the car to respond in their Jamaican accent 'don't be no cloud on a sunny day' and 'yeah, chill out Winston.'

All three men in the car adopted Jamaican accents once they got in the Volkswagen

Tim Mahoney, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Volkswagen of America, said on CNN that the company consulted with 100 Jamaicans and used a dialect coach on-set to ensure that the accents were accurate.

'We obviously did our homework to make sure that we weren’t offensive,' he said.

Mahoney added that famed Jamaican performer Jimmy Cliff sings a cover of the Partridge Family's 'C'mon, Get Happy.'

But that hasn't satisfied everyone.

Christopher John Farley, a Jamaican-born journalist, wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the accents reminded him of the controversial character Jar Jar Binks from the Star Wars movies, who used a Caribbean accent and broken English for comedic effect.

Jar Jar Binks drew criticism when he appeared on film in 1999's 'The Phantom Menace' for his speaking patterns

'It’s off-putting to see the Island spirit used as a punchline,' he wrote. 

'The Jamaican aesthetic–shaped by such Jamaican-born notables as Bob Marley, Marcus Garvey and the revolutionary Nanny of the Maroons–is founded on positive vibration, not mindless happiness.'

The spot also has a few defenders.

During the CNN debate, O'Brien, who has developed a long-running series, 'Black in America' that probes issues of race in the country, said she enjoyed the ad.

And during the segment on the Today show, host Matt Lauer responded to  Lippert's criticisms by saying, 'I take a completely different view of it, to be honest with you.

'I thought, If you buy this car, it puts you in a happy place.

'And what's happier then the memories we all have of being on beautiful islands on island time. That's the way I took it,' he said.

And one commentator, Michelle Stalling, wrote on the car company's YouTube page, where the ad has more than 7 million views, 'Jimmy Cliff and VW. I see positivity and happiness in this Ad. I﻿ love it.'

The criticism from others is rare for the car company, which two years ago produced the most talked-about ad for the Super Bowl.

This 2011 Volkswagen ad was widely praised for its warmth and humor

The commercial featuring a young boy pretending to be Darth Vader and remotely 'starting' the car was widely praised.

'It ate up the internet, it was the most popular ad ever,' Lippert said of the 2011 commercial.

'This one is clearly a mistake in judgment.'
