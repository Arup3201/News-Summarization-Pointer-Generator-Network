Petr Cech's agent has confirmed that Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco have both made contact about the Chelsea goalkeeper.

The 32-year-old Czech could leave if Thibaut Courtois returns to Stamford Bridge. Cech has been Chelsea No 1 for a decade after joining from French side Rennes, and long been regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world but there is evidence his powers are beginning to fade.

Speaking to Czech website Aktualne, his agent Viktor Kolar maintains Chelsea have yet to say Cech is no longer required but other clubs have made enquiries.

'He has two years left on his Chelsea contract and has an interest to continue there,' said Kolar. 

'Mourinho did not tell him that he would not count on him anymore. We have not been given any signals that Petr would be made available [for transfer].

'If that was the case, though, you have to realise that Petr is one of the world's top goalkeepers and has a certain salary. There are not many clubs who could afford to sign him.

'Paris Saint-Germain have shown interest and we have also communicated with Monaco.'

Kolar confirmed he would contact other clubs if Chelsea confirm Cech can go.

'I would get in touch with Zubizarreta (Barcelona) and people at Real Madrid. These are clubs we would consider if Chelsea wanted to get rid of Petr. We would also consider Bayern but they have Neuer there. 

'Then there are leagues Petr would not go to. For instance, Serie A, because clubs in that league have problems.'

Meanwhile, Borussia Monchengladbach believe they have won the race to sign Chelsea's Thorgan Hazard on loan next season.
