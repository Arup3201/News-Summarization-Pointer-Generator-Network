America has long been known for its cultural diversity but the rise of the Hispanic population is unlike any other minority group in the country's history.

By mid-century, up to one in four Americans will be of Hispanic descent and the white majority will give way to a so-called 'minority majority.'

The US Census Bureau defines Hispanic or Latino to refer to 'a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American (except for Brazil), or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.'

The Economist reports that more lenient immigration laws in the 1960s took the Hispanic population from just 7m in 1970 to 57m today, a number which is predicted to double by 2050.

Rise of Hispanic America: Hispanics are becoming the nation's largest minority but inequalities between whites and Hispanics still exist 

The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 abolished the quota system based on national origin.

National quotas limited the number of people who were allowed immigrate from other countries.

Thanks to the Civil Rights Movement, the immigration policy shifted and became focused on reuniting immigrant families and attracting new labor to the United States.

For nearly two centuries and up until the time Ronald Reagan was president, white European immigrants made up to 80 per cent of the US population.

Now less than two thirds of the population are white and whites will be a minority by 2044, says Census Bureau.

Since 2000, the population of the United States has grown by slightly over 40 million people. Thirty five million , or 90 percent, of that growth is from minorities - Hispanics, Asian Americans and African Americans, says a report published byBusiness Wire.

The U.S. Hispanic population jumped to 58.2 million in 2015, an increase of 2 million during the past year, says the same report.

The growth of the Hispanic population is due to both convenient geography and rising birth rates, says The Economist.

The United States is close in proximity to Hispanics' several countries of origin which makes immigration and communicating with families back home much easier.

Increase in numbers: More lenient immigration laws in the 1960s took the Hispanic population from just 7m in 1970 to 57m today, a number which is predicted to double by 2050

Rapid growth: Close geography of Latin countries to the United States and growing birth rates among Hispanics in America is causing rapid population growth compared to other minorities 

Currently, 85percent of Hispanics are legal residents and Latino growth is not so much from immigration anymore as it is from births in the United States.

According to a study published by Pew Research on March 9, births within the Hispanic community drives 78 per cent of population growth in the United States.

Despite Hispanic growth, many inequalities still exist between whites and minority groups. 

Currently American Hispanics earn less money, on average, than white Americans. The median income of Hispanic homes at $36,949 and the medium income of white households at a much larger $75,448.

With almost 1million US-born Latinos reaching voting age annually, and Latinos making up a significant portion of America's labor force,  income is expected to rise along with nationwide education reform. 

US companies have also been advised to shift their focus to Hispanic consumers who will be making up a majority of the US population and will account for much of the nation's future spending habits.

The future: It is predicted that by 2050 there will be double the amount of Hispanics than there are today 

Shift from immigration to native births: Currently, five-sixths of Hispanics are legal residents and Latino growth is not so much from immigration anymore as it is from births in the United States

Geographic closeness of Hispanic countries to the U.S. along with rising birth rates among Hispanics within the country account for the growth
