These stunning images capture a graceful show by a rare white whale.

Photographer Jenny Dean managed to shoot the action last month as the humpback dived out of the water in Etty Bay near Innisfail, far north Queensland.

The mother-of-three, who is a clinical nurse and midwife, was on a whale-watching trip with her husband when they spotted the amazing mammal in the water.

Sensational: It could have been Migaloo, thought to be the only all white humpback whale in the world

It could have been Migaloo, thought to be the only all white humpback whale in the world. Migaloo is believed to migrate up the east coast of Australia from Antarctica to the warmer waters of Tropical North Queensland.

Jenny explained: 'On Saturday, August 17, my hubby suggested we take a trip in our boat to see if we could spot some whales which had been around the previous day when he had been fishing.

'I have had many whale watching trips on a promise that ''there were heaps around yesterday'' and they have all resulted in no sightings at all.

Glad: Photographer Jenny Dean revealed she had been reluctant to go out that day as she was sceptical of spotting a whale

Photographer Jenny Dean, who captured the dramatic pictures, said it had been an amazing experience

'I was a bit reluctant to go out on that day, lots to do and sceptical about success, but just out of Mourilyan Harbour, near the North Barnard Islands, we could see on the horizon a long distance away, a humpback breaching and blowing over and over again - having a whale of a time.

'It was heading south quite quickly and too far away to pursue so we continued on our way.

'After about 10 minutes we noticed that the whale had changed direction and seemed to be coming closer still with lots of activity then at about 200 meters distance it gave us a real show with lots of breaching and blowing once again.

'We cut the boat motor and sat and watched the show and couldn't believe it when it seemed to be the extra special Migaloo, the infamous all white whale.

'When he disappeared we thought it was all over but out of the depths he came straight up and looked at us from about 50 metres away. That was absolutely incredible, just checking us out.

'After that he continued to frolic around the 50 metre mark again appearing to show off, then dived down and headed back towards the boat.

'There were a few anxious moments where we wondered where he would surface, and while holding our breaths we heard a big blow and he was about 50 metres on the other side of the boat.

'After that he continued on his merry way having checked us out and shown off enough!

'It was an amazing experience, incredible to see that huge creature propel out of the water with such ease and agility. Even better to catch some pictures and they even worked out OK which considering the boat was rocking and Migaloo was very fast and unpredictable is double lucky.'

What lies beneath: Jenny said the humpback continued to frolic around the boat and even appared to be showing off
