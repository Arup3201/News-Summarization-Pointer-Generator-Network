On leave: Steubenville High School Superintenent Michael McVey was placed on leave after new charges in relations to the rape of a girl, 16

The Ohio grand jury which is investigating whether there was a cover-up in the notorious Steubenville rape case today announced the indictment of four more people - including the school superintendent and an assistant football coach.

Steubenville High School superintendent Michael McVey was hit with felony charges for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice in the case of the sexual assault of a 16-year-old girl by two high school footballers after an alcohol-fueled party in August 2012.

In addition to McVey, assistant coach, Matthew Belardine was charged with allowing underage drinking, obstructing official business and making a false statement.

Two other school employees, Wrestling coach Seth Fluharty and elementary school principal Lynette Gorman, were charged with failure to report child abuse.

'People made bad choices and the grand jury said there are repercussions,' Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said in announcing the indictments today at a news conference.

The high school’s beloved head Coach Saccoccia , who was accused of telling football players that he would protect the two rapists from any repercussions, is not facing any consequences from the grand jury.

Charges: Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announces indictments against four additional people in relation to the 2012 rape of a high school student

The charges have been handed down by the grand jury convened in April to investigate the circumstances surrounding the rape of the 16-year-old girl by Trent Mays, 17 and Ma'Lik Richmond, 16, who were found guilty in March and sentenced to at least a year in juvenile prison.

The grand jury panel has met 18 times, heard from 123 witnesses and spent seven months working on the case.

The grand jury had investigated whether adults like coaches or school administrators knew of the rape allegation but failed to report it as required by state law.

Last month, the grand jury also issued indictments against William Rhinaman, the Steubenville schools' technology director, who is accused of tampering with evidence and obstructing justice, and his daughter, who was indicted for theft unrelated to the rape case.

'Some may ask why others were not indicted,' DeWine said, as he explained that a grand jury needs probable cause to charge someone.

'It is simply not sufficient that person’s behavior was reprehensible, disgusting, mean-spirited or just plain stupid,' he said.

'Barring any new evidence, I believe that the grand jury’s work is done.'

DeWine said that small city of Steubenville had been traumatized by the actions of a few.

'It's time to let Steubenville move on,' he said.

Mr DeWine had made clear his intention to root out all guilty parties in the ongoing investigation into the case that shocked America when it came to trial in March.

Then promising high school football stars Trent Mays, 17 and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were found guilty of raping a 16-year-old in a series of back to back house parties.

Images of the girl, catastrophically drunk, naked, abused and humiliated were posted online.

Friends of the rapist, and their victim, tweeted vile comments and exchanged pictures of the girl, strung up between her attackers by her wrists and ankles.

Mays was sentenced to a minimum of one year in juvenile detention for the two counts on which he was convicted: raped and possession and distribution of pornographic material involving a minor.

Richmond was charged only on the count of rape and sentenced to a minimum of one year. Both face a maximum of detention until the age of 21 and have to register as sex offenders thereafter – a punishment against which Richmond has since appealed.

The crime continues to divide the blue-collar town on the Virginia River.

With the victim too drunk to remember the crime texts and pictures taken on the night saw the attackers convict themselves with their own words.

The first the victim knew of her fate was when pictures of her lying naked on a basement floor were posted online.

The conduct of Head Coach Reno Saccoccia has come under particular scrutiny and led to online petitions demanding the High School official be fired.

Saccoccia refused to even bench his stars at first, telling the principal and school superintendent that the players did not think they had done anything wrong and therefore he had no reason to suspend them from the team.

Saccoccia has coached two generations of Big Red players and won three state titles and 85 per cent of his games.

He was made Head Coach in 1984 and in 1991 Big Red became the fastest team to win 100 games in Ohio's history.

In 2007 the field at Big Red's Harding Stadium, which feature a huge rearing horse that breaths fire whenever the home team scores or comes on the field and is known locally as Death Valley, was named Reno Field in Saccoccia's honor

MailOnline was the first to report that the 63-year-old coach could face charges and that investigators planned to interview him and all 19 of the High School's coaching staff.

However, DeWine announced today that the Grand Jury was finished and therefore Saccoccia will not face charges
