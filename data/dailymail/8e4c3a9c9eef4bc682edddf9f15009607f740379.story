Wimbledon legend Dave Beasant has criticised his former team-mate John Fashanu over claims he made during a recent documentary about the infamous Crazy Gang.

The documentary followed the path of Wimbledon from their arrival in the old First Division in 1986 to their FA Cup success in 1988.

The programme portrayed the dressing room as violent and often cruel place dominated by a few individuals, but former goalkeeper Beasant was keen to point out that certain aspects had been exaggerated.

Speaking on BBC One, Beasant said: ‘There’s been a lot said about the Crazy gang of late and lot of what has been said was self-promotion of certain individuals.

‘A major factor in a recent documentary has been John Fashanu and he’s brought to light an incident with Lawrie Sanchez which actually happened two years after the FA Cup final so for him to bring that in and make such a part of it and say that they didn’t like each other in the cup final – Fash goes over and gives him a kiss and that was before kissing had started.

‘They fell out later. For him to bring that into the documentary I feel was a wrong decision.’

Beasant isn't the only member of the Crazy Gang to voice his displeasure with certain aspects of the documentary.

Terry Gibson wrote on his blog: 'Do people really believe that John Fashanu controlled and dominated our dressing room, ruling by fear of him? 

'Does anybody really believe him when he said he locked people in a boot of a car, that he would tell someone they wouldn’t be allowed to eat for 2 days and that someone was going to be watching over them 24/7 so that they couldn’t? 

'The bloke is deluded. In truth WE tolerated him and laughed at him, he really was and still is a clown.'
