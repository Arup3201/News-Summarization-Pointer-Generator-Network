Car rental companies in Europe are adding 'winterisation charges' on their vehicles that will see standard rates soar for tourists. 

Winter tyres and snow chains on hire cars are compulsory in some areas and can be up to £114.

iCarhireinsurance.com researched the costs of five rental companies in seven European ski gateways (Geneva, Grenoble, Innsbruck, Barcelona, Turin, Sophia and Inverness) for a week's hire from December 27 to January 3, 2015.

Winter tyres are just one thing that will add cost to hiring a car in Europe this winter

It found the average 'winterisation' cost across the seven destinations was over £40, but could be up to £114 in Geneva with Avis, significantly increasing a customer's overall rental cost.

Paying the winterisation charge of almost £60 in Barcelona with Budget, for instance, represents an additional 30 per cent on the original hire cost. 

In Austria and Germany winter tyres are mandatory, yet despite this Avis levy a 'winterisation' charge of £25 in Innsbruck. 

The added charges for 'winterisation' have been blasted by the founder of iCarhireinsurance.com

Snow chains must also be used, where instructed in mountainous areas, in France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Austria and Andorra. 

(average costs to hire a medium compact car for a week) 

Geneva - £409.43. Winterisation - £114.45.

Barcelona - £235.81. Winterisation - £52.54.

Turin - £396.66. Winterisation - £40.46.

Sophia - £160.18. Winterisation - £24.89.

Inverness - £242.55. Winterisation - £0.

Innsbruck - £254.81. Winterisation - £25.

Grenoble - £287.41. Winterisation - £29.60.

The 'winterisation' cost is included in the rental price in some instances but this varies greatl. 

For example Budget did not charge extra in Geneva or Innsbruck but charged £57 in Barcelona, £40 in Turin and £24 in Grenoble. 

In Barcelona all five rental companies charged a 'winterisation' fee averaging £53.

'Car hire companies are well known for surprise snowballing costs at the rental desk,' said Ernesto Suarez, CEO and founder of iCarhireinsurance.com. 

'Why each individual customer should be held to account for winter tyres that have been changed once for the winter season is ludicrous and is another example of hidden costs that can make the original rental price not such a good deal.'

'It's frustrating that that the rental companies use 'winter' as yet another opportunity to make money from their car hire customer but unfortunately it's your responsibility and not the rental company's to make sure that you're driving with the correct equipment for wintery conditions.

 'We advise that you shop around and make sure that you factor in the 'winterisation' cost.'
