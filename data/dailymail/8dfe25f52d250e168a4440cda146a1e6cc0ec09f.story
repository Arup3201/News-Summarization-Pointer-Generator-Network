It has emerged Martin Place siege victim Katrina Dawson was struck by a police bullet when officers stormed the Lindt Cafe firing at Man Haron Monis.

A police investigation has also revealed the gunman had enough ammunition with him to kill all of the hostage.

Ms Dawson, 38, was not directly hit by a bullet but possibly a ricochet when Tactical Operations Unit officers raided the cafe just after 2am on December 16, multiple sources have confirmed to Fairfax Media.

Monis had just executed another of the hostages, cafe manager Tori Johnson, at close range, and was killed in the shoot-out.

This news comes after it was revealed police found 20 more rounds of ammunition inside the pocket of Monis, according to news.com.au.

From initial lines of inquiry, it is believed Ms Dawson was struck in the heart by a ricocheting bullet while on the floor and again in her shoulder.

The siege's second victim, Tori Johnson, was shot in the head from behind - at close range - by Monis before officers raided the cafe, a source told News Corp. 

The circumstances surrounding the 16-hour Martin Place siege is still the subject of a critical incident investigation by the homicide squad.

Ms Dawson's cause of death will be determined by the NSW Coroner once that investigation is completed.

A police spokeswoman told Fairfax Media the force would not be commenting on any aspect of the investigation until that process had been completed.

Police also would not confirm if bullets had been found in Monis' pocket following the end of the siege.

But a source confirmed to News Corp after his shoot-out with police, where they sprayed more than 27 shots at the gunman, they found at most 20 rounds on his body.

The details of the final moments of the Sydney siege emerge days after it was revealed the gunman Man Monis was dropped from the national watch lists on the same year he was reported to AFP for repeatedly threatening an Islamic school principal.

As more information comes to light about Monis’ violent and disturbing past, people continue to question why the man with a history of threatening behaviour was not being more closely monitored by authorities.

It is alleged Monis repeatedly made threats to the principal of a South Sydney school, accusing him of being a traitor and a 'sell-out' for allowing the school to engage in interfaith activities, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

After sending about 12 abusive faxes, ranting about the school’s choice to associate with a Jewish school and for holding an inter-faith Anzac Day ceremony, Monis' messages became more sinister.

'People like you will get what's coming your way,' he wrote to Osman Karolia, who was the then-principal of Arkana College in Kingsgrove.

Mr Karolia became concerned and asked if that was intended as a threat, to which Monis replied ‘yes’.

Mr Karolia contacted Australian Federal Police, deeply concerned Monis was acting in a hostile manner towards himself and the school.

Although Monis was investigated, police still elected to stop monitoring Monis by removing him from watch lists that same year.
