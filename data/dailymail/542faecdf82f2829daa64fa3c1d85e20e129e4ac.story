President Barack Obama will today make a desperate push for the Palestinians to drop a statehood bid when he addresses the U.N. General Assembly today.

Obama will follow up his speech with separate meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as he seeks to coax both parties back to direct peace talks.

But as U.S. officials attempt to steer Palestine away, unrest was growing in the West Bank today from residents calling for independence.

President Barack Obama will try to talk Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas out of an official push for statehood

The talks come as several thousand Palestinians streamed into the center of this West Bank city today in a show of support for their president's bid to win U.N. recognition of a Palestinian state.

The rally, in a small square in downtown Ramallah, was carefully orchestrated, with civil servants and schoolchildren given time off to participate. Crowds of youths hoisted Palestinians flags and chanted slogans calling for the establishment of an independent Palestine.

At the same time, U.S. officials are 
conceding that they probably cannot prevent Palestinian leader Mahmoud 
Abbas from moving forward with a request to the U.N. Security Council 
for full Palestinian membership.

Recognizing that Abbas seems intent to 
proceed, Obama is expected to privately ask the Palestinian leader to 
essentially drop the move for statehood recognition after Abbas delivers
a formal letter of intent to the U.N. on Friday.

'The president will say, frankly, the same thing in private that he'll say in public, which is that we do not believe that this is the best course of action for achieving Palestinian aspirations,' White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said.

Obama will also meet today with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The Obama administration has pledged 
to veto any Palestinian statehood bid, arguing that only direct peace 
negotiations, not a U.N. vote, would allow the Palestinians to achieve 
the benefits of statehood.

With
peace talks stalled, the U.S. and international partners have been 
negotiating intensely this week over the steps it would take to bring 
the two sides back to the negotiating table.

The new approach being considered would 
see the 'quartet' of Mideast peace mediators - the U.S., European Union,
United Nations and Russia - issue a statement addressing both 
Palestinian and Israeli concerns and setting a timetable for a return to
the long-stalled peace talks, officials close to the diplomatic talks 
said.

Israel would have to accept its pre-1967 borders with land exchanges as the basis for a two-state solution, and the Palestinians would have to recognize Israel's Jewish character if they were to reach a deal quickly, officials close to the talks said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing diplomacy.

The White House publicly appeared to hold out slight hope that enough progress could be made to stop Abbas from formally requesting statehood recognition.

'President Abbas has indicated his 
determination to go to the Security Council, so we take him at his word 
on that,' Rhodes said.

Today's
march appeared subdued, with many people using the day off to mingle 
and do some window shopping. While turnout was modest, participants said
the gathering sent an important message.

'We
want to live in dignity,' said Atallah Wahbeh, a 60-year-old 
shopkeeper. He said it was important that the U.N. recognize the 
Palestinian cause, even if there are repercussions, such as a possible 
cut in American aid.

'We don't need the Americans to buy us with money,' he said.

A new poll indicated there is overwhelming popular support for Abbas' recognition quest.

Some 83 percent of Palestinians believe it's a good idea, even though nearly as many - 78 percent - say they expect it will make their daily lives more difficult, according to a new poll by the independent Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research. The survey, conducted last week, included 1,200 respondents and had an error margin of 3 percentage points.The U.N. bid is seen by many Palestinians as a last option, after two uprisings and two decades of negotiations with Israel failed to produce a state, said pollster Khalil Shikaki. "It's simply a belief that the status quo is worse than the worst that can come out of the U.N.," he said.

The simmering situation is far from the scenario Obama envisioned when he spoke at the U.N. one year ago.

'We should reach for what's best within ourselves,' Obama said last September in pushing for negotiated agreement on a sovereign Palestinian state.

'If we do, when we come back here next year, we can have an agreement that will lead to a new member of the United Nations.'

While the Palestinian statehood bid has overshadowed Obama's time at the U.N., he is also expected to use his speech to the international body to reflect on the sweeping changes in the world over the past year, most notably in the Arab world.

Rhodes said the president also would highlight significant foreign policy developments for the U.S., such as drawing down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the killing of Osama bin Laden.

Obama on Wednesday also planned to hold bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. He was to meet with leaders from Britain, France, Japan and South Sudan, the world's newest nation.
