It wasn't me... Manhattan dog Jack, who swallowed $1.11 in change, gives his best innocent look to the camera after vets saved his life

A belly full of small change caused a big problem for this Jack Russell who had to be operated on after slurping up 111 pennies.

Jack jogs the streets of New York daily and usually only eats the best holistic food, but he's got a voracious appetite and is always licking things off the floor, said his owner Tim Kelleher.

It was after knocking over a jar of pennies while going for a few crumbs of bagel that the pampered pooch chomped up the collection of coppers.

Dr Suliman Al-Ghazlat at BluePearl 
Veterinary Partners in New York had to use a camera attached to a net to
fish 111 coins out of the 13-year-old's stomach.

Scooping
up five at a time, the procedure took more than two hours. But letting 
the coins pass could have killed Jack because pennies made after 1982 
contain toxic zinc.

The day
the long-legged, broken-coat terrier ate the pennies, Mr Kelleher had 
left a sack with a few bagel crumbs on his desk at home in Manhattan.

pounced on the leftovers, but in so doing Jack knocked over a jar of 
pennies.

As he licked the crumbs off the floor, he slurped up the 
pennies too.

X-rays 
clearly showed the pile of potentially fatal pennies lodged in the small
dog's guts and vets decided the only option was an emergency endoscopy.

Endoscopy is a non-invasive procedure using a scope with a camera, which is safer and easier to recover from than surgery.

The procedure to retrieve the currency lasted approximately two hours. During that time, Jack was monitored closely under anaesthesia.

Besides the risk that the toxic zinc in the pennies could damage Jack's kidneys, liver and red blood cells, there was the danger that they could block the intestines and cause gastrointestinal problems.

'Early and safe removal was absolutely imperative to Jack’s health,' said Dr Amy Zalcman, a senior emergency doctor at BluePearl, who oversaw Jack’s treatment.

'If Jack would not have had the pennies removed, the consequences would have been fatal.'

Following the incident in March, Mr Kelleher told the Associated Press he thought he had 'Jackproofed' his apartment.

But just a few days ago, the hungry hound ate a whole bag of hamburger rolls after pulling it off a kitchen counter.

Hundreds of pets undergo surgery every year to remove small articles of clothing and other objects from their stomachs and intestines, said Dr Karen Halligan.

Dr Halligan, an author, TV consultant and the director of veterinary services for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Los Angeles, said ingested clothing can be the most dangerous, since it won't show on X-rays.

And surgeries to remove or dislodge things that pets swallow are not cheap. 'We are talking $2,500 to $5,000 at the least,' said Dr Halligan.

Frankie’s Friends charitable pet foundation contributed to help pay for Jack’s emergency procedure.
