A 'selfish' couple who wiped out a 91-year-old dementia sufferer’s life savings by helping themselves to her bank accounts were jailed for two and a half years today.

Lesley Reeve, 56, and husband Andrew, 55, spent all but £3,000 of her godmother Joan Killen’s £130,000 savings after the pensioner allowed them to become a signatory on her bank accounts.

The judge said they were guilty of a gross breach of trust and although they had been hard-working throughout their lives, he branded them 'utterly materialistic.'

Arriving at court: Andrew and Lesley Reeve, who spent two years splashing her elderly godmother's cash, were jailed toady

The couple cleared debts, bought a car for one of their two sons and spent thousands on electrical goods and presents for themselves, Teesside Crown Court heard during their trial last month.

They also spent some of the money converting the garage of their home in Hartlepool into a wet room and gym, but told police the work was really to make it into a bedroom for 'Aunty Joan, who by then was living in a care home.

They claimed they loved Miss Killen and said she was happy for them to spend her savings as they saw fit, as she planned to leave them everything in her will.

But while the Reeves spent tens of thousands on their family home, Miss Killen lived in a sparsely-decorated room in a care home.

On one occasion she asked for her personal effects to be brought in, but when the Reeves failed to do so, a member of staff went out and bought her some earrings and a jewellery box.

The couple held hands in the dock as they were sentenced by Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, the Recorder of Middlesbrough today.

He told them: 'You were found guilty by the jury on compelling evidence.

'What the jury concluded you did was to strip all the monies that your godmother, Mrs Reeve, had.

'You did so for your own selfish needs.'

The court heard that as a result of the Reeves actions Miss Killen, who is still alive, is now relying on the state to pay for her care costs.

Judge Bourne-Arton: 'You believed, and you may be right in believing, that she was going to leave all her money to you.

'But you pre-empted that process by deciding to take the money for yourself, at a time when you felt you needed it.'

The judge accepted some money was spent doing up the Miss Killen's home, as well as their own, but he said they expected to one day inherit that too, and were renting it out in the meantime to make money for themselves.

He added: 'You claimed you loved her, that you cared for her, that you effectively nurtured her and that you did nothing to harm her.

'You did none of that.'

Home improvements: Teeside Crown Court heard how Mr and Mrs Reeves used the money they stole to convert their garage into a gym and wet room but lied to police claiming the work was to make room for Miss Killen

He also pointed out that the visits 
Mr and Mrs Reeve made to the care home became more infrequent once the 
money ran out but  the couple blamed this on a fall-out with the staff.

He said: 'This is a gross breach of trust.'

'You have shown throughout these proceedings not one ounce of remorse.

'I have seen nothing, not even a flicker of regret for what you have done, indeed, quite the reverse.'

The judge acknowledged that imposing jail on two people of previous good character and of their age would be hard, and that they had lost their good name.

But he added:'You no doubt feel you have done well, you have been hard-working. But you are utterly materialistic.

Mr Reeve had claimed it was a coincidence that when police arrested the couple in a dawn raid, the gym contained a treadmill and exercise ball, and maintained the conversion was intended for Miss Killen.

That story was rejected by the jury who convicted them of stealing £95,000 in savings, and theft of rent money they made from getting a tenant to move into her property when she went into care after a fall.

Mrs Reeve was also convicted of stealing £2,940 in pension payments.

Paul Abrahams, defending Mr Reeve, said the couple will find it very difficult to be apart in jail having spent their lives together.

He also claimed that Mr Reeve, an engineer was likely to lose his job.

He said: 'Life will be very difficult for Mr Reeve when he is released,'

The couple now face a proceeds of crime hearing which will see them stripped of their assets.

Nigel Soppitt, defending Mrs Reeve said: 'She will lose her reputation, her assets including her home, her self-esteem and perhaps her mental health.'
