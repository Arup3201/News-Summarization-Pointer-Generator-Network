Instagram's Hyperlapse is the latest app to jump on the selfie phenomenon. 

A recent update to the app, which makes it easier for people to create timelapse videos, has added support for front cameras on phones and tablets - dubbed selfielapse. 

Hyperlapse also automatically stabilises videos, and lets users choose what speed their timelapse is played back at.

The app can be downloaded to iOS devices for free.

Users don’t need an Instagram account to create a hyperlapse. 

Instead, users open the app and are taken straight to the camera. 

Tap once to begin recording and tap again to stop. 

Choose a playback speed that you like between 1x-12x and tap the green check mark to save it to your camera roll. 

Hyperlapse is a free app available for iOS devices that officially launched in August. 

'Since launching nearly four years ago, it has always been a priority to bring the Instagram community simple yet powerful tools that let people capture moments and express their creativity,' the firm said at the time.

Selfies have been growing in popularity over the past year, but timelapses are also becoming more mainstream. 

Earlier this year, Apple added a Time-lapse Mode to its latest iOS 8 software, that lets iPhone and iPad users create similar shots.   

'Traditionally, timelapse videos depend on holding your phone or camera still while you film,' Instagram continued.

'Hyperlapse from Instagram features built-in stabilisation technology that lets you create moving, handheld time lapses that result in a cinematic look, quality and feel - a feat that has previously only been possible with expensive equipment.

The firm claims the apps makes creating timelapses simple.

'We designed Hyperlapse to be as simple as possible.  

'From documenting your whole commute in seconds or the preparation of your dinner from start to finish to capturing an entire sunset as it unfolds, we’re thrilled about the creative possibilities Hyperlapse unlocks.'
