In 2008, Snay bought a $20 scratch ticket 
at a Cumberland Farms in Hopedale and won $10 million.

Police believe he used his lottery windfall to groom and gain favor with people.

'Snay was the recipient of a $10 million dollar lottery award and that windfall aided the commission of the crimes,' said Chief Jeffrey Lourie. 

He is being held at the police station without bail and will be taken to Uxbridge District Court on Monday for arraignment.

The alleged crimes occurred over a four-year period, reports Telegram.com.

Police said they had been receiving reports from concerned residents that Snay was in close contact with young children, but it wasn't until recently that someone came forward, Chief Lourie said.

Snay was convicted six times of indecent assault and battery in the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1974 he received a one-year suspended sentence for indecent assault and battery on a child under 14. He violated probation and was sent to jail for a year.

Then two years later in 1976, Snay was sentenced to serve five to seven years in state prison after he was convicted of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14.
