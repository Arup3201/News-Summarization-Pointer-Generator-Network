A neuroscientist from Austin, Texas gave the love of his life a brain in a jar--a wedding gift that some may have trouble wrapping their heads around.

Michael Mack's bride-to-be Meg Mack on the other hand thought the gift was the most unexpected, thoughtful, and unique gift she'd ever imagined. 

Inside a jar meant especially for her was a 3D printed perfect model of her suitor's brain.

The delivery: A jar filled with a mystery item along with a note was delivered to bride-to-be Meg Mack before she was about to be wed in Austin Texas 

Befuddled: Meg Mack held a jar with some stuffing and a note from her husband to be Micheal but had no idea what would be hidden inside 

Some jewelry perhaps?: Meg Mack twists the jar in excitement to see what mystery might be hiding inside

'There was bunch of stuffing in there and then I thought "Oh my God, this is a brain,"' said Mack.

Both Meg and her husband Michael are neuroscientists and Michael says he thought of the gift because his wife loves men for their intelligence and brain.

'She judges people by their brain,' said the groom to the Houston Chronicle.

Both husband and wife work at the Center for Memory and Learning at the University of Texas in Austin so Meg was quickly able to identify just whose brain she was holding.

'It was a little bumpy and weird and then I thought, 'This is a 3D printing of his brain,' she said.

Not only did she recognize whose brain it was, she liked the way it felt in her hands and in her heart.

'His brain was very normal and very good-looking; that was a nice bonus to have,' said Meg Mack,

'It was pretty symmetrical ... not having anything too weird in it.'

The jar now sits on the couple's dresser in Austin and the couple are happy to share a life and a brain together. 

Layers: Meg had to search through layers of stuffing in order to find her zany and romantic surprise

What could it be: After pulling out spaghetti like paper shreds Meg Mack finally uncovered the brains behind her big wedding surprise

A brain: Meg and her husband are neuroscientists so it didn't take her too long to discover that the 3D printed gift in a jar was of a brain, her husband's to be exact

Great minds: Great minds may think alike and apparently they also make great wedding gifts, especially when both the bride and the groom are neuroscientists
