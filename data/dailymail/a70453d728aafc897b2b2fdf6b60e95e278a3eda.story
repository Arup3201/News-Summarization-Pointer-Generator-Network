Jonny Wilkinson and Owen Farrell both took part in training ahead of their Heineken Cup final on Saturday between Toulon and Saracens.

The duo were put through their paces by their respective coaches at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on Friday - the venue for the European showpiece.

Saracens fly-half Farrell is looking to win the competition for the first time after the Londoners' were knocked out 24-12 at the semi-final stage last season by the French outfit.

The 22-year-old believes the Aviva Premiership outfit have improved since their encounter last season.

'That match feels like a long time ago,' he said.

'Since then, we've changed the way we play a little bit, especially attacking-wise, and I think we've become more mature and confident in what we do,' he added.

Toulon talisman Jonny Wilkinson will be 
looking to end his affair with the Heineken Cup on a high after 
announcing his decision to retire from rugby on Monday.

The 34-year-old won the tournament with the Top 14 side last season and would love to finish his final professional match in the United Kingdom with a second European title to his name.

Ahead of the final, Sarries have been given a boost with news that captain Steve Borthwick will lead the side out in Wales.

Borthwick 
suffered a pectoral muscle injury and went off during the second half of
 Saracens’ Aviva Premiership play-off victory over Harlequins last 
weekend.

Saracens rugby director Mark McCall described Borthwick’s prospects earlier this week of being fit for the final as 50-50.

But Saracens confirmed in a team announcement on Friday that he will line up in his familiar second-row position when they bid to become the fifth English European champions after Bath, Northampton, Leicester and Wasps.

Former England skipper Borthwick will retire at the end of this season, with Saracens having two games left - the Heineken Cup final and an Premiership final showdown with Northampton at Twickenham in eight days’ time.

McCall
 has made just one change from the side that accounted for Quins, with 
scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth in for Neil de Kock, who is on the 
replacements’ bench.

For Toulon, fly-half Wilkinson leads a side that shows a solitary switch from the Heineken semi-final victory over Munster last month, with South African lock Bakkies Botha replacing Jocelino Suta.

Toulon parade their galaxy of world-class talent, including Wilkinson, centre Matt Giteau, wing Bryan Habana and prop Carl Hayman, while a successful Heineken Cup defence would see them join Leicester and Leinster as the only teams to achieve that feat.
