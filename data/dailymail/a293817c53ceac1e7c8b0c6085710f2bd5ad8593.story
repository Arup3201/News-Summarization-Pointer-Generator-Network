Guus Hiddink has confirmed Ron Vlaar suffered a fresh calf injury scare during Holland's defeat to Mexico in Amsterdam on Wednesday night.

Vlaar pulled up in the first half and was replaced by Lazio's Stefan de Vrij with the Aston Villa captain clearly in some distress. 

The new injury scare comes as a blow to both club and country, with Villa facing a fourth consecutive relegation battle and Holland needing their best and most influential players available after losing four of the last five games after finishing third at this summer's World Cup.

But in hopeful news for Villa, Hiddink confirmed it is not the same niggling recurrence of the calf injury that ruled out the former Feyenoord defender for 19 league games during the last three seasons for the club.

Karim Rekik has been called-up to the squad to replace Vlaar, but the defender, on loan at PSV from Manchester City, only has one previous cap as a substitute in a 2-0 defeat by France.

Hiddink confirmed on Wednesday night to Voetbal Primeur: 'It does not look good, Ron is having trouble with his calf. It's not the same place as last time that was totally different.'

Holland sit third in Euro 2016 qualifying Group A with three points from three games, six points behind group leaders Iceland and Czech Republic. They face Latvia on Sunday in Amsterdam.

Vlaar's contract is due to expire at the end of the season, and the 29-year-old been linked with a move to Arsenal and Manchester United, but contrary to reports from his agent the player has revealed he has had talks with Villa over an improved deal.

Speaking to the Birmingham Mail earlier this week, Vlaar said: 'I have spoken to the gaffer (Paul Lambert) a few times (about a new deal), but that is it so far.'
