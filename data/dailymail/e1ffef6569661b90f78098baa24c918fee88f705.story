Stoke City boss Mark Hughes feels Bojan Krkic has answered any doubts over whether he can cope with the grittier side of life as a Barclays Premier League footballer.

Bojan arrived in the English game over the summer with a reputation as a player of undoubted talent but also with question marks hanging over him.

Certainly, there was plenty of interest in seeing how the little forward - a product of the Barcelona academy who has also played for Roma, AC Milan and Ajax - would fare having joined the Potters, particularly on  the less glamorous occasions.

Bojan, though, is emerging as a key man for his new side and he produced a typically influential display in Stoke's 1-0 win at Everton on Boxing Day amid bitterly cold, soaking wet conditions.

The 24-year-old Spaniard proved the match-winner of a physical contest, earning and then converting a 38th-minute penalty.

And Hughes said: 'You saw the determination in Bojan, both in the initial run into the box and then to grab the ball and score the penalty.

'The Everton game was a new experience once again for him and I think he is really enjoying what is happening with his football.

'It was a cold, wet day, but all that is an old cliche.

Mark Hughes insisted that Bojan has proven he is able to perform even on a cold and wet day 

'It is something where if people see any weakness in Bojan's play or attitude to hard work, they will say he is not quite right for the English game.

'I think in the short space of time he has been here, he has knocked all those thoughts on the head because he has come in and shown he is an exceptional professional. He works really hard every day to get better and stronger.'

Eleventh-placed Stoke's next match is a home clash with West Brom on Sunday and Hughes is hopeful Bojan, who came off in the second half against Everton due to a back problem, will be available.

A head injury sustained by Ryan Shawcross in that game should not stop him from being involved, but Phil Bardsley is a doubt because of the ankle issue that ruled him out of playing at Goodison Park, and Stephen Ireland (knee) looks set to be absent again.

A green light is clearly shone on Bojan as he scores the decisive penalty against Everton

The Potters - now with 51 points for 2014, their best haul for a calendar year since their promotion to the Premier League in 2008 - head into the fixture against 15th-placed West Brom still looking to record back-to-back top-flight victories for the first time this term.

Hughes' men have pulled off some impressive triumphs, beating the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal and Tottenham, but struggled each time to then build upon the result.

The Welshman is optimistic that might change following the Everton contest as his side prepare to host an Albion outfit that have only one win in their last eight league games.

'We have found it difficult to get back-to-back results - that is something that has stalled our season on occasions,' Hughes said.

'We have had really good performances, then stumbled in the next game. So hopefully that won't be the case this time.

'It is difficult for everyone with the quick turnaround, a little bit unfair on everybody really. But we'll make the best of it - we pride ourselves on our fitness levels.'

Meanwhile, Stoke midfielder Glenn Whelan says 'anything could happen' with regard to his contract situation.

Hughes earlier this month said an offer had been made to the Republic of Ireland international, whose current Potters deal runs out next summer, before Whelan himself played down the idea of formal talks having happened.

The 30-year-old player has also said he would like to spend the rest of his career at Stoke.

And, speaking to the club's website, Whelan said: 'There's obviously been one or two things said from both sides, but at the moment anything could happen.

'I've got myself back in the team now and my aim is to stay in so I can prove people right and wrong.

'For me personally, I only have five months left and ideally I want to stay here but if not then I'm playing to go somewhere else.

'We will have to see what happens over the coming weeks and months.'
