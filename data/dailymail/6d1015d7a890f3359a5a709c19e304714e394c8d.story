He said: 'The world was his oyster.

'He has a modelling contract and was about to do some filming in April for a Channel Four series - he was going to be one of the big characters in it.

'He was incredibly fit and loved being active.He was very good looking. He had everything going for him.

'Everywhere we looked he had girls chasing him. He was definitely a bit of a character.

'Grant always wanted to join the Army but that didn't work out because he's injured his breastbone. So he started doing some work for Help for Heroes every Wednesday at the surf lodge.

'We knew he'd been depressed for a while.

'He knew we all loved him so much.'
