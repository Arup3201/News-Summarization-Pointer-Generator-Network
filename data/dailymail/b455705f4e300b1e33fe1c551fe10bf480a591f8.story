Manchester United forward Adnan Januzaj is expected to be loaned out later this transfer window after struggling to be involved in Louis van Gaal first-team plans.

Only last season, Januzaj was being courted by top clubs across Europe and indeed by the England national team after breaking through under previous manager David Moyes.

This time round, however, the 19-year-old has made hardly any impact under Van Gaal and has only been given two starts in the Barclays Premier League all season.

Despite the injuries that have afflicted United this term, Januzaj’s stock has fallen dramatically in the last couple of months. Indeed, he has only made two appearances for United – totaling 27 minutes – since the first week of November.

Januzaj was given 26 minutes in the game at Stoke on New Year’s Day and a solitary minute at the end of United’s win against the same opposition at Old Trafford a month earlier.

Van Gaal has indicated to United chief executive Ed Woodward that Januzaj isn’t in his current plans as he doesn’t think he is suited to the wing-back role and has fallen behind the likes of Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Angel di Maria for the coveted ‘No 10’ position.
