The British Library is to 'harvest' billions of web pages, blogs and e-books in a bid to preserve the nation's 'digital memory'.

For centuries, the library has kept a copy of every book, pamphlet, magazine and newspaper published in Britain.

From Saturday, it will also be bound by new regulations to harvest the entire UK web 
domain to document current events and record the country's burgeoning 
collection of online cultural and intellectual works.

Any reader of MailOnline will know that from the shear volume of stories produced by this website alone, the task at hand is a gargantuan one.

Archiving our online life: This Yahoo homepage from 2010 will not be part of the project which begins on Saturday, nor will the BBC homepage from 2003

The library could eventually collect 
copies of every public Tweet or Facebook page in the British web domain 
as it complies with an Act of Parliament passed 10 years ago.

Lucie
 Burgess, leading the project at the British Library, said the 
unprecedented operation would provide a complete snapshot of life in the
 21st century which increasingly plays out online.

'Stuff out there on the Web is ephemeral,' she said.

Web pages including long-since updated homepages can already be found online thanks to the Internet Archive.

The site, run by a not-for-profit organisation based in San Francisco, aims to offer 'permanent access for researchers, historians, scholars, people with disabilities, and the general public to historical collections that exist in digital format.'

Established in 1996, it receives data 'donations' from analytics firms and has become popularly known as the Way Back Machine.

As well as web pages it contains millions of examples of online text, audio, moving images and software.

And it provides specialised services for blind people and others with disabilities to ensure they can access the history of the web.

'The average life of a web page is only 75 days, because websites change, the contents get taken down.

'If we don't capture this material, a critical piece of the jigsaw puzzle of our understanding of the 21st century will be lost.

'If you want a picture of what life is like today in the UK you have to look at the web,' she said.

'We
 have already lost a lot of material, particularly around events such as
 the 7/7 London bombings or the 2008 financial crisis.

'That material has fallen into the digital black hole of the 21st century because we haven't been able to capture it.

'The social media reaction has gone.'

The
 operation to 'capture the digital universe' will begin with an 
automatic 'web harvest' of an initial 4.8million websites - or one 
billion web pages - from the UK domain, she said.

This will start tomorrow and is expected to take three months.

It will then take another two months to process the data.

Lucie Burgess, head of content strategy, announced that the British Library is to 'harvest' the UK web domain to preserve it alongside newspapers and magazines in its archive

'We
 will have to distinguish between content published in the UK and 
elsewhere but in principle we will be able to archive the publicly 
available tweets of any individual, company or organisation,' Ms Burgess
 said.

'We'll be collecting
 in a single year what it took 300 years for us to collect in our 
newspaper archive,' which holds 750 million pages of newsprint.

The library plans to make the content publicly available by the end of this year.

Until now the British Library could only preserve a relatively small handful of websites.

The
 2003 Legal Deposit Library Act paved the way for the information to be 
stored but copyright laws forced the library to seek permission each 
time it wanted to collect web content.

Under
 the new regulations - which extend to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, 
Cambridge University Library, the National Library of Scotland, the 
National Library of Wales and Trinity College Library in Dublin - it has
 the right to receive a copy of every UK electronic publication. 

A year of collecting web material will produce the equivalent of what it took 300 years to amass in the library's newspaper archive, Ms Burgess said

Roly Keating, chief executive of the 
British Library, said: 'Ten years ago, there was a very real danger of a
 black hole opening up and swallowing our digital heritage, with 
millions of web pages, e-publications and other non-print items falling 
through the cracks of a system that was devised primarily to capture ink
 and paper.

'The Legal 
Deposit Libraries Act established in 2003 the principle that legal 
deposit needed to evolve to reflect the massive shift to digital forms 
of publishing.

'The regulations now coming into force
 make digital legal deposit a reality, and ensure that the Legal Deposit
 Libraries themselves are able to evolve - collecting, preserving and 
providing long-term access to the profusion of cultural and intellectual
 content appearing online or in other digital formats."

The
 British Library, which has invested Â£3million in the project during the
 past two years, plans to collect the material by conducting an annual 
trawl of the UK web domain - every website ending with '.uk'.

It
 will harvest information from another 200 sites - such as online 
newspapers or journals - on a more regular basis, as often as once a 
day.

Access to the material, including archived websites, will be offered in reading rooms at each of the legal deposit libraries.

Culture
 Minister Ed Vaizey said: 'Legal deposit arrangements remain vitally 
important. Preserving and maintaining a record of everything that has 
been published provides a priceless resource for the researchers of 
today and the future.

The web pages will join the British Library's existing 150million items in its archive

'So it's right that these long-standing arrangements have now been brought up to date for the 21st century, covering the UK's digital publications for the first time.'

Britain is one of the first countries to commit in law to capturing its entire digital domain.

The challenge is not just saving the material, but preserving it.

The British Library, which has a collection of 150million items as much as 3,000 years old, says it wants researchers in future centuries to have access to the content.

But anticipating changing technology can be tricky - some years ago it was suggested the library's vast collection should be saved to CD-ROM.

To ensure the collection doesn't decay, there will be multiple self-replicating copies on servers around the country and staff will transfer files into updated formats as technology evolves.
