The 42-year-old former lawyer has been nicknamed 'Ms U-turn' after she softened the Government's approach to the teaching unions and performed a spectacular climbdown on gay marriage

Controversial Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will keep her job if the Tories win the election, the Prime Minister revealed yesterday.

David Cameron said Mrs Morgan will be put in charge of plans to create 500 new free schools, which he claimed would drive up standards across the country.

He said the schools – which can be set up by parents, faith groups or other organisations – were helping to wrest control of education out of the hands of 'pointy-heads in Whitehall'. 

He claimed the Tories are 'the only party that is opening up the education system so we can get more good places for your children', adding: 'With me as Prime Minister and Nicky Morgan as Education Secretary, that's exactly what you're going to get.' 

Mrs Morgan is said to be 'delighted' to be the first Cabinet minister to be guaranteed her job if her party wins in May.

But the move will alarm critics, who have accused her of watering down the radical approach to schools reform taken by her predecessor, Michael Gove. 

The 42-year-old former lawyer has been nicknamed 'Ms U-turn' after she softened the Government's approach to the teaching unions and performed a spectacular climbdown on gay marriage, which she opposed before joining the Cabinet.

But friends say she is only carrying out Downing Street's orders to mend fences with the teaching establishment, which Mr Gove derided as 'the Blob'.

A Tory source said last night: 'The Prime Minister is a big fan of Nicky Morgan – he thinks she is doing a good job.'

The Education Secretary confirmed that a future Tory government would not allow free schools to make a profit – an idea that was floated by Mr Gove but blocked by the Lib Dems.

Free schools legislation allows groups to establish new state-funded schools which are independent of local authorities. As with academies, they do not have to teach the National Curriculum.

Fewer than 300 have been opened to date, although 49 were given the green light yesterday. Labour has claimed it would not allow any more to open – and warned existing free schools could be placed under some form of local authority control.

But Mr Cameron said a Tory-led government would open 500 new free schools after the election. Speaking at an academy in West London yesterday, he hailed the reforms as 'the most successful schools programme in recent British history'.

He also insisted he is not trying to block controversial plans to allow a grammar school in Kent to expand by opening an 'annexe' in another town, saying: 'Grammar schools are good schools and I like good schools.

'Like other schools, if they are good, and want to expand, they should be able to.'

Mrs Morgan is expected to take legal advice in the coming days on whether she can approve the expansion of the Weald of Kent Grammar School in Tonbridge, which wants to open a new site nine miles away in Sevenoaks.
