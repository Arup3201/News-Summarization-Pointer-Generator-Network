A female motorcyclist was dramatically saved from burning to death after witnesses pulled off her trousers which had caught alight when her motorbike crashed and turned into a fireball.

Shocking footage of the incident shows the female biker driving along a busy carriageway in Guangdong, China, when she is clipped by a passing lorry.

The bike can be seen spinning out of control before bursting into flames as it flips over on to the hard shoulder.

As the bikes comes to a rest, the motorcyclist can be seen lying in the middle of the road.

But as she gets up, it becomes clear her trousers have caught alight.

The motorcyclist quickly runs to bushes at the side of the road where she attempts to drop and roll to put out the flames.

Three witnesses then run to her aid and can be seen ripping the burning trousers from her legs.

Miraculously, the driver apparently escaped unharmed.
