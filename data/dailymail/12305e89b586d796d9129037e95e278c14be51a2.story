Every day for 71 years, great-grandfather Ted Ingram has tirelessly delivered newspapers to the all the houses in his village.

But the world's oldest paperboy has reluctantly decided to hang up his bag after delivering more than 500,000 papers in Winterborne Monkton near Dorchester, Dorset, because his knees have finally given up on him.

The 93-year-old took up the part-time job when he was 22 years old to earn extra pocket money but loved it so much he never gave it up.

Tireless: The world's oldest paper boy Ted Ingram, 93, will hang up his bag this weekend. He has delivered more than 500,000 papers since he began the round in 1942 (pictured right)

The pensioner was officially recognised by the Guinness World Records three years ago after doing the job for more than seven decades, but he has chosen to retire and will drop his final paper into a letterbox this Saturday.

Mr Ingram, who began the job in 1942, said: 'I've really enjoyed my time as a paperboy and have had so much fun.

'I'm so proud of my round and would still carry on if I could but I have bad knees and struggle now.

'I would say to anyone thinking of taking up a paper round that it's a great way to get out and keep fit and active.

Retirement: He has reluctantly decided to stop because his knees have given up on him

Married: Mr Ingram with his wife Betty in the late 1940s

'My retirement plans are to have fun and enjoy myself, as well as just to relax.

'I'm looking forward to still seeing all the friends I've made along the way around the village.'

Mr Ingram started doing the round to top up his income as a tractor driver on a farm, and delivered the newspaper to 26 houses in the village on his bike.

Incredibly, there have only been two days in the last 70 years when his customers have failed to receive their papers - and that was when bad snow storms prevented the copies from reaching him.

He has only ever had two holidays, both of which were in the 1960s when he took his family to Butlins.

But he ensured the people on his route would not miss out on their daily paper by getting a neighbour to look after his round each time.

Setback: He had to stop cycling a few years ago after having a hip replacement and now gets a lift around the village during his round

Not stopping: He was still going strong when he was 80-years-old in 2000

And even when he broke his back in the 1950s he arranged for his late wife Betty to deliver the papers in their village while he was recovering.

Mr Ingram was forced to stop cycling a few years ago after having a hip replacement and now gets a lift around the village so he can do his round.

He added: 'When I first started the wages at the farm weren't very good so I thought I would do the paper round to boost up my money.

Family: Mr Ingram with his daughter Valerie and dog Laddie in 1957. He has two children, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren

Exercise: The great-grandfather encouraged others to take up a round, suggesting it was a great way to stay healthy and get outdoors

'Back in those days there were 26 houses to deliver to and it took me next to no time.'

Mr Ingram has two children, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. His wife Betty died 15 years ago.

His daughter, Angela Matthews, 53, from Martinstown, near Dorchester, said the family were very proud of him.

She said: 'It's just so good that he has done the paper round for so long.

'Delivering papers has been a family tradition and most of my family have helped out from time to time.

'My father is such a character and I cannot express how proud we all are of him.'

Pocket money: Mr Ingram, pictured in 1950, took on the round to top up the income he got from driving a tractor

Farewell: Mr Ingram will deliver his final paper on Saturday he is looking forward to relaxing in retirement
