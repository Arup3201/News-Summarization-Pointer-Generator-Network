Eurostar has raised a glass – 515 of them, to be exact – to kick off its 20th anniversary celebrations as a high-speed rail link between London, Paris and Brussels.

The company’s inaugural journey took place on 14 November 1994 and to kick off the countdown to its milestone birthday it set a Guinness World Record on Thursday for the largest champagne tasting event.

Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc, who works with Eurostar’s kitchens to create seasonal menus, led 515 passengers through the tasting on board the 10:25 train from London St Pancras to Paris Gare du Nord.

Travellers in all classes were served three types of champagne and a slice of opera cake – setting the record on UK soil – after they were surprised by Mr Blanc at the start of their two-hour journey.

He hosted the tasting with Arnaud Goubet, his sommelier from  Belmond Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons in Oxford.

Marc Noaro, Eurostar’s service and people director, said additional events and promotions will take place in Eurostar stations in the coming weeks.

He added: ‘Today marked the start of our 20th anniversary celebrations and we’re delighted to have shared this special occasion with our passengers who joined in the festivities and set a new Guinness World Record title.

Twenty years and counting: Eurostar made its inaugural journey on on 14 November 1994

‘With a leap in passenger numbers to 145 million, as well as the introduction of new routes and new destinations, there are plenty of reasons to celebrate this year.’

Eurostar previously announced plans to expand to Amsterdam, Lyon and Marseille. 

Since the inaugural journey 20 years ago, Eurostar’s fleet of 28 trains has carried more than 145 million passengers.

The tasting was held on board the 10:25 train from London St Pancras to Paris Gare du Nord

The current train model was introduced in 1994 and can carry 750 passengers with a top speed of 186 mph, but the company’s new Siemens AG e320 trains will carry around 900 passengers at speeds of up to 200 mph once they enter service.

When it began service, Eurostar was a partnership between three government-owned railway companies: SNCF, SNCB and LCR (London and Continental Railways).

Eurostar became a single, unified corporate entity owned by the three railway companies on 1 September 2010.
