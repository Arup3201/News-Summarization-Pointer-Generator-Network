Maryland Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings' nephew Christopher was found murdered at age 20 in his home near Old Dominion University in Virginia two years ago, shot in the head. Cummings said Tuesday during a news conference at the National Press Club that Congress has moved too slowly to pass new gun-control measures.

One place Congress should act, he said, is with a law criminalizing so-called 'straw purchasers' of firearms. 'Most Americans already think gun trafficking is a federal crime,' he said, 'but it's not.

Straw purchasers are individuals who buy guns with the intention of selling them or giving them to others - often to individuals who would not pass background checks administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

Straw purchasing was an element of the Newtown, Connecticut gun massacre in December that left 20 children and six adults dead at the Sandy Hook Elementary School.

Mass-murderer Adam Lanza obtained his weapons from his mother, who reportedly bought them legally. It's unclear if he would have qualified to buy firearms himself, but his history of mental illness, experts say, would have made it unlikely.

Straw purchasing, however, was also an element of the Obama administration's effort to fight drug trafficking along the US-Mexico border. In Operation Fast and Furious, the Justice Department and the ATF used straw purchasers to 'walk' guns into Mexico in an ultimately failed effort to track them to drug cartels.

The government lost track of those guns, more than 2 thousand of them, including AK-47 rifles. And the Fast and Furious firearms have been linked to hundreds of death in Mexico, and to the death of at least one US Border Patrol Agent, Brian Terry.

Cummings said his bill would put the federal government out of the straw-purchasing business.

'Yeah.
 In other words, it was wrong,' he said of Fast and Furious when asked by MailOnline.' I think 
everybody agrees that was wrong. And yes, the legislation would address 
that issue.'

Cummings has 
introduced the Gun Trafficking Prevention Act of 2013, legislation that 
would increase the penalties for straw-purchasing guns to a maximum of 
20 years. 'Bipartisan support for the legislation is growing every day,'
 he said.

Vendetta: Cummings thinks that lawmakers should go after 'straw purchasers' of guns

Surveys show that nine out of ten Americans, and a majority of National Rifle Association members, support universal background checks for gun buyers, a measure that would be part of a strategy to limit straw purchasing.

'I believe fixing the background check system is one of the most common-sense actions we can take to prevent criminals from getting guns,' Cummings explained. 'And I think it would complement our gun trafficking legislation as well.

'I will fight for that legislation until I die,' an emotional Cummings told reporters.

‘This is about moving the ball up the floor. I don’t know if we’ll score 2 points or 3 points.’

The NRA has been critical of gun control legislation, and gun-rights advocates have pointed out that Cummings' nephew was unarmed and in his home when he was killed. Greater freedom to own his own gun, they say, could have saved his life.

NRA lobbyists are hard at work lobbying in the Senate to scuttle much of the White House's preferred legislative package, The Washington Post
 reported Tuesday, by circulating new and weaker bill language to 
senators. That language would use stricter evidentiary requirements for 
prosecuting straw purchasers in federal court than what Cummings 
prefers.

'I think it basically waters down the bill tremendously.' But 'they're not solid on that language, Apparently it's a draft.'

During a Q-and-A from reporters, Cummings resisted every opportunity to criticize the gun lobby for undermining his efforts, aware that the organization would hold a press conference just down the hall when his concluded.

'You won't hear me beating up on the NRA. I want to work with the NRA to get something meaningful done,' he said.

But Cummings is dead-set against allowing straw purchasing among ordinary US citizens.

'There are only two groups,' he said of his new legislation 'who should oppose this bill: criminals and people who want to buy guns for criminals.'

Baltimore and the surrounding counties that Cummings represents have been hot spots for firearms violence, but it has what an analysis by The Daily Beast found is the 7th most aggressive state-level gun laws in the country.

'He was an amazing young man with his entire life ahead of him,' he said of his nephew, then a criminal justice major. 'It is a painful thing to see your nephew, son or daughter's blood splattered across the wall.'

Asked if he would support the NRA's proposal, expected Tuesday morning, to arm a greater number of security guards in US schools, Cummings left room for negotiation.

'Having more guns in schools, I don't think, is necessarily the answer,' he said. 'But any jurisdiction that wants to take care of its kids that way, it's students - I don't think that's necessarily a bad proposal.'
