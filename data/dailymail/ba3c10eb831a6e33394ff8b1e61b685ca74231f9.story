When morbidly obese Dave Beevers’ wife Diane told him her dying wish was for him to lose weight he vowed he would turn his life round.

For forty years he’d never exercised and had lived on an unhealthy diet of curries, chips, pizzas and chocolate.

Now, just over a year since he lost his wife to Breast Cancer, he is a changed man. Dave has shed nearly ten stone and admits he is now hooked on running.

Next month, on April 13th, he will run the Rotterdam Marathon in her memory and he says every time he runs, he feels her alongside him.

And he knows she will be looking down with pride when he runs the race in the city where she was born, aiming to raise  £100,000 for Breast Cancer Care.

Dave, 58, from Bolton, said: 'Diane’s dying wish was for me to lose weight. She said to me, "You can’t carry on as you are. You’ve got to be here for the dogs."

'It broke my heart. Our two dogs, Cassie and Bonnie were our world. I knew I had to change as they couldn’t lose their mum and their dad.'

Diane died of metastatic breast cancer in February last year aged 71 after six years of treatment including a mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and tablets.

When she came off her five-year course of medication last November, both she and Dave believed they had beaten the disease and started making plans for the future.

Then last Christmas, Diane complained of feeling unwell and after a few weeks her condition worsened.

She was rushed to hospital where scan revealed the cancer had returned with a vengeance. She died just six days after being admitted.

Dave said: 'I just felt numb. I sat there in a side room on the ward and couldn't take it in. It seemed like one minute she was there and we were making plans and the next minute she was gone.

'I felt not just alone, I felt vulnerable and alone. After her funeral I realised how much in bad shape I was.'

At the time, Dave, who is 6ft 3in, tipped the scales at 24st, giving him BMI of 42 which made him morbidly obese. He had Type 2 diabetes and could barely walk up stairs.

'I was in a terrible way and I’d been in denial about my health for many years. But losing Diane made me realise I had to change.

'I wasn't going to become the sad, lonely, fat old man in the corner house. I was determined to reinvent myself and make Diane proud.

Before losing weight Dave had trouble even walking up the stairs and had a BMI of 42

'Not only that, I also wanted to do something to help others going through what me and Diane had. I wanted her death to make a difference.'

True to his word, after Diane's death Dave wasted no time ans sprung into action in order to fulfill his wife's final wish.

'Two months after I lost her, I joined Smith Hills Sports Centre, my local gym, to get fit. At first, I couldn’t even walk for a minute on the treadmill.

'But the staff there were lovely and supportive and I was determined I would run. I signed up for the City of Salford 5K in September, and I told myself I would complete it.

'It was very much one step at a time, and a walk became a run and each time I’d try to go that little bit longer.

'After a few months I ventured outside, running round my local park, which was just one kilometre.

'Then I built it up and up, so I’d be ready for the race that day. I also asked friends and family to sponsor me and raised £1600 for Breast Cancer Care which really spurred me on.'

Since losing nearly ten stone, Dave's diabetes is now classed as dormant

Dave says that he has become addicted to running and has started his own blog - Running with Diane

Dave, a newspaper editor, also changed his diet dramatically. Before, he’d had a fry-up for breakfast, mid-morning snacks of crisps or chocolate, a lunch from the chip shop or curry house then pie and chips when he got home.

He even admitted to eating the occasional sandwich whilst cooking his dinner.

Now it’s strictly porridge or scrambled egg whites for breakfast, a protein shake mid-morning, a salad for lunch, a piece of fruit mid-afternoon and a main meal of chicken or oily fish plus vegetables for dinner.

'Diane’s dying wish was for me to lose 
weight. She said to me, "You can’t carry on as you are. You’ve got to be
 here for the dogs."'

Dave now weighs just over 15st, has dropped seven shirt sizes and lost eight inches around his waist and hopes to reach his 14st target for the 26.2 mile race.

He explained: 'I stopped the biscuits, pastries, ready meals, pizzas, curries and cheese. I love them all but they're just not compatible with what I was trying to achieve.

'That's not to say I haven't eaten those things in the last 12 months but just as occasional treats and I feel guilty afterwards.

'Instead I now eat slow release carbs like porridge, yams, granary bread, wholewheat pasta, brown rice and more fruit and veg.'

Dave said that losing the weight has also been beneficial to his diabetes too.

'Not
 only have I lost the weight, but I also feel more energised and better 
mentally too. My diabetes is now classed as dormant, so I have the same 
blood sugar levels as most people.'

Dave has already completed several 10km 
runs and half marathons in Preston and Lancaster and aims to do the 
Rotterdam Marathon on April 13th in under five hours.

He said: 'We wanted to go before Diane passed away but the cancer returned and we never made it there.

'But I have been there since. I see it as the place where she learned to be the wonderful woman she was, and have met her friends who will be there to support me on the day.

'I am not a runner, never have been. But I have become passionate about it, something that I never dreamed would happen, and the only reason I can think of is that Diane has decided I needed to make a difference.'

To support his fund-raising, he has started the online community blog Running With Diane at runningwithdiane.blogspot.co.uk and on Twitter @runwithdiane.

Dave said of his blog: 'Those three words sum up how I feel when I’m running. I didn't want people to say I was running 'in her memory' or 'for' her.

'To me, I was running with her. She is my inspiration and driving force. I know the marathon will be tough, but when I need to dig deep, I will think of her.

'Every time I run, she runs with me. We have done everything together for over 20 years. Why should now be any different?

'Cancer's not beaten her. It took her body but it couldn't touch what made her special. We'll always have that. Especially when we're running together.'
