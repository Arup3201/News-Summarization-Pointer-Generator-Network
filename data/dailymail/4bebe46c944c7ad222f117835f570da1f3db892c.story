The First World War saw millions of men separated from their families and sent to the front line but very few were pitted against their relations.

For the royals, however, World War I truly was a family affair.

A new documentary has revealed how the roots of the Great War lay partly in the tangled web of Royal family relationships - in particular that of the British-hating Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and his cousins, George V and Tsar Nicholas of Russia.

Best of enemies: Kaiser Wilhelm II (L) and King Edward VII loathed each other despite being nephew and uncle

Wilhelm, the eldest of the three and the owner of a withered arm thanks to his traumatic birth, was notoriously difficult and had a strained relationship with his English mother, Victoria or 'Vicky' as she was known to friends and family.

In the BBC documentary, Royal Cousins at War, the story of how the young Wilhelm's hatred of his parents, and all things Biritsh, in part, brought about the beginning of the First World War is told.

His mother Vicky was only 17 when she married Prussia’s dashing Crown Prince Friedrich, known as Fritz, in 1858.

It was a passionate love match that also fulfilled the dynastic dreams of her German father Prince Albert. But her first pregnancy almost ended in disaster, after she underwent a traumatic breech delivery.

A Caesarean – too dangerous at the time – was out of the question and the future Kaiser Wilhelm II had to be wrenched forcefully into the world. Three days later, a nursemaid noticed that his damaged left arm hung limply at his side - much to his mother's horror.

'It cuts me to the heart when I see all 
other children with the use of all their limbs and that mine is denied 
that,' she wrote in an anguished letter to her mother.

'The thought of him remaining a cripple haunts me. I long to have a
 child where everything is perfect about it just like everybody else.'

Family feud: George V (pictured front centre) was no more keen on Kaiser Wilhelm than his father had been

Mothers: Princess Victoria, mother of Kaiser Wilhelm (L) and Tsarina Dagmar and Queen Alexandra (R)

'This is the story of a proud mother who reacts really badly to her 
son's handicap,' explains Dr Karina Urbach of the University of London.

'She tries to love him and tries to be a good mother but 
at the end of the day, she looks at him and sees a failure.'

By contrast, Wilhelm's cousins, the future Tsar Nicholas and George V, were adored by their mothers, Alexandra and Dagmar - a pair of Danish royal sisters who married into two of Europe's most powerful dynasties.

Theirs was a shared childhood with summers spent enjoying family breaks in Denmark at the home of their grandfather, Christian IX.

Both were taught to mistrust the Prussians - later Germans - by their mothers, furious at Germany's annexation of Schleswig-Holstein, formerly a Danish possession, in 1864.

Both were also in awe of their fathers, Edward VII and Tsar Alexander III, and became fast friends as a result.

Childhood: Tsar Nicholas II and George V met during family holidays in Denmark and remained close friends

Firm friends: Tsar Nicholas II and King George V were cousins and close friends thanks to their mothers

Alexandra, pictured with Edward VII and their son Albert, hated Germany after its conquest of parts of Denmark

Peacemaker: Queen Victoria, pictured with Kaiser Wilhelm, his mother and Edward VII kept the family united

Wilhelm, however, proved less than popular with his British and Russian extended family; not least because of the treatment he meted out to his mother.

As a teenager, he wrote strange  - almost sexually charged - letters to his mother Princess Victoria in which he described dreams of kissing 
her hands and caressing her.

'Promise to do to me as I did in my dream to you. I love you so much,' the future German monarch wrote in one epistle.

But when she replied speaking only of art and politics, the already tortured relationship continued to worsen.

And when his father died in March 1888, his behaviour towards his mother was so shocking, it damaged relations with his uncle Edward VII forever.

Upon becoming Kaiser, Wilhelm's first
 act was to have troops to surround the palace where his father died on the pretext of searching for
 for papers relating to his father's reign.

But his ire was really directed at his mother, as her furious brother was only too well aware.

At odds: In contrast to his close relationship with George V, Nicholas II found Kaiser Wilhelm difficult

Troubled: Kaiser Wilhelm (pictured aged 4 at Balmoral and later in Berlin) had an unhappy childhood

Not close: Although related twice over, Tsar Nicholas II and Kaiser Wilhelm were not close friends

In a letter written to his sister shortly after her husband's death, Edward wrote: 'His conduct towards you is simply revolting. His manners are not those of a gentleman.'

But the family feuding came at a price: as relationships between the royal cousins waxed and waned, so did the relationships between their countries.

Aware of the dangerous possibilities, one woman did attempt to broker peace: Queen Victoria, the family matriarch.

Respected and listened to by all, even by her notoriously unstable 
grandson Wilhelm, the British Empress played peacemaker and ensured her
 family - and their respective nations - maintained good relationships.

Family: Like George V, Nicholas II was devoted to his wife, a favourite grandchild of Queen Victoria

Tragedy: George V and Nicholas II remained close after their respective enthronements and until the end

Wilhelm, in particular, adored her. But it couldn't last. In 1901, when it became clear she was dying, the Kaiser rushed to be with her.

When she died, it was in his arms and he helped to lay out her body. At her funeral, he rode behind her casket alongside his uncle Edward VII.

But with Victoria gone, peace between the Russian, British and German branches of the family dissipated and Europe edged closer to war: George V and Tsar Nicholas on one side, and their estranged cousin, Wilhelm, on the other.
