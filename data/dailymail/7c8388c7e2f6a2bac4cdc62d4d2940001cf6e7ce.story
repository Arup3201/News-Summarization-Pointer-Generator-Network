Howard Webb has been our No 1 referee for the last eight years, representing England abroad.

Four major championships is an incredible feat, as is being the first referee in modern times to return to a World Cup having officiated a final.

Howard is the most successful English referee in living memory and he has followed his idol Pierluigi Collina by becoming a real ambassador for refereeing across the world.

No 1: Howard Webb has been the best referee in England for the last eight years

Retired: Webb has ended his distinguished career and will become a technical director with Professional Game Match Officials Limited

Distinguished: Webb has taken charge of more than 500 matches in the PRemier League and Football League

Howard had his troubles, like all of us, with fans saying he favoured Manchester United.

Liverpool’s Ryan Babel once put a picture of him in a United shirt on Twitter. But he was the top referee and they were the top team, so they earned more decisions. He’s a big fan of Rotherham United, of course.

He often made light of the criticism at functions he would speak at. ‘When pictures show me in a Man United shirt, my wife Kay and I get very upset,’ he would say. ‘And our kids, Rio and Wayne.’

Now he has nothing left to prove and can spend more time with his family.

Yet he is held in high regard by the FA and FIFA, and no doubt both bodies will want him to perform a role for them in future.

Standard bearers: Webb and Pierluigi Collina (pictured) have become ambassadors for referring around the world

International standard: Webb has been selected for two World Cups and two European Championships
