A woman accused of hiring a hit man to kill her wealthy husband has told an extradition hearing that she is innocent and the victim of 'the Mafia and corruption' .

Puerto Rico national Aurea Vazquez Rijos is wanted by US federal authorities after she allegedly offered a man $3milllion to kill her Canadian husband Adam Anhang.

Mr Anhang, 32, was beaten and stabbed to death in Puerto Rico in 2005 as he walked with Vazquez close to a bar he had bought for her.

Plea: Aurea Vazquez Rijos is facing extradition to the US after she was accused of hiring a hit man to kill her rich husband Adam Anhang. The 33-year-old is pictured during the hearing in Madrid

Back in better times: Aurea Vazquez Rijos is wanted by US federal authorities after she allegedly offered a man $3milllion to kill her Canadian husband Adam Anhang

At today's hearing in Madrid, 33-year-old Vazquez claimed she was not aware that she was wanted by US authorities until she arrived in Spain, having lived legally in Italy since 2008.

The blonde said that she was at risk of being given the death penalty, despite the fact that, according to her, there was no case against her.

As a US Caribbean territory, residents of Puerto Rico are US citizens. Although they can not vote in US presidential elections and do not pay federal income tax, they are subject to US federal laws and can be sentenced to death.

Puerto Rico's government has requested that federal prosecutors stop 
seeking the death penalty in Puerto Rico, and that juries 
in the country have rejected death penalty cases six times in recent history.

Vazquez was arrested in Madrid in June, after flying to Spain from Italy.

Anhang developed seaside hotels and apartment blocks in Puerto Rico as well as serving as CEO of a Costa Rica-based online gambling software company

In 2008, the year she moved to Italy, she was indicted by a US grand jury following the accusations that she had hired a hitman to kill wealthy Mr Anhang, who  had developed seaside hotels and apartment blocks in Puerto Rico as well as serving
 as CEO of a Costa Rica-based online gambling software company.

Back then, Vazquez refused to cooperate with police and filed a civil 
lawsuit against Anhang's family, seeking $1million in damages and 
millions more from his estate. A judge in Puerto Rico dismissed the 
suit.

Alex Pabon Colon has since been charged with the killing and pleaded guilty, cooperating with investigators.

Several 
others, including members of Vazquez's family, have been arrested and 
charged in the case.

The Spanish National Court is expected to rule on the extradition within the next three weeks.

Vazquez said she had an Italian residence permit, and had given birth to twins by another man while living in the country.

She also told the hearing that she worked as a tourist guide and had travelled frequently in Europe, adding that she had her American passport renewed in Italy last year.

She asked the court how she could have done all of this if there had been an arrest warrant out for her, and claimed that when she flew to Madrid in June she was duped into thinking she was to meet a group of tourists.

She said she was arrested as she stepped off the plane.

'There is an act of the Mafia and corruption behind all of this,' she told the hearing.

Vazquez's lawyer, Isaac Abad Gomez, argued against the extradition, saying there was no guarantee that Vazquez would not face life imprisonment without parole should she be handed over to US authorities.

He also said the arrest order was faulty.

Questionable: Vazquez refused to cooperate with police and filed a civil lawsuit against Anhang's family, seeking $1million in damages and millions more from his estate

Spanish law does not permit the extradition of people who could face the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole.

However, the Spanish prosecutor said he favored extradition as long as there were guarantees that Vazquez would not face either of these two punishments.

The defendant wept as she was handcuffed from behind and led away from the courtroom.

The murder victim's father, Abe Anhang, said he was happy his former daughter-in-law had been detained.

'Our family is most grateful for the efforts of the FBI, Interpol and the Spanish police for apprehending her, and to the courts in Spain for dealing with this so efficiently, ' said Mr Anhang senior, who lives in Winnipeg, Canada.

'After eight years, we are looking forward to justice and closure.'
