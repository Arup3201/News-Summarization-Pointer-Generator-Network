A sick puppy that was thrown into a dumpster by owners who 'thought he was dead' has fully recovered and found a new home.

The chihuahua named Trooper was taken to his new abode Wednesday, about two weeks after he was found whimpering and seriously unwell in a trash bin in Wells, Nevada.

Sheriff's deputies responded to the Flying J gas station in Wells on August 30 after an employee found the puppy there.

A new beginning: Trooper wags his tail in the arms of his new owner, D.J. Smith, after being found seriously ill with parvovirus in a dumpster

A deputy located the owners - a couple whose RV had broken down.

They said they thought the puppy was dead and callously decided to throw Trooper in the dumpster.Inside the 
couple's RV, deputies found a pungent mess of dog feces and flies as 
well as 35 dogs.

The couple allowed eight unhealthy adult dogs to be 
taken to the Elko Animal Shelter.

Incredibly, the 
original owners were not arrested or cited as there was no way to know 
whether the puppy actually appeared dead when it was tossed in the 
garbage, according to Undersheriff Clair Morris.

The puppy was brought for emergency care to the Elko Veterinary Clinic and diagnosed with parvovirus, an infectious disease that is often fatal for dogs.

'I heard about the story and knew I had to do something,' D.J. Smith, who adopted Trooper, told the Elko Daily Free Press.

'You can't just let something go like that.'

Local dog lovers Park and Del Blair contributed more than $500 to save the animal's life, said Elko Animal Shelter Manager Karen Walther.

'I didn't think he would have made it,' Walther said.

'For an animal to be that sick and to have that much heart, I'm happy as a lark. He's been doted on here [at the shelter] and everyone's been cheering for him after what he's been through.'

'Time to meet the family,' Smith told Trooper as he carried him out of the shelter, along with two other chihuahuas that needed rescuing, to his new home.
