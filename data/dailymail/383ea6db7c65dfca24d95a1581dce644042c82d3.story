This is the horrific moment two armed robbers shoot a father and son dead during a struggle on a packed bus in Ecuador.

Around 20 passengers including a mother with a child carrying a balloon in his hands fled to safety as the pair ambushed their victims after they left a bank with nearly £12,000 from the sale of a van.

Jose Changoluisa, 63, and his son Fernando, 33, died of gunshot wounds after being pistol-whipped by their attackers as they tried to resist.

This horrific footage shows the moment two armed robbers shot a father and son on a packed bus

Cameras on the bus captured the violent scenes, including the moment Jose was shot twice in the back as other passengers screamed in horror and the bullets tore his T-shirt open.

He collapsed and died shortly after rushing to the aid of his dying son who was dragged off the bus by the well-built robbers, still clutching onto the bag despite his injuries.

A camera in the driver's cab recorded the anguishing moments Jose - his T-shirt ripped and covered in blood - climbs off the bus to tend to his dying son lying on the blood-stained cobbled street before collapsing exhausted on the pavement nearby.

Shocked passers-by stopped but could do little to help as the attackers had already fled with the money

The attack happened in Amaguana, a village near the capital Quito.

A post-mortem showed Jose received three bullet wounds and his son six, including four to the head.

The attackers ambushed the victims who bravely tried to stop the pair from stealing nearly £12,000 from the sale of a van

Police have arrested six people including three men who helped the robbers make their getaway on motorbikes.

The suspects included an escaped prisoner jailed for the murder of a boxer.

Relatives of the victims said the cash the pair were carrying came from the sale of a van and they were going to use it to pay off a debt.
