Shoe trouble: Part of Imelda Marcos' shoe collection, left behind after she and her dictator husband were driven out of the Philippines, has been badly damaged by termites, floods and general neglect

She is famous for amassing a prized shoe collection that most women would kill for.

But part of Imelda Marcos' shoe stash, left behind after she and her dictator husband were driven out of the Philippines, has been badly damaged by termites, floods and general neglect, officials said today.

The Marcoses fled the Philippines at 
the climax of the army-backed 'people power' revolt in 1986 and left behind staggering amounts 
of personal belongings, clothes and art objects at the palace, including
 at least 1,220 pairs of the former first lady's shoes.

Among the damaged shoes are a pair of white Pierre Cardin heels, the sole of one destroyed by termites.  Other shoes have
 been warped out of shape or messed by stains.

Hundreds of pieces of late strongman 
Ferdinand Marcos' clothing, including the formal native see-through 
Barong shirts he wore during his two-decade rule, have also begun to 
gather mould and fray after being stored for years without protection at 
the presidential palace and Manila's National Museum, officials added.

Ironically, more than 150 boxes of 
clothes, dress accessories and shoes of the Marcoses were transferred to
 the National Museum for safekeeping two years ago after termites, 
humidity and mould threatened the apparel at the riverside palace.

There they deteriorated further as the 
fragile boxes were abandoned in a padlocked museum hall that had no 
facilities to protect them. Last month the pieces were further damaged 
by tropical storm rains from a gushing leak in the ceiling, museum 
officials said.

Mould: Among the damaged shoes in the former First Lady's collection were these white Pierre Cardin heels

Damage: Ironically more than 150 boxes of clothes, dresses and shoes of the Marcoses were transferred to Manila's National Museum for safekeeping two years ago but were damaged in a flood last month

Lost relics: As well as shoes, long gowns, known as 'Terno', once worn by Imelda Marcos, are among the items to be damaged

Museum staffers, who were not aware the boxes contained precious mementoes from the Marcoses, opened the hall on the fourth floor of the building after noticing water pouring out from under the door. They were shocked to see Marcos' shoes and gowns when they opened the wet boxes, officials said.

Workers hurriedly moved the boxes to a dry room and some were later brought to a museum laboratory, where a small team of curators scrambled to assess the extent of the damage, a process that may take months given the huge volume of the apparel.

Some items have obviously been damaged by termites and mould beyond repair, according to museum curator Orlando Abinion, who is heading the effort.

Impressive: Just some of the 3,000 plus shoes in the former First Lady's collection

'We're doing a conservation rescue,' Abinion said. 'There was termite infestation and mould in past years, and these were aggravated by last month's storm.

'It's unfortunate because Imelda may have worn some of these clothes in major official events and as such have an important place in our history,' he said.

Imelda Marcos, now a member of the House of Representatives, was not immediately available for comment Sunday.

Shoe lover: Imelda Marcos' shoe collection became a symbol of excess in the Southeast Asian nation. Her love of shoes extended to other objects as well, as this 1999 picture, right, of her shoe-shaped telephone shows

Extravagant: Imelda Marcos, seen left in 1970 leaving Claridges in London to meet the Queen and right dropping off her son at school in England, claimed many of her shoes were gifts from Filipino shoemakers in suburban Marikina city, the country's shoe-making capital

The 83-year-old's massive shoe collection, said to be in the region of 3,000 pairs, including top U.S. and European brands, astounded the world and became a symbol of excess in the Southeast Asian nation, where many still walked barefoot out of abject poverty.

After the 1986 revolt, Aquino had Imelda Marcos' shoes displayed at the presidential palace as a symbol of the former first lady's lavish lifestyle. The shoes were then removed from public view and stored in the palace basement when Aquino stepped down in 1992.

Imelda Marcos claimed many of the shoes were gifts from Filipino shoemakers in suburban Marikina city, the country's shoemaking capital, for endorsing their products.

Death: Mrs Marcos' husband Ferdinand Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in 1989

Wrecked: Hundreds of pieces of the late Ferdinand Marcos' 
clothing, including his formal native Barong shirts, have also begun to 
gather mould and fray after being stored at the 
presidential palace and National Museum

Irreparable: National Museum curator Orlando Abinion called the damage to the Marcoses possessions 'unfortunate' as they had an important place in Manila's history

Marikina officials borrowed 800 pairs of her shoes in 2001 for a shoe museum, which has become a tourist spot. Massive flooding, however, damaged dozens of pairs of Marcos' shoes in Marikina in 2009.

About 765 pairs, including famous brands like Gucci, Charles Jourdan, Christian Dior, Ferragamo, Chanel and Prada, survived the Marikina floods. The shoes still look remarkably new due to meticulous museum care, which includes displaying them in airtight and dust-free glass cabinets in an air-conditioned gallery, away from direct sunlight.

The shoe collection draws a daily crowd of 50 to 100 Philippine and foreign tourists, who almost always leave in awe, museum manager Jane Ballesteros said.

'The first word they utter is "Wow," followed by the question, "Was she able to wear all of these?"

'When I say, yes, look at the scratches on the soles, the next reaction is, "Really?" It's amusing. Her shoes never fail to astound people years after.'

Ferdinand Marcos
 died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 and his widow and children returned 
home years later.
