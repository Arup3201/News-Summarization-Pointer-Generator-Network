On A wind-battered British beach, a frail figure in a wheelchair gazes out over the pallid grey waves as a woman crouches attentively at his bare feet.

The man, almost impossible to recognise, is big-screen heart-throb and fashion icon Eddie Redmayne, who has undergone an incredible transformation for his new movie.

In the film, called Theory Of Everything, the Les Miserables star plays the brilliant physicist Stephen Hawking – and on Friday he and the rest of the crew were on the dunes of Camber Sands in East Sussex to film pivotal scenes.

The movie tells the poignant and inspirational story of the scientist’s love for his first wife Jane Wilde.

They met while they were both students in Cambridge in the 1960s, just as Hawking was beginning to suffer the early effects of the motor neurone disease which would eventually leave him almost entirely paralysed, dependent upon a speech synthesiser to communicate.

Redmayne – who has modelled for the Burberry fashion label and been named as one of Vanity Fair’s best-dressed people – had to put aside his normal sartorial elegance for a shabby suit and brown brogues to capture Hawking’s more ramshackle look.

In between shots, Redmayne dons a pair of wellington boots to ensure his costume isn’t damaged by the wintry waves. On other occasions he has to be carried along the beach by an obliging member of the film’s crew.

Both actors are rising fast through their profession. Redmayne, 31, won an Olivier award for his role in  the West End and Broadway play Red, and was last seen as Marius in Les Miserables.

Professor Hawking has reportedly welcomed his casting and has made a series of visits to the film’s sets in Cambridge where the bulk of shooting is taking place.

Meanwhile, Jones will star in the new Spider-Man film as well as playing Charles Dickens’s mistress Nelly Ternan opposite Ralph Fiennes in The Invisible Woman, both out next year.

Theory Of Everything, which is due for release in 2015, also co-stars Emily Watson, Maxine Peake and David Thewlis, and is inspired by Jane Hawking’s memoir, Travelling To Infinity: My Life With Stephen.

It was just after Hawking’s 21st birthday in 1963 when he was diagnosed. Doctors initially gave him two years to live, and he soon had difficulty walking very far on his own so started using a wheelchair.

The cosmologist has credited his love for Jane with helping him escape the depression which threatened to engulf his life. The couple married in 1965 and went on to have three children.

Hawking’s brilliance was recognised relatively early, and his theories on black holes and the creation of the universe established him as an intellectual force.

His 1987 book A Brief History Of Time sold ten million copies and catapulted him to widespread public recognition.

But Hawking’s success and his increasingly reliance on live-in carers took its toll on the marriage.

In 1977 Jane took up singing lessons and found herself increasingly close to widowed choirmaster Jonathan Hellyer Jones.

The couple’s relationship remained platonic for years, but by the 1980s they had become lovers.

Hawking, who was initially tolerant of the affair, subsequently left Jane and began a relationship with his carer Elaine Mason, whom he married in 1995 but divorced 11 years later. He continues to work at Cambridge University.
