This is the horrifying injury inflicted on a female civil servant by her ex boyfriend, who forced her to the floor, pushed his thumb in her eye socket and then bit the end of her nose off.

A witness to the attack told a court hearing that there was a 'gaping hole where the nose should have been'.

Surgeons repaired the nose by grafting skin from the victim's hip on to it.

Hull Crown Court heard how Simon Brittle, 45, from Rotherham, launched the savage attack on Heidi Smith, 40, at the Motorcycle Action Group three-day ‘Into The Valley Rally’ at South Dalton, near Beverley on May 4.

The assault was preceded by a chilling Facebook message sent by Brittle to Ms Smith that read: ‘I am looking forward to f***ing you up.’

Crown barrister Philip Evans said that on the day Brittle became loud and aggressive, threatening to stab one man, and accusing a friend of sleeping with Ms Smith.

He then punched and slapped her before twisting her arm, forcing her to the ground and straddling her.

‘He pushed his thumb in her eye socket,’ said Mr Evans. ‘That was painful. She screamed out for help, but other people thought it was a couple in an amorous embrace. But [witness] Sally Pearson heard a chilling scream. Others described it as blood curdling. Sally Pearson took hold of Mr Brittle’s shoulder and shouted at him.

‘The defendant was calm and Sally Pearson said he had a blank expression. She was told to get off. He lowered his head, as if they were going to kiss. Heidi Smith then let out an intense scream.’

Ms Pearson said: ‘I realised at once her nose was gone. Her nose was missing. There was a gaping bloody hole where her nose should have been.’

Miss Smith, a civil servant for the office of public guardian, was left holding her hands to her face in a pool of blood.

She was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary for reconstructive surgery where initial photographs shown to the judge were taken.

The operation involved taking skin from Ms Smith’s hip and grafting it onto her nose.

Ms Smith and Brittle had been in a turbulent four-month relationship that Smith was too frightened to finish, the court heard.

Two days before the rally he had sent her a Facebook message that read: ‘I am looking forward to f***ing you up over the weekend. Take plenty of body guards. Hers [sic] to a happy rally season. You don’t know what I am capable of.’

Giving evidence in court, Ms Smith told the judge: ‘I hate my nose. It is pointy and witchy and it’s a different colour. I am grateful the surgeon did a marvellous job, but I am conscious of it all the time.’

She said: ‘I fear his reprisals. He has never listened to anyone before.’

In a victim impact statement she revealed she feels she will have to move from her home of ten years.

She said: ‘I don’t feel like me anymore. I am really embarrassed by this I have had to relive the incident over and over again as work colleagues ask me what happened. I have tried to ignore it, but being my nose I cannot hide it or cover it up. I feel people judge me and think I have done something to deserve it. My family have been affected by this.

‘My mother had to deal with me screaming down the telephone. I cannot imagine having a boyfriend again. I have had interest from some guys, but had to decline them. I think it will be a long time before I can trust a man or be alone with them.’

Four months after the attack, Miss Smith still has problems with her arm movement where Brittle twisted it back. Because her nose is painful when it is cold she fears her hobbies of motorcycling and skiing will be affected.

She added: ‘Having heard Brittle was looking for a knife, I feel lucky to be alive. I feel I have to move from the home I have been in for 10 years. This incident has changed my life forever.’

Defence barrister John Thackray said: ‘There is absolutely no excuse for his behaviour. He is disgusted in himself. He was drunk.’

He said his life spiralled down. ‘He has gone from being a loyal partner, a good father and working man. There was a break-down in his relationship. He lost his work, became a carer for his father and suffered from depression,’ added Mr Thackray

Brittle, of Middle Lane, Rotherham, pleaded guilty to a charge of GBH with intent.

Sentencing Judge Mark Bury told Brittle: ‘You have pleaded guilty to this serious and bestial offence of grievous bodily harm with intent. On the day you had been drinking. You were loud and aggressive. Before this you threatened to stab someone and smashed two cans of lager together. You put your thumbs into Ms Smith’s eye socket. She was screaming out for assistance, but you did not stop there.

‘You then bit her nose off, completely off at the tip - a totally wicked and horrifying offence. She now says her nose is hideous pointy and witchy. She says not a day goes by when she does not think about it. She says her life has been changed and will never get back to the way it was.

'She was your partner, and a vulnerable victim. You must have realised she was scared. The use of your teeth was plainly the use of a weapon. This was not just in public. This was in full view of Heidi Smith’s friends.’

He jailed Brittle for eight years and imposed an indefinite restraining order on contacting Ms Smith.

Smith, who left court on the verge of tears, declined to comment on Brittle’s sentence, but praised the Motorcycle Action Group activists and surgeons who could not do enough to help her.
