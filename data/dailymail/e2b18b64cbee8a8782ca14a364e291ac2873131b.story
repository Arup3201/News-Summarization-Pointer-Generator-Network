A British academic has said conspiracy theories are built into American culture because the country was founded on them. 

Professor Sir Richard Evans, of the University of Cambridge, is leading a project into conspiracy theories and is Britain's leading authority on the subject matter.

Speaking at the Hay Festival yesterday, he said conspiracy theories are more common in the United States compared with other countries.

'There is an argument that conspiracy theories are built into American culture because that is how America started. 

'The United States was founded on conspiracy theories: the London government was conspiring to deprive America of their liberties.'

Mr Evans cited the JFK assassination, the 9/11 attacks and even campaigns which claim President Obama is not American. 

He also believes the internet has not led to an increased belief in such theories.

Following the assassination of JFK in 1963, most Americans believed Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone. 

However, the number of people who believe this conspiracy theory now has decreased since the growth of the internet. 

Mr Evans believes conspiracy theories normally form following a traumatic event. 

For example the McCarthy witch hunts took place following the Second World War. However, in recent years, many theories have been directed at governments.

Mr Evans said at the festival: 'In the late 19th century conspiracy theories were directed against big business and cartels.

'This did not happen so much in the recent economic crisis where conspiracy theories have been targeted much more at government.

'Is it because governments play a much bigger role in our lives than they did a century ago?'

Research for the project will be published in 2017.

Mr Evans is a Fellow of the British Academy, the Royal Society of Literature and the Royal Historical Society.

He is also an Honorary Fellow of Jesus College, Oxford, Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and Birkbeck College, London.

He is also the editor of the Journal of Contemporary History.

September 11, 2011 - Despite repeated claims by al-Qaeda that it planned the attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York, several official and unofficial investigations into the collapse of the Twin Towers suggest that structural failure was responsible.

Some theorists believe the U.S. government had prior warning of the attacks but did not do enough to stop them.

Others believe the Bush administration deliberately turned a blind eye to warnings to launch wards in the Middle East. 

A large group of people who call themselves the 9/11 Truth Movement believe an aircraft did not hit the Pentagon and that the World Trade Centre could not have been brought down by an airliner impact and burning aviation fuel. 

They say there is also video evidence to suggest there were puffs of smoke coming from the Twin Towers at levels far below the impact zones. 

Many witnesses claim to have heard explosions before the aircraft impacts.

The assassination of John F Kennedy -

The 35th President of the United States was shot on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas at 12.30pm.

He was fatally wounded by gunshots while riding with his wife - Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy - in a motorcade.

The ten-month investigation of the Warren Commission of 1963 to 1964, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) of 1976 to 1979, and other government investigations concluded that the President had been assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald - who was himself shot dead by Jack Ruby while in police custody.

However, there has always been doubts that Oswald was the lone gunman who fired shots from the Texas Book Depository which overlooked Dealey Plaza.

Footage taken by Abraham Zapruder on 8mm film supported the belief that at least four shots were fired and not three which the Warren Commission claimed.

It has also been suggested that at least one of the shots came from a completely different direction. Many believe shots were fired by a gunman hiding behind a picket fence on a grassy knoll overlooking the plaza.

In 1979 the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) found both the original FBI investigation and the Warren Commission Report to be seriously flawed.

The HSCA also concluded that there were at least four shots fired and that it was probable that a conspiracy existed.

However, later studies, including one by the National Academy of Sciences, have called into question the accuracy of the evidence used by the HSCA to support its finding of four shots.

A flying saucer crashed at Roswell in 1947 - What is certain is that something did crash at Roswell, New Mexico, sometime before July 7, 1947 and - at first - the U.S. authorities stated explicitly that this was a flying saucer or disk.

Numerous witnesses reported seeing metallic debris scattered over a wide area and at least one reported seeing a blazing craft crossing the sky shortly before it crashed.

In 1989, former mortician Glenn Dennis claimed that he was involved in alien autopsies which were carried out at the Roswell air force base.

Some theorists believe autopsies were allegedly carried out on aliens who crashed in the New Mexico desert which was then covered up by American authorities

Weight has been added to the conspiracy theory due to the U.S. military repeatedly changing its story.

Since the late 1990s, several former pro-UFO researchers have concluded that the craft was, indeed, part of a U.S. military project and that it was, most likely, some sort of weather balloon.

However, Walter Haut, the Roswell Army Air Field public affairs officer, said he saw alien corpses and a craft which was involved in a military cover up. He died in 2005.Nasa faked the moon landings -

Some theorists believe Apollo astronauts did not land on the Moon.

They claim Nasa and possibly others deceived the public into believing the landings.

They have pointed to photographs from the lunar surface which they claim show camera crosshairs partially behind rocks, a flag planted by Buzz Aldrin moving in a strange way, the lack of stars over the lunar landscape and shadows falling in different directions.

The Jesus conspiracy - The theory that launched the novel The Da Vinci Code and a film of the same name.

Theorists believe Jesus married Mary Magdalene, had one or more children, and that those children or their descendants emigrated to southern France.

Once there, they intermarried with the noble families that would eventually become the Merovingian dynasty, whose special claim to the throne of France is championed today by a secret society called the Priory of Sion.

Elvis Presley faked his own death - There has been a belief that Elvis did not actually die in 1977. Many even think he is still alive and that he went into hiding.

Two tabloid newspapers ran articles covering the continuing 'life' of Presley after his death including a broken leg from a motorcycle accident, all the way up to his 'real death' in the mid 1990s.

Operation Northwoods - A conspiracy involving a plan by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to launch a fake Cuban terror campaign on American soil to persuade the U.S. public to support an invasion against Castro. 

The plan involved bombings and the simultaneous hijacking and blowing up of American airliners. The operation was quashed by President Kennedy leading many to speculate that it was linked to his assassination a year later.

The plan has also been linked by theorists who believe that the September 11, 2001 attacks were a so-called 'inside job' because of the use of airliners.

North American Union - The North American Union (NAU) is a theoretical regional union of Canada, Mexico and the United States similar in structure to the European Union, sometimes including a common currency called the amero.

Theorists who believe that the three countries are planning for this believe that it is part of a global conspiracy to set up something called the New World Order (NWO). Officials from all three nations have repeatedly denied that there are plans to create a NAU.

Pearl Harbor was allowed to happen - Theorists believe that President Franklin Roosevelt provoked the Japanese attack on the U.S. naval base in Hawaii in December 1941, knew about it in advance and covered up his failure to warn his fleet commanders.

He apparently needed the attack to provoke Hitler into declaring war on the U.S. because the American public and Congress were overwhelmingly against entering the war in Europe.

Theorists believe that the U.S. was warned by the governments of Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, Peru, Korea and the Soviet Union that a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was coming and that the Americans had intercepted and broken all the important Japanese codes in the run up to the attack.
