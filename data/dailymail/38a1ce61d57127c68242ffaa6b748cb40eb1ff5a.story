He danced his way into our hearts when he and his owner Ashleigh Butler won Britain's Got Talent with their elaborately choreographed routines.

So it's only fair that Pudsey the dancing dog now be treated and pampered like the star he is - especially if he wants to look his best for tonight's performance on America's Got Talent.

Hollywood stars: Pudsey and Ashleigh have been taken to Hollywood by Simon Cowell, where the dancing dog was treated to a spa day in the Chateau Marmutt dog centre

Step in Simon Cowell, Pudsey's number 
one fan, who has whisked the talented six-year-old mutt and his 17-year-old trainer off
to LA, and treated the high-kicking hound to a spa day in one of the 
city's most exclusive doggy parlours, Chateau Marmutt.

A
wordplay on Chateau Marmont - one of Hollywood's most illustrious 
luxury human hotels - Chateau Marmutt is a high-end doggy day care centre which caters to man's best friend's every need.

To leave your dog in the capable hands of the centre's certified staff costs $8 (£5.12) per hour, $35 ($22.38) for full day.

Extra treatments available to the discerning dog include full-body massages, by appointment only; teeth and ear-cleaning sessions for up to $15; $20 pawicures (dog manicures); weight-loss programmes; private and group training sessions with the 'best certified trainers in Los Angeles'; and of course, the salon's signature aromatherapy grooming sessions, which can cost up to $150, depending on the type of dog.

During his aromatherapy session - which includes bath, cut and nail trim - Pudsey would have been able to chose between a selection of the finest all-natural dog shampoos.

Some boutique variations available at the Chateau including honeysuckle, citrus (a natural flea repellent), oatmeal (for dry skin), or medicated (for hot spots and allergies).

like to spend with your pooch.

'At Chateau Marmutt, your best friend will
get all the attention and exercise needed in a dog-friendly and safe 
setting.

'Every day at Chateau Marmutt is spent socializing with canine 
pals under the watchful eyes of friendly and caring professionals.

'Frolicking at Chateau Marmutt is the ultimate way for pups to spend 
their days.

'Make no bones about it, Chateau Marmutt Dog Day Care 
is for you too.

nothing like relaxing with your happy and well-exercised pal.'

Pudsey - who is a cross between a Bichon Frise, a Border Collie a Chinese Crested Powder Puff - shot to fame in April when he and his owner Ashleigh 
performed an intricate, highly choreographed dance routine on the sixth series of ITV's 
Britain's Got Talent.

Their audition piece, set to the Flintstone's theme song, won a standing ovation from both the audience and the judging panel - even hard-to-impress (but dog-mad) judge Simon Cowell who has always been desperate to find a dancing canine.

Ashleigh and Pudsey, who live in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, won the final on May 12 and received £500,000.

As part of their prize, the pair will perform at the 84th Royal Variety Performance in December 2012 in front of Queen Elizabeth.
