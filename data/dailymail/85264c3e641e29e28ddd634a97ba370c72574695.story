Large cities in the United States are safer than their rural counterparts, a new study has claimed.

Researchers have found that the risk of injury and death is 20 per cent greater in the countryside than in inner city urban areas across the States.

The most common causes of 'injury death' were vehicle crashes, according to the American study, due to be published tomorrow.

Large cities in the United States are safer than their rural counterparts, a new study has claimed. New York's Times Square, once a hotbed of crime, is now a global tourist attraction thronged with families

A study, which is due to be published tomorrow, analysed the deaths of 1.3million people from injury between 1999 and 2006.

It analysed the deaths of 1.3million people from injury between 1999 and 2006.

Study author Sage Myers of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, said: 'Cars, guns and drugs are the unholy trinity causing the majority of injury deaths in the U.S.

'Although the risk of homicide is higher in big cities, the risk of unintentional injury death is 40 percent higher in the most rural areas than in the most urban.

'And overall, the rate of unintentional injury dwarfs the risk of homicide, with the rate of unintentional injury more than 15 times that of homicide among the entire population.

'This has important implications about staffing of emergency departments and trauma care systems in rural areas, which tend to be undeserved as it is.'

The most common causes of injury death were road accidents with researchers noting 27.61 deaths per 100,000 people in most rural areas and 10.58 per 100,000 in most urban areas.

Though the risk of gun-related deaths showed no difference in the rural and urban areas, experts did find that they were significantly higher in rural areas for children and people 45 years and older.

The teams found that race was also a factor with rural counties with large black populations having significantly lower risk of injury death than those with small black populations.

But the opposite was true for Latino populations, with countryside counties with large Latino populations noting significantly higher risk of injury death than those with smaller populations.

It also found thatÂ  rural middle class areas with lots of college-educated residents and average income had significantly increased risk of injury death compared to rural counties with the lowest levels of each.

'By digging deep into the data, we may be able to tailor injury prevention efforts to the populations that need them, such as seniors in cities who are more likely to fall and rural children who are more likely to drown,' said Dr Myers.
