Andy Murray needed a tide of energy to supress Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in brutal conditions and he will now need to summon up another one if he is to stay alive in the US Open.

A grand slam rematch with Novak Djokovic in the quarter finals was the reward for the colossal physical effort he put in to defeat the Frenchman 7-5, 7-5, 6-4 in two hours and 35 minutes and claim his first win against a top ten player this season.

Murray needed to rage at himself – and occasionally his team – as he skilfully fought back to claim the second set in one of his most animated performances since returning from back surgery in January.

Roar: Andy Murray beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to set up a quarter-final against Novak Djokovic at the US Open

Delight: Murray celebrates his win over Tsonga in straight sets on Arthur Ashe Stadium

Even his normally restrained girlfriend Kim Sears was up on her feet as his team tried to sustain him in the kind of heat that is normally accompanied by storms in these parts.

'It was extremely tough, windy and humid,' he said. 'The first two sets were very tough and mentally quite draining, and the third set could have got away. Luckily Jo missed a few serves at the end.

'I've had some long matches against Novak and I hope I can play to my top level. If I do that I will have a chance.'

He will welcome a day's rest before what is sure to be a night match on Wednesday. It will be their first meeting since history was made at Wimbledon last year, with memories also of beating him at Flushing Meadows in 2012, and the Serb will not be as generous with the unforced errors as Tsonga was. 

Cruise: The British No 1 won the first set 7-5  on Arthur Ashe Stadium to take command of the match

Frustration: Tsonga held a break of serve in both the second and third sets but lost them both

The world No 10 is the kind who hits both hot streaks and despondent lulls, and we saw both on Monday. He defeated Murray in their last meeting at the recent Canadian Open when the Scot wasted a 3-1 lead in the deciding set, but this time there was no mistake.

By the time they walked on court during the steaming heat of Labour Day afternoon, Djokovic was steadily completing his business, defeating Phillip Kohlschreiber 6-1, 7-5, 6-4.

Against a tricky opponent it was not quite the cakewalk the world No 1 had previously enjoyed and he needed to save a break point in the second set. Ultimately he was able to make it into the last eight without dropping a set and he will be totally fresh for the next match. 

Done and dusted: Murray wrapped up a 7-5, 7-5, 6-4 victory in the last-16 contest

Just as against Andrey Kuznetsov in the third round Murray played a high quality first set and bar an angry blip early in the second, when he began ranting like a late night reveller on Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street, the standard was impressive for the most part.

Early on his serve looked nigh on impregnable and break points were forced in the Frenchman's two opening service games. The first was saved by a 130mph winner but the next two saw the Scot getting into the rally before fluffing a forehand and then a backhand into the net.

This is the kind of thing that happens when you are short of confidence building wins against the best players.

The reason Murray likes this particular match-up most of the time is that he can absorb the power coming from the other end and react to it, which is his natural modus operandi.

But Tsonga cut down his unforced errors, at least until they got to 6-5 when he was gifted two break points. On the second he made no mistake, driving the return deep into the corner and then running in after it to put away the volley.

In the third game, Tsonga got hold of Murray's inviting second serve and nicked a break from 15-40 down when an attempted drop shot faded into the net. Murray berated himself in the manner that he pretty much cut out under Ivan Lendl. 'You're so slow!' she shouted at himself, followed by 'You've got two legs, use them!'

All of this gives succour to an opponent and soon the Scot was also unloading at his box to a bemused looking Amelie Mauresmo about his inability to pin down Tsonga, who was forcing him further back in the court.

Chuntering to himself and abusing his coaching staff rarely works but it fired him up when he blasted two exquisite winners to level at 4-4 with Tsonga's level now suddenly dropping, as it is wont to do.

Running in to crunch away some dreadful drop shots Murray suddenly forced a set point at 6-5 and made no mistake with a deep backhand that drew a forehand error to go two sets up.

In this punishing arena, complete with humidity, Murray's weeks of training in Miami each year are particularly handy but if Tsonga was downcast by losing five of the previous six games he hid it well by going an early break up.

That was wiped out immediately and the pressure saw the Frenchman's serve collapse at 4-5 with two double faults that let Murray close it out.
