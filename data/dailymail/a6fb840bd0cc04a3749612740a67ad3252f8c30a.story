Courts in some parts of the country jail barely one in two burglars while others send down as many as 90 per cent, a new 'leniency league table' reveals today.

The table, which is based on official Ministry of Justice figures, shows an astonishing variation in how Crown Courts deal with convicted burglars.

It comes just days after Judge Peter Bowers, sitting at Teesside Crown Court, sparked outrage by praising a housebreaker for his 'courage'.

Lenient: Courts in some parts of the country jail barely one in two burglars

But the table reveals that 30 courts across England and Wales were more lenient towards burglars than Teesside in 2010.

Leniency league: Tables are based on official Ministry of Justice figures

Based on the number of burglars given immediate jail sentences, Newport in South Wales was the most lenient court in the country with just under 58 per cent of the crimes ending in jail straight away.

Portsmouth was little better at just over 58 per cent, with the figure for Basildon in Essex 59 per cent.

But in stark contrast, judges in leafy Dorchester in Dorset were the toughest in 2010, handing down immediate jail sentences in more than 90 per cent of burglary cases.

Chichester in West Sussex was the second strictest Crown Court on housebreakers with an 88 per cent prison sentence rate.

Four other courts - in Northampton, Warwick, Derby and Ipswich - handed out immediate jail sentences in more than 85 per cent of cases.

Last night, Tory MP Philip Davies, who unearthed the figures through Parliamentary questions, called on new Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to investigate.

Mr Davies said: 'What this table reveals is a map showing burglars the best places to get caught if they want to avoid being sent down.

'I am astonished that one court jails nine out of ten while others are sending not much more than one in two burglars to their just deserts.'

Yorkshire MP Mr Davies last week branded Judge Bowers 'an idiot' after he gave burglar Richard Rochford, 26, a suspended sentence after commenting about the amount of courage he believed it took to enter someone's house.

Mr Davies said that he was particularly worried that 30 courts were more lenient than Teesside in 2010.

Tougher laws: Patrick Mercer is Tory MP for Newark and an ex Army colonel

In 1999, the Norfolk farmer Tony Martin killed one of my constituents and injured another when they went to burgle his farm. Quite rightly, Mr Martin was prosecuted and served time in prison but the case became a cause celebre.

Last Sunday, Andy Ferrie and his wife Tracey from Leicestershire used a legally-held shotgun to defend themselves against a number of men who are alleged to have broken into their property.

Two of them were wounded and the Ferries were held and questioned by police for more than two days before being released at the behest of the Crown Prosecution Service.

Now, the two cases are very different, but there is one important similarity – the law does not protect householders from intrusion in the way I believe that it should.

In 2004, I initiated a Private Members' Bill that would have solved the problem.

After the Martin case, there had been a very important change in civil law.

Brendan Fearon, my constituent who had been wounded in the burglary, attempted to sue Mr Martin for the injuries that he caused.

As civil law then stood, he would have to prove that Mr Martin had used 'unreasonable force'. Very quickly, though, the government  of the day amended civil law and raised the threshold using the phrase 'grossly disproportionate' force.

My Bill was designed to bring criminal law into step with civil law. Dominic Grieve, the then Shadow Attorney General, drafted a simple amendment which would have  the effect of giving ordinary householders the protection of the 'grossly disproportionate' proviso.

It seemed at one stage that the Bill had the support of Tony Blair and the then Met Police Commissioner. Brendan Fearon even told my local newspaper that such a change in the law would deter him from breaking and entering in future. The whole issue was immensely popular.

My Bill was scuppered by a disgraceful piece of chicanery  from the Labour Party.

I was delighted, then, when the Conservative manifesto in 2010 said: 'We will give householders greater legal protection if they have to defend themselves against intruders in their own homes.'

Such promises were not contained in the Coalition Agreement although the Coalition has tweaked the law a little further. But it's cases such as that of the Ferries that must cause decisive action to be taken now.

This need can only be underlined by the extraordinary statement from Judge Peter Bowers last week who apparently told an offender that 'it takes a huge amount of courage ... for somebody to burgle somebody's house'.

It is an astounding statement and the Prime Minister, absolutely properly, condemned it completely.

But he also went on to say 'that's why this Government is changing the law to toughen the rules on self defence towards burglars'.

Really? It's two years later and yet we still do not have the 'grossly disproportionate' phrase enshrined in criminal law.

Released: Andy and Tracey Ferrie were held for more than two days by police

I don't want householders to be given a licence to butcher intruders in their homes, but I do want normal people to feel that the law is unquestionably on their side and  not on that of the criminals.

I also want the police and the CPS to be confident about not putting people like the Ferries through days of anguish when such anguish should be reserved for offenders.

When they were in Opposition, the Tories seemed very clear about what needed to be done. Indeed, many of my Bill's greatest supporters are now in power. Yet, something is stopping them from putting their earlier words into action.

Dithering doesn't deter. The Government needs to listen, not  just to decent people, but to burglars like Brendan Fearon  and change the law now.
