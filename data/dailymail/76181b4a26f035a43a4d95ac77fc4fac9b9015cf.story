They say dog is a man’s best friend, and for one very special pet, that means a £47,000 canine holiday complete with limousine transfers and personal chef.

One lucky dog will be treated to the world’s most expensive package holiday for dogs with a two-week stay at The Paw Seasons in Long Ashton near Bristol.

British Olympic hurdler Dai Greene is on hand to take the pampered pet for runs, before it is treated to a spa sessions and pedicures.

The dog will be waited on hand-and-paw every day of the luxurious stay and every meal will be tailor-made by a personal chef.

Surfing,
board games and swimming are also on the agenda and dog-orientated 
movies such as 101 Dalmatians and Lassie will be screened at a private 
cinema in the evenings with popcorn by the bucket load.

Designer Louis Vuitton collars, Bottega 
Veneta leads and a Mulberry mackintosh will add style to the 
holidaymaker's wardrobe and animal behavioural specialist Stan Rawlinson will help 
the pet open up about its life during one-on-one psychiatry sessions.
