Nelson Mandela's grand-daughters have been accused of cashing in on his fame by appearing in a reality TV show.

But the two sisters, both their 30s, insist that their family trust them to do what they want, provided they act with 'respect and integrity'.

Being Mandela, a 13-part series following the lives of fashionable Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway and Swati Dlamini in Johannesburg, premiers on Sunday.

Famous name: Swati Dlamini, left, and Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway, will star in reality show 'Being Mandela'

In it, the sisters bicker, gossip and cope with the usual family disputes - but their ancestry sets them apart from the typical reality TV star.

While the 94-year-old former South African president does not appear in the show, his ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela - 'Big Mommy' to her grandchildren - has a central role.

Swati Dlamini said: 'We get asked this 
question a lot. Is this not going to tarnish the name and is this not 
going to be bad for the name?'

'But our grandparents have always said to
us, this is our name too, and we can do what we think is best fitting 
with the name, as long as we treat it with respect and integrity.'

Mandela, who the girls know as their strict 'Big Grandpa', was recently treated for a lung infection and had surgery to remove gallstones.

The sisters say their grandfather, who they only really got to know after he retired from public life, is now 'happy and healthy.'

The show, made by COZI TV for NBC, contains various revelations about Mandela, who his grand-daughters say sees himself as 'belonging to his country'.

'Our grandfather always told us that he 
belongs to the country and he's of service to the country and he doesn't
belong to us as a family,' said Swati.

'And that's the sacrifice he's made for the 
country and that what he's told us as far as I can remember.'

They insist the Nobel Peace Prize winner is a fan of reality television and will watch the show.

'You'll be interested to know that he 
loves Toddlers and Tiaras,' added Swati, in reference to the
series about child beauty pageants.

At home: The sisters share a recent photo of Nelson Mandela, 95, with his great grandson Zen Manaway, one

'Because of the kids,' added Zaziwe, 35, who has three children with her husband, an American businessman. 'He just loves children.'

She shows the cameras a photograph of 
Mandela at home last week, flashing his familiar smile, with his youngest 
great-grandchild on his lap - her one-year-old son.

The picture is a
rare public image of Mandela, whose last appearance on a major stage 
was during the 2010 World Cup soccer tournament in South Africa.

The sisters, who spent most of their childhood in exile in the United States, make an emotional visit to the prison on Robben Island where their grandfather spent 18 of the 27 years he was imprisoned by South Africa's white-ruled government.

Controversial: While Mandela does not appear in the show, ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela features heavily

Swati, who has a four-year-old daughter, works on publishing the prison diaries that her grandmother wrote but now cannot bear to read.

Swati, whose full name is Zamaswazi, was smuggled on to Robben Island in 1980, when she was less than a year old, wrapped in blankets her grandmother pretended she needed as protection against the cold.

Let in on the secret, prison guard Christo Brand recalls initially refusing to allow Mandela to see his grandchild, according to his memoir at the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory.

Brand says he eventually gave in, though he feared he might lose his job.

'I gave him the baby, he had tears in his eyes while he held her,' he said. 'Mandela never told anyone about this. When we walked back to the prison section, he told me how important the moment was, to touch something small.'

The sisters, along with two brothers, are the latest famous names to launch a fashion line, called 'Long Walk to Freedom' in honour of their grandfather's autobiography.

Their hope is that U.S. audiences will see a vibrant and modern side of South Africa through their eyes.

Mandela, who always lamented his long separation from his family during his imprisonment, is happiest these days when his offspring are running around being loud, his granddaughters say.

'We're in and out of the house. We're loud and he loves the noise,' Zaziwe said.

The sisters are the daughters of Zenani Mandela and Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini of Swaziland.

They say their grandfather - a symbol of integrity and magnanimity across the world - holds the family to high standards and sets rules for when the children should be home and when dinner should start.

'He's a very strict person,' said Zaziwe. Most people wouldn't think that but he really, really is,'

The sisters are closer to grandmother, who divorced Mandela in 1997. Their adoring description of their grandmother as the doting matriarch contrasts sharply with her chequered public image.

Mrs Madikizela-Mandela faces accusations, which she denies, that she and her bodyguard unit committed 18 killings in the 1980s.

'She's fun,' added Zaziwe. 'She never says no to us. I don't think I've ever heard my grandmother say no to us.'

The series shows 'Big Mommy' clearly taking charge of the family - marching into the hospital room where Zaziwe gave birth to Zen with a list of possible names for the boy.
