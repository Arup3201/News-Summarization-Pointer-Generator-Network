Murderer Mark Bridger boasted to friends 'I know where to hide a body' in the months before he killed five-year-old April Jones.

Bridger - jailed for the rest of his life for the killing - was described by his former friends as a loner who was fascinated by serial killers.

The ex-slaughterman, 47, has refused to reveal what he did with the schoolgirl's remains after she died, claiming he cannot remember.

'I know where to hide a body': Mark Bridger (right), convicted of killing April Jones (left), boasted that he knew the best place to conceal a body after a killing

April's parents Coral and Paul Jones yesterday begged Bridger to reveal what he did with her body.

Bridger's friend revealed the oddball killer would often camp alone near his home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, with only a crate of super strength lager Special Brew or cider for company.

They told The Sun that Bridger regularly liked to discuss where he would conceal a body.

'He did know the woods and hills around here very well because he'd spend all his time in the wild,' they said.

'He'd say stuff like "this area here or there would be real good for getting rid of a body".'

The friend added that he wasn't surprised when Bridger was arrested.

The murderer was described by Mr Justice Griffith Williams at Mold Crown Court yesterday as a 'pathological and glib liar' as he was given a rare whole life sentence.

The friend added: 'He was a very strange guy. Sometimes he could be mild-mannered and well-spoken. Then he'd talk about serial killers and concealing corpses.'

Bridger also used to boast about being in the Special Forces and would wear camouflage gear.

But residents in the market town did not believe his bizarre claims about his army past and knew he bought his kit from the local market.

The oddball killer also liked to discuss some of the world's most infamous serial killers - including Jeffrey Dahmer, a cannibal who murdered at least 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991.

He also talked about Dennis Rader who murdered 10 people in the US between 1974 and 1991. He was known for leaving the signature BTK - which stood for 'Blind, Torture, Kill' whenever he struck.

When police searched Bridger's cottage they found that he had been watching a brutal rape scene from the 2009 re-make of the slasher film, The Last House on the Left.

The lies begin: Bridger, 46, was arrested on October 2 as he walked along a road on the outskirts of Machynlleth, wearing a camouflage jacket and waterproof trousers, the day after April's disappearance

Distancing himself from a horrific crime: Prosecutors said Bridger 'relentlessly spun a web of lies and half-truths' ever since he was first interviewed by police 

He had recorded the scene where a young teenage girl is raped by the leader of a gang in front of his watching gangmates, some of whom help to hold the victim down while she is being attacked.

Police then discovered that the murderer recorded the rape scene for a second time when the film was repeated on a +1 channel an hour later.

A former friend claimed that the killer was a big fan of the Saw films and 'watched them all the time'.

They also claimed that Bridger 
regularly stole power tools from homes being refurbished or building 
sites before selling them on.

Bridger was arrested on October 2 last year - the day after April vanished while playing on her bike
 near her home and her
 body has never been found.

Yesterday he was convicted of abducting and murdering April and 
of unlawfully disposing of and concealing her body with intent to 
pervert the course of justice.

During the trial, Bridger repeatedly wept as he painted a pathetic picture of himself as a man who had 
'accidentally' run over April and then panicked before blacking out 
due to alcohol.

He also tried to explain away a 
sickening cache of child porn on his computer by saying they were used 
to study the development of his children.

Others, he said, had been stored there because he intended to complain to websites which were displaying the images.

After the trial, Ed Beltrami, Chief Crown Prosecutor 
for CPS Wales, said: 'Ever
 since his first interview with police in October last year, Mark 
Bridger has relentlessly spun a web of lies and half-truths to try and 
distance himself from the truly horrific nature of the crime he 
perpetrated.

'He has refused to take responsibility for what he did to April and has stopped at nothing to try and cover his tracks.'

Yesterday a picture was released of Bridger wearing handcuffs and flanked by two police officers as he was taken into a police station for the first time after his arrest.
