A manhole cover designed by Antony Gormley, one of Britain’s most celebrated sculptors, has been stolen after being praised in a blog.

Gormley, 63, who is best known for his Angel of the North statue, created the distinctive cover for a street in Peckham, South London, where it remained for a decade.

But the iron plate, designed around the artist’s feet, was stolen after a blogger gave details of where it was. Ian Mansfield, 44, included a picture of the cover and went on to describe how he felt standing on it.

After: The replacement that was placed in the hole after the theft

Writing on his IanVisits blog, Mr Mansfield, who lives in London’s Docklands, said: ‘On a small side street in deepest Peckham, without notice or warning, can be found a piece of Antony Gormley art work.

Hundreds of cars drive over it every day.’ He added: ‘You can find the spot for deep contemplation on the junction between Maxted Road and Sandison Street.’

It is not clear whether the thief read the blog but several people have posted complaints questioning the wisdom of drawing attention to its location. One wrote: ‘Nice work telling everyone exactly where it was with such a detailed map. I hope you are pleased with yourself.’

Another described Mr Mansfield as a ‘dumbo’ and urged him to use some common sense in future.

A spokesman for Thames Water, which commissioned Gormley  to create the piece, said: ‘We’re appalled Antony’s manhole cover has been stolen. We’ve since gone out and put a new bog-standard cover down, but his was one-in-a-million – in fact, more than one-in-a-million, as we have 1.2 million manhole covers across our region.’

He added: ‘We’re determined to track down whoever did this and get back what is ours.’

Mr Gormley declined to comment last night.
