Eurozone finance chiefs have struck a deal with the International Monetary Fund that will see Greek debt reduced and the next installment of a bailout loan paid to the debt ridden country.

Ministers took 12 hours to thrash out the agreement in Brussels last night, which will see Greece paid £36billion in bailout money next month.

Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras welcomed the news as a 'great victory' for his country.

Deal: Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said that news of the agreement was a 'great victory' for his country, while leader of the Eurozone finance ministers group Jean-Claude Juncker lauded the Greeks for hauling their country back from the brink

He said: 'As Greeks, we fought together. And tomorrow a new day begins for all Greeks.'

It was the third time in two weeks that finance ministers from the 17 countries that use the Euro had met to hammer out an agreement.

The EU lauded all Greeks for hauling their country back from the brink.

Leader of the eurozone finance ministers' group, Jean-Claude Juncker said: 'We strongly believe in the Greek capacity to recover. The Greek people are courageous people.

'They are willing to bring their country back on the path of growth.'

The so-called troika of the European Central Bank, IMF and the European Commission, which is the 27-country EU's executive arm, have twice agreed to bail out Greece, pledging a total of 240 billion euro, the equivalent of £194billion, in rescue loans - of which the country has received about 150billion (£121billion) so far.

In return for its bailout loans, Greece has had to impose several rounds of austerity measures and submit its economy to scrutiny.

Greece is predicted to enter its sixth year of recession shortly and has a quarter of its workforce out of a job, and there had been fears it might be forced to drop out of the eurozone, destabilising other countries in the process.

The next installment of bailout payments will be given to the country on December 13.
