There are people on the internet who enjoy listening to a cat purring on YouTube.

They were, up until now, a niche group, content to listen to their unique choice of soundtrack undisturbed.

But now YouTube has targeted cat lovers everywhere by claiming one cat's purr is infringing the copyright of music giants, EMI and PRS for Music.

YouTube has targeted cat lovers everywhere by claiming one cat's purr is infringing the copyright of music giants, EMI and PRS for Music. The offending piece was an hour-long, audio-only YouTube upload of a cat named Phantom, uploaded in March by Digihaven

The offending piece was an hour-long, audio-only YouTube upload of a cat named Phantom, posted in March by Digihaven.

The video was flagged by YouTube's Content ID system as possibly using a song called Focus.

TorrentFreak reported that by 'claiming' the video, those rights holders disabled Digihaven's ability to make money from it through advertising.

Content ID works by automatically scanning videos for audio and video content deemed 'infringing' by those who own it.

Digihaven has since filed a dispute and was partially successful, with EMI lifting its claim.'Phantom is currently independent, but looking to sign on with an indie label,' he said. 'Phantom's lawyer filed a complaint, looking for 10 lbs of catnip in damages'

As well as issuing a warning to YouTubers, Content ID immediately starts diverting advertising revenue from the video creator to whoever filed the claim.

Last year, the system came under attack after thousands of notices were sent to YouTube gamers, claiming their videos were in violation of copyright, and are owned by someone else.

Phantom was accused of a 12-second video loop infringement violation, in the video which had been viewed less than 3,000 times.

Digihaven has since filed a dispute and was partially successful, with EMI lifting its claim.

'Phantom is currently independent, but looking to sign on with an indie label,' he said. 'Phantom's lawyer filed a complaint, looking for 10 lbs of catnip in damages.'

YouTube has yet to respond to DailyMail.com about the issue.

The Irish word for film, scannán, was being used as a secret phrase to hide pornography on the site and circumvent a ban on explicit material

The Irish word for film, scannán, seems innocuous enough to Gaeilgeoirs.

But a group of YouTube users has been using it as a secret phrase to hide pornography on the site and circumvent a ban on explicit material.

The issue was highlighted after an Irish media student searched for 'scannán' and the plural 'scannáin' only to find pornographic footage featuring Asian women.

The films, disguised using various Irish language titles, were uploaded by four different accounts which were all registered in October. 

Connemara-based Maitíú Ó Coimín, a journalist with the Irish language website Tuairisc, first reported the issue after his flatmate found the material.

'My flatmate is a media student in Galway who was looking up [the Irish word for film] on YouTube for a project,' Mr Coimín told the BBC.

'I looked a bit further into it, and there were about 15 to 20 films of a questionable nature.'

Mr Coimín added that the accounts were probably not owned by Irish speakers – or Gaeilgeoirs - as the phrasing in the description suggests an online translation tool was used.
