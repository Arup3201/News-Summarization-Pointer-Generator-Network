 

Cristiano Ronaldo scored a record 35th goal in the Champions League knockout stages with a nod of the head against Schalke on Wednesday night.

Ronaldo's 58th goal in as many games for Real Madrid was his first ever scored with his head away from the Bernabeu in Europe's elite competition.  

Ronaldo continues to make fools of the best defenders in the world and not just in his own backyard, having scored in seven different countries - Spain, Italy, England, Portugal, Russia, Turkey and Germany - and 11 different cities since 2007.

Penalty: 7

Home goals: 26

Away goals: 32 

His first goal of the 35 came for Manchester United against Roma at Old Trafford on April 10, 2007, before his header  a year later against Chelsea on neutral ground in Moscow helped Sir Alex Ferguson win the Champions League final.

He's since swapped England for Spain, and Real's 2-0 victory over Schalke became his 28th win in the knockout stages - yet another record, overtaking Edwin van der Sar and Victor Valdes on 27.

The Portugal international was under pressure to perform in Germany. His run of three games without scoring was unheard of, given he had not went through such a drought since February 2011.

Yet the fact that such a fuss was kicked up over Ronaldo not scoring against Cordoba, Atletico Madrid or Deportivo in La Liga is testament to his talent, and the expectations that follow.

Thankfully the Bernabeu boo boys were not given ammunition to scrutinise him for long. Not when Ronaldo's track record on German territory has seen him score in three different cities against Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Schalke.

The three-time Ballon d'Or winner netted against Schalke at the Veltins-Arena in February 2014, and doing so again a year later on Wednesday night meant he scored in his 12th consecutive Champions League away match. Another record.

It helped Real win their 10th consecutive Champions League game - a record on par with Bayern Munich, which was set in December 2013. That run was ended by Manchester City, but Ronaldo will be looking to go one further. Beat Schalke at the Bernabeu on March 10, and it's theirs. 

As long as Lionel Messi is around, there will  be the debate as who's better. The race is on with Ronaldo, Messi and Raul level on 76 goals in European competitions. Yet Cristiano has an added incentive. The 30-year-old is now responsible for more than a quarter (72 of 274) of  goals scored by Portuguese players in the history of the Champions League, and won't want to give that up without a fight.

So, can Real become the first European champions to retain the title? The way the records are tumbling for Ronaldo, you wouldn't bet against it.
