He was only 15 when the Great War broke out and ten days later he was aboard the cruiser HMS Monmouth, heading for the coast of Chile.

But when the small naval squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock met a far bigger German force at the Battle of Coronel in 1914, young naval cadet George Muir's early taste of action would be his last.

Ablaze at night and crippled by enemy shells, the Monmouth was caught in the spotlight of the German cruiser Nurnberg, which was hoping she would strike her colours and surrender.

But instead the stricken vessel, with the Edinburgh teenager on board, turned towards the enemy – who then fired into the Monmouth until she capsized, taking all 735 souls on board to a watery grave.

George's heartbroken parents Andrew and Mary received a brutally succinct telegram from the Admiralty – 'Regret that loss Monmouth with all on board must now be presumed' – and their son's posthumous British War Medal. 

But the precious medal passed out of the family's hands and for decades they believed it to be lost – until suddenly it turned up at an auction last year.

It was purchased for a three- figure sum by London-based Royal Navy medals collector Richard Emsley, who understood it had been given up by the family.

But now it will be coming home after he agreed to sell it for what he paid at auction.

Muir's niece Mary Baker, 77, had heard about the sale and contacted auctioneer Dix Noonan Webb, offering to buy it back.

She said: 'It was an emotional moment when I first saw the medal and saw George's name inscribed around the edge. All my family are thrilled about this.'

The medal will now be taken by George's family to a December 8 memorial service in London, marking the centenary of the British defeat at the Battle of Coronel and the Royal Navy's subsequent victory at the Battle of the Falkland Islands.

The Battle of Coronel took place on 1 November 1914 off the coast of central Chile.

A Royal Navy squadron, led by Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock, were defeated by German Imperial Navy forces.

Two Royal Navy armoured cruisers were destroyed and 1,570 men killed in the battle. 

Only three men were injured on enemy forces.

It was Britain's first naval defeat since the Battle of Lake Champlain in 1812 and shock at home to the defeat led to the sending of more ships.

These ships later destroyed the German naval forces  at the Battle of the Falkland Islands.

The medal will then return to Edinburgh where it will remain in the care of George's great-nephew William Muir.

Mr Emsley, a company director, said: 'I was drawn to this medal because George was so young. He was one of the youngest people to be killed during the First World War. 

'It is a highly emotive medal. I was very surprised to hear from the family. 

'I have been collecting for a long time and this has never happened to me before. But as far as I was concerned, there was no doubt that, if the family wanted it back, it should be returned to them.'

A few day's after the death of former Edinburgh Academy pupil George, his father received a letter from a Mrs Brown, from Edinburgh, who had also lost a son in the war.

It prompted Mr Muir to reply: 'It was most kind of you to write such a nice letter of sympathy to us about our little sailor... since the sad news came to us, we have had a letter six weeks old from the boy and it has cheered us up a little because he was so happy and getting on so well.'
