Willie Mullins has turned the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle into a one-man show. The Irish trainer would have won it with Annie Power had she not stumbled at the final fence and thrown off Ruby Walsh but still ended up lifting the prize with stablemate Glens Melody. That makes it seven wins running, Mullins having lifted the prize for the last six seasons with another record-breaker in Quevega before she retired to stud.

It will be a shame if Mullins’ total domination of day one overshadows the first Festival win of trainer Neil Mulholland courtesy of The Druids Nephew in the Ultima Business Solutions Handicap Chase. Mulholland, who runs The Young Master in this afternoon’s RSA Chase, is a trainer going places and now has the Grand National in his sights for The Druids Nephew, who won under Barry Geraghty.

There was no redemption for last year’s unlucky Champion Hurdle third The New One, who could only manage fifth this time around. Jockey Sam Twiston-Davies was adamant that his mount was not himself, describing the feel he gave him as ‘not like him’. His father trainer Nigel will begin a retrieval mission next week but I wonder if Tuesday’s run means The New One will be over fences next season.

Irish trainer Gordon Elliott is more established than Neil Mulholland but his efforts in plotting a route back to the Festival with his National Hunt Chase winner Cause of Causes also deserves praise. The gelding was second at the meeting last year and had run only three times since with his novice status preserved. Elliott also set up a 64th birthday winner for owner JP McManus.

The final race of day one now has the less than snappy name of the CHAPS Restaurant Barbados Novices’ Handicap Chase. Quite a mouthful but Welsh trainer Rebecca Curtis is hoping that might work in her favour after Irish Cavalier won for owner Andrew McIver and gave jockey Paul Townend his second win of the day. Admitting she had never visited the island, Curtis said: ‘Maybe Andrew will take me there now.’
