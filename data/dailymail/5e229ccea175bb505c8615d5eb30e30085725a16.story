Deep rooted problem: Historian Mary Beard believes that female broadcasters must lower their voices to sound like men if they want to be successful

Female broadcasters are forced to ape the deeper more 'authoritative' voices of men or be 'young and pretty' to be successful on radio and TV, historian Mary Beard has said.

Criticising the lack of women in senior positions the academic said the power at the BBC and elsewhere lies 'with the men in suits and their deep voices'.

'It's not a coincidence that even on radio, the successful women presenters tend to have unusually deep (ie male) voices,' she wrote in the Radio Times.

Discussing women on TV she said: 'There are still relatively few and 
they tend to be young and conventionally pretty.

'The fact is that even now authority still seems to reside with the men in suits, and their deep voices; and those are the types we still assume we’ll see when we’re looking for words of wisdom on TV'.

She said that the problem was deep 
rooted, as 'most viewers accept, without a blink, the craggy, wrinkled 
faces and bald patches of male documentary presenters, as if they were 
the signs of mature wisdom, yet in the case of women presenters, grey 
hair and wrinkles often signal "past-my-use-by-date" - or at least 
glaring eccentricity and deficient grooming.'

She praised the likes of former BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders and Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis but admits they are a rarity.

Professor Beard also believes broadcasters must address the position of women across TV, not just on panel shows

Danny Cohen, the BBC's director of television, has vowed to end all-male panel shows, saying that the absence of female guests was 'not acceptable'.

Professor Beard, 59, told the Radio Times that she gave 'two hearty cheers' to Cohen's promise but she added: 'It's not just about panel shows.'

She criticised the 'niche roles for women in sitcoms' and females being placed 'next to the main (male) presenter on the breakfast TV sofa'.

'And
 there can be an outcry when women move into what are perceived as 
traditional male areas. Remember the abuse directed at Jacqui Oatley 
when she dared to 'leave the netball court' and become the first woman 
commentator on Match of the Day,' she said.

Promise: BBC director of television Danny Cohen has pledged to include more women on comedy panel shows

Professor Beard said that the 'underlying 'maleness' of all these shows' was 'more hard-wired in our culture than the presence of a few extra women is likely to solve'.

The television classicist, who has been criticised over her appearance, added: 'Already in Homer's Odyssey, almost 3,000 years ago, we find a wet-behind-the-ears teenager telling his savvy mother not to speak in public.

'Of course, the Greeks and the Romans didn't have panel shows. But the kind of male banter and repartee that we still see in these programmes - its aggression, its 'wit' - does go back thousands of years to ancient dialogue and debate.'

While quotas could 'help in the short term', the presenter said that she dreaded 'any idea of a fixed quota of women per programme', saying: 'It's likely to leave desperate producers ringing round all the women they can possibly think of to fill 'the woman's slot'.'

She said: 'I don't think it would be much fun being the woman vilified in all the reviews as the one taking the quota place.'

Female comedians, including Victoria Wood, have in the past criticised BBC panel shows for being a 'male preserve'.

Her comments came after veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby hit back at claims by comic Dara O Briain that Question Time needs to tackle the gender balance of its panellists, saying he had picked 'the wrong target'.

He defended the show's record for inviting women guests and pointed out the proportions were much higher than those for many areas of public life.

O Briain turned on BBC1's political discussion show in an interview after being asked about the recent decision to ban all-male line-ups for comedy panel shows.

'It's remarkable that this amount of time is spent debating women on comedy shows rather than, say, Question Time,' he said.
