When his 11-month-old Jack Russell vanished down a rabbit hole, the Earl of Cranbrook tried everything he could to find her – to no avail.

By the time the storm of St Jude arrived on Monday, little Domino had been missing for three weeks and the Earl had given up all hope of ever seeing her again.

But half an hour after the storm tore through his 900-acre estate near Saxmundham in Suffolk, a familiar, if bedraggled, figure staggered on to the lawn covered with dirt and sand.

The ferocious storm which caused so 
much destruction had saved Domino by uprooting a tree, allowing her to 
crawl free of the hole she had been stuck in for three weeks.

Last night the Earl’s wife, 
77-year-old Lady Caroline, described the dog’s survival as ‘truly 
remarkable’. She said: ‘The storm hit us at around 8.30am on Monday and 
we were watching the trees bend in the wind.

‘Then about half an hour later, my 
daughter looked out of the window upstairs and saw this yellowish animal
crawling and staggering across the lawn.

‘She screamed when she realised it was Domino and rushed outside to pick her up.

‘Our reaction was one of absolute disbelief. We were all thrilled and flabbergasted that she had returned.

‘It seemed so improbable that she could have survived underground for so long, but we have no other explanation.’

The family believe Domino was rescued by the storm after a tree where she was buried fell down

The fox terrier originated in the 19th century and is related to the modern white terrier breeds.

The dogs were originally bred to dive into and flush foxes out of their holes during foxhunts.

They general grow to no more than 40cm in height and weigh between seven and eight kilograms.

The average lifespan of the dog is around 15 years.

Lady Caroline said Domino was covered 
in sand and her claws were worn down. ‘The sand had got into her eyes 
and she was incredibly skinny,’ she said.

‘The strong winds must have 
shifted the tree roots or something else underground to free her.

‘I have veterinary friends who have never heard of a dog surviving so long underground.

‘They think that the sandy soil might have helped her because she would have been able to drink water dripping through.’

Domino vanished on the afternoon of 
October 7.

The puppy was spotted by her daughter, Flora, 42, from her bedroom window

The fifth Earl, Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 80, had taken her 
out for a walk in the grounds of Great Glemham house when she bolted 
after a rabbit.’

Later Lady Caroline returned to the 
spot with her eldest son Jason Gathorne-Hardy, who has the title Lord 
Medway, and they could hear a faint bark.

Two workers dug with spades 
until nightfall but they could not reach Domino.

Domino is now making a healthy recovery but has not lost her fascination with rabbit holes despite the ordeal

‘The next day we carried on digging 
and brought in the excavator to shift all the sandy soil from the area, 
but we heard absolutely nothing,’ said Lady Caroline.

Lord Medway, 44, 
said he is in no doubt that Domino’s escape was ‘thanks to St Jude’.

‘It is quite fitting that St Jude 
saved her because he is the patron saint of lost causes. She was a lost 
cause if ever there was one – lost and buried underground

The Earl of Cranbrook title was created in 1892 by Conservative politician Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, who held office as Home Secretary at one stage.

The current Lord Cranbrook, who succeeded his father in 1978 to become the fifth earl, has a PhD in the biology of cave swiftlets – the Southeast Asian birds that build edible nests.

The 80-year-old has also held a number of positions in the voluntary, public and private sector.

He has served as an elected parish and district councillor, a member of the Natural Environment Research Council, a trustee of the Natural History Museum and as chairman of the Institute for European Environmental Policy.

Lady Caroline Cranbrook, meanwhile, has made her name as a local food campaigner in Suffolk.

She has served as president of the Aldeburgh Food and Drink Festival, with a mission to encourage people to see where food comes from, and has also worked with the Suffolk Development Agency.

Their son, Jason Gathorne-Hardy, is a nature artist and zoologist.
