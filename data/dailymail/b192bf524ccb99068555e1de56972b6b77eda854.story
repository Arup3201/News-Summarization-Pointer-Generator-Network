President Obama rejected TransCanada's plan to build the Canada to Texas Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, saying he’s denying the application because a GOP-mandated deadline didn’t allow time for a full review.

Mr Obama says his decision isn't a judgment on the merits of the proposed $7billion pipeline.

Rather, he's citing the 'arbitrary nature' of the February  21 deadline that was set by a GOP-written provision in a recent tax bill that Mr Obama signed.

The president said in a statement that he's disappointed that Republicans in Congress forced the decision. 

Mr Obama had until late next month to decide whether the pipeline was in the national interest.

Administration officials says the looming deadline cut short the time needed to conduct environmental reviews after the State Department ordered the project developer to find an alternate route to avoid environmentally sensitive areas of Nebraska.

The $7billion pipeline would run through

passing through an environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska.

According to a source close to the matter: 'The time provided in the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act is not adequate for the Department to gain the additional information needed.' 

‘The Department's recommendation of denial of the ... permit at this time is based on not having the necessary information.

'It does not preclude any subsequent permit application of application for similar project,’ the source told Reuters.

The GOP has pounded Obama over the issue, saying it's a question of whether he wants to create jobs and import energy from an ally, or lose jobs and see Canadian oil go to Asia instead.

The pipeline proposal has forced the White House to make a politically risky choice between two important Democratic constituencies.

Many unions back the project because of the prospects of new jobs in a down economy.

Environmentalists argue that the pipeline would create a risk of calamitous oil spills, as well as an influx of greenhouse gasses.

Some liberal donors threatened to cut off funds to Mr Obama's re-election campaign to protest the project, which opponents say would transport 'dirty oil' that requires huge amounts of energy to extract.

TransCanada says the project could create as many as 20,000 jobs over two years; opponents say that figure is inflated.

A State Department report last summer said the pipeline would create up to 6,000 jobs during construction.
