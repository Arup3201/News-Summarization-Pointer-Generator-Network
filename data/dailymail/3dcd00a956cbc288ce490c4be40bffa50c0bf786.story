The devastated mother of two young boys who were killed by their father who then committed suicide today said her children had 'meant everything to her'.

Heart-broken Victoria Jones, from Andover, in Hampshire, paid a moving tribute to her sons Jack Anderson, 11, and three-year-old brother Bryn after they were discovered dead at their father's home in Tidworth, Wiltshire, on Saturday.

Their father, Graham Anderson, 
36, was found dead in another room at the property.

Ms Jones said Jack as an 
intelligent and sporty little boy with a love for football, maths and 
science who was preparing to start secondary school.

She added: 'He was loved by everyone who met him as he was such a sociable child.

'He was caring and loving towards Bryn and was the best big brother in the world.'

Ms Jones, said younger son Bryn was an animal lover who idolised his big brother.

She said: 'Bryn was a cheeky chappie who doted on and looked up to his elder brother.

'He enjoyed playing in his sandpit and on his trike. He loved animals, especially cats.

'Jack was due to start secondary school this week while Bryn was due to start at playgroup.

'Both Jack and Bryn will be sorely missed by their family and friends. The boys meant everything to me.'

The violent past of the boys' father has also emerged. Anderson had been jailed last year for attacking the boys' mother.

Anderson had hanged himself in another
room. His landlady made the horrific discovery when she let herself in 
to the flat to show prospective tenants around.

Police are trying to determine how and when the children died.

Friends
say Anderson, an unemployed removal man, was a jealous brute whose 
16-year relationship with Miss Jones was punctuated with violence and 
accusations of infidelity.

The 36-year-old is said to have snapped when he found out she had moved on and settled down with another man.

'Everyone knew what he was like,' 
said a school friend. 'He was always violent towards Victoria. He made 
her life a living hell. They were constantly getting into rows and he 
would turn really nasty.

'He was a very jealous type. One time 
after they split up, he went round to her house and smashed the whole 
place up to get back at her. He broke all the windows.

'When he found out Victoria was moving on with someone else, something must have just snapped in his brain.'

Anderson
was jailed for six months last August for multiple assaults on Miss 
Jones and a friend he suspected of sleeping with her. Magistrates in 
Basingstoke, Hampshire, were told he had punched, slapped and pushed the
31-year-old to the ground during a series of violent rows in July last 
year.

Despite the brutality 
Miss Jones appealed for clemency for Anderson, telling magistrates she 
hoped to get the family back together.

However
she had recently formed a new relationship and, in the early hours of 
August 26, changed her status on her Facebook page from single to being 
in a relationship.

Anderson won custody of his sons in May after they had spent some time in foster care.

Detectives
yesterday released a photograph of him in an appeal for help in finding
out what he and his sons were doing in the days before they died.

'It
is very important that we establish the movements of Graham Anderson 
and the boys between Saturday August 25 and Saturday September 1,' said 
Detective Chief Inspector Ian Saunders, who is leading the murder 
investigation.

'We are gathering CCTV footage from shops in Tidworth and from buses which run through the town.

'He
was a regular bus user and I now need to trace his movements and those 
of the boys during the week leading up to the discovery of their bodies 
at lunchtime on Saturday.'

Uniformed officers were still on guard outside the flat yesterday.

Dozens of well-wishers yesterday left flowers and teddy bears at the entrance to the block.

Mr Saunders added: 'We would like to offer our condolences to
their mother Victoria Jones and the boysâ€™ family on the tragic loss of 
Jack and Bryn.

'My officers are working hard to 
piece together the events that led to this appalling outcome so that we 
can pass the fullest possible report to the Coroner.

'I hope now that the photographs of 
the boys and their father are in the public domain that we will hear 
from more people who might have seen them in the seven days leading up 
to the discovery of their bodies on Saturday afternoon.'
