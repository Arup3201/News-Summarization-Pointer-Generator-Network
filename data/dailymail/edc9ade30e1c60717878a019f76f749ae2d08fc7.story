Roy Keane batted off questions from the media regarding the furore which engulfed the camp on Wednesday last week after police were called to the team hotel in Portmarnock following an alleged altercation with another man.

Speaking to the assembled press at the same venue for the first time since the incident, Keane's response when asked if he was prepared to discuss what happened, was: 'No, I'm not.' 

The Republic of Ireland assistant coach insisted the incident would not change his or the squad's routine before big games in the future.

 'No. We go into Malahide and have a coffee, it's fine,' Keane stated. 'We were out last night for a meal, it was fine,' before adding with a flicker of a smile: "We're not One Direction."  

Wearing the same frown he adopted when confronted on the sideline at Celtic Park by match referee Milorad Mazic during Friday night's feisty 1-0 Group D defeat in Glasgow, he was similarly taciturn when asked if the publicity had proved a distraction.

He said: 'No.' 

Shaun Maloney's wonders strike proved decisive as Scotland claimed a 1-0 victory at Celtic Park  

Although police attended, the Football Association of Ireland later insisted at Keane's request, no arrest was made nor complaint received.

The 43-year-old, who was the centre of attention in the build-up to last month's qualifiers against Gibraltar and Germany because of the release of his updated autobiography, remains big news in Ireland, where his partnership with Martin O'Neill captured the imagination when it was announced a little more than a year ago.
