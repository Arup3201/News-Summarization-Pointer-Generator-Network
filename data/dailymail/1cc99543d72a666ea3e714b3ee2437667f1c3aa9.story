They are an uncomfortable combination at the best of times.

But today, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US Secretary of State John Kerry took the ancient clash of East and West to a new level, by wearing clashing shirts to an economic summit in Indonesia.

The two politicians were keeping up the 'silly shirts' trend of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Summit (APEC) by wearing traditional Indonesian clothing - bright green for Mr Putin and purple for Mr Kerry.

Although Barack Obama was being kept busy at home by the ongoing US government shutdown, Mr Kerry embodied the spirit of the regional conference on behalf of the United States in sporting his shirt, which was designed in the Indonesian city of Bali put produced in China.

World leaders attending the conference in recent years, characterised by economic hardship, had skipped on the fancy dress in favour of more traditional businesswear, but the vibrant outfits were back for the summit's latest meeting.

The shirts - made of the native Indonesian fabric endek - were also sported by Chinese Preisdent Xi Jinping and Indoenesian leader Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for the dinner that officially kicked off the meeting.

"After an already busy first day, and tomorrow's tight schedule, let us relax, enjoy the dinner and cultural performance tonight," Mr Yudhoyono said before a gala performance that featured barefoot Balinese dancers and, later, a full-throated rendition of Gangnam Style by two male singers.

The Indonesian premier had already lightened the mood from serious discussion by bringing out his guitar yesterday to serenade Mr Putin.

Mr Yudhoyono, who has a series of albums of love songs to his name, strummed Happy Birthday in honour of the Russian leader's 61st birthday , cheered on by China's leader.

'It was a surprise,' Mr Putin said later to Mr Yudhoyono, adding 'terima kasih', Indonesian for 'thank you'.

The light-hearted tradition of local dress was started in Seattle by President Bill Clinton in 1993, when he handed out leather bomber jackets to visiting leaders in Seattle.

Blue-and-gold South Korean silk overcoats called durumagi were the order of the day in Busan, South Korea, in 2005.

The following year, President George W Bush and Putin donned flowing silk ao dai tunics in Hanoi, Vietnam.

The Balinese designer who made the APEC shirts, Ida Bagus Adnyana, said that the particular pattern used for the leaders 'symbolises harmony and balance'.
