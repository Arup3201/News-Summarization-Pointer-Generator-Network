Kelsey Grammer's wife Kayte has given birth to their first child together.

The Boss actor, 57, and his 32-year-old spouse – who were expecting twins – are 'thrilled' after welcoming a 'healthy baby girl' weighing 6lbs 2oz into the world this morning in Los Angeles, and they have named her Faith Evangeline Elisa Grammer.

But the couple revealed they tragically lost their unborn son shortly after announcing Kayte was pregnant with twins.

In a personal note, they said: 'Early
this morning Kayte gave birth to Faith Evangeline Elisa Grammer.  We 
are thrilled. She was 6lbs 2oz when she entered the world at 1am on the 
13th of July in the year 2012. Mother and child are in excellent 
health.'

'We were ecstatic earlier this year, 
when we announced that Kayte was carrying twins. Tragically we lost the 
little boy shortly thereafter. This was not something we cared to make 
known publicly at the time.' 

'It was unspeakably painful and we 
know that people will understand our desire to keep the news private 
then, as we know they will respect our privacy in this matter now. A 
glorious birth with a lingering sadness is ours today. 

'We choose to celebrate the life that has been given us': The pair released an emotional statement today

'We choose to celebrate the life that
has been given us. We proudly introduce our Faith to the world today 
looking forward to the days ahead and the children yet to come.'

The couple – who got married in 
February 2011 and renewed their vows in June – previously lost a child 
when Kayte suffered a miscarriage in 2010.

Kelsey already has four kids, 
Spencer, 28, and Greer, 19, from previous relationships and 10-year-old 
Mason and Jude, seven, with ex-wife Camille Donatacci.

The couple went public with their romance just weeks after he split from the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star.
