The East Winsdor gun store which sourced at least one of the guns used in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was raided  by federal firearms agents last night.

Officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) swooped on Riverside Gun Sales at 5pm yesterday evening, as officers from East Police Department cordoned off the plaza.

The raid was a result of security worries at the store after it was revealed the premises had been robbed of a rifle similar to the one used in the Newtown shooting, just four days before the tragedy.

Jordan Marsh, 26, is reported to be suffering from serious mental health problems and was off medication when he was arrested

Police say that Riverside Gun Sales have failed to account for over 30 missing guns since 2007

A news website showed video footage of 26 year old Jordan Marsh removing the 50 calibre long gun from the store. 

Marsh was caught by local police and the AR15 was recovered in a duffel bag at the Hartford Hilton on Saturday.

The girlfriend of Marsh's father, Sarah Hodge, spoke of her shock on seeing the reports and footage of the theft.

Federal agents are now concerned about the store's security after Marsh was able to walk out with the gun

Store management said they didn't notice the gun was missing until police contacted them after the gun was found in a nearby hotel

'It's unbelievable,' Ms Hodge said. 

Marsh had been staying with ms Hodge for the previous two years, and she said the 26 year old had suffered from Schizophrenia, and other mental issues. Marsh had been off his medication at the time of Saturday's arrest. 

She added that she was happy the young man had been caught: 'I'm sorry Jordan but you need help.'

Police said Riverview Gun Sales had no idea the AR-15 Marsh stole was missing. Management at the store didn't know about 11 guns that Marsh had allegedly stolen last year until they were notified by detectives. 

Inventory control issues at Riverview Gun Sales have occurred before. In 2007, state police raided a Somers home and found a bunch of stolen guns from the store.

'It was found that the same Riverview gun store was missing upwards of 30-plus guns,' said East Windsor police Detective Matthew Carl.
