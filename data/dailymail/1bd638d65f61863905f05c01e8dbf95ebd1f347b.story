Scientists have captured the first ever video footage of one of the least known and most elusive wild cats on earth.

The African golden cat was recorded by a camera trap hunting during daylight in Kibale National Park, Uganda.

This new footage shows an African golden cat hunting red colobus monkeys gathered around and feeding on the dead wood of a tree stump. 

This new footage shows an African golden cat hunting red colobus monkey. It attacks a group of red colobus monkey gathered around a tree stump,causing them to scatter (left image) leaping in from the left (middle) before fighting with one. Eventually, it retreats, leaping back over the log to make its escape (right).

The African golden cat is found only in the forests of Central and West Africa, and grows to the size of a bobcat, weighing between 5-16 kilograms. 

Very few western scientists have observed the living animal in the wild and almost all records of the African golden cat consist of photographs taken by remote camera traps, or of dead animals (usually killed by local hunters).

The forest-dwelling species is threatened across its range by intensive bushmeat hunting (the hunting of wild animals for meat) and loss of habitat due to deforestation.

It was recorded with a camera trap set by Samuel Angedakin, Kibale Project Manager for the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology's Pan African Programme: The Cultured Chimpanzee, in collaboration with the Ngogo Chimpanzee Project, Uganda Wildlife Authority and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology. 

'It is an exciting and rare glimpse into the world of this fascinating cat,' said Kaplan scholar and graduate student, David Mills.

'We know a lot more about golden cats than we did a few years ago and yet we still know almost nothing about their behaviour. 

'Primatologists in Kibale have observed monkeys emitting alarm calls at golden cats on several occasions and, considering this latest evidence, it's not hard to see why.'

Kaplan Scholar and graduate student, Laila Bahaa-el-din, said , 'An adult red colobus monkey is a considerable opponent for an African golden cat. 

'With the golden cat failing to make a fatal bite immediately on ambush, it had to make a hasty retreat.'

'Watching a golden cat in full ambush of large monkeys in this video provides hunting details we could previously only piece together from brief sightings. 

'It also portrays nicely why monkeys might mob a golden cat, as can be seen in the unique footage of a golden cat trying in vain to catch a cat nap while precariously perched in the fork of a tree.'

Further footage, this time of a golden cat sleeping in a tree, has been recorded by Yasuko Tashiro of the Primate Research Institute at Kyoto University. 

The video was recorded in the Kalinzu Forest Reserve, Uganda, and shows monkeys surrounding the golden cat and harassing it until it descends from the tree.

The forest-dwelling species is threatened across its range by intensive bushmeat hunting

A recently published review paper on African golden cats summarises the current state of knowledge of the species and provides preliminary results from two studies supported by Panthera, a global wild cat conservation organization. 

Today, this forest-dwelling species is threatened across its range by intensive bushmeat hunting (the hunting of wild animals for meat) and loss of habitat due to deforestation
