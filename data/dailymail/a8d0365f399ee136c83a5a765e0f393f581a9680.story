Police in Los Angeles announced Tuesday that two young women who were discovered dead nine months apart three years were abducted and murdered by the same perpetrator.

Michelle Lozano, 17, was kidnapped from Lincoln High School in April 2011. Her nude body was discovered dumped the next day on the 5 Freeway near the Los Angeles Cesar Chavez Avenue exit.

In January 2012, 22-year-old Bree'Anna Guzman, a mother of two, was discovered dead near the 5 and 2 Freeway interchange a month after being reported missing.

Crime scene: Guzman's badly decomposed and partially nude body turned up along the Riverside Drive on-ramp in January 2012 - a month after her disappearance

The two murders were not originally linked by investigators, but during a press conference Tuesday, LAPD Capt. William Hayes said that forensic evidence collected from the two crime scenes has led police to conclude that both crimes were committed by the same person.

Police say they have no descriptions of a suspect or a vehicle, and are now appealing to the public to come forward with clues, Los Angeles Times reported.

The Los Angeles City Council announced two $50,000 rewards for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the slayings.

‘We know that there are people out there that know something and we just need their help,’ Anne Flores, Lozano’s sister, said during Tuesday’s emotional press conference attended by relatives of both victims.

Michelle Lozano was last seen alive at around 4pm on April 24, 2011, on North Broadway in Lincoln Heights.

Public plea: LAPD and City Council officials held a press conference attended by the victims' families, where they announced a $100,000 reward for information leading to the killer's arrest

At around 11.30pm the following day, the teen's naked body was discovered wrapped in plastic and stuffed inside a container in the brush just off the 5 Freeway.

The medical examiner determined that the 17-year-old high school student had been strangled to death by her assailant.

Bree'Anna Guzman was last seen just before 8pm December 26, 2011, when she told her mother, Darlene, that she was going to get cough drops from a Rite Aid pharmacy in Lincoln Heights.

On January 26, Guzman's badly decomposed and partially nude body turned up along the Riverside Drive on-ramp.

Bree'Anna's mother was on hand for the Tuesday police news conference announcing a break in the murder cases.

'She was loved by some many people,' Guzman said, sporting a T-shirt with her daughter's picture.

It does not appear like the 17-year-old Lozano and 22-year-old Guzman knew each other, according to KTLA.

LA Weekly reported that there have been reports of other unsolved cases involving bodies discarded on the Eastside of LA and around Los Angeles County, but so far no connections have been detected between Lozano and Guzman's murders, and the other alleged victims.  

Detectives are now checking databases in Southern California and beyond to look for similar cases in an effort to determine if a serial killer may be behind Guzman and Lozano's deaths, NBC 4 reported.
