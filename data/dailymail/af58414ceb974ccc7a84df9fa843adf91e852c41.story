A girl of three died of dehydration after a locum doctor in a casualty unit sent her home without doing basic tests that would have saved her life, an inquest was told.

Mylee Ward should have been admitted to hospital and given fluids after being sick and barely able to eat or drink for three days.

Instead the doctor, who had treated a large number of children that week with sickness bugs, sent the youngster home with antibiotics.

Failings: Mylee Ward of dehydration after a doctor failed to carry out basic tests after she was rushed to hospital by paramedics

Around 36 hours later, her mother 
Terrina-Ann Laughton and father Kevin Ward were considering taking her 
back to hospital when she found the youngster unconscious in her 
playpen.

‘I was hysterical,’ she said. ‘We lay her flat on the floor but could not get any response.’

A doctor called to the family home in Chesterfield pronounced the girl 
dead. In a narrative verdict, coroner Robert Hunter ruled that Mylee 
died due to dehydration contributed to by neglect.

He criticised Dr Mushfikur Rahman for his failure to treat the girl properly.

The coroner told the inquest in Chesterfield: ‘Had she been admitted and fluids given, on balance she would have survived.’

The child was taken to Chesterfield Royal Hospital in March last year after being seen by a  paramedic at home.

Mylee was laid across two chairs, instead of being found a trolley, and 
examined by Dr Rahman, who should have carried out a simple blood or 
urine test to check for dehydration. ‘These are basic medical checks, 
nothing complex or sophisticated,’ said the coroner.

Dr Rahman, who sent Mylee home at 1am, admitted there were ‘lots of things he missed’.

Mylee, who was born with brain damage and was unable to walk or talk, 
was described by her mother as a ‘happy, cheerful, giggly little girl’.

Fatal mistake: Mylee was taken to Chesterfield Royal Hospital but once there after being laid across the two chairs Dr Rahman 'failed to carry out basic bedside tests,' said the coroner

After the hearing, Miss Laughton, 39, 
who has four other children, said she had received no apology or contact
 from the hospital.

Asked about Dr Rahman, she said: ‘I think every day that if he had done 
his job properly Mylee would still be alive.’ A spokesman for the 
hospital said the doctor had not worked there since Mylee’s death and 
concerns had been passed to the agency that supplied him.

He said the hospital wanted to pass on ‘our sincere and unreserved apologies’ that aspects of the girl’s treatment ‘were poor’.

Changes to staffing and procedures had been made as a result of the tragedy.
