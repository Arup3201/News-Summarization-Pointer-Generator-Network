You won’t hear Tristram Hunt, Labour’s new education spokesman, trotting out Labour’s jibe that David Cameron is a ‘posh boy who doesn’t know the cost of a pint of milk’.

Because the urbane and artfully tousled Hunt, 39, is every bit as posh as the Prime Minister.

Fees at his alma mater, University College School in Hampstead, North London, are nearly £18,000 a year. It is a member of the ‘Eton Group’ of elite private schools and to get in you have to pass a gruelling exam.

Ambition: Tristram Hunt, Labour's new Shadow Secretary of State for Education, interacts with pupils during a visit to a children's breakfast club at Richard Atkins Primary School in Brixton, London

Hunt went to Trinity College, Cambridge, the same college as his father, Baron Hunt of Chesterton, a Labour peer and Companion of the Order of the Bath. It was thanks to his dad’s Royal connections that Hunt was able to marry wife Juliet at Westminster Abbey, where William and Kate walked down the aisle.

Add a commanding height of 6ft 3in, languid good looks that made him a TV success as the ‘Naked Historian’, and Peter Mandelson as a Labour ‘Godfather’, and it is not surprising he oozes charm and confidence.

Yet, sitting in his cramped Commons study, Hunt begins the interview, his first since being appointed Shadow Education Secretary in Ed Miliband’s reshuffle, with a public apology.

When Michael Gove launched his free schools revolution after the 2010 Election, allowing parents to set up new schools and breaking the stranglehold of teachers’ unions and town hall chiefs, Labour claimed it was a wicked plot to let middle-class parents set up elitist state schools where their pampered children studied Latin while council estate kids were condemned to ‘bog-standard comprehensives’.

Days after becoming the newly elected MP for Stoke-on-Trent, excitable new boy Hunt called free schools a ‘vanity project for yummy mummies’.

Partner: Mr Hunt's wife Juliet Thornback, who owns a successful homeware company could be a Labour 'SamCam' in the making

Now he wants to eat his words. ‘I regret those comments because I think any parents, be they yummy mummies or .  .  . ’ he searches for the male equivalent, ‘ .  .  . or faddy daddies, involved in the education of their children is great.’

Instead of mocking Gove, Hunt now wants to mirror him, by promising Labour’s own ‘parent power’ revolution in schools.

He wants to bury the idea that Labour is in the pockets of teachers’ unions and Lefty town hall chiefs after the party’s pollsters discovered Gove’s policy is a vote winner.

Labour’s schools will be called ‘parent-led academies’ (PLAs) – not free schools. But it’s a case of spot the difference.

It is a highly significant moment. Miliband’s party conference speech, in which he vowed to freeze energy prices, was seen as a lurch to the Left, as was his decision last week to demote three Blairite members of his Shadow Cabinet.

Yet the appointment of Blairite young gun Hunt, and ending attacks on ‘yummy mummies’ who set up their own schools, suggests ‘Red Ed’ is willing to steal the Tories’ clothing if he thinks it will win him votes.

Like free schools, PLAs will be set up by local parents and teachers and will be able to set their own curriculum, decide teachers’ pay and have their own ‘ethos’.

However, unlike free schools, PLAs will only be allowed where there is a shortage of school places; town halls will still be able to step in – though only in a crisis – and there will be curbs on ‘untrained’ teachers.

Hunt says the checks will stop scandals such as the closure of  the Muslim Al-Madinah free school in Derby following claims of  discrimination against female staff and pupils.

But make no mistake, PLAs are meant to be seen as ‘Labour’s free schools’. ‘There are lots of parents out there who want to set up schools,’ says Hunt.

‘What I am saying is if you want to do that when we are in government we will be on your side. There has been this perception that we would not be, and I want people to be absolutely clear that we are. I am putting rocket boosters on getting behind parents and social entrepreneurs.

‘We are not going to go back to the old days of the local authority running all the schools – they will not be  in charge.’

Taunt: Mr Hunt has accused his opposite number Michael Gove of acting like Napoleon when it comes to education policy in Whitehall

Far from shutting down Gove’s ‘yummy mummy schools’ if Labour wins, Hunt wants more of them.

‘We will keep those free schools going. We aren’t in the business of taking them down. We have to clear up this question which has dogged Labour education policy since we entered opposition and since Michael Gove began his reforms, as to what we’d do. We just want to say, “You are setting up these schools, we are behind you.” ’

Hunt has praised the successful free school set up in East London by his friend, Peter Hyman, Tony Blair’s former No 10 aide.

Would he let Hyman set up a primary school feeder to his existing secondary free school? ‘Yes.’

Even if it is a free school? He interjects: ‘We would be calling them parent-led academies.’

Will PLAs offer everything free schools have got? ‘Yes, but in an area of need, absolutely,’ Hunt enthuses. ‘The innovation, creativity, community engagement you  see in the best free schools – great, let’s have more.’

Controversy: The new Shadow Education Secretary once referred to David Starkey as a 'gossip columnist' historian, prompting the academic to say Mr Hunt was more eye candy than IQ

To ram home the point, Hunt says he would happily send his three young children to a free school.

Gove will argue that by giving town halls even a small role, Labour’s PLAs are not truly free but still enslaved to the Left-wing educational establishment he despises.

Hunt counters by claiming that by running free schools from Whitehall, Gove is acting ‘like ‘Napoleon’.

‘When things go wrong at a free school it has to go straight to the Minister down the road like a  Napoleon telling these kids what to do,’ he scoffs.

Gove, the state-educated, adopted son of an Aberdonian fishmonger, loves to taunt ‘privately educated’ Hunt in private. ‘I get under Michael’s skin,’ he says.

In return, he has called Gove ‘Blair’s bastard acolyte’ for claiming free schools are a continuation of Blair’s academies.

Hunt once got under TV rival David Starkey’s skin, cheekily calling him a ‘gossip columnist’ historian, prompting Starkey to  suggest Hunt was more eye candy than IQ.

Teasing Tories for following Blair is a bit rich considering Hunt’s undying devotion.  ‘Tony Blair was a great Prime Minister,’ he says.

So is he the true heir to Blair, a future leader, as Labour admirers claim? ‘No, partly for psychological reasons,’ he reflects. ‘Tony had a messianic quality, a driven quality – not in that he was the Messiah!’ Hunt erupts with laughter, ‘but a driven, absolute inner eye. Am I the new Tony Blair? I don’t think that would be true.’

He would have you believe he is too cerebral for the ruthlessness  of leadership.

Or does the soft-spoken, self- deprecating demeanour mask the deadly ambition of other well-mannered public schoolboy politicians such as Blair and Cameron?

Hunt’s Cameronesque qualities extends to his own ‘yummy mummy’ wife, Juliet Thornback, a Labour ‘SamCam’ in the making.

Even more blonde and willowy than her husband, she co-owns the trendy Thornback & Peel homeware company whose first success was  a designer handbag, just like Mrs Cameron, who designs handbags for her own upmarket label Smythson.

B&Q it is not: Thornback & Peel wallpaper sells for £70 a roll and silk cushions for £55.

Proud husband Hunt declares: ‘She is a very hard-working, successful small businesswoman worried about cash flow and big companies not paying their bills within 60 days – while raising three kids. I’m full of admiration for her.’ Dave says the same about Sam.

As a rather grand commentator on constitutional affairs, Hunt has  frequently doled out advice to the Royals. Indeed, if he did so to a camera lens outside Buckingham Palace he is more likely to be mistaken for Prince William than Ed Miliband.

He laughs when I suggest he is probably one of the few who knows as much about Marxism as Miliband’s father, Marxist academic Ralph, did. Hunt wrote a highly acclaimed book about his hero,  Friedrich Engels, who co-founded Communism with Karl Marx.

While planting the seeds of a worldwide workers’ revolt from England, German-born Engels simultaneously indulged his passion for riding to hounds. Does English gent Hunt share Engels’s love of fox-hunting? Envisaging an embarrassing fall at his first fence, novice political chaser Hunt mumbles something vague about fox-hunting being ‘part of English culture’.

It’s not a ‘yes’, though it might sound like it to a traditional Tory supporter tempted to vote Labour. On the other hand, an anti-bloodsports Labour voter might interpret it as ‘no’.

Which is how Tony Blair won three elections for Labour.
