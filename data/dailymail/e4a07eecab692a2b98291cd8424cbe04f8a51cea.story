After a busy couple of weeks campaigning for the Democrats in the run up to the midterm elections, Michelle Obama looked happy to be back on safer ground on Monday when she attended several non-political events including an award ceremony for after school programs at the White House.

With her husband’s approval ratings at a record low, the first lady was on the campaign trail in Iowa, Florida, Wisconsin, Maine and other states ahead of last Wednesday’s elections in a bid to try and rally Democrat supporters.

With the disappointment of the party's poor election cycle behind her, she looked radiant in a sleeve-less black top and multi-colored skirt as she returned to more typical first lady business on Monday.

In Arlington, Virginia, she spoke at a career development forum for women veterans transitioning to civilian life and encouraged them to be bold in their next career step.

‘If you want a job, you can't be modest. You've got to show off a little bit,’ she said. ‘And believe me, you all have so much to show off.’

On the eve of Veterans Day, she announced new commitments from online networks LinkedIn and Coursera in partnering with the government to help service members and veterans.

After that she rushed back to the White House when she presented national arts and humanities awards to 12 after-school programs from across the country and one international program.

The first lady thanked the art educators for not only teaching children skills, but for putting a 'spring in their step' and giving them something to look forward to after school.

The White House ceremony included a head-bopping musical performance from the Delta Blues Museum Arts and Education Program Band of Clarksdale, Mississippi, and remarks by 16-year-old Jennifer Guadalupe Gonzalez of Chicago, who explained how acting in a Shakespeare production gave her a boost of confidence.

The 2014 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards are hosted by the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities in partnership with three national cultural agencies.

Afterwards the first lady also made the time to speak at another White House event for military children and families.

Once again she spoke to the families present before the screening a special Veteran's Day episode of Disney's Doc McStuffins, that explored the emotions children face when a parent is deployed.

Prior to last Wednesday’s midterms, Michelle Obama has been on a whirlwind tour of the country since September, appearing roughly 40 times with Democratic candidates.

While only 41 percent of Americans approve of the president’s job, some 62 percent of respondents in a July Pew Research Center poll said they had a favorable view of the first lady.

'She just tells a different story, because she's not a politician and she's not an elected official,' Jim Demers, a Democratic lobbyist, told the Wall Street Journal.
