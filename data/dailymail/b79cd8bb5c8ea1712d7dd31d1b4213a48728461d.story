A painkiller taken by millions can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke by 40 per cent, a study has found.

Researchers say that while there is no need for patients to panic, diclofenac should be restricted to prescription only.

In completely healthy patients, a 40 per cent raised chance of heart problems is not at all significant. But for those who already have a high risk of a heart attack or stroke, taking the painkiller could present serious problems.

Researchers say that while there is no need for patients to panic, diclofenac should be restricted to prescription only. The drug is given to 6million patients

Last night the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said that patients should not stop taking the drug, but should consult their doctor if they have fears over its safety.

Last year almost 17million prescriptions were written by GPs in England for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, for conditions such as arthritis, back pain, gout, headaches and fever.

Of these, diclofenac was the most commonly prescribed and given to 6million patients.

It can also be bought over-the-counter under the brand name Voltarol Pain-Eze for around £6. It is at lower strength but still carries a 22 per cent higher risk.

Dr Patricia McGettigan of Hull York Medical School, who led the landmark review of studies looking at nearly 3million people, said: ‘Diclofenac on prescription was associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk of 40 per cent.

‘People take it because it’s 
effective, but it’s very important for patients and doctors to know the 
risks associated with these drugs for high-risk patients.

‘It is now available over the counter, and our study suggests there is a case for looking at that again and making it prescription-only as well as strengthening advice to doctors and patients about how it should be used.

‘There is a very clear increase in risk as the dose goes up, which says to people who perhaps can’t get out of bed due to arthritis and take diclofenac, take a different drug instead and you might be at a lower risk of heart attack and stroke.

‘We have reviewed all the previous studies and are confident that the results are robust enough to inform clinical and regulatory decisions.’ 

This is the first study to measure the relative risks of different drugs, and it found that ibuprofen and naproxen had the lowest risk of cardiovascular problems.

Many patients were transferred to 
diclofenac from Vioxx, the painkiller which was withdrawn by 
manufacturer Merck in 2004 after it was linked to heart attacks and 
strokes.

Patients will 
often be at minimal risk. For a young woman, the risk of having a heart 
attack will be around 0.1 per cent and a 40 per cent rise is still just 
0.14 per cent.

However for a pensioner who has already had one heart attack, a 40 per cent increase could be significant.

Doreen Maddock of the British Heart 
Foundation said: ‘The potential risks for heart patients taking certain 
painkillers have been known for some time and these findings shouldn’t 
be ignored. But scientists and drug regulators will need to delve deeper
before we draw any firm conclusions.

‘As with any medicine there are benefits
and potential risks to taking painkillers. If you’re already taking 
these types of drugs and are worried, don’t simply give up on your 
medication. You should always speak to your doctor first because the 
benefits may well outweigh the risks for you.’

A spokesman for the MHRA said: ‘Our 
priority is to ensure that the benefits of medication outweigh the 
risks. NSAID treatment is associated with a small increased risk of 
heart attacks and stroke. The risk is higher with long-term treatment.

‘Clear warnings about the risk of gastro-intestinal and heart problems, along with information about those patient groups in which NSAIDs either should not be used, such as those with severe heart failure, or only used with caution, are contained in the product information including the patient information leaflet that accompanies the medicine.

‘To minimise the risk of side effects, all NSAIDs should be used at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period necessary to control symptoms. 

‘People should not stop taking their NSAID medicine, but if they have any questions or concerns about their treatment they should speak to their doctor. 

‘The MHRA keeps the safety of NSAIDs under close review and any new data will be carefully evaluated.’

A spokesman for Novartis, which makes Voltarol, said: ‘In our view, this analysis, in the context of the vast clinical experience worldwide, does not change the favourable benefit-to-risk assessment for diclofenac when used as directed. 

‘Novartis is confident about the safety profile of diclofenac products.’
