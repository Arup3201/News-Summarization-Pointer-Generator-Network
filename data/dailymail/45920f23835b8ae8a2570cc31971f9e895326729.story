Rick Santorum has abruptly suspended his White House bid, effectively ending the battle for the Republican presidential nomination and allowing a victorious Mitt Romney to focus solely on defeating Barack Obama in November.

The former US Senator for Pennsylvania won 11 states but had dropped to a very distant second place in the delegate count.

He did not mention Romney once in a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, site of the historic Civil War battle, in which he announced his candidacy was over, fuelling Republican fears that there could be continued disunity in the party.

Dropping out: Surrounded by his family, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum announced on Tuesday that he is suspending his campaign for the Republican presidential candidacy

'We made a decision over the weekend that, while this presidential race for us is over, for me, and we will suspend our campaign effective today, we are not done fighting,' he said at a news conference hastily arranged instead of a planned rally.

Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul officially remain in the race but have no hope of denying Romney, who now becomes the presumptive Republican nominee before being formally anointed at the Republican convention in Tampa in August, which party bosses had feared might degenerate into an ugly fight.

Santorum, 53, had looked like he would be an also-ran for most of the Republican campaign but surged to a very narrow – though belatedly announced – victory in first-voting Iowa in January.

After a stunning triple win in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri in February he briefly looked like he could topple Romney, 65, the long-time establishment favourite.

He displaced Gingrich as the main 
conservative threat to Romney but his failure to win in the battleground
states of Michigan and Ohio meant his challenge quickly faded.

When
Santorum suffered three defeats last Tuesday in Wisconsin, Maryland and
the District of Columbia, his presidential hopes for 2012 were all but 
over.

Emotional: Santorum embraced his wife Karen, who had struggled to contain her tears, after the speech

Stubborn: Santorum did not endorse frontrunner Mitt Romney - or even mention him - in his departure speech

His daughter Bella, three, who suffers from a rare and usually fatal genetic disorder, was hospitalised on Friday, prompting Santorum to leave the campaign trail.

In his speech, Santorum said that Good 
Friday was 'a passion play' for his family because of Bella’s illness of
Bella and Easter weekend then became 'a time for prayer and thought' 
about his campaign.

Bella, who was also hospitalised in February, returned home yesterday.

Santorum opened the press conference 
on Tuesday with news of his daughter, and how consideration for her had 
been part of his decision to step down.

He
said of Bella: 'She is a fighter, she is doing exceptionally well and 
we are looking forward to spending a lot of great time with her.

'But it did cause us to think as the role we have is parents in her life. This was a time for prayer and thought this weekend. We were very concerned about being the best parents we possibly could to our children.'

Referring 
to his initial prospects and the fact that most commentators had 
dismissed his chances, Santorum described his presidential bid as being 
'as improbable as any race you’ll ever see for president'.

Tough competition: It is believed that the move leaves the way open for frontrunner Mitt Romney to stand almost unopposed to take on President Obama later this year

For months, Santorum had pounded Romney for being insufficiently conservative and a weak candidate to face Obama.

In his speech, he talked of fighting to 
ensure Republicans held the House of Representatives and won back the 
Senate but did not mention the White House. 'This game is a long, long, 
long way from over,' he said.

Just after the announcement, Romney 
issued a somewhat tepid statement: 'Senator Santorum is an able and 
worthy competitor, and I congratulate him on the campaign he ran.

'He
has proven himself to be an important voice in our party and in the 
nation. We both recognise that what is most important is putting the 
failures of the last three years behind us and setting America back on 
the path to prosperity.'

Catalyst: During the speech, Santorum said he was committed to being the best parent to Bella he could be

Fighter: Santorum's daughter is now out of hospital, where she was being treated for pneumonia

Santorum telephoned Romney before
his speech to inform him of his decision. The former senator’s 
spokesman Hogan Gidley later told MSNBC that the Romney campaign had 
asked for a meeting about an endorsement and that Santorum would be 
'open' to this.

Rival Ron Paul congratulated Santorum on his 'spirited campaign', while Newt Gingrich called his fight 'remarkable'.

Gingrich vowed to remain in the until the convention to give conservatives 'a real choice'.

Although
best known as a strong social conservative with outspoken views against
abortion and gay marriage, Santorum also campaigned as a foreign policy
hawk and emphasised his blue-collar roots.

He
hinted at sore feelings towards Romney, who had defeated him partly 
with the aid of a huge war chest that enabled him to buy some 
devastating negative ads.

'We
weren't out there trashing anybody…We painted a hopeful, positive 
vision for our country,' he said. Santorum also pointed out that he won 
'more counties' that the other Republican candidates combined, an 
indication of his strength among rural voters.

But despite his wins in 11 states, 
Santorum’s vote tally was 3.2 million votes compared to Romney’s  4.6 
million . In the one measure that really counted, Santorum netted 285 
convention delegate compared to Romney’s 661 thus far. A candidate must 
get 1,144 delegates to clinch the nomination.

Santorum’s exit came as the Romney 
campaign was preparing to air a barrage of negative ads against him in 
Pennsylvania. It took senior Republicans by surprise, though a number 
had counselled that he had to avoid losing in Pennsylvania at all costs.

Having begun his candidacy as a second 
or even third tier prospect, Santorum is young enough to look forward to
being a front-rank contender in 2016, should Romney lose to Obama, or 
2020.

Support: Santorum had enjoyed wins in Iowa, Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri during the campaign

'We are not done fighting,' he said. 'We are going to continue to fight for those voices…. There’s a lot of greatness, a lot of greatness in this country.'

His campaign, he emphasised, had begun with a discussion around the family’s kitchen table and had ended the same way.

'It was a love affair for me, going from state to state and seeing the differences, but seeing the wonderful, wonderful people of this country,' he said.

By ‘suspending’ his campaign rather than formally ending it, Santorum can continue to collect contributions to pay off his campaign debts.

Stepping down ahead of the Pennsylvania primary in two weeks,
which could have proved a humiliating defeat on his home turf, Rick Santorum has left
the campaign at a high point.

Having collected 11 states and thousands of voters, the
former Pennsylvania senator is now well-placed to manipulate his popularity to
further his career – whether it be in politics or elsewhere.

A comparison can perhaps be drawn with Mike Huckabee, the former
governor of Arkansas and a candidate in the 2008 Republican presidential race, eventually
won by John McCain.

Like Santorum, Huckabee enjoyed early success in Iowa, followed
by wins in Louisiana, Kansas and West Virginia. But he bowed out in early March
as it became increasingly clear it would be tough to forge a win in Texas.

Following his campaign, Huckabee has courted controversy yet has
also enjoyed success, publishing a New York Times bestseller and writing another, non-political book.

In June 2008, he
was hired by Fox News as a political commentator and contributor for their
election coverage. He now hosts a weekend show called Huckabee on Fox News
Channel.

Other one-time candidates, such as Alan Keyes, have also enjoyed relative success as talk show hosts and commentators after their failed bids.

For many other candidates - both those who have enjoyed success and those who have not - returning for later presidential elections is a theme.

Two candidates who took part in the 2008 bid for Republican presidential candidate - Ron Paul and today's front-runner Mitt Romney - returned this year.

Arizona Sentor John McCain came back from second place in 2000 to take the candidacy in 2008.

Other names such as Herman Cain, Steve Forbes and John Edwards crop up over more than one year, signalling Santorum could be back in 2016 - providing Romney is not at the helm.

Remaining in politics is an option, as is lobbying. Looking further back to 2004 - and therefore jumping sides to a Democratic battle - candidates who bowed out turned towards lobbying.

Dick Gephardt,
a man mentioned as possible vice president in five separate campaign 
years, was considered a strong candidate when he entered the race, 
eventually won by John Kerry.

Dropping out after finishing in fourth 
place, he went on to set up a consultancy and lobbying group, and has 
lobbied on behalf of pharmaceutical companies and Boeing - to mixed 
reactions.

Whatever Santorum decides to do, he has business to attend to first. Following his announcement on Tuesday he immediately appealed to supporters to help pay off his campaign debt.

'I am planning to do everything in my power to bring a change about in the White House,' he wrote in a campaign email. 'But our campaign has debt, and I cannot be free to focus on helping defeat him with this burden.'
