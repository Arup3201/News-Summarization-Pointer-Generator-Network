Manuel Pellegrini is set to welcome captain Vincent Kompany back into the Manchester City side for Saturday's Premier League clash with Leicester at the King Power Stadium.

Kompany has not featured for the champions this month since injuring his hamstring during the 3-0 win against Southampton in November.

And after missing crucial games against Everton last weekend and Wednesday's European showdown with Roma, Pellegrini revealed Kompany is available for selection again.

'Kompany is in the squad list so I don’t think he will have any problem to play tomorrow.'

The City boss was also optimistic about David Silva making his Premier League return after coming on as a second-half substitute against Roma on Wednesday.

'We will see tomorrow, he didn’t feel any pain in the knee from the 30 minutes [in Rome] so I think he will be fit.'

VIDEO We are more than Aguero - Pellegrini

Man City go into Saturday's game on the back of six consecutive wins in all competitions and Pellegrini has called for his side to match the performance levels of recent weeks against Leicester.

'Leicester are a good team with good players and I think tomorrow we will have a tough game.'

'We must think that if we want to win we must play in the same way as we have been doing.'

The Chilean reiterated his belief that his side can cope with the loss of Sergio Aguero, who is set for a spell on the sidelines after injuring his knee against Everton last week.

'Sergio is a very important player, but I don’t think this team depends just on Aguero.'

Pellegrini confirmed that Joe Hart is close to singing a new contract at Manchester City

Meanwhile, the City boss has confirmed that goalkeeper Joe Hart is close to signing a new contract with the club, and the Chilean remains hopeful that James Milner will follow suit and put pen to paper on a new deal.

'I think it is close,' Pellegrini said of Hart's new contract. 'Joe wants to stay here and we want him to be our goalkeeper.'

'I hope Milner will sign also. I think he will continue here because he also wants to stay.'
