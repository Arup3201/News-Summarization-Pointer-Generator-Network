A dad accused of killing his 10-week-old baby has claimed that his miniature dachshund tripped him, causing him to fall on the child.

The murder trial of Anthony Casanova, 41, began in Muskegon, Michigan on Tuesday, 20 months after the death of his baby son, Tyler, at their home in Norton Shores in January 2013.

Casanova has claimed he was holding Tyler in one arm and letting his dog in through a glass door, when the pet ran between his legs, tripping him and causing him to drop the baby on the carpet and then fall on top of him, Mlive reported.

But in court, jurors heard how, during a three-hour interview with cops, Casanova eventually said that he had squeezed the crying baby twice before hitting his head against a bed multiple times.

Police and fire officials were dispatched to the home around 4pm on January 4, 2013 and found the baby not breathing. 

Detective Anthony Nanna previously told the court that, after hours of interviewing Casanova, the father admitted he had 'lost it' and squeezed the boy.

He then took his son into the living room to make it appear as if the incident had happened there.

Nanna attended the child's autopsy, where the doctor showed him previous and more-recent broken ribs, a lacerated liver, skull fracture, and bleeding on the brain.

On Wednesday, the jury members were to hear a recording of the apparent confession, which Casanova's defense team insists he only made after little sleep and much heartbreak.

In court, the Norton Shores fire chief, a police officer, a police sergeant and a paramedic all testified that Casanova told them the same story about tripping and falling on the boy.

The only difference between the stories was that, while he told most he dropped the boy and then fell on him, the fire chief remembers Casanova saying the two fell together. 

They also testified that bruises on the boy's chin and body appeared to be semi-healed, suggesting that they were not newly inflicted.

Prosecutor D.J. Hilson has said he believes Casanova should be found guilty of first-degree murder, which comes with a mandatory life sentence.

To secure this, prosecutors must show the dad intended to kill the boy or showed 'willful and wanton disregard' for the fact that he could harm or kill the baby.

Hilson said he will prove that the boy had received multiple injuries, saying: 'This was no accident.'

Casanova faces an open murder charge, however, meaning he could still face second-degree murder or a manslaughter charge. 

Loss: Baby Tyler was found unresponsive in his parents' home on January 4, 2013 and an autopsy later revealed he had broken ribs, a lacerated liver, skull fracture, and bleeding on the brain

But the defense team, led by Muskegon County Public Defender Fred Johnson insisted that the dog story was true and that Casanova, who has some learning difficulties, told detectives he'd shaken the baby so that he could return home to his fiancee.

Johnson added that no family members had spotted signs of abuse on the little boy. 

'What happened here isn't murder,' Johnson said. 'This man idolized this child. ... It was a tragic accident.'

The trial has long been delayed due to legal wrangling. Most recently, prosecutors were granted permission to play Casanova's videotaped statement to cops.
