Former police chief Mark Kessler who was suspended for ranting against the government is to star in his own reality TV show

A former police chief who was suspended for ranting against the government is to star in his own reality TV show which could feature a militia-style group he started last month.

Speaking at a news conference in his attorney's office, former Gilberton Chief Mark Kessler said the group called 3 Percent Boots on the Ground already has a 'few thousand' members around the country.

The group will train monthly and require members, who are vetted by Kessler, to supply their own fatigues, combat boots and body armour.

Mr Kessler, 42,from Pennsylvania, said: 'Basically it's just a group of people who believe in the country, the Constitution, and what our founding fathers enacted.'

Despite Kessler gaining Internet fame for his rants against the government and gun control, he said the group does not advocate insurrection.

'My group is not affiliated with that in any way,' he said.

'It has nothing to do with overthrowing the government, as some people would like to believe.'

Gilberton officials suspended Kessler last year and tried to fire him after he posted videos of himself shooting borough-owned automatic weapons and ranting about liberals.

The videos had hundreds of thousands of views online.

Mr Kessler said he posted them to draw attention to the erosion of the Second Amendment and other constitutional rights.

Mr Kessler reached a settlement with Gilberton last week that pays him $30,000 and allowed him to retire from the force.

The former officer and his attorney, Joseph Nahas, said he signed a development deal with Relativity Media, the production company behind such reality TV fare as 'The Great Food Truck Race' on Food Network and Showtime's 'Gigolos.'

Mr Kessler said his show would focus on his life, the 3 Percent group and another group affiliated with the former lawman, the Constitution Security Force.

Mr Kessler and his compatriots believe the federal government is curtailing individual freedoms, but they don't advocate taking up arms against it, said Mr Nahas. 

He added: 'Say there is some sort of a civil riot. Mr. Kessler's group would not be part of the individuals who are promulgating the overthrow of government. 

'He would be on the side of trying to assist government that there isn't any kind of unruly behavior, the breaking of laws, and to be protecting his local populace from that.'
