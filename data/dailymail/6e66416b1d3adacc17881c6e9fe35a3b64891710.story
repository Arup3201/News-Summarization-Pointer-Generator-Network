Councils that dish out spot fines for feeding the ducks or putting up lost cat posters were accused last night of using the public as a ‘cash cow’.

Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles launched a ferocious attack on town halls for milking residents after a report revealed a five-fold increase in town halls’ use of penalty notices in a decade.

Nearly 1,400 fines are handed out every week for petty ‘offences’ such as handing out leaflets without a licence, dropping a cigarette butt in your own garden and overfilling rubbish bins, the study found.

Milking the public: Eric Pickles has slated local authorities for their abuse of spot fines

Residents have been fined up to £85 for feeding the ducks, putting up a ‘lost cat’ poster and walking a dog in a banned zone. The report, published by the Manifesto Club think-tank, found that fines shot up when councils introduced targets or outsourced fine collection to a private sector company.

Tory Mr Pickles said such practices were ‘unacceptable’ and would ‘undermine justice’. His comments signal that ministers are considering reining in such powers, which have been extended dramatically in the past decade.

On the up: Police issued 226,000 spot fines last year

‘This timely report highlights concerns over the proliferation of fixed penalty notices introduced by the last Labour government,’ he said.

‘Local councils should not be using residents as cash cows and persecuting people for petty or insignificant breaches of municipal rules. It is clearly unacceptable for external contractors to be paid based on the volume of penalties or the revenue raised – this both undermines the quality of justice and erodes public confidence.’ 

In 2001, around 13,926 spot fines were imposed by councils, mostly for litter and dog fouling. By last year, that had increased more than five-fold to 72,136, including 278 fines for unauthorised leafleting and 2,734 bin fines. The number of litter penalties increased to 63,883.

The report includes a string of cases in which members of the public claim they have been trapped by officials hiding in bushes or otherwise out of view waiting for them to commit an ‘offence’.

The report also says that police handed out 226,000 penalty notices for disorder last year. Their number has fallen from their peak in the mid-2000s but they are still used for minor offences and, worryingly, for more serious offences such as theft and criminal damage.

The use of spot fines by police and town halls combined has increased 16-fold in the past decade.

Abuse: The number of spot fines issued have increased five-fold in a decade

When police figures are included, the number of spot fines has risen 16-fold in a decade. Council cases include: 

A mother fined £75 for feeding ducks. The official who levied the fine said Vanessa Kelly’s one-year-old son Harry escaped a fine only because he was ‘too young to prosecute’. Mrs Kelly, 26, was fined for being outside ‘designated feeding areas for birds’ in Smethwick Hall Park, West Midlands.

A woman fined by Westminster Council for putting ‘commercial waste’ in her domestic rubbish because she had included a single work bank statement. Officials had searched through residents’ bins.

A couple threatened with a spot fine for ‘anti-social behaviour’ after they put up posters appealing for the return of their lost cat. Stephen and Heather Cope were told to remove the notices from lamp-posts in Whitstable, Kent.

A woman handed an £80 litter fine after her toddler grandchild dropped some crisps on the pavement. Barbara Jubb picked up the packet of Quavers in Crawley, West Sussex, but two crisps remained on the ground.

Tory MP Dominic Raab, who wrote an introduction to the Manifesto Club report, said the growth of council spot fines was a ‘troubling development’. He said: ‘We should be concerned by the arbitrary abuse of decent people in their daily lives by jobsworth officials or their private sector agents.’

Josie Appleton, the report’s author, said: ‘Too often, public authorities’ answer to every problem is simply to dole out fines. This is lazy at best and profiteering at worst. On-the-spot fines have their place for procedural violations such as parking, but this unprecedented expansion to criminal justice and the public services is a recipe for injustice and corruption.’

The report found 15 councils have outsourced fine collection to a private company, Xfor, which receives around £45 of every £75 fine. To October 2012 it had issued 43,498 fines and was paid £1.6million.

The report warns about the lack of a formal appeal system, meaning people must to go to court to challenge a fine, and accuses councils of targeting the normally law-abiding.

Richard Monkhouse, deputy chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, criticised the ‘inappropriate’ use of penalty notices for serious offences which should be dealt with in court.

‘This report highlights that a similar problem seems to exist where relatively trivial offences are concerned,’ he said. ‘Justice should be seen to be delivered fairly, openly and transparently, no matter what the offence.’
