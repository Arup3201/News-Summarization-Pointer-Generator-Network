A 13-year-old girl and her 18-year-old boyfriend are wanted by police for a crime spree across Kentucky after running away when they were confronted about their under-age relationship.

After fleeing from Grayson County on January 4, Cheyenne Phillips and Dalton Hayes trashed a cattle farm and stole two trucks, inflicting thousands of dollars of damage on one, authorities said.

They were last caught on surveillance camera on Monday at a Walmart in Manning, South Carolina but remain on the loose, the Grayson County Sheriff's Office said.

Outside the store, the duo were seen driving a stolen red 2006 Toyota Tacoma, which had a firearm inside when it was taken, police said.

On the run: Cheyenne Phillips, 13, and her boyfriend Dalton Hayes, 18, have been missing from their Kentucky homes for 10 days and are accused of stealing two trucks as they elude police officers

The teens were last seen at home earlier this month.

Cheyenne's father called police to report his daughter, a seventh-grader at Grayson County Middle School, missing when she failed to come home on the night of January 3. It emerged she was at Hayes' home,WHAS reported.

On January 4, police contacted Hayes' mother, Tammy Martin. Martin said her son had been dating Cheyenne for about three months - and that the young girl led her to believe she was 19, not 13.

'I texted Cheyenne and said the police are looking for you, she says why, I said they say you're under aged,' she recalled.

When Martin returned home, the pair were gone.

After the pair had been on the run for a week, police started seeking them for a different reason.

On Sunday evening, Jim and his wife Kathy McGrew returned to their home in Grayson County from church to find the pair stealing their truck, WHAS reported.

The teenagers raced down the road with police in pursuit, before tearing across a cattle farm and driving into the woods.

Mr McGrew searched for them in his plane while police used a K-9 unit, but all they found was the abandoned, wrecked truck with $7,500 worth of damage and a trail of clothes left behind.

But later that day, they stole the red Toyota Tacoma, the sheriff said. 

Tammy Martin said she's worried about what her son might do. 

'He's never went this long without contacting me, and it's really very stressful,' she said. 'I'm just worried that they're not safe anymore.' 

Hayes is wanted for custodial interference and other offenses. Both are suspected in at least two felony thefts and other crimes, Grayson County Sheriff Norman Chaffins said.

Missing: Police were notified of the relationship when Cheyenne's father reported her missing when she stayed the night at Hayes' home. After they learned they were sought over the age difference, they fled

He called for the two to be arrested or turned themselves in 'as their behavior is becoming increasingly brazen and dangerous'.

'We just want them to come in, turn themselves in because eventually it's just going get worse for them, and law enforcement, and we do not want that to happen,' Chaffins told WLKY.

Cheyenne was wearing a black, long-sleeve shirt and black sweatpants with brown and pink cowboy boots when she was caught on camera in South Carolina.

Hayes was wearing blue jeans, a University of Kentucky Wildcats t-shirt and black tennis shoes.

If you see the teenagers, police ask for you call 911.
