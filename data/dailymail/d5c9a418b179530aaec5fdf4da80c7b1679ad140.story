Prince Harry and his team of seriously injured servicemen have been able to travel to the starting line of their South Pole trek after blizzard conditions left them snowed in at their base camp.

The South Pole Allied Challenge teams had hoped to fit in skiing training at the starting point, which is 87 degrees south of their accommodation at Novo, to help them acclimatise to conditions.

But a snowstorm and very high winds left them largely confined to their rooms.

Now, with weather conditions having improved, the prince and and his 12 colleagues have arrived at start of the first stage of the 208 mile journey. 

Ice cool: Harry and his team were able to make the journey to the start line, 87 degrees south of their base camp at Novo, after severe weather conditions subsided

Time to go: The South Pole Allied Challenge team should have embarked to the start line a week ago

Speaking in his first interview from Antarctica, yesterday, Prince Harry said his brother 
Prince William would be jealous of his adventure, because it would mean 
getting away from 'a screaming child'.

The 
fourth-in-line-to-the-throne also told how proud he was to be alongside 
such 'extraordinary' people.

And although the 29-year-old prince seems to be relishing the challenge ahead, Harry admitted his father, Prince Charles, has expressed his 
concern.

The trek will see the team travel a 
distance of 208 miles, in temperatures of up to minus 50 degrees – all 
while carrying custom built arctic sledges known as pulks, weighing in 
excess of 11 stone.

Inspiring: Every one of the prince's team-mates has lost at least one limb serving in Afghanistan

But the prince insisted: ‘Every single
person who takes part in this challenge is extraordinary.

'The fact 
these guys have made it to this point is extraordinary and I count 
myself incredibly lucky to be part of it.'

Leading the way: During the trek, the teams will have to travel around 15km to 20km per day, enduring temperatures as low as minus 45C

Harry
should have embarked on the The South Pole Allied Challenge at the 
weekend but has been confined to base camp due to heavy snow and winds.

Speaking
to Sky News, the prince revealed that his brother - who has been 
concentrating on his responsibilities as a new father - was envious of 
the ambitious trek.

Harry said: ‘My brother, yeah, I think he's just quite jealous that I managed to get away from a screaming child.’

He
said the Queen and Prince Philip had taken the time to meet his 
Antarctic comrades - including Norwegian adventurer Inge Solheim - 
before the team set off.

He said: ‘What do my family think of this? I think the last time I said, "I don't think most of them know about it".

‘Obviously,
I took all the guys to Buckingham Palace to meet my grandmother and 
grandfather, which they absolutely loved, especially Inge Solheim who 
was very excited, which was fantastic.

‘My
father was a little concerned, but I obviously tried to keep him calm 
and explain the North Pole was the dangerous one because we're walking  
on a frozen ocean whereas this time there are crevasses.

‘But
hopefully the guides will take us around that. Apart from frostbite you
should be able to look after yourself as long as you just head south.’

The prince and the trek teams have been unable to fly to the second base camp because of snow storms

The South Pole Allied Challenge hopes to raise money for injured service personnel and also to inspire others injured in battle.

Every
one of the prince’s team-mates has lost at least one limb serving in 
Afghanistan, a statistic which clearly humbles the royal, who has been 
ribbed constantly about breaking a toe in the run up to their departure.

He said: 'I obviously broke my toe hoping to get out of the trip, that was a massive fail on my part!

Acclimatisation to the conditions has been hampered and the frustrated teams have been forced to rest

The teams from Britain, the U.S. and the Commonwealth have been unpacking and repacking their kit to pass the time

'Friends of mine said I really should have gone that step further and break a leg, but I chose not to.

'My toe is now 95 per cent, so I'm 
fine... whatever setbacks I've had is irrelevant against these guys, it 
was always going to be.'

Three
teams – one from Britain, one from the Commonwealth and a rival team 
from the U.S. - are due to head to the start of the race tomorrow, weather
permitting.

Harry said: 
‘Now we're here, unfortunately we've had really rubbish weather for the 
past four days which has meant a lot of lying around…. people pack and 
unpack more times... You would not imagine.

Prince Harry, right, said his brother, Prince William, is jealous he is undertaking the expedition

The prince, pictured at base camp, said he counts himself 'incredibly lucky to be part' of the expedition

‘For
me I've just kept it really basic on the advice of Inge from last time 
[when Harry joined part of a trek to the North Pole] - keep it basic and
you should survive.

‘Some of the guys have got so much comfort stuff - the Aussies are taking bricks of butter.’

He
added: ‘I should be more capable than them on paper, but so far we went
for one walk and everyone stuck together and it was nice to see how 
everyone was, some were uneasy at the start but then got it together.

Prince Harry is patron of Team UK in the 200-mile South Pole Allied Challenge 2013 expedition

‘Guy [Disney, a colleague] was always trying to convince me to go out 
for eight hour walks up in the hills. That's fine for you I told him, 
because you've got the time to.

'If I wasn't stuck in an office typing up
emails or sitting in a cockpit flying around the UK, I was in London 
doing something else, wearing a suit and tie - so it have been quite 
tricky

‘But I am fit and 
able, I'm 29 years old so I have no excuses so a lot of it's up here, 
and with the military backgrounds we all have, it should carry it over.’

The prince took time to pay tribute to his colleagues, whom he describes as ‘heroes who just wanted to be treated normally’.

Prince Harry said he was determined to take part in the expedition after having to leave a similar one in the North Pole for Prince William's wedding

‘Every
single person who takes part in this challenge is extraordinary. The 
fact these guys have made it to this point is extraordinary and I count 
myself incredibly lucky to be part of it,’ he said.

‘The
pressures and hurdles that these guys face, as you know, temperatures 
down to minus 50C, winds up to 70-90 - whatever it is - it is pretty 
unpleasant here.

'Just walking to and from dinner here is enough to have 
their eyes opened to the elements and to make you think to yourself "what have I got myself into?" Stupidity on my part!

‘For
me being pulled out of the North Pole [Harry had to leave a 2001 
expedition early to attend his brother’s wedding], It was just a case 
of I've just got to do this. Me and my big mouth!

'There was no way I 
could have dropped out of this, no way. I couldn't have done it. And 
also it's a great opportunity. I know it is slightly mad, but I've got 
four limbs and completely fine, well, almost fine, up here.

‘These
guys have got all these issues and life changing injuries that are 
really hard for them, so if I’m given the opportunity, and it means I 
can actually help these guys out, creating more awareness for them or 
whatever, then so what to minus 50 and 90 mph winds? Occasionally you've
got to put yourself through that for a good cause.

‘The
honour and the treat is mine to be able to spend time with these guys.

'They're not heroes, they don't want to be known as heroes, they're just 
people that have had life changing injuries who just want to get on with
it and have as normal a life as possible from this point forward - and 
that's the message we're trying to get across to everyone else.

‘These wounded guys are no different and they don't want to be treated any differently.’
