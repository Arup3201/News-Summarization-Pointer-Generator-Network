Paul Lambert expressed his dismay at referee Lee Mason after the official sent Aston Villa’s Gabriel Agbonlahor off for what looked like a legitimate 50-50 challenge.

Agbonlahor and former Villa winger Ashley Young clashed in the 65th minute in the 1-1 draw with Manchester United, with both players sliding in aggressively — though neither had their foot up or their studs showing.

But Mason immediately dismissed the Villa player — even though Lambert claimed that Young admitted that he had committed the foul.

‘If that’s a red card we may as well just pack up as it won’t be a game of football,’ said Lambert. ‘I spoke to Brad Guzan after the game and he said that Ashley Young admitted that he fouled Gabby — so work that one out.

Lambert said Villa would attempt an appeal against the decision, which will result in a three-game ban if upheld. ‘There’s a right good chance of appealing that — especially when a player’s admitted that he fouled Gabby,’ said Lambert. 

‘He admitted it to Brad — whether that helps or not. But that ain’t a red card. ‘I’m not worried about whether Ashley Young made a meal out of it or not. 

'It’s a tackle in which two lads have gone in for the ball and in my view is never a red card. Gabriel’s really down but I said to him there’s no way that’s a red card and I’ll stick up for him all day long on that.

Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert signaled his dismay at the dismissal of his forward during the match

‘He is not going to spring up and say ‘don’t send him off’, it would be a first in world football. Man United want to win the game and we want to.’

Despite the sending off, Lambert was happy with his team’s performance as they held in-form United to a draw after Radamel Falcao’s equaliser.

‘I thought we were excellent considering everything that went against us,’ the Villa boss added.

‘We had seven lads out, but we played some good stuff.’
