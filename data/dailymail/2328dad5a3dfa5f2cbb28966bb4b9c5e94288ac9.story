Throughout the years Walt Disney has helped animate some of the
most beloved children’s characters, and during World War II he was enlisted
to help the American war effort by designing a Mickey Mouse gas mask.

Fearing a chemical attack from the Germans the United States government distributed over 40 million gas masks to men, women, and children during WWII.

However, since adult masks were too heavy and frightening for children to wear, Disney helped to create a mask for kids that looked like his popular cartoon character Mickey Mouse.

During WWII Walt Disney helped to design a Mickey Mouse gas mask to protect children against chemical warfare. The mask pictured here is housed in The United States Army Chemical Corps Museum, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri

After the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor 
in 1941, Americans feared the threat of the war coming to their own 
soil, namely in the form of chemical warfare.

To protect against this threat the government massed produced non-combative gas masks.

Amongst the masks made for children was a Walt Disney
designed Mickey Mouse gas mask, to reduce children’s potential fear of wearing
the possibly life-saving mask.

The mask which looks like the Mickey Mouse’s face
attached to a branded air filter was designed to fit children aged
18 months to 4 years old.

‘The mask was designed so children would carry it and wear
it as part of a game,’ Major Robert D. Walk of the US Army Reserve Command wrote
in his essay The Mickey Mouse Mask. ‘This would reduce the fear associated with
wearing a gas mask and hopefully, improve their wear time and, hence,
survivability.’

Disney's Mickey Mouse gas mask was designed to eliminate children's fear of wearing the chemical warfare preventative device

The production of the Disney gas masks began in 1942, a
month after the Japan surprised Americans and attacked Pearl Harbor.

The Sun Rubber Company produced approximately 1,000 Mickey
Mouse gas masks with the company’s designer Dietrich Rempel and Disney’s stamp
of approval, Walk notes in his essay.

The Sun Rubber Company’s war efforts earned them an
Army-Navy ‘E’ rating for excellence in wartime production in 1944.

The protection of children during WWII against chemical
warfare produced efforts to make child-friendly gas masks in other countries as
well.

In addition to its child-friendly appearance, the Mickey Mouse mask was designed to fit a smaller head and weighed less than the adult gas mask. Seen here it is being fitted to a dummy

The United Kingdom also manufactured Mickey Mouse gas masks, although
they were not designed to look like the popular cartoon character.

The British version is just a blue and red gas mask but, the
name was retained for the product as part of the game designed to entice
children to wear it.

In Germany a child’s gas protective crib was designed to
shield infants against chemical attacks and protective hoods were made for
toddlers and older children who could not fit into the adult-sized masks.

As no chemical warfare ever befell the United States, many
of the gas masks were distributed to senior war officials at the end of the war as keepsakes or simply vanished over time, Walk writes.

Today the few Disney gas masks that have survived are all
housed in museums across the country including The 45th Infantry Division Museum in
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and the US Army Chemical Museum at Fort McClellan,
Alabama.

A deconstructed mask is also on display in The Walt Disney
Archives in Burbank, California.
