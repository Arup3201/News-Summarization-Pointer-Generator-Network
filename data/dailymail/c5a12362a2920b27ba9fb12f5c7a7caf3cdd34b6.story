Maurice Blackburn lawyer Jacob Varghese, who represents 72 asylum seeker babies, said the women were in a ‘state of utter despair’ about the welfare of their children.

Mr Abbott said he had not seen the report, but added: "If true, it is a harrowing tale".

However, he said the government would not capitulate to 'moral blackmail' when it came to border protection.

'This is not going to be a government which has our policy driven by people who are attempting to hold us over a moral barrel - we won't be driven by that,' he told the Nine Network on Wednesday.

'No Australian government should be subjected to the spectacle of people saying "Unless you accept us, I am going to commit self harm".'

Officials told the High Court that a boat carrying the refugees had been intercepted last week. They are still on the customs vessel in the Indian Ocean outside Australian territorial waters while their fate is decided.

The government promised to give three days' notice before attempting to return the group, which includes about 40 children, some as young as two.

Meanwhile, 41 asylum seekers who were handed back to Sri Lanka by Australia appeared in court to face charges of attempting to leave the country illegally. Five remained in custody while 27 were granted bail. Nine children were discharged.

Meanwhile, up to one dozen Sri Lankan mothers have attempted suicide on Christmas Island in the hope that their then orphaned children would get to reside in Australia

Late on Monday, the High Court granted an urgent temporary injunction preventing the return of the 153 to Sri Lanka ahead of Tuesday's hearing in Melbourne, where Commonwealth Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson undertook to give 72 hours' notice before moving them.

Refugee rights activist Ian Rintoul said the decision will come as an ‘enormous relief’ to the asylum seekers.

‘It is only a temporary fix, but it's blown a bit of a hole in the government's treatment of asylum seekers,’ he said.

The government had previously declined to reveal any details about the boat, citing its longstanding policy not to comment about on-water operations.

But Mr Gleeson told the High Court on Tuesday Australian authorities had intercepted the boat 12 miles from Australian territorial waters which meant their future would be determined by the Maritime Powers Act, not the Migration Act.

The matter will return to court within 21 days for a directions hearing.

There are also 153 Sri Lankan asylum seekers held onboard the Australian customs vessel in the Indian Ocean since being intercepted in the last week
